     "novel_text": "The night before the email, I was dusting cardamom over dough like a whisper. Wembley was a hum outside my window: a late bus sighing along the High Road, someone on a balcony laughing too loud, a fox flicking through the bins with the audacity of a king. The stadium lights\u2014when they\u2019re on, even in winter\u2014bleed a faint brightness into the sky, as if dawn is on repeat. I rolled the pin over pastry and kept my shoulders low, the way Staff used to tell me to keep them when the wind picked up on Salisbury Plain. Posture matters. Dough knows when you\u2019re tense, and so does a rifle.\n\n\u201cMum?\u201d Ava\u2019s voice was a thin thread from the doorway, not quite unravelled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s late, star,\u201d I said, believing that the sugar and the cardamom smoothed my voice. \u201cBack to bed. First bell\u2019s early, yeah? I\u2019ll bring you one in the morning if these work.\u201d\n\nShe came into the light, hair in a crooked plait, a school tie looped around her wrist like a bracelet. Thirteen going on some age I couldn\u2019t always make out. \u201cI could taste one now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d take the roof of your mouth off. They\u2019re scorching.\u201d\n\nAva pulled a face, kissed my shoulder, and padded back along the hall. She still has the light footfall of a child avoiding creaks. Sometimes that undoes me. I pinched the seam on a little parcel and tried not to think of the tour, of the way sand gets everywhere whether you invite it or not, into your socks, into your sleep, into the bit of you that cracks jokes while you\u2019re counting. When I looked up, the oven glass held my reflection: apron with flour graffiti, hair screwed up any which way, an old service tee because they\u2019re all soft after so many washes.\n\nI get called Sergeant at the drill hall. I get called Lila at the corner shop where Mr. Patel saves me the good mangoes because he says \u201cyou know the ones with the scent, Lila, not the bland ones that break your heart.\u201d I get called Mum here, in this little flat with two bedrooms and a squeaky washer that wants to be a helicopter. You learn to move between names the way you move between stances. Smooth. Without checking your footing every time.\n\nThe email came at ten fifty-seven the next morning, and I didn\u2019t see it until lunch, after I\u2019d come back from a run through Barham Park where the geese had a meeting about something vitally important and refused to make space for me. I was cutting through the kitchen when my phone lit with the blue bar and the subject line like a banner in a parade. London Home Bakers Challenge \u2014 Finalist Confirmation. I wiped my hands on the tea towel. Then wiped them again, because habit. And I looked.\n\nDear Lila, we are delighted\u2014\n\nI read the word delighted twice because it didn\u2019t sound like it belonged to me. It tasted like someone else\u2019s story. My hand found the edge of the counter and rested there so hard my knuckles went white.\n\n\u201cMum?\u201d Ava\u2019s bag collided with the hallway shoe rack in the kind of war the shoe rack always loses. \u201cMum. I think Mr. Hampton thinks you\u2019re in the Army. He asked me if your boots are shiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re murderous,\u201d I said, which made her smirk, and then my phone slide lit again because I\u2019d tapped it by accident, and the subject line was still there. I pulled my elbows in. \u201cAva, star. Come here.\u201d\n\nShe came, breath a little fast from the stairs, hair fallen out of the plait, tie gone. There was glitter on her cheek because of course there was. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook.\u201d I turned the phone to her. There\u2019s a tiny pause when your child reads something important over your shoulder, the pattern of their eyes moving across lines that can rearrange a week.\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d she said, then louder, \u201cno way! Is that the final-final?\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal-final,\u201d I said, and the words were both weight and helium. I breathed them in. Annoyingly, my hands were shaking, so I had to put the phone down so I wouldn\u2019t drop it into the sink and destroy my one ticket out of the ordinary.\n\n\u201cRing someone,\u201d Ava said, bouncing on her toes. \u201cRing\u2014Becky?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecks,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be on days maybe. She\u2019ll be standing on a range with a megaphone, and she\u2019ll make me do burpees to celebrate.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it. Do it. Please, do it. And can we tell Nani? Grandma will explode. Like, actually.\u201d\n\nI put a palm to her cheek for a second because sometimes she\u2019s still my child, not this roving comet. \u201cWe will. After homework. After\u2026 shoes. In the rack. A concept so far removed from your understanding.\u201d\n\nAva made a face and went to retrieve them. I breath-laughed and called Becks.\n\n\u201cSergeant Rahman,\u201d she answered, loud wind buffeting her phone. I could hear lads in the background calling timings, boots crunching on gravel. \u201cIf you want a day off, get a doctor\u2019s note. If you want a medal, get in line. If you want me to tell you to breathe, not in this tone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a nightmare,\u201d I said, grinning into the sink like a fool. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got news.\u201d\n\n\u201cScone news or military news?\u201d\n\n\u201cBaking,\u201d I said. \u201cFinals. I\u2019m in the final, Bex. The actual one. I would pinch you if you were here.\u201d\n\nShe whooped. She really did. A proper delighted sound that ricocheted around the range and off a few helmets, by the sound of it. \u201cListen up, you muppets,\u201d she shouted at someone, \u201cour Rahman\u2019s about to decorate the nation with her buttercream. You will address her as Ma\u2019am at all times and you will bring her piping tips at the double.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, laughing into my sleeve. \u201cDon\u2019t, please. I haven\u2019t told Mum yet. Keep it in the platoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know me, vault of secrets. Lila\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou deserve it. Don\u2019t roll your eyes\u2014I can smell it over the line. Don\u2019t. You do. You work until you\u2019re see-through, and you make cakes that made Private Lewis cry. Honest to God tears. Go get it. And if you need a palate cleanser for the judges, I\u2019ll bring MREs and we\u2019ll see who keeps a straight face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might hold you to that,\u201d I said, blinking stupidly at the kettle because crying in front of your friend while she\u2019s in charge of a live fire exercise is bad form. \u201cI\u2019ll call tonight. After Mum.\u201d\n\nAfter Mum meant a call that would last forty minutes where she would tell me what to wear, what to cook, and what not to say. After Mum meant I\u2019d listen to the familiar orbit of her worry and her pride, one around the other, like those old models of the solar system. I turned back to the dough, to the way flour dust settles on the surface of water like a first snow, and felt something open in me that had been tight all morning.\n\nOn the High Road Mr. Patel did that thing where he makes a face like he\u2019s not impressed even as his eyebrows go up. \u201cFinal. Hah. Final is just the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should put that on a banner,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd pay me royalties when it heals the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will make a cake like a story,\u201d he said, tapping his chest over his heart. He has known me since I was twelve and bought cheap gum from his counter because I wanted to be seen buying something. \u201cYou will put Wembley on the map, as if we are not already on the map every time it is a match and men shout. Something with saffron?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething with saffron,\u201d I agreed, and bought an outrageous pinch that made me feel extravagant and braver than is my baseline. I bought pistachios too, the ones with skins that flake under your fingers and stain them a little green, the good kind. The judge with the hair like a parfait once said my flavours were okay. Okay. The word had lodged in my throat like a pebble. Not just okay this time, I promised the nuts. Not just.\n\nBack at the flat, I leaned on the kitchen drawer that sticks and thought about the final, about the three bakes. Signature that shows who you are. A technical that you can\u2019t predict. A showstopper that makes them remember you even when the lights are down. The producers had called twice in the last week with questions that sounded innocuous. What\u2019s Wembley to you? What does your uniform mean in the kitchen? Who taught you to roll a roti without it sticking? They want a story more than a cake. They want tears in the right places and a grandmother in a sari in 4K. It\u2019s not untrue. It\u2019s just not everything.\n\nI called Mum. She picked up on the second ring as if she\u2019d been holding the phone in her hand, waiting for it to function as proof that life moves forward.\n\n\u201cAmu?\u201d she said, in the voice she used when I got my first trainer, my first stripe, my first careful disobedience. \u201cYou called. Are you hungry? I made dal. Not like how you make it, obviously you add so many things. I made simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the final,\u201d I said, because if I didn\u2019t say it at once, I might not say it at all. \u201cMum. They\u2019re putting me in the final.\u201d\n\nSilence, then a breath that sounded like she\u2019d been holding it since I said I was enlisting at nineteen. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, my heart. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. My Lila. Your father would have\u2026 he\u2019s probably waking the whole neighbourhood wherever he is, banging pots.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your domain,\u201d I said, and then we both breathed for a few seconds because grief is a thing you do alongside joy, like dancing with a limp.\n\n\u201cYou must wear that nice lipstick,\u201d she said when she had finished telling me that no child has manners as good as mine and gently implying that the other bakers will have sad, soulless sponges. \u201cThe dusky one. Not the bright one. It looks like you ate a chilli.\u201d\n\n\u201cMum.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your hair. Not messy. You think messy is art. It is not. It is lazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a stylist, Ma.\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\n\u201cA person they pay to wrangle my hair into looking like it belongs to a person who has slept. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not just this soldier they always go on about,\u201d she said, warming, the space heater of her worry moving down the room. \u201cYou are soft. People don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey might,\u201d I said. \u201cSometimes I forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall your aunties. No, I will call them. You will be too modest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cOkay. Mum\u2026 listen. Ava\u2019s fine. She\u2019s fine. But if she needs to stay with you for one of the filming days\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is always welcome. She knows her way to the biscuit tin without even looking. And the temple is doing that youth thing on Saturday; I will take her. She can pretend she is not listening while I talk to the aunties. She likes to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe likes to act like she just arrived from a planet where conversations do not exist,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks, Ma.\u201d\n\nAfter I hung up, I stood at the sink like I was waiting for something to materialise there, a coin at the bottom of a fountain. A car alarm warbled somewhere like a laugh you can\u2019t settle. I looked around this kitchen that has seen me icing cakes at two a.m., washing cam cream off my hands and watching the water go grey, telling Ava stories about the street festival when she was small enough to ride my shoulders. The table is second-hand oak with scorch marks from a pan that had opinions. The magnets on the fridge are souvenirs we didn\u2019t buy, gathered from friends who go places. The window frame needs painting. There\u2019s a tuppaware bowl under the sink catching a leak that has not been sorted despite six calls to the landlord. My whole life is in here, but not all of it fits.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why baking feels like an answer. There\u2019s a kind of command in the way dough yields to intention. You can fix texture with patience, temperature with knowledge, sugar with sour. You can put something in your hands and transform it into something you can offer. No one expects you to talk about the rest. They take a fork and they say amazing and you put another slice on their plate because the action of doing so is a grace that beats words to the line.\n\nAva did homework like it offended her, like the equations had insulted her footwear. Later, over dal and rotis that I should have let prove longer, she slid me a sheet from her bag.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201cArt thing,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cThey want a piece about home.\u201d\n\n\u201cA poem?\u201d\n\n\u201cA drawing. Or like\u2014anything. Mixed media. Mr. Hampton likes me too much, and I don\u2019t know what to do when a teacher likes me too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall my agent,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you think of when I say home?\u201d\n\nHer mouth did that thing where the corner lifts and drops. \u201cYou cooking,\u201d she said, not quite looking at me, \u201cand the little fan in the bathroom being annoying. Mrs. Devlin\u2019s radio with the horse racing, because she never turns it down. The bus braking. And like\u2014your boots by the radiator.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy boots have more personality than both of us put together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t leave them alone. They will go out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo a drawing,\u201d I said. \u201cNot perfect. Just the bits. Sometimes the bits together make more sense than the plan.\u201d\n\nShe picked at the edge of the table, at one of the scorch marks she has never confessed to. \u201cYour final. Will Dad come?\u201d\n\nI had to look down to roll a roti I didn\u2019t need to roll. \u201cHe might,\u201d I said. \u201cHe said he was in Manchester this month for the project. But he said he\u2019d try.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll come when the cameras are on,\u201d she said, unfussy and sharp. It\u2019s not untrue. \u201cHe\u2019s not all bad, Mum. He\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s a glitter person. He likes when things sparkle. You\u2019re more like\u2014bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she said, and when she smiled she looked five for a second, and that undid me worse than anything. \u201cYou\u2019re the thing that makes all the other things okay.\u201d\n\nLater, with her asleep behind her door, the tie abandoned on the floor like it had melted, I took my notebook from the drawer and wrote three words at the top of a fresh page: Showstopper: Wembley. It was obvious, maybe too obvious. But sometimes the obvious is right. I drew the arch before I could talk myself out of it, then two tiers of cake that could hold it\u2014saffron sponge with cardamom syrup, pistachio crunch Insert. I sketched piping like thread, like the henna my aunties used to draw in summer. I wrote balance? and underlined it a few times, then wrote rope sugar? because I am not a sugar artist and never will be but there are videos, and I have hands, and the night is long.\n\nThe next morning I ran past the stadium because that\u2019s what you do when a thing is in your head. One of the workmen waved, because they always do, because you become part of the neighbourhood\u2019s soundtrack if you repeat yourself long enough in one place. I held my pace and thought about the old men at the caf\u00e9 near Elm Road who drink tea like an argument, about the Polish lady at the laundrette who tells me whether the weather means sweaters just by the way she says \u201ctoday,\u201d about Mrs. Devlin who calls me soldier girl with a smile that\u2019s both missing and bright.\n\n\u201cYou in the telly show?\u201d she said that afternoon, when I brought her a slice of the pistachio cake for field research. \u201cThe one I pretend to hate and then have strong opinions about. That one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat one,\u201d I said. Mrs. Devlin had set up camp by her window with a blanket and a paperback that used to be a romance before the print wore out. The radio muttered horses. \u201cDon\u2019t tell the rest of them yet, or I\u2019ll have a party line on the stairwell.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be a vault,\u201d she said, tapping the side of her nose where a bit of powder had creased. \u201cDo they make you cry? You can cry if you want. No one on the route will make fun. They cry when Arsenal lose; they won\u2019t give you grief for a cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to hold it together,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to put sad music behind me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will. Don\u2019t you worry. Every time you inhale, the violins will wake up. Come in here on Sunday for my roast if you need a break from sugar. It will put hair on your chest if I don\u2019t overcook it. Which I might.\u201d\n\nShe watched me for a second like I was a soap she\u2019d been watching since episode one. \u201cYour girl. She\u2019s got that face on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one that says she wants to be a woman and a little girl and a dragon and doesn\u2019t know how to fit all those into one hoodie. Keep your mouth soft with her. She will tell you her secrets and then pretend she did not.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, because the urge to tell Mrs. Devlin about every small thing Ava does is not one I always win. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nAt the drill hall, I stitched my shoulders into the jacket like armour because it is. The air smells like oil and sweat and tea, a combination that will one day be bottled and sold as British Graft. Captain Dunne nodded at me with the precise nod that means both hello and you are ten seconds late, which I wasn\u2019t, but he has never been wrong a day in his life apparently. We did drills until my breath was a shape inside my chest, until the rhythm under my feet was the only thing in my head. There\u2019s a relief in obeying orders when you have been making all your own decisions in a kitchen where a teaspoon too much is a disaster and a heartbeat too late is a sugar burn.\n\nOn a break, Private Lewis\u2014the one who cried about the biscuits\u2014sidled up. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, because Becks had bullied them all into calling me some version of ma\u2019am that is both joke and respect, \u201cif you take the trophy thing or the cake stand or whatever they give you, can we polish it? I want to see my face in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring it by,\u201d I said, \u201cif I remember you when I\u2019m famous.\u201d\n\nHe looked panicked. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t forget me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I said, and I won\u2019t. The Army gives you back a part of your brain that civilian life takes without asking. It returns something about the way you belong to more than one person. It refuses to let you hunch.\n\nOn the bus home a woman with a baby asleep on her chest smiled at me, then looked at the boots tucked under the seat, then at my hands with flour in the lines I hadn\u2019t scrubbed hard enough. \u201cLong day?\u201d\n\n\u201cLong month,\u201d I said. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty-two hours,\u201d she said, patting the baby\u2019s back like a soft drum. \u201cNo one tells you about the bits where you feel like a sink with the plug out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one tells you lots of things,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you want the seat? The whole of it? I can stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take your cake, though. If that\u2019s an option.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cNot on me. But I could give you the address of my kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cBehave,\u201d she said, we shared a grin like we were conspirators, and for three stops the bus was a kind place.\n\nThe producer called that evening, a woman named Zoe with a warm voice like a scarf. \u201cHi, Lila, just checking the email found you well,\u201d she said as if it was a cliche she\u2019d dressed up a bit. \u201cCan I talk through the shoot days and a few questions? Great. So. The final will be three days\u2014one day rehearsal, two days shoot. We\u2019ll need you in the tent from six a.m. We\u2019ll mic you, we\u2019ll get some b-roll of you rolling stuff, sorry, and if you can bring a prop\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA prop?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything to do with your story. Boots? A family recipe book? A photo? We want to make sure your\u2014identity\u2014comes across.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy identity fits in the tent?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will if we ask nicely,\u201d she said, and then there was a little pause. \u201cWe loved your semifinal. The judges thought your pistachio layer was under. Sorry. That\u2019s their phrasing. Under. But they also thought your mawa cakes were a revelation. They used the word revelation. We didn\u2019t egg them to say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I ask. The technical. Is it\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNice try. Bring your courage and your patience. Also, could we shoot at your place? A tiny few minutes? Your daughter, perhaps, if that\u2019s okay. A scene in Wembley might be lovely. Stadium in the background. You know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll blur my house number, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will blur you into a film star,\u201d she said, and I liked her despite my cynicism. That\u2019s a danger with nice voices. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a runner drop a schedule. There\u2019ll be a car. And yes, catering. And a minders to stop people hugging you with jam hands.\u201d\n\nAfter we hung up, I looked at the boots by the radiator and tried to imagine them as a prop. They have clawed clumps of Salisbury mud in the grooves from last month\u2019s exercise that the kitchen brush will not respect. They are both exactly who I am and entirely a costume. I wiped the toe of one with my sleeve and laughed at myself, because of course I did.\n\nAva had left a note on the table in the ragged letters she still uses for me, on purpose, like she knows I will forgive any information if it\u2019s delivered in that font. Went to Rani\u2019s to return book. Back before eight. X. Rani lives two floors down with a mother who cooks like it\u2019s a game she intends to win and a father who laughs as if he\u2019s had a quiet life. I put the note on the fridge under the magnet shaped like a pigeon and thought about sending a message. Then I didn\u2019t. Ava must have told me with the note because she wanted the space to be a choice and not a permission. I can be good at not hovering. Sometimes.\n\nI tried the Wembley arch in sugar. It broke in three places. I tried it again and burnt my finger and said a word my mother wouldn\u2019t like. I watched a video where a woman with nails like weaponry coaxed sugar into ropes with the patience of a saint and made it look like breathing. I failed in the same place three times and then on the fourth try got one curve that I could rest a finger on without it falling to ruin.\n\n\u201cNaughty,\u201d I said to no one, and set it down like a crown.\n\nAt seven-thirty Ava came back with wind in her hair and that look like she\u2019d seen an idea and tried it on. \u201cWe watched a vlog,\u201d she started immediately, \u201cand it was this girl who lives in like\u2014Canada? And she draws everything she eats. Like she keeps a scrapbook of what her week tastes like. Imagine if we did that. Imagine if we\u2014you could draw your cakes. Not like in your notebook. Like art-art. War cake. Civilian cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that the binary,\u201d I said. \u201cNot everything is war\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that. But it is. It\u2019s like. Opposites in a bit of you. Mum. Your hands smell like toffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cOccupational hazard,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you want to lick a spoon and burn your tongue?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cI told Rani. About the final. She said if you don\u2019t win she\u2019s going to unfollow the show on principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her not to. The show needs all the love it can get,\u201d I said. \u201cIt spends too much money on bunting to be sustainable.\u201d\n\nAfter she had gone to draw in her room, leaving a sea of pens that would leak on my conscience, I took the notebook and wrote another list: Who to tell\u2014Becks told, Mum told, maybe Marcus if he calls; what to bake for the neighbours so they forgive the camera crew; what to say if the judge asks me why I think I have a chance. Not because I\u2019m a soldier. Because I know how to stand up after a thing breaks and make the next one better. Because I know how to count to ten while sugar becomes thread. Because I know what saffron tastes like on a lucky day, and how to cheat when it isn\u2019t one.\n\nWhen Zoe and her two camera colleagues came on the Tuesday, Mrs. Devlin dressed like she was going to Ascot and waved from her doorway even though they were not filming her. \u201cNot today, Mrs. Devlin,\u201d Zoe said with a grin that said maybe tomorrow, not ruling it out. They made a film of me chopping pistachios and staring thoughtfully at my oven as if ovens have anything new to say. They filmed me tying my boots, and Ava leaned in a doorway and watched like she was memorising the angle of my fingers, which made me want to do it tidier.\n\n\u201cWhat was your hardest day,\u201d one of the camera lads asked, too quick, like he hadn\u2019t broken in his own shoes.\n\n\u201cIn what,\u201d I said. \u201cLife? Baking? It\u2019s all the same day.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say the tent,\u201d Zoe said softly, a glance passing between them. \u201cFor now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you ask my cake to be someone it isn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen you ask my cake to be polite. It\u2019s a terrible liar.\u201d\n\nThey laughed, and I warmed to the fact that they laughed. The mic on my shirt made my heart sound like a drum in my ear; it\u2019s disconcerting to listen to your own pulse, like being in a queue for something you\u2019re not sure you want. We did b-roll in the little market, me weighing out spices, talking to Mr. Patel about the saffron as if I was being filmed for a wildlife documentary and the spice was a rare bird. On the way back we passed the stadium at a distance where it looks like a spaceship has landed and the neighbours didn't complain. The arch in the winter light was the exact colour of new money. It made the sugar arch I\u2019d made look like an apology. Good. I needed the challenge.\n\n\u201cI want to get you with your daughter,\u201d Zoe said after a take where I said something trite about Wembley and then immediately regretted it. Even I could tell I sounded like a leaflet. \u201cJust a few lines. Nothing intrusive.\u201d\n\nAva came to stand beside me, and for a second our hips lined up the way they used to when she was shorter, and my heart did that flipbook thing where it remembers every age of her in one go. \u201cSo,\u201d Zoe said to her, \u201cwhat\u2019s your mum like in the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cA menace,\u201d Ava said neatly, and even Zoe laughed. \u201cShe burns her fingers and forgets to feed herself and sings really badly. But also\u2014she makes you think you can do anything because she makes cakes go in two directions at once. Like\u2014up and inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very pretty,\u201d Zoe said with honest admiration. \u201cYou have a writer.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a girl who doesn\u2019t tell her when she\u2019s going to Rani\u2019s until she\u2019s already there,\u201d I said, and Ava bumped me with her shoulder.\n\n\u201cI left a note,\u201d she said. \u201cI left a note on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was in your handwriting.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine that,\u201d she said, drawling, and Zoe got her b-roll of us being humans.\n\nAfter they left, after the door shut and the house exhaled like you do when you hang up after a too-long call, it rained in the kind of gentle, unambitious way that makes London look like a film from the seventies. I made tea. I made the sugar arch again and failed twice more and then made one that was almost there. I thought about the boot camp in the rain when Staff had shouted at us with passion because our anger was a shield we could get rid of eventually. You can get used to anything, is both a threat and a comfort. Ava did her art homework and put a bus in the middle of our table and drew it with a hand that has decided to become precise. I told her it was good and she shrugged because compliments itch at this age.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being weird,\u201d she said finally, not looking up from her page.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re sensitive. You can tell when people are excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited,\u201d she said, and then the corner of her mouth did that thing again. \u201cDon\u2019t be excited like\u2014like it\u2019s the only thing. Be excited like it\u2019s one drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d I said. \u201cI can be a drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and smiled full on. It made her bright. It made her huge. I watched her and thought, I am very lucky. Even when it\u2019s hard, this is the good bit. I felt like this even when I woke at three a.m. and wrote half a page in my notebook about the way icing should be the thickness of a ribbon and then realised I had written it over a shopping list fully covering the word milk so I would forget to buy it in the morning.\n\nOn Thursday I took muffins to the drill hall and told Lewis that heroes polish their own trophies, and he laughed and said \u201cyes, Ma\u2019am,\u201d like he meant both halves of it. On Friday I called Marcus and said, \u201cAva has the school talent show next week\u2014do you want to come,\u201d and he said he\u2019d try but it was all the way from Manchester to Wembley and he had a meeting that might turn into drinks so he couldn\u2019t promise. On Saturday I called my auntie in Harrow and listened to her tell me what the judges like, as if she had a direct line into their sweet hearts. On Sunday I stood at my window and watched the stadium glint and thought, arched things are the city\u2019s love language. Bridges. Spans. Ellipses. The shape of a held breath.\n\nLater, after I burned the first batch of sable biscuits because I was answering a text and not watching the oven like a hawk, after Ava and I argued about nail polish that she swore she wouldn\u2019t wear to school and then did, after the neighbours yelled because the TV was too loud and then laughed and then apologised, I found the hole in the piping bag with my index finger and pressed it flat with tape and called that innovation. I asked the kitchen aloud, because kitchens keep secrets, \u201cAm I ridiculous.\u201d The kitchen did not answer, which was a relief. It means it has boundaries.\n\nIt is possible to love more than one thing. It is possible, as my uncle says while never admitting which football team he actually supports, to hold contradictions like they are groceries. You have to carry them carefully or the eggs break and then everything smells like something you can\u2019t get out. I love a parade square and I love a loaf tin. I love the noise at the end of our road when Brent wins anything and the quiet in the tent when a judge tastes the thing and doesn\u2019t speak for a second longer than you can endure. I love my kid. My fierce, bright, all-angles kid. And I am very good at pretending I am not frightened.\n\nThe night before the first final shoot day, I lined tins like it was a ritual my grandmother taught me, deliberate as prayer. I wrote a list that was partly ingredients and partly spells: saffron warmed with milk, pistachios hand-chopped because the processor bruises, sugar at hard crack, not soft, breathe. I put the boots by the door and looked at them like they were a decision. I took the sugar arch from its hiding place and held it lightly in both hands and walked across the kitchen with it like a person with another person sleeping on their chest. I placed it on the top tier dummy cake and it held for a breath, two, three.\n\nAva came out in her socks, a hoodie over pyjamas, and stood with her hands stuffed in her pocket like they were getting told off. \u201cYou ready,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d I said. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes because she is thirteen and she has artesian wells of disdain. And then, softer, like a coin in the bottom of a jar, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, now I\u2019ll cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me to make you one of those phone things. Like when you make a phone on Loud but not too Loud so you don\u2019t miss the alarm and also not the neighbours.\u201d\n\n\u201cA timer?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cThat.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake me one of those.\u201d\n\nShe set it on the counter with the complete seriousness of a mission. We both looked at it, phones glowing, the kitchen a little mess with promise. The city outside was awake and restless and not interested in our bit. I went to bed and lay awake and rehearsed breathing until the breathing happened on its own, and every time I thought of the sugar arch I forced myself to think of the ordinary arch: the one that keeps a roof from falling, the one your foot makes in a shoe, the one a hand makes when it holds something tender but not fragile.\n\nIn the morning the car pulled up at six and the runner with a jacket on a jacket knocked my door like he was apologising. \u201cMornin,\u201d he said, his eyes already too awake. \u201cReady for your close-up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI look like a person who has not slept,\u201d I said, and he grinned because everyone thinks that\u2019s charming on telly. In the kitchen, against the wall, the sugar arch waited. In the bedroom, Ava waited. She will be late to school by half an hour, and I will write a note that says family things, sorry, life. She slid her bag onto one shoulder and came to look at me in the hallway like I was going on a mission she packed, but couldn\u2019t follow on this one.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d she said, like a briefing. \u201cYou\u2019re good at this. You\u2019re not gonna apologise in your eyes all the time, okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make no promises,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d she said, because she\u2019s my commanding officer sometimes. \u201cAnd call me at lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said. \u201cAsk Mrs. Devlin to give you a lift if the bus is doing that thing again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bus is always doing that thing,\u201d she said, and then, soft again, that coin again, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you more.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a competition,\u201d she said, smiling like the floor was absolutely safe. For now. For now, I held the image like a little candle cupped in my hands: her, my kitchen, a runner with a jacket on a jacket, the stadium half appearing through fog as we drove. The tent would be cold and full of bunting and a thousand small humiliations and glories. I would put butter in a bowl and make something rise.\n\nIf you ask me now what I thought would be the worst thing that could happen, I\u2019d tell you something to do with sugar temperature or a handshake withheld. It should be obvious. That life has other plans. But the novel I was living seemed to have one plot for once. Bake. Try not to swear. Remember to drink water. Remember to tell your daughter exactly where you are, minute by minute, even when she sighs.\n\nThe car turned left, and the tent came into view like a promise you can poke. You try not to jinx it. You do anyway. You step out. You carry your boots like a prop and your heart like a weight you\u2019re proud of. You check your phone for messages you already know aren\u2019t there yet. You walk forward. You think, I have never been more me. And for a minute or two, before the cameras find their angles, before the ovens decide who they like, it feels like that might be enough.The tent was colder than television admits. The air had that damp, polite chill of a church in March, a promise that heat would arrive eventually if you were devout enough with your body. Crew in black moved like crows with useful jobs. Bunting did what bunting does, which is stand in for joy so you don\u2019t have to provide it on cue. They put me at Station Seven, which felt both lucky and like a dare. Two to my left, a woman with a fringe like she\u2019d cut it in protest folded a tea towel like origami. To my right, a bloke with forearms that belonged on a builder ran his fingers over the dial of his oven as if he could romance it into good behaviour. I slipped my boots under the bench the way you put a hand under a spine you\u2019ve promised to hold. Zoe gave me a thumbs up from near a light and mouthed, \u201cBreathe,\u201d which made me laugh, and the laugh fogged the little window on my oven, which I took as a sign that the day was already tilted in my favour.\n\n\u201cIntroduce yourselves, then breathe,\u201d said the host whose jokes always sound like he\u2019s footnoting them. \u201cTell us your story without telling us your story. Tell us by pastry.\u201d\n\nSignature was first because the day has to start with something that looks a lot like hope. The brief was home in twelve hand pies, baked not fried because we are respectable and nobody trusts an oil vat in a tent with this many cables. \u201cGujiya,\u201d I told Zadie when she came to ask about my plan, because she always wants me to name things like a person who belongs at a naming. \u201cSemolina mawa, saffron milk, pistachio. I\u2019m brushing them with ghee and baking hot, so the seams set before they open their mouths to complain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHome in a crescent,\u201d she said, approving, because if you tell an English presenter a thing is home, they will smile even if it is a snake. \u201cHow many times have you made these?\u201d\n\nI held my hands apart as if a number could fit there. \u201cEnough to know when I\u2019m lying to myself,\u201d I said. \u201cNot enough to be bored.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and moved on to Builder Forearms, who was making hand pies that were actually Cornish pasties in a tux. He told a story about his Nana Eileen that made me want to call mine just to remind her I still existed.\n\nDough knows when you\u2019re tense. I said it out loud in my head and moved my shoulders down. Gujiya dough wants to be short without sulking. You cannot bully it. You coax it with just-warm ghee and milk that has looked a saucepan in the eye and decided not to boil. My fingers did the thing they do when flour and fat meet, that gentle snowing that turns into sand and then into a language you can half-remember. While the semolina toasted in more ghee than my mother would approve, I ground cardamom with sugar until the room remembered me. The smell did what I needed it to. The crew looked up. Someone near the end bench made a content noise without consent. I didn\u2019t grin, but my mouth thought about it.\n\n\u201cBoots,\u201d said the judge with the hair like a parfait, stopping at my station with that concerned kindness that reads well on camera. \u201cInteresting prop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re shoes,\u201d I said, because sometimes I can\u2019t help myself. \u201cThey keep my feet off the floor. They\u2019re also the only clean pair I had left.\u201d\n\nHe laughed as if I\u2019d blessed him. \u201cAnd this is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGujiya,\u201d I said again, patient, like a sign language interpreter for a tourist. \u201cMy aunties pinch the seams tighter. I like them a little rustic because that\u2019s truth.\u201d\n\nMireille slid in beside him in a cloud of citrus perfume and mercy that she keeps hidden. \u201cCardamom,\u201d she said, stealing a breath that wasn\u2019t hers. \u201cGood choice. Many people panic and go cinnamon as if they are sending a postcard to a spice rack. What fat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhee,\u201d I said. \u201cBrushed. Not drowned.\u201d\n\nShe gave me a look I could have used as a measuring spoon. \u201cDo not be cautious to the point of sorrow,\u201d she said and moved on, leaving me newly terrified of both restraint and excess, which is an achievement I might frame.\n\nI filled the little moons with the mawa mixture, tightened the seams with a pinch-and-twist my hands remembered before my head did, and set them in neat rows like soldiers who have decided for once to be kind. Ghee brushed on, the gold you earn in a pan sliding into their shoulder blades. Into the oven, hot, crowded, a prayer of sugar under my breath. Around me, puff and chant and panic. Builder Forearms swore gently because one of his pasties had mouthed off and opened. Fringe folded her towel again as if she could solve the concept of time with corners. Cameras lurked like cats that had graduated from hunting sparrows to details.\n\nWhen they came out, mine were more bronze than I\u2019d planned, which meant the bottom heat was closer to hell than heaven. I moved them to the rack like I was disarming something, tapped the underside of one with a fingernail, listened for crisp, and almost cried from relief at the sound. Piping a little saffron glaze felt like vandalism until the scent came up and told me I\u2019d done the right thing.\n\n\u201cTwelve,\u201d said Zadie, counting unnecessarily because the point of this part is that we can count. \u201cThey look like my grandmother\u2019s earrings.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine would bite you,\u201d I said, and she laughed again and I wanted, as I often do in this tent, to be less charming and more prepared.\n\nJudging is a theatre where your face must be both brave and soft, where you must stand still and let people talk about your work as if it happened without your hands. They sliced. The sound made my lungs more useful. Parfait Hair said, \u201cWell-crimped, generous filling,\u201d and I tried not to look like a dog who has been told he is good. Mireille took a bite and did that thing where she doesn\u2019t show you the thought until she\u2019s sure it will live. \u201cYou have a heavy hand with cardamom,\u201d she said, and my heart sank, and then she said, \u201cand God bless you for it,\u201d and my heart stood back up, saluted, and went for a jog. \u201cThe semolina is toasted properly. There is no raw squeak. The ghee is shy. Don\u2019t make me sad in the mouth. But. You have brought something of yourself and not tried to translate it out of its clothes. It is a good first page.\u201d\n\nWhen you have had other adults tell you for years how to be and not be, to have one say \u201cgood first page\u201d hits like water after a long exercise with a dry canteen. I put my hands behind my back so I wouldn\u2019t reach out and feed her another one, which is apparently frowned upon.\n\nThe technical was a slap from the universe hiding behind a twisty ribbon. \u201cParis-Brests,\u201d the host read with glee from a card he could have used as a roof tile. \u201cBut mini, and made with a pralin\u00e9 you will all claim to have known how to make since birth.\u201d We turned our papers over and found only a paragraph in a font smirking at us. Choux doesn\u2019t care about your ego. Choux cares if you have understood that four elements can be one if you pay attention for exactly the right length of time. I set water and butter to simmer like I was starting a romance, sieved flour as if my sieve had offended me, and worked with a wooden spoon until the paste was glossy enough to play itself in a music video.\n\nPiping rings is a study in humility. Mine were even, which is not a thing I say out loud often, and they baked to a stand that made me remember why I love a discipline with rules and then, under the rules, more rules you discover like a secret room. Pralin\u00e9 wanted to scorch, then to sulk, then to become silk and let me believe in it again. I cracked the caramel at exactly the point where it wanted to be a blade and caught it with hazelnuts that knew me better than most people. When you make something so good your eyes widen even alone, you think about who you\u2019ll hand it to first. In the tent, it\u2019s a camera. It\u2019s also Mira, a girl from Tottenham with a laugh like hands clapping, and Len, who told me he came to baking because scaffolding got old and cake did not.\n\nThe technical judging is blind only in the way a parent is blind at a school performance where your kid is dressed as a planet. Everyone knows the handwriting. Mine were nearer the front than I deserved, and when they said second I adopted the face of a person who had expected third and been promoted through no fault of their own. The camera loved it. The camera always loves slightly damp restraint. I had to force myself not to look for Ava in the crew, as if she\u2019d snuck in between lighting stands with a hoodie and a smug expression and a text that said you see.\n\nAt lunch I rang her, the runner guarding me like a polite elk. \u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d she said, and I could hear the bus sulking in the background and someone playing drill on a phone they weren\u2019t meant to have at school.\n\n\u201cAlive and sugared,\u201d I said. \u201cGujiya landed. Technical didn\u2019t kill me. How\u2019s your day?\u201d\n\n\u201cArt teacher cried at a slideshow,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the photos of classes from 1998 to now made her spiral. She\u2019s fine. Mrs. Devlin says the lift is being odd, like a child. Be proud of me for eating an apple.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlamboyantly proud,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be late. I\u2019ll leave a note on the table because I am a woman of my word.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut it under the pigeon,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Mum\u2026 good luck with the showstopper tomorrow. Don\u2019t put a whole stadium on a cake. That\u2019s extra.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I put a pretend bit of a stadium.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen that\u2019s not extra,\u201d she said solemnly. \u201cThat\u2019s artistic.\u201d\n\nWe hung up on a shared eye-roll, which is a family tradition. I stood with a cup of tea that tasted like it had been made in 1953 and looked at the tent as if it had secrets I could mine. Day One was a rehearsal for a feeling. Day Two was when you tried to make the feeling stand up on its own legs and walk around.\n\nAfter lunch we filmed the bits where you pretend you\u2019re seeing the tent for the first time. The hosts did a bit where they attempted to carry a cake like a baby and almost dropped it, and the sound engineer made a noise like he\u2019d seen God die. We all laughed because solidarity looks good on us. Zoe came to me with a quick whisper about the morning call sheet and the sugar temperatures and the crew being on my side because cameras like anyone who understands that patience is a substance.\n\nThe day ate itself the way filming days do. We did interviews in a corner where bunting looked bored. \u201cWhat does it mean to be here,\u201d the camera asked in a voice that had been trained to sound like your aunt. \u201cIt means work looks like love in better lighting,\u201d I said, which was almost the truth. I said a softer thing about Wembley and my mum and saffron, because TV likes saffron, and imagined Mr. Patel nodding like an uncle who had sponsored my speech.\n\nWhen I got home, I wrote a shopping list for the morning that looked like an apology to all the ingredients I had ever misjudged. I sharpened my small palette knife the way other people sharpen knives with real purpose. I tucked the sugar arch under a clean tea towel as if I could protect it from physics. Ava and I ate pasta like a team requiring carbs and watched a clip of a documentary about women in uniform that made her say, \u201cYou look better than them,\u201d with a seriousness that could buy a house. \u201cThey look like they haven\u2019t slept in three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree and a half,\u201d I said. \u201cBed,\u201d and she made a long show of announcing that being told to go to bed is an injustice that should make the papers. After she shut her door, I took my boots and wiped them down again, minding the mud from Salisbury that won\u2019t respect removal, and set them by the door next to the bag with the emergency repair kit that contains more than it should\u2014spare spatulas, spirit level, cocktail sticks, sugar thermometer, ribbon, tape, a charm my mother thinks is a charm.\n\nMorning smelled like toast and fear. The runner had less jacket this time, which meant it might rain. The car cut through fog that made hedges look like old men. The tent rose out of the pallor like a ship with bunting, which is just a tall story. They sent us into hair and makeup with a speed that made me think someone had found a stray hair in the batter of the world. Mireille wore a coat the shade of a plum that has given up. Parfait Hair had clearly slept with better pillows than the rest of us. The hosts were matching in a way that was either planned or fate twisting our ankles for fun.\n\n\u201cShowstopper,\u201d Zadie said in a tone you could stand a chair on. \u201cWe want something that cannot be ignored. We want a piece of you. We want structural integrity with emotional notes. We want you to reference London in form and flavour. We want the nation to argue about it on social media without being too mean. You have five hours. Off you go.\u201d\n\nThe bench became a battlefield I knew how to walk. My saffron sponges went in early like good soldiers and came out flat enough to stack without swearing but with enough lift that we would not have to fake the word sponge later. Pistachio crunch melted into a minor disaster and became, with the intervention of butter and profanity, something that would snap under a tooth without breaking a crown. The city\u2019s colours were in everything if you knew where to look\u2014crimson from pomegranate jewels in a syrup I reduced until it told me to stop, gold from saffron that had been warmed in milk and made to tell its stories, green from nuts that stained my fingers like the week does.\n\nAnd then there was sugar.\n\nThe arch is a question you ask sugar while it is in the mood to answer. You have to catch it between states, when it is a conversation and not a verdict. I heated it to hard crack like I had all my life, which is to say three times in a tent and a few times in a kitchen where the extractor fan thinks it is a politician. The first pull was too coy. The second broke in a gesture that would have been an insult if it were human. The third found a music in my hands that I had to honour by not getting clever. I laid it along a mould I\u2019d made from the inside of a tubing the crew had loaned me and said thank you to an inanimate object and meant it. My fingers found the burn at the edge of the middle joint and accepted it like currency. I used up all my good words saying, \u201cSoft,\u201d to myself and, \u201cNow,\u201d and, \u201cNot yet.\u201d When it held its shape with that defiant curve, I made the mistake of liking it too much and had to put it down and walk away for two full breaths so the universe would not be tempted to punish me for hubris.\n\nAround me, collapses in miniature and triumphs in secret. Len\u2019s tower learned about gravity and then forgot again thanks to skewers hidden like a crime. Mira decorated with a steady hand and a pink the exact shade of a lot of girls\u2019 bedrooms in the nineties. Fringe swore under her breath in a language I couldn\u2019t place but understood. Parfait Hair loitered like a benevolent vulture. Mireille was nowhere and everywhere, a perfume trail and a sudden voice at your elbow saying, \u201cThat ribbon is too much,\u201d and moving on as you reconsidered your whole relationship with ribbons.\n\nAt one point a host put his elbow on my bench and said, \u201cWembley, eh?\u201d and I said, \u201cYou\u2019d think I could ignore it,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou can ignore a lot of things. We prefer if you don\u2019t ignore the clock,\u201d and we both looked up at a number that meant different things to different hearts.\n\nIt happened as I was painting a last thin line of saffron glaze along the edge of the top tier, the way you underline a word in a letter to yourself. My phone, which I had surrendered to the runner like a contraband I wanted back later, reappeared in Zoe\u2019s hand. She didn\u2019t go to anyone else. She came straight for me, her gentle voice set aside like an apron she couldn\u2019t wear right now. \u201cLila,\u201d she said, and my body knew something my brain hadn\u2019t caught yet. \u201cSchool called. They say it\u2019s not\u2014sorry\u2014they say it\u2019s not an emergency emergency. But they want you to call.\u201d\n\nYou build a life where you can translate tone faster than words. My hands did the thing where they put something down so carefully it might as well be love, and my face did the thing where a smile slides from the edges inwards and sets. \u201cWho?\u201d I said, though I knew. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeputy Head,\u201d she said. \u201cAva left at lunch and didn\u2019t go to the next two classes. They\u2019re doing attendance now. They think she walked out with a friend. They\u2019ve tried her phone. It goes to voicemail. They know you\u2019re here. They wanted to say they\u2019re not panicking. And they are sorry. And would you call.\u201d\n\nThe sugar arch looked like a solution to a different problem, which is to say it was very beautiful and very useless. Mireille somewhere behind me said something in a bright tone to someone whose ganache had split, and the sound felt like it came down a tunnel. Zoe\u2019s hand hovered like she wanted to touch my arm and had filed the desire as unprofessional. The timer said an hour and twenty left, which is both a whole life and no time at all.\n\nI took the phone and stepped away from my bench, which is a treachery in a showstopper and also the only thing to do. Outside, the light was that mean winter brightness that makes you squint at even your own intentions. The grass had given up its green for the day and lay there like a carpet no one could afford. I walked behind the tent where the smokers go to pretend they\u2019re having a crisis and the producers go to pretend they can fix it. I dialled with a thumb that knew its job and listened to the deputy head tell me carefully that children run from things and to things and sometimes just out of rooms because there is a world the size of a shoe box in their chest and it needs air.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re checking the usual places,\u201d she said, and her voice was the voice of a woman who has said too many times, nothing is wrong until it really is. \u201cRani\u2019s. The library. The park. We have a supervisor in a car doing the loop. If you\u2019re happy, I can nip to yours. Mrs. Devlin is on our list. She is on all the lists. She is, I must say, a formidable woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheck the roof of the shopping centre,\u201d I said, because I know where the kids go when they want sky but not questions. \u201cShe\u2019s not a jumper. She just likes the wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the woman said, and I understood that she was not picturing wind. \u201cDo you want us to call her father.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said, which is a lie you tell because it gives you a job. \u201cIf she comes back in, if she texts, if you even think you see her shadow, call me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is a good child. This is a\u2014blip.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren are blips,\u201d I said, and we both took comfort from the thought that this was a normal misbehaviour and not a substitution for the terror we keep under the stairs. I hung up and for a second, exactly one, I pressed my forehead to the cold white of the tent wall like I could download steadiness from canvas.\n\nZoe appeared around the corner but stayed out of my orbit in a way that made me want to go to her and also keep the distance for the sake of not breaking. \u201cWe can stop,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can pause you. We can\u2014what do you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be two people,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to be inside standing sugar up and outside standing outside my child\u2019s head. I want to know what she is thinking when she closes a door. I want to be un-filmed. I want to stand in my kitchen and make dal and wait for the key in the lock that means ordinary. I also want to finish this and not be the woman who went out with a cry. I want too much.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t say that was human. She didn\u2019t tell me to be brave. She did a thing I will carry with me which is that she looked at my face and then at my hands and then at the grass and said, \u201cWhat do you need, right now,\u201d as if the present can be sliced into pieces you can eat without choking.\n\n\u201cI need to call Mrs. Devlin,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd Rani\u2019s mum. And my mother. And I need to tell someone at the school that she left a note on the fridge that says where she\u2019s gone when she actually does, because I am a fool who thinks thirteen is a rational number.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen call,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be horrible and time you, because the cake does not stop being cake simply because life has cracked its knuckles. I will come and get you if something changes. I will station a runner at your kitchen if you want. I will, at the very least, make tea that doesn\u2019t taste like sadness.\u201d\n\nThe calls were what they always are in a crisis that is not a crisis yet. Mrs. Devlin had seen her at eight with a hoodie and a grin and then had not. \u201cShe had that fizz,\u201d she said, and I could hear the horses on the radio doing their slow thunder. \u201cShe will come back even if she goes out. That girl is a boomerang.\u201d\n\nRani\u2019s mum thought she was at mine, which meant the girls had done the thing where they covered each other like soldiers in a story. My mother said a prayer out loud in the kitchen in a voice that made me seventeen and the worst. Marcus\u2019s phone went to voicemail where he was in love with his own competence. I left a message that was clean, because you don\u2019t put panic on tape if you can help it.\n\nWhen I went back into the tent my hands were steady in a way that made me suspicious. My bench smelled like I had not left. The sugar arch had developed an audible opinion about my absence by cracking along the least forgiving line, right at the shoulder where the pretend strain becomes a real one. I stood there and did not swear because someone\u2019s mother was watching. I picked it up as if it had always been like that and the crack was part of its history. I took my emergency ribbon and made it into a design choice. I did the thing you do in barracks and kitchens and the middle of the High Road when a bus has splashed water up your entire leg. I pretended that this was the plan.\n\nLen caught my eye and nodded like a man who has put more things back together than he broke. Mira mouthed something that could have been you got this or breathe or both. Fringe offered me a spare dowel like a candlestick in a blackout. Zadie came by and lifted an eyebrow at the ribbon and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s couture,\u201d and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d and we both laughed as if we could see the book jacket.\n\nWhen the judges came for the final walk and the cameras held their breath and the hosts leaned in like gossipers, the arch held. It was not the arch of my dream. It was the arch of a city that knows scaffolding. It was patched and pretty and mine. Parfait Hair did the thing with his hand where he measures without measuring and said, \u201cAmbitious,\u201d and I didn\u2019t apologise with my eyes. Mireille tapped the ribbon like a teacher tapping a note and then cut through to the crumb. She ate. She was quiet for the length of a small prayer. \u201cBalance,\u201d she said finally, and I could breathe because she had used the word I\u2019d written in my notebook as if that had summoned it. \u201cThe saffron knows its place. The cardamom is not showy here. The pistachio comes in as a soft crunch in the second sentence. The icing is a touch thick. Do not think your sugar work is the story when the cake speaks this way. But you wanted to be remembered. And you will be.\u201d\n\nThe cameras saw me swallow hard, and I let them. I pictured Ava with wind in her hair on the roof of the shopping centre eating a packet of crisps she was too proud to buy herself. I imagined the deputy head\u2019s little car doing loops as if Wembley was a question that could be answered by laps. I wondered if children know that their mothers hold a bass line of terror under all the melody. I smiled a smile that my mother would recognise as the smile I used when I had lied about washing my hands. I told myself I would have news by the time I took the mic off my collar and put my boots back on. I told myself that life can be both kind and late. I told myself a story in which a sugar arch breaks and a girl does not.By the time they asked us to stand in a tidy half-circle, the cold had laced itself up my calves and my smile had found that careful shape I use for other people\u2019s cameras. The tent hummed with the relief of ovens exhaling and bowls stacked in forgiveness. We were five across, ribbons and mends and heroics disguised as piping. Zadie did her bit about journeys and redemption arcs with the light touch of a person who knows a story only makes sense when food is involved. I kept my eyes on the white seam where the floor runner met the mat and pretended I was checking for trip hazards instead of trying not to guess what my child\u2019s feet were doing in a school corridor or on a pavement, city-wet and lit by the kind of winter noon that never commits to being day.\n\nThey did that thing where the hosts prolong a sentence because time is a toy in here. Parfait Hair arranged his mouth to look like good news and bad wisdom. Mireille stood with her hands in a way that said she had already made the decision and would be fair to you about it even if the decision hurt. \u201cIn third,\u201d they said, and the name that wasn\u2019t mine flared and softened, applause doing what it does when relief and charity marry. \u201cIn second,\u201d they said, and a heart near me unclenched, and I realised it was one of mine, the one that does logistics. When Zadie smiled at me with a kind of glee I recognised from a hundred kitchen victories and somebody squeezed my shoulder with a hand that smelled faintly of hazelnut paste, the noise in the tent was both an explosion and contained. They said my name as if I\u2019d been that word all along. A ribbon of something ran through me that tasted like electricity and saffron milk.\n\nFaces came at me fast, congratulation a weather system you can\u2019t hold off with an umbrella. The cake stand they put in my hands was heavier than I\u2019d expected, which felt right. My boots were under the bench behaving like props and obligations. Confetti that wasn\u2019t confetti drifted, crumbs of something that had been snapped for a close-up. I wanted to grin like an idiot because I had made a thing with my hands and it had not fallen and people who have eaten a great deal of cake said it was good. I also wanted to walk directly through the canvas and keep walking until I could see my child\u2019s breath on cold air and hear her say, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d in the tone that means she hasn\u2019t learned yet that the word fine is a bandage, not a cure.\n\nSomeone handed me a bouquet as if flowers are the correct translation for a woman\u2019s effort. I took them because manners are stitched into me like bias binding. A cheer went up that I would never trust in a street but did here because bunting asked me to. I found Zoe\u2019s face in the crowd and searched it like a sign. She gave me the smallest nod a person can give without their head falling off, which meant nothing immediate had happened and also that something had. The bass line of terror I have carried since pregnancy hiccuped and then kept time. I let them mic me for the bit where you say something about what it means. I said words that sounded like the inside of the tent and not like my kitchen; I said Mum and Wembley and Ava, and the nation was meant to feel something warm. In the space in my tongue I didn\u2019t use, I repeated a small prayer I learned from listening to two religions and a football commentary.\n\nAfter, they wanted shots of me pretending to walk in fresh and me holding the cake stand like a baby again and me laughing with a cousin I don\u2019t have. The crew does kindness as choreography: they kept the cameras at a polite distance while everyone touched my arm as if I might vanish. Mira hugged me and said, \u201cYou absolute beast,\u201d into my hair. Len told me he would have bet money and then shook his head as if gambling on joy is rude. The hosts did a bit about the trophy being harder to bake than a souffl\u00e9 and I made a noise like agreement because there\u2019s a timber to a day like this where you can\u2019t afford to be a bad instrument.\n\nWhen they let me go to a corner and breathe for twenty-two seconds, I took my phone back from Zoe and saw nothing from Ava, no tiny cartoon rectangles that could have been any combination of reassurance and sarcasm. Mrs. Devlin had texted me three times in her punctuation-free abandon: LILA LOVE did not see HER YET LIFT MAN SAYS SAW TWO GIRLS WITH BAGS ON THE STAIRS LAUGHING I SHOUTED NOT TO RUN. Then: MADE HER BISCUITS IN CASE. Then: DO NOT WORRY DOES NOTHING BUT AGE YOU. Mr. Patel had sent a voice note I couldn\u2019t make out in the noise; it probably contained both advice about saffron and an instruction to check the bus stop opposite the off-license where the drivers wink when it rains.\n\nMy mother had called twice and hung up before voicemail because she cannot bear the idea of her voice in a machine that will not argue back. A message from the deputy head was patient and contained the phrase \u201cno further information as yet,\u201d which is the kind of sentence that makes me want to punch clouds. A number I didn\u2019t recognise had sent a single photo of two trainers at the top of the shopping centre car park stairs, one with a ripped lace. The caption said, Is this your girl's? and then, sorry maybe not, hard to tell from shoes. I stared at it until the trainers dissolved into two halves of a thing that is not a person.\n\n\u201cLila,\u201d Zoe said, soft in the way you use for doors that slam if you push them too hard. \u201cThey want a sit-down with you and the judge. Ten minutes. Then we can get you out of here. I\u2019ve got a car on hold that goes wherever you tell it to. We\u2019ve pinged a runner to your place to look for a note because your brain is in more than one place and that is allowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say while sitting,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put my face together without glue. Ten sounds like the right shape for a thing I can do.\u201d\n\nIn the interview corner with the bunting making an effort behind me and the cake stand placed so that it was in shot but not blocking the good light, Mireille sat opposite like a woman who has seen too many people mistake sugar for truth. Her hands were the kind you trust to take a piece from your plate and not steal anything else. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said with the calm of someone who knows the currency of the word and does not overspend. \u201cYou kept balance. You did not let your story make your cake lazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, keeping my back where Staff would approve. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it. The way a thing can be both the most important thing and not at all.\u201d\n\nShe watched me the way you watch a saucepan that might boil and might not. \u201cThey told me,\u201d she said, her accent turning told into two syllables like a gift, \u201cabout your daughter walking out of school. I am not a mother. I am an aunt twelve times. My sister says her heart has one job when it is not doing the other jobs. It makes dread into a rhythm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heart has been a drummer for months,\u201d I said. \u201cSometimes it feels like it\u2019s showing off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be quick,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you will go and you will either find her standing with a face that says she wants to be told off and held at the same time, or you will find that she has been in a place where phones do not reach. Either way you will make dal that is either simple or full of too many things and you will both eat it.\u201d\n\nShe asked me then a question about saffron and signals and I answered in my public voice, which is a low-key version of my real one. We skated over the bit where being seen as a soldier in a kitchen makes people talk to you like you might explode. We laughed at a joke about bunting. We did ten minutes and then the sound engineer unhooked me with the gentleness of someone taking a tag off new clothes.\n\nOutside, the daylight was that tinny colour that makes you doubt whether the sun has a say. The car they\u2019d put me into smelled like someone else\u2019s mint. The driver asked for an address and I said, \u201cWe will do a loop,\u201d and gave him a map made of feelings. We tried the shopping centre roof, where the wind has opinions and the kids look out at a view that tricks you into thinking it is a horizon and not a collection of car parks. A security guard with a badge that claimed he was Leonard but a face that said he\u2019d answer to anything shook his head kindly. \u201cSaw two girls earlier,\u201d he said, stowing his hands in his jacket like tools. \u201cLaughing in the way you remember. One had those fancy plaits that aren\u2019t for PE. They went down the stairs when I did the voice. The voice works on the small ones. The bigger ones need something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe voice hardly works on mine,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you. If you see her, tell her her mother is doing the Voice with extra reverb.\u201d\n\nHe grinned as if he believed he might be in a story now. We did the footbridge that looks like a place spies rendezvous in films with a lower budget. We did the bus stops where the gum has a sociology degree. We did Barham Park where the geese had called a second meeting and were voting on socialism. I texted Rani\u2019s mum again and she texted back a photo of her own kitchen where six girls have spent the last month eating toast like they were being paid and a note that said, Not since lunch, I promise, I would not lie about this if she was under the table.\n\nThe runner Zoe had sent called as we rolled past the arches of the stadium in a light that made it self-conscious. \u201cI\u2019m in your kitchen,\u201d she said, apologetic and brisk. \u201cYou have a very characterful drawer. There is a note under the pigeon magnet. It says, Mum\u2014went to draw\u2014don\u2019t be mad\u2014phone 3%. Back for tea. X.\u201d She read the address as if it were one she\u2019d memorised for a game: the little wall by the canal path near where the river pretends it is still a river and a girl can pretend the city is not a machine.\n\n\u201cOf course she went to draw,\u201d I said to the car ceiling because it was the only surface I could look at that did not make me throttle myself. \u201cOf course she went to find an arch I cannot touch.\u201d\n\nThe stretch by the canal is a sly strip of water that insists on being a story even while shopping trolleys lean in it at angles. In winter the willows fuss and the joggers suffer it and the foxes do their rounds like landlords. We found her where the note said, which made me want to be angry and made me a little proud, because this is how you teach a person that you can be trusted: you tell them, and then you are where you said you would be.\n\nShe was sitting on the little wall with her knees up, trainer laces properly tied because however much she tries to be a revolutionary she has my mother in her bones. Her hood was up against a mist that wasn\u2019t really rain. A sketchbook sprawled on her lap like something asleep. Her phone lay face down next to her in that posture of dead batteries. She was not crying. She was making a face at the arch in the distance like the arch had a personality and it was showing off.\n\nI didn\u2019t call her name like a siren. I walked the last ten steps quietly the way you approach an animal that will come if you do not announce you want it to. When she felt me, her shoulders did the exact thing mine do when someone you love puts a hand there. It is a sort of dropping that still holds you upright. She didn\u2019t turn right away, which in my head will always be the split second where I am both saved and not. Then she turned, slow as a person waking up on a sofa when the film credits are already rolling.\n\n\u201cMum,\u201d she said, and the word was teenage and infant and a new country\u2019s anthem. \u201cDon\u2019t be, like\u2014mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have just been on television,\u201d I said, sitting down next to her because my legs had decided against standing. \u201cThere is nothing left in me that isn\u2019t already using its hands to stay upright.\u201d\n\nShe looked at my face closely in the way children do before they decide which mood they\u2019re dealing with. \u201cDid you win,\u201d she asked, casual as a movie star ordering fries.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d I said, and the words were heavy with a glitter I had not yet accounted for. \u201cI did, and then I did not know where you were.\u201d\n\nHer mouth moved like she was rearranging words into an apology and a defence. \u201cI left a note,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI know I should have asked. But they would have said no because it\u2019s school, and Mr. Hampton\u2019s slideshow gave me that feeling. The one where you have to get air, except not just air, like\u2014air that knows your name. And I wanted to draw it when it doesn\u2019t feel like a stadium. When it feels like a spaceship that might go if you are nice to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAir is a resource,\u201d I said, which is the kind of sentence you should never say to a child, so I stopped and tried again. \u201cYou made me scared. You made other people get in cars and look for you. You made a deputy head say phrases she has saved for special occasions. You made Mrs. Devlin put lipstick on to sit by the lift in case you came by. And you came here and made a drawing that will be better with a biscuit.\u201d\n\nHer eyes flicked up and then down with the speed of a guilt-bird. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you were in your zone. I thought telly people would look after you and you wouldn\u2019t notice I wasn\u2019t in my small zone. I\u2019m sorry. I am. I didn\u2019t think you would be\u2014like\u2014counting breaths.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is my whole hobby,\u201d I said. \u201cI count breaths like other people collect stamps. Show me your drawing.\u201d\n\nShe unfolded the book like paper wanted to be kind. The arch on the page was not perfect; it was better. It had a tiny crack in it, a deliberate scar along one curve where she had pressed harder because a bus had gone by and her elbow had gone with it. She had drawn the bunting from memory in the negative space, which is something I could not have thought to do. There was a fox in the corner with a crown that looked borrowed from a biscuit tin. There were two pairs of boots by a radiator if you looked long enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good,\u201d I said, which is never enough and always true. \u201cI thought you might be on the shopping centre roof being an existentialist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did that last week,\u201d she said, deadpan. \u201cMum. You\u2019re actually not cross?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m furious and grateful,\u201d I said. \u201cThey are two arms of the same person. You will come back with me. You will let Mrs. Devlin tell you about the time her son moved to America in a van and you will act impressed. You will call the deputy head and say the words whose letters spell out accountability. You will eat dal that is simple because I do not have the energy to put in all the things. And later I will decide what punishment looks like, which will probably be boring, like chores and a talk about trust that we will both survive.\u201d\n\nShe nodded like this was both fair and theatrical. \u201cI can do that,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you going to cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cried at saffron earlier,\u201d I said. \u201cI am an indiscriminate hydrant. Also, I burnt my finger in the name of art and I want it to have been for something.\u201d\n\nShe bumped me with a shoulder like a punctuation mark. \u201cIt was for a thing,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cIt was for Winning Baking Television.\u201d\n\nWe sat for a few minutes with the water doing its cheap impression of a river and the stadium looking like a promise you could move in under. A man on a bike with a milk crate strapped to the front passed and nodded as if we were on his route and must be acknowledged. A bus hissed somewhere in a way that always sounds like displeasure. The fox we had both been expecting sauntered into view, sniffed our toes with the intimacy of a relative, and moved on because we had no sandwiches and nothing interesting to gossip.\n\nOn the way back, the car\u2019s heater did the tiny miracle it does when it turns your fingers back into animals that can manipulate zips. Ava flicked her dead phone on and off like a ritual and declared it \u201ctraumatic.\u201d I texted Zoe a single sentence that turned my inside into a report: Found her at canal, alive, sorry, thank you. She replied with a heart and the dangerous sentence, We have time for a last shot if you want it, which I read and did not resent. Life doing its overlap will always look like audacity from some angles.\n\nAt the flat, the runner on my sofa sprang up as if I were an inspector. She had washed a mug and put it upside down to dry and I wanted to give her an award. The note sat under the pigeon magnet looking innocent. Mrs. Devlin was in the hallway holding a tin like it was a bible and wearing a cardigan that had seen things. \u201cFound her,\u201d she announced to the building as if she were parliament. \u201cI told all of you and none of you and you\u2019re welcome. Ava, come here and accept the judgement of the block, which is to say a biscuit and a two-minute talk on respect.\u201d\n\nAva folded herself into Mrs. Devlin\u2019s one-arm hug and came away dusted with sugar and stories. Mr. Patel\u2019s voice note, when I finally played it, was a minute of musings on whether saffron should be warmed by candle to keep it humble, punctuated by, I heard something, do not worry, the city is at its nicest when it is pretending to be difficult. Becks texted a photo of the range at the drill hall covered in my muffins with the caption, Stop crying or I\u2019ll make you do sixty, and another that was just, Proud of you, idiot, with a heart that looked like it had gone to a boot camp.\n\nThe deputy head picked up on the first ring and did that professional lowering of tone that makes you want to pass an exam. \u201cShe is home,\u201d I said, and she exhaled as if she had been holding air at a polite volume. We did the apologies; they were good ones, full of nouns. We made a plan involving detentions that do not break a child but make her consider the usefulness of chairs. I promised to talk to Ava not like a judge but like a woman with groceries. She told me she liked my semifinal and then pretended she had not said it, as if praise might be confiscated.\n\nZoe wanted one more shot of us on the stairs, the little domestic theatre where a mother\u2019s boots sit and a child\u2019s trainers tell on her. We did it because the day was already a mosaic and one more tile wouldn\u2019t kill us. Ava managed not to pull a face at the lens and to tuck her hair behind her ear in a way that I knew meant she felt beautiful and did not want to admit it. I put the cake stand on the table with its scorch marks and it looked right there, not on the plinth in the tent with light thinking it could be the sun. They filmed me washing my hands and drying them on the tea towel and I felt like a person who can choose what parts of herself to lend and what to keep at home with the socks that don\u2019t match.\n\nWhen they left, when the door shut and the block returned to its default settings of kids on scooters and someone\u2019s telly arguing with the sky, I stood with my palms flat on the laminate and let the ordinary come back in like a tide. The sugar arch we had not transported lay on the sideboard with its ribbon like a bandage that decided to stay on because it looked good. Ava put her drawing beside it and the two arches regarded each other with the kind of respect only two things with spines have. I made dal that was simple and I burnt the first tempering because I was not watching, and there are worse sins.\n\nOver bowls, Ava asked me what the judges said and I told her the bit about balance and the bit about not letting my story make my cake lazy, and she said, \u201cInteresting,\u201d with more sincerity than sarcasm. We ate in the kind of silence that is friendship and then we started talking at the same time and then we both said, \u201cNo, you,\u201d like a game, which is disgusting and I hope we never stop. Later, when she had done her ten minutes of detention work at the kitchen table in advance because she likes to pretend she\u2019s a lawyer pre-pleading, she went to her room humming something that might be the theme tune of a show I have never watched on purpose. I sat with the list I had written the night before\u2014ingredients and spells\u2014and added a line: Do not make the arch hold what it cannot. Teach it to share.\n\nThe phone rang, and this time it was Marcus with that triumphant tone of a man who has emerged from a meeting with his own name still attached. \u201cHeard the good news,\u201d he said without a hello, because he thinks entrances are for other people. \u201cMy boss\u2019s wife watches; I am a man of the people. Congratulations, Lila. Our girl okay? I had a missed call.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe decided to redefine lunch,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s home. She left a note and her phone died and I had to invent six new heartbeats. She will call you later and pretend it\u2019s all very normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirteen,\u201d he said, as if it were a diagnosis. \u201cI\u2019ll come down this weekend, yeah? Take her to the one with the pancakes. Watch her roll her eyes at me about everything from napkins to the existence of napkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be good,\u201d I said, because I am not cruel and because Ava loves him with a caveat and that caveat is not for anyone else to hold. \u201cAnd thanks.\u201d\n\nHe went into a bit about Manchester and cranes on the skyline and I let the words pass like traffic, nodding in the right places because this is a street we have driven down many times. When I hung up, the kitchen made that little settling sound it has when it\u2019s happy to be the place everything comes back to. I put the cake stand on the top of the fridge because that\u2019s where we keep things that mean something in case meaning can climb.\n\nThat night the muscle memory of show days kept me awake, the body unable to accept that it no longer needed to prove anything to ovens. I got up and wrote in my notebook about the way Mireille had said balance and how that word could be a plank and a scale and a trick on a wire. I added a line about breath counting and who taught me it and how many times my shoulders needed instruction before they learned their proper place. I drew a fox with a crown in the margin like I was twelve again and hoping a teacher would see it and decide I was interesting.\n\nIn the morning the estate had its hungover Monday voice. The lift did its sigh like an old auntie. The bus brake hissed. Mrs. Devlin\u2019s radio told a horse to be good. Mr. Patel put the shutters up like a reveal. The stadium glinted as if it had been polished in the night by some patient giant. I laced my boots with the kind of care that is not anxiety but religion, and I put on my old service tee because it is soft and because sometimes you wear clothes that remind you that you have belonged to places that don\u2019t care what you bake.\n\nAva came out in a skirt she had not asked me about and a hoodie she had absolutely promised not to wear to school and did an about-turn when she saw my eyebrows. \u201cDetention today,\u201d she said, pre-emptively noble. \u201cI will be the picture of remorse in a room with a poster about adverbs. I will text you when I am sitting down in a chair and when I am standing up from the chair and when I have been released back into the general population.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will attempt to behave as if I do not require this level of detail,\u201d I said. \u201cI will fail. I will still function.\u201d\n\nShe kissed my cheek in that rapid way you do when you hope the affection outruns the embarrassment. \u201cProud of you,\u201d she said into my skin, and I would have baked a city for that. \u201cAnd also: the arch is better with the ribbon. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said that. They\u2019ll make me talk about metaphor in English.\u201d\n\nI let her go because parenting is, in the end, a practice in deliberate letting go with a hand ready just off-screen. When the door shut, the flat looked like a stage after a play has ended, props in their places, the smell of warm light lingering. I sat down with the list of things that come after a victory you don\u2019t yet have a box for: the press thing that might be nothing and might be a morning spent eating small pastries in a room where people talk too fast; the drill hall evening where Becks will make me run in a circle for reasons that will be explained and none of them will be good; the conversation with Mum about lipstick and hair and the way she will tell my auntie that I am on the telly and also that I am thin since last month and I must eat.\n\nI washed the sugar off the sideboard with hot water and the smell pulled the previous day back in like a tide. I thought about the way the producer had asked for a prop and how the boots had looked under that bench, patient and ridiculous. I thought about Mr. Patel saying the final is just the beginning and how sometimes beginnings look exactly like your kitchen with a tiny leak under the sink and a child who has wandered off and returned with a drawing that is better than the real thing. I thought about how, on Salisbury Plain, Staff used to stop us in the rain and tell us to put our shoulders down, like a spell, like a blessing, like a grammar for bodies that had forgotten their own syntax.\n\nWhen the post came through the door with its slap of inevitability, there was an envelope with the show\u2019s logo and a letter about the \u201cculmination\u201d of journeys and three vouchers for a kitchenware brand that thinks you have a second kitchen for display. There was also a leaflet for a youth thing at the temple, with a photo of a girl who was not my daughter but could have been. I stuck it on the fridge with the pigeon magnet and a bit of ribbon that had been holding an arch together and looked at the collage. Boots. Magnet. Ribbon. A girl\u2019s handwriting that said don\u2019t be mad. A city that insists on being arched. I breathed, which is a thing I am learning to do like a craft. I put saffron in milk to see if it would tell me something new. I let the morning happen without adding too much to it. I thought, today I will not be a story for anyone who isn\u2019t in this room.\n\nAt mid-morning, the drill hall text thread blew up with Becks\u2019s brand of affection disguised as orders. Parade square, 1800, bring your ridiculous trophy so I can fill it with Lucozade and tradition. Someone had photoshopped my face onto a queen with a piping bag scepter and the caption, All Hail, which made me snort and saved me from the quieter, heavier tears that keep appointments you didn\u2019t set. I sent a photo of the arch with its ribbon and captioned it: I did a mend. Becks replied, Picture of my ankle taped in 2012. Mends keep you in the game.\n\nA bell in the courtyard did its uncertain ring and I remembered the first bell of Ava\u2019s school, how it used to make me feel like a teenage version of myself was doing sit-ups in the attic. I made a tray of biscuits I could drop at Mrs. Devlin\u2019s because she likes to say she\u2019s not fussed and then be fussed in a way that keeps the building from becoming merely a structure. While they baked, I called Mum to let her do the thing where she pretends to criticise my choices to protect me from anyone else doing it.\n\n\u201cYour face on the telly,\u201d she said by way of greeting, like she had been waiting at a window. \u201cLike a peach. Like a paneer cut fresh. Did you wear the dusky lipstick. It was good, see, because then your eyes were not fighting your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cMum,\u201d I said, resting my chin on my wrist because some parts of me are twelve forever. \u201cIt happened. The winning. And her. The absence that filled the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI called on God and also on Mrs. Gupta,\u201d she said, the hierarchy clear to her and not to me. \u201cBetween them they can move a bus. She is thirteen. Thirteen is an age I would like to put in a cupboard for a year and then take out when it has finished with its dramas. You did not tell me you were scared when you were thirteen. You were quiet as a rice pot on a low flame. I did not know if you were cooking or sulking. She will tell you, and then she will run to avoid the echo of her own words.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe left a note,\u201d I said. \u201cI keep thinking this means we are doing at least one thing right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means you have built a house where notes make sense,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a great achievement. Bigger than your cake with the thing on top that looked like a bridge and a weapon. Come for lunch. I will make you fish because you forget you are a person with bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring Mrs. Devlin because she has been the building today.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring her,\u201d Mum said. \u201cI will not let her drink too much tea because she gets fast.\u201d\n\nI hung up and leaned on the counter in the way that means you have asked gravity to do some work for you. The biscuits made their tinny clatter onto the cooling rack. A van outside shouted something about fresh carpets. A child screamed the scream that means someone has denied him a second biscuit with totalitarian ferocity. The day had returned to its usual angle, which is to say slightly off, slightly galling, mostly fine.\n\nWhen Ava came home she did the penitent swagger that exists in all school corridors. She held a little green slip that said Detention Completed, which might be my favourite phrase I have ever read. She put it on the fridge with the pigeon magnet because she understands the archive of our lives. We took the biscuits upstairs to Mrs. Devlin and listened to the horse race and placed our bets on the names that sounded like aunties. We lost, because the universe prefers it when you do. We went to Mum\u2019s and did the jam between three generations thing where love turns into instructions and instructions turn into jokes and jokes turn into washing up. I let them talk about me as if I wasn\u2019t in the room, which is an art and a relief.\n\nLater, when it was dark and cold with that careful London reluctance to be dramatic, I walked to the drill hall with the trophy hidden under a shopping bag because I am allergic to being robbed of symbols. The hall smelled like oil and men who plan to get better at something and tea that rescues more lives than it is credited with. Becks saluted me in a way that would get us both told off and then pulled me into a hug that squared my shoulders for me. The lads cheered in a way that was ninety percent sincere and ten percent hoping I\u2019d bring biscuits again. I did the speech they made me do which was three sentences longer than it needed to be because you have to give them something to mock later. I told them I had patched a sugar arch with ribbon and a plan and I had won anyway, and one of the new recruits who had the eyes of a deer and the stance of a man who would one day own his skin said, \u201cIs that allowed,\u201d and Becks, from behind me, shouted, \u201cIt is when you\u2019re Rahman,\u201d as if my name were a certificate.\n\nOn the way home I walked past the stadium because I always do when there is something in me that needs explaining to itself. It was lit in a blue that tries to be expensive and often succeeds. The arch made its shape in a sky that was not ready for it. A fox came down the steps of a terrace like he\u2019d paid the mortgage and I bowed to him because I am not too proud to respect monarchy in forms that suit me. I thought about how many arches a day you walk under without noticing them, the ones made by your gait and your kitchen taps and the curve of the shoulder you sleep on. I thought about how show days are like judgements you survive, and real days are like training you come back for on purpose.\n\nAt the flat, Ava had done her homework and then drawn the bus braking the way she likes to, with speed lines and a faint halo. She had written Home in a way that wasn\u2019t a title so much as an instruction. I put the trophy on the table with the scorch marks and put the ribbon next to it and put the pigeon magnet in my pocket because the pigeon has done enough. Then I went to bed and told my brain in the voice of Staff that the day was over and the next day would arrive whether I practised or not. I slept in slices, as mothers do, and dreamed that sugar remembered me and did not hold a grudge. In the morning, the leak under the sink still asked for a bowl and the geese still had opinions and the dough still knew when I was tense and the rifle did too and I was, against my expectations, still a person who could hold all of that in one pair of hands.Chapter Six\n\nThe week after the tent felt like waking from a dream and finding you had brought a prop back with you. I kept catching sight of the cake stand on the top of the fridge and thinking it was a bowl I had left out of place, then remembering it was a symbol. Symbols make poor mixing bowls. They don\u2019t take kindly to being filled with batter. The embargo email from production came with congratulations wrapped in legalese, a smile with a hand firmly over its own mouth. We are thrilled you are thrilled, it said, and also please zip the feeling up until the broadcast, no exceptions, even if your aunties bully you. It listed fines that had too many zeros to seem real and a schedule of possible pick-up days for filming extra shots of me whisking as if I had only just discovered the concept.\n\nIt is one thing to keep news from strangers. It is another to look Mr. Patel in the eye when he says, \u201cSo, are we to rejoice or to wait,\u201d and say, \u201cWe are to wait.\u201d He did a little theatre of not caring and slid a mango into my bag with the secret handshake speed of a man who has accomplices everywhere. Mrs. Devlin did not believe in embargoes. She took me by the elbow by the lift and said, \u201cIs it you, is it, is it,\u201d with such intensity that I had to say, \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d and then she narrowed one eye like a pigeon and nodded as if I had confessed to stealing a horse.\n\nAva did her detention in a room with a poster of a mountain telling her the journey was the thing, and came home with a new gravity she wore for an hour and then misplaced because the cartoon on at six made her laugh in a way that loosened the screws on a day. The deputy head called me in for a chat with a tone that implied tea and consequences. We sat in her office with two chairs that made polite noises when you moved and a plant that had survived against the odds, which I respected. Ava did the apologies in the sentences we practised, the ones with nouns. She put her shoulders down when I gave her the look we have developed for such things. Mr. Hampton turned up halfway through on an errand for a stapler and ended up praising the drawing in a way that made Ava\u2019s mouth try not to be pleased and fail. \u201cIt\u2019s got the charm of a map,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be charming,\u201d and he said, \u201cGood,\u201d because he is a man who will pet awkward children like cats until they purr.\n\nThey mentioned a school exhibition of student work in two weeks, parents invited if they behave. I said I would come and clap quietly. On the way out, a mother I know by sight as someone who does everything competently and has strong views on leggings asked if I was the one who kept turning up in that \u201cmilitary business.\u201d Her smile was friendly enough to be dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s so brave of you,\u201d she said in a tone that made brave sound like a hobby. \u201cAnd distracting,\u201d she added, flicking her eyes towards Ava as if children are kites that get away in wind. I told my shoulders to stay where they were and said that lots of jobs are brave if you tilt your head, childcare, neurosurgery, the night shift at the corner shop after a match. She nodded as if I had said something philosophical and went away to be brave about gluten.\n\nMarcus arrived on Saturday in a coat that had an opinion and shoes that had never met a puddle. He brought a bag from a shop that sells candles at a price that would make my mother lie down, and inside was a jumper for Ava with sequins that fell off like confetti if you breathed near them. He did that thing where he looks around my kitchen like it is a set and then remembers he used to live in rooms like this and makes his face do humility. He kissed the top of Ava\u2019s head and she tolerated it for exactly as long as it took him to say \u201ckiddo,\u201d at which point she wrinkled her nose and said, \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d and then hugged him properly because love makes fools of us.\n\nWe went to the pancake place that has decided to be American via Harrow. He ordered like a man who knows the menu and asks for extras that do not make sense here. He wanted to know everything and also wanted to be told he was knowing everything very well. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me when there\u2019s press,\u201d he said, eyes bright with the thought of being useful. \u201cI could talk to someone. Make sure they know you\u2019re more than the Army angle. Maybe get you a piece in that thing my mate\u2019s wife reads, the Sunday supplement with the plants.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not at the press bit yet,\u201d I said, cutting a pancake the size of a plate into squares like currency. \u201cAnd it will be a small thing in a big paper. Nobody wants to know about saffron except the five of us who have already made up our minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will,\u201d he said, in the voice he uses when he\u2019s pitching a scheme to men called Arjun who own bits of Manchester. \u201cYou\u2019re watchable. You\u2019re grounded. It\u2019s very now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow is a short window,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building the Taj Mahal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt took twenty years,\u201d he said, missing the point with the grace of a trained man. He asked about Marcus\u2019s world, and I let him tell me about cranes that mean money and how you can tell a city is moving by the number of coffee shops in a half-mile. He did not know that we measure a city by the number of aunties per block, but I did not hold it against him. He paid, not making a show of it for once, and the waitress called him \u201cbabe\u201d with such effortless familiarity that I almost clapped.\n\nHe came with us to Mum\u2019s later, stood in the kitchen with the photo of my father above the spice jars and did his respectful act with real heart. Mum fed him and he made the appreciative noises that unlock more food. She asked him if his mother was well and he lied politely and she pretended not to hear. When the aunties turned up with their eyebrows already at half-mast, he held his shape. He did not stay for the temple youth thing because football, because a mate, because the train back would be crowded with people whose voices exhaust him. Ava said she understood and she did and she didn\u2019t, because thirteen is the age where understanding is a coat you can take off when convenient. When he left, he hugged me like a man who doesn\u2019t want to admit he is apologising for something you haven\u2019t accused him of yet. \u201cYou tell me if you need anything,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cI need a reliable tap,\u201d and he laughed because he thought it was a joke.\n\nAt the temple, they put me in a line of women who have done something in the community and gave us plates that groaned under kindness. Auntie Rupa told me in stage whispers what each judge likes to eat, as if she had once dated them and was willing to share intel. The kids did a song with hand gestures and the drummer missed his cue in a way that made you love him harder. A teenager in a hoodie with a halo of hair did a spoken word piece about the city being made of mouths and it made everyone look at their own hands as if they had been caught stealing. I donated two saffron cakes and the first one went privately in the back room to the committee because committee duties require sustenance, and the second was cut into squares so small you could taste them only if you were patient. Mr. Patel was there with a bag that looked like it had been packed by a magician. He pulled out a tiny jar of saffron and put it in my palm like contraband. \u201cFor the day you decide to be greedy,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cTomorrow,\u201d and he laughed like a clock.\n\nOn Monday the sky did the flat tin thing it does when even the clouds can\u2019t be bothered to be dramatic. Becks rang me mid-morning with wind in her voice. \u201cPack a bag,\u201d she said, no hello, all weather. \u201cMACA. Yorkshire. Three nights, maybe four. Flooding and the council\u2019s lost the plot. We\u2019re on rotation with Barnet and the Medics. You\u2019ve got a job with your name on it and it involves getting soggy.\u201d\n\nI looked at the cake stand and it looked back with the nonchalance of an object that has never seen a sandbag. \u201cWhen,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d she said. \u201cRVs at 1900. You can say no if you\u2019ve got a reason that includes blood, death, other children, or court. Not telly. I will come round and drag you by your sensible plait if you say telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d I said, because there are parts of me that only light up when everyone else\u2019s coats are already wet. \u201cI\u2019ll get Ava to Mum\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and then softened. \u201cYou alright? You\u2019re thin in the voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, and she said my name in the way that means I should try to think of a better adjective and I failed. \u201cI\u2019ll bring biscuits,\u201d I added, because bribes are ancient and effective.\n\nZoe took it well when I told her I might miss a pick-up day. \u201cReal life has better lighting anyway,\u201d she said, and asked me to send her a ten-second video for socials of my boots stepping into something as if it were poetry. I said no because I am an adult and have limits. She pretended to be sad and wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019ll find another day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not making news, we\u2019re making telly. Your flooded county can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nPacking for floods is a ritual made of lists you wish you didn\u2019t have. Thermal leggings that refuse to die. Socks that have opinions. Gloves that have forgiven you for last time. A small tin of cardamom, because I am not a savage and tea matters. Ava watched me line up kit on the bed with the attention of a girl who is making her list of future selves. \u201cYou\u2019ll text every time you\u2019re inside,\u201d she said, hands in her hoodie like a prayer. \u201cAnd every time you\u2019re outside. And you will come back with all your toes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll toes,\u201d I said. \u201cLeft foot attitude, right foot nuance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if Dad calls,\u201d she said, like she was testing an alarm. \u201cWhat should I tell him.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him the truth,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried the other thing. It doesn\u2019t stick.\u201d\n\nMum took her in with the speed of a woman who has a spare bed and a spare plan always in the cupboard. \u201cBring her sketchbook,\u201d she said on the phone. \u201cI\u2019ve got that youth thing still, and she can sit in the corner and pretend to hate it while she draws aunties with their mouths open.\u201d We carried a bag down the stairs and Mrs. Devlin leaned out in an apron that said Kiss the Cook and the cook had lipstick on her cheek. \u201cHeroism again,\u201d she said, not a question. \u201cBring back a story that does not involve a weir. Those make me nervous.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d I said. \u201cThere will be sandbags, I promise. They\u2019re safer narratively.\u201d\n\nNight in a coach with bodies and rucksacks and the smell of ambition and damp. The window showed a road that kept arguing with fog. The guy across the aisle snored in the exact rhythm of a drum kit being tested. Becks made faces in the reflection until I laughed and got shushed by a corporal who was three years my junior and as old as a cave. We arrived at a leisure centre with a floor that had seen more Zumba than war, and did the thing you do where you make a place yours with tape, kettle, and a pile of dignity. The coordinator met us with a clipboard and the posture of a man whose house is three inches shorter than it was yesterday. \u201cBless you,\u201d he said, which is the kind of sentence I file under Not Useful But Sweet.\n\nThe next days were wet in a biblical but very British way. We lifted strangers\u2019 sofas onto paint tins and told them it helped because it helps a little to be told you have done something. We laid sandbags with hands that started out believing themselves to be strong and found out what strong means when your elbows disagree. We made tea in mugs with the names of football teams on them and the sugar went down like medication. We walked along a river that had decided to meet the road and not introduce itself first, and guided pensioners across with jokes we keep for such bridges. I stood in a living room where a wedding photo worn to softness watched us and thought about the sugar arch in my kitchen and the way I had had the nerve to think that was a problem.\n\nThere was a house with a woman who had a baby and the baby had a cough that made me want to go and fetch a doctor on my back. She kept apologising for the state of her floor and I kept telling her that floors don\u2019t have feelings. We found the stopcock like heroes and turned the water off like a magic trick for a three-year-old. When we had to move her chest of drawers we found under it a photograph of a girl in a school uniform with a tie like a melted snake, and the woman took it and held it as if it could absorb water. \u201cShe\u2019s at her dad\u2019s,\u201d she said, like she did not believe in the sentence yet. I told her to put the photo in a book and put the book somewhere high. I did not tell her to call him because that is not my business and also because my advice is often a wish in costume.\n\nAt night in the leisure centre people snored like orchestras and whispered like shows. The hall smelled of feet and triumph. Becks lived on crisps. I lay on a mat with my boots close enough to touch and texted Mum in the long grammar of check-ins. Ava sent photos of my mother\u2019s curries labelled by emoji. She sent me a picture of the arch she had drawn again, this time with rain on it that she had made with dots so neat it looked like a type of music. Rani\u2019s mum sent me a photo of the girls on her floor with juice cartons making a battlement. I sent back a picture of a sandbag with a smiley face someone had drawn on it with a marker because people will make faces on anything so they can talk to it.\n\nWe came back on a Thursday, mud in every seam, the coach thick with that tired cheerfulness that comes when you have been useful and no one died. The city rose up around us like a bad idea being very proud of itself. At the drill hall they let us drop our kit in a place it could smell of itself and I took my bag and ran my mind over the list of things you do to make home rehome you. The flat smelled like no one had been cooking, which hurt my pride and soothed something else. The sugar arch with the ribbon looked at me as if to say, You see, I am not the only mend. Ava came out of Mum\u2019s car a minute later in a hoodie that was not mine but felt like mine, and threw herself into my torso with a force that gave me a bruise and fixed my bones.\n\n\u201cYou smell like wet rope,\u201d she said into my sleeve, delighted and disgusted. \u201cAnd also like those blue sweets you don\u2019t let me have because you say they\u2019re made of sadness.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadness and chemicals,\u201d I said. \u201cBoth of which have their uses.\u201d I stood in my kitchen in damp socks and watched the kettle try to be a miracle. I burnt the first pan of sugar on purpose as an offering to the god of too much and laughed at myself because that is a ritual I can afford.\n\nThere was a letter on the mat from the landlord that had the wheedling tone of men who believe in statistics. It announced a rent increase with the apologetic air of a doctor holding a needle. I sat with it at the table that has seen more bills than cakes and felt the sum move around in my chest like a creature. The leak under the sink dripped into the tuppaware with a patience that felt like mockery. I called the number on the landlord\u2019s letter and it went to a voicemail that had never met a real person. I put my head in my hands and thought, What do we do to not go under, in a city that is always a centimetre from your mouth.\n\nMr. Patel saved me from turning into a spreadsheet by appearing in the doorway with a paper bag and a proposition. \u201cPop-up,\u201d he said, already halfway into my kitchen in a way that would annoy another person and makes me love him. \u201cTemple has their winter fair next Saturday. You take a table. You make something nobody else makes, which is to say everything. I will do you a deal on ingredients that will make me look generous and not actually bankrupt me. We will put a jar labelled Rent if you like, no shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a stall,\u201d I said, reaching for the bag because he had brought samosas and I am a coward. \u201cI\u2019m a person. I do not have a gazebo. I do not have the ability to smile at people who ask if there\u2019s a gluten-free option like they are asking if you have a spare kidney.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be behind a table,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be a stall. It\u2019s a hat you put on like your beret. It will fit or you will pin it. Bring the girl. She can be the sullen assistant who makes the till go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a till,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou have a biscuit tin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the same thing but more honest. Take cash. Take card if you can make your phone behave like a machine. If anyone asks for a discount, tell them your mother\u2019s slippers will visit them in the night.\u201d He put the bag on the counter and the samosas made the kitchen smell like a braver room. \u201cYou think the show is going to give you your rent? The show will give you a montage. People give you rent. People, and sometimes the Army, and sometimes your mother if she is in a mood.\u201d\n\nThere are moments when pride needs to be told to sit down and put its feet up because humility has a better head for figures. I told him yes. He nodded like a man who had set a kettle and walked away certain it would boil. \u201cSaffron,\u201d he said, tapping the counter as if to write it into the laminate. \u201cPistachio. And one thing with chocolate for the teenagers who think complexity is betrayal. Make a sign that says We Don\u2019t Do TikTok. They will come out of spite.\u201d\n\nThe next days were lists and rinses. I went to the council website to check what the rules were about selling from a home kitchen and went cross-eyed over PDFs that spoke in a smug tone about hand-washing facilities as if sinks were optional. I filled out forms while Ava did homework that involved a man named Pythagoras who had never baked a cake in his life. I scrubbed my oven like a penitent and judged the state of my own fridge with the mercilessness I reserve for institutions. I watched videos about square card readers narrated by a woman called Jess who smiled like a drug. Becks came over on a night I had not planned for talking and lay on my floor with crisps like a cat and said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a stall. You\u2019re an emporium. I demand a staff discount that is expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will pay double,\u201d I said. \u201cThe markup is called Being Mean to Me in 2016 when I couldn\u2019t march without tripping.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said, grinning with her whole face. \u201cI\u2019m coming to heckle. I will bring the lads and we will buy all the chocolate thing and leave the sophisticated ones for the aunties and your Instagram.\u201d\n\nAva designed a sign without being asked in a burst of competence that felt like the weather changing. She wrote Lila\u2019s in script like icing and then Under New Management in block capitals like a joke. She drew a tiny fox in the corner wearing a hijab because the foxes in our estate have manners. She said, \u201cYou should not price anything in round numbers. It\u2019s not professional.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is professional,\u201d I said. \u201cIn this economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cA mess with an invoice,\u201d she said, absorbed, and I stroked her hair in the way I can do only when she is not looking.\n\nThe night before the fair, we did the kind of baking that turns a room into a clock. Saffron milk in a jug translucent with gold. Pistachios blanched and rubbed until they gave up their skins like men at the end of an argument. Chocolate ganache the colour of decisions. I set up a staging area we called in our house The War and put out ribbon and dowels and string and a spare roll of bin bags as if I were planning to start a new religion. Mum came over with a bag of things I had not asked for, including napkins with roses that had the exact energy of weddings in 1992. \u201cTake,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will wipe and bless you.\u201d\n\nWe slept the kind of sleep you buy at a shop that will not refund you. In the morning, the estate was a chorus of trolley squeaks and the sound of volunteers weekending. The temple car park had sprouted a landscape of tents that made the place look like a polite army had decided to occupy in order to sell chutney. Aunties with clipboards moved at speeds that defied their sandals. Mr. Patel wore a scarf that could have been used as a banner and greeted me like a fellow general. \u201cWe will put you here,\u201d he said, plonking me in the corner where the wind had a say but the light was forgiving. \u201cYou will be opposite the man with honey and next to the lady who does macram\u00e9. Do not get tangled.\u201d\n\nWe spread our wares with the reverence of a ritual: saffron pistachio slices that shimmered faintly, chocolate buns that exhaled like sleepy dogs, a tray of cardamom biscuits stamped with patterns that made them look more important than they needed to be. Ava put the sign at the front and stood behind the table with the air of a bank teller in a village under siege. Mr. Patel produced a card reader from his pocket as if conjured and told me I owed him my firstborn. I paid him in portions of cake and debt.\n\nThe first customers were aunties in a pack who pretended to be unimpressed until their second bite. A man in a football kit asked for something not too sweet and bought two of the sweetest things as an act of rebellion. A girl of eight wearing unicorn tights argued with her grandmother about whether pistachios were nuts or green raisins. Becks arrived with two soldiers in civvies and a megaphone, which I confiscated. Mrs. Devlin appeared in a hat that had not seen light since a wedding and bought six biscuits and then came back for four because she said she had a meeting with the lift and it required energy. Mira from the tent sent a cousin with a grin and a message that my ribboned arch had made her cry, in a good way, because good ways exist.\n\nAround twelve, a woman from a local paper with a camera that had been loved more than it deserved asked if she could take a photo. She said, \u201cArmy baker,\u201d with the lilt of a headline and I felt the old impulse to argue rise like a loaf. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re doing saffron and paying rent,\u201d and she wrote it down and asked me to stand with my boots in shot and then said, \u201cBut not like war, like weather,\u201d and I liked her more than I wanted to. The photo will make me look both too tall and too tired. It will make my mother cry. It will make my auntie cut it out and put it on her fridge and wipe it with a cloth every time she remembers to wipe something else.\n\nBy two we had a queue that made me want to apologise to the world and a float of change that had become a handful of coins and a promise. Mr. Patel kept up a running commentary like a cricket match. \u201cAnd Rahman comes in again with the pistachio, a strong offering, the crowd is appreciative, ten points to honesty,\u201d he said, and a kid laughed and decided to like us. A woman with a baby asked if cardamom is bad for milk and I told her no and would she like tea. An older man bought one biscuit, ate it standing there, dove into his jacket for a tenner and took another one to his wife at a stall selling ribbons, returning for a third because he had not told his wife about the second. We sold out of chocolate by three because teenagers do not care about subtleties. We sold out of saffron by four because aunties do. We put up a small sign in Ava\u2019s blunt writing that said Sold Out, Sorry, and a girl with glitter on her cheek looked at it like it had personally betrayed her.\n\nAfter, we counted coins with the solemn joy of pirates. We put the notes in a pile and Ava slapped her hand on them like she needed to keep them from flying away. We had enough to make the rent rise less like a cliff and more like a steep step. We had enough to go to the Turkish place after and eat chips under garlicky sauce and tell each other we were bosses. We had enough to give Mr. Patel his cut and have him tell us to keep more because he is a businessman and a human in that order on weekdays and the other way round on Sundays.\n\nAt home I put the tin on the table and we looked at it like it might have its own pulse. Mum counted it again because she trusts her fingers more than mine. Noush, the girl from number fourteen who is always on the stairwell listening to the world and pretending she is waiting for someone, popped her head in and asked if we had any leftovers and I gave her two and she sank to the floor like someone had told her a happy secret. The light did that slanted thing it does when the day is kind enough to let you know it\u2019s going. The leak under the sink dripped with the leap of a metronome. The cake stand on top of the fridge glowed like a thing that had been in a tent and learned respect.\n\nThe school exhibition came and with it the particular chaos of children in rooms with their names on the wall. Parents walked around like tourists in a city where the landmarks are small and taped. Someone\u2019s little brother cried with the dignified sorrow of boys under five. Mr. Hampton wore a tie that had been ironed by a woman who loves him only on Wednesdays. Ava\u2019s drawing of the arch with the fox had a Post-it next to it with a kind comment in a hand I recognised as the deputy head\u2019s. A girl from Year Nine had drawn a pair of boots that were clearly mine because she had put the mud on them the way Salisbury puts mud on a person. A boy had filmed a video where the camera did that jittery music video thing and I got telling-off feelings even though there was nobody to tell me off. Ava stood with her hands in the pocket of her hoodie and received praise like a medicine she had to swallow without water.\n\nA mother with very bright lipstick leaned in and said, \u201cDid she draw that from a photo, or is she one of those children,\u201d and I said, \u201cOne of which,\u201d and she laughed too much. Another father said, \u201cMy wife says she saw you at the temple thing with the cakes. She said you were \u2018inspirational.\u2019 I told her that\u2019s a lot to expect from a cupcake,\u201d and he smiled to show it was a joke and I smiled back to show I understood jokes. A boy looked at Ava\u2019s fox, at the crown, at the boots by the radiator in the corner of the frame, and then at me, and his face did a calculation that made him say, \u201cYou\u2019re her mum,\u201d in a tone I can\u2019t describe because it was a sorting and a blessing and an accusation and a welcome. \u201cThe cake one,\u201d he added, to be helpful.\n\nWe got home and I put the certificate she got for \u2018Exploration Through Line\u2019 on the fridge with the pigeon magnet because certificates are magnets\u2019 natural prey. She pretended to be annoyed and then asked me for a photo of it so she could send it to Rani. She didn\u2019t ask to post it, which is a grace I will not forget for a long time.\n\nThe following week brought an email from production with a subject line that wanted to be a hug. Family package, Tuesday, it said. Footage with Mum? Drill hall? Wembley? We will be kind. They wanted to film a morning like the ones we manufacture on purpose to look like mornings. They wanted to catch the bus hissing and Mrs. Devlin\u2019s radio and Mr. Patel producing fruit with a flourish. They wanted me to lace my boots on camera again and not blink at the thought that I had turned my life into a collage of useful angles. I said yes because they would film it anyway and I\u2019d rather it be me telling the story than the story making itself.\n\nWe did it. We did the thing where a crew with nice teeth turns up and makes your kitchen look like you have won at cleaning. Mum sat at the table and said things that made Zoe cry behind her monitor. Becks came to the drill hall and let them film a minute of us not marching but standing, which is more complicated than it looks when you know people are watching. They filmed my hands tying Ava\u2019s tie and had the decency to not film the bit where we argued about whether a hoodie under a blazer is a sin. They shot the stadium from the canal path and the fox from the estate went about his business without signing a release. They put a microphone on Mr. Patel and he resisted the urge to act, which is a victory I will count as mine.\n\nAt one point, Zadie asked me, \u201cDo you ever feel like an imposter,\u201d and I said, \u201cOnly on days that end in y,\u201d and she laughed, but later on the sofa when the house was quiet in the way you buy on hire purchase, I thought about the word properly. I have worn uniforms in rooms where you are asked to prove you are not a mannequin. I have had jobs where the men around you check their watch when you speak as if your time has started costing them money. I have stirred sugar at two in the morning and wondered if I had convinced myself that paying attention is the same as being talented. I have stood in a tent with my boots under my bench and my heart in my fist and told myself it wasn\u2019t a performance. I have been a mother who is not somebody\u2019s wife in rooms where wives are the currency. Imposter is a word for a person whose centre keeps enough moving parts that there is always a noise. I am learning to call it music and let myself dance.\n\nOne evening, after the cameras had gone and I had put the tea towel back on its hook like that mattered, I found myself on the floor with a stack of letters my father wrote my mother when he was a boy pretending to be a man. She kept them in a shoebox under the bed with the shoes because, she says, it\u2019s good for paper to smell ambition. His handwriting is a landscape I have walked since I was small. He wrote about buses and the price of tomatoes and the way a man once tried to sell him a watch that didn\u2019t tick. He wrote that he thought he would be a different person at thirty-two and he was both disappointed and not. He wrote that when he thought of me he thought of a mango, not for the sweetness but for the way a mango stains your hands and stays with you.\n\nI fell asleep on the rug with a letter on my face like a mask and woke to Ava putting a blanket over me with the delicacy of a person who would like to be loved without comment. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a line in your cheek,\u201d she said, cool as a nurse. \u201cFrom the writing. It\u2019ll say something mean like stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop stopping,\u201d I said, and she rolled her eyes and kissed my forehead because this is how we forgive each other for being ridiculous.\n\nIt rained the next morning, hard and then soft, the kind of rain that makes the fox\u2019s tail look like he has seen a ghost. The bus sighed into its stop like an old man. The leak under the sink did a particularly showy drip and I swore at it in a tone my mother would claim means I am becoming an English person. I called the landlord again and left a message that was both polite and overdosed with adjectives. I put saffron in milk too early in the day and it made the house smell like a memory. The geese at the park had another meeting. One of them looked me in the eye and I swear to you we negotiated.\n\nLater, Mr. Patel rang my bell and handed me a brown envelope with the air of a man who has decided to become mysterious. \u201cA friend,\u201d he said. \u201cOf my cousin\u2019s boy who did an internship in a place that had a budget. He does a market near Kensal on Sundays with nice stalls and velvet ropes for carrots. He saw your face in the paper with the lipstick. He says he\u2019d give you a table once. A trial.\u201d He said the last word with the relish of someone pronouncing a sentence on a villain. \u201cAre you bold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am make-sure-my-child-has-shoes bold,\u201d I said. \u201cI am fix-my-leak bold. I am not velvet-rope-carrot bold.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe it,\u201d he said, and went away humming tunelessly like a kettle.\n\nThat night, I lay in bed with the fan doing that small irritating dance it does when it wants attention and listened to the building rehearse its sounds. Someone upstairs dropped cutlery and then laughed in the quick embarrassed way that people do when they remind themselves they live over other people. A boy on a bike went past and shouted a word that could be love or could be its cousin. Ava turned in her bed in the room next to mine and the sound of her changing sides was the sound that matters more than anything. I thought about the market near Kensal with carrots that deserve velvet and the drill hall with its honest oil and the tent with its impossible light, and I thought about the arch with ribbon and about how some things are better for having been repaired where you can see it.\n\nIn the morning, the email was there, as if the night had laid it like an egg. The subject line said simply: Opportunity. Inside, a man with a name like a brand said he had a slot for me at a market, one day, one table, no guarantees, only the chance to be looked at by the right eyes. He said he liked \u201cmy story,\u201d and I felt that stab of wanting to cut my story in half and hand him the piece that wouldn\u2019t bleed. He said he understood if I had commitments, if the Army had first call on my days, but that he hoped I could find a Sunday to become a stall again in a different city, slightly to the left of ours. He said he had loved the bit in the paper where my mouth did a determined thing. He said he had a tent that would not be cold.\n\nI wrote back with my grandmother\u2019s caution and my daughter\u2019s cheek. I said yes, in a way that admitted no, if the world decided to throw a flood at me again, or an arch, or a child with a drawing that needed air. I put the kettle on and the geese argued like politicians and Mrs. Devlin banged her door like a drum and Mr. Patel turned his sign to Open with the righteousness of a man who has never closed, and I stood at my window and watched the stadium blink like a ship signalling something. My boots were by the radiator doing their patient work of drying without fuss. My hands remembered sugar and sandbags and the weight of coins and a baby with a cough and my daughter\u2019s hair. I stretched my shoulders down where Staff had taught them to live, and then I rolled dough as if it could make a road, and I set my day to the rhythm of rising.Chapter Nine\n\nThe night of the broadcast turned the estate into a front room with walls we all pretended we couldn\u2019t see. Mrs. Devlin had said she would not be making a fuss and then left her door open like a shop, radio turned to the station that was pretending it was involved, a tray of biscuits that had been dusted with sugar as if that would make them behave. Mr. Patel arrived with a bag of savouries and a face that was trying on the expression of a man who didn\u2019t care if television existed. He lasted three minutes before asking me with the solemnity of a judge whether the bunting was ironed by a professional. The kids sat on stairs in their socks as if the stairs were a cinema, Ava in the middle of a sweep of girls who all smelled of pen ink and hair spray, pretending to be unimpressed and failing every time the camera went near our bench. Mum came with a shawl that had opinions and a Tupperware full of laddus that glowed like they knew their own fame. She sat like a queen and shushed people who were not making noise.\n\nThe tent looked flatter and brighter than it had, the tricks of edit smoothing the canvas into a polite sky. \u201cI look like I slept,\u201d I said, and Becks, who had commandeered a corner of the sofa and an entire bowl of peanuts, said, \u201cThat is the magic of telly, Rahman. It washes your face with lies.\u201d She did not cry, because she has a small religion against it, but when the bit with the sugar arch and the ribbon played, when the camera framed the moment like it was waiting for a break and then agreed to like me, she hit my ankle with her toe and didn\u2019t look at me, which is our way of not being sentimental in public. The show made a poem of the panic. Zoe\u2019s voice over the top was a warm scarf, telling the nation only what it needed to know and letting the rest rest its head on the edges of the frame. I watched myself watch Mireille say balance and heard our building inhale on cue. Somebody clapped, and then pretended the clap had been for a child sitting on the step instead of for me.\n\nThe moment they announced it, the cut they had shaped out of days of noise and discipline and buns that refused to be good, went through the stairwell like a rumour in a small town. Children squealed for reasons that included me and did not. A toddler in pyjamas clapped like he had been promised a train. A man I know only as the one with the dog that hates everyone shouted, \u201cGo on, girl,\u201d down the inside of the building and then pretended he\u2019d meant it for a different girl. Mum exhaled Alhamdulillah in a way that made one of the aunties on the third floor say it too, because blessings are contagious when you aim them properly. Mr. Patel banged a spoon on a saucepan, the universal language for party, and the lift chose that moment to wed itself to the ground floor with a melancholy thud.\n\nWhat I remember of the rest is both everything and nothing. People touched my face as if it were lucky. A teenager filmed me and then filmed herself reacting to me and then filmed herself reacting to her reaction until she was a mirror in a house of mirrors. Becks went up to the first landing with a megaphone she had absolutely not brought and shouted that there would be no autographs, which made everyone laugh and then ask her for an autograph, because that is the way things work when you bring your own joke. Mrs. Devlin cried into a biscuit, which was the only way she would allow tears to be seen. Mum told three people that I do not listen and then told them that this is why I am good at life. Ava didn\u2019t look at me for a while; she looked at the telly when it was not on and then looked at her friends and then at the drawing she had pinned on our door like a coat hook, and I knew she was positioning herself inside the story so that it would not position her first.\n\nAn hour later, when people had gone back to their rooms to do the thing where you talk about a thing more honestly when it is safe, the lift decided to tell its own story. It gave one soft wheeze and then shut itself down with a politeness that felt like insult. Noush from fourteen shouted, \u201cSeriously,\u201d like a prayer, and from inside the lift a voice said, \u201cHere we go,\u201d not scared exactly, but tired of having to be brave. It was Mrs. Brar from two floors up with her shopping and a child who was not hers hanging off her sleeve.\n\nI moved without thinking because the part of me that wears a uniform has longer legs. We did the drill we have done before with more grace and less swearing. Someone called the number we all have on our phones and got the operator who sounds like he exists inside a carpet. Someone else went to fetch the engineer who knows our lift better than his own children. I knelt by the door and shouted the voice you use for things that make people listen to themselves. \u201cDeep breaths, Auntie,\u201d I said. \u201cWe are here and the lift is trying to be interesting. Don\u2019t give it the satisfaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the coriander,\u201d she said, because people in danger always tell you about the most ordinary object in their hands.\n\n\u201cWe will not let the coriander wilt,\u201d I said, and the child laughed like a squeak toy. We talked through a meditation that was mostly nonsense\u2014picture a fox with an umbrella, picture a bus that is late but faster than a man, picture a ribbon tying an arch to a cake, picture your dinner. The engineer arrived with a key that looked like a joke and did his magic and I did not move until the door opened and Mrs. Brar was there, flushed but intact, coriander aloft as if she had carried a flag. The child leapt out and ran down the hall to tell other children who would tell it better. We applauded like a country that has survived something grander than two minutes in a metal box.\n\nWhen it was quiet again, when the estate had gone back to the business of pretending to be normal, Ava came to stand in the kitchen doorway and looked at the sink like it might declare something. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that bit,\u201d she said in a voice too even to be about the lift.\n\n\u201cThe ribbon,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like the ribbon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked the ribbon,\u201d she said. \u201cI liked that you fixed it on telly, so every person knows what fixing looks like. I didn\u2019t like how the woman said \u2018your story\u2019 like it was a pet on a lead.\u201d\n\nI put my hands flat on the table because the table knows me. \u201cI can\u2019t make them stop saying story,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way they turn cake into drama. But I can keep the bits they don\u2019t get to see, and I can tell you that pie charts and pantries are stories too. We get to pick some of what goes in the book.\u201d\n\nShe put her hands next to mine, our fingers not touching but near enough for the heat to take the leap. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and her mouth did that thing where it tries to be braver than her heart and then fails and becomes something better. \u201cDo we have any of the good mangoes or did Mr. Patel take them back because you are famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is famous in a building with our lift,\u201d I said, and found the mango he had slid into the bag like a secret.\n\nThe next morning the city was kind enough to act as if nothing had happened. The bus brake sighed, the geese decided something and then undid it, the leak under the sink performed its comedy on a beat. My phone behaved like a tin roof in rain. Messages from numbers I did not recognise arrived with a tone that tried to be peer-to-peer and read like a brochure. A woman from a magazine that sells people back to themselves in shiny pages asked if I might pose in uniform holding a whisk; I said no and thought about how many whisks it might take to bring a wall down. A man from a brand that makes yoghurt in jars wrote to say I embodied the modern mother; I put his email in a folder called Not Now, Because I am my own folder and not the place where you store your versions of me. There were also messages from women I used to go to school with, and men I had trained with who never learned the grammar of their own interior. My auntie texted me a photo of me on her TV with a caption that said simply, Lips, which I knew meant the dusky lipstick had passed muster.\n\nMore important than all of that, there were orders. Messages from people in Wembley and people who used to live in Wembley and people who like to say they know Wembley when they are near it. Could they have gujiya for a family function on Sunday. Could they have pistachio cakes for a naming ceremony, not too sweet. Could they have a tray of cardamom biscuits stamped with a pattern that looks like their grandmother\u2019s tablecloth. Could I, would I, might I. I lay down on the sofa with the phone on my chest and felt expansion like a thing with weight. It\u2019s a joy that comes with maths attached. I could say yes and yes and yes and find myself at three in the morning a month from now making sugar behave in a kitchen where the extractor fan is a liar. I could rent a corner of a commercial kitchen somewhere with good light and a fridge that doesn\u2019t elbow back. I could ask Mr. Patel to act as foreman and he would do it with a whistle. I could do none of that and keep the tenderness of baking for neighbours who can knock when things go wrong.\n\nWhen I stood up, I knocked the pigeon magnet and it clattered to the floor with the small courage of things that don\u2019t break. Under it was one of Ava\u2019s notes that had been there a while, the one that said back soon in a hurry of letters. I picked it up and stuck it back with more conviction. Then I called the council and told them my name as if it were new. The woman who answered had a voice that made paper sound like a resource. We talked about food business registrations and hygiene inspections and the fact that my sink counts as a handwash basin only if I promise to be good. \u201cYou have to keep records,\u201d she said, and I said, \u201cI am in love with records,\u201d because it\u2019s almost true. She said a man called Ken would come and look at my kitchen and my soul and put a number in the window that would tell the world I am clean. I imagined a sticker as holy as a medal and told myself to mop again just in case.\n\nThe week unspooled like pastry if you\u2019re not gentle. Ava\u2019s school sent forms for a residential trip for art kids to the coast, two nights in a hostel with seagulls that have seen things. The cost made my throat tighten and then relax because sometimes I forget that invention is my mother tongue. We would make the money with flour and heat and patience and the way our neighbours open their wallets when they think the money will do something other than make a man in a suit proud. I said yes with a hand that shook and Ava said nothing for a full minute, which is her most intense form of thanks, and then left a note under the pigeon, a doodle of a seagull wearing trainers that looked like mine.\n\nKen arrived to inspect my kitchen with a clipboard and a smile that had never found irony useful. He wore a tie with violins on it and told me he had once won a pub quiz because of a question about cardamom. He liked my fridge because my fridge is trying. He frowned at my wooden spoons because he has seen things you cannot bleach out of wood. He admired my thermometer in the way men admire tools that beep. \u201cYou look like a person who cleans even when no one is watching,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cI am a person who cannot think when there are crumbs,\u201d and he nodded as if I had confessed to sainthood. He made notes that will never be read by anyone other than him and God and me. He told me to get a bigger bin and a different soap. He put a label on my window with a number that will not impress trend people and will make my aunties cry. It is amazing how much comfort a green circle can give when the world sometimes looks like a red square.\n\nThe market near Kensal was another place people invented to sell themselves. It looked like a film about a market instead of a market about food. Carrots wore their greens like opera hair. People in sunglasses peered at mushrooms as if they were fragile ideas. A woman sold wool that had not met a sheep in a year and charged as if for the company. The organiser had a name that sounded like a season and the handshake of a man who knows what rent is but has never paid it himself. He liked my pitch and did not like my tablecloth. \u201cCan you make it look more\u2014\u201d he said, and let the word fall between us like a complication. I told him my tablecloth had seen births and deaths and the scorch marks of a good life and he said, \u201cPerfect,\u201d because he has learnt that telling the truth gets you nowhere if the story is stronger.\n\nI brought the ribboned arch because it felt like a signature, set it on a dummy cake like a prop in a play about mending. People stopped. They always do when they see something that looks like more than the sum of its parts. A boy in a coat with shoulders too big came close and asked me if it was edible like he was asking if the moon had a flavour. I told him sugar tastes like the moment you decide to try again. He bought a biscuit and ate it slowly as if that would make the moment last.\n\nWe did well and we did not. The aunties did not come because it was not our place. New people came and said the word fusion with the wrong mouth. A woman asked if my military career had made me more disciplined with icing and I told her I think discipline is just a way of saying you care enough to prefer things done properly. Another woman took a photo of me without asking and I took a photo of her taking a photo and she didn\u2019t know where to look. A man who said he had a supper club in a railway arch said he could do a collaboration if I could make something that wasn\u2019t so Indian, which made me laugh in a way he didn\u2019t appreciate.\n\nHalfway through the day, Ava elbowed me and tilted her head to the right with a surgeon\u2019s precision. There was a girl stood across the aisle pretending to look at flowers. She had the look on her face I recognise from mirrors years back, the one that says, I would like to talk to you but I have used up my words on surviving. She hovered, left, came back. When she did finally approach, she had her arms crossed like a shield and a practical ponytail that could cut glass. \u201cYou\u2019re the one from the show,\u201d she said, keeping her tone bored. \u201cMy mum made me watch it because she thinks cooking means we\u2019ll talk to each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that mum,\u201d I said. \u201cShe lives in a lot of houses.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe liked when you fixed the thing,\u201d the girl said, not looking at the arch. \u201cShe made a noise at the telly. She does that when she thinks a thing is like her life and she doesn\u2019t want to say it out loud.\u201d\n\nWe stood like that for a minute, shoulder to shoulder, our eyes on a bunch of beetroot that had gone too far with its outfit. \u201cDo you like cooking,\u201d I said finally, because questions make space.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s messy,\u201d she said, which could have been an answer to anything. \u201cMy little brother likes to stir until it goes everywhere and then tell me I did it. I like drawing better because if you leave it alone for two minutes it doesn\u2019t put itself on the ceiling.\u201d\n\nI wanted to tell her about sugar stages like moods, about the quiet satisfaction of a bowl that has learnt your hand, about the way cooking gives back without asking for your history. Instead, I slid a biscuit towards her as if it had slid by itself. \u201cOn the house,\u201d I said. \u201cNot because you said I was from the show. Because you stood there until you felt like yourself.\u201d\n\nShe nodded and left with the particular dignity of girls who have taught themselves not to say thank you for things they should have had anyway. Ava watched her go with her face softened into something that made me think of her when she was small, when gratitude was a full-body event. \u201cPeople come to you like you\u2019re a bus stop,\u201d she said, munching on a broken bit with the air of a thief. \u201cThey know you\u2019ll go somewhere even if they don\u2019t know where.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes they get on and sometimes they just read the timetable,\u201d I said. \u201cEither way the bus stops keeps existing.\u201d\n\nBack home, the money counted itself into piles that made sense and then tilted. I looked at the landlord\u2019s letter again and had the thought I have been refusing: maybe we will have to move. The idea had been sitting under the sink with the leak. It had mould, it had a smell, it had the particular misery of thinking about removing magnets from a fridge. I put it back where it had been and promised myself a month. A month of markets and orders and small acts of commerce in between drills and floods and Ava\u2019s occasional need to leave a room and breathe drawing air. A month to see if I could make my kitchen stand up on legs that were not just stubbornness.\n\nPrivate Lewis\u2019s sister came into the shop where I was lurking by the flour with a shy sort of purpose and asked if I would make a cake for her wedding in April. \u201cA small one,\u201d she said, hands like a bird, \u201cbecause we cannot afford your big ones from telly, but small with attention.\u201d I said attention is free and she cried as if I had handed her the ocean and then hugged me with a fierceness that saved us both. We chose flavours that would please her uncles and keep her mother from saying the word dry. We made a plan that involved sugar flowers because she liked the way they keep living. She told me she had watched the episode with her fianc\u00e9 who had been quiet and then said he would like to be the ribbon in their story and I pretended to laugh because I do not want men to know I can be charmed.\n\nThe Army decided to put me on a course for a week about leadership in conditions that are adverse but not hostile, a phrase that covers more of life than doctrine knows. Becks sent me a list of items I didn\u2019t need to bring and then turned up with half of them anyway because she believes in preparedness for other people. The course was in a building that looked like a 70s library and acted like a boot. Men with haircuts discussed calm with the furrowed brows of people who punch things in their spare time. A major with the expression of a man who blesses his toast told us that leadership is posture and language, and I thought about how many ways there are to stand and to speak and how often I have chosen softness before volume and paid for it twice. We did exercises that involved moving heavy objects together without spilling them, which is motherhood turned into team-building. When we had to stand up and deliver a plan to a room pretending to be sceptical, I opened my mouth and the words came out in the voice I had been using in my kitchen to tell sugar that I love it but not to be silly. After, a captain told me that watching me made him breathe slower and I said I would invoice him.\n\nAva texted me photos of her eating round meals with my mother and of the fox that had decided the estate was his now and of the seagull on the school roof that had started a feud with a boy named Idris. She included the kind of commentary that is half humour, half a map of her mood. On the third day of the course, she sent one line: Can we dye my hair the colour of pistachio shells. I wrote back Yes if you write me a paragraph about why and she sent me three sentences about being visible when you don\u2019t know what you want and about the way brown hair is fine and also it is a landscape she would like to draw on. We went to a place that smelled like hair and gossip and did it softly, softly, the colour like a suggestion. She came out with a halo of green that made her look like a story without making her look like a warning. Mum pretended to disapprove and then took fifty photos.\n\nThe thing about being seen is that it does not stop on its own. The show\u2019s social team posted a clip of me saying \u201cnot too shy\u201d to ghee, and people argued pleasantly about whether British food needs more spice or less personality. Someone found my old post about the arch with ribbon and an account with the taste of a brand asked if I might like to collaborate on a \u201cResilience Recipe,\u201d which made me want to go and sit in the lift and tell it stories until it gave up. A man who had never eaten saffron told me it is too much and I told him his opinion had underproved. I learned to say no with the voice of a person who says yes to things that feed her people. I learned to put my phone in the drawer with the spoons at certain hours and let it sulk.\n\nOne evening after the course, just as the light was thinking about giving up, there was a bang from the stairwell that had the texture of a judgement. I went out with the reflex of a mother and a sergeant and found Mrs. Devlin sitting on the second landing with her back against the wall, her face pale in a way I have learnt to respect. \u201cIt\u2019s my daft heart,\u201d she said with the briskness of a woman who refuses to die in public. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It remembers to beat, but sometimes it wants applause.\u201d We did exactly what you do: called, counted, breathed. Ava sat on one side and told her about the seagull feud. I sat on the other and listed quietly every biscuit we had made that week. The paramedics arrived with their efficient kindness and carried her downstairs with the grace of a ceremony. She told them they were handsome and they told her she had the best hat they had seen all day. They took her away and the stairwell exhaled and we went home and I stood over the sink and shook in a way I allowed only there, in the presence of plates and a leak that keeps its own counsel.\n\nShe came back three days later with a plaster on her hand and a diagnosis she recited to the building in a voice of triumph. \u201cA blip,\u201d she said, from her doorway like a newsreader. \u201cThey said it\u2019s thinking about retiring. I told it we do not have the money. I am on pills that will make me pee like a river. Bring me your gossip and a sponge cake if you have one.\u201d We did. Mum sent over a broth that could heal a small country. Mr. Patel offered her a mango and she told him not to flirt and he pretended to be offended. The building re-learned the sound it makes when the heart of it has hiccupped and come back.\n\nThe rent letter sat on the table like a toad. I looked at it in different lights to see if it might change its mind. I did the sums again and again until the numbers became faces. Ava\u2019s trip. Mum\u2019s prescriptions. Saffron. Socks. Rice. The Army pays. The cakes pay a bit. The market pays in compliments and a yellow sticker for my Instagram. The drill hall pays in lungs. The landlord wants to pay for a holiday and maybe a new front door in a different postcode. I told myself my home is a many-roomed thing. I told myself perhaps the walls have to change for the rooms to keep existing. I told myself we are many people and we do not need to prove it by staying in one place. I told myself I am not convincing.\n\nOn a Tuesday that smelled like wet newspaper, Zoe rang with the voice she uses when she is asking me something I might hate. \u201cChristmas special,\u201d she said, and I could hear a roomful of people behind her pretending to be spontaneous. \u201cThe network wants a reunion thing. Not full tent. Just you in your kitchen with a candle and a ridiculous sweater. A little sequence for after the Queen\u2014sorry, the King\u2014does his thing. You making something that looks like a jewel and saying something that makes people feel like their sofa loves them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a ridiculous sweater,\u201d I said. \u201cI have a jumper my ex bought from a shop that makes you smell like money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cThe contrast. Can we come on the twelfth. We\u2019ll bring candles. We\u2019ll bring a woman who is excellent with light. We will bring a ham if you want. We will bring nothing if that\u2019s kinder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will bring the kindness,\u201d I said. \u201cEverything else can be argued over.\u201d\n\nAva overheard me agreeing and said, \u201cAre we going to be the people who are on at Christmas,\u201d with a disdain disguising delight. \u201cBecause Rani\u2019s cousins are going to make fun of me and I will pretend not to like it and secretly be made of light.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be the people who make a saffron jewel,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will not be the people who sell tea towels with our faces on. Not yet.\u201d\n\nThe twelfth came with crew and fairy lights and a willingness to rearrange my kitchen so it looked like better versions of itself. Mum sat at the table wearing a sari that made Zoe make a face like prayer. Becks turned up with a Yule log she had bought because she cannot stand to arrive with a face only. They filmed me stirring milk and saffron into a gold that looked like it might have opinions about monarchy. They filmed my hands tying Ava\u2019s hair with a ribbon while pretending they were filming the ribbon. They filmed the fox under the bins as if he were a metaphor and then told me he was uncredited. I said a little thing about being held by a city and not letting it break you, and Zoe cried in spite of herself and then swore because it had become a habit.\n\nA week later, a letter came to the building addressed to me but without my flat number, which means a stranger had to ask Mrs. Devlin which door to push it under. It was from Private Lewis\u2019s mother on lined paper that had been in a drawer that used to hold bills. She wrote about his tears at biscuits and about his pride, which is a word that doesn\u2019t sit easily in that family but had found a chair. She asked if he could carry my cake to the table at the wedding because he wanted to do something delicate in public and not be mocked. \u201cHe is good with delicate,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe once put a butterfly outside that had flown into our bathroom and he did not make fun of himself.\u201d I wrote back yes in a hand that tried to behave and told her to tell him I would let him hold the arch for a minute so long as he did not cough.\n\nTwo days before the Christmas special, the landlord posted a second letter with a tone that could curdle milk. He said he understood that the market had made things hard, but his costs were also rising, as if his costs had blood in them. He said he would be inspecting in January to assess wear and tear, and the words wore their own shoes. I rang him and the phone went to the voice of a man who has paid someone else to be his voice. I left a message I should not have, heat under the edges, and then I baked something with cinnamon for the first time in months because I wanted to remember why it is softer, why it goes in postcards and not speeches.\n\nMarcus rang in the afternoon to tell me that a friend had mentioned an opportunity in Manchester, a unit above a shop that could be a kitchen if I were brave. \u201cYou\u2019re itinerant,\u201d he said, with love that had forgotten where it came from. \u201cYou can bake anywhere you put a table.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can bake where my child knows the sound of the bus,\u201d I said. \u201cI can bake where a fox knows my bins. I can bake in rooms that know how to say my name without it turning into an advert.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that,\u201d he said, injured by a tone he would have used on me without apology. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking of options.\u201d\n\n\u201cOptions are good,\u201d I said, and we hung up with our postures in two different centuries.\n\nWe did Christmas like a small country that knows itself. Mum cooked too much and packed me containers I will never return. Ava wore a jumper with a fox in a scarf that had found its way from a shop it shouldn\u2019t have. The special came on with the kind of niceness that would make me smirk in July but in December becomes medicine. There I was, on the telly, in my kitchen that had been polished with light, stirring gold and telling a camera that you can be more than one thing at once and feed everyone you love without running out. Mr. Patel texted me a photo of his family in front of his television with all of their chins up as if they were in a portrait. Becks sent a voice note in which she pretended to be unmoved and then swore. The building was quiet at ten in that way that means someone had a row earlier and it went on long enough and is now sleeping. The fox went about his business and I did mine.\n\nIn January, the inspection came in the shape of a man wearing a coat that had never met a lift. He walked around my kitchen with a tape measure like I was going to sell it by the yard. He noted the leak under the sink, which I have been noting for months, and tutted as if the leak were gossiping about him. He peered at the skirting and asked about wear and tear and I showed him the scorch mark on the table and told him it was not the flat\u2019s fault, and he smiled with his mouth. He asked about my \u201clittle business,\u201d and I told him it had a number in the window and a rating and he said that was nice in the way people say that when they are trying to turn a person into a hobby. When he left he said, \u201cWe all have to move sometime,\u201d as if that were a proverb, and I closed the door and swore with a sophistication that would have impressed Staff.\n\nI told Ava we might have to go. I told her late in the day when her defences are down and the world has softened, because cruelty is not a personality. She listened with a face that did not have a tantrum in it, and then she did the thing I am always both ready for and surprised by; she made a plan. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, her voice turning into notes. \u201cIf we move, we move near enough to a bus I know, and near Mrs. Devlin if she\u2019ll let us, and near Mum because food, and also not near anyone who thinks wearing a coat inside is a personality. And we keep the kettle. And we keep the pigeon magnet. And we make a map before and after. And we call the kitchen something cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would we call it,\u201d I said, because hope is a habit you have to practice.\n\nShe thought for a second, brow doing its clever knot, and then said, \u201cRibbon & Arch,\u201d like she had been keeping it in her pocket for months. \u201cBecause everything is held together and also we live under a curve.\u201d\n\nI wrote it down in my notebook in letters that made my heart feel less fidgety. The name took the room like a calm. I could see it on a sticker and a box and a sign that would be painted by a person who loves letters. I could see it on a ticket for a market where carrots wear velvet; I could see it on a receipt written in my auntie\u2019s hand with the flourish she reserves for people who get married. I could see it on a piece of paper I gave to Ken for the records he keeps because people should keep such records.\n\nWhen Lewis\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding day came, we did the cake in slices that looked like argument and peace side by side. The hall was decorated with ribbon that pretended to have opinions. Lewis wore his suit like a person who had been taught posture in a field. He lifted the cake as if it were an animal that might spook and carried it across the floor with his head high, cheeks flushed, the room watching in a way that would have hurt him once and now made him grin. He put it down like a prayer and stepped back and his mother cried and then laughed because she refuses to cry for too long in front of people who might use it. We stood in a corner later with paper plates and talked about briefings and biscuits and the way a good day holds its shape. He told me he thought about applying to a course for medics, that he liked the idea of his hands being useful when it was dark. I told him to do it before the city convinced him otherwise. He said he would keep a biscuit in his pocket like a reason.\n\nAfter the wedding, I walked home the long way to make the day longer. The stadium lights were off, which always makes it look honest. The arch was a ghost and then a spine and then nothing and then there again. I stopped by the canal and the water did its argument with gravity. The fox on the path paused and looked at me with the slant of tolerance he reserves for neighbours. Somewhere a bus closed its doors like it was tired of itself. I thought about Ribbon & Arch on a door in a street I could draw with my eyes shut. I thought about a kitchen where the leak got fixed and the light didn\u2019t argue and the floor didn\u2019t crunch. I thought about my people, my army, my aunties, my child, the way we have made a room together out of all our competing purposes.\n\nWhen I got in, there was a card on the mat addressed to Lila and underlined like a baton. Inside was a note from a woman named Bernadette who ran the community centre near the library. She had seen the article about the stall and liked the part about being held by a city. She said their kitchen was underused and their rate was modest and their windows were high. Would I like a key on Tuesdays and Thursdays and a folder with the names of other people\u2019s mothers. Would I like a locker and a shelf with my name on it and a place to keep a bin that no one would move. Would I like to teach a class to people who think cake is a thing other people eat. Would I like to be a person who walks in and flicks on a strip light and is warmed by the warmth of rooms.\n\nI sat at the table and put my head in my hands and laughed like a person who has been thirsty and found a tap. I texted Mr. Patel and he replied with a mango emoji and the word Finally. I texted Becks and she sent a photo of her in a beret with the caption Chef! and then another saying, you can order me about in a kitchen but if you tell me to julienne I\u2019ll tell your Mum. I texted Mum and she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring laddus to the first class and tell everyone they are not allowed to leave until their ghee behaviour improves.\u201d I went to Ava\u2019s room and showed her the card and she held it like a ticket and said, \u201cCan we put the fox on the sign,\u201d and I said, \u201cHe\u2019ll eat the letters,\u201d and she said, \u201cExactly.\u201d\n\nThe next day, I met Bernadette in a room that resembled every community centre kitchen you have ever seen and yet, because I stood in it, felt like the first kitchen. Steel tables that had known arguments and compromises. A fridge for milk and forgotten yogurt. A cupboard where the tea lived next to a bag of pasta that had its own origin story. She showed me the sinks and the thermometer and the light that flickered like a thought and said she would get the caretaker to look at it. She showed me the back door and the fire exit and the shelf with space for my tins. She showed me the view of the library, which is to say the view of the people who think so much the air burns. I put my hand on the steel table as if to take its temperature. It was cool and ready. I could feel the hum of the town hall across the way, the small solar system of people doing their jobs with too little money and too much competence.\n\nWe made a plan that involved Tuesdays and Thursdays and a register and a key that looked like a key in a book. We shook hands like grown-ups. She told me she liked my show face and she liked my neighbour face more. She told me the scout group came on Wednesdays and sometimes left glitter and apologies. She told me the cleaner was called Blessing and she was exactly that. I left with a key in my pocket, and in my body a feeling like I had unfurled something I had been keeping folded for too long.\n\nOn the walk home, the geese had one of their meetings and I stopped and told them about Ribbon & Arch because I am not too dignified to inform birds of my plans. The stadium was off again and in that offness it was more ours. The bus brake sighed. A neighbour played a song I haven\u2019t loved in years and made me love it a bit again just because it came through a wall. Mr. Patel had written OPEN CLOSED OPEN on his sign with a question mark. Mrs. Devlin\u2019s door was half-ajar and the smell of something celebratory slid out. Ava was at the kitchen table with her pencil case open like a city and her head bent over a list of things seagulls do that we do not admire and should not imitate.\n\nI put the key in the middle of the table and we both looked at it. It wasn\u2019t large. It had no ribbon. It didn\u2019t hum. But it was heavy in a way that made sense. It was the weight of something that unlocked other people\u2019s doors as well as mine, that made the private part of what I do into a public act without making me a liar. Ava reached out and touched it with one finger like it might bite and then grinned up at me with all her old baby teeth shining through her new girl face. \u201cYou\u2019ll let me paint the fox on a wall,\u201d she said, more statement than question, and I said, \u201cWe will see what Blessing says,\u201d because we live in a community and we have our manners.\n\nThat night, I took my notebook and wrote in it like I used to when I was a soldier and the only way to make sense of the day was to arrange it on a page. Ribbon & Arch at the top in a hand that looked like I had practised hope. Under it: Tuesdays and Thursdays, Bernadette, church hall tea urn, Blessing, key. Under that: gujiya class for aunties who pretend they don\u2019t need instruction, one cake a week for people getting married and people getting buried, three trays of biscuits for Mr. Patel to sell to men who need to feel generous before their wives do. Under that: find a way to tell the landlord that we will move if we have to but not quietly. Under that: the Army still there, the drill hall still there, Becks and her crisp life still there, the people in Yorkshire and on Salisbury Plain and on parade squares that are also home. Under that: don\u2019t forget to breathe when the sugar gets to hard crack, don\u2019t forget to look at your child when she is walking out of a room so she knows you see her very much, don\u2019t forget to write down where you are going when you go, don\u2019t forget to leave the note under the pigeon, don\u2019t forget to put your shoulders down.\n\nBefore I slept, I went to the window because I always do, because the world likes to be checked on. The fox trotted under the bins as if he had a list. The lift wheezed and then didn\u2019t. The stadium held its shape. The arch was a thin line against a faraway sky, a memory, a dare. I thought about the ribbon that had made it pardonable to break. I thought about the girl at the market who had stood there until she felt like her own name again. I thought about my father\u2019s handwriting, the way it made a path for my face, telling me thirty-two is just another number you fill with meaning or neglect. I thought about Ken and his green circle. I thought about Mum and her slack hand on the arm of the sofa when a programme is good. I thought about Becks and her ankle taped in 2012. I thought about Private Lewis and his hands, gentle on a cake even when the room watched. I thought about a key on the table and a sign that does not yet exist and a sticker that will one day be on a door. And then I slept, the careful sleep of someone who knows the morning will ask her to rise and knows she can say yes.",

                              "content": "The night before the email, I was dusting cardamom over dough like a whisper. Wembley was a hum outside my window: a late bus sighing along the High Road, someone on a balcony laughing too loud, a fox flicking through the bins with the audacity of a king. The stadium lights\u2014when they\u2019re on, even in winter\u2014bleed a faint brightness into the sky, as if dawn is on repeat. I rolled the pin over pastry and kept my shoulders low, the way Staff used to tell me to keep them when the wind picked up on Salisbury Plain. Posture matters. Dough knows when you\u2019re tense, and so does a rifle.\n\n\u201cMum?\u201d Ava\u2019s voice was a thin thread from the doorway, not quite unravelled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s late, star,\u201d I said, believing that the sugar and the cardamom smoothed my voice. \u201cBack to bed. First bell\u2019s early, yeah? I\u2019ll bring you one in the morning if these work.\u201d\n\nShe came into the light, hair in a crooked plait, a school tie looped around her wrist like a bracelet. Thirteen going on some age I couldn\u2019t always make out. \u201cI could taste one now?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d take the roof of your mouth off. They\u2019re scorching.\u201d\n\nAva pulled a face, kissed my shoulder, and padded back along the hall. She still has the light footfall of a child avoiding creaks. Sometimes that undoes me. I pinched the seam on a little parcel and tried not to think of the tour, of the way sand gets everywhere whether you invite it or not, into your socks, into your sleep, into the bit of you that cracks jokes while you\u2019re counting. When I looked up, the oven glass held my reflection: apron with flour graffiti, hair screwed up any which way, an old service tee because they\u2019re all soft after so many washes.\n\nI get called Sergeant at the drill hall. I get called Lila at the corner shop where Mr. Patel saves me the good mangoes because he says \u201cyou know the ones with the scent, Lila, not the bland ones that break your heart.\u201d I get called Mum here, in this little flat with two bedrooms and a squeaky washer that wants to be a helicopter. You learn to move between names the way you move between stances. Smooth. Without checking your footing every time.\n\nThe email came at ten fifty-seven the next morning, and I didn\u2019t see it until lunch, after I\u2019d come back from a run through Barham Park where the geese had a meeting about something vitally important and refused to make space for me. I was cutting through the kitchen when my phone lit with the blue bar and the subject line like a banner in a parade. London Home Bakers Challenge \u2014 Finalist Confirmation. I wiped my hands on the tea towel. Then wiped them again, because habit. And I looked.\n\nDear Lila, we are delighted\u2014\n\nI read the word delighted twice because it didn\u2019t sound like it belonged to me. It tasted like someone else\u2019s story. My hand found the edge of the counter and rested there so hard my knuckles went white.\n\n\u201cMum?\u201d Ava\u2019s bag collided with the hallway shoe rack in the kind of war the shoe rack always loses. \u201cMum. I think Mr. Hampton thinks you\u2019re in the Army. He asked me if your boots are shiny.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re murderous,\u201d I said, which made her smirk, and then my phone slide lit again because I\u2019d tapped it by accident, and the subject line was still there. I pulled my elbows in. \u201cAva, star. Come here.\u201d\n\nShe came, breath a little fast from the stairs, hair fallen out of the plait, tie gone. There was glitter on her cheek because of course there was. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook.\u201d I turned the phone to her. There\u2019s a tiny pause when your child reads something important over your shoulder, the pattern of their eyes moving across lines that can rearrange a week.\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d she said, then louder, \u201cno way! Is that the final-final?\u201d\n\n\u201cFinal-final,\u201d I said, and the words were both weight and helium. I breathed them in. Annoyingly, my hands were shaking, so I had to put the phone down so I wouldn\u2019t drop it into the sink and destroy my one ticket out of the ordinary.\n\n\u201cRing someone,\u201d Ava said, bouncing on her toes. \u201cRing\u2014Becky?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecks,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019ll be on days maybe. She\u2019ll be standing on a range with a megaphone, and she\u2019ll make me do burpees to celebrate.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it. Do it. Please, do it. And can we tell Nani? Grandma will explode. Like, actually.\u201d\n\nI put a palm to her cheek for a second because sometimes she\u2019s still my child, not this roving comet. \u201cWe will. After homework. After\u2026 shoes. In the rack. A concept so far removed from your understanding.\u201d\n\nAva made a face and went to retrieve them. I breath-laughed and called Becks.\n\n\u201cSergeant Rahman,\u201d she answered, loud wind buffeting her phone. I could hear lads in the background calling timings, boots crunching on gravel. \u201cIf you want a day off, get a doctor\u2019s note. If you want a medal, get in line. If you want me to tell you to breathe, not in this tone.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a nightmare,\u201d I said, grinning into the sink like a fool. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got news.\u201d\n\n\u201cScone news or military news?\u201d\n\n\u201cBaking,\u201d I said. \u201cFinals. I\u2019m in the final, Bex. The actual one. I would pinch you if you were here.\u201d\n\nShe whooped. She really did. A proper delighted sound that ricocheted around the range and off a few helmets, by the sound of it. \u201cListen up, you muppets,\u201d she shouted at someone, \u201cour Rahman\u2019s about to decorate the nation with her buttercream. You will address her as Ma\u2019am at all times and you will bring her piping tips at the double.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, laughing into my sleeve. \u201cDon\u2019t, please. I haven\u2019t told Mum yet. Keep it in the platoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know me, vault of secrets. Lila\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou deserve it. Don\u2019t roll your eyes\u2014I can smell it over the line. Don\u2019t. You do. You work until you\u2019re see-through, and you make cakes that made Private Lewis cry. Honest to God tears. Go get it. And if you need a palate cleanser for the judges, I\u2019ll bring MREs and we\u2019ll see who keeps a straight face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might hold you to that,\u201d I said, blinking stupidly at the kettle because crying in front of your friend while she\u2019s in charge of a live fire exercise is bad form. \u201cI\u2019ll call tonight. After Mum.\u201d\n\nAfter Mum meant a call that would last forty minutes where she would tell me what to wear, what to cook, and what not to say. After Mum meant I\u2019d listen to the familiar orbit of her worry and her pride, one around the other, like those old models of the solar system. I turned back to the dough, to the way flour dust settles on the surface of water like a first snow, and felt something open in me that had been tight all morning.\n\nOn the High Road Mr. Patel did that thing where he makes a face like he\u2019s not impressed even as his eyebrows go up. \u201cFinal. Hah. Final is just the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should put that on a banner,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd pay me royalties when it heals the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will make a cake like a story,\u201d he said, tapping his chest over his heart. He has known me since I was twelve and bought cheap gum from his counter because I wanted to be seen buying something. \u201cYou will put Wembley on the map, as if we are not already on the map every time it is a match and men shout. Something with saffron?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething with saffron,\u201d I agreed, and bought an outrageous pinch that made me feel extravagant and braver than is my baseline. I bought pistachios too, the ones with skins that flake under your fingers and stain them a little green, the good kind. The judge with the hair like a parfait once said my flavours were okay. Okay. The word had lodged in my throat like a pebble. Not just okay this time, I promised the nuts. Not just.\n\nBack at the flat, I leaned on the kitchen drawer that sticks and thought about the final, about the three bakes. Signature that shows who you are. A technical that you can\u2019t predict. A showstopper that makes them remember you even when the lights are down. The producers had called twice in the last week with questions that sounded innocuous. What\u2019s Wembley to you? What does your uniform mean in the kitchen? Who taught you to roll a roti without it sticking? They want a story more than a cake. They want tears in the right places and a grandmother in a sari in 4K. It\u2019s not untrue. It\u2019s just not everything.\n\nI called Mum. She picked up on the second ring as if she\u2019d been holding the phone in her hand, waiting for it to function as proof that life moves forward.\n\n\u201cAmu?\u201d she said, in the voice she used when I got my first trainer, my first stripe, my first careful disobedience. \u201cYou called. Are you hungry? I made dal. Not like how you make it, obviously you add so many things. I made simple.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the final,\u201d I said, because if I didn\u2019t say it at once, I might not say it at all. \u201cMum. They\u2019re putting me in the final.\u201d\n\nSilence, then a breath that sounded like she\u2019d been holding it since I said I was enlisting at nineteen. \u201cOh,\u201d she said. \u201cOh, my heart. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. My Lila. Your father would have\u2026 he\u2019s probably waking the whole neighbourhood wherever he is, banging pots.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s your domain,\u201d I said, and then we both breathed for a few seconds because grief is a thing you do alongside joy, like dancing with a limp.\n\n\u201cYou must wear that nice lipstick,\u201d she said when she had finished telling me that no child has manners as good as mine and gently implying that the other bakers will have sad, soulless sponges. \u201cThe dusky one. Not the bright one. It looks like you ate a chilli.\u201d\n\n\u201cMum.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your hair. Not messy. You think messy is art. It is not. It is lazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have a stylist, Ma.\u201d\n\n\u201cA what?\u201d\n\n\u201cA person they pay to wrangle my hair into looking like it belongs to a person who has slept. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not just this soldier they always go on about,\u201d she said, warming, the space heater of her worry moving down the room. \u201cYou are soft. People don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey might,\u201d I said. \u201cSometimes I forget.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall your aunties. No, I will call them. You will be too modest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d I said. \u201cOkay. Mum\u2026 listen. Ava\u2019s fine. She\u2019s fine. But if she needs to stay with you for one of the filming days\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is always welcome. She knows her way to the biscuit tin without even looking. And the temple is doing that youth thing on Saturday; I will take her. She can pretend she is not listening while I talk to the aunties. She likes to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe likes to act like she just arrived from a planet where conversations do not exist,\u201d I said. \u201cThanks, Ma.\u201d\n\nAfter I hung up, I stood at the sink like I was waiting for something to materialise there, a coin at the bottom of a fountain. A car alarm warbled somewhere like a laugh you can\u2019t settle. I looked around this kitchen that has seen me icing cakes at two a.m., washing cam cream off my hands and watching the water go grey, telling Ava stories about the street festival when she was small enough to ride my shoulders. The table is second-hand oak with scorch marks from a pan that had opinions. The magnets on the fridge are souvenirs we didn\u2019t buy, gathered from friends who go places. The window frame needs painting. There\u2019s a tuppaware bowl under the sink catching a leak that has not been sorted despite six calls to the landlord. My whole life is in here, but not all of it fits.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why baking feels like an answer. There\u2019s a kind of command in the way dough yields to intention. You can fix texture with patience, temperature with knowledge, sugar with sour. You can put something in your hands and transform it into something you can offer. No one expects you to talk about the rest. They take a fork and they say amazing and you put another slice on their plate because the action of doing so is a grace that beats words to the line.\n\nAva did homework like it offended her, like the equations had insulted her footwear. Later, over dal and rotis that I should have let prove longer, she slid me a sheet from her bag.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\n\n\u201cArt thing,\u201d she said, shrugging. \u201cThey want a piece about home.\u201d\n\n\u201cA poem?\u201d\n\n\u201cA drawing. Or like\u2014anything. Mixed media. Mr. Hampton likes me too much, and I don\u2019t know what to do when a teacher likes me too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall my agent,\u201d I said. \u201cWhat do you think of when I say home?\u201d\n\nHer mouth did that thing where the corner lifts and drops. \u201cYou cooking,\u201d she said, not quite looking at me, \u201cand the little fan in the bathroom being annoying. Mrs. Devlin\u2019s radio with the horse racing, because she never turns it down. The bus braking. And like\u2014your boots by the radiator.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy boots have more personality than both of us put together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t leave them alone. They will go out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo a drawing,\u201d I said. \u201cNot perfect. Just the bits. Sometimes the bits together make more sense than the plan.\u201d\n\nShe picked at the edge of the table, at one of the scorch marks she has never confessed to. \u201cYour final. Will Dad come?\u201d\n\nI had to look down to roll a roti I didn\u2019t need to roll. \u201cHe might,\u201d I said. \u201cHe said he was in Manchester this month for the project. But he said he\u2019d try.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll come when the cameras are on,\u201d she said, unfussy and sharp. It\u2019s not untrue. \u201cHe\u2019s not all bad, Mum. He\u2019s just\u2026 he\u2019s a glitter person. He likes when things sparkle. You\u2019re more like\u2014bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what I mean,\u201d she said, and when she smiled she looked five for a second, and that undid me worse than anything. \u201cYou\u2019re the thing that makes all the other things okay.\u201d\n\nLater, with her asleep behind her door, the tie abandoned on the floor like it had melted, I took my notebook from the drawer and wrote three words at the top of a fresh page: Showstopper: Wembley. It was obvious, maybe too obvious. But sometimes the obvious is right. I drew the arch before I could talk myself out of it, then two tiers of cake that could hold it\u2014saffron sponge with cardamom syrup, pistachio crunch Insert. I sketched piping like thread, like the henna my aunties used to draw in summer. I wrote balance? and underlined it a few times, then wrote rope sugar? because I am not a sugar artist and never will be but there are videos, and I have hands, and the night is long.\n\nThe next morning I ran past the stadium because that\u2019s what you do when a thing is in your head. One of the workmen waved, because they always do, because you become part of the neighbourhood\u2019s soundtrack if you repeat yourself long enough in one place. I held my pace and thought about the old men at the caf\u00e9 near Elm Road who drink tea like an argument, about the Polish lady at the laundrette who tells me whether the weather means sweaters just by the way she says \u201ctoday,\u201d about Mrs. Devlin who calls me soldier girl with a smile that\u2019s both missing and bright.\n\n\u201cYou in the telly show?\u201d she said that afternoon, when I brought her a slice of the pistachio cake for field research. \u201cThe one I pretend to hate and then have strong opinions about. That one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat one,\u201d I said. Mrs. Devlin had set up camp by her window with a blanket and a paperback that used to be a romance before the print wore out. The radio muttered horses. \u201cDon\u2019t tell the rest of them yet, or I\u2019ll have a party line on the stairwell.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be a vault,\u201d she said, tapping the side of her nose where a bit of powder had creased. \u201cDo they make you cry? You can cry if you want. No one on the route will make fun. They cry when Arsenal lose; they won\u2019t give you grief for a cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try to hold it together,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to put sad music behind me.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will. Don\u2019t you worry. Every time you inhale, the violins will wake up. Come in here on Sunday for my roast if you need a break from sugar. It will put hair on your chest if I don\u2019t overcook it. Which I might.\u201d\n\nShe watched me for a second like I was a soap she\u2019d been watching since episode one. \u201cYour girl. She\u2019s got that face on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich one.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one that says she wants to be a woman and a little girl and a dragon and doesn\u2019t know how to fit all those into one hoodie. Keep your mouth soft with her. She will tell you her secrets and then pretend she did not.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, because the urge to tell Mrs. Devlin about every small thing Ava does is not one I always win. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nAt the drill hall, I stitched my shoulders into the jacket like armour because it is. The air smells like oil and sweat and tea, a combination that will one day be bottled and sold as British Graft. Captain Dunne nodded at me with the precise nod that means both hello and you are ten seconds late, which I wasn\u2019t, but he has never been wrong a day in his life apparently. We did drills until my breath was a shape inside my chest, until the rhythm under my feet was the only thing in my head. There\u2019s a relief in obeying orders when you have been making all your own decisions in a kitchen where a teaspoon too much is a disaster and a heartbeat too late is a sugar burn.\n\nOn a break, Private Lewis\u2014the one who cried about the biscuits\u2014sidled up. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he said, because Becks had bullied them all into calling me some version of ma\u2019am that is both joke and respect, \u201cif you take the trophy thing or the cake stand or whatever they give you, can we polish it? I want to see my face in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring it by,\u201d I said, \u201cif I remember you when I\u2019m famous.\u201d\n\nHe looked panicked. \u201cDon\u2019t. Don\u2019t forget me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I said, and I won\u2019t. The Army gives you back a part of your brain that civilian life takes without asking. It returns something about the way you belong to more than one person. It refuses to let you hunch.\n\nOn the bus home a woman with a baby asleep on her chest smiled at me, then looked at the boots tucked under the seat, then at my hands with flour in the lines I hadn\u2019t scrubbed hard enough. \u201cLong day?\u201d\n\n\u201cLong month,\u201d I said. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cThirty-two hours,\u201d she said, patting the baby\u2019s back like a soft drum. \u201cNo one tells you about the bits where you feel like a sink with the plug out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one tells you lots of things,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you want the seat? The whole of it? I can stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take your cake, though. If that\u2019s an option.\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cNot on me. But I could give you the address of my kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cBehave,\u201d she said, we shared a grin like we were conspirators, and for three stops the bus was a kind place.\n\nThe producer called that evening, a woman named Zoe with a warm voice like a scarf. \u201cHi, Lila, just checking the email found you well,\u201d she said as if it was a cliche she\u2019d dressed up a bit. \u201cCan I talk through the shoot days and a few questions? Great. So. The final will be three days\u2014one day rehearsal, two days shoot. We\u2019ll need you in the tent from six a.m. We\u2019ll mic you, we\u2019ll get some b-roll of you rolling stuff, sorry, and if you can bring a prop\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA prop?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything to do with your story. Boots? A family recipe book? A photo? We want to make sure your\u2014identity\u2014comes across.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy identity fits in the tent?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will if we ask nicely,\u201d she said, and then there was a little pause. \u201cWe loved your semifinal. The judges thought your pistachio layer was under. Sorry. That\u2019s their phrasing. Under. But they also thought your mawa cakes were a revelation. They used the word revelation. We didn\u2019t egg them to say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d I said. \u201cCan I ask. The technical. Is it\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNice try. Bring your courage and your patience. Also, could we shoot at your place? A tiny few minutes? Your daughter, perhaps, if that\u2019s okay. A scene in Wembley might be lovely. Stadium in the background. You know.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll blur my house number, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will blur you into a film star,\u201d she said, and I liked her despite my cynicism. That\u2019s a danger with nice voices. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a runner drop a schedule. There\u2019ll be a car. And yes, catering. And a minders to stop people hugging you with jam hands.\u201d\n\nAfter we hung up, I looked at the boots by the radiator and tried to imagine them as a prop. They have clawed clumps of Salisbury mud in the grooves from last month\u2019s exercise that the kitchen brush will not respect. They are both exactly who I am and entirely a costume. I wiped the toe of one with my sleeve and laughed at myself, because of course I did.\n\nAva had left a note on the table in the ragged letters she still uses for me, on purpose, like she knows I will forgive any information if it\u2019s delivered in that font. Went to Rani\u2019s to return book. Back before eight. X. Rani lives two floors down with a mother who cooks like it\u2019s a game she intends to win and a father who laughs as if he\u2019s had a quiet life. I put the note on the fridge under the magnet shaped like a pigeon and thought about sending a message. Then I didn\u2019t. Ava must have told me with the note because she wanted the space to be a choice and not a permission. I can be good at not hovering. Sometimes.\n\nI tried the Wembley arch in sugar. It broke in three places. I tried it again and burnt my finger and said a word my mother wouldn\u2019t like. I watched a video where a woman with nails like weaponry coaxed sugar into ropes with the patience of a saint and made it look like breathing. I failed in the same place three times and then on the fourth try got one curve that I could rest a finger on without it falling to ruin.\n\n\u201cNaughty,\u201d I said to no one, and set it down like a crown.\n\nAt seven-thirty Ava came back with wind in her hair and that look like she\u2019d seen an idea and tried it on. \u201cWe watched a vlog,\u201d she started immediately, \u201cand it was this girl who lives in like\u2014Canada? And she draws everything she eats. Like she keeps a scrapbook of what her week tastes like. Imagine if we did that. Imagine if we\u2014you could draw your cakes. Not like in your notebook. Like art-art. War cake. Civilian cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that the binary,\u201d I said. \u201cNot everything is war\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that. But it is. It\u2019s like. Opposites in a bit of you. Mum. Your hands smell like toffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cOccupational hazard,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you want to lick a spoon and burn your tongue?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cI told Rani. About the final. She said if you don\u2019t win she\u2019s going to unfollow the show on principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell her not to. The show needs all the love it can get,\u201d I said. \u201cIt spends too much money on bunting to be sustainable.\u201d\n\nAfter she had gone to draw in her room, leaving a sea of pens that would leak on my conscience, I took the notebook and wrote another list: Who to tell\u2014Becks told, Mum told, maybe Marcus if he calls; what to bake for the neighbours so they forgive the camera crew; what to say if the judge asks me why I think I have a chance. Not because I\u2019m a soldier. Because I know how to stand up after a thing breaks and make the next one better. Because I know how to count to ten while sugar becomes thread. Because I know what saffron tastes like on a lucky day, and how to cheat when it isn\u2019t one.\n\nWhen Zoe and her two camera colleagues came on the Tuesday, Mrs. Devlin dressed like she was going to Ascot and waved from her doorway even though they were not filming her. \u201cNot today, Mrs. Devlin,\u201d Zoe said with a grin that said maybe tomorrow, not ruling it out. They made a film of me chopping pistachios and staring thoughtfully at my oven as if ovens have anything new to say. They filmed me tying my boots, and Ava leaned in a doorway and watched like she was memorising the angle of my fingers, which made me want to do it tidier.\n\n\u201cWhat was your hardest day,\u201d one of the camera lads asked, too quick, like he hadn\u2019t broken in his own shoes.\n\n\u201cIn what,\u201d I said. \u201cLife? Baking? It\u2019s all the same day.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say the tent,\u201d Zoe said softly, a glance passing between them. \u201cFor now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you ask my cake to be someone it isn\u2019t,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen you ask my cake to be polite. It\u2019s a terrible liar.\u201d\n\nThey laughed, and I warmed to the fact that they laughed. The mic on my shirt made my heart sound like a drum in my ear; it\u2019s disconcerting to listen to your own pulse, like being in a queue for something you\u2019re not sure you want. We did b-roll in the little market, me weighing out spices, talking to Mr. Patel about the saffron as if I was being filmed for a wildlife documentary and the spice was a rare bird. On the way back we passed the stadium at a distance where it looks like a spaceship has landed and the neighbours didn't complain. The arch in the winter light was the exact colour of new money. It made the sugar arch I\u2019d made look like an apology. Good. I needed the challenge.\n\n\u201cI want to get you with your daughter,\u201d Zoe said after a take where I said something trite about Wembley and then immediately regretted it. Even I could tell I sounded like a leaflet. \u201cJust a few lines. Nothing intrusive.\u201d\n\nAva came to stand beside me, and for a second our hips lined up the way they used to when she was shorter, and my heart did that flipbook thing where it remembers every age of her in one go. \u201cSo,\u201d Zoe said to her, \u201cwhat\u2019s your mum like in the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cA menace,\u201d Ava said neatly, and even Zoe laughed. \u201cShe burns her fingers and forgets to feed herself and sings really badly. But also\u2014she makes you think you can do anything because she makes cakes go in two directions at once. Like\u2014up and inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very pretty,\u201d Zoe said with honest admiration. \u201cYou have a writer.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has a girl who doesn\u2019t tell her when she\u2019s going to Rani\u2019s until she\u2019s already there,\u201d I said, and Ava bumped me with her shoulder.\n\n\u201cI left a note,\u201d she said. \u201cI left a note on the table.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d I said. \u201cIt was in your handwriting.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagine that,\u201d she said, drawling, and Zoe got her b-roll of us being humans.\n\nAfter they left, after the door shut and the house exhaled like you do when you hang up after a too-long call, it rained in the kind of gentle, unambitious way that makes London look like a film from the seventies. I made tea. I made the sugar arch again and failed twice more and then made one that was almost there. I thought about the boot camp in the rain when Staff had shouted at us with passion because our anger was a shield we could get rid of eventually. You can get used to anything, is both a threat and a comfort. Ava did her art homework and put a bus in the middle of our table and drew it with a hand that has decided to become precise. I told her it was good and she shrugged because compliments itch at this age.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re being weird,\u201d she said finally, not looking up from her page.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being me,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019re sensitive. You can tell when people are excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re excited,\u201d she said, and then the corner of her mouth did that thing again. \u201cDon\u2019t be excited like\u2014like it\u2019s the only thing. Be excited like it\u2019s one drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d I said. \u201cI can be a drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and smiled full on. It made her bright. It made her huge. I watched her and thought, I am very lucky. Even when it\u2019s hard, this is the good bit. I felt like this even when I woke at three a.m. and wrote half a page in my notebook about the way icing should be the thickness of a ribbon and then realised I had written it over a shopping list fully covering the word milk so I would forget to buy it in the morning.\n\nOn Thursday I took muffins to the drill hall and told Lewis that heroes polish their own trophies, and he laughed and said \u201cyes, Ma\u2019am,\u201d like he meant both halves of it. On Friday I called Marcus and said, \u201cAva has the school talent show next week\u2014do you want to come,\u201d and he said he\u2019d try but it was all the way from Manchester to Wembley and he had a meeting that might turn into drinks so he couldn\u2019t promise. On Saturday I called my auntie in Harrow and listened to her tell me what the judges like, as if she had a direct line into their sweet hearts. On Sunday I stood at my window and watched the stadium glint and thought, arched things are the city\u2019s love language. Bridges. Spans. Ellipses. The shape of a held breath.\n\nLater, after I burned the first batch of sable biscuits because I was answering a text and not watching the oven like a hawk, after Ava and I argued about nail polish that she swore she wouldn\u2019t wear to school and then did, after the neighbours yelled because the TV was too loud and then laughed and then apologised, I found the hole in the piping bag with my index finger and pressed it flat with tape and called that innovation. I asked the kitchen aloud, because kitchens keep secrets, \u201cAm I ridiculous.\u201d The kitchen did not answer, which was a relief. It means it has boundaries.\n\nIt is possible to love more than one thing. It is possible, as my uncle says while never admitting which football team he actually supports, to hold contradictions like they are groceries. You have to carry them carefully or the eggs break and then everything smells like something you can\u2019t get out. I love a parade square and I love a loaf tin. I love the noise at the end of our road when Brent wins anything and the quiet in the tent when a judge tastes the thing and doesn\u2019t speak for a second longer than you can endure. I love my kid. My fierce, bright, all-angles kid. And I am very good at pretending I am not frightened.\n\nThe night before the first final shoot day, I lined tins like it was a ritual my grandmother taught me, deliberate as prayer. I wrote a list that was partly ingredients and partly spells: saffron warmed with milk, pistachios hand-chopped because the processor bruises, sugar at hard crack, not soft, breathe. I put the boots by the door and looked at them like they were a decision. I took the sugar arch from its hiding place and held it lightly in both hands and walked across the kitchen with it like a person with another person sleeping on their chest. I placed it on the top tier dummy cake and it held for a breath, two, three.\n\nAva came out in her socks, a hoodie over pyjamas, and stood with her hands stuffed in her pocket like they were getting told off. \u201cYou ready,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d I said. \u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes because she is thirteen and she has artesian wells of disdain. And then, softer, like a coin in the bottom of a jar, \u201cI\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d I said. \u201cWell, now I\u2019ll cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me to make you one of those phone things. Like when you make a phone on Loud but not too Loud so you don\u2019t miss the alarm and also not the neighbours.\u201d\n\n\u201cA timer?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she said. \u201cThat.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake me one of those.\u201d\n\nShe set it on the counter with the complete seriousness of a mission. We both looked at it, phones glowing, the kitchen a little mess with promise. The city outside was awake and restless and not interested in our bit. I went to bed and lay awake and rehearsed breathing until the breathing happened on its own, and every time I thought of the sugar arch I forced myself to think of the ordinary arch: the one that keeps a roof from falling, the one your foot makes in a shoe, the one a hand makes when it holds something tender but not fragile.\n\nIn the morning the car pulled up at six and the runner with a jacket on a jacket knocked my door like he was apologising. \u201cMornin,\u201d he said, his eyes already too awake. \u201cReady for your close-up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI look like a person who has not slept,\u201d I said, and he grinned because everyone thinks that\u2019s charming on telly. In the kitchen, against the wall, the sugar arch waited. In the bedroom, Ava waited. She will be late to school by half an hour, and I will write a note that says family things, sorry, life. She slid her bag onto one shoulder and came to look at me in the hallway like I was going on a mission she packed, but couldn\u2019t follow on this one.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d she said, like a briefing. \u201cYou\u2019re good at this. You\u2019re not gonna apologise in your eyes all the time, okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make no promises,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d she said, because she\u2019s my commanding officer sometimes. \u201cAnd call me at lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said. \u201cAsk Mrs. Devlin to give you a lift if the bus is doing that thing again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bus is always doing that thing,\u201d she said, and then, soft again, that coin again, \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\n\u201cLove you more.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a competition,\u201d she said, smiling like the floor was absolutely safe. For now. For now, I held the image like a little candle cupped in my hands: her, my kitchen, a runner with a jacket on a jacket, the stadium half appearing through fog as we drove. The tent would be cold and full of bunting and a thousand small humiliations and glories. I would put butter in a bowl and make something rise.\n\nIf you ask me now what I thought would be the worst thing that could happen, I\u2019d tell you something to do with sugar temperature or a handshake withheld. It should be obvious. That life has other plans. But the novel I was living seemed to have one plot for once. Bake. Try not to swear. Remember to drink water. Remember to tell your daughter exactly where you are, minute by minute, even when she sighs.\n\nThe car turned left, and the tent came into view like a promise you can poke. You try not to jinx it. You do anyway. You step out. You carry your boots like a prop and your heart like a weight you\u2019re proud of. You check your phone for messages you already know aren\u2019t there yet. You walk forward. You think, I have never been more me. And for a minute or two, before the cameras find their angles, before the ovens decide who they like, it feels like that might be enough.",

                              "content": "The tent was colder than television admits. The air had that damp, polite chill of a church in March, a promise that heat would arrive eventually if you were devout enough with your body. Crew in black moved like crows with useful jobs. Bunting did what bunting does, which is stand in for joy so you don\u2019t have to provide it on cue. They put me at Station Seven, which felt both lucky and like a dare. Two to my left, a woman with a fringe like she\u2019d cut it in protest folded a tea towel like origami. To my right, a bloke with forearms that belonged on a builder ran his fingers over the dial of his oven as if he could romance it into good behaviour. I slipped my boots under the bench the way you put a hand under a spine you\u2019ve promised to hold. Zoe gave me a thumbs up from near a light and mouthed, \u201cBreathe,\u201d which made me laugh, and the laugh fogged the little window on my oven, which I took as a sign that the day was already tilted in my favour.\n\n\u201cIntroduce yourselves, then breathe,\u201d said the host whose jokes always sound like he\u2019s footnoting them. \u201cTell us your story without telling us your story. Tell us by pastry.\u201d\n\nSignature was first because the day has to start with something that looks a lot like hope. The brief was home in twelve hand pies, baked not fried because we are respectable and nobody trusts an oil vat in a tent with this many cables. \u201cGujiya,\u201d I told Zadie when she came to ask about my plan, because she always wants me to name things like a person who belongs at a naming. \u201cSemolina mawa, saffron milk, pistachio. I\u2019m brushing them with ghee and baking hot, so the seams set before they open their mouths to complain.\u201d\n\n\u201cHome in a crescent,\u201d she said, approving, because if you tell an English presenter a thing is home, they will smile even if it is a snake. \u201cHow many times have you made these?\u201d\n\nI held my hands apart as if a number could fit there. \u201cEnough to know when I\u2019m lying to myself,\u201d I said. \u201cNot enough to be bored.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and moved on to Builder Forearms, who was making hand pies that were actually Cornish pasties in a tux. He told a story about his Nana Eileen that made me want to call mine just to remind her I still existed.\n\nDough knows when you\u2019re tense. I said it out loud in my head and moved my shoulders down. Gujiya dough wants to be short without sulking. You cannot bully it. You coax it with just-warm ghee and milk that has looked a saucepan in the eye and decided not to boil. My fingers did the thing they do when flour and fat meet, that gentle snowing that turns into sand and then into a language you can half-remember. While the semolina toasted in more ghee than my mother would approve, I ground cardamom with sugar until the room remembered me. The smell did what I needed it to. The crew looked up. Someone near the end bench made a content noise without consent. I didn\u2019t grin, but my mouth thought about it.\n\n\u201cBoots,\u201d said the judge with the hair like a parfait, stopping at my station with that concerned kindness that reads well on camera. \u201cInteresting prop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re shoes,\u201d I said, because sometimes I can\u2019t help myself. \u201cThey keep my feet off the floor. They\u2019re also the only clean pair I had left.\u201d\n\nHe laughed as if I\u2019d blessed him. \u201cAnd this is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cGujiya,\u201d I said again, patient, like a sign language interpreter for a tourist. \u201cMy aunties pinch the seams tighter. I like them a little rustic because that\u2019s truth.\u201d\n\nMireille slid in beside him in a cloud of citrus perfume and mercy that she keeps hidden. \u201cCardamom,\u201d she said, stealing a breath that wasn\u2019t hers. \u201cGood choice. Many people panic and go cinnamon as if they are sending a postcard to a spice rack. What fat.\u201d\n\n\u201cGhee,\u201d I said. \u201cBrushed. Not drowned.\u201d\n\nShe gave me a look I could have used as a measuring spoon. \u201cDo not be cautious to the point of sorrow,\u201d she said and moved on, leaving me newly terrified of both restraint and excess, which is an achievement I might frame.\n\nI filled the little moons with the mawa mixture, tightened the seams with a pinch-and-twist my hands remembered before my head did, and set them in neat rows like soldiers who have decided for once to be kind. Ghee brushed on, the gold you earn in a pan sliding into their shoulder blades. Into the oven, hot, crowded, a prayer of sugar under my breath. Around me, puff and chant and panic. Builder Forearms swore gently because one of his pasties had mouthed off and opened. Fringe folded her towel again as if she could solve the concept of time with corners. Cameras lurked like cats that had graduated from hunting sparrows to details.\n\nWhen they came out, mine were more bronze than I\u2019d planned, which meant the bottom heat was closer to hell than heaven. I moved them to the rack like I was disarming something, tapped the underside of one with a fingernail, listened for crisp, and almost cried from relief at the sound. Piping a little saffron glaze felt like vandalism until the scent came up and told me I\u2019d done the right thing.\n\n\u201cTwelve,\u201d said Zadie, counting unnecessarily because the point of this part is that we can count. \u201cThey look like my grandmother\u2019s earrings.\u201d\n\n\u201cMine would bite you,\u201d I said, and she laughed again and I wanted, as I often do in this tent, to be less charming and more prepared.\n\nJudging is a theatre where your face must be both brave and soft, where you must stand still and let people talk about your work as if it happened without your hands. They sliced. The sound made my lungs more useful. Parfait Hair said, \u201cWell-crimped, generous filling,\u201d and I tried not to look like a dog who has been told he is good. Mireille took a bite and did that thing where she doesn\u2019t show you the thought until she\u2019s sure it will live. \u201cYou have a heavy hand with cardamom,\u201d she said, and my heart sank, and then she said, \u201cand God bless you for it,\u201d and my heart stood back up, saluted, and went for a jog. \u201cThe semolina is toasted properly. There is no raw squeak. The ghee is shy. Don\u2019t make me sad in the mouth. But. You have brought something of yourself and not tried to translate it out of its clothes. It is a good first page.\u201d\n\nWhen you have had other adults tell you for years how to be and not be, to have one say \u201cgood first page\u201d hits like water after a long exercise with a dry canteen. I put my hands behind my back so I wouldn\u2019t reach out and feed her another one, which is apparently frowned upon.\n\nThe technical was a slap from the universe hiding behind a twisty ribbon. \u201cParis-Brests,\u201d the host read with glee from a card he could have used as a roof tile. \u201cBut mini, and made with a pralin\u00e9 you will all claim to have known how to make since birth.\u201d We turned our papers over and found only a paragraph in a font smirking at us. Choux doesn\u2019t care about your ego. Choux cares if you have understood that four elements can be one if you pay attention for exactly the right length of time. I set water and butter to simmer like I was starting a romance, sieved flour as if my sieve had offended me, and worked with a wooden spoon until the paste was glossy enough to play itself in a music video.\n\nPiping rings is a study in humility. Mine were even, which is not a thing I say out loud often, and they baked to a stand that made me remember why I love a discipline with rules and then, under the rules, more rules you discover like a secret room. Pralin\u00e9 wanted to scorch, then to sulk, then to become silk and let me believe in it again. I cracked the caramel at exactly the point where it wanted to be a blade and caught it with hazelnuts that knew me better than most people. When you make something so good your eyes widen even alone, you think about who you\u2019ll hand it to first. In the tent, it\u2019s a camera. It\u2019s also Mira, a girl from Tottenham with a laugh like hands clapping, and Len, who told me he came to baking because scaffolding got old and cake did not.\n\nThe technical judging is blind only in the way a parent is blind at a school performance where your kid is dressed as a planet. Everyone knows the handwriting. Mine were nearer the front than I deserved, and when they said second I adopted the face of a person who had expected third and been promoted through no fault of their own. The camera loved it. The camera always loves slightly damp restraint. I had to force myself not to look for Ava in the crew, as if she\u2019d snuck in between lighting stands with a hoodie and a smug expression and a text that said you see.\n\nAt lunch I rang her, the runner guarding me like a polite elk. \u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d she said, and I could hear the bus sulking in the background and someone playing drill on a phone they weren\u2019t meant to have at school.\n\n\u201cAlive and sugared,\u201d I said. \u201cGujiya landed. Technical didn\u2019t kill me. How\u2019s your day?\u201d\n\n\u201cArt teacher cried at a slideshow,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the photos of classes from 1998 to now made her spiral. She\u2019s fine. Mrs. Devlin says the lift is being odd, like a child. Be proud of me for eating an apple.\u201d\n\n\u201cFlamboyantly proud,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll be late. I\u2019ll leave a note on the table because I am a woman of my word.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut it under the pigeon,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd Mum\u2026 good luck with the showstopper tomorrow. Don\u2019t put a whole stadium on a cake. That\u2019s extra.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I put a pretend bit of a stadium.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen that\u2019s not extra,\u201d she said solemnly. \u201cThat\u2019s artistic.\u201d\n\nWe hung up on a shared eye-roll, which is a family tradition. I stood with a cup of tea that tasted like it had been made in 1953 and looked at the tent as if it had secrets I could mine. Day One was a rehearsal for a feeling. Day Two was when you tried to make the feeling stand up on its own legs and walk around.\n\nAfter lunch we filmed the bits where you pretend you\u2019re seeing the tent for the first time. The hosts did a bit where they attempted to carry a cake like a baby and almost dropped it, and the sound engineer made a noise like he\u2019d seen God die. We all laughed because solidarity looks good on us. Zoe came to me with a quick whisper about the morning call sheet and the sugar temperatures and the crew being on my side because cameras like anyone who understands that patience is a substance.\n\nThe day ate itself the way filming days do. We did interviews in a corner where bunting looked bored. \u201cWhat does it mean to be here,\u201d the camera asked in a voice that had been trained to sound like your aunt. \u201cIt means work looks like love in better lighting,\u201d I said, which was almost the truth. I said a softer thing about Wembley and my mum and saffron, because TV likes saffron, and imagined Mr. Patel nodding like an uncle who had sponsored my speech.\n\nWhen I got home, I wrote a shopping list for the morning that looked like an apology to all the ingredients I had ever misjudged. I sharpened my small palette knife the way other people sharpen knives with real purpose. I tucked the sugar arch under a clean tea towel as if I could protect it from physics. Ava and I ate pasta like a team requiring carbs and watched a clip of a documentary about women in uniform that made her say, \u201cYou look better than them,\u201d with a seriousness that could buy a house. \u201cThey look like they haven\u2019t slept in three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree and a half,\u201d I said. \u201cBed,\u201d and she made a long show of announcing that being told to go to bed is an injustice that should make the papers. After she shut her door, I took my boots and wiped them down again, minding the mud from Salisbury that won\u2019t respect removal, and set them by the door next to the bag with the emergency repair kit that contains more than it should\u2014spare spatulas, spirit level, cocktail sticks, sugar thermometer, ribbon, tape, a charm my mother thinks is a charm.\n\nMorning smelled like toast and fear. The runner had less jacket this time, which meant it might rain. The car cut through fog that made hedges look like old men. The tent rose out of the pallor like a ship with bunting, which is just a tall story. They sent us into hair and makeup with a speed that made me think someone had found a stray hair in the batter of the world. Mireille wore a coat the shade of a plum that has given up. Parfait Hair had clearly slept with better pillows than the rest of us. The hosts were matching in a way that was either planned or fate twisting our ankles for fun.\n\n\u201cShowstopper,\u201d Zadie said in a tone you could stand a chair on. \u201cWe want something that cannot be ignored. We want a piece of you. We want structural integrity with emotional notes. We want you to reference London in form and flavour. We want the nation to argue about it on social media without being too mean. You have five hours. Off you go.\u201d\n\nThe bench became a battlefield I knew how to walk. My saffron sponges went in early like good soldiers and came out flat enough to stack without swearing but with enough lift that we would not have to fake the word sponge later. Pistachio crunch melted into a minor disaster and became, with the intervention of butter and profanity, something that would snap under a tooth without breaking a crown. The city\u2019s colours were in everything if you knew where to look\u2014crimson from pomegranate jewels in a syrup I reduced until it told me to stop, gold from saffron that had been warmed in milk and made to tell its stories, green from nuts that stained my fingers like the week does.\n\nAnd then there was sugar.\n\nThe arch is a question you ask sugar while it is in the mood to answer. You have to catch it between states, when it is a conversation and not a verdict. I heated it to hard crack like I had all my life, which is to say three times in a tent and a few times in a kitchen where the extractor fan thinks it is a politician. The first pull was too coy. The second broke in a gesture that would have been an insult if it were human. The third found a music in my hands that I had to honour by not getting clever. I laid it along a mould I\u2019d made from the inside of a tubing the crew had loaned me and said thank you to an inanimate object and meant it. My fingers found the burn at the edge of the middle joint and accepted it like currency. I used up all my good words saying, \u201cSoft,\u201d to myself and, \u201cNow,\u201d and, \u201cNot yet.\u201d When it held its shape with that defiant curve, I made the mistake of liking it too much and had to put it down and walk away for two full breaths so the universe would not be tempted to punish me for hubris.\n\nAround me, collapses in miniature and triumphs in secret. Len\u2019s tower learned about gravity and then forgot again thanks to skewers hidden like a crime. Mira decorated with a steady hand and a pink the exact shade of a lot of girls\u2019 bedrooms in the nineties. Fringe swore under her breath in a language I couldn\u2019t place but understood. Parfait Hair loitered like a benevolent vulture. Mireille was nowhere and everywhere, a perfume trail and a sudden voice at your elbow saying, \u201cThat ribbon is too much,\u201d and moving on as you reconsidered your whole relationship with ribbons.\n\nAt one point a host put his elbow on my bench and said, \u201cWembley, eh?\u201d and I said, \u201cYou\u2019d think I could ignore it,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou can ignore a lot of things. We prefer if you don\u2019t ignore the clock,\u201d and we both looked up at a number that meant different things to different hearts.\n\nIt happened as I was painting a last thin line of saffron glaze along the edge of the top tier, the way you underline a word in a letter to yourself. My phone, which I had surrendered to the runner like a contraband I wanted back later, reappeared in Zoe\u2019s hand. She didn\u2019t go to anyone else. She came straight for me, her gentle voice set aside like an apron she couldn\u2019t wear right now. \u201cLila,\u201d she said, and my body knew something my brain hadn\u2019t caught yet. \u201cSchool called. They say it\u2019s not\u2014sorry\u2014they say it\u2019s not an emergency emergency. But they want you to call.\u201d\n\nYou build a life where you can translate tone faster than words. My hands did the thing where they put something down so carefully it might as well be love, and my face did the thing where a smile slides from the edges inwards and sets. \u201cWho?\u201d I said, though I knew. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeputy Head,\u201d she said. \u201cAva left at lunch and didn\u2019t go to the next two classes. They\u2019re doing attendance now. They think she walked out with a friend. They\u2019ve tried her phone. It goes to voicemail. They know you\u2019re here. They wanted to say they\u2019re not panicking. And they are sorry. And would you call.\u201d\n\nThe sugar arch looked like a solution to a different problem, which is to say it was very beautiful and very useless. Mireille somewhere behind me said something in a bright tone to someone whose ganache had split, and the sound felt like it came down a tunnel. Zoe\u2019s hand hovered like she wanted to touch my arm and had filed the desire as unprofessional. The timer said an hour and twenty left, which is both a whole life and no time at all.\n\nI took the phone and stepped away from my bench, which is a treachery in a showstopper and also the only thing to do. Outside, the light was that mean winter brightness that makes you squint at even your own intentions. The grass had given up its green for the day and lay there like a carpet no one could afford. I walked behind the tent where the smokers go to pretend they\u2019re having a crisis and the producers go to pretend they can fix it. I dialled with a thumb that knew its job and listened to the deputy head tell me carefully that children run from things and to things and sometimes just out of rooms because there is a world the size of a shoe box in their chest and it needs air.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re checking the usual places,\u201d she said, and her voice was the voice of a woman who has said too many times, nothing is wrong until it really is. \u201cRani\u2019s. The library. The park. We have a supervisor in a car doing the loop. If you\u2019re happy, I can nip to yours. Mrs. Devlin is on our list. She is on all the lists. She is, I must say, a formidable woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cCheck the roof of the shopping centre,\u201d I said, because I know where the kids go when they want sky but not questions. \u201cShe\u2019s not a jumper. She just likes the wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the woman said, and I understood that she was not picturing wind. \u201cDo you want us to call her father.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said, which is a lie you tell because it gives you a job. \u201cIf she comes back in, if she texts, if you even think you see her shadow, call me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is a good child. This is a\u2014blip.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren are blips,\u201d I said, and we both took comfort from the thought that this was a normal misbehaviour and not a substitution for the terror we keep under the stairs. I hung up and for a second, exactly one, I pressed my forehead to the cold white of the tent wall like I could download steadiness from canvas.\n\nZoe appeared around the corner but stayed out of my orbit in a way that made me want to go to her and also keep the distance for the sake of not breaking. \u201cWe can stop,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can pause you. We can\u2014what do you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to be two people,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to be inside standing sugar up and outside standing outside my child\u2019s head. I want to know what she is thinking when she closes a door. I want to be un-filmed. I want to stand in my kitchen and make dal and wait for the key in the lock that means ordinary. I also want to finish this and not be the woman who went out with a cry. I want too much.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t say that was human. She didn\u2019t tell me to be brave. She did a thing I will carry with me which is that she looked at my face and then at my hands and then at the grass and said, \u201cWhat do you need, right now,\u201d as if the present can be sliced into pieces you can eat without choking.\n\n\u201cI need to call Mrs. Devlin,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd Rani\u2019s mum. And my mother. And I need to tell someone at the school that she left a note on the fridge that says where she\u2019s gone when she actually does, because I am a fool who thinks thirteen is a rational number.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen call,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be horrible and time you, because the cake does not stop being cake simply because life has cracked its knuckles. I will come and get you if something changes. I will station a runner at your kitchen if you want. I will, at the very least, make tea that doesn\u2019t taste like sadness.\u201d\n\nThe calls were what they always are in a crisis that is not a crisis yet. Mrs. Devlin had seen her at eight with a hoodie and a grin and then had not. \u201cShe had that fizz,\u201d she said, and I could hear the horses on the radio doing their slow thunder. \u201cShe will come back even if she goes out. That girl is a boomerang.\u201d\n\nRani\u2019s mum thought she was at mine, which meant the girls had done the thing where they covered each other like soldiers in a story. My mother said a prayer out loud in the kitchen in a voice that made me seventeen and the worst. Marcus\u2019s phone went to voicemail where he was in love with his own competence. I left a message that was clean, because you don\u2019t put panic on tape if you can help it.\n\nWhen I went back into the tent my hands were steady in a way that made me suspicious. My bench smelled like I had not left. The sugar arch had developed an audible opinion about my absence by cracking along the least forgiving line, right at the shoulder where the pretend strain becomes a real one. I stood there and did not swear because someone\u2019s mother was watching. I picked it up as if it had always been like that and the crack was part of its history. I took my emergency ribbon and made it into a design choice. I did the thing you do in barracks and kitchens and the middle of the High Road when a bus has splashed water up your entire leg. I pretended that this was the plan.\n\nLen caught my eye and nodded like a man who has put more things back together than he broke. Mira mouthed something that could have been you got this or breathe or both. Fringe offered me a spare dowel like a candlestick in a blackout. Zadie came by and lifted an eyebrow at the ribbon and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s couture,\u201d and she said, \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor,\u201d and we both laughed as if we could see the book jacket.\n\nWhen the judges came for the final walk and the cameras held their breath and the hosts leaned in like gossipers, the arch held. It was not the arch of my dream. It was the arch of a city that knows scaffolding. It was patched and pretty and mine. Parfait Hair did the thing with his hand where he measures without measuring and said, \u201cAmbitious,\u201d and I didn\u2019t apologise with my eyes. Mireille tapped the ribbon like a teacher tapping a note and then cut through to the crumb. She ate. She was quiet for the length of a small prayer. \u201cBalance,\u201d she said finally, and I could breathe because she had used the word I\u2019d written in my notebook as if that had summoned it. \u201cThe saffron knows its place. The cardamom is not showy here. The pistachio comes in as a soft crunch in the second sentence. The icing is a touch thick. Do not think your sugar work is the story when the cake speaks this way. But you wanted to be remembered. And you will be.\u201d\n\nThe cameras saw me swallow hard, and I let them. I pictured Ava with wind in her hair on the roof of the shopping centre eating a packet of crisps she was too proud to buy herself. I imagined the deputy head\u2019s little car doing loops as if Wembley was a question that could be answered by laps. I wondered if children know that their mothers hold a bass line of terror under all the melody. I smiled a smile that my mother would recognise as the smile I used when I had lied about washing my hands. I told myself I would have news by the time I took the mic off my collar and put my boots back on. I told myself that life can be both kind and late. I told myself a story in which a sugar arch breaks and a girl does not.",

The tent hummed with the relief of ovens exhaling and bowls stacked in forgiveness. We were five across, ribbons and mends and heroics disguised as piping. Zadie did her bit about journeys and redemption arcs with the light touch of a person who knows a story only makes sense when food is involved. I kept my eyes on the white seam where the floor runner met the mat and pretended I was checking for trip hazards instead of trying not to guess what my child\u2019s feet were doing in a school corridor or on a pavement, city-wet and lit by the kind of winter noon that never commits to being day.\n\nThey did that thing where the hosts prolong a sentence because time is a toy in here. Parfait Hair arranged his mouth to look like good news and bad wisdom. Mireille stood with her hands in a way that said she had already made the decision and would be fair to you about it even if the decision hurt. \u201cIn third,\u201d they said, and the name that wasn\u2019t mine flared and softened, applause doing what it does when relief and charity marry. \u201cIn second,\u201d they said, and a heart near me unclenched, and I realised it was one of mine, the one that does logistics. When Zadie smiled at me with a kind of glee I recognised from a hundred kitchen victories and somebody squeezed my shoulder with a hand that smelled faintly of hazelnut paste, the noise in the tent was both an explosion and contained. They said my name as if I\u2019d been that word all along. A ribbon of something ran through me that tasted like electricity and saffron milk.\n\nFaces came at me fast, congratulation a weather system you can\u2019t hold off with an umbrella. The cake stand they put in my hands was heavier than I\u2019d expected, which felt right. My boots were under the bench behaving like props and obligations. Confetti that wasn\u2019t confetti drifted, crumbs of something that had been snapped for a close-up. I wanted to grin like an idiot because I had made a thing with my hands and it had not fallen and people who have eaten a great deal of cake said it was good. I also wanted to walk directly through the canvas and keep walking until I could see my child\u2019s breath on cold air and hear her say, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d in the tone that means she hasn\u2019t learned yet that the word fine is a bandage, not a cure.\n\nSomeone handed me a bouquet as if flowers are the correct translation for a woman\u2019s effort. I took them because manners are stitched into me like bias binding. A cheer went up that I would never trust in a street but did here because bunting asked me to. I found Zoe\u2019s face in the crowd and searched it like a sign. She gave me the smallest nod a person can give without their head falling off, which meant nothing immediate had happened and also that something had. The bass line of terror I have carried since pregnancy hiccuped and then kept time. I let them mic me for the bit where you say something about what it means. I said words that sounded like the inside of the tent and not like my kitchen; I said Mum and Wembley and Ava, and the nation was meant to feel something warm. In the space in my tongue I didn\u2019t use, I repeated a small prayer I learned from listening to two religions and a football commentary.\n\nAfter, they wanted shots of me pretending to walk in fresh and me holding the cake stand like a baby again and me laughing with a cousin I don\u2019t have. The crew does kindness as choreography: they kept the cameras at a polite distance while everyone touched my arm as if I might vanish. Mira hugged me and said, \u201cYou absolute beast,\u201d into my hair. Len told me he would have bet money and then shook his head as if gambling on joy is rude. The hosts did a bit about the trophy being harder to bake than a souffl\u00e9 and I made a noise like agreement because there\u2019s a timber to a day like this where you can\u2019t afford to be a bad instrument.\n\nWhen they let me go to a corner and breathe for twenty-two seconds, I took my phone back from Zoe and saw nothing from Ava, no tiny cartoon rectangles that could have been any combination of reassurance and sarcasm. Mrs. Devlin had texted me three times in her punctuation-free abandon: LILA LOVE did not see HER YET LIFT MAN SAYS SAW TWO GIRLS WITH BAGS ON THE STAIRS LAUGHING I SHOUTED NOT TO RUN. Then: MADE HER BISCUITS IN CASE. Then: DO NOT WORRY DOES NOTHING BUT AGE YOU. Mr. Patel had sent a voice note I couldn\u2019t make out in the noise; it probably contained both advice about saffron and an instruction to check the bus stop opposite the off-license where the drivers wink when it rains.\n\nMy mother had called twice and hung up before voicemail because she cannot bear the idea of her voice in a machine that will not argue back. A message from the deputy head was patient and contained the phrase \u201cno further information as yet,\u201d which is the kind of sentence that makes me want to punch clouds. A number I didn\u2019t recognise had sent a single photo of two trainers at the top of the shopping centre car park stairs, one with a ripped lace. The caption said, Is this your girl's? and then, sorry maybe not, hard to tell from shoes. I stared at it until the trainers dissolved into two halves of a thing that is not a person.\n\n\u201cLila,\u201d Zoe said, soft in the way you use for doors that slam if you push them too hard. \u201cThey want a sit-down with you and the judge. Ten minutes. Then we can get you out of here. I\u2019ve got a car on hold that goes wherever you tell it to. We\u2019ve pinged a runner to your place to look for a note because your brain is in more than one place and that is allowed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say while sitting,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to put my face together without glue. Ten sounds like the right shape for a thing I can do.\u201d\n\nIn the interview corner with the bunting making an effort behind me and the cake stand placed so that it was in shot but not blocking the good light, Mireille sat opposite like a woman who has seen too many people mistake sugar for truth. Her hands were the kind you trust to take a piece from your plate and not steal anything else. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d she said with the calm of someone who knows the currency of the word and does not overspend. \u201cYou kept balance. You did not let your story make your cake lazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, keeping my back where Staff would approve. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, isn\u2019t it. The way a thing can be both the most important thing and not at all.\u201d\n\nShe watched me the way you watch a saucepan that might boil and might not. \u201cThey told me,\u201d she said, her accent turning told into two syllables like a gift, \u201cabout your daughter walking out of school. I am not a mother. I am an aunt twelve times. My sister says her heart has one job when it is not doing the other jobs. It makes dread into a rhythm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy heart has been a drummer for months,\u201d I said. \u201cSometimes it feels like it\u2019s showing off.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be quick,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you will go and you will either find her standing with a face that says she wants to be told off and held at the same time, or you will find that she has been in a place where phones do not reach. Either way you will make dal that is either simple or full of too many things and you will both eat it.\u201d\n\nShe asked me then a question about saffron and signals and I answered in my public voice, which is a low-key version of my real one. We skated over the bit where being seen as a soldier in a kitchen makes people talk to you like you might explode. We laughed at a joke about bunting. We did ten minutes and then the sound engineer unhooked me with the gentleness of someone taking a tag off new clothes.\n\nOutside, the daylight was that tinny colour that makes you doubt whether the sun has a say. The car they\u2019d put me into smelled like someone else\u2019s mint. The driver asked for an address and I said, \u201cWe will do a loop,\u201d and gave him a map made of feelings. We tried the shopping centre roof, where the wind has opinions and the kids look out at a view that tricks you into thinking it is a horizon and not a collection of car parks. A security guard with a badge that claimed he was Leonard but a face that said he\u2019d answer to anything shook his head kindly. \u201cSaw two girls earlier,\u201d he said, stowing his hands in his jacket like tools. \u201cLaughing in the way you remember. One had those fancy plaits that aren\u2019t for PE. They went down the stairs when I did the voice. The voice works on the small ones. The bigger ones need something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe voice hardly works on mine,\u201d I said. \u201cThank you. If you see her, tell her her mother is doing the Voice with extra reverb.\u201d\n\nHe grinned as if he believed he might be in a story now. We did the footbridge that looks like a place spies rendezvous in films with a lower budget. We did the bus stops where the gum has a sociology degree. We did Barham Park where the geese had called a second meeting and were voting on socialism. I texted Rani\u2019s mum again and she texted back a photo of her own kitchen where six girls have spent the last month eating toast like they were being paid and a note that said, Not since lunch, I promise, I would not lie about this if she was under the table.\n\nThe runner Zoe had sent called as we rolled past the arches of the stadium in a light that made it self-conscious. \u201cI\u2019m in your kitchen,\u201d she said, apologetic and brisk. \u201cYou have a very characterful drawer. There is a note under the pigeon magnet. It says, Mum\u2014went to draw\u2014don\u2019t be mad\u2014phone 3%. Back for tea. X.\u201d She read the address as if it were one she\u2019d memorised for a game: the little wall by the canal path near where the river pretends it is still a river and a girl can pretend the city is not a machine.\n\n\u201cOf course she went to draw,\u201d I said to the car ceiling because it was the only surface I could look at that did not make me throttle myself. \u201cOf course she went to find an arch I cannot touch.\u201d\n\nThe stretch by the canal is a sly strip of water that insists on being a story even while shopping trolleys lean in it at angles. In winter the willows fuss and the joggers suffer it and the foxes do their rounds like landlords. We found her where the note said, which made me want to be angry and made me a little proud, because this is how you teach a person that you can be trusted: you tell them, and then you are where you said you would be.\n\nShe was sitting on the little wall with her knees up, trainer laces properly tied because however much she tries to be a revolutionary she has my mother in her bones. Her hood was up against a mist that wasn\u2019t really rain. A sketchbook sprawled on her lap like something asleep. Her phone lay face down next to her in that posture of dead batteries. She was not crying. She was making a face at the arch in the distance like the arch had a personality and it was showing off.\n\nI didn\u2019t call her name like a siren. I walked the last ten steps quietly the way you approach an animal that will come if you do not announce you want it to. When she felt me, her shoulders did the exact thing mine do when someone you love puts a hand there. It is a sort of dropping that still holds you upright. She didn\u2019t turn right away, which in my head will always be the split second where I am both saved and not. Then she turned, slow as a person waking up on a sofa when the film credits are already rolling.\n\n\u201cMum,\u201d she said, and the word was teenage and infant and a new country\u2019s anthem. \u201cDon\u2019t be, like\u2014mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have just been on television,\u201d I said, sitting down next to her because my legs had decided against standing. \u201cThere is nothing left in me that isn\u2019t already using its hands to stay upright.\u201d\n\nShe looked at my face closely in the way children do before they decide which mood they\u2019re dealing with. \u201cDid you win,\u201d she asked, casual as a movie star ordering fries.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d I said, and the words were heavy with a glitter I had not yet accounted for. \u201cI did, and then I did not know where you were.\u201d\n\nHer mouth moved like she was rearranging words into an apology and a defence. \u201cI left a note,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI know I should have asked. But they would have said no because it\u2019s school, and Mr. Hampton\u2019s slideshow gave me that feeling. The one where you have to get air, except not just air, like\u2014air that knows your name. And I wanted to draw it when it doesn\u2019t feel like a stadium. When it feels like a spaceship that might go if you are nice to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAir is a resource,\u201d I said, which is the kind of sentence you should never say to a child, so I stopped and tried again. \u201cYou made me scared. You made other people get in cars and look for you. You made a deputy head say phrases she has saved for special occasions. You made Mrs. Devlin put lipstick on to sit by the lift in case you came by. And you came here and made a drawing that will be better with a biscuit.\u201d\n\nHer eyes flicked up and then down with the speed of a guilt-bird. \u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought you were in your zone. I thought telly people would look after you and you wouldn\u2019t notice I wasn\u2019t in my small zone. I\u2019m sorry. I am. I didn\u2019t think you would be\u2014like\u2014counting breaths.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is my whole hobby,\u201d I said. \u201cI count breaths like other people collect stamps. Show me your drawing.\u201d\n\nShe unfolded the book like paper wanted to be kind. The arch on the page was not perfect; it was better. It had a tiny crack in it, a deliberate scar along one curve where she had pressed harder because a bus had gone by and her elbow had gone with it. She had drawn the bunting from memory in the negative space, which is something I could not have thought to do. There was a fox in the corner with a crown that looked borrowed from a biscuit tin. There were two pairs of boots by a radiator if you looked long enough.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very good,\u201d I said, which is never enough and always true. \u201cI thought you might be on the shopping centre roof being an existentialist.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did that last week,\u201d she said, deadpan. \u201cMum. You\u2019re actually not cross?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m furious and grateful,\u201d I said. \u201cThey are two arms of the same person. You will come back with me. You will let Mrs. Devlin tell you about the time her son moved to America in a van and you will act impressed. You will call the deputy head and say the words whose letters spell out accountability. You will eat dal that is simple because I do not have the energy to put in all the things. And later I will decide what punishment looks like, which will probably be boring, like chores and a talk about trust that we will both survive.\u201d\n\nShe nodded like this was both fair and theatrical. \u201cI can do that,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you going to cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cried at saffron earlier,\u201d I said. \u201cI am an indiscriminate hydrant. Also, I burnt my finger in the name of art and I want it to have been for something.\u201d\n\nShe bumped me with a shoulder like a punctuation mark. \u201cIt was for a thing,\u201d she said brightly. \u201cIt was for Winning Baking Television.\u201d\n\nWe sat for a few minutes with the water doing its cheap impression of a river and the stadium looking like a promise you could move in under. A man on a bike with a milk crate strapped to the front passed and nodded as if we were on his route and must be acknowledged. A bus hissed somewhere in a way that always sounds like displeasure. The fox we had both been expecting sauntered into view, sniffed our toes with the intimacy of a relative, and moved on because we had no sandwiches and nothing interesting to gossip.\n\nOn the way back, the car\u2019s heater did the tiny miracle it does when it turns your fingers back into animals that can manipulate zips. Ava flicked her dead phone on and off like a ritual and declared it \u201ctraumatic.\u201d I texted Zoe a single sentence that turned my inside into a report: Found her at canal, alive, sorry, thank you. She replied with a heart and the dangerous sentence, We have time for a last shot if you want it, which I read and did not resent. Life doing its overlap will always look like audacity from some angles.\n\nAt the flat, the runner on my sofa sprang up as if I were an inspector. She had washed a mug and put it upside down to dry and I wanted to give her an award. The note sat under the pigeon magnet looking innocent. Mrs. Devlin was in the hallway holding a tin like it was a bible and wearing a cardigan that had seen things. \u201cFound her,\u201d she announced to the building as if she were parliament. \u201cI told all of you and none of you and you\u2019re welcome. Ava, come here and accept the judgement of the block, which is to say a biscuit and a two-minute talk on respect.\u201d\n\nAva folded herself into Mrs. Devlin\u2019s one-arm hug and came away dusted with sugar and stories. Mr. Patel\u2019s voice note, when I finally played it, was a minute of musings on whether saffron should be warmed by candle to keep it humble, punctuated by, I heard something, do not worry, the city is at its nicest when it is pretending to be difficult. Becks texted a photo of the range at the drill hall covered in my muffins with the caption, Stop crying or I\u2019ll make you do sixty, and another that was just, Proud of you, idiot, with a heart that looked like it had gone to a boot camp.\n\nThe deputy head picked up on the first ring and did that professional lowering of tone that makes you want to pass an exam. \u201cShe is home,\u201d I said, and she exhaled as if she had been holding air at a polite volume. We did the apologies; they were good ones, full of nouns. We made a plan involving detentions that do not break a child but make her consider the usefulness of chairs. I promised to talk to Ava not like a judge but like a woman with groceries. She told me she liked my semifinal and then pretended she had not said it, as if praise might be confiscated.\n\nZoe wanted one more shot of us on the stairs, the little domestic theatre where a mother\u2019s boots sit and a child\u2019s trainers tell on her. We did it because the day was already a mosaic and one more tile wouldn\u2019t kill us. Ava managed not to pull a face at the lens and to tuck her hair behind her ear in a way that I knew meant she felt beautiful and did not want to admit it. I put the cake stand on the table with its scorch marks and it looked right there, not on the plinth in the tent with light thinking it could be the sun. They filmed me washing my hands and drying them on the tea towel and I felt like a person who can choose what parts of herself to lend and what to keep at home with the socks that don\u2019t match.\n\nWhen they left, when the door shut and the block returned to its default settings of kids on scooters and someone\u2019s telly arguing with the sky, I stood with my palms flat on the laminate and let the ordinary come back in like a tide. The sugar arch we had not transported lay on the sideboard with its ribbon like a bandage that decided to stay on because it looked good. Ava put her drawing beside it and the two arches regarded each other with the kind of respect only two things with spines have. I made dal that was simple and I burnt the first tempering because I was not watching, and there are worse sins.\n\nOver bowls, Ava asked me what the judges said and I told her the bit about balance and the bit about not letting my story make my cake lazy, and she said, \u201cInteresting,\u201d with more sincerity than sarcasm. We ate in the kind of silence that is friendship and then we started talking at the same time and then we both said, \u201cNo, you,\u201d like a game, which is disgusting and I hope we never stop. Later, when she had done her ten minutes of detention work at the kitchen table in advance because she likes to pretend she\u2019s a lawyer pre-pleading, she went to her room humming something that might be the theme tune of a show I have never watched on purpose. I sat with the list I had written the night before\u2014ingredients and spells\u2014and added a line: Do not make the arch hold what it cannot. Teach it to share.\n\nThe phone rang, and this time it was Marcus with that triumphant tone of a man who has emerged from a meeting with his own name still attached. \u201cHeard the good news,\u201d he said without a hello, because he thinks entrances are for other people. \u201cMy boss\u2019s wife watches; I am a man of the people. Congratulations, Lila. Our girl okay? I had a missed call.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe decided to redefine lunch,\u201d I said. \u201cShe\u2019s home. She left a note and her phone died and I had to invent six new heartbeats. She will call you later and pretend it\u2019s all very normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cThirteen,\u201d he said, as if it were a diagnosis. \u201cI\u2019ll come down this weekend, yeah? Take her to the one with the pancakes. Watch her roll her eyes at me about everything from napkins to the existence of napkins.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be good,\u201d I said, because I am not cruel and because Ava loves him with a caveat and that caveat is not for anyone else to hold. \u201cAnd thanks.\u201d\n\nHe went into a bit about Manchester and cranes on the skyline and I let the words pass like traffic, nodding in the right places because this is a street we have driven down many times. When I hung up, the kitchen made that little settling sound it has when it\u2019s happy to be the place everything comes back to. I put the cake stand on the top of the fridge because that\u2019s where we keep things that mean something in case meaning can climb.\n\nThat night the muscle memory of show days kept me awake, the body unable to accept that it no longer needed to prove anything to ovens. I got up and wrote in my notebook about the way Mireille had said balance and how that word could be a plank and a scale and a trick on a wire. I added a line about breath counting and who taught me it and how many times my shoulders needed instruction before they learned their proper place. I drew a fox with a crown in the margin like I was twelve again and hoping a teacher would see it and decide I was interesting.\n\nIn the morning the estate had its hungover Monday voice. The lift did its sigh like an old auntie. The bus brake hissed. Mrs. Devlin\u2019s radio told a horse to be good. Mr. Patel put the shutters up like a reveal. The stadium glinted as if it had been polished in the night by some patient giant. I laced my boots with the kind of care that is not anxiety but religion, and I put on my old service tee because it is soft and because sometimes you wear clothes that remind you that you have belonged to places that don\u2019t care what you bake.\n\nAva came out in a skirt she had not asked me about and a hoodie she had absolutely promised not to wear to school and did an about-turn when she saw my eyebrows. \u201cDetention today,\u201d she said, pre-emptively noble. \u201cI will be the picture of remorse in a room with a poster about adverbs. I will text you when I am sitting down in a chair and when I am standing up from the chair and when I have been released back into the general population.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will attempt to behave as if I do not require this level of detail,\u201d I said. \u201cI will fail. I will still function.\u201d\n\nShe kissed my cheek in that rapid way you do when you hope the affection outruns the embarrassment. \u201cProud of you,\u201d she said into my skin, and I would have baked a city for that. \u201cAnd also: the arch is better with the ribbon. Don\u2019t tell anyone I said that. They\u2019ll make me talk about metaphor in English.\u201d\n\nI let her go because parenting is, in the end, a practice in deliberate letting go with a hand ready just off-screen. When the door shut, the flat looked like a stage after a play has ended, props in their places, the smell of warm light lingering. I sat down with the list of things that come after a victory you don\u2019t yet have a box for: the press thing that might be nothing and might be a morning spent eating small pastries in a room where people talk too fast; the drill hall evening where Becks will make me run in a circle for reasons that will be explained and none of them will be good; the conversation with Mum about lipstick and hair and the way she will tell my auntie that I am on the telly and also that I am thin since last month and I must eat.\n\nI washed the sugar off the sideboard with hot water and the smell pulled the previous day back in like a tide. I thought about the way the producer had asked for a prop and how the boots had looked under that bench, patient and ridiculous. I thought about Mr. Patel saying the final is just the beginning and how sometimes beginnings look exactly like your kitchen with a tiny leak under the sink and a child who has wandered off and returned with a drawing that is better than the real thing. I thought about how, on Salisbury Plain, Staff used to stop us in the rain and tell us to put our shoulders down, like a spell, like a blessing, like a grammar for bodies that had forgotten their own syntax.\n\nWhen the post came through the door with its slap of inevitability, there was an envelope with the show\u2019s logo and a letter about the \u201cculmination\u201d of journeys and three vouchers for a kitchenware brand that thinks you have a second kitchen for display. There was also a leaflet for a youth thing at the temple, with a photo of a girl who was not my daughter but could have been. I stuck it on the fridge with the pigeon magnet and a bit of ribbon that had been holding an arch together and looked at the collage. Boots. Magnet. Ribbon. A girl\u2019s handwriting that said don\u2019t be mad. A city that insists on being arched. I breathed, which is a thing I am learning to do like a craft. I put saffron in milk to see if it would tell me something new. I let the morning happen without adding too much to it. I thought, today I will not be a story for anyone who isn\u2019t in this room.\n\nAt mid-morning, the drill hall text thread blew up with Becks\u2019s brand of affection disguised as orders. Parade square, 1800, bring your ridiculous trophy so I can fill it with Lucozade and tradition. Someone had photoshopped my face onto a queen with a piping bag scepter and the caption, All Hail, which made me snort and saved me from the quieter, heavier tears that keep appointments you didn\u2019t set. I sent a photo of the arch with its ribbon and captioned it: I did a mend. Becks replied, Picture of my ankle taped in 2012. Mends keep you in the game.\n\nA bell in the courtyard did its uncertain ring and I remembered the first bell of Ava\u2019s school, how it used to make me feel like a teenage version of myself was doing sit-ups in the attic. I made a tray of biscuits I could drop at Mrs. Devlin\u2019s because she likes to say she\u2019s not fussed and then be fussed in a way that keeps the building from becoming merely a structure. While they baked, I called Mum to let her do the thing where she pretends to criticise my choices to protect me from anyone else doing it.\n\n\u201cYour face on the telly,\u201d she said by way of greeting, like she had been waiting at a window. \u201cLike a peach. Like a paneer cut fresh. Did you wear the dusky lipstick. It was good, see, because then your eyes were not fighting your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cMum,\u201d I said, resting my chin on my wrist because some parts of me are twelve forever. \u201cIt happened. The winning. And her. The absence that filled the kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI called on God and also on Mrs. Gupta,\u201d she said, the hierarchy clear to her and not to me. \u201cBetween them they can move a bus. She is thirteen. Thirteen is an age I would like to put in a cupboard for a year and then take out when it has finished with its dramas. You did not tell me you were scared when you were thirteen. You were quiet as a rice pot on a low flame. I did not know if you were cooking or sulking. She will tell you, and then she will run to avoid the echo of her own words.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe left a note,\u201d I said. \u201cI keep thinking this means we are doing at least one thing right.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means you have built a house where notes make sense,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a great achievement. Bigger than your cake with the thing on top that looked like a bridge and a weapon. Come for lunch. I will make you fish because you forget you are a person with bones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll come,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ll bring Mrs. Devlin because she has been the building today.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring her,\u201d Mum said. \u201cI will not let her drink too much tea because she gets fast.\u201d\n\nI hung up and leaned on the counter in the way that means you have asked gravity to do some work for you. The biscuits made their tinny clatter onto the cooling rack. A van outside shouted something about fresh carpets. A child screamed the scream that means someone has denied him a second biscuit with totalitarian ferocity. The day had returned to its usual angle, which is to say slightly off, slightly galling, mostly fine.\n\nWhen Ava came home she did the penitent swagger that exists in all school corridors. She held a little green slip that said Detention Completed, which might be my favourite phrase I have ever read. She put it on the fridge with the pigeon magnet because she understands the archive of our lives. We took the biscuits upstairs to Mrs. Devlin and listened to the horse race and placed our bets on the names that sounded like aunties. We lost, because the universe prefers it when you do. We went to Mum\u2019s and did the jam between three generations thing where love turns into instructions and instructions turn into jokes and jokes turn into washing up. I let them talk about me as if I wasn\u2019t in the room, which is an art and a relief.\n\nLater, when it was dark and cold with that careful London reluctance to be dramatic, I walked to the drill hall with the trophy hidden under a shopping bag because I am allergic to being robbed of symbols. The hall smelled like oil and men who plan to get better at something and tea that rescues more lives than it is credited with. Becks saluted me in a way that would get us both told off and then pulled me into a hug that squared my shoulders for me. The lads cheered in a way that was ninety percent sincere and ten percent hoping I\u2019d bring biscuits again. I did the speech they made me do which was three sentences longer than it needed to be because you have to give them something to mock later. I told them I had patched a sugar arch with ribbon and a plan and I had won anyway, and one of the new recruits who had the eyes of a deer and the stance of a man who would one day own his skin said, \u201cIs that allowed,\u201d and Becks, from behind me, shouted, \u201cIt is when you\u2019re Rahman,\u201d as if my name were a certificate.\n\nOn the way home I walked past the stadium because I always do when there is something in me that needs explaining to itself. It was lit in a blue that tries to be expensive and often succeeds. The arch made its shape in a sky that was not ready for it. A fox came down the steps of a terrace like he\u2019d paid the mortgage and I bowed to him because I am not too proud to respect monarchy in forms that suit me. I thought about how many arches a day you walk under without noticing them, the ones made by your gait and your kitchen taps and the curve of the shoulder you sleep on. I thought about how show days are like judgements you survive, and real days are like training you come back for on purpose.\n\nAt the flat, Ava had done her homework and then drawn the bus braking the way she likes to, with speed lines and a faint halo. She had written Home in a way that wasn\u2019t a title so much as an instruction. I put the trophy on the table with the scorch marks and put the ribbon next to it and put the pigeon magnet in my pocket because the pigeon has done enough. Then I went to bed and told my brain in the voice of Staff that the day was over and the next day would arrive whether I practised or not. I slept in slices, as mothers do, and dreamed that sugar remembered me and did not hold a grudge. In the morning, the leak under the sink still asked for a bowl and the geese still had opinions and the dough still knew when I was tense and the rifle did too and I was, against my expectations, still a person who could hold all of that in one pair of hands.",

I kept catching sight of the cake stand on the top of the fridge and thinking it was a bowl I had left out of place, then remembering it was a symbol. Symbols make poor mixing bowls. They don\u2019t take kindly to being filled with batter. The embargo email from production came with congratulations wrapped in legalese, a smile with a hand firmly over its own mouth. We are thrilled you are thrilled, it said, and also please zip the feeling up until the broadcast, no exceptions, even if your aunties bully you. It listed fines that had too many zeros to seem real and a schedule of possible pick-up days for filming extra shots of me whisking as if I had only just discovered the concept.\n\nIt is one thing to keep news from strangers. It is another to look Mr. Patel in the eye when he says, \u201cSo, are we to rejoice or to wait,\u201d and say, \u201cWe are to wait.\u201d He did a little theatre of not caring and slid a mango into my bag with the secret handshake speed of a man who has accomplices everywhere. Mrs. Devlin did not believe in embargoes. She took me by the elbow by the lift and said, \u201cIs it you, is it, is it,\u201d with such intensity that I had to say, \u201cIt is what it is,\u201d and then she narrowed one eye like a pigeon and nodded as if I had confessed to stealing a horse.\n\nAva did her detention in a room with a poster of a mountain telling her the journey was the thing, and came home with a new gravity she wore for an hour and then misplaced because the cartoon on at six made her laugh in a way that loosened the screws on a day. The deputy head called me in for a chat with a tone that implied tea and consequences. We sat in her office with two chairs that made polite noises when you moved and a plant that had survived against the odds, which I respected. Ava did the apologies in the sentences we practised, the ones with nouns. She put her shoulders down when I gave her the look we have developed for such things. Mr. Hampton turned up halfway through on an errand for a stapler and ended up praising the drawing in a way that made Ava\u2019s mouth try not to be pleased and fail. \u201cIt\u2019s got the charm of a map,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be charming,\u201d and he said, \u201cGood,\u201d because he is a man who will pet awkward children like cats until they purr.\n\nThey mentioned a school exhibition of student work in two weeks, parents invited if they behave. I said I would come and clap quietly. On the way out, a mother I know by sight as someone who does everything competently and has strong views on leggings asked if I was the one who kept turning up in that \u201cmilitary business.\u201d Her smile was friendly enough to be dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s so brave of you,\u201d she said in a tone that made brave sound like a hobby. \u201cAnd distracting,\u201d she added, flicking her eyes towards Ava as if children are kites that get away in wind. I told my shoulders to stay where they were and said that lots of jobs are brave if you tilt your head, childcare, neurosurgery, the night shift at the corner shop after a match. She nodded as if I had said something philosophical and went away to be brave about gluten.\n\nMarcus arrived on Saturday in a coat that had an opinion and shoes that had never met a puddle. He brought a bag from a shop that sells candles at a price that would make my mother lie down, and inside was a jumper for Ava with sequins that fell off like confetti if you breathed near them. He did that thing where he looks around my kitchen like it is a set and then remembers he used to live in rooms like this and makes his face do humility. He kissed the top of Ava\u2019s head and she tolerated it for exactly as long as it took him to say \u201ckiddo,\u201d at which point she wrinkled her nose and said, \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d and then hugged him properly because love makes fools of us.\n\nWe went to the pancake place that has decided to be American via Harrow. He ordered like a man who knows the menu and asks for extras that do not make sense here. He wanted to know everything and also wanted to be told he was knowing everything very well. \u201cYou\u2019ll tell me when there\u2019s press,\u201d he said, eyes bright with the thought of being useful. \u201cI could talk to someone. Make sure they know you\u2019re more than the Army angle. Maybe get you a piece in that thing my mate\u2019s wife reads, the Sunday supplement with the plants.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not at the press bit yet,\u201d I said, cutting a pancake the size of a plate into squares like currency. \u201cAnd it will be a small thing in a big paper. Nobody wants to know about saffron except the five of us who have already made up our minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will,\u201d he said, in the voice he uses when he\u2019s pitching a scheme to men called Arjun who own bits of Manchester. \u201cYou\u2019re watchable. You\u2019re grounded. It\u2019s very now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow is a short window,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building the Taj Mahal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt took twenty years,\u201d he said, missing the point with the grace of a trained man. He asked about Marcus\u2019s world, and I let him tell me about cranes that mean money and how you can tell a city is moving by the number of coffee shops in a half-mile. He did not know that we measure a city by the number of aunties per block, but I did not hold it against him. He paid, not making a show of it for once, and the waitress called him \u201cbabe\u201d with such effortless familiarity that I almost clapped.\n\nHe came with us to Mum\u2019s later, stood in the kitchen with the photo of my father above the spice jars and did his respectful act with real heart. Mum fed him and he made the appreciative noises that unlock more food. She asked him if his mother was well and he lied politely and she pretended not to hear. When the aunties turned up with their eyebrows already at half-mast, he held his shape. He did not stay for the temple youth thing because football, because a mate, because the train back would be crowded with people whose voices exhaust him. Ava said she understood and she did and she didn\u2019t, because thirteen is the age where understanding is a coat you can take off when convenient. When he left, he hugged me like a man who doesn\u2019t want to admit he is apologising for something you haven\u2019t accused him of yet. \u201cYou tell me if you need anything,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cI need a reliable tap,\u201d and he laughed because he thought it was a joke.\n\nAt the temple, they put me in a line of women who have done something in the community and gave us plates that groaned under kindness. Auntie Rupa told me in stage whispers what each judge likes to eat, as if she had once dated them and was willing to share intel. The kids did a song with hand gestures and the drummer missed his cue in a way that made you love him harder. A teenager in a hoodie with a halo of hair did a spoken word piece about the city being made of mouths and it made everyone look at their own hands as if they had been caught stealing. I donated two saffron cakes and the first one went privately in the back room to the committee because committee duties require sustenance, and the second was cut into squares so small you could taste them only if you were patient. Mr. Patel was there with a bag that looked like it had been packed by a magician. He pulled out a tiny jar of saffron and put it in my palm like contraband. \u201cFor the day you decide to be greedy,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cTomorrow,\u201d and he laughed like a clock.\n\nOn Monday the sky did the flat tin thing it does when even the clouds can\u2019t be bothered to be dramatic. Becks rang me mid-morning with wind in her voice. \u201cPack a bag,\u201d she said, no hello, all weather. \u201cMACA. Yorkshire. Three nights, maybe four. Flooding and the council\u2019s lost the plot. We\u2019re on rotation with Barnet and the Medics. You\u2019ve got a job with your name on it and it involves getting soggy.\u201d\n\nI looked at the cake stand and it looked back with the nonchalance of an object that has never seen a sandbag. \u201cWhen,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d she said. \u201cRVs at 1900. You can say no if you\u2019ve got a reason that includes blood, death, other children, or court. Not telly. I will come round and drag you by your sensible plait if you say telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d I said, because there are parts of me that only light up when everyone else\u2019s coats are already wet. \u201cI\u2019ll get Ava to Mum\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and then softened. \u201cYou alright? You\u2019re thin in the voice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, and she said my name in the way that means I should try to think of a better adjective and I failed. \u201cI\u2019ll bring biscuits,\u201d I added, because bribes are ancient and effective.\n\nZoe took it well when I told her I might miss a pick-up day. \u201cReal life has better lighting anyway,\u201d she said, and asked me to send her a ten-second video for socials of my boots stepping into something as if it were poetry. I said no because I am an adult and have limits. She pretended to be sad and wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019ll find another day,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re not making news, we\u2019re making telly. Your flooded county can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nPacking for floods is a ritual made of lists you wish you didn\u2019t have. Thermal leggings that refuse to die. Socks that have opinions. Gloves that have forgiven you for last time. A small tin of cardamom, because I am not a savage and tea matters. Ava watched me line up kit on the bed with the attention of a girl who is making her list of future selves. \u201cYou\u2019ll text every time you\u2019re inside,\u201d she said, hands in her hoodie like a prayer. \u201cAnd every time you\u2019re outside. And you will come back with all your toes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll toes,\u201d I said. \u201cLeft foot attitude, right foot nuance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if Dad calls,\u201d she said, like she was testing an alarm. \u201cWhat should I tell him.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him the truth,\u201d I said. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried the other thing. It doesn\u2019t stick.\u201d\n\nMum took her in with the speed of a woman who has a spare bed and a spare plan always in the cupboard. \u201cBring her sketchbook,\u201d she said on the phone. \u201cI\u2019ve got that youth thing still, and she can sit in the corner and pretend to hate it while she draws aunties with their mouths open.\u201d We carried a bag down the stairs and Mrs. Devlin leaned out in an apron that said Kiss the Cook and the cook had lipstick on her cheek. \u201cHeroism again,\u201d she said, not a question. \u201cBring back a story that does not involve a weir. Those make me nervous.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d I said. \u201cThere will be sandbags, I promise. They\u2019re safer narratively.\u201d\n\nNight in a coach with bodies and rucksacks and the smell of ambition and damp. The window showed a road that kept arguing with fog. The guy across the aisle snored in the exact rhythm of a drum kit being tested. Becks made faces in the reflection until I laughed and got shushed by a corporal who was three years my junior and as old as a cave. We arrived at a leisure centre with a floor that had seen more Zumba than war, and did the thing you do where you make a place yours with tape, kettle, and a pile of dignity. The coordinator met us with a clipboard and the posture of a man whose house is three inches shorter than it was yesterday. \u201cBless you,\u201d he said, which is the kind of sentence I file under Not Useful But Sweet.\n\nThe next days were wet in a biblical but very British way. We lifted strangers\u2019 sofas onto paint tins and told them it helped because it helps a little to be told you have done something. We laid sandbags with hands that started out believing themselves to be strong and found out what strong means when your elbows disagree. We made tea in mugs with the names of football teams on them and the sugar went down like medication. We walked along a river that had decided to meet the road and not introduce itself first, and guided pensioners across with jokes we keep for such bridges. I stood in a living room where a wedding photo worn to softness watched us and thought about the sugar arch in my kitchen and the way I had had the nerve to think that was a problem.\n\nThere was a house with a woman who had a baby and the baby had a cough that made me want to go and fetch a doctor on my back. She kept apologising for the state of her floor and I kept telling her that floors don\u2019t have feelings. We found the stopcock like heroes and turned the water off like a magic trick for a three-year-old. When we had to move her chest of drawers we found under it a photograph of a girl in a school uniform with a tie like a melted snake, and the woman took it and held it as if it could absorb water. \u201cShe\u2019s at her dad\u2019s,\u201d she said, like she did not believe in the sentence yet. I told her to put the photo in a book and put the book somewhere high. I did not tell her to call him because that is not my business and also because my advice is often a wish in costume.\n\nAt night in the leisure centre people snored like orchestras and whispered like shows. The hall smelled of feet and triumph. Becks lived on crisps. I lay on a mat with my boots close enough to touch and texted Mum in the long grammar of check-ins. Ava sent photos of my mother\u2019s curries labelled by emoji. She sent me a picture of the arch she had drawn again, this time with rain on it that she had made with dots so neat it looked like a type of music. Rani\u2019s mum sent me a photo of the girls on her floor with juice cartons making a battlement. I sent back a picture of a sandbag with a smiley face someone had drawn on it with a marker because people will make faces on anything so they can talk to it.\n\nWe came back on a Thursday, mud in every seam, the coach thick with that tired cheerfulness that comes when you have been useful and no one died. The city rose up around us like a bad idea being very proud of itself. At the drill hall they let us drop our kit in a place it could smell of itself and I took my bag and ran my mind over the list of things you do to make home rehome you. The flat smelled like no one had been cooking, which hurt my pride and soothed something else. The sugar arch with the ribbon looked at me as if to say, You see, I am not the only mend. Ava came out of Mum\u2019s car a minute later in a hoodie that was not mine but felt like mine, and threw herself into my torso with a force that gave me a bruise and fixed my bones.\n\n\u201cYou smell like wet rope,\u201d she said into my sleeve, delighted and disgusted. \u201cAnd also like those blue sweets you don\u2019t let me have because you say they\u2019re made of sadness.\u201d\n\n\u201cSadness and chemicals,\u201d I said. \u201cBoth of which have their uses.\u201d I stood in my kitchen in damp socks and watched the kettle try to be a miracle. I burnt the first pan of sugar on purpose as an offering to the god of too much and laughed at myself because that is a ritual I can afford.\n\nThere was a letter on the mat from the landlord that had the wheedling tone of men who believe in statistics. It announced a rent increase with the apologetic air of a doctor holding a needle. I sat with it at the table that has seen more bills than cakes and felt the sum move around in my chest like a creature. The leak under the sink dripped into the tuppaware with a patience that felt like mockery. I called the number on the landlord\u2019s letter and it went to a voicemail that had never met a real person. I put my head in my hands and thought, What do we do to not go under, in a city that is always a centimetre from your mouth.\n\nMr. Patel saved me from turning into a spreadsheet by appearing in the doorway with a paper bag and a proposition. \u201cPop-up,\u201d he said, already halfway into my kitchen in a way that would annoy another person and makes me love him. \u201cTemple has their winter fair next Saturday. You take a table. You make something nobody else makes, which is to say everything. I will do you a deal on ingredients that will make me look generous and not actually bankrupt me. We will put a jar labelled Rent if you like, no shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a stall,\u201d I said, reaching for the bag because he had brought samosas and I am a coward. \u201cI\u2019m a person. I do not have a gazebo. I do not have the ability to smile at people who ask if there\u2019s a gluten-free option like they are asking if you have a spare kidney.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be behind a table,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will be a stall. It\u2019s a hat you put on like your beret. It will fit or you will pin it. Bring the girl. She can be the sullen assistant who makes the till go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a till,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou have a biscuit tin,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is the same thing but more honest. Take cash. Take card if you can make your phone behave like a machine. If anyone asks for a discount, tell them your mother\u2019s slippers will visit them in the night.\u201d He put the bag on the counter and the samosas made the kitchen smell like a braver room. \u201cYou think the show is going to give you your rent? The show will give you a montage. People give you rent. People, and sometimes the Army, and sometimes your mother if she is in a mood.\u201d\n\nThere are moments when pride needs to be told to sit down and put its feet up because humility has a better head for figures. I told him yes. He nodded like a man who had set a kettle and walked away certain it would boil. \u201cSaffron,\u201d he said, tapping the counter as if to write it into the laminate. \u201cPistachio. And one thing with chocolate for the teenagers who think complexity is betrayal. Make a sign that says We Don\u2019t Do TikTok. They will come out of spite.\u201d\n\nThe next days were lists and rinses. I went to the council website to check what the rules were about selling from a home kitchen and went cross-eyed over PDFs that spoke in a smug tone about hand-washing facilities as if sinks were optional. I filled out forms while Ava did homework that involved a man named Pythagoras who had never baked a cake in his life. I scrubbed my oven like a penitent and judged the state of my own fridge with the mercilessness I reserve for institutions. I watched videos about square card readers narrated by a woman called Jess who smiled like a drug. Becks came over on a night I had not planned for talking and lay on my floor with crisps like a cat and said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a stall. You\u2019re an emporium. I demand a staff discount that is expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will pay double,\u201d I said. \u201cThe markup is called Being Mean to Me in 2016 when I couldn\u2019t march without tripping.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d she said, grinning with her whole face. \u201cI\u2019m coming to heckle. I will bring the lads and we will buy all the chocolate thing and leave the sophisticated ones for the aunties and your Instagram.\u201d\n\nAva designed a sign without being asked in a burst of competence that felt like the weather changing. She wrote Lila\u2019s in script like icing and then Under New Management in block capitals like a joke. She drew a tiny fox in the corner wearing a hijab because the foxes in our estate have manners. She said, \u201cYou should not price anything in round numbers. It\u2019s not professional.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is professional,\u201d I said. \u201cIn this economy.\u201d\n\n\u201cA mess with an invoice,\u201d she said, absorbed, and I stroked her hair in the way I can do only when she is not looking.\n\nThe night before the fair, we did the kind of baking that turns a room into a clock. Saffron milk in a jug translucent with gold. Pistachios blanched and rubbed until they gave up their skins like men at the end of an argument. Chocolate ganache the colour of decisions. I set up a staging area we called in our house The War and put out ribbon and dowels and string and a spare roll of bin bags as if I were planning to start a new religion. Mum came over with a bag of things I had not asked for, including napkins with roses that had the exact energy of weddings in 1992. \u201cTake,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will wipe and bless you.\u201d\n\nWe slept the kind of sleep you buy at a shop that will not refund you. In the morning, the estate was a chorus of trolley squeaks and the sound of volunteers weekending. The temple car park had sprouted a landscape of tents that made the place look like a polite army had decided to occupy in order to sell chutney. Aunties with clipboards moved at speeds that defied their sandals. Mr. Patel wore a scarf that could have been used as a banner and greeted me like a fellow general. \u201cWe will put you here,\u201d he said, plonking me in the corner where the wind had a say but the light was forgiving. \u201cYou will be opposite the man with honey and next to the lady who does macram\u00e9. Do not get tangled.\u201d\n\nWe spread our wares with the reverence of a ritual: saffron pistachio slices that shimmered faintly, chocolate buns that exhaled like sleepy dogs, a tray of cardamom biscuits stamped with patterns that made them look more important than they needed to be. Ava put the sign at the front and stood behind the table with the air of a bank teller in a village under siege. Mr. Patel produced a card reader from his pocket as if conjured and told me I owed him my firstborn. I paid him in portions of cake and debt.\n\nThe first customers were aunties in a pack who pretended to be unimpressed until their second bite. A man in a football kit asked for something not too sweet and bought two of the sweetest things as an act of rebellion. A girl of eight wearing unicorn tights argued with her grandmother about whether pistachios were nuts or green raisins. Becks arrived with two soldiers in civvies and a megaphone, which I confiscated. Mrs. Devlin appeared in a hat that had not seen light since a wedding and bought six biscuits and then came back for four because she said she had a meeting with the lift and it required energy. Mira from the tent sent a cousin with a grin and a message that my ribboned arch had made her cry, in a good way, because good ways exist.\n\nAround twelve, a woman from a local paper with a camera that had been loved more than it deserved asked if she could take a photo. She said, \u201cArmy baker,\u201d with the lilt of a headline and I felt the old impulse to argue rise like a loaf. I said, \u201cWe\u2019re doing saffron and paying rent,\u201d and she wrote it down and asked me to stand with my boots in shot and then said, \u201cBut not like war, like weather,\u201d and I liked her more than I wanted to. The photo will make me look both too tall and too tired. It will make my mother cry. It will make my auntie cut it out and put it on her fridge and wipe it with a cloth every time she remembers to wipe something else.\n\nBy two we had a queue that made me want to apologise to the world and a float of change that had become a handful of coins and a promise. Mr. Patel kept up a running commentary like a cricket match. \u201cAnd Rahman comes in again with the pistachio, a strong offering, the crowd is appreciative, ten points to honesty,\u201d he said, and a kid laughed and decided to like us. A woman with a baby asked if cardamom is bad for milk and I told her no and would she like tea. An older man bought one biscuit, ate it standing there, dove into his jacket for a tenner and took another one to his wife at a stall selling ribbons, returning for a third because he had not told his wife about the second. We sold out of chocolate by three because teenagers do not care about subtleties. We sold out of saffron by four because aunties do. We put up a small sign in Ava\u2019s blunt writing that said Sold Out, Sorry, and a girl with glitter on her cheek looked at it like it had personally betrayed her.\n\nAfter, we counted coins with the solemn joy of pirates. We put the notes in a pile and Ava slapped her hand on them like she needed to keep them from flying away. We had enough to make the rent rise less like a cliff and more like a steep step. We had enough to go to the Turkish place after and eat chips under garlicky sauce and tell each other we were bosses. We had enough to give Mr. Patel his cut and have him tell us to keep more because he is a businessman and a human in that order on weekdays and the other way round on Sundays.\n\nAt home I put the tin on the table and we looked at it like it might have its own pulse. Mum counted it again because she trusts her fingers more than mine. Noush, the girl from number fourteen who is always on the stairwell listening to the world and pretending she is waiting for someone, popped her head in and asked if we had any leftovers and I gave her two and she sank to the floor like someone had told her a happy secret. The light did that slanted thing it does when the day is kind enough to let you know it\u2019s going. The leak under the sink dripped with the leap of a metronome. The cake stand on top of the fridge glowed like a thing that had been in a tent and learned respect.\n\nThe school exhibition came and with it the particular chaos of children in rooms with their names on the wall. Parents walked around like tourists in a city where the landmarks are small and taped. Someone\u2019s little brother cried with the dignified sorrow of boys under five. Mr. Hampton wore a tie that had been ironed by a woman who loves him only on Wednesdays. Ava\u2019s drawing of the arch with the fox had a Post-it next to it with a kind comment in a hand I recognised as the deputy head\u2019s. A girl from Year Nine had drawn a pair of boots that were clearly mine because she had put the mud on them the way Salisbury puts mud on a person. A boy had filmed a video where the camera did that jittery music video thing and I got telling-off feelings even though there was nobody to tell me off. Ava stood with her hands in the pocket of her hoodie and received praise like a medicine she had to swallow without water.\n\nA mother with very bright lipstick leaned in and said, \u201cDid she draw that from a photo, or is she one of those children,\u201d and I said, \u201cOne of which,\u201d and she laughed too much. Another father said, \u201cMy wife says she saw you at the temple thing with the cakes. She said you were \u2018inspirational.\u2019 I told her that\u2019s a lot to expect from a cupcake,\u201d and he smiled to show it was a joke and I smiled back to show I understood jokes. A boy looked at Ava\u2019s fox, at the crown, at the boots by the radiator in the corner of the frame, and then at me, and his face did a calculation that made him say, \u201cYou\u2019re her mum,\u201d in a tone I can\u2019t describe because it was a sorting and a blessing and an accusation and a welcome. \u201cThe cake one,\u201d he added, to be helpful.\n\nWe got home and I put the certificate she got for \u2018Exploration Through Line\u2019 on the fridge with the pigeon magnet because certificates are magnets\u2019 natural prey. She pretended to be annoyed and then asked me for a photo of it so she could send it to Rani. She didn\u2019t ask to post it, which is a grace I will not forget for a long time.\n\nThe following week brought an email from production with a subject line that wanted to be a hug. Family package, Tuesday, it said. Footage with Mum? Drill hall? Wembley? We will be kind. They wanted to film a morning like the ones we manufacture on purpose to look like mornings. They wanted to catch the bus hissing and Mrs. Devlin\u2019s radio and Mr. Patel producing fruit with a flourish. They wanted me to lace my boots on camera again and not blink at the thought that I had turned my life into a collage of useful angles. I said yes because they would film it anyway and I\u2019d rather it be me telling the story than the story making itself.\n\nWe did it. We did the thing where a crew with nice teeth turns up and makes your kitchen look like you have won at cleaning. Mum sat at the table and said things that made Zoe cry behind her monitor. Becks came to the drill hall and let them film a minute of us not marching but standing, which is more complicated than it looks when you know people are watching. They filmed my hands tying Ava\u2019s tie and had the decency to not film the bit where we argued about whether a hoodie under a blazer is a sin. They shot the stadium from the canal path and the fox from the estate went about his business without signing a release. They put a microphone on Mr. Patel and he resisted the urge to act, which is a victory I will count as mine.\n\nAt one point, Zadie asked me, \u201cDo you ever feel like an imposter,\u201d and I said, \u201cOnly on days that end in y,\u201d and she laughed, but later on the sofa when the house was quiet in the way you buy on hire purchase, I thought about the word properly. I have worn uniforms in rooms where you are asked to prove you are not a mannequin. I have had jobs where the men around you check their watch when you speak as if your time has started costing them money. I have stirred sugar at two in the morning and wondered if I had convinced myself that paying attention is the same as being talented. I have stood in a tent with my boots under my bench and my heart in my fist and told myself it wasn\u2019t a performance. I have been a mother who is not somebody\u2019s wife in rooms where wives are the currency. Imposter is a word for a person whose centre keeps enough moving parts that there is always a noise. I am learning to call it music and let myself dance.\n\nOne evening, after the cameras had gone and I had put the tea towel back on its hook like that mattered, I found myself on the floor with a stack of letters my father wrote my mother when he was a boy pretending to be a man. She kept them in a shoebox under the bed with the shoes because, she says, it\u2019s good for paper to smell ambition. His handwriting is a landscape I have walked since I was small. He wrote about buses and the price of tomatoes and the way a man once tried to sell him a watch that didn\u2019t tick. He wrote that he thought he would be a different person at thirty-two and he was both disappointed and not. He wrote that when he thought of me he thought of a mango, not for the sweetness but for the way a mango stains your hands and stays with you.\n\nI fell asleep on the rug with a letter on my face like a mask and woke to Ava putting a blanket over me with the delicacy of a person who would like to be loved without comment. \u201cYou\u2019ll get a line in your cheek,\u201d she said, cool as a nurse. \u201cFrom the writing. It\u2019ll say something mean like stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop stopping,\u201d I said, and she rolled her eyes and kissed my forehead because this is how we forgive each other for being ridiculous.\n\nIt rained the next morning, hard and then soft, the kind of rain that makes the fox\u2019s tail look like he has seen a ghost. The bus sighed into its stop like an old man. The leak under the sink did a particularly showy drip and I swore at it in a tone my mother would claim means I am becoming an English person. I called the landlord again and left a message that was both polite and overdosed with adjectives. I put saffron in milk too early in the day and it made the house smell like a memory. The geese at the park had another meeting. One of them looked me in the eye and I swear to you we negotiated.\n\nLater, Mr. Patel rang my bell and handed me a brown envelope with the air of a man who has decided to become mysterious. \u201cA friend,\u201d he said. \u201cOf my cousin\u2019s boy who did an internship in a place that had a budget. He does a market near Kensal on Sundays with nice stalls and velvet ropes for carrots. He saw your face in the paper with the lipstick. He says he\u2019d give you a table once. A trial.\u201d He said the last word with the relish of someone pronouncing a sentence on a villain. \u201cAre you bold.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am make-sure-my-child-has-shoes bold,\u201d I said. \u201cI am fix-my-leak bold. I am not velvet-rope-carrot bold.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe it,\u201d he said, and went away humming tunelessly like a kettle.\n\nThat night, I lay in bed with the fan doing that small irritating dance it does when it wants attention and listened to the building rehearse its sounds. Someone upstairs dropped cutlery and then laughed in the quick embarrassed way that people do when they remind themselves they live over other people. A boy on a bike went past and shouted a word that could be love or could be its cousin. Ava turned in her bed in the room next to mine and the sound of her changing sides was the sound that matters more than anything. I thought about the market near Kensal with carrots that deserve velvet and the drill hall with its honest oil and the tent with its impossible light, and I thought about the arch with ribbon and about how some things are better for having been repaired where you can see it.\n\nIn the morning, the email was there, as if the night had laid it like an egg. The subject line said simply: Opportunity. Inside, a man with a name like a brand said he had a slot for me at a market, one day, one table, no guarantees, only the chance to be looked at by the right eyes. He said he liked \u201cmy story,\u201d and I felt that stab of wanting to cut my story in half and hand him the piece that wouldn\u2019t bleed. He said he understood if I had commitments, if the Army had first call on my days, but that he hoped I could find a Sunday to become a stall again in a different city, slightly to the left of ours. He said he had loved the bit in the paper where my mouth did a determined thing. He said he had a tent that would not be cold.\n\nI wrote back with my grandmother\u2019s caution and my daughter\u2019s cheek. I said yes, in a way that admitted no, if the world decided to throw a flood at me again, or an arch, or a child with a drawing that needed air. I put the kettle on and the geese argued like politicians and Mrs. Devlin banged her door like a drum and Mr. Patel turned his sign to Open with the righteousness of a man who has never closed, and I stood at my window and watched the stadium blink like a ship signalling something. My boots were by the radiator doing their patient work of drying without fuss. My hands remembered sugar and sandbags and the weight of coins and a baby with a cough and my daughter\u2019s hair. I stretched my shoulders down where Staff had taught them to live, and then I rolled dough as if it could make a road, and I set my day to the rhythm of rising.",

                              "content": "Chapter Nine\n\nThe night of the broadcast turned the estate into a front room with walls we all pretended we couldn\u2019t see. Mrs. Devlin had said she would not be making a fuss and then left her door open like a shop, radio turned to the station that was pretending it was involved, a tray of biscuits that had been dusted with sugar as if that would make them behave. Mr. Patel arrived with a bag of savouries and a face that was trying on the expression of a man who didn\u2019t care if television existed. He lasted three minutes before asking me with the solemnity of a judge whether the bunting was ironed by a professional. The kids sat on stairs in their socks as if the stairs were a cinema, Ava in the middle of a sweep of girls who all smelled of pen ink and hair spray, pretending to be unimpressed and failing every time the camera went near our bench. Mum came with a shawl that had opinions and a Tupperware full of laddus that glowed like they knew their own fame. She sat like a queen and shushed people who were not making noise.\n\nThe tent looked flatter and brighter than it had, the tricks of edit smoothing the canvas into a polite sky. \u201cI look like I slept,\u201d I said, and Becks, who had commandeered a corner of the sofa and an entire bowl of peanuts, said, \u201cThat is the magic of telly, Rahman. It washes your face with lies.\u201d She did not cry, because she has a small religion against it, but when the bit with the sugar arch and the ribbon played, when the camera framed the moment like it was waiting for a break and then agreed to like me, she hit my ankle with her toe and didn\u2019t look at me, which is our way of not being sentimental in public. The show made a poem of the panic. Zoe\u2019s voice over the top was a warm scarf, telling the nation only what it needed to know and letting the rest rest its head on the edges of the frame. I watched myself watch Mireille say balance and heard our building inhale on cue. Somebody clapped, and then pretended the clap had been for a child sitting on the step instead of for me.\n\nThe moment they announced it, the cut they had shaped out of days of noise and discipline and buns that refused to be good, went through the stairwell like a rumour in a small town. Children squealed for reasons that included me and did not. A toddler in pyjamas clapped like he had been promised a train. A man I know only as the one with the dog that hates everyone shouted, \u201cGo on, girl,\u201d down the inside of the building and then pretended he\u2019d meant it for a different girl. Mum exhaled Alhamdulillah in a way that made one of the aunties on the third floor say it too, because blessings are contagious when you aim them properly. Mr. Patel banged a spoon on a saucepan, the universal language for party, and the lift chose that moment to wed itself to the ground floor with a melancholy thud.\n\nWhat I remember of the rest is both everything and nothing. People touched my face as if it were lucky. A teenager filmed me and then filmed herself reacting to me and then filmed herself reacting to her reaction until she was a mirror in a house of mirrors. Becks went up to the first landing with a megaphone she had absolutely not brought and shouted that there would be no autographs, which made everyone laugh and then ask her for an autograph, because that is the way things work when you bring your own joke. Mrs. Devlin cried into a biscuit, which was the only way she would allow tears to be seen. Mum told three people that I do not listen and then told them that this is why I am good at life. Ava didn\u2019t look at me for a while; she looked at the telly when it was not on and then looked at her friends and then at the drawing she had pinned on our door like a coat hook, and I knew she was positioning herself inside the story so that it would not position her first.\n\nAn hour later, when people had gone back to their rooms to do the thing where you talk about a thing more honestly when it is safe, the lift decided to tell its own story. It gave one soft wheeze and then shut itself down with a politeness that felt like insult. Noush from fourteen shouted, \u201cSeriously,\u201d like a prayer, and from inside the lift a voice said, \u201cHere we go,\u201d not scared exactly, but tired of having to be brave. It was Mrs. Brar from two floors up with her shopping and a child who was not hers hanging off her sleeve.\n\nI moved without thinking because the part of me that wears a uniform has longer legs. We did the drill we have done before with more grace and less swearing. Someone called the number we all have on our phones and got the operator who sounds like he exists inside a carpet. Someone else went to fetch the engineer who knows our lift better than his own children. I knelt by the door and shouted the voice you use for things that make people listen to themselves. \u201cDeep breaths, Auntie,\u201d I said. \u201cWe are here and the lift is trying to be interesting. Don\u2019t give it the satisfaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the coriander,\u201d she said, because people in danger always tell you about the most ordinary object in their hands.\n\n\u201cWe will not let the coriander wilt,\u201d I said, and the child laughed like a squeak toy. We talked through a meditation that was mostly nonsense\u2014picture a fox with an umbrella, picture a bus that is late but faster than a man, picture a ribbon tying an arch to a cake, picture your dinner. The engineer arrived with a key that looked like a joke and did his magic and I did not move until the door opened and Mrs. Brar was there, flushed but intact, coriander aloft as if she had carried a flag. The child leapt out and ran down the hall to tell other children who would tell it better. We applauded like a country that has survived something grander than two minutes in a metal box.\n\nWhen it was quiet again, when the estate had gone back to the business of pretending to be normal, Ava came to stand in the kitchen doorway and looked at the sink like it might declare something. \u201cI didn\u2019t like that bit,\u201d she said in a voice too even to be about the lift.\n\n\u201cThe ribbon,\u201d I said. \u201cYou didn\u2019t like the ribbon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked the ribbon,\u201d she said. \u201cI liked that you fixed it on telly, so every person knows what fixing looks like. I didn\u2019t like how the woman said \u2018your story\u2019 like it was a pet on a lead.\u201d\n\nI put my hands flat on the table because the table knows me. \u201cI can\u2019t make them stop saying story,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s the way they turn cake into drama. But I can keep the bits they don\u2019t get to see, and I can tell you that pie charts and pantries are stories too. We get to pick some of what goes in the book.\u201d\n\nShe put her hands next to mine, our fingers not touching but near enough for the heat to take the leap. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, and her mouth did that thing where it tries to be braver than her heart and then fails and becomes something better. \u201cDo we have any of the good mangoes or did Mr. Patel take them back because you are famous.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is famous in a building with our lift,\u201d I said, and found the mango he had slid into the bag like a secret.\n\nThe next morning the city was kind enough to act as if nothing had happened. The bus brake sighed, the geese decided something and then undid it, the leak under the sink performed its comedy on a beat. My phone behaved like a tin roof in rain. Messages from numbers I did not recognise arrived with a tone that tried to be peer-to-peer and read like a brochure. A woman from a magazine that sells people back to themselves in shiny pages asked if I might pose in uniform holding a whisk; I said no and thought about how many whisks it might take to bring a wall down. A man from a brand that makes yoghurt in jars wrote to say I embodied the modern mother; I put his email in a folder called Not Now, Because I am my own folder and not the place where you store your versions of me. There were also messages from women I used to go to school with, and men I had trained with who never learned the grammar of their own interior. My auntie texted me a photo of me on her TV with a caption that said simply, Lips, which I knew meant the dusky lipstick had passed muster.\n\nMore important than all of that, there were orders. Messages from people in Wembley and people who used to live in Wembley and people who like to say they know Wembley when they are near it. Could they have gujiya for a family function on Sunday. Could they have pistachio cakes for a naming ceremony, not too sweet. Could they have a tray of cardamom biscuits stamped with a pattern that looks like their grandmother\u2019s tablecloth. Could I, would I, might I. I lay down on the sofa with the phone on my chest and felt expansion like a thing with weight. It\u2019s a joy that comes with maths attached. I could say yes and yes and yes and find myself at three in the morning a month from now making sugar behave in a kitchen where the extractor fan is a liar. I could rent a corner of a commercial kitchen somewhere with good light and a fridge that doesn\u2019t elbow back. I could ask Mr. Patel to act as foreman and he would do it with a whistle. I could do none of that and keep the tenderness of baking for neighbours who can knock when things go wrong.\n\nWhen I stood up, I knocked the pigeon magnet and it clattered to the floor with the small courage of things that don\u2019t break. Under it was one of Ava\u2019s notes that had been there a while, the one that said back soon in a hurry of letters. I picked it up and stuck it back with more conviction. Then I called the council and told them my name as if it were new. The woman who answered had a voice that made paper sound like a resource. We talked about food business registrations and hygiene inspections and the fact that my sink counts as a handwash basin only if I promise to be good. \u201cYou have to keep records,\u201d she said, and I said, \u201cI am in love with records,\u201d because it\u2019s almost true. She said a man called Ken would come and look at my kitchen and my soul and put a number in the window that would tell the world I am clean. I imagined a sticker as holy as a medal and told myself to mop again just in case.\n\nThe week unspooled like pastry if you\u2019re not gentle. Ava\u2019s school sent forms for a residential trip for art kids to the coast, two nights in a hostel with seagulls that have seen things. The cost made my throat tighten and then relax because sometimes I forget that invention is my mother tongue. We would make the money with flour and heat and patience and the way our neighbours open their wallets when they think the money will do something other than make a man in a suit proud. I said yes with a hand that shook and Ava said nothing for a full minute, which is her most intense form of thanks, and then left a note under the pigeon, a doodle of a seagull wearing trainers that looked like mine.\n\nKen arrived to inspect my kitchen with a clipboard and a smile that had never found irony useful. He wore a tie with violins on it and told me he had once won a pub quiz because of a question about cardamom. He liked my fridge because my fridge is trying. He frowned at my wooden spoons because he has seen things you cannot bleach out of wood. He admired my thermometer in the way men admire tools that beep. \u201cYou look like a person who cleans even when no one is watching,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cI am a person who cannot think when there are crumbs,\u201d and he nodded as if I had confessed to sainthood. He made notes that will never be read by anyone other than him and God and me. He told me to get a bigger bin and a different soap. He put a label on my window with a number that will not impress trend people and will make my aunties cry. It is amazing how much comfort a green circle can give when the world sometimes looks like a red square.\n\nThe market near Kensal was another place people invented to sell themselves. It looked like a film about a market instead of a market about food. Carrots wore their greens like opera hair. People in sunglasses peered at mushrooms as if they were fragile ideas. A woman sold wool that had not met a sheep in a year and charged as if for the company. The organiser had a name that sounded like a season and the handshake of a man who knows what rent is but has never paid it himself. He liked my pitch and did not like my tablecloth. \u201cCan you make it look more\u2014\u201d he said, and let the word fall between us like a complication. I told him my tablecloth had seen births and deaths and the scorch marks of a good life and he said, \u201cPerfect,\u201d because he has learnt that telling the truth gets you nowhere if the story is stronger.\n\nI brought the ribboned arch because it felt like a signature, set it on a dummy cake like a prop in a play about mending. People stopped. They always do when they see something that looks like more than the sum of its parts. A boy in a coat with shoulders too big came close and asked me if it was edible like he was asking if the moon had a flavour. I told him sugar tastes like the moment you decide to try again. He bought a biscuit and ate it slowly as if that would make the moment last.\n\nWe did well and we did not. The aunties did not come because it was not our place. New people came and said the word fusion with the wrong mouth. A woman asked if my military career had made me more disciplined with icing and I told her I think discipline is just a way of saying you care enough to prefer things done properly. Another woman took a photo of me without asking and I took a photo of her taking a photo and she didn\u2019t know where to look. A man who said he had a supper club in a railway arch said he could do a collaboration if I could make something that wasn\u2019t so Indian, which made me laugh in a way he didn\u2019t appreciate.\n\nHalfway through the day, Ava elbowed me and tilted her head to the right with a surgeon\u2019s precision. There was a girl stood across the aisle pretending to look at flowers. She had the look on her face I recognise from mirrors years back, the one that says, I would like to talk to you but I have used up my words on surviving. She hovered, left, came back. When she did finally approach, she had her arms crossed like a shield and a practical ponytail that could cut glass. \u201cYou\u2019re the one from the show,\u201d she said, keeping her tone bored. \u201cMy mum made me watch it because she thinks cooking means we\u2019ll talk to each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that mum,\u201d I said. \u201cShe lives in a lot of houses.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe liked when you fixed the thing,\u201d the girl said, not looking at the arch. \u201cShe made a noise at the telly. She does that when she thinks a thing is like her life and she doesn\u2019t want to say it out loud.\u201d\n\nWe stood like that for a minute, shoulder to shoulder, our eyes on a bunch of beetroot that had gone too far with its outfit. \u201cDo you like cooking,\u201d I said finally, because questions make space.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s messy,\u201d she said, which could have been an answer to anything. \u201cMy little brother likes to stir until it goes everywhere and then tell me I did it. I like drawing better because if you leave it alone for two minutes it doesn\u2019t put itself on the ceiling.\u201d\n\nI wanted to tell her about sugar stages like moods, about the quiet satisfaction of a bowl that has learnt your hand, about the way cooking gives back without asking for your history. Instead, I slid a biscuit towards her as if it had slid by itself. \u201cOn the house,\u201d I said. \u201cNot because you said I was from the show. Because you stood there until you felt like yourself.\u201d\n\nShe nodded and left with the particular dignity of girls who have taught themselves not to say thank you for things they should have had anyway. Ava watched her go with her face softened into something that made me think of her when she was small, when gratitude was a full-body event. \u201cPeople come to you like you\u2019re a bus stop,\u201d she said, munching on a broken bit with the air of a thief. \u201cThey know you\u2019ll go somewhere even if they don\u2019t know where.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes they get on and sometimes they just read the timetable,\u201d I said. \u201cEither way the bus stops keeps existing.\u201d\n\nBack home, the money counted itself into piles that made sense and then tilted. I looked at the landlord\u2019s letter again and had the thought I have been refusing: maybe we will have to move. The idea had been sitting under the sink with the leak. It had mould, it had a smell, it had the particular misery of thinking about removing magnets from a fridge. I put it back where it had been and promised myself a month. A month of markets and orders and small acts of commerce in between drills and floods and Ava\u2019s occasional need to leave a room and breathe drawing air. A month to see if I could make my kitchen stand up on legs that were not just stubbornness.\n\nPrivate Lewis\u2019s sister came into the shop where I was lurking by the flour with a shy sort of purpose and asked if I would make a cake for her wedding in April. \u201cA small one,\u201d she said, hands like a bird, \u201cbecause we cannot afford your big ones from telly, but small with attention.\u201d I said attention is free and she cried as if I had handed her the ocean and then hugged me with a fierceness that saved us both. We chose flavours that would please her uncles and keep her mother from saying the word dry. We made a plan that involved sugar flowers because she liked the way they keep living. She told me she had watched the episode with her fianc\u00e9 who had been quiet and then said he would like to be the ribbon in their story and I pretended to laugh because I do not want men to know I can be charmed.\n\nThe Army decided to put me on a course for a week about leadership in conditions that are adverse but not hostile, a phrase that covers more of life than doctrine knows. Becks sent me a list of items I didn\u2019t need to bring and then turned up with half of them anyway because she believes in preparedness for other people. The course was in a building that looked like a 70s library and acted like a boot. Men with haircuts discussed calm with the furrowed brows of people who punch things in their spare time. A major with the expression of a man who blesses his toast told us that leadership is posture and language, and I thought about how many ways there are to stand and to speak and how often I have chosen softness before volume and paid for it twice. We did exercises that involved moving heavy objects together without spilling them, which is motherhood turned into team-building. When we had to stand up and deliver a plan to a room pretending to be sceptical, I opened my mouth and the words came out in the voice I had been using in my kitchen to tell sugar that I love it but not to be silly. After, a captain told me that watching me made him breathe slower and I said I would invoice him.\n\nAva texted me photos of her eating round meals with my mother and of the fox that had decided the estate was his now and of the seagull on the school roof that had started a feud with a boy named Idris. She included the kind of commentary that is half humour, half a map of her mood. On the third day of the course, she sent one line: Can we dye my hair the colour of pistachio shells. I wrote back Yes if you write me a paragraph about why and she sent me three sentences about being visible when you don\u2019t know what you want and about the way brown hair is fine and also it is a landscape she would like to draw on. We went to a place that smelled like hair and gossip and did it softly, softly, the colour like a suggestion. She came out with a halo of green that made her look like a story without making her look like a warning. Mum pretended to disapprove and then took fifty photos.\n\nThe thing about being seen is that it does not stop on its own. The show\u2019s social team posted a clip of me saying \u201cnot too shy\u201d to ghee, and people argued pleasantly about whether British food needs more spice or less personality. Someone found my old post about the arch with ribbon and an account with the taste of a brand asked if I might like to collaborate on a \u201cResilience Recipe,\u201d which made me want to go and sit in the lift and tell it stories until it gave up. A man who had never eaten saffron told me it is too much and I told him his opinion had underproved. I learned to say no with the voice of a person who says yes to things that feed her people. I learned to put my phone in the drawer with the spoons at certain hours and let it sulk.\n\nOne evening after the course, just as the light was thinking about giving up, there was a bang from the stairwell that had the texture of a judgement. I went out with the reflex of a mother and a sergeant and found Mrs. Devlin sitting on the second landing with her back against the wall, her face pale in a way I have learnt to respect. \u201cIt\u2019s my daft heart,\u201d she said with the briskness of a woman who refuses to die in public. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. It remembers to beat, but sometimes it wants applause.\u201d We did exactly what you do: called, counted, breathed. Ava sat on one side and told her about the seagull feud. I sat on the other and listed quietly every biscuit we had made that week. The paramedics arrived with their efficient kindness and carried her downstairs with the grace of a ceremony. She told them they were handsome and they told her she had the best hat they had seen all day. They took her away and the stairwell exhaled and we went home and I stood over the sink and shook in a way I allowed only there, in the presence of plates and a leak that keeps its own counsel.\n\nShe came back three days later with a plaster on her hand and a diagnosis she recited to the building in a voice of triumph. \u201cA blip,\u201d she said, from her doorway like a newsreader. \u201cThey said it\u2019s thinking about retiring. I told it we do not have the money. I am on pills that will make me pee like a river. Bring me your gossip and a sponge cake if you have one.\u201d We did. Mum sent over a broth that could heal a small country. Mr. Patel offered her a mango and she told him not to flirt and he pretended to be offended. The building re-learned the sound it makes when the heart of it has hiccupped and come back.\n\nThe rent letter sat on the table like a toad. I looked at it in different lights to see if it might change its mind. I did the sums again and again until the numbers became faces. Ava\u2019s trip. Mum\u2019s prescriptions. Saffron. Socks. Rice. The Army pays. The cakes pay a bit. The market pays in compliments and a yellow sticker for my Instagram. The drill hall pays in lungs. The landlord wants to pay for a holiday and maybe a new front door in a different postcode. I told myself my home is a many-roomed thing. I told myself perhaps the walls have to change for the rooms to keep existing. I told myself we are many people and we do not need to prove it by staying in one place. I told myself I am not convincing.\n\nOn a Tuesday that smelled like wet newspaper, Zoe rang with the voice she uses when she is asking me something I might hate. \u201cChristmas special,\u201d she said, and I could hear a roomful of people behind her pretending to be spontaneous. \u201cThe network wants a reunion thing. Not full tent. Just you in your kitchen with a candle and a ridiculous sweater. A little sequence for after the Queen\u2014sorry, the King\u2014does his thing. You making something that looks like a jewel and saying something that makes people feel like their sofa loves them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a ridiculous sweater,\u201d I said. \u201cI have a jumper my ex bought from a shop that makes you smell like money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s perfect,\u201d she said. \u201cThe contrast. Can we come on the twelfth. We\u2019ll bring candles. We\u2019ll bring a woman who is excellent with light. We will bring a ham if you want. We will bring nothing if that\u2019s kinder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will bring the kindness,\u201d I said. \u201cEverything else can be argued over.\u201d\n\nAva overheard me agreeing and said, \u201cAre we going to be the people who are on at Christmas,\u201d with a disdain disguising delight. \u201cBecause Rani\u2019s cousins are going to make fun of me and I will pretend not to like it and secretly be made of light.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will be the people who make a saffron jewel,\u201d I said. \u201cWe will not be the people who sell tea towels with our faces on. Not yet.\u201d\n\nThe twelfth came with crew and fairy lights and a willingness to rearrange my kitchen so it looked like better versions of itself. Mum sat at the table wearing a sari that made Zoe make a face like prayer. Becks turned up with a Yule log she had bought because she cannot stand to arrive with a face only. They filmed me stirring milk and saffron into a gold that looked like it might have opinions about monarchy. They filmed my hands tying Ava\u2019s hair with a ribbon while pretending they were filming the ribbon. They filmed the fox under the bins as if he were a metaphor and then told me he was uncredited. I said a little thing about being held by a city and not letting it break you, and Zoe cried in spite of herself and then swore because it had become a habit.\n\nA week later, a letter came to the building addressed to me but without my flat number, which means a stranger had to ask Mrs. Devlin which door to push it under. It was from Private Lewis\u2019s mother on lined paper that had been in a drawer that used to hold bills. She wrote about his tears at biscuits and about his pride, which is a word that doesn\u2019t sit easily in that family but had found a chair. She asked if he could carry my cake to the table at the wedding because he wanted to do something delicate in public and not be mocked. \u201cHe is good with delicate,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe once put a butterfly outside that had flown into our bathroom and he did not make fun of himself.\u201d I wrote back yes in a hand that tried to behave and told her to tell him I would let him hold the arch for a minute so long as he did not cough.\n\nTwo days before the Christmas special, the landlord posted a second letter with a tone that could curdle milk. He said he understood that the market had made things hard, but his costs were also rising, as if his costs had blood in them. He said he would be inspecting in January to assess wear and tear, and the words wore their own shoes. I rang him and the phone went to the voice of a man who has paid someone else to be his voice. I left a message I should not have, heat under the edges, and then I baked something with cinnamon for the first time in months because I wanted to remember why it is softer, why it goes in postcards and not speeches.\n\nMarcus rang in the afternoon to tell me that a friend had mentioned an opportunity in Manchester, a unit above a shop that could be a kitchen if I were brave. \u201cYou\u2019re itinerant,\u201d he said, with love that had forgotten where it came from. \u201cYou can bake anywhere you put a table.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can bake where my child knows the sound of the bus,\u201d I said. \u201cI can bake where a fox knows my bins. I can bake in rooms that know how to say my name without it turning into an advert.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like that,\u201d he said, injured by a tone he would have used on me without apology. \u201cI\u2019m just thinking of options.\u201d\n\n\u201cOptions are good,\u201d I said, and we hung up with our postures in two different centuries.\n\nWe did Christmas like a small country that knows itself. Mum cooked too much and packed me containers I will never return. Ava wore a jumper with a fox in a scarf that had found its way from a shop it shouldn\u2019t have. The special came on with the kind of niceness that would make me smirk in July but in December becomes medicine. There I was, on the telly, in my kitchen that had been polished with light, stirring gold and telling a camera that you can be more than one thing at once and feed everyone you love without running out. Mr. Patel texted me a photo of his family in front of his television with all of their chins up as if they were in a portrait. Becks sent a voice note in which she pretended to be unmoved and then swore. The building was quiet at ten in that way that means someone had a row earlier and it went on long enough and is now sleeping. The fox went about his business and I did mine.\n\nIn January, the inspection came in the shape of a man wearing a coat that had never met a lift. He walked around my kitchen with a tape measure like I was going to sell it by the yard. He noted the leak under the sink, which I have been noting for months, and tutted as if the leak were gossiping about him. He peered at the skirting and asked about wear and tear and I showed him the scorch mark on the table and told him it was not the flat\u2019s fault, and he smiled with his mouth. He asked about my \u201clittle business,\u201d and I told him it had a number in the window and a rating and he said that was nice in the way people say that when they are trying to turn a person into a hobby. When he left he said, \u201cWe all have to move sometime,\u201d as if that were a proverb, and I closed the door and swore with a sophistication that would have impressed Staff.\n\nI told Ava we might have to go. I told her late in the day when her defences are down and the world has softened, because cruelty is not a personality. She listened with a face that did not have a tantrum in it, and then she did the thing I am always both ready for and surprised by; she made a plan. \u201cOkay,\u201d she said, her voice turning into notes. \u201cIf we move, we move near enough to a bus I know, and near Mrs. Devlin if she\u2019ll let us, and near Mum because food, and also not near anyone who thinks wearing a coat inside is a personality. And we keep the kettle. And we keep the pigeon magnet. And we make a map before and after. And we call the kitchen something cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would we call it,\u201d I said, because hope is a habit you have to practice.\n\nShe thought for a second, brow doing its clever knot, and then said, \u201cRibbon & Arch,\u201d like she had been keeping it in her pocket for months. \u201cBecause everything is held together and also we live under a curve.\u201d\n\nI wrote it down in my notebook in letters that made my heart feel less fidgety. The name took the room like a calm. I could see it on a sticker and a box and a sign that would be painted by a person who loves letters. I could see it on a ticket for a market where carrots wear velvet; I could see it on a receipt written in my auntie\u2019s hand with the flourish she reserves for people who get married. I could see it on a piece of paper I gave to Ken for the records he keeps because people should keep such records.\n\nWhen Lewis\u2019s sister\u2019s wedding day came, we did the cake in slices that looked like argument and peace side by side. The hall was decorated with ribbon that pretended to have opinions. Lewis wore his suit like a person who had been taught posture in a field. He lifted the cake as if it were an animal that might spook and carried it across the floor with his head high, cheeks flushed, the room watching in a way that would have hurt him once and now made him grin. He put it down like a prayer and stepped back and his mother cried and then laughed because she refuses to cry for too long in front of people who might use it. We stood in a corner later with paper plates and talked about briefings and biscuits and the way a good day holds its shape. He told me he thought about applying to a course for medics, that he liked the idea of his hands being useful when it was dark. I told him to do it before the city convinced him otherwise. He said he would keep a biscuit in his pocket like a reason.\n\nAfter the wedding, I walked home the long way to make the day longer. The stadium lights were off, which always makes it look honest. The arch was a ghost and then a spine and then nothing and then there again. I stopped by the canal and the water did its argument with gravity. The fox on the path paused and looked at me with the slant of tolerance he reserves for neighbours. Somewhere a bus closed its doors like it was tired of itself. I thought about Ribbon & Arch on a door in a street I could draw with my eyes shut. I thought about a kitchen where the leak got fixed and the light didn\u2019t argue and the floor didn\u2019t crunch. I thought about my people, my army, my aunties, my child, the way we have made a room together out of all our competing purposes.\n\nWhen I got in, there was a card on the mat addressed to Lila and underlined like a baton. Inside was a note from a woman named Bernadette who ran the community centre near the library. She had seen the article about the stall and liked the part about being held by a city. She said their kitchen was underused and their rate was modest and their windows were high. Would I like a key on Tuesdays and Thursdays and a folder with the names of other people\u2019s mothers. Would I like a locker and a shelf with my name on it and a place to keep a bin that no one would move. Would I like to teach a class to people who think cake is a thing other people eat. Would I like to be a person who walks in and flicks on a strip light and is warmed by the warmth of rooms.\n\nI sat at the table and put my head in my hands and laughed like a person who has been thirsty and found a tap. I texted Mr. Patel and he replied with a mango emoji and the word Finally. I texted Becks and she sent a photo of her in a beret with the caption Chef! and then another saying, you can order me about in a kitchen but if you tell me to julienne I\u2019ll tell your Mum. I texted Mum and she said, \u201cWe\u2019ll bring laddus to the first class and tell everyone they are not allowed to leave until their ghee behaviour improves.\u201d I went to Ava\u2019s room and showed her the card and she held it like a ticket and said, \u201cCan we put the fox on the sign,\u201d and I said, \u201cHe\u2019ll eat the letters,\u201d and she said, \u201cExactly.\u201d\n\nThe next day, I met Bernadette in a room that resembled every community centre kitchen you have ever seen and yet, because I stood in it, felt like the first kitchen. Steel tables that had known arguments and compromises. A fridge for milk and forgotten yogurt. A cupboard where the tea lived next to a bag of pasta that had its own origin story. She showed me the sinks and the thermometer and the light that flickered like a thought and said she would get the caretaker to look at it. She showed me the back door and the fire exit and the shelf with space for my tins. She showed me the view of the library, which is to say the view of the people who think so much the air burns. I put my hand on the steel table as if to take its temperature. It was cool and ready. I could feel the hum of the town hall across the way, the small solar system of people doing their jobs with too little money and too much competence.\n\nWe made a plan that involved Tuesdays and Thursdays and a register and a key that looked like a key in a book. We shook hands like grown-ups. She told me she liked my show face and she liked my neighbour face more. She told me the scout group came on Wednesdays and sometimes left glitter and apologies. She told me the cleaner was called Blessing and she was exactly that. I left with a key in my pocket, and in my body a feeling like I had unfurled something I had been keeping folded for too long.\n\nOn the walk home, the geese had one of their meetings and I stopped and told them about Ribbon & Arch because I am not too dignified to inform birds of my plans. The stadium was off again and in that offness it was more ours. The bus brake sighed. A neighbour played a song I haven\u2019t loved in years and made me love it a bit again just because it came through a wall. Mr. Patel had written OPEN CLOSED OPEN on his sign with a question mark. Mrs. Devlin\u2019s door was half-ajar and the smell of something celebratory slid out. Ava was at the kitchen table with her pencil case open like a city and her head bent over a list of things seagulls do that we do not admire and should not imitate.\n\nI put the key in the middle of the table and we both looked at it. It wasn\u2019t large. It had no ribbon. It didn\u2019t hum. But it was heavy in a way that made sense. It was the weight of something that unlocked other people\u2019s doors as well as mine, that made the private part of what I do into a public act without making me a liar. Ava reached out and touched it with one finger like it might bite and then grinned up at me with all her old baby teeth shining through her new girl face. \u201cYou\u2019ll let me paint the fox on a wall,\u201d she said, more statement than question, and I said, \u201cWe will see what Blessing says,\u201d because we live in a community and we have our manners.\n\nThat night, I took my notebook and wrote in it like I used to when I was a soldier and the only way to make sense of the day was to arrange it on a page. Ribbon & Arch at the top in a hand that looked like I had practised hope. Under it: Tuesdays and Thursdays, Bernadette, church hall tea urn, Blessing, key. Under that: gujiya class for aunties who pretend they don\u2019t need instruction, one cake a week for people getting married and people getting buried, three trays of biscuits for Mr. Patel to sell to men who need to feel generous before their wives do. Under that: find a way to tell the landlord that we will move if we have to but not quietly. Under that: the Army still there, the drill hall still there, Becks and her crisp life still there, the people in Yorkshire and on Salisbury Plain and on parade squares that are also home. Under that: don\u2019t forget to breathe when the sugar gets to hard crack, don\u2019t forget to look at your child when she is walking out of a room so she knows you see her very much, don\u2019t forget to write down where you are going when you go, don\u2019t forget to leave the note under the pigeon, don\u2019t forget to put your shoulders down.\n\nBefore I slept, I went to the window because I always do, because the world likes to be checked on. The fox trotted under the bins as if he had a list. The lift wheezed and then didn\u2019t. The stadium held its shape. The arch was a thin line against a faraway sky, a memory, a dare. I thought about the ribbon that had made it pardonable to break. I thought about the girl at the market who had stood there until she felt like her own name again. I thought about my father\u2019s handwriting, the way it made a path for my face, telling me thirty-two is just another number you fill with meaning or neglect. I thought about Ken and his green circle. I thought about Mum and her slack hand on the arm of the sofa when a programme is good. I thought about Becks and her ankle taped in 2012. I thought about Private Lewis and his hands, gentle on a cake even when the room watched. I thought about a key on the table and a sign that does not yet exist and a sticker that will one day be on a door. And then I slept, the careful sleep of someone who knows the morning will ask her to rise and knows she can say yes.",
