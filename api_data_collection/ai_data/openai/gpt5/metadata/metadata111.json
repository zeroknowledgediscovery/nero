     "novel_text": "She ran before the sun had decided what color to become. Bandung was a basin of mist, a bowl of half-breathed air, and she cut through it along the lane that still held night in its asphalt. On the backstretch, between the banana trees that leaned beyond the fence and the bleached sponsor banners, Dara could hear her own lungs and the soft thud of her shoes as if someone else were keeping time for her.\n\n\u201cLast set,\u201d Pak Bram called. His voice had a rasp that made everything sound like a warning.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. She kept her eyes level, refusing to look at the hurdles spread along lane three like sleeping dogs. The hurdles were for later. The warm-up called for circuits and acceleration. She took the curve and pressed into the straight, shoulders low and loose, jaw easy. The mist pulled away. The city in the distance, beyond the stadium wall, paled with the hint of morning traffic.\n\nIf she kept her eyes on the ground three meters ahead, she didn\u2019t have to count, she didn\u2019t have to measure her footfalls. She knew them by how her hips moved, how the left calf tightened at seventy meters, how the right shoulder dropped when her concentration broke and she remembered\u2014no.\n\nShe cut that thought off like a finger pulled back before the flame. The brain is a liar. The body knows.\n\nShe finished the acceleration and walked back, hands on hips, heart shouting. A small thread of hair had come free from her ponytail. It tickled her cheek like a whisper.\n\n\u201cWhy you look like someone\u2019s chasing you?\u201d The voice came from the fence. Vina had draped herself over the railing, her smile lazy and sharp. She was a sprinter, a snapped elastic band coiled in human shape. She saw things, then told them to the wrong people.\n\n\u201cI have a coach,\u201d Dara said, keeping her breath even. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I listen to him sometimes.\u201d Vina winked toward the middle of the field where Pak Bram hunched as if he could will them all into speed by compressing his bulk into a boulder. \u201cYou know there\u2019s a rumor you made him change the schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear rumors.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone hears rumors.\u201d\n\nDara pretended to tie her shoe. Traffic sighed beyond the stadium. A bird, one of the brown, ordinary ones that nested in the tunnel lights, skittered along the metal struts and dropped something unidentifiable onto the track's border.\n\nThe hurdles in lane three leaned with smug inevitability.\n\nShe took water from her bag, sipped, swallowed, and didn\u2019t let herself look further into the bag where the tape was, the spikes, the little sachet that made her palms dry out as soon as she saw it. Among her socks, the sachet rattled like teeth.\n\n\u201cLangsung ya, Dara.\u201d Pak Bram clapped. \u201cFive sets. We go over, we go back. Pace is race. No cutting.\u201d\n\nThere were some murmurs, someone groaned, someone else half-laughed. Dara set the bottle down. She jogged to the start of the lane, to the first hurdle, the metal paint flaking off a little where the adjustable legs had rubbed too often.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Naya whispered. Naya had a voice like rain. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Dara said.\n\nThey stood the hurdles. The metal legs squeaked. She could see the small rust-dark circles where rubber feet had been ripped off and replaced. Her lane looked like a sentence spelled out in obstacles, punctuation marks that only made sense when she ran.\n\n\u201cSiap?\u201d Pak Bram\u2019s whistle was in his mouth, his fingers around the stopwatch.\n\n\u201cSiap,\u201d they said, a little chorus, the words rolling and making light of everything.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be bad. Not now. There was nothing in the open. They always searched; they always\u2014they? She laughed at herself, a tiny, mean laugh in the back of her throat. They, as if the spiders were a gang with a leader, a strategy. As if the one that had been her first wasn\u2019t\u2014no. Focus.\n\nThe first set, she lifted, drove the knee, counted her steps to the takeoff, the same rhythm she always had, the one she had drilled into the muscle between calf and shin, into the angle of her hip, into the hinge of her ankle. She cleared, she landed, the world contracted to a route and a breath. Nothing shifted in the periphery. No black or brown or anything flickering. She felt good, even ease. She turned at the end, slowed, walked back, tasted the metal in her mouth that comes when the morning is cold and your lungs are trying to make fire.\n\nShe could do this.\n\nSecond set, she clipped the third hurdle. The stumble made her vision bump for a second. She let the adrenaline go through her and out. When she landed, a movement bloomed at the edge of her left eye. Something on the next lane over, small, almost a dot, fast in that lurching way that made her whole body smell like it's already sweating.\n\nIt was nothing. A drop falling from the metal. A leaf. A\u2014don\u2019t think the word.\n\nShe cleared the fourth, the fifth. Her stride shortened; she overcompensated; she felt the trail leg catch and pulled it back with a grunt that Naya would hear later and ask about.\n\nWhen she walked back after the set, the small movement was where her bag was, by the fence, on the concrete lip. She told herself she would not look. She told her brain no. She looked.\n\nA spider, not big, not\u2014maybe the size of a thumbprint if a thumbprint were a waiting thing. Brown, body a little low, legs quick and pointed the way stray nails point out from a beam. It was on the outside of her bag, near the zipper pull. A line of web that you could mistake for a hair had already touched the metal.\n\nNo. No no no. It was nothing. They were always somewhere. This was outside. But inside, in, inside where her socks were, where she had put her shoe, where her\u2014she couldn\u2019t stop the image of a narrow space into which any number of brown bodies could press. She felt the place below her rib tighten, the stomach\u2019s fist.\n\nShe heard Vina from the other lane. \u201cDara? You slowing? Come on lah. This is just practice.\u201d\n\nShe tried to unclench. She tried to breathe past the rust.\n\n\u201cNext two sets double pace,\u201d Pak Bram shouted. \u201cWe need race speed. This is not a picnic.\u201d\n\nDara moved to the start again. She didn\u2019t look at the bag. She didn\u2019t look anywhere except the hurdle top bar, white and scratched, the chip that looked like a small tooth mark, her mark that she had made weeks ago.\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d she whispered to the track, to the ground, to her legs whose memory was sometimes more reliable than her heart.\n\nShe went. Everything came up to meet her: the first one intimately familiar as a bedpost at night, her own hands on the sheets. The second a suggestion of risk that she took with the casual courage of a practiced risk-taker. She landed, two steps, three, takeoff, push, flick. Breath. The third came wrong. Something sunk its tiny hooks into her lungs. On the edge of the lane, at the foot of the fourth hurdle, a small blackish tangle had lodged in the ragged seam where track and grass met. It moved.\n\nHer legs made their decision before she did. They curled, they refused. She brought up her foot early and the hurdle told her immediately that she was wrong with the sharp crack of shin on wood. She went down hard, palms, knees, the taste of something that belonged to last week\u2019s rain and the rubber of thousands of soles.\n\n\u201cDara!\u201d Naya\u2019s voice, close but not touching.\n\nShe rolled to her back to get her knees up, to make space in her chest. The sky above the stadium was a blue so pale it reminded her of hospital sheets.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Vina said, coming up with that smile that never held her own teeth with anything but contempt. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Aduh. The champion is kissing the track.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Dara said, breath choppy. She sat up. Her shin throbbed with the ache that says it will grow into a dark bad-looking bruise and be a story later. She could feel grit sticking to the blood.\n\n\u201cIt was just a stumble,\u201d Naya said. She offered a hand. Dara didn\u2019t take it.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d said Pak Bram, and the word cut everything else.\n\nShe stood. The tangle at the fourth hurdle had resolved itself into nothing now, or into something that had been scuffed away. Her bag by the fence was only a bag. She went again. She did not fall. The next set she took with the blind loyalty of a dream. When she finished, she could already feel the punishing conversation that would follow. She took her bottle again and tried not to glance down into the mouth of it for anything that might have floated in.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d said the coach finally, as if he had kept himself from saying it for years and now was paying himself back in one syllable. He stomped to them. \u201cDara.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Pak.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome.\u201d He walked away from the group toward the lane marker painted like an old scar.\n\nShe followed, wiping grit from her knees and smearing it wider until she stopped, embarrassed at her own hand, and let it alone.\n\n\u201cYou have to deal with this.\u201d He gestured without looking at the hurdles, at the track, at her face that probably still had one drop of blood near her lip. \u201cThis thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t seem to know. You are the fastest on this team at 400 with barriers. You have a chance to go to Jakarta again next month and maybe further. You can\u2019t do that if you stop because\u2026\u201d He searched for the word. \u201cBecause a small animal walks nearby. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\n\nShe felt the skin on her chest tighten. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop because\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did. I see it. You see it before your feet see the hurdle, and when you do, your hips go back like you\u2019re an old man carrying a sack of rice. You are not an old man. You are my runner. Tahan. Hold.\u201d He set two fingers against her sternum. It was not tender. \u201cYou have to hold.\u201d\n\nThe stadium had more wind now. It found her sweat and made it feel like fish scales.\n\n\u201cI can hold,\u201d she said, and her voice either broke or was broken by some small pressure.\n\nHe watched her for a long second. His face, which could harden into a concrete slab when he wanted the boys to stop laughing and get serious, softened in a way he probably didn\u2019t know how to show. \u201cYou can. I know you can. But you have to choose to. Otherwise what am I doing here? You think I like waking up to watch you run into the ground like a cow? I want to be proud. I want to be proud and drink coffee at noon and say to my friends, \u2018That one is my girl.\u2019 So. Stop looking. Stop thinking. Hm?\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cYes, Pak.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Now, clean your leg. We go again in twenty.\u201d He left before she could nod again. He liked to leave on his own lines.\n\nShe stood there a moment and watched the air move the grass beyond the lanes in waves like a hand smoothing something that was not hair, not a shirt, something alive that needed to be calmed. When she bent to roll her sock down and see the shin, the blood had drawn a line like someone had tried to mark her for identification.\n\n\u201cYou want my antiseptic?\u201d Naya had come up quietly. She held a small bottle that looked like it had seen too much action in small bathrooms.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Dara said. She took the bottle and the cotton. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHush. If we let you bleed, Vina will brag she beat you because you fainted.\u201d Naya smiled with only her eyes. She always saved the actual curve of her mouth for later.\n\nThey cleaned the scrape and taped it. The dull throb turned into a warmed coin spread under the skin. Dara could deal with that. Pain was easy. Pain was ancient.\n\n\u201cIs he right?\u201d Naya asked finally, as if she had said hello after an entire day. \u201cAbout why you stop?\u201d\n\nDara laughed in a way that made no sound. \u201cI see things sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of people hate them. They\u2019re not nice to look at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate the look. It\u2019s the\u2026 the moving. The quick. The surprise. They don\u2019t belong and then they do, suddenly, and the place becomes theirs. My head becomes theirs.\u201d She kept quiet for a second, aware she had said too much. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid if you feel it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is stupid because I am not eight years old in a banana plantation. I am not\u2014\u201d She stopped. She had already said too much.\n\nNaya nodded like she\u2019d known where Dara\u2019s sentence ended for a long time. \u201cSometimes the body keeps talking about things after we think the conversation is over.\u201d\n\nDara handed back the bottle. \u201cKayak tukang bakso who keeps shouting even when he passes your street.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Naya laughed. The court beyond the fence had started to fill with futsal players whose jerseys didn\u2019t match and who had more enthusiasm than any of them. \u201cEat something after. You go to hospital later?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d The word tensed her tongue. \u201cHe has a new number.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe blood?\u201d Naya kept her tone light, but her eyes, again, did the seeing. Everyone who has been to a hospital enough knows how many numbers there are and what they are worth.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to come?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Thank you.\u201d She didn\u2019t say she wanted to go alone because Rafi told better jokes when it was just the two of them, because he would mock the way she sat on the edge of the bed like a hawk ready to skewer anything, because he would ask for her earphones and pretend to hate her playlist and then ask for it again.\n\nThey went back to the track as the mist lifted fully and left the lanes like an unmade bed. Dara ran. She ran as if the stadium were the only place that would hold her, as if the city behind the wall would, at any moment, lift itself up and walk away. She ran until the muscles in her back sang in a flat tired voice. She went home by an angkot that smelled like fried noodles and cheap cologne. She sat by the window and let the city\u2019s streets string themselves past: the toko roti her mother liked because the bread was always too sweet, the school gate where students hung in clusters like grapes, the billboard with a bright picture of a phone she couldn\u2019t afford that told her she was behind, behind, behind.\n\nAt her house, her mother had left the window open to let the rain-smell out. The living room had a peeled leather sofa that had been new when her stepfather showed up with it after the wedding. He insisted that a sofa said things about a family. Dara had said nothing. She had not touched the sofa for two days after the delivery, which made her mother laugh and then cry. People have odd instincts about territory.\n\n\u201cSudah pulang?\u201d her mother called from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cUdah,\u201d Dara said. \u201cYou made something?\u201d\n\n\u201cCilok. Your brother\u2019s favorite. But he can only have a little. No pepper.\u201d\n\nDara smiled, then shaped her face into something casual and not greedy. \u201cI\u2019ll wash first.\u201d\n\n\u201cJangan lama. The taxi to Rumkit Hasan will be here in half an hour.\u201d\n\nShe went to the bathroom and washed her face, her hands, her legs. She stared at the purple bruises on her shin and thought of a map, a place you could only get to by making the wrong turn at least twice.\n\nIn her room, the wall held the medals that meant something and the medals that meant nothing but looked nice because they were round and shiny. A photograph of her father\u2014her first father\u2014stood on the desk in a cheap frame that had lost a corner. He had been a man whose wrists never sat easy; someone had always told him to do something else since he had been born. He had left when she was twelve and then one day had not been part of any more stories. Her mother had filled life with other things: a job at the laundry on Jalan Buah Batu, a stepfather with a motorcycle and an opinion on everything, a boy who was the stepfather\u2019s and then was hers too. Sometimes you adopt each other without discussion.\n\nShe sat on the edge of her bed and, with a careful slowness that was neither superstition nor faith, reached into her shoe to check it was empty. She had learned to do this with the indifference of a person who had taught herself not to puke when she did. Her fingers found only the smooth insole and a little grit in the heel.\n\nShe took a breath that made the back of her throat buzz. She took a second one because the first had felt useful.\n\n\u201cDara!\u201d her mother called.\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d Dara called back, and the sound spun off the walls.\n\nThe hospital had corridors that sounded the way sandals do on tile in the hours when errands have settled down. Every time wasn\u2019t the first time, but every time was. She never got used to the grin of the sanitizer dispenser, the way it smacked the palm and made your hands smell like a hotel that promises you everything. She never got used to the way they ended up walking slower when they reached the ward. Practicing leisure for a place that has none.\n\nRafi sat cross-legged on the bed with the IV line barely moving and his hair trying to be hair again. His eyes had learned to be older and then had gone back to whatever age they wanted when he was with her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he said, with the kind of smile that made the nurses forgive him for everything.\n\n\u201cI brought music,\u201d she said, ignoring the accusation because he enjoyed it. She set her bag down. \u201cAnd news. And I\u2019m sweaty so you\u2019re lucky you can\u2019t smell me through the mask.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeh. You always smell like stadium soup.\u201d He leaned back, exaggerated a swoon. \u201cWhat news? Is the coach still a rock with a watch?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is more of a watch with a rock attached.\u201d She pulled a chair up to the bed, felt the leg catch on the edge of the rug someone had put to make the room not a room. \u201cHe told me to stop looking.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood advice. Most things are uglier when you look.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re ugly when I look,\u201d she said, and he laughed the way people laugh when they live inside a body that hurts often: carefully, but with real light.\n\n\u201cHow many today?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive sets. Then he yelled. Then I made him proud. A little.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything you do you do loud, even if you don\u2019t speak. You don\u2019t need a coach to yell for you.\u201d\n\nShe wondered if he knew about the stop, about the aimless fear that had knocked into her like a small animal hitting your ankle when you\u2019re trying to climb stairs. She wondered how much she let him see when she pretended not to. She didn\u2019t want to be another thing that needed nurse eyes.\n\nHe took her hand and squinted at the bruises. \u201cYou fell.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. The hurdle and I had a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should see the other guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other guy is metal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister fought a machine and survived. Nice. Did you get video?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhy do you want everything in your head to be on a screen?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause my head is weird sometimes.\u201d He tapped his temple with one finger, making a small rhythm. The IV tape quivered. \u201cThe screen is like a window. You can decide when to look out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how windows work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my house they do.\u201d\n\nShe would have let the joke sit there, because she liked it when he played with light that way, but his mother\u2014her stepmother\u2014appeared at the door with a look that said she was gathering things. Her hair, once always a tight bun, had softened into a practical knot with strands that seemed to choose their own work.\n\n\u201cKita doa dulu,\u201d she said. \u201cThe doctor will come. After that, we will see the blood, and then we will see what we will do.\u201d She looked like she wanted to perform calm for everyone and then sit in the bathroom and let her breath stall.\n\nThey prayed. Dara tried to make her thoughts small and clean. She was always bad at this part. Her brain wanted to run laps during prayer. Her brain wanted to test its own pace. She gave up and just said thanks in as many ways as she could think: for the bed not creaking under Rafi when he turned; for the nurse who had told him a ridiculous joke about cucumbers yesterday; for the morning that had moved forward without asking her to promise anything.\n\nAfter the doctor came and said things about counts and numbers and how they were already, thankfully, creeping. He didn\u2019t use the word miracle because you\u2019re not allowed to in a coat, but there was something in his face that refused to be neutral. A little lift. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he does with this next cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s strong.\u201d\n\nWhen he left, a nurse leaned in and took a reading. She made the professional face. When she turned, she made a small smile at Dara that was almost a private conspiratorial thing: I know you. You did good by showing up. The gesture was quick and vanished. Sometimes the humans do that at hospitals. They opt for kindness between tasks. People act like it is nothing. It saves lives in inches.\n\nRafi was quiet, his chin tucked, the way he got when he was about to say something he had rehearsed. \u201cI saw a spider today,\u201d he said softly, playful on the first syllable and then not.\n\nShe felt the blood pull down in the back of her throat. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the window. On the outside. Not\u2026 It was like the smallest. The wind moved and it tried to stay. It was doing something impossible and refusing to admit it. It made me feel brave for\u2026 I don\u2019t know why. You would have hated it.\u201d He looked at her. They were not ones for direct looks; the family was made of people who preferred side glances and jokes. He looked at her and said it. \u201cYou\u2019re not okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fell,\u201d she said again. \u201cThe hurdle had an opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then there was\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t say the word. It caught like a laugh in the wrong part of the throat.\n\nHe squeezed her hand once. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to run all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do, actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. You want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. And?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all. That\u2019s enough often.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at her mother at the other end of the room, neatly arranging the biscuits as if their order would encourage some organ to behave. Her stepfather was not there. He had taken an extra shift at the workshop. He did that when he didn\u2019t know what to do with his hands; he took machines apart and then put them back together to prove something to himself.\n\n\u201cCan you\u2026 When you are on the track, can you imagine something else? Like the spider is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. It came out like paper tearing. \u201cIf I imagine anything, it comes. That\u2019s how it works. That\u2019s how it\u2019s worked since\u2014\u201d She stopped. He waited. She obeyed herself. \u201cSince I was a kid. I stuck my hand in a bunch of banana leaves and there was a nest. They scattered and then regrouped on my wrist like I was a new branch. You can have a whole army on you and it feels like you have invited them. After that, any time\u2026 It\u2019s like they have the only subs that don\u2019t sub out. You know what I mean?\u201d\n\nHe squeezed the hand again. \u201cI know what you mean. But. You are good at telling your body to do what you want. I\u2019ve seen it. You tell it and it listens. Mine doesn\u2019t do that most days. I tell it and it laughs.\u201d\n\nShe was about to protest, to tell him he was unlucky and she was lucky and that the universe assigned uneven loads of unfairness like a teacher who got bored and handed out punishments to the wrong kids. He lifted a finger to his mouth, a shh, a warm one, not an admonition. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be scared of what scares you,\u201d he said. \u201cJust don\u2019t be bored by it. That\u2019s when it bites.\u201d\n\nThey watched a clip on her phone of a hurdler in Europe taking ten perfect strides between each obstacle, each footfall the same argument resolved each time with the same conclusion. \u201cLook at her,\u201d Rafi said. \u201cShe\u2019s not the fastest. She\u2019s the most honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means she\u2019s not lying to her own legs. She doesn\u2019t ask them to forget that they are legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should write these on the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. In here.\u201d He tapped his head again. \u201cThe nurses think I\u2019m practicing for a drum circle.\u201d\n\nWhen she left that evening, the light had turned the building gold in a way that made everything feel like it had been paid for. She walked the corridor and caught herself thinking of a particular corner where she had once seen a spider squat like a punctuation mark. She did not look at the corner. She would not give it the courtesy. It could have the wall. It could not have her. She stepped outside into air that held all the exhaust of the day and all the fried promises of street food.\n\nAt home, her stepfather was on the sofa with the television flinging the news at him without asking for consent. He glanced at her and then back at the screen because daughters were not a type of news he knew how to report. \u201cHow,\u201d he said, flat.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cNumbers good.\u201d\n\nHe grunted. She wanted to hate him for making love sound like accounting, but he had cried once in the kitchen with his head in the sink and he had let her see it because he had had nowhere else to put the salt.\n\nShe ate cold rice and the cilok that she didn\u2019t tell her mother was too chewy and then she went to her room and lay down and thought of everything she had to do tomorrow and everything she had to avoid doing tomorrow. Her mind drew a little map where the stadium was in the middle, and around it were circles she had to run to get to a gate that would not open unless, unless\u2014what? She couldn\u2019t explain her own head even to herself. She laughed again in the dark because the laugh made the dark less smug.\n\nIn the morning, she woke before the call to prayer, her body remembering an appointment that the world had not yet made. She went to the stadium. The lane felt like a friend who sometimes told you truths you didn\u2019t want and sometimes just sat beside you. People were late because it was Wednesday and everything is slow on Wednesdays. She walked along the inside edge of the track and spotted a small, dead spider near the drain.\n\nIt lay on its back, like a fallen soldier that never learned to die in a way that didn\u2019t look melodramatic. Part of her wanted to kick it into the water that had gathered there like a mirror for small things. She stood over it and felt the little jump of disgust that was almost a habit. She breathed in. She said the word in her head that she had refused to say. Spider. Laba-laba. She said it again and again until the word was just sound, until the sound lost meaning and it became a drumbeat. The beat had nothing to do with the animal. It was a syllable. People made syllables into gods and enemies all the time. She would not give this one that honor or that hatred.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said a voice. Vina. Always early when she could be seen. \u201cWhat you doing? Praying to the insects?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an insect,\u201d Dara said, softly enough for herself.\n\n\u201cOh, excuse me, Wikipedia.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Naya said, appearing like a small honest secret, like someone you forgot you had promised yourself you would be. \u201cWarm up?\u201d\n\nThey ran in easy circles, the kind that made your knees remember a younger time when your body didn\u2019t care that it was working; it thought play had just decided to grow a plan. The sky was mean and grey. The coach had not arrived yet. For ten minutes, they laughed at a dog that found a bit of tape and shook its head as if the tape were tapping back. For five minutes, they were alive in a way that made everything they had to do later feel like something that could be done.\n\nWhen the coach arrived, he was already frowning. \u201cWe have a visitor,\u201d he said, and they all stared at him. He pointed to the bleachers. A man in a soft jacket and neat shoes sat with his phone in his hand like it was a part of his blood. \u201cSponsor,\u201d the coach said. \u201cMaybe. If we don\u2019t behave stupid.\u201d\n\nThey lined up. They did what people do when new eyes arrive. They made their movement clean and crisp. Vina lifted off her block like a flame that had decided to pretend to be metal. Naya steered her breath like a conductor. Dara did not alter her stride as much as she wanted to because she knew the price of performance, because she could not afford the after cost.\n\nOn the third set of hurdles, during the return run, a small piece of paper fluttered across lane two and landed on her path. It shocked her with how her chest clenched. What became a spider, what becomes something else. A paper was not a body; it was as alive as a bucket. She planted, she lifted, she landed. The paper clung to her shoe for a second, then came off. The sponsor watched. The coach watched the sponsor. The morning watched them all like an indifferent old person who had seen better athletes, better deals, better excuses.\n\nAfter, the sponsor clapped in a way that suggested he was made of compliments, not of bone. He told them about shoes and opportunity and social media. He told them about how running could be a platform. He looked at Dara and held the look half a second longer than he had held the others. This made Vina\u2019s mouth do something too quick to be categorized. \u201cWe\u2019re all about stories,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city loves stories. You have a story, I think.\u201d He said it the way a fishing boat captain might say, I know this bay has sharks.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a story,\u201d Dara said, carefully tight.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut not everyone\u2019s story is\u2026 visible.\u201d\n\nWhen he had left, the coach patted Dara on the shoulder in a gesture that belonged to fathers in films. \u201cThis is good,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not make it a bad thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said, but some part of her was already making a list of everything that could go wrong if a stranger wanted to buy a piece of her life.\n\nShe went to the locker room after practice. It was concrete that had decided to be a room. The lockers had been painted a hopeful blue some years before. Now, the blue was a memory. There were shoes, a towel, a dead cricket near the drain. She opened her locker and reached for her bag and then pulled back, because when she had opened the zipper a month ago at the other stadium across town, a wolf spider had leaped out like a question you didn\u2019t want to answer. It had landed on her shoulder, and she had made a sound none of them had ever heard her make. Vina had told the story three times in three different groups. By the end, the spider had been as big as a fist and had tried to take her medal.\n\n\u201cJust open it,\u201d she whispered. Her own voice was trying to act like a coach. It didn\u2019t even know where its whistle was.\n\nShe got the bag down to the bench and put it there. She put her palm flat against the rubber entire face of the thing and waited for the feeling in her hand to become normal. She pulled the zipper slowly. She saw fabric, shoes, a towel. A small hair caught in the teeth. No movement. She let herself look longer. She had to. She had to be able to see a thing for what it was for more than half a second or she would never outrun this. She would trip at a shadow and call it a predator.\n\nNothing. She took her towel and closed the bag and sat down and laughed in a real laugh that made one of the younger girls look at her as if she had said a marvelous lie.\n\nWhen she walked out of the locker room, she nearly collided with Vina, who had been waiting in a pose like a magazine. \u201cInterview,\u201d Vina said, tapping her phone. \u201cPeople asked who fell yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you tell them a meteor hit me?\u201d Dara said.\n\n\u201cI told them you saw your ex.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an ex.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Pity.\u201d Vina put the phone away. \u201cIt\u2019s all content, right?\u201d\n\nDara resisted the urge to wipe her hands on her shorts. \u201cI don\u2019t have content. I have legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have fear. People like that. They can be holy about it.\u201d Vina tilted her head. \u201cTell me something, ya. You ever think that those of us who are not scared are bored?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou? You\u2019re bored with your own shadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love my shadow. It\u2019s the only thing that keeps up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are you always behind in races?\u201d\n\nVina laughed with genuine delight and the strange creature she turned into over the last ten meters of any hundred, where she could find teeth even on her elbows, disappeared, replaced by a girl whose father sold used tires and who had learned to make fun of herself before anyone else could. \u201cYou got me,\u201d she said. \u201cHey. Come tonight. Cafe near Braga. There\u2019s music. You need to be seen by people who are not wearing a stopwatch.\u201d\n\nDara thought of the hospital, of Rafi\u2019s eyes when he decided he would probably be alive at night and maybe wanted someone to tell him something he could not guess. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, and then softened it. \u201cNext time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say next time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne time it will be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to make it true.\u201d Vina flung a lazy salute and went, walking as if people were photographing her even while alone.\n\nDara took the angkot home. She ate with her mother and told her accountably cheerful lies and then she went to the hospital with a book she was never going to finish. Rafi was drowsy but not dreamy. He looked at her and then at the book and then at her again. \u201cRead me what you think is good.\u201d\n\nShe read until the page stopped pretending to be a page and became a river that ate the edges of the room. She read until he slept. She read after the sleep, quietly, because the words had turned into something that made the chairs less ugly. When she closed the book finally, she looked at the window. A small strand of web caught dawn\u2019s rumor hour light. There was no spider. She said the word again, without hatred and without worship. She folded it into a breath. Then she put it away.\n\nThe next day, the sponsor called the coach. The coach told them they were going to have a meeting, maybe sign a thing. Vina wore lipstick under her mask and Dara wore the plain face that had taken her this far. They sat in an office that smelled like air conditioning and new carpet. The sponsor asked her about her story. She said she ran. He asked her why. She said because. He asked her if she had any challenges. She laughed and said she had a brother whose counts had decided to play games and a coach whose heart had decided to be rude by caring too much. He told her she spoke like a television. She hated that a bit. But she smiled. It was not the time to teach the room how to talk.\n\nWhen she left, the coach touched her shoulder again. The touch had begun to become a habit. Habits are another way of agreeing with the world.\n\nLater, she sat on her bed and stretched and winced when the bruise reminded her it had been promoted to full pain. She scrolled through her phone. There were messages. The big group chat choked on its own jokes. Someone had posted a video from yesterday\u2014her stumble. Of course they had. The camera shook and the image was not humiliating so much as it was true. She was not a superhero. She was someone who could be wrong-footed by a small shadow. The comments had begun. They were many. Some were mean in the way people are mean when they are bored and want something to punch on their way to the bus. Some were supportive like a pillow that you put your face into and find too soft. Some said the word. Some wrote it like a threat. Some wrote it like a prayer.\n\nShe typed and then untyped a reply, a defense, a joke, a story. She put the phone down. She got up. She went to the kitchen where the tile was so old and white it had begun to decide to be yellow. She took an orange and decided to peel it like a person who had time. The peel came off in a spiral. She held it up like a little snake and then laughed at herself because she was being dramatic, because she always would be, because she was made that way before anyone had told her who she was supposed to be to make money from. She ate the sections one by one, the sting in her mouth like a new thought.\n\nWhen she lay down, the city was not quiet, but it was not the kind of loud that broke you. It was the loud that tells you you\u2019re part of a place and that place does not need you, and somehow that makes you feel safer because you can be there without earning it. She slept and dreamed that the hurdles were made of water and she had to run through them, not over them, and when she did, she came out on the other side wet but whole, and someone was clapping. Maybe the someone was her. Maybe it was a boy with tired eyes who laughed too loudly at cucumber jokes. Maybe it was the city, that old person again, clapping once, softly, for luck.Rain came in a fine sheet that made the red track look newly painted, and the stadium became a bowl of breath again, full of the sound of feet deciding what kind of day it would be. They did starts in the wet because most of the races that matter are run in weather that refuses to pick a side, and the way a foot meets slickness is part of a language you have to learn before you deserve to speak. Pak Bram told them they would have entries confirmed for Jakarta if the next two weeks didn\u2019t betray them, and he said it in the same tone he used when he said don\u2019t cut corners, the tone of an old promise he still believed in. \u201cWaktu target bukan doa,\u201d he said, and even though he tried to make it a joke, the stopwatch dangling from his neck swung like a pendulum that had been counting the same prayer since he was young. Vina ran with her shoulders daring the rain to get intimate; she said between sets that wet weather made the camera like her more and then laughed because she pretended not to care if the camera liked her, and Naya made a face and said, \u201cCamera likes everyone who moves like they mean it,\u201d and then glanced at Dara with that sideways honesty of hers that felt like a hand offered without announcement. Dara rolled a small stone beneath her shoe during a rest and told her calf to behave, and when the wind lifted a plastic bag past lane four like a ghost that had misinterpreted its own assignment, she let it be only a bag and refused to translate it into anything else. The brain is a liar, she told the rain in her head, and the body knows, and the body answered in the clean language of tendons sliding under skin.\n\nThe social media video had gone a little wider than anyone wanted; an aunt messaged her a sticker of a cat falling down stairs, a stranger told her she had to do yoga for her chakras, a boy from school she hadn\u2019t spoken to since last year wrote to say he believed in her like he had free belief to give away, and the sponsor\u2019s assistant had forwarded a link with a smiley face, which made her want to hit something soft. \u201cYou read comments?\u201d Naya asked in a breath that tried to be casual and failed with dignity, and Dara said, \u201cI scrolled until my finger remembered it had other work,\u201d and Naya said, \u201cGood,\u201d and that was the conversation they could have when they were running and life was measured in meters. After the last set, while they were shaking their legs and trying to convince the day to be kind, the coach said there would be a meeting after, someone from the sponsor wanted images, \u201ckonten kreatif,\u201d the words tasted like a syrup that had been in the cabinet too long, and he told them to be smart enough not to look stupid. \u201cNo drama,\u201d he added, and Vina grinned and said she was born allergic to no drama, and he aimed a scolding at her that landed softly, because it was raining and even his bark had gotten wet.\n\nThe hospital let Rafi ride a wheelchair to the rooftop garden after lunch because his numbers had behaved like good students for three days, and the nurse winked like she was granting a criminal a night off. The garden was a rectangle of stubborn green standing up to a city that had tried for years to convince plants they were old news; the benches had flaking paint in cheerful colors that were trying not to apologize for their shabby sincerity. A woman in a cheap blazer was crying on the phone near the jasmine and didn\u2019t notice anyone else, a child in a Spider-Man shirt kicked at nothing because nothing was the only thing that could take a kick without complaint, and a volunteer swept water from a corner and hummed a song from 1998 like she was still twenty. Rafi tilted his face to the grey and said he could taste the metal in the air and it was delicious because it tasted like outside, and Dara said she preferred her metal in hurdles and he said he preferred his metal in jokes. They watched a tiny bead of water find its way along a spider silk stretched between a railing and a leaf, and when it reached the dip, it paused because even water thinks before deciding some days, and then it dropped with a thrum so slight you had to want to hear it. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked without turning, and she said, \u201cI am tired of being interesting to myself,\u201d and he laughed and winced and said, \u201cSame,\u201d and then he went quiet the way he did when pain was coming up the elevator to their floor. She talked through it later, telling him about a dog at the stadium that had decided to adopt a piece of tape and lead it around like a pet, and he told her about a nurse who had told him his eyebrows were reliable, and they both let silence have its turn, because you have to share silence in a family or it becomes an enemy.\n\nThe content team wanted an old warehouse near the river because brick photographs well, and they wanted morning light, and they wanted \u201cauthentic movement,\u201d which made Dara want to show them a full practice and watch them try to keep up with the ugliness of a good session. The producer was a woman with glossy hair and a voice that would have sold rain to Bandung in November, and she said, \u201cWe love your energy,\u201d after saying hello, which was a sentence that made no sense and made perfect sense. A young man who wore his headphones around his neck like a scarf had a mood board on his phone, and when he turned it toward Dara she saw a picture of an athlete bursting through paper that had been cut like a web, and across it someone had typed in a font that looked casual on purpose: Face Your Fears. She took a breath and felt her stomach tense the way a hand does when it sees a candle and wants to know if it will hurt. She said, \u201cI won\u2019t do webs,\u201d and the producer blinked with surprise that was quickly covered with competence, and she smiled like flexibility was her birthright and said, \u201cOf course, of course, we will pivot, we are storytellers, not\u2026 designers,\u201d and then she turned to the young man and said in perfect polite Bahasa, \u201cGanti konsep ya,\u201d and he nodded and scrolled like the future was a menu. Naya, who had agreed to come as moral support and also because free snacks were free snacks, stood just close enough that Dara could feel the agreement without words, and Pak Bram arrived late because he had made the mistake of believing a friend who said Jalan Sudirman would not be jam at nine in the morning, and he said, \u201cNo lompat-lompat yang bodoh,\u201d as if that phrase could hold back the century.\n\nThey made her run across loose gravel while a drone made a sound like a dentist\u2019s daydream and a photographer in a shirt with tiny cameras printed on it shouted directions that sounded like prayers. \u201cLook at the horizon, think of something you want,\u201d he said, and she thought of a thousand small square meals that arrived in the ward on time and warm; he said, \u201cCan you give me determination,\u201d and she wanted to ask what wattage that came in; he said, \u201cLower your jaw,\u201d and she relaxed her mouth and thought about nothing because nothing is sometimes the only honest thing left. Vina arrived halfway through with clean lipstick and a speed that she put on like a jacket, and the room\u2019s attention shifted the way it always does when someone enters with a relationship to light, and she played with the lens in a way that dared it to try to capture her whole. \u201cYou see,\u201d the producer said to Dara between takes with the bright intimacy of temporary comrades, \u201ceveryone\u2019s different, I want your quiet,\u201d and Dara made a face she hoped read as grateful and not as the small animal sound she felt in the back of her throat. Someone set a coil of rope near the corner and someone else tripped over the coil and swore with the melodrama of youth, and Dara watched the coil, and for a second her brain announced that it had eight legs, and then she breathed and it became a coil again, and she moved her eyes, because you don\u2019t have to challenge every shadow to a duel.\n\nAt home, the workshop smell had followed her stepfather like a second jacket, oil and heat and the old sadness of machines that will never be new again. He set a can of insect spray on the kitchen counter as if he were presenting a trophy to the house, and he said, \u201cKalau di kamar ada, semprot aja,\u201d and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make the room smell like murder,\u201d and he grunted in a way that could be read three ways and she chose the kindest. He stood there, hands on the back of a chair like he was steadying a ship, and then he said in a voice that had not been sanded smooth by time with her yet, \u201cWaktu kecil saya juga takut,\u201d and when she looked at him with more face than she intended, he looked away like the wall had asked him a question, and he said he had fallen into a flood at Cicalengka when he was nine, and the water had been a living thing with things in it, leeches and plastic bags and a snake and a chair that had decided to float by, and for years after that he could not shower with the drain uncovered because the sound made his knees think the river had come back. \u201cSampai sekarang kadang masih,\u201d he admitted with a little embarrassed laugh that had dust in it, and she said, \u201cOkay,\u201d because what else do you say to someone making a bridge he didn\u2019t know how to finish, and he nodded and picked up the can and put it back in a cupboard because he had heard her, which was new currency in the house. Her mother came in with a bowl of tempe bacem like the smell would solve arguments, and she asked them if they had eaten, and they said yes even though they had not, because sometimes love starts with a lie that spares the cook for five minutes.\n\nThere were mornings when the stadium emptied of everything that wasn\u2019t running, a spell where the birds took their meetings elsewhere and the futsal boys slept in and even the cleaners delayed, and on one of those mornings they did a time trial because you have to practice fear at the same pace as you will meet it. \u201cYou run the whole set like it owes you money,\u201d Pak Bram said to the group, and he gave Dara a look that had the edges filed down, and she ran lane three the way you run when you suspect this version of yourself is the best one you\u2019ll get today. The first two hurdles rose and fell like questions she had memorized answers to and not in a way that made her feel fraudulent; the third carried the shimmer of a remembered mistake and she refused it entry; the fourth was positioned where the old tangle had been and her lungs flickered, and she said the word in her head without glue, laba-laba, laba-laba, until it became percussion, and she kept her hips where he\u2019d asked her to keep them, over the legs, not behind, and she landed with a sound that the track accepted. By the seventh, the world had narrowed to a corridor of breath and white bars and she felt the ache under her right shoulder that always arrived like a friend who needed a place to stay for the weekend and then cleaned up after themselves, and she smiled into the rain because even pain could be polite. When she stopped, her time was there on the coach\u2019s screen and it wore a tiny grin that belonged to numbers that had decided to be generous, and he grunted in a way that meant he would brag later without making it a transcript. \u201cDi ulang,\u201d he said, because you never celebrate the first good attempt, and she nodded because ritual is part of technique.\n\nAfter the second run, she walked with Naya along the grass because the lane can be jealous if you never leave it, and Naya told her about a cousin who had called to say she had seen the video and that fear wasn\u2019t a good brand and that she should tell Dara to get over it. \u201cAneh orang,\u201d Naya said, pushing a seed head with her shoe, \u201clike she never cried when the electricity died and she thought ghosts wanted her Netflix,\u201d and they laughed in the low way you laugh when you know laughter is one of the only therapies you can afford. Dara said she had an appointment at the hospital later because Rafi was due to change to a different regimen and everyone had to pretend to understand the math of it, and Naya squeezed her elbow, a small pressure that said she didn\u2019t have to tell stories to keep company, the company would stay anyway. The futsal boys bustled in like a parade of misfitting jerseys and someone\u2019s speaker played a song from summer, and the morning gave up its quiet with a shrug.\n\nThe sponsor\u2019s representative messaged with angles and metrics and asked Dara if she would be comfortable telling \u201ca little bit about your challenge,\u201d and she typed, \u201cI run the 400 hurdles,\u201d and sent it, and the typing bubble froze and then revived and then the answer came back with three laughing emojis and a gentle pivot, and she didn\u2019t give him anything else because not every truth was a bar of gold you chip off to pay a bill. Vina sent a selfie with the producer captioned \u201cMy new mom,\u201d and a second later another message, \u201cKamu juga ya jangan jadi anak tiri,\u201d and a little heart, and Dara didn\u2019t know whether to be warmed or warned, so she let the message sit without an answer until it fermented into nothing. She stood at the sink and peeled an orange again because she had decided the fruit was a practice, and when the skin came off in two pieces instead of one she didn\u2019t make it a metaphor, she just ate.\n\nIn the ward, Rafi had the look he got after the drip had been going long enough to make his jokes slower; he was still himself but the edges had been sanded and he was a little more tender to the touch without being sad about it. He asked her about the old warehouse shoot and she told him about the rope and the pivot and the drone that had tried to pretend to be a mosquito, and he asked if they\u2019d paid her extra for the rain and she said, \u201cThey paid me attention,\u201d and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s a currency that depreciates,\u201d and she threw a biscuit wrapper at him and he clutched his chest like a soap opera actor. Their mother\u2014his mother\u2014sat on the edge of the chair with her bag in her lap like the bag might get up and leave if not supervised, and she told them about a neighbor whose son had quit school to ride Gojek and who was now making more money than his father and how money didn\u2019t choose sides, it just wore the shirt of whoever showed up first, and they listened because listening was free and made people stand up straighter. The doctor came and did his polite summary and left behind a diagram that tried to make blood polite too, and when the room was theirs again, Dara said, \u201cEvery time I think I\u2019ve got it, my head plays me back a film I don\u2019t want to watch,\u201d and Rafi said, \u201cThen we make a new film on top until the old one is hard to see,\u201d and she said, \u201cWhat are the scenes,\u201d and he said, \u201cFirst scene is you eating all my pudding,\u201d and she said, \u201cI can do method for that,\u201d and their mother made a sound that came from a place before language and smoothed the sheet for the third time, and the machine beeped the way machines do when they are trying to be reassuring and failing but trying matters.\n\nOn a Thursday, the coach did a thing no one expected and asked a woman in a hijab and track pants with a posture that had not forgotten sprinting to come and watch them for an hour. He said her name was Bu Rara and that she had once run the two hundred until her hamstrings had decided to be dramatic, and now she worked with heads for a living; he said this like he was admitting to having a cousin in television. She watched them move and asked quiet questions that made it sound like she wanted to know what each of their shoes had to say, and she asked Dara between sets, \u201cWhat do you do when the picture shows up,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cI tell my legs they are not a screen,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood, and then what,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cI breathe until the syllable becomes only a syllable,\u201d and she nodded like that was a tool she would steal if she could and asked if she ever let the fear get bored, and Dara laughed and said that line belonged to her brother and she was just renting it. After, the coach hovered like a teacher trying to pretend not to hope for extra credit, and the woman told him they had good bones and dirty habits, and they could clean them, and he snorted because he does not believe in tidy minds, only in work, but he listened, which is a form of faith.\n\nThere was a day when the drain at the far corner failed and the track held a shallow lake with an ambition, and someone found a frog floating in an expression of resignation, and Vina squealed and jumped up on the bleacher like the frog had a grudge, and Naya coaxed it toward the grass with a shoe like she was negotiating with a bureaucrat. Dara watched from a distance where the frog could be a frog, and then a breeze unrolled a web between two posts like a tiny flag at half-mast, and there, at the center, a spider no larger than the head of a pencil sat in an attitude of ownership, and she felt the old electricity climb her spine like a song you cannot stop hearing because you were fourteen when you heard it on a bus. She did not walk toward it because courage does not always look like proximity, but she did not re-route her warm-up either; she let it be the corner\u2019s corner, and she ran her arcs and her steps and her drills with the exactness of a person filing away one day that will not be the day she breaks, and when a lace came loose she did not make it a message. Later, while packing her bag, she stuck her hand into a shoe without making a ceremony of it, and when her fingers found only the insole and the grit and not a small panic with legs, she smiled with her whole face because you should let yourself have your own victories.\n\nThe message confirming her lane assignment for Jakarta arrived with the tone her phone used for announcements that mattered, the one she had chosen in a moment of melodrama when she wanted her life to have trumpets. She stared at the text as if it were a person in the room and said out loud to no one, \u201cLane five,\u201d and then she said, \u201cOkay,\u201d with a long inhale that made the door to her room look like it had thought about being a finishing line. She thought of the stadium in Jakarta, of the way the sound there came off the seats like a slap, of the heat that came up off the track and made your calf talk to your patience, and she thought of Rafi\u2019s eyes when she would call and he would say, \u201cHow many steps,\u201d because he liked the math more than the result, and she thought of the sponsor\u2019s clean office and the old warehouse and the rope and the refusal and felt her mouth pull into something that was not quite a smile because the smile would come later.\n\nNight collected around the neighborhood with its usual untidy efficiency; a motorbike coughed and somebody\u2019s grandmother shouted for a child who had learned to answer at volume only when paid in fried things, and the cat that kept pretending their roof was a river crossed above with a confidence that insulted gravity. Dara lay on her bed not sleeping yet, hands behind her head like a clich\u00e9 she forgave herself for, and she traced the journey from the start to the tenth hurdle in the dark as if it were a prayer that didn\u2019t mind being touched. She remembered the banana leaves and the nest like a rumor with legs, and how her father had laughed when she told him before he left laughing altogether, and she felt the old shame tug at the hem of her breath, the shame of being taken by surprise and making a sound that betrayed you, and she said out loud to the ceiling, \u201cI forgive the sound,\u201d and the ceiling said nothing because it was a ceiling, and she left the room for a glass of water and on the way past the living room her stepfather coughed into a fist and said without looking up, \u201cBawa jas hujan ya nanti,\u201d as if rain were always possible, and she said, \u201cI will,\u201d and meant it like a promise to the city.\n\nOn Friday, the producer called to say the sponsor wanted to do a live stream after practice next week and that there would be questions from followers, some of whom would be children, which could be the cruelest audience in the world, and Dara said, \u201cNo spiders,\u201d and the producer laughed and said, \u201cWe are a brand, not a zoo,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cI like zoos; animals are honest,\u201d and the producer made a sound like a spoon on a glass and promised a set that would be nothing but lines and light. The coach, when told, rubbed his forehead as if that could refund minutes, and then said fine, but no extra running for a camera and no missing stretches for a camera, and he passed on a message from an old friend of his in Jakarta, a man who had once run the 800 like it owed him a house and who now sold rice cookers, and the message was, \u201cDon\u2019t give them your soft underbelly for free,\u201d and Dara wrote it on a scrap of paper because sometimes old men see the same wolves.\n\nThat afternoon, the sky finally cracked and gave them real rain, fat and hard and bored of being polite, and the city smelled new and rotten at the same time, and in that honest wet, the drains did their song and the track thickened and everywhere small things looked for higher ground. Dara walked the perimeter in a poncho that made her look like a conscience and watched workers prop open a door with a brick and a broom, and she stepped around a flow of water carrying leaves like tiny boats, and when a small spider, displaced and furious in the way only tiny kings can be, pinwheeled out of a drain and tried to make a claim on a patch of dry concrete, she felt her pulse go dramatic and then slow, because there was nowhere for it to go otherwise, and she said the word in her mouth quietly once for her and once for the animal, and then she kept walking because staying is sometimes an agreement you can\u2019t afford. When she reached the bleachers, Naya was there with a towel over her head like a monk and a grin she couldn\u2019t hide, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re outside,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cEveryone\u2019s outside,\u201d and Naya said, \u201cYes, but you, now,\u201d and it took Dara a breath to hear the meaning.\n\nThe coach gave them a rest day before the travel, which meant, in practice, that he told them to do the work at home where he couldn\u2019t see it, and she did, because being unsupervised is not the same as being free. She texted Rafi that she would stop by after picking up a singlet, and he replied with a sticker of a dinosaur nodding like approval, and she sat on the angkot watching a man with too many boxes pretend physics were a rumor, and she thought about the moment of the gun, how it is a tiny explosion that pretends to be official, and the four steps to the first hurdle, and the way the last two always belong to an argument between fatigue and form. She could hear the city rehearsing its part in her head, the cheer that belongs to strangers who love the idea of running more than the runner, and she decided not to resent them for that; she needed ideas too.\n\nOn the ward, a new patient had arrived, a teenager with hair bleached a color that did not exist in forests, and he had a group of friends who made too large a noise in a way that was a protest against the quiet, and Rafi watched them with the mixed expression he gave any gathering: a little envy, a little tenderness, a little anthropological interest. Dara told him about lane five and the weather forecast and the rumor that an athlete from Surabaya had gotten a new coach with a reputation for cruelty disguised as excellence, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t give the rumor your breath,\u201d and she said, \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d and he said, \u201cGood,\u201d and then he dozed in the way that made his hand heavy in hers, and she read the same paragraph three times before realizing the book wasn\u2019t the point, the chair was. Their mother came back from the canteen with a bag of crackers like she had conquered something and said she had run into a nurse who used to train for volleyball and who had said that pain on court was education and pain off court was a teacher with a stick, and they smiled because they liked it when the world kept bringing them metaphors as if language could be interest paid on suffering.\n\nShe left before the rain returned and walked past the corner where she had once refused to look, and she looked because she could, and there was nothing, and that was a kind of blessing, absence as mercy. At home, she packed with a discipline that had become habit, tape and spikes and snacks and the ridiculous little sachet that dried her hands because sometimes performance needed small cheats, and she put her shoe in the bag after checking it twice without flinching because practice had made that part unremarkable. Her stepfather knocked on the open door with all the awkwardness in the world and said, \u201cHati-hati,\u201d and then added, \u201cBangga,\u201d and then coughed because the word had surprised him, and she nodded with more face than she meant and said, \u201cMakasih,\u201d and her mother called from the kitchen that she had put fried rice in a container with a note because of course she had, and Dara said, \u201cYou put notes now,\u201d and her mother said, \u201cI put notes when I\u2019m scared,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cYou\u2019re scared,\u201d and her mother said, \u201cI\u2019m always scared,\u201d and they both laughed like a secret had been polite enough to introduce itself.\n\nThe bus pulled out of the terminal too late and too fast, the way all departures in the country do when optimism meets schedule, and she sat by the window with the glass at her shoulder cool and a thin film of dust that would become a story on her jacket. Ahead, the road unspooled its familiar promises, curves she\u2019d taken with classmates on school trips and with teammates whose names she no longer said out loud because they liked other sports now, and the driver\u2019s playlist did a tour of heartbreaks and victories that made the aisle a dance floor in someone else\u2019s imagination. Vina slept in a posture of total ownership and drooled without shame, and Naya watched trees the way a person collects green for later, and the coach pretended to be irritated by everything and secretly counted how many of them laughed without worrying about time. Dara pressed her palm flat to the window when the bus passed a stretch of fields where banana plants stood with their leaves bruised by last month\u2019s wind, and she felt the old story try to sit in the seat beside her, and she said, not out loud, not a spell, just a sentence: \u201cYou can ride, but you don\u2019t get to drive,\u201d and the story made itself smaller because she had not, this time, offered it snacks.\n\nThey crossed into a city that always pretends it is the center of the map and forgives you for believing it, and the stadium rose like a machine that had been built to hold breath, and her chest tightened in the good way because some places give you permission without asking for your credentials. In the hotel room that smelled like a thousand previous nerves, she and Naya unpacked with the ritual of a new camp: shoes under the chair, tape on the table, spare socks in the drawer because they would forget them otherwise, and snacks in the top of the cupboard because Vina would steal them if they were visible. The coach knocked and barked at them to be downstairs in ten, and they were, and he took them to see the track because you should not meet the lanes only when you are dressed to impress them; you should say hello in your ordinary clothes, in your traveling skin, so the track knows you don\u2019t want anything but mercy. The lines were whiter than home and the bars looked like they had been carved from official wood, and the wind said nothing because wind here is careful with strangers, and Dara walked lane five in flats and counted strides between empty hurdles and said the count under her breath like a psalm.\n\nThat night, in a bed that had seen every version of sleep, she lay awake longer than she liked and refused to name any of what her heart was doing, and finally she slept, and in the morning she woke before the call to prayer again because her body respects its own clock more than any bell, and she sat on the edge of the bed and tied and untied a lace while the city began its noise, and she thought of the dead spider by the drain, of the live one on a web that had survived a rooftop gust, of the rope coil at the warehouse and the boys with the drone, of her stepfather and the flood and the drain and his quiet confession, of her mother\u2019s note on the fried rice that she had eaten in the bus and the way the taste had been a childhood she hadn\u2019t noticed in years. She thought of Rafi counting her steps from a screen that would be too bright, and she thought of how he had said honesty like it was a metric, and she stood and did the things you do to make morning less wild: stretch, drink, wash, quiet your head, listen to your feet. When she met the team in the hallway, Vina bumped her shoulder with exactly the right amount of force and said, \u201cReady to be famous,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cReady to run,\u201d and Naya said, \u201cReady to breathe,\u201d and they laughed because they were all telling the truth.The morning in Jakarta perspired before the sun did. Warmth climbed up from the track as if the surface remembered all the legs that had argued upon it and wanted to whisper their sentences back at the new ones. The stadium breathed in a different rhythm from home, wider, louder, a throat that could swell in an instant. The warm-up track was a world adjacent to the world, a ring of work that smelled like rubber and old chalk and the particular sweetness of isotonic drinks that promise mercy. The call room had its own weather: a hush with corners. When they stepped in, a volunteer in a neat polo shirt and a lanyard that dimpled his chest said numbers out loud like they were names and pointed to chairs like they were assignments.\n\nDara pinned her bib with the practiced fingers of someone who has stabbed herself enough times to have earned care. Lane five, heat two. She rolled the edge of her hamstring against the stretch of a trigger ball and tried not to think of it as a lottery. The other women were versions of her and not her: a girl from Makassar with hair tight as wire and a face like a decision, a tall woman from Semarang with an expression that had eaten nerves and decided they were calories, a Jakarta athlete whose eyeliner was perfect and who would refuse to let sweat claim it. They all made little bargains with their shoes and their laces, with their shoulders, with the ghosts that had booked seats in their lungs. Vina popped in and popped out like a firecracker because her call time was later and she didn\u2019t know how to be anywhere for long without turning the place into a stage. Naya sat for a minute, quiet, a palm pressed into the back of Dara\u2019s shoulder until her hand warmed what lay under skin, and then she went to her own lane where the watch would try to measure something it didn\u2019t deserve to judge.\n\n\u201cFifteen to start,\u201d Pak Bram said softly, not looking at her because he didn\u2019t like to give the room the satisfaction of seeing him care. \u201cIf wind turns and you feel the one, decide early. No improvisasi on seven. Keep hips.\u201d He didn\u2019t say fear, didn\u2019t say picture, didn\u2019t say syllabus of phobia or ancient field report from a banana plant. He tapped twice on the top of her quad with two knuckles like someone testing fruit at a market and walked away as if he had delivered a package and had two more doors to visit before nine.\n\nThey sent them out in a small procession that tried not to look like a parade. The stadium widened and the sound, that animal that lives in concrete and plastic seats, lifted its head lazily. Dara stepped into the lane and let her eyes rest where they were meant to be: on the white lines, the takeoff marks, the quiet bar on top of the first hurdle that would be the first promise she would make and keep. The bruise on her shin had matured into a color that you could wear to a wedding if you didn\u2019t want compliments; tape held it like a considerate hand. She bounced twice, not for show, for the small interior calibration that made her ankles speak to her knees in a language no one else needed.\n\nOn your marks was not a sentence in this place. It was a ritual that asked you to believe in the flatness under your toes and the straightness of your intent. She set her blocks, felt the grippiness of the surface against palms, the cold of the pedals against spikes, the way her breath lit a small fire at the back of her throat. Set was a held photograph. The gun did not sound like a gun; it sounded like the moment lifting its face.\n\nThe first four steps were counted and not counted, done and forgotten as they needed to be. Hurdle one came and went like an old friend who doesn\u2019t require greeting. Fifteen between. Two, breath and teeth soft, the ground rising and falling on schedule. Three was positioned under a piece of shade thrown by the big screen itself, and for a half of a step her brain wanted to assign meaning to the darker, wanted to film a movement that was not there, and she answered with the drum of syllable she had practiced until it meant nothing but meter\u2014laba-laba-laba\u2014until the mouth told the eyes to relax, and the eyes obeyed because the body likes to win an argument that feels honest. Four, she held; five, she made peace early with the switch to sixteen because the headwind had made the space between the bars feel a breath longer, and that decision saved the pattern from becoming a story in which she was the wrong character. On the backstretch, the noise settled into a hum so steady it could hold a person up. At seven, her right shoulder whispered its old complaint and she told it that she had rented the pain for the day and it could have it back tomorrow. Eight, nine, the body started itemizing debts, and ten arrived like a door you already had the key for, and then she was across and the line underfoot said nothing because the line never speaks to anyone; it simply is the definition.\n\nShe didn\u2019t win the heat. The Semarang runner did, with a tiny lift near nine that looked like she had banked a surprise. Dara\u2019s eyes flicked to the clock because everyone pretends they won\u2019t and then does. The number stared back and it wore the face of a personal best by a whisker that would need a microscope, the kind of margin you could argue with if you liked losing arguments. She exhaled a sound that the microphones would probably not pick up and walked on her toes to let the acid drain where it would not complain as loudly. The sweat on her lip tasted like a welding of salt and relief. The board said her name in block letters that felt like seeing your own handwriting on a wall, familiar and strange, and the small heart she had been carrying in her mouth slid back down to where it belonged.\n\nIn the mix zone, where strangers with microphones smile with their teeth and with their eyes and with their phones, the sponsor\u2019s assistant steered two cameras away with the diplomacy of someone who knew how to protect a story long enough to sell it properly later. \u201cRecovery dulu, ya,\u201d she said in a voice that would have calmed a roomful of cats. A boy with a student press badge and a shirt that wanted to be a dress shirt asked if fear was something you could train like quads, and Dara laughed in a full sentence and told him she preferred to train her hamstrings and mind and that fear was like rain: you learned to run in it or you went inside, but it wasn\u2019t a muscle and it wasn\u2019t a friend, it was weather. The boy nodded like he had been handed a phrase he would quote to someone attractive later and she felt a little bad for him because life would give him better quotes if he waited.\n\nBack under the stands, the cool air licked at the sweat on her neck with hotel enthusiasm. Pak Bram met her with a face that had both a frown and a bitten smile hidden behind it and said, \u201cBagus. Jangan percaya bagus,\u201d because he hated the way good tries to make people sleep. He tapped the screen of his phone where the splits lived and made a small face when it told him what he already knew, that she had given up a slice at six for a salvation at eight, and then he nodded because trade-offs are sometimes wisdom. Naya came in a few minutes later with that half-smile she reserved for when she had been brave without receiving any medals for it. Vina sent eleven messages in three minutes in the team group chat that was a chaos garden: a picture of her spikes next to a complementary banana, a selfie with a volunteer who looked like they were reconsidering volunteering, a video of a puddle trying to be a lake, a joke about lane draws, a sentence that began with \u201cManifesting\u2014\u201d and a disappearing sticker. Dara drank and let the cold sit in her stomach like a gecko that would flee if she startled it, and then stood so that her quads wouldn\u2019t turn into furniture.\n\nAt the hospital, a nurse had arranged two juice boxes in a way that made them look like a polite sculpture, and Rafi watched her via a stream that had the gall to freeze every time a face looked good. He had texted the count he guessed before the race and he had missed it by one step and felt proud of being wrong because it meant she had adjusted before he had, and he loved her most when she changed the math and it still added up. He sent three claps and a gif of an old man dancing and the words \u201chonesty metric going up\u201d and she wrote back a picture of the clock with his name drawn on it in a way only siblings would find funny. Their mother had learned how to check live results with a frown like she was trying to make numbers behave with scolding, and when the page rejected her three times she scolded the page, and Rafi told her to let the page calm down because the whole city was pressing on it and the city did not know how to take turns. He felt a warmth under his tongue that he liked to pretend meant hope but the nurse would say meant the steroid at four p.m., and he kept his eyes on the small screen that showed his sister continue to be the kind of human whose body could be convinced of things.\n\nIn the afternoon, Dara sat on the hotel carpet and counted breaths while rain threatened the window in a way that turned the city into a person who promised to show up at seven and then arrived at eight with a story. She filled the time with care: flush calves, take shoes out of bag so they could remember their shape, call home and tell her mother the room was clean and the bed was comfortable and the breakfast had fruit because those were the things her mother wanted to know, part protocol and part prayer. Her stepfather, who rarely took phones into his hand the way a man who has broken his fingers on engines doesn\u2019t take kittens casually, asked, \u201cSuasana?\u201d and she said, \u201cRame,\u201d and he grunted like he approved of a full room. He did not say the word bangga this time, and she did not ask for it; sometimes a word\u2019s previous appearance is enough to earn it a day off.\n\nThe final came sooner than her nerves preferred and later than her legs wanted. The sun is a kind of coach in Jakarta; it asks for loyalty and then punishes it. They taped and warmed and did the drills that are a language, A-skips and B-skips in a grammar you do not speak until your shoes know it. The call room\u2019s air conditioner was a tyrant and a mercy and the chairs were arranged to encourage a particular kind of silence. A volunteer with a face that could have stopped a fire by speaking politely checked spikes and asked them to sign something that meant they were present. The Semarang runner looked like she belonged in any room she entered. The Makassar girl laughed at nothing in particular to show her throat that it was allowed to stay open. The Jakarta athlete examined the corner of her nail and then shook out her arms as if the track had to be told that those arms were coming.\n\nOn the way out, in that narrow corridor where sound changes shape, a small lint of something floated down from the lighting rig with the laziness of dust that believes itself to be interesting. It caught the edge of Dara\u2019s cheek and then stuck on the curve of her jaw, and for a fraction her skin crawled the old crawl, the alarm that the body has so perfected, and she put her hand up with movement that pretended to be a scratch and wiped it away as if there had never been any contact. She did not look up to see if there was anything to blame, because blame is a hobby and she was trying to give up hobbies. She walked and the corridor opened and the field opened and the lanes were white lies she was ready to believe.\n\nThe gun spoke the way it always does when the moment doesn\u2019t want to argue. The first hurdle asked only what she had already answered. The fifth, under an angle of light that made the bar look more present than it was, demanded a very small fierceness and got it. She kept fifteen because the wind had made a different promise today and her hips obeyed the course. Her arms remembered to be quiet and her face remembered to stay uninteresting. Somewhere a woman screamed a name that was not hers and somewhere else a child, convinced of his own heroism, took off on a sprint that would end in giggles before the stairs. At eight, the old dip at the shoulder visited and she didn\u2019t tell it go away; she told it hold on and go with us, because some companions are easier to keep than to fight. Nine is a place where a person can become an animal with a plan; she let her legs do the remembering they wanted to do and kept her eyes honest, not looking at the tungsten bright finish but at the place where her foot would meet the next thing. Ten was a bar like a sentence she had written a thousand times and still meant. The last forty brings an honesty you cannot buy; she found the lean without borrowing from her neck and then the line came and the line went and the lungs turned themselves inside out in a practice that would never become normal.\n\nShe did not win the final either. The Semarang woman took it in the last ten with a lean that was a whole personality trait. Dara came second, closer than she would have guessed on a night when the stadium had measured her breath like a coin it could spend. The clock was pleased with her and said so; this time there was no microscope needed. It was there, a number she wanted to write somewhere secret. She walked because walking is what you do when you have asked your blood to carry fire and it is trying to negotiate for water. She put her hands on her hips because that position had helped her breathe since she was ten and had run the length of a paddy bund to beat a storm home. She looked for the camera with Rafi on the other side of it without moving her head, the way people look for birds they don\u2019t want to spook, and she could not see him, but she could feel him telling some nurse that she kept her hips, that she had not let the picture take the lane, that she had not let weather pretend to be fate.\n\nIn the mix zone, the microphones had found larger prey and she was given the luxury of walking with only a small pack of curiosity at her heels. The sponsor appeared with the glare of a person whose shoes had not touched anything uncarpeted, his smile set to polite. He said congratulations like someone offering a napkin. He asked if she wanted to say a few words to the brand\u2019s followers, and she said a few words to the people who buy shoes with their hope and their fear, and she tried to make the words plain because plain tastes better after a race. \u201cI ran,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to be honest.\u201d The producer, who had grown a small weather antenna that could sense when a thing was enough, cut it there, and thanked her, and told her to sit down and breathe like it was a new skill they had invented together.\n\nVina arrived out of the stream with a time that didn\u2019t owe anyone an apology, buzzing because that\u2019s what she does and also because she had caffeine shaped like candy, and she kissed Dara\u2019s forehead in a moment of theatrical tenderness that contained real salt. \u201cSecond is dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you want more.\u201d Naya came and leaned against a wall with the grace of someone who could make rest into a strong pose and said, \u201cYou were good,\u201d and because it was Naya, it sounded like a sentence that carried six meanings. Pak Bram took his time coming over, not because he was withholding but because he liked to give the sound a chance to understand what it had just heard, and when he reached her he did nothing unusual, did not do a film gesture, did not raise a finger like a prophet; he just pressed his palm to the back of her head once, very briefly, like he had known her since she was shorter than a hurdle, and he said, \u201cLain kali,\u201d and it was not disappointment, it was appetite.\n\nThe night was a different animal entirely outside the stadium. The city steamed and flashed and forgot easily and was proud of that. In the hotel room, the girls made a mess they would clean later and shared food that tasted better because it had been paid for by someone else\u2019s money, a plum sweetness of victory without triumph. They watched replay clips that had already started making their rounds, captioned and filtered and slowed, and they made their own commentary, mean and kind in equal parts, and they were everything a team is that doesn\u2019t need to hold hands to hold a line. Dara sent Rafi a picture of her shoes with their salt maps like coastlines and he sent back a photo of his whiteboard where he had written \u201c15/15/16/16/16/16/16/16/16/17?\u201d and then drawn a smiley face with eyebrows the nurse had complimented, and under it he had written, \u201cnot a guess, an autobiography.\u201d She laughed out loud and then threw a towel at Vina for making a comment about celebrities, and then let herself fall quiet because quiet after a race is a feast.\n\nIn the morning, they had the kind of travel day that makes the body feel like an object moved by other people\u2019s schedules. The bus smelled like sweat remembered and the road insisted on being itself with a stubbornness that made conversation part stop-and-go. The coach slept with his mouth open and an expression that would become myth if someone took a picture; they did not, because they all wanted to keep their coach human. Naya leaned her head on the window and drew a finger on the glass and left nothing. Vina made videos that would later look like more fun than they were, because that\u2019s how survival edits itself. Dara watched the green smear of trees and the scramble of vendors at a toll gate and the way the sky above the edge of the city seemed to be considering a new arrangement and thought of all the ways the day had been almost a trap and then wasn\u2019t.\n\nBack in Bandung, the stadium looked shy after Jakarta, but it was the kind of shyness that comes with kindness built in. The next week was already arranging itself: a little celebration disguised as a jog, the live thing the sponsor wanted that they pretended was about community and was actually about inventory, the repeated question from reporters who arrive late and ask if fear is like a muscle and if she has advice for young athletes, the hospital visits that braid themselves between training like a constant friend, the house where the couch kept its arguments and the kitchen kept its peace, the dog at the stadium with his adopted tape, the drain that sometimes decided to sing. The day after they returned, rain took the city by the shoulders and shook it, and Dara ran in it until her shirt clung in a way that did not deserve poetry, and she let her head be a metronome for her legs, and she felt the old picture try to come in through a corner and she told it, not cruelly, that it could watch if it wanted but it could not comment.\n\nThe live stream happened under a tent that wanted to be a set. The producer had assembled a small altar of props that said running without screaming it, and a young host with dimples asked questions like he had rehearsed empathy and passed. People in chat asked about warm-up and about breakfast and about shoes and about prayer and about playlists and one person asked, \u201cAre you really scared or is it just for brand,\u201d and the host made a face that said he wanted to skip it and the producer made a face that said he wanted to measure it, and Dara said, \u201cI\u2019m scared of many things, like everyone. I run anyway.\u201d Someone typed, \u201cLike Spider-Man,\u201d and a dozen laughing faces moved up the screen like bubbles, and Dara glanced at the corner of the tent where a web had drawn a straight line between two plastic poles and found herself smiling because sometimes the city gives you a gift sideways. She did not make a joke she could have made. She let the smile be private. After the stream, a small girl in a faded school shirt came up with a pen that didn\u2019t work and eyes that did, and said, \u201cMbak, if you are scared why do you do it,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cBecause I love it more than I am scared of it,\u201d and the girl nodded as if love were a recipe and her mother said terima kasih in a voice like a blanket.\n\nRafi had a small fever the day after, the kind that makes a room smaller and numbers less polite. He slept like a person who had assigned someone else his jokes for a night, and their mother counted while pretending not to count and made tea for no reason but the teapot needed to practice, and Dara sat in the chair that had become her shape and read the same sentence four times and did not make herself feel stupid for it. A nurse new to their part of the ward came in with sharp competence and a wrist that wore three hair ties and two bracelets and a watch trying to mind all its hours, and she said the fever would go because the meds would remember what to do and because he was young and young has a way of arguing with heat, and she updated the chart like a drawing. Dara watched a tiny mite that was not a spider stroll along the edge of the bedrail and she did not give it a story; she flicked it away because it was in the wrong place and thought about how it is possible to be gentle and efficient with an enemy.\n\nAt practice, Bu Rara returned like a rumor that had decided to become a person and walked them through a simple piece of mind work that felt like a trick until it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let a thought be a car on a road,\u201d she said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to watch it drive by without trying to stop it or get in,\u201d and Vina snorted and said hers were motorbikes that do not stay in lanes and Naya said hers were angkot that stop whenever they like, and they all made fun of themselves until their laughter tired, and then they stood in the drizzle and watched their brains make embarrassing choices and refused to be embarrassed. Dara felt an old picture pull up to the curb, a small eight-legged taxi that had been honking outside for years, and she did not get in; she watched it idling and then turn a corner it always turns when ignored. The coach observed from a few meters away with the expression of a man watching modern dance and trying to decide whether it was a joke, and then he said, \u201cKalau bisa bantu, ya sudah,\u201d and pulled out his stopwatch to do the thing he knows.\n\nA local journalist came with hair like a thesis and asked if the city had been kind to her, and she said the city had been itself and that was nearly always enough, and the journalist asked about Jakarta and the sound there and the way the last ten meters feel and whether the body tells the truth, and Dara said the body sometimes lies to protect you and sometimes lies to hurt you, and your job is to catch it in the act and forgive it anyway. The piece came out the next day with a picture of her that looked like she knew her lines and the headline stole the line about weather because headlines are magpies. Vina teased her for an hour and then sent her a screenshot where a comment said, \u201cMy daughter wants to run now,\u201d and it stopped being a game for a second and became a reason.\n\nWeeks spiraled with a discipline the calendar writes when a person has decided on a part of themselves to grow. She kept the counting that had started to feel less like compulsion and more like accompaniment. She kept stepping into shoes without ceremony. She kept saying the word that had once made her skin buzz and now sometimes did nothing but measure a breath. She still jumped sometimes at a dark curl in a corner, but she did not give it all her blood. Rafi\u2019s numbers went up and down like a coastline drawn by someone who had not yet been to geography class, and he pretended to be unfazed more times than he was, and they both refused to let bravery be a law. The sponsor continued to find angles and occasionally found grace. The coach continued to be a rock with a watch and occasionally let a joke happen in front of his own mouth, which meant a lot to the ones who were paying attention. Naya qualified for something small and important and celebrated it by eating noodles with too much chili and calling it strategy. Vina posted a video of her false start that she framed as a metaphor and a warning and a comedy, and the city applauded because the city is good at applause.\n\nThe day came when Dara ran a set in practice and did not think about correction or weight or fear for three entire minutes, and it felt like flying because flying is not the absence of gravity but the agreement with it, and she thought, after, sitting on the grass with tape around her finger like a ring, that this could be a life: the lanes, the visits, the small bread things her mother puts in plastic boxes, the sponsor who will eventually find a new story, the coach who will eventually choose a new kid to bark at, the spider she will see one day in a bathroom mirror and not flinch at, the brother who will be in a room that is not this one and will say something that saves her for the afternoon. She thought of the hurdle she hit and the bruise that had bloomed and the word she learned to say without summoning and the rhythm that lives at calf and shin and hinge, and she let herself want the next race without apology.\n\nWhen the sun decided to go down that evening it did it like a good exit, quickly, a bow and a soft step. The neighborhood filled with the kind of music you don\u2019t plan and the kind of cooking you don\u2019t measure, and she sat on her bed and wrote nothing and read nothing and closed her eyes and saw the ten bars in a row like teeth and did not feel afraid. She messaged Rafi a picture of the dog with the tape and he wrote, \u201cHe knows how to run with his fear,\u201d and she wrote, \u201cHe knows how to chew it,\u201d and he wrote, \u201cSame,\u201d and even the machine in his room made a sound that could be interpreted as a laugh if you wanted to be generous. She was generous. She lay back. The ceiling stayed stubbornly itself. The night belonged to anyone who could hold it for a second, and for once, and then again, she could.The first morning after Jakarta that felt like a morning again arrived with a light that had decided to be kind. The hills above Dago sent down a breeze that had learned to speak to sweat politely, and the stadium, smaller than the one that had held her in its mouth last week, looked relieved to be only itself. Pak Bram called hills because sometimes you have to ask the legs to argue with gravity in a different dialect, and they went out the back gate in twos and threes to the steep little road that curled like a question behind the university. The asphalt there was patched with tar that had cooled in shiny kidney shapes, and the angkot brakes barked like small mean dogs as they inched their way down, and the vendors were only just arranging their sopi-sopi, those temporary tables that hold breakfast like it is a fragile porcelain.\n\nShe ran the repeats with the efficiency of someone who wanted this to be done and wanted it to do something to her. Hills do not give you glamour, but they carve a kind of nobility into your calves if you let them. Naya matched her for the first four and then fell back with a grin that said she was doing math in a way that would pay her body interest later. Vina turned each ascent into a performance, knees higher, arms theatrical, talking between sets to an imaginary camera because the real one would arrive this afternoon and she liked to keep her dialogue warm. On the last rep, midway up where the slope kicked like a mule with timing, Dara felt her breath clutch and tried not to make a bargain with it. She let the step be just a step. She kept her hips forward. She let the road rise and she met it.\n\nBack at the field, a small tent with a logo had sprouted near the bleachers, the sponsor\u2019s colony marking. A man with shoes that did not trust the ground sipped coffee from a paper cup and looked at them like a farmer appraising a crop. The producer from the warehouse smiled with continuity, as if this morning were still part of that script. She waved at Dara, a wave that said welcome and also said we have chores. They waited until the last of the cool-down jog had sobered the team, and then the producer clapped her hands as if birds might land. \u201cWe loved last week,\u201d she said, efficient brightness in each syllable. \u201cThe comments were so engaged. The brand feels there is an opportunity to speak to youth about resilience. We\u2019re proposing\u2014\u201d she gestured, and the man in the formal shoes swiped to a new image on his tablet, an athlete mid-air, bars stylized into geometric shapes like art had met athletics and they had agreed to sit near each other.\n\nThe next slide was a sketch she did not like. A net, thin and elegant, stretched behind an athlete, and the tagline in English, because English implied sophistication to someone in an office: Run Through What Catches You. A smaller line beneath, in Bahasa, playful: Tembus Takut. The sketch was good, actually, clean lines and the white space used with taste. The problem was the deliciousness with which the idea treated her nerves.\n\n\u201cNo nets,\u201d Dara said, not unkindly. She kept her tone like a lane: blunt and marked.\n\nThe producer\u2019s brightness didn\u2019t dim, it re-angled. \u201cOf course, we hear you. The concept is metaphorical.\u201d\n\n\u201cMetaphors have bodies,\u201d Dara said. She felt her skin collect, a tightness under the clavicle that she knew how to measure now. \u201cWe can talk resilience. Not the web. Not the net.\u201d\n\nThe man with the shoes cleared his throat into a smile. \u201cWe can revise visuals. Core message is powerful.\u201d\n\nPak Bram watched the exchange with the expression of a man who had decided to let his runner test her start alone. He lifted one eyebrow in a way that said choose your fights and nodded when she did. Naya stepped closer, a quiet flanking move. \u201cMaybe rhythm,\u201d she said into the gentle space. \u201cStability. Keep step,\u201d and the producer, who liked a good pivot when it arrived dressed, brightened genuinely.\n\n\u201cYes! Rhythm. Count. We can do something with meter, heartbeat, your step count,\u201d she said, fingers dancing a new shape in the air. \u201cLess scary. More\u2026 method.\u201d She made the word sound like a couture label.\n\nThey let the new idea live long enough to grow a sketch right there, the tablet filling with lines and arrows, and the man\u2019s shoe finally trusting the ground enough to scuff a little. The producer glanced at Dara and did a small bow with her head that acknowledged both a battlefield avoided and a path chosen. Bad compromises rot, good ones can feed you.\n\nAt the hospital later, the air in the ward had that particular calm that announces the hour when even machines try to lower their voices. Rafi was propped with a magazine he had no intention of reading and a bandage that made his arm look like a prop from a play. The fever had receded as predicted, leaving fatigue like a tide line. He smiled when she walked in with a container of kue lapis, the colors stacked like optimism.\n\n\u201cMy athlete,\u201d he said in a voice that had borrowed sandpaper but was still his.\n\n\u201cMy patient,\u201d she said, placing the sweets where food would decide their schedule, not them. \u201cThey want to wrap me in metaphors.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease tell me you said you would only wear similes,\u201d he said, and then winced because the laugh he wanted would cost him. She sat and told him about the pitch and the net and the pivot to rhythm, and he nodded, pleased like an old coach who approved of a training macrocycle he wouldn\u2019t have designed himself. \u201cThere\u2019s music in it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople like seeing you count what they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe looked at his hand, at the finger where a nail had fallen off and was growing back stubborn and ugly the way healing sometimes is, and she thought about counting that was not steps. \u201cYou want garden?\u201d she asked after a beat. He had gotten three days of good numbers in a row. Sometimes you ask for the treat only when you are almost sure you will not be refused.\n\nHe wanted garden. The nurse with the three hair ties and the watch that worked hard signed them out like passengers on a short ferry and warned them about wind because wind on a roof is a different animal from wind on a street. The garden had learned them by now; it arranged its light so the bench they liked was not wet, it held the jasmine\u2019s smell back a little because it was new and could be rude, it presented a spider web without its owner strung between a low branch and a railing like lace that had chosen sobriety. Rafi tipped his head to it like to an elder. Dara watched the way the dew had beaded along the threads, each drop with its own idea of gravity. She did not step around it more than she needed. She did not report the sighting to any alarm inside. They sat and talked about what noodles to eat in two weeks if the numbers behaved a bit longer, and they talked about the boy in the next bed who had a voice like a radio and told stories into the night, and they talked about whether the city had more green left in it than people said, and they let the wind be the third voice in their conversation.\n\nTraining changed shape the way a song slows when you reach the bridge. The speed remained but the emphasis moved. They worked drills that had the brain listening for rhythm even when breath tried to distract it. Bu Rara had them mark out strides with chalk on the track, faded dots that their feet learned like a child's string game. Dara found that when she was watching for her count she had less space for other pictures and felt a fury at the simplicity that made her say, later, to Naya, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me to look at the dots earlier,\u201d and Naya said, \u201cThey did, in different ways. You needed it to look like chalk.\u201d Vina mocked the dots until she stumbled her own count and then she fell in love with them in a day and put \u201cdots are my guide\u201d on a story that would make it to someone\u2019s for you page who needed it.\n\nIn the locker room one Thursday, there was an actual creature again. This time it wasn\u2019t a jump-scare thrown by fate. It was small, brown, not a myth, near the drain under the bench. The younger girls squealed because they were allowed to and then moved back too far because they thought they weren\u2019t. Dara felt the old elevator drop in her chest, the hitch that used to spoil entire mornings. She stood there, the bag half open, the towel already smelling like a thousand showers, and watched the animal move, quick and certain in its own axis. She heard herself breathe. She did not look for anybody to rescue her from a thing she hated. She took the plastic container that held her hair ties, emptied three elastics into her pocket, and squatted the way her coach hated because he said that posture had a way of making knees into arguments. She slid the container slowly until it was a room over the spider. She felt the thread of disgust hum along her forearms like a warning wire. She held steady, slid the lid with awkward kindness and felt it click. Her heart allowed itself one ridiculous flourish and then retook its seat. The girls watched like she had performed a trick; Vina had been in the doorway and clapped once, impertinent and approving. Dara carried the container outside and tipped it into the grass with a motion that betrayed the tiny tremor she still had, and the spider, unafraid of her as it had always been, decided its own direction and went. She walked back in and forced herself not to pant like a hero.\n\nLater, in the set, her body answered her with a steadiness that felt like interest paid on a long debt. Count, lift, place, cut the air where it wants to hold you. She stumbled once at five because habits do not go to the grave without a fight, and she smiled into the mistake like a person who finally recognizes their mischievous cousin.\n\nThe sponsor came back with the rhythm concept solid enough to touch. They had lines cut into vinyl that they laid on the track for a staged shoot after practice on a Sunday when the sky had decided to bless the city with a bright that did not sting. The lines looked like music made into a path, white ticks a cadence. They asked her to run and then to walk and then to stop and talk, the camera close enough that she could count the pores of the lens itself. \u201cTell us what you hear when you run,\u201d the host asked with those dimples bestowing comfort, and she said the names of small sounds she had never bothered to name before: the whisper of a sock sliding up the back of a heel where the tape ends, the click when spike meets bar by accident, the way breath fills the space inside a mask you pretend isn\u2019t there on polluted days, the way Naya\u2019s laugh sounded like a permission that had finally been granted, the way the coach\u2019s whistle could be a prayer or a curse depending on how it entered your chest. The comments later would call it poetry; to her it was inventory.\n\nAt home, her stepfather had tools out on the floor like an altar to metal. He had taken apart a small fan and was cleaning out the dust that had the color of many months piled. He nodded at her, and she nodded back because in their new language nods were paragraphs. \u201cI made something,\u201d he said finally, in a way that suggested he would accept mild mockery as a tax. He led her outside to the small yard crowded with pots that had slid from her mother\u2019s ambition to grow greens to a pragmatic acceptance of what would live; he had welded two old bicycle frames and a length of pipe into a makeshift hurdle, the top bar fashioned from a smooth slat of wood he had planed himself. It was heavier than regulation, and ugly in a way that made it handsome. \u201cFor latihan di rumah,\u201d he said, like he had purchased a small satellite and parked it near the potted chili.\n\nShe laughed with her whole face and with a soft ache in the throat. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 perfect,\u201d she said, and meant it. He looked relieved in a way she had never seen, as if he had been holding a plank with his teeth and could set it down. He said he had watched a video of her doing drills and had decided he could make a thing she could argue with at home. \u201cYou stand here,\u201d he demonstrated badly, knees creaking, and she loved him a little worse for pretending his body had forgotten the flood. He looked at the drain near the back step and then away and then back. \u201cI closed this,\u201d he said, as if anticipating a rebuke that did not come. \u201cOnly when hujan besar.\u201d She said okay because it was okay.\n\nThe gotong royong spirit, that village muscle city life tries to forget, pulled its weight the following week when storm water laughed at the stadium\u2019s drains. The far corner turned into a mirror, and the frog came back with cousins. The coach threw his hands in the air and then used them to set cones in the gym. They did plyometrics inside where the shouting of boys playing futsal next door made everything feel like a market. Her stepfather appeared at the edge of the field wearing his work shirt and a stubbornness, carrying a snake of coiled hose and a length of rebar like he had made a date with the concept of flow. He and two other men who had been boys here once and then went away and then came back got into the drain with the easy heroism of people who do not ask to be photographed while shoulder-deep in the old city\u2019s secrets. He looked up once at Dara, face shining with rain and effort, and did that nod they had taught themselves. She did the nod back that contained gratitude without a speech.\n\nWhen the water receded with a sulk, they went back out and ran curved runs on lanes five and six to avoid the silt smear on the inside. Naya made a joke about a new event, 380 meters with mud hazard, and Vina pretended to slip for the camera and then slipped for real and fell on her pride more than her ass and laughed because she would rather be known for laughing than for sulking. Dara felt the familiar urge to scan the edges of the lane and practiced the thing Bu Rara had given them: she allowed the scan and then let it be a car on the road, going by, not stopping. She counted. She let the drumbeat be a drumbeat, not a warning. She let herself run until the part of her that had wanted to be dramatic lay down and took a nap.\n\nNational Trials announced themselves in an email that wore a logo and expectation. The field would be deeper, the time standards printed in black like a dare. Jakarta would be hotter, the noise larger, the consequences more expensive. The sponsor sent a careful message asking if they could shoot something in the week before, \u201cpre-race rituals, simple moments,\u201d and the producer promised no props, no nets, no cleverness, just a lens catching hands tying laces and faces deciding. Dara agreed because sometimes saying yes to small things keeps bigger wolves from the door. The brand\u2019s assistant sent a list of questions that included one about fear she left unanswered, and the assistant, a woman who knew how to read silence and did it kindly, did not push.\n\nRafi had a good week and then a bad afternoon and then a regular day. The hospital had learned to make rollercoasters look like sidewalks. He clowned at a new intern and hit on a volunteer with a nerve that was polite and commented on how her eyeliner was a work of engineering, and then he winced at a pain spiking where sap doesn\u2019t run and swallowed it without being noble. He asked her to bring noodles and then decided the smell made him want to set the world on fire, and she laughed because these were preferences and preferences meant he was not in the part of the story where everything is just endurance. She brought him a small plastic spider from a kid\u2019s toy shop, black and shiny and stupid, and he put it on his IV pole and announced it his mascot, and the nurses groaned and named it Ujang and assigned it a bed number as a joke. He made her take a picture of Ujang supervising his infusion and posted it on a private account with five friends and three cousins, and one of the cousins who used to be a terror wrote, \u201cRespect Ujang,\u201d and it was a silly thing that managed to make the room lighter.\n\nIn the one quiet evening before travel, she went to the small mosque at the end of the alley because the call had sounded like a friend. She did not know what to ask beyond the usual and a new thing that had no name. She found she did not need to ask, only to stand and bow and stand again and make her breath obey a pace that had nothing to do with meter marks and everything to do with living through a day. Back home, her mother was already boiling water to fill a thermos for the next morning because mothers prefer to have already taken care of a future before it arrives and disappoints them. The note on the fried rice this time said simply: for after, and had a small heart drawn as if her mother felt embarrassed by art. Her stepfather oiled the hinge of the bedroom door that had squealed for three months because he had finally heard it enough times to decide it had been insulting him personally. They were a house that learned slowly and then forever.\n\nThe bus to Jakarta looked the same and did not feel the same. The team had shed the soft weight of hesitation and replaced it with a different restlessness. Naya brought a book of poems and really read it instead of using it as a prop. Vina slept under a hoodie with her mouth open by choice and an earphone in only one ear because attention is a currency she does not completely give to anyone. The coach watched the road with the concentration of a driver and the surrender of cargo. Dara watched the fields and the water that lay between them like sheets a child had left in a yard, and she thought absurdly of spider silk and dew, of the strength of something so small and how angering it is to feel admiration and disgust for the same engineering. She thought of the first time she had counted a full set and the way her heart had thanked her. She put her hand flat to the window again, the old gesture now just a habit without magic, and she said the sentence she had invented for herself, not out loud, not a spell, just a pact: you can ride, you cannot drive.\n\nAt the warm-up track, the air smelled like it had been holding its breath since the last big meet and was trying to catch up. The call room did its holy hush act. She went through drills with a calm that surprised her because she had expected to perform her calm and found she had some in stock. The coach said nothing unusual and thus blessed her. The lane number was different this time; the heat draw likes to remind athletes that nothing belongs to them. She pinned the bib with only two stabs to the finger. The volunteer smiled with a kindness that could only have been taught by a grandmother. Everything wanted to be an omen and she let nothing be.\n\nThe gun made the sound it makes when you agree to live inside it for a minute. She took the four, took the one, felt three ask for a story and refused, decided early on five to keep the fifteen longer than she had in training because the air had decided not to argue today, and then did the switch where it belonged with less drama than last time. The bar at seven was the bar at seven; she did not make it into her childhood. Eight was where her shoulder knocked with its old rhythm and she held it without scolding. Nine tried to turn itself into a cliff and she made it a curb. Ten was the truth she knew how to tell and she told it. The line took her under its lip and then she was through, and the number told her she had been exact enough to be dangerous to herself.\n\nShe won her heat without being the fastest person in the stadium, which is a magic that happens only when you don't demand it. The clock kissed her with a number that would make a coach\u2019s mouth tighten in pleasure. In the final, the day made her run harder than she had run in practice and exactly as hard as she had known she would need to and a hair harder anyway. She did not win the event. The winner had a kick like a lie you want to believe. She came second again, this time with a time that did not apologize for existing. The noise held her as if it had been paid and she had given a good receipt. It was not a miracle; she does not believe in those. It was something else: a day she had earned.\n\nBack at the hotel, her legs ached in coherent sentences. She lay on the carpet and let them talk. Vina spun in the desk chair and filmed them all without warning and posted without malice. Naya applied ice with the malice of a medic and refused to let anyone be dramatic about it. The coach looked like a man who had finally let his shoulders drop in a room where no one would photograph him doing it. The sponsor\u2019s assistant brought fruit plates that had been arranged by someone with a certificate and apologized for the lack of mangosteen as if it were her fault and then took a call from her boss and spoke about \u201cauthenticity\u201d without flinching. The producer gave Dara a look from across the room that said thank you for protecting your line. They were all in a life together that did not ask them to declare exactly how much they cared.\n\nOn the way back to Bandung, the air over the road had that post-rain gleam that makes everything look like it has been washed and then put back crooked. The bus had a rattle near the door that they had all agreed not to hear. Dara dozed and woke and dozed and woke, and in the second waking she looked up to find that the seat across the aisle held a small actual spider, one leg missing, making a ridiculous journey on the upholstery. It was tiny enough to be forgiven by anyone who was not her, and she watched it and felt the tug and the slide, the old metal in the mouth followed by the new breath that paid it down. She did not panic. She did not call for a killing. She did not name it. She watched it reach the seam, decide, and turn the long way around, sensible for once, and she thought, I am not required to make this a lesson, and she closed her eyes because sleep is a tool she had refused for too long and now she would use it.\n\nWhen she got to the stadium the next morning\u2014because you go to the stadium after everything, that is the law of this particular religion\u2014the dog was there with his tape, ruined now, just a ribbon, and he had decided it no longer needed parenting and had left it under the bleachers after all that labor. She picked up the tape and tied it to the fence where the breeze could play with it without turning it into trash, and she ran her warm-up in a way that made the past a companion that knew when to shut up. The brain had lied, the body had learned, and both of them, for once, inclined their heads to the day and let it be ordinary, and that, she thought as her foot found its place in the rhythm of a hundred small decisions, was a victory that might outlast medals.The next week arranged itself into a pattern that looked like a life instead of an accident. Monday belonged to starts and the annoying honesty of film; you think you are lifting, you see on a screen that your hips have opinions. Tuesday went to strength the way a day belongs to a saw: up, down, clean lines if you respect the wood. Wednesday gave them hills again until calves felt carved. Thursday was the day Pak Bram had decided they would clean, which meant he arrived with a broom instead of a speech and told them to be athletes who deserved a place that wasn\u2019t tired of them. The younger boys groaned like he had asked them to donate a kidney; the girls made it into gossip. They dragged a shallow bin along the inside of the bleachers and found the city\u2019s confessions: empty cups, a sock without a sibling, a half-dead fan, a photograph of a face smiling at someone who had removed themselves from the picture. Near the corner where the drain liked to complain, a web held a dust\u2019s version of harvest, grey and polite and empty. Dara looked and did not translate it into a threat. She was bored by her own old habit for a second, and the boredom lightened her limbs like a practical prayer.\n\nUnder the third step of the south bleacher, where the stadium stored decades of elbow grease, someone found a cluster of egg sacs, pearls if pearls could also be nightmares. The discovery made the volume of the morning jump; one of the boys lifted his phone and filmed a groan, Vina leaned in then leaned back with the drama she earns, and a cleaner who had been here longer than their coach said calmly that this was every rainy season, with a wide shrug that could hold ten tiny kingdoms and still have space. Dara felt the orchestra in her chest tune up, the old instruments finding notes without being asked. She said the word in her mouth the way she would say \u201csixteen\u201d before a switch. She took off her training jacket, laid it on the concrete to make a line between the world and her knees, and slid a tray under the step like she had learned to slide lids. The cleaner looked at her with the measured approval older women allot like gold coins. They lifted the step with three hands, slid the sacs into the tray with a paint scraper as gentle as guilt, and carried them to the far end past the fence where the grass was too brave and the lizards made their empires and let the tray be a raft. Someone made a joke about mothers. Someone else made a joke about omens. Dara\u2019s hands shook afterward in that small internal way that leaves no evidence on the surface, and her breathing was ragged, but she was standing, and the ground was just ground. She took the broom again and went back to persuading dust to forgive them for months of stomping.\n\nThe sponsor\u2019s tent that had sprouted near the bleachers felt less like a colony that day and more like a neighbor who had brought sugar and gossip. They had asked her to visit a school that sat two streets over and one generation under, and she said yes because the street was their street and she had run past that fence enough times to owe it something. The producer balanced a cake box on her palm and made jokes about bribing attention, and the man who liked his shoes clean tried to adopt a slouch for the alley that did not fit him at all.\n\nThe school had the smell that all schools share and no one has managed to bottle: warm paper, ink, resolved arguments, rubber soles, the faint stubbornness of chalk. The badminton court in the yard had surrendered lines to bare feet long ago. They put her on a chair in front and the principal made a speech with three jokes the students had obviously heard before, laughing in the right places like a choir executing a well-practiced harmony. Dara told them about the lane and how it was a friend if you let it be boring, she told them about the hurdle and how it stopped being a wall when you taught your body the steps like a nursery rhyme, and she told them a little about fear without saying fear, because she was not there to make drama a subject. She showed them how to count fifteen with the body. A boy in the third row asked if running made her rich in a tone that contained no malice, only economics. She said running made her tired and then satisfied and sometimes gave her bus tickets; wealth was a thing she would not pretend to explain until someone paid her to do it.\n\nAfter the questions, when pictures had been taken in groups that made no sense and every phone had captured a version of her eyes looking somewhere else, a small boy tugged her sleeve and said he had something to show her and could he show her outside where it was brighter. He had a jar with holes poked in the lid and a creature inside that had decided it would look best if it did not move. The boy said his name was Ari with the self-importance of a person who had named himself a thousand times in games. He tipped the jar like it contained a treasure and not a trigger. It was a jumper, small, black, with a ridiculous arrogance that only something that size can afford, its front legs held like knives, its body a tight punctuation. The jar smelled like leaves and boy hands.\n\nDara felt the old elevator drop again and then stop halfway between floors because control had remembered its job. She crouched until she was at Ari\u2019s face, and in the crouch she felt the echo of a coach\u2019s scold and ignored it. She asked Ari if he had caught it in the classroom, because that would have been a story; he said on the fence, and he said it ate mosquitoes and it was his pet until recess ended. He said, with the solemnity of children who\u2019ve read a thing and now own it, that spiders are not insects, and she smiled because pedantry in the right hand can be a balloon. The producer pretended to look away and actually looked because this kind of thing is gold with marketing glaze. Dara looked at the jar and did not look away, not even once, and she felt the buzzing at the back of her mouth settle, not into comfort, but into an argument that did not require shouting. She told Ari that he was not wrong, that the tiny hunter was doing a job inside the world she had not asked to be born into, and then she asked him if he could return it to work. They walked to the hedge by the wall and unscrewed the lid together and tipped the jar and the little animal did not jump onto her, did not attack, did not reenact her story; it went onto the leaf, because the leaf was the right thing. The boy went back to class carrying nothing and feeling bigger. The producer, to her credit, did not dangle the moment in front of a lens. The brand\u2019s assistant handed Ari a sticker like a medal and made no speech. Sometimes people know how to behave.\n\nThe day dropped its middle on the ward with the abruptness it reserves for hospitals. Rafi had woken with a number that took the floor out of their mother\u2019s knees, and he had spent the morning wearing a stubborn heat that blushed his cheeks like a slap. The nurses flowed around him with competence that could calm a train, and the doctor used a voice he saves for days when he cannot fix anything immediately but can still fix his tone. Sepsis is an ugly word that pretends to be Latin for drama. It is just a door you do not want to walk through. They flooded him through a line that had learned his vein\u2019s name by now, and their mother counted the drops without looking like she was doing arithmetic, and the ward hushed the way wards hush when there is emergency but not panic. Dara sat on the chair that had accepted her shape and texted the coach that she would not be at the second session, not later and not in an hour and not if she ran from here to the track in slippers. She did not add apology. She did not add explanation beyond the obvious. You have to let people fill in their own blanks sometimes.\n\nHe replied with a thumb that could be read three ways and a sentence that had the humility he uses like a muscle. He said to stay where she was; he said they would run again tomorrow; he said the wind would still be there. She put the phone away because the room needed fewer screens. Rafi burned and then wavered and then came back down as if recovery were a polite descent. He coughed once and apologized for the volume like a man pulling his weight at his own funeral and she smacked his arm lightly because he didn\u2019t get to joke about that part. In the late afternoon, when the ward had decided it could do regular life again, the coach appeared at the door with that expression he gives when he has something in his hand that embarrasses him. It was a bottle of isotonic drink and a bag of sliced fruit that had been wrapped in plastic so tight it looked like it had been vacuum-sealed for space. He placed it on the bedside cabinet as if crossing a finish line and looked everywhere except at Rafi\u2019s tubes. He told Rafi to get better like it was a drill and told him his sister was irritating when she didn\u2019t have anyone to outrun. Rafi thanked him like a man being introduced to a neighbor\u2019s dog for the second time.\n\nAn hour later, in the corridor, the coach confessed, in the dry way he has when a sentence costs him what he thinks is pride and is actually just an old habit, that he had once watched a teammate have a seizure on the infield, the way a body insists on its own electricity and everyone else looks at the sky because they want to ask for a refund. \u201cSince then,\u201d he said, scratching the back of his neck with a thumb as if the words had come out the wrong door, \u201cI don\u2019t like any of you doing drama on the ground. Keep it standing. If fall, fall in line. You understand.\u201d He looked like he had admitted to owning a small, foolish pet that he also loved. She said she understood without making it bigger than it was. Behind him, down the corridor, her stepfather appeared with a plastic bag that had been bought to replace the previous plastic bag and held the same food because routine is medicine you can afford. The two men nodded to each other with that wary respect men reserve for one another when they cannot measure who is more necessary to the girl between them. The coach left with his watch set to comfort. Her stepfather took his place in the chair and made a joke about Ujang, the mascot spider, asking for visitation rights.\n\nThe call about camp arrived while she and Naya were tying the elastic bands that make a person\u2019s hips honest. National training would be held at Ragunan for six weeks. There would be two coaches who had not learned their names yet, a physio who would, and an official who would count everything and then count it again as if this time numbers might decide to be kinder. The group chat lit with blistering optimism, then settled into logistics like a cooking show: who would water the plant in Vina\u2019s room that she insists is a basil and is actually a pothos, who could feed the lanky cat that lived behind the long jump sand and had had kittens on their day off, who could be trusted to tell the sponsor that no, they would not do a live from weights. Dara read the message twice and kept her face smooth. Rafi stuck a thumb up from his pillow that carried a cannula. He said go before she asked. He said if she did not, he would make her tie him to his IV pole and drag him to training, which would be embarrassing for everyone because he would be the slowest thing on the track. She did a bad bow from the waist while sitting and he laughed with his eyes and then with his chest when it stopped hurting.\n\nThat night, at home, her mother folded clothes that had nothing to do with training with a care that would put a laundry detergent advertisement to shame. She put socks together that had long ago chosen to divorce and, through sheer maternal stubbornness, forced a reconciliation. She wrote a note on a piece of paper that had been used for a list of prices on one side and a prayer on the other and tucked it into the side of the bag where the tape lives. Dara would not see the note until the fourth day in camp, when she would need it. Her stepfather stood in the door with his arms crossed because he had nothing to do with packing except wanting and not knowing where to put it. He said he\u2019d go to the hospital on Wednesdays and Saturdays when she couldn\u2019t, and he said it in a voice that pretended it was a suggestion and wasn\u2019t. She said thank you and meant it in a way that wrapped old and new recognition around his name. Later, he tested the hinge he had oiled and smiled at it as if it had thanked him.\n\nThe national dorms had beds that pretended to be stern and rooms that smelled like fifteen years of dreams and anti-mold packets. The communal bathrooms had tiles that had been chosen by someone who resented color. Her roommate was a hurdler from Manado named Lia who wore her hair in a bun that made her look like she never left business to accident. Lia had a way of speaking that made bad news sound like an invitation to dance and good news sound like an assignment. On the first night, Lia took her to the bathroom on their floor like she was introducing a new friend to an old friend and said if the water is cold, hit it, and if the light flickers, talk to it. On the second morning, around five, the flicker was the least of it. There was a spider the size of an old coin on the shower wall, tuley brown, slow, deliberate, obviously not interested in girls with soap. Lia said \u201chai\u201d to it like you say to an aunt you haven\u2019t decided to love yet. Dara felt the usual involuntary poem start in her chest and then interrupt itself. She took the plastic bowl they used to pour water on their heads and pressed it to the tile with a care that surprised her and slid it down until bowl met floor. \u201cYou okay?\u201d Lia asked, half ready with a giggle, half with genuine care. Dara breathed two times and took the flat, cheap sandal she hated and slid it under the bowl as a lid, then took the whole construction outside to the corridor and tipped. The spider made a decision and took the corner toward the stairs. Lia made a sound that was ninety percent delight and ten percent \u201cew.\u201d Later, in the dining hall, she told three girls at breakfast that her roommate was ridiculous and brave and Dara did not correct the order.\n\nThe camp introduced her to Sari with the formal informality of athletes who have already met across lanes. Sari had been the woman from Semarang leaning into the finish like a thesis. Up close, she was someone you would trust to hold your wallet and beat you to the last seat on the bus; these things, in a good person, coexist. They ran side by side as if the track had been waiting for the two of them to pack each other\u2019s lunches. They sorted out their rivalry without words, in the way strides stretch, in the way breaths match and then diverge. Sari asked in the gym if it was true about fear and a sponsor and a net, and Dara rolled her eyes and said a brand tried to embroider her nerves and she had told them to bring thread for her calves instead. Sari grinned like approval is a sport. They shared a physio who had hands like a clockmaker and a habit of humming 90s love songs while scraping out the nonsense that lives in a hamstring. They avoided the national official who had decided it was his job to teach them how to smile like medals. They learned the cafeteria\u2019s bad days and the good seat where the AC did not aim at the back of your neck like a gossip.\n\nOn the third week, her phone vibrated with a message from her mother that held only the word \u201cbisa\u201d and then a list of times. She called the ward from under a shade tree that was trying to decide whether it was a therapeutic presence or a shelter for smokers. The doctor said \u201celigible\u201d like a word had been allowed to put its shoes on. A donor match had been found for Rafi, not perfect, but a near enough sister to the blood that the body might be persuaded to accept it; there would be a window, logistics were commotion, the hospital would be a choreography of white coats and moving parts and permissions. Transplant was a word Dara had previously met only in late-night articles and other families\u2019 stories; now it stood in her living room.\n\nShe walked the perimeter of the little field behind the dorm where damp collects and small frogs try their luck. She counted for no reason except to remind herself that numbers could be domesticated; one breath, two, three, like chalk dots underfoot without the chalk. She told herself to stay until there was a reason to go. She called the coach, her coach, not the national one who barely knew her name and liked to say \u201cyou people\u201d as if that were efficient, and she told him the news, half expecting the sound of a whistle inside his throat. He said \u201cgood\u201d like he meant it, then he said \u201cgulp the training,\u201d and she understood he meant do not break your shape with worry. He said if a day arrives that needs you, the track will wait. She cried in a way that would be invisible to anyone who was not holding her face at the time. Then she wiped it with the back of her hand like a kid who has had practice.\n\nThere was a day when a rumor tried to take the lane. Someone online, with a username that sounded like a name and a face that refused to be a face, wrote that fear was a marketing tool and that she had made spiders into a product to sell shoes. It would have made her eyes hot a month ago. As it was, she threw her phone toward the bed and missed and retrieved it and then sent the link to Vina with the note \u201cCome collect your people.\u201d Vina screenshotted the ridiculousness and posted it with a caption that made a joke out of how little content creators needed to eat, and then she called, which surprised Dara because this is not usually what Vina does. She said, in a voice that had put its lipstick away, that people on the internet are a fog and you do not make turns based on fog. She said also, awkward like a shoe on the wrong foot, that she had been jealous of the attention and had said one and a half mean things that were hers and not the fog\u2019s, and she apologized by calling herself a clown twice, which was her version of kneeling. Dara accepted, heartily, and then made fun of her for not knowing what pothos is. They were silly on the phone for long enough that the rumor was forced to look for a new shape to sit in.\n\nThe national coach, a man with a jaw like a stapler, ran them on the grass in diagonals and made them run again when the diagonals were not straight enough for his eyes. He used words like \u201cmovement quality\u201d and \u201cinhibition,\u201d and when someone groaned, he said he would inhibit their breakfast. They learned, in the way girls who run learn quicker than anyone thinks, that half of this game is keeping your head where you told it to be. In the dorm that night, Lia told Dara that there had been a tarantula in her aunt\u2019s house in Bitung as big as a hand and that her aunt had called it swear words and left it alone and it had left, and that bravery sometimes looks like not cleaning. Dara said she could get behind that definition. She went to brush her teeth and the bathroom was empty of drama and the mirror did not have any messages for her. She regarded her face with the curiosity of a stranger who might buy.\n\nOn the fourth day of the fourth week, the hospital asked for signatures on papers that had corners and read like small constitutions. Their mother wore her neatest clothes that were not neat and her neatest breath that was not steady, and their stepfather signed his name like someone who had taught his hand late and it still wanted to forget its letters. Rafi, who had shed much of his vanity with his hair, insisted that Ujang attend the consent conference taped to the side of the IV pole like a witness. Dara listened on video and said yes to the Yes parts and breathed through the parts that sounded like materials written to cover every hypothesis. The nurse with the three hair ties and the bracelets nodded at her through pixels like a friend telling you they would keep a seat for you at the stupid party in case you arrived late.\n\nThe night before the procedure, she sat with Naya on the low curb behind the track and they ate noodles from a packet that all runners pretend they do not eat and then confess to loving. They talked about lanes because that was safe, and then they talked about Rafi because life had asked, and Naya told a story about an aunt\u2019s operation that turned out to be less dramatic than the story had promised and how sometimes the world uses the language of catastrophe to describe a day that ends in a sandwich. Dara held the thought like a warm coin. The national coach passed them in the corridor later and said \u201clights out\u201d as if he could enforce the night, and they said \u201cyes, sir\u201d with the practiced insolence of girls who would sleeplessly count anyway.\n\nIn the morning, she ran before the sun committed, because the body knows how to pray in its own dialect. The warm-up track had a cat who had decided that the coil of a hose was its kingdom; she didn\u2019t disturb the monarchy. She did A-skips and B-skips and small hops that told her ankles the truth, and she counted fifteen with breath, not with steps, and she remembered to keep her arms quiet because noise radiates. She finished with two accelerations that made the air part in front of her as if it had a plan for her shape. Then she went back, showered, put on real clothes because hospitals notice when you arrive looking like you live there, and took the bus to the ward because she did not trust her legs not to take her to the track if she went on foot.\n\nThe ward had organized itself into a quiet that was not fake. The donor\u2019s blood, persuaded by a government database and good luck, had arrived cold and correct. Rafi joked twice without catching breath and had to stop, and then he did the serious thing people do before anesthesia by making insane faces, and then he went in. Their mother sat as if the chair was a talking thing and she was trying to hear the words. Their stepfather, who had never called any man \u201cdoctor\u201d in his life without feeling cheated, called four men in coats \u201cDoctor\u201d and meant it. Dara walked the corridor and did not think about corners. She texted the coach that she would be out of the group chat noise. He replied with an emoji that could be a fist or a potato depending on your generation. Hours do the strangest stretches in hospitals. You already know this if you\u2019ve ever watched lamplight change on tile and tried not to count because counting makes it worse.\n\nIt went. Of course it went; she would not tell this story like this from the other side if it did not. It was not miracle, again. It was science with a handshake from mercy. The doctor said what doctors say when things have done what they are supposed to do without making a scene: now we wait, now we watch, now we do not insult the body with too much celebration at the wrong time. When they rolled him out and parked him in his new reality, he looked like sleep held his weight for him. Their mother cried the kind of tears that clean you out and leave you stable; not salt, but water. The nurse with the bracelets winked at Dara like an accomplice and said \u201cgood\u201d in a tone that had known every version of \u201cbad.\u201d Ujang, foolishly taped to the pole, looked down on the proceedings with the comfort of a mascot whose work here was done and would begin again tomorrow.\n\nShe went to sleep that night back at the dorm as if she had earned the right to be unconscious. In the morning, the body insisted on its routine like a friend being gentle. Sari met her at the track and did not ask for news but kept pace easy and matched her breath so they could keep a conversation without adding words. Vina sent a video of herself saying something stupid to a camera about breakfast, and Dara laughed, and it wasn\u2019t a rebellion or a statement, it was a release valve. The national coach did not praise more because he did not know how; he barked less. Bu Rara sent a voice note that said nothing useful and somehow helped, a calm voice reminding her to count stones on a path instead of looking into bushes. Her stepfather messaged a photograph of the homemade hurdle with rain beads on it like small medals, and her mother sent a picture of a bowl of soup and wrote \u201cfor after\u201d because she wasn\u2019t going to retire a good note for one time.\n\nThe Trials were set to begin the week after the first markers of Rafi\u2019s acceptance would appear in numbers that had learned her name. The stadium in Jakarta would look no different to a new runner and entirely different to a girl who had carried a jar with a web once. She stood in the lane during the last practice before travel and watched the lines as if they might back away, then looked up because she had learned that sometimes the sky is as busy as the ground. A bird that had made the track its commute dropped a very small feather onto lane five, and it drifted with a carelessness she envied and then landed near the takeoff for three, and she did not make it significant. She counted. She ran. Then she ran again, and this time when the old tug under her shoulder arrived, she let it ride without paying it with a grimace it did not deserve. Naya shouted something unhelpful and loving. The coach\u2019s whistle cut a line in the morning and then softened. The city, that old person who watched from beyond the wall, said nothing because it did not need to. She had enough voices in her chest now that made sense.\n\nThat evening, she packed with the efficiency of a person who had repeated a life until it obeyed. She placed the tape where it belongs, the sachet in the pocket her hand knows even in the dark, the spikes wrapped in a shirt that did not deserve to smell like them. She took the note her mother had tucked and finally read it: a list of small instructions that had nothing to do with running and everything to do with being a person: drink water but not too much before gun; call after; if you see a cat, do not kick it; if you see a big person, remember they were small once; if you see a small thing that scares you, remember it does not know you. She laughed and cried and then did neither. She turned off the light and lay in the dark and did not make it a metaphor. The morning would arrive with its own feet. She would meet it where she always did: lane, line, count, breath, a body that had learned, a brain that had decided to be less creative, a family that coursed through her in as invisible a way as blood, a fear that had gotten bored with being the main character and learned to play a supporting role. She slept, and her sleep made no promises beyond the polite ones. The city filled the rest.The week folded itself around departures as if travel were a person who had to be accommodated. In the dorm, Lia narrated the packing like a sportscaster because it calmed her nerves and entertained whoever walked by their door: tape in first because ankles have seniority, spikes wrapped in the shirt you hate because they will punish it with their smell, toiletries in a pouch that pretends order is possible for small bottles, the lucky hair tie even if you don\u2019t believe in luck. Dara let herself move slower than the clock demanded, not as a rebellion but because slowness is its own strategy when the head wants to sprint ahead and check every corner for a trap. Her phone lay face down on the bed like a guest who had fallen asleep on the sofa, and when she flipped it, the messages were a small street fair: the sponsor\u2019s assistant reminding her of a polite appearance after heats, the coach\u2019s \u201cingat makan,\u201d her mother\u2019s three shades of prayer disguised as instructions to wear socks at night so her calves wouldn\u2019t \u201cmasuk angin,\u201d and a video from the ward where Ujang had been ceremonially retired from the IV pole with a tiny paper \u201cterima kasih\u201d sign taped beside him. The nurse with the bracelets said, off-camera and with a wink that translated across pixels, that mascots need rest too, and Rafi, in a voice that had borrowed steadiness again, declared that Ujang had been promoted to head of risk management and would now live on top of the TV where dust goes to die.\n\nThe bus down to Jakarta carried the same smells and complaints and astonishments it always did, the rhythm of a body of people trying to arrange themselves into comfort on upholstery never designed for it. Sari sat across the aisle with her knees pulled up and her eyes closed, mouth pulled into a line that could be focus or fatigue, and Naya leaned into the window\u2019s light and turned a poem book face down on her lap like the page needed to breathe. Vina filmed the back of everyone\u2019s head and provided commentary in a whisper that resisted its own impulse to be loud, catching the coach at one point tilting his cap down over his eyes in a gesture that could be interpreted as a nap or a treaty. The road unfurled in its usual patchwork of crops and concrete, and in a field just before Karawang a thin row of banana plants stood like a sketch, their leaves torn by wind into long fingers that had given up pretending to be whole, and Dara let herself look without composing a defense, the image entering and departing like a busker\u2019s song you enjoy without tipping because you have to conserve coins for later.\n\nRagunan felt different when you arrived with the knowledge of leaving soon. The dorm\u2019s corridor offered the same smell of disinfectant and ambition, but it was less heavy, like an unresolved chord that would resolve within days. The national coach watched them arrival-jog around the grass with his arms crossed and his jaw doing its usual impression of a tool, and his assistant\u2014a woman younger than all their knees\u2014took attendance the way a cashier counts exact change, head down, eyes counting more than names. They loosened with drills that made a person feel ridiculous until the ridiculousness worked, knees up like a puppet, hips forward like a show-off, arms disciplined like a child in a fancy restaurant. Bu Rara found them where shadows gathered in a neat line and asked for five minutes without the stopwatches, which made the national coach perform indignation and then shrug because even he knew he wasn\u2019t the only god here. She gave them a little script: pick three things you will notice in the call room that have nothing to do with you, pick one thing on the track that will anchor you if your head starts becoming a liar, pick one sentence you will say to yourself only once. Dara wrote on her own mind with the new chalk: scuff marks in chair three, the pattern on a volunteer\u2019s lanyard, the number of knots in the mesh over the window, the way the eight takeoff marks look when you walk in lane five, the sentence that was not lyrical and had the decency to be plain\u2014keep hips, count, breathe.\n\nAt the hospital, the news had learned how to walk instead of run. The doctor made a shape with his hands that looked like a cup half full of water and said numbers in a tone that had been trained to translate caution into optimism without breaking either. Engraftment had begun like a neighbor knocking lightly at the door then deciding to let themselves in after all. Their mother slept in half-hour pieces and cried in bathrooms only she allowed to know that, and their stepfather patrolled the perimeter of the ward like a security guard who would gladly be demoted if someone else would take the shift; when the nurse scolded him for touching a button he was not supposed to touch, he grinned his apology in a way that announced that he would do it again if he believed the machine was asking for help. Rafi texted \u201cgo run\u201d with a frog emoji and a lightning bolt and then added \u201cdon\u2019t think, only do,\u201d which made Dara type a paragraph about the impossibility of thinking not thinking and then delete it because he was trying to give her a button she could push that wouldn\u2019t set off an alarm.\n\nThe call room on the first day of heats held the same hush that always made her grin internally, because hush in sports is never real, it is only vacationing noise. The volunteer with the lanyard had chosen a pattern of tiny foxes, and Dara counted them in her head for a few seconds and let it mean nothing. The chair three scuff mark had a particular crescent bite out of it, and she decided some sprinter had been nervous enough to dig heel into plastic and had then made a time he would remember for the rest of his useful mind because people like that deserve happy endings in your imagination if you are going to borrow their mark. Sari sat two chairs away and rolled her shoulders with the fatalism of a person opening a door to a room she had renovated herself. A woman from Balikpapan, compact and coiled, blew air out of her cheeks with a soft \u201cpuh\u201d that did the work of a joke without stealing any breath. When they were called, the numbers fell into mouthes and lived there briefly, then turned to lanes where they belonged.\n\nThe gun snapped the moment into obedience and then trusted the bodies to keep it there. Dara took the four like a sentence she had rehearsed enough to not hate, kept fifteen as if it were a liturgy, let the wall of air at two stop being a wall because she had told it so, and saw at three the old theatre curtain of shadow and refused to let it be the beginning of a play. Her hips stayed where coach and Bu Rara and gravity and her own stubbornness had agreed they should be, and her arms were as uninteresting as a chair leg, which in hurdle running is a compliment. She felt the small giving way at six that had become a friend she let walk beside her rather than behind or in front, and she used the switch like a tool, not a scandal, moving to sixteen with the economy of a person who does not announce she is leaving a party. Nine, which is where liars come to test your temper, offered its usual deal, and she refused it without drama. Ten was the same teeth as before; she bit back and leaned without begging the tape to love her. The clock gave her a time that did not cause arguments and did not require apologies. Sari across the way looked at her with the fast smile of a runner who had read the same paragraph and enjoyed it, and the Balikpapan woman exhaled her \u201cpuh\u201d again and added a \u201csyukur\u201d in that small, private way athletes smuggle prayers into secular minutes.\n\nAfter, the sponsor\u2019s assistant found her like a bee that had decided to be kind and asked for two sentences at the tent with the logo. The producer had set up a simple frame, thank her better angels, just a bench and the lines on the track behind, the rhythm concept manifesting as a visual heartbeat. The young host asked what she had noticed in the call room and, for once, she told the truth in a way that did not feel extracted: the foxes on the lanyard, the scuff on the chair, the way someone\u2019s nail polish had chipped into a map of an island she didn\u2019t recognize and loved anyway, the way the hush sounded like fabric being folded. He asked if she had been afraid and she said she had been more interested than afraid, and that line fell out of her mouth like something she had earned the right to say, and she saw, in the producer\u2019s tiny nod, the relief of someone who had been looking for a way to sell integrity without renting trauma. When they were done, she refused a branded energy bar with polite firmness and took instead an unbranded banana from the bowl, which made the assistant grin like a co-conspirator.\n\nThe final the day after decided to be petty about weather. The heat rose up from the track in a visible shimmy that threatened to give seconds away to anyone too stubborn to pay it respect. At warm-up, sweat slicked the line at the back of her knee where the joint speaks, and she adjusted tape by feel because the glue on skin behaves differently when the day has taken sides. Bu Rara found her with a hand on the shoulder from behind, a touch that contained history without needing to announce it, and asked, almost offhand, what her one sentence was today. \u201cKeep hips, count, breathe,\u201d Dara said, then added, because bodies love specificity, \u201cno heroics at seven.\u201d The national coach clicked his tongue in a rhythm that, to his credit, lined up with the metronome they were trying to live inside. Sari tightened her spikes as if she were screwing them into the day.\n\nOn the set, a small child in the stands screamed a name that sounded like theirs but might have been someone the child had invented. Dara set blocks with care, the fast ritual of fingers on metal, heel against pedal, palms on surface, mind trimmed to the line. The gun did not betray anyone with an uneven crack. She went out controlled, resisted the bright insult of the backstretch sun, counted the world into a comprehensible list, and then at four something small and quick\u2014paper? leaf? the ghost of a cloud?\u2014caught the corner of her eye, and her brain yanked at the old alarm like a lever you know is supposed to stop trains. She did not lift her head. She did not look for proof or confirmation. She fell into the drum that she now kept as a room inside her chest: laba-laba is a syllable with no assignment, a percussive, a nothing that keeps a beat, count, count, count. The bar came, it always comes; she moved over it with an economy that would not make a highlight reel but would make a coach sigh later in private with satisfaction. The switch later than expected felt like a choice she had already rehearsed in heat, the sixteen arriving like a friend who knew where the spare key was. By eight, the soldiers in her legs had begun to mutter, and by nine they had filed a formal complaint, and by ten everyone had agreed that this was exactly what they had trained to be able to hate. She finished with a time that made the stadium behave, not go wild, but respect, and she stood very still for a second because stillness is sometimes the loudest celebration a body can manage.\n\nShe did not win; Sari did, with a finish that had made everyone in the first row lean forward involuntarily, their bodies recognizing expertise. Dara came second, and it was a clean second, not a grudging one. When the board confirmed it with the impersonal kindness of capital letters, she let herself nod once, a movement so small it needed its own microscope, and then walked off because walking uses a different grammar from victory and she wanted to speak both. In the mix zone, someone stuck a phone toward her with the question about brand and resilience already cued, and she answered with a sentence that was part script and part truth, a compromise she was learning to execute without feeling soiled: people see what they can use; I run for what I can hold. The assistant caught her eye over the top of the phone and mimed a tiny bow and then steered the conversation toward shoes, which cost no one anything but money.\n\nIn the stands, her mother had come in a bus later than any mother would accept and sat in the second row because an aunt\u2019s cousin\u2019s son worked at the gate and had given her a wristband with more power than it deserved. She clutched a hand fan that had been a wedding souvenir from 2006 and waved it with a ferocity that could have moved weather if weather were polite. Her stepfather sat with knees wide, a man who had learned to take up space late and still wasn\u2019t entirely convinced of his right to do it, and he watched with the attention he gave to engines, listening for a misfire or a tick, relaxing when none came. When she jogged the courtesy circle and saw them, she did not alter her line because she had decided that was a kind of extra she didn\u2019t owe anyone, but she allowed her mouth to tilt in a way that would be visible only if you knew her face. Later, when they met in the concourse where air tries to remember breezes, her mother kissed her forehead with the awkwardness of everyone\u2019s eyes, and her stepfather shook the coach\u2019s hand like men do when a shared project has decided to behave and then ruined the moment by blurting out, \u201cSaya bikin halang rintang di rumah,\u201d with pride, and the coach, who understands artisan craziness when he sees it, said, \u201cYa bagus, tapi jangan sampai anaknya jatuh di dapur,\u201d and they all laughed, relief making the sound bigger than the joke deserved.\n\nThe call from the ward came when she was sitting on her bag trying to trick it into closing without compromising on snacks. It was short and clean. Numbers were good. The doctor had allowed himself the smallest smile on the mask, a movement you could almost miss if you did not know his face already. The nurse with the bracelets said the word engraftment with the same tone she uses to announce afternoon tea. Rafi himself, groggy and proud, said his white blood cells had finally stopped acting like old men in an argument and had allowed the new ones to join the club, and then he coughed and handed the phone to their mother who cried without apologizing for once. Dara told them about the race and did not make her own news into a smaller thing for humility\u2019s sake because she had learned that everyone in this family was allowed to have a headline sometimes.\n\nThe national selection meeting was an exercise in bureaucracy disguised as sport, and she sat through it with the patience of a person who has watched drips and beeps become a day. Names were read into rosters and pruned from them; someone\u2019s face fell in a way that made her look away because you don\u2019t ogle another person\u2019s falling. Her name came where she had hoped, not because she believed herself entitled to it but because the work had been done and the work had been the right kind. Sari sat back with that careful breath of someone who will not show relief where it can be counted against her, and they shook hands in a tight, feminine handshake that would look like nothing to anyone who didn\u2019t know these hands had both been educated by wood and rubber and scolding and failure and had learned how to carry a little joy without letting it slip. Vina got her relay spot and made the air taste like sugar for five minutes before deciding she had to post immediately to keep the sweetness from souring without her management. Naya\u2019s name was on a list that had once felt too pointy for her, and she let herself hold her face with both hands for a second and then went to call someone she needed to tell first.\n\nBack home, the sofa in the living room, that old argument turned furniture, received her with its cracked leather and its rude memory. The note her mother had tucked in the tape pocket had been found two days ago when she needed to fix a blister, and she had read it in the bathroom, sitting on the closed lid of the toilet with the old tile\u2019s flowers making their dated parade under her feet. She had folded the paper and put it in the back of her phone case because technology should carry these things when bodies run out of pockets. Her stepfather took her to the yard and pointed at the hurdle like a person introducing a child to a teacher, and she did two drills on it in her slippers because ceremony can sometimes cement love. He told her the drain hadn\u2019t complained in two storms, and she told him that drains and hamstrings are alike: they require maintenance and the acceptance that sometimes they will be stupid for no reason. He laughed and said he preferred engines because engines don\u2019t have histories, and she said engines lie, and he said everything lies if you listen to it wrong, and they both shrugged the way people do when they have found a disagreement that can live safely in the house.\n\nThe sponsor, encouraged by the clean narrative arcs of the week, sent a message asking if she would consider a long-form piece about \u201covercoming,\u201d and she replied with a sentence that had taken her months to learn: she did not overcome anything; she negotiated with it. The assistant sent back three heart emojis that felt sincere and a promise to educate. The producer sent a voice note saying she would bring only one camera if they did a porch interview and would leave if the dog started complaining about the tape again, and Dara said fine because you have to feed some machines to keep their teeth off more important things. She declined a request to film at the hospital and was surprised and warmed when the assistant wrote, \u201cOf course,\u201d and offered alternative images that did not require anyone to tell her brother\u2019s story for him.\n\nOne evening, when the light over the alley had decided to be theatrical, she walked to the warung at the end of the street to buy shallots and a packet of coffee her mother swore tasted better because it was cheap. A web had been strung between the two iron bars of a gate in a diagonal that would have offended any geometry teacher and delighted any child. The spider that had decided this was a good place to be was small and brown and unassuming, the project modest and efficient. A boy chased a ball nearby and did the clumsy feint children practice on impervious opponents, and he ran toward the gate, toward the web, toward the inevitable, and she could have shouted, and she did not, because you are allowed to let the world break its minor beauties and remake them tomorrow. The ball hit the post and the web shivered, then held, then gave a little, and the spider moved with the competence of its kind to adjust tension. The boy ran on. The day did not break. She bought shallots and coffee, and the seller threw in two chilies and a \u201cbuat cantik\u201d which had nothing to do with looks and everything to do with the way the aunties like to bless the girls who run past their shops and then run into television and then run back again.\n\nAt practice the next morning, the dog had finally abandoned the tape and had fallen in love with a cone. He herded it up and down the grass with an attention that would have made him a good assistant coach if he had owned a whistle. The sky over the stadium had acquired the color that makes even the laziest person consider sweeping. Pak Bram had them do a series that started simple and then made small, intelligent demands, and he grunted approval or dismissed slop with equal economy. Bu Rara stood with a notebook she may or may not write in and watched like someone who intends to steal a method and return it improved. Sari texted a picture of her breakfast with a caption that made fun of the coffee at the training center, and Dara sent back a photograph of the homemade hurdle with a filter that made it look more noble than it was. The sponsor\u2019s assistant posted a story of a chalk line and a count, tagged no brands, and wrote only \u201clatih,\u201d which made three teenagers in a school two streets over decide to go for a run that afternoon and argue later whether fifteen was a mystic number or just practical.\n\nIn the quiet before the next travel, with the track holding the day\u2019s heat like a memory and the city deciding how to spend its evening, Dara sat on the bleacher and thought about how much of this was accidental and how much was a plan she hadn\u2019t admitted to having. She would go again to the stadium with the bigger mouth and the lights that turn skin into armour or into water depending on the angle. She would visit the ward and take the role the chair had for her and not be heroic about it. She would say no to nets and yes to rhythm. She would put her hand in her shoe without speaking to God first. She would ask her stepfather to check the screws on the homemade hurdle because it had begun to squeak in a way that sounded like a rumor. She would run because she loved it more than she was scared of it, and some days that ratio would reverse and she would pay interest later. She would listen to the body\u2019s lies and the brain\u2019s lies and the day\u2019s lies and choose the version that allowed her to place a foot where it needed to be, on a line painted by someone she did not know, at a speed that made sense only to people whose hearts had decided that the best work is the work you carry inside your chest and never put down. She stood, counted to a number that was both an incantation and a joke, and went to stretch with the ridiculous elegance of a girl who had learned to move inside her own weather without making it the headline.",

                              "content": "She ran before the sun had decided what color to become. Bandung was a basin of mist, a bowl of half-breathed air, and she cut through it along the lane that still held night in its asphalt. On the backstretch, between the banana trees that leaned beyond the fence and the bleached sponsor banners, Dara could hear her own lungs and the soft thud of her shoes as if someone else were keeping time for her.\n\n\u201cLast set,\u201d Pak Bram called. His voice had a rasp that made everything sound like a warning.\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. She kept her eyes level, refusing to look at the hurdles spread along lane three like sleeping dogs. The hurdles were for later. The warm-up called for circuits and acceleration. She took the curve and pressed into the straight, shoulders low and loose, jaw easy. The mist pulled away. The city in the distance, beyond the stadium wall, paled with the hint of morning traffic.\n\nIf she kept her eyes on the ground three meters ahead, she didn\u2019t have to count, she didn\u2019t have to measure her footfalls. She knew them by how her hips moved, how the left calf tightened at seventy meters, how the right shoulder dropped when her concentration broke and she remembered\u2014no.\n\nShe cut that thought off like a finger pulled back before the flame. The brain is a liar. The body knows.\n\nShe finished the acceleration and walked back, hands on hips, heart shouting. A small thread of hair had come free from her ponytail. It tickled her cheek like a whisper.\n\n\u201cWhy you look like someone\u2019s chasing you?\u201d The voice came from the fence. Vina had draped herself over the railing, her smile lazy and sharp. She was a sprinter, a snapped elastic band coiled in human shape. She saw things, then told them to the wrong people.\n\n\u201cI have a coach,\u201d Dara said, keeping her breath even. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I listen to him sometimes.\u201d Vina winked toward the middle of the field where Pak Bram hunched as if he could will them all into speed by compressing his bulk into a boulder. \u201cYou know there\u2019s a rumor you made him change the schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear rumors.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone hears rumors.\u201d\n\nDara pretended to tie her shoe. Traffic sighed beyond the stadium. A bird, one of the brown, ordinary ones that nested in the tunnel lights, skittered along the metal struts and dropped something unidentifiable onto the track's border.\n\nThe hurdles in lane three leaned with smug inevitability.\n\nShe took water from her bag, sipped, swallowed, and didn\u2019t let herself look further into the bag where the tape was, the spikes, the little sachet that made her palms dry out as soon as she saw it. Among her socks, the sachet rattled like teeth.\n\n\u201cLangsung ya, Dara.\u201d Pak Bram clapped. \u201cFive sets. We go over, we go back. Pace is race. No cutting.\u201d\n\nThere were some murmurs, someone groaned, someone else half-laughed. Dara set the bottle down. She jogged to the start of the lane, to the first hurdle, the metal paint flaking off a little where the adjustable legs had rubbed too often.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Naya whispered. Naya had a voice like rain. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Dara said.\n\nThey stood the hurdles. The metal legs squeaked. She could see the small rust-dark circles where rubber feet had been ripped off and replaced. Her lane looked like a sentence spelled out in obstacles, punctuation marks that only made sense when she ran.\n\n\u201cSiap?\u201d Pak Bram\u2019s whistle was in his mouth, his fingers around the stopwatch.\n\n\u201cSiap,\u201d they said, a little chorus, the words rolling and making light of everything.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be bad. Not now. There was nothing in the open. They always searched; they always\u2014they? She laughed at herself, a tiny, mean laugh in the back of her throat. They, as if the spiders were a gang with a leader, a strategy. As if the one that had been her first wasn\u2019t\u2014no. Focus.\n\nThe first set, she lifted, drove the knee, counted her steps to the takeoff, the same rhythm she always had, the one she had drilled into the muscle between calf and shin, into the angle of her hip, into the hinge of her ankle. She cleared, she landed, the world contracted to a route and a breath. Nothing shifted in the periphery. No black or brown or anything flickering. She felt good, even ease. She turned at the end, slowed, walked back, tasted the metal in her mouth that comes when the morning is cold and your lungs are trying to make fire.\n\nShe could do this.\n\nSecond set, she clipped the third hurdle. The stumble made her vision bump for a second. She let the adrenaline go through her and out. When she landed, a movement bloomed at the edge of her left eye. Something on the next lane over, small, almost a dot, fast in that lurching way that made her whole body smell like it's already sweating.\n\nIt was nothing. A drop falling from the metal. A leaf. A\u2014don\u2019t think the word.\n\nShe cleared the fourth, the fifth. Her stride shortened; she overcompensated; she felt the trail leg catch and pulled it back with a grunt that Naya would hear later and ask about.\n\nWhen she walked back after the set, the small movement was where her bag was, by the fence, on the concrete lip. She told herself she would not look. She told her brain no. She looked.\n\nA spider, not big, not\u2014maybe the size of a thumbprint if a thumbprint were a waiting thing. Brown, body a little low, legs quick and pointed the way stray nails point out from a beam. It was on the outside of her bag, near the zipper pull. A line of web that you could mistake for a hair had already touched the metal.\n\nNo. No no no. It was nothing. They were always somewhere. This was outside. But inside, in, inside where her socks were, where she had put her shoe, where her\u2014she couldn\u2019t stop the image of a narrow space into which any number of brown bodies could press. She felt the place below her rib tighten, the stomach\u2019s fist.\n\nShe heard Vina from the other lane. \u201cDara? You slowing? Come on lah. This is just practice.\u201d\n\nShe tried to unclench. She tried to breathe past the rust.\n\n\u201cNext two sets double pace,\u201d Pak Bram shouted. \u201cWe need race speed. This is not a picnic.\u201d\n\nDara moved to the start again. She didn\u2019t look at the bag. She didn\u2019t look anywhere except the hurdle top bar, white and scratched, the chip that looked like a small tooth mark, her mark that she had made weeks ago.\n\n\u201cReady,\u201d she whispered to the track, to the ground, to her legs whose memory was sometimes more reliable than her heart.\n\nShe went. Everything came up to meet her: the first one intimately familiar as a bedpost at night, her own hands on the sheets. The second a suggestion of risk that she took with the casual courage of a practiced risk-taker. She landed, two steps, three, takeoff, push, flick. Breath. The third came wrong. Something sunk its tiny hooks into her lungs. On the edge of the lane, at the foot of the fourth hurdle, a small blackish tangle had lodged in the ragged seam where track and grass met. It moved.\n\nHer legs made their decision before she did. They curled, they refused. She brought up her foot early and the hurdle told her immediately that she was wrong with the sharp crack of shin on wood. She went down hard, palms, knees, the taste of something that belonged to last week\u2019s rain and the rubber of thousands of soles.\n\n\u201cDara!\u201d Naya\u2019s voice, close but not touching.\n\nShe rolled to her back to get her knees up, to make space in her chest. The sky above the stadium was a blue so pale it reminded her of hospital sheets.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Vina said, coming up with that smile that never held her own teeth with anything but contempt. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? Aduh. The champion is kissing the track.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Dara said, breath choppy. She sat up. Her shin throbbed with the ache that says it will grow into a dark bad-looking bruise and be a story later. She could feel grit sticking to the blood.\n\n\u201cIt was just a stumble,\u201d Naya said. She offered a hand. Dara didn\u2019t take it.\n\n\u201cAgain,\u201d said Pak Bram, and the word cut everything else.\n\nShe stood. The tangle at the fourth hurdle had resolved itself into nothing now, or into something that had been scuffed away. Her bag by the fence was only a bag. She went again. She did not fall. The next set she took with the blind loyalty of a dream. When she finished, she could already feel the punishing conversation that would follow. She took her bottle again and tried not to glance down into the mouth of it for anything that might have floated in.\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d said the coach finally, as if he had kept himself from saying it for years and now was paying himself back in one syllable. He stomped to them. \u201cDara.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Pak.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome.\u201d He walked away from the group toward the lane marker painted like an old scar.\n\nShe followed, wiping grit from her knees and smearing it wider until she stopped, embarrassed at her own hand, and let it alone.\n\n\u201cYou have to deal with this.\u201d He gestured without looking at the hurdles, at the track, at her face that probably still had one drop of blood near her lip. \u201cThis thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t seem to know. You are the fastest on this team at 400 with barriers. You have a chance to go to Jakarta again next month and maybe further. You can\u2019t do that if you stop because\u2026\u201d He searched for the word. \u201cBecause a small animal walks nearby. It\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d\n\nShe felt the skin on her chest tighten. \u201cI didn\u2019t stop because\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did. I see it. You see it before your feet see the hurdle, and when you do, your hips go back like you\u2019re an old man carrying a sack of rice. You are not an old man. You are my runner. Tahan. Hold.\u201d He set two fingers against her sternum. It was not tender. \u201cYou have to hold.\u201d\n\nThe stadium had more wind now. It found her sweat and made it feel like fish scales.\n\n\u201cI can hold,\u201d she said, and her voice either broke or was broken by some small pressure.\n\nHe watched her for a long second. His face, which could harden into a concrete slab when he wanted the boys to stop laughing and get serious, softened in a way he probably didn\u2019t know how to show. \u201cYou can. I know you can. But you have to choose to. Otherwise what am I doing here? You think I like waking up to watch you run into the ground like a cow? I want to be proud. I want to be proud and drink coffee at noon and say to my friends, \u2018That one is my girl.\u2019 So. Stop looking. Stop thinking. Hm?\u201d\n\nShe nodded. \u201cYes, Pak.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Now, clean your leg. We go again in twenty.\u201d He left before she could nod again. He liked to leave on his own lines.\n\nShe stood there a moment and watched the air move the grass beyond the lanes in waves like a hand smoothing something that was not hair, not a shirt, something alive that needed to be calmed. When she bent to roll her sock down and see the shin, the blood had drawn a line like someone had tried to mark her for identification.\n\n\u201cYou want my antiseptic?\u201d Naya had come up quietly. She held a small bottle that looked like it had seen too much action in small bathrooms.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Dara said. She took the bottle and the cotton. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHush. If we let you bleed, Vina will brag she beat you because you fainted.\u201d Naya smiled with only her eyes. She always saved the actual curve of her mouth for later.\n\nThey cleaned the scrape and taped it. The dull throb turned into a warmed coin spread under the skin. Dara could deal with that. Pain was easy. Pain was ancient.\n\n\u201cIs he right?\u201d Naya asked finally, as if she had said hello after an entire day. \u201cAbout why you stop?\u201d\n\nDara laughed in a way that made no sound. \u201cI see things sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t like\u2026?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate them.\u201d\n\n\u201cLots of people hate them. They\u2019re not nice to look at.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate the look. It\u2019s the\u2026 the moving. The quick. The surprise. They don\u2019t belong and then they do, suddenly, and the place becomes theirs. My head becomes theirs.\u201d She kept quiet for a second, aware she had said too much. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not stupid if you feel it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is stupid because I am not eight years old in a banana plantation. I am not\u2014\u201d She stopped. She had already said too much.\n\nNaya nodded like she\u2019d known where Dara\u2019s sentence ended for a long time. \u201cSometimes the body keeps talking about things after we think the conversation is over.\u201d\n\nDara handed back the bottle. \u201cKayak tukang bakso who keeps shouting even when he passes your street.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d Naya laughed. The court beyond the fence had started to fill with futsal players whose jerseys didn\u2019t match and who had more enthusiasm than any of them. \u201cEat something after. You go to hospital later?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe.\u201d The word tensed her tongue. \u201cHe has a new number.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe blood?\u201d Naya kept her tone light, but her eyes, again, did the seeing. Everyone who has been to a hospital enough knows how many numbers there are and what they are worth.\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to come?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Thank you.\u201d She didn\u2019t say she wanted to go alone because Rafi told better jokes when it was just the two of them, because he would mock the way she sat on the edge of the bed like a hawk ready to skewer anything, because he would ask for her earphones and pretend to hate her playlist and then ask for it again.\n\nThey went back to the track as the mist lifted fully and left the lanes like an unmade bed. Dara ran. She ran as if the stadium were the only place that would hold her, as if the city behind the wall would, at any moment, lift itself up and walk away. She ran until the muscles in her back sang in a flat tired voice. She went home by an angkot that smelled like fried noodles and cheap cologne. She sat by the window and let the city\u2019s streets string themselves past: the toko roti her mother liked because the bread was always too sweet, the school gate where students hung in clusters like grapes, the billboard with a bright picture of a phone she couldn\u2019t afford that told her she was behind, behind, behind.\n\nAt her house, her mother had left the window open to let the rain-smell out. The living room had a peeled leather sofa that had been new when her stepfather showed up with it after the wedding. He insisted that a sofa said things about a family. Dara had said nothing. She had not touched the sofa for two days after the delivery, which made her mother laugh and then cry. People have odd instincts about territory.\n\n\u201cSudah pulang?\u201d her mother called from the kitchen.\n\n\u201cUdah,\u201d Dara said. \u201cYou made something?\u201d\n\n\u201cCilok. Your brother\u2019s favorite. But he can only have a little. No pepper.\u201d\n\nDara smiled, then shaped her face into something casual and not greedy. \u201cI\u2019ll wash first.\u201d\n\n\u201cJangan lama. The taxi to Rumkit Hasan will be here in half an hour.\u201d\n\nShe went to the bathroom and washed her face, her hands, her legs. She stared at the purple bruises on her shin and thought of a map, a place you could only get to by making the wrong turn at least twice.\n\nIn her room, the wall held the medals that meant something and the medals that meant nothing but looked nice because they were round and shiny. A photograph of her father\u2014her first father\u2014stood on the desk in a cheap frame that had lost a corner. He had been a man whose wrists never sat easy; someone had always told him to do something else since he had been born. He had left when she was twelve and then one day had not been part of any more stories. Her mother had filled life with other things: a job at the laundry on Jalan Buah Batu, a stepfather with a motorcycle and an opinion on everything, a boy who was the stepfather\u2019s and then was hers too. Sometimes you adopt each other without discussion.\n\nShe sat on the edge of her bed and, with a careful slowness that was neither superstition nor faith, reached into her shoe to check it was empty. She had learned to do this with the indifference of a person who had taught herself not to puke when she did. Her fingers found only the smooth insole and a little grit in the heel.\n\nShe took a breath that made the back of her throat buzz. She took a second one because the first had felt useful.\n\n\u201cDara!\u201d her mother called.\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d Dara called back, and the sound spun off the walls.\n\nThe hospital had corridors that sounded the way sandals do on tile in the hours when errands have settled down. Every time wasn\u2019t the first time, but every time was. She never got used to the grin of the sanitizer dispenser, the way it smacked the palm and made your hands smell like a hotel that promises you everything. She never got used to the way they ended up walking slower when they reached the ward. Practicing leisure for a place that has none.\n\nRafi sat cross-legged on the bed with the IV line barely moving and his hair trying to be hair again. His eyes had learned to be older and then had gone back to whatever age they wanted when he was with her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he said, with the kind of smile that made the nurses forgive him for everything.\n\n\u201cI brought music,\u201d she said, ignoring the accusation because he enjoyed it. She set her bag down. \u201cAnd news. And I\u2019m sweaty so you\u2019re lucky you can\u2019t smell me through the mask.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeh. You always smell like stadium soup.\u201d He leaned back, exaggerated a swoon. \u201cWhat news? Is the coach still a rock with a watch?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is more of a watch with a rock attached.\u201d She pulled a chair up to the bed, felt the leg catch on the edge of the rug someone had put to make the room not a room. \u201cHe told me to stop looking.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood advice. Most things are uglier when you look.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re ugly when I look,\u201d she said, and he laughed the way people laugh when they live inside a body that hurts often: carefully, but with real light.\n\n\u201cHow many today?\u201d\n\n\u201cFive sets. Then he yelled. Then I made him proud. A little.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything you do you do loud, even if you don\u2019t speak. You don\u2019t need a coach to yell for you.\u201d\n\nShe wondered if he knew about the stop, about the aimless fear that had knocked into her like a small animal hitting your ankle when you\u2019re trying to climb stairs. She wondered how much she let him see when she pretended not to. She didn\u2019t want to be another thing that needed nurse eyes.\n\nHe took her hand and squinted at the bruises. \u201cYou fell.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. The hurdle and I had a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should see the other guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other guy is metal.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sister fought a machine and survived. Nice. Did you get video?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She paused. \u201cWhy do you want everything in your head to be on a screen?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause my head is weird sometimes.\u201d He tapped his temple with one finger, making a small rhythm. The IV tape quivered. \u201cThe screen is like a window. You can decide when to look out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how windows work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my house they do.\u201d\n\nShe would have let the joke sit there, because she liked it when he played with light that way, but his mother\u2014her stepmother\u2014appeared at the door with a look that said she was gathering things. Her hair, once always a tight bun, had softened into a practical knot with strands that seemed to choose their own work.\n\n\u201cKita doa dulu,\u201d she said. \u201cThe doctor will come. After that, we will see the blood, and then we will see what we will do.\u201d She looked like she wanted to perform calm for everyone and then sit in the bathroom and let her breath stall.\n\nThey prayed. Dara tried to make her thoughts small and clean. She was always bad at this part. Her brain wanted to run laps during prayer. Her brain wanted to test its own pace. She gave up and just said thanks in as many ways as she could think: for the bed not creaking under Rafi when he turned; for the nurse who had told him a ridiculous joke about cucumbers yesterday; for the morning that had moved forward without asking her to promise anything.\n\nAfter the doctor came and said things about counts and numbers and how they were already, thankfully, creeping. He didn\u2019t use the word miracle because you\u2019re not allowed to in a coat, but there was something in his face that refused to be neutral. A little lift. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he does with this next cycle,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s strong.\u201d\n\nWhen he left, a nurse leaned in and took a reading. She made the professional face. When she turned, she made a small smile at Dara that was almost a private conspiratorial thing: I know you. You did good by showing up. The gesture was quick and vanished. Sometimes the humans do that at hospitals. They opt for kindness between tasks. People act like it is nothing. It saves lives in inches.\n\nRafi was quiet, his chin tucked, the way he got when he was about to say something he had rehearsed. \u201cI saw a spider today,\u201d he said softly, playful on the first syllable and then not.\n\nShe felt the blood pull down in the back of her throat. \u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the window. On the outside. Not\u2026 It was like the smallest. The wind moved and it tried to stay. It was doing something impossible and refusing to admit it. It made me feel brave for\u2026 I don\u2019t know why. You would have hated it.\u201d He looked at her. They were not ones for direct looks; the family was made of people who preferred side glances and jokes. He looked at her and said it. \u201cYou\u2019re not okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI fell,\u201d she said again. \u201cThe hurdle had an opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then there was\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t say the word. It caught like a laugh in the wrong part of the throat.\n\nHe squeezed her hand once. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to run all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do, actually.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. You want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. And?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all. That\u2019s enough often.\u201d\n\nShe glanced at her mother at the other end of the room, neatly arranging the biscuits as if their order would encourage some organ to behave. Her stepfather was not there. He had taken an extra shift at the workshop. He did that when he didn\u2019t know what to do with his hands; he took machines apart and then put them back together to prove something to himself.\n\n\u201cCan you\u2026 When you are on the track, can you imagine something else? Like the spider is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d She laughed. It came out like paper tearing. \u201cIf I imagine anything, it comes. That\u2019s how it works. That\u2019s how it\u2019s worked since\u2014\u201d She stopped. He waited. She obeyed herself. \u201cSince I was a kid. I stuck my hand in a bunch of banana leaves and there was a nest. They scattered and then regrouped on my wrist like I was a new branch. You can have a whole army on you and it feels like you have invited them. After that, any time\u2026 It\u2019s like they have the only subs that don\u2019t sub out. You know what I mean?\u201d\n\nHe squeezed the hand again. \u201cI know what you mean. But. You are good at telling your body to do what you want. I\u2019ve seen it. You tell it and it listens. Mine doesn\u2019t do that most days. I tell it and it laughs.\u201d\n\nShe was about to protest, to tell him he was unlucky and she was lucky and that the universe assigned uneven loads of unfairness like a teacher who got bored and handed out punishments to the wrong kids. He lifted a finger to his mouth, a shh, a warm one, not an admonition. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to be scared of what scares you,\u201d he said. \u201cJust don\u2019t be bored by it. That\u2019s when it bites.\u201d\n\nThey watched a clip on her phone of a hurdler in Europe taking ten perfect strides between each obstacle, each footfall the same argument resolved each time with the same conclusion. \u201cLook at her,\u201d Rafi said. \u201cShe\u2019s not the fastest. She\u2019s the most honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means she\u2019s not lying to her own legs. She doesn\u2019t ask them to forget that they are legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should write these on the wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. In here.\u201d He tapped his head again. \u201cThe nurses think I\u2019m practicing for a drum circle.\u201d\n\nWhen she left that evening, the light had turned the building gold in a way that made everything feel like it had been paid for. She walked the corridor and caught herself thinking of a particular corner where she had once seen a spider squat like a punctuation mark. She did not look at the corner. She would not give it the courtesy. It could have the wall. It could not have her. She stepped outside into air that held all the exhaust of the day and all the fried promises of street food.\n\nAt home, her stepfather was on the sofa with the television flinging the news at him without asking for consent. He glanced at her and then back at the screen because daughters were not a type of news he knew how to report. \u201cHow,\u201d he said, flat.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cNumbers good.\u201d\n\nHe grunted. She wanted to hate him for making love sound like accounting, but he had cried once in the kitchen with his head in the sink and he had let her see it because he had had nowhere else to put the salt.\n\nShe ate cold rice and the cilok that she didn\u2019t tell her mother was too chewy and then she went to her room and lay down and thought of everything she had to do tomorrow and everything she had to avoid doing tomorrow. Her mind drew a little map where the stadium was in the middle, and around it were circles she had to run to get to a gate that would not open unless, unless\u2014what? She couldn\u2019t explain her own head even to herself. She laughed again in the dark because the laugh made the dark less smug.\n\nIn the morning, she woke before the call to prayer, her body remembering an appointment that the world had not yet made. She went to the stadium. The lane felt like a friend who sometimes told you truths you didn\u2019t want and sometimes just sat beside you. People were late because it was Wednesday and everything is slow on Wednesdays. She walked along the inside edge of the track and spotted a small, dead spider near the drain.\n\nIt lay on its back, like a fallen soldier that never learned to die in a way that didn\u2019t look melodramatic. Part of her wanted to kick it into the water that had gathered there like a mirror for small things. She stood over it and felt the little jump of disgust that was almost a habit. She breathed in. She said the word in her head that she had refused to say. Spider. Laba-laba. She said it again and again until the word was just sound, until the sound lost meaning and it became a drumbeat. The beat had nothing to do with the animal. It was a syllable. People made syllables into gods and enemies all the time. She would not give this one that honor or that hatred.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d said a voice. Vina. Always early when she could be seen. \u201cWhat you doing? Praying to the insects?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an insect,\u201d Dara said, softly enough for herself.\n\n\u201cOh, excuse me, Wikipedia.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Naya said, appearing like a small honest secret, like someone you forgot you had promised yourself you would be. \u201cWarm up?\u201d\n\nThey ran in easy circles, the kind that made your knees remember a younger time when your body didn\u2019t care that it was working; it thought play had just decided to grow a plan. The sky was mean and grey. The coach had not arrived yet. For ten minutes, they laughed at a dog that found a bit of tape and shook its head as if the tape were tapping back. For five minutes, they were alive in a way that made everything they had to do later feel like something that could be done.\n\nWhen the coach arrived, he was already frowning. \u201cWe have a visitor,\u201d he said, and they all stared at him. He pointed to the bleachers. A man in a soft jacket and neat shoes sat with his phone in his hand like it was a part of his blood. \u201cSponsor,\u201d the coach said. \u201cMaybe. If we don\u2019t behave stupid.\u201d\n\nThey lined up. They did what people do when new eyes arrive. They made their movement clean and crisp. Vina lifted off her block like a flame that had decided to pretend to be metal. Naya steered her breath like a conductor. Dara did not alter her stride as much as she wanted to because she knew the price of performance, because she could not afford the after cost.\n\nOn the third set of hurdles, during the return run, a small piece of paper fluttered across lane two and landed on her path. It shocked her with how her chest clenched. What became a spider, what becomes something else. A paper was not a body; it was as alive as a bucket. She planted, she lifted, she landed. The paper clung to her shoe for a second, then came off. The sponsor watched. The coach watched the sponsor. The morning watched them all like an indifferent old person who had seen better athletes, better deals, better excuses.\n\nAfter, the sponsor clapped in a way that suggested he was made of compliments, not of bone. He told them about shoes and opportunity and social media. He told them about how running could be a platform. He looked at Dara and held the look half a second longer than he had held the others. This made Vina\u2019s mouth do something too quick to be categorized. \u201cWe\u2019re all about stories,\u201d he said. \u201cThe city loves stories. You have a story, I think.\u201d He said it the way a fishing boat captain might say, I know this bay has sharks.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a story,\u201d Dara said, carefully tight.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cBut not everyone\u2019s story is\u2026 visible.\u201d\n\nWhen he had left, the coach patted Dara on the shoulder in a gesture that belonged to fathers in films. \u201cThis is good,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not make it a bad thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said, but some part of her was already making a list of everything that could go wrong if a stranger wanted to buy a piece of her life.\n\nShe went to the locker room after practice. It was concrete that had decided to be a room. The lockers had been painted a hopeful blue some years before. Now, the blue was a memory. There were shoes, a towel, a dead cricket near the drain. She opened her locker and reached for her bag and then pulled back, because when she had opened the zipper a month ago at the other stadium across town, a wolf spider had leaped out like a question you didn\u2019t want to answer. It had landed on her shoulder, and she had made a sound none of them had ever heard her make. Vina had told the story three times in three different groups. By the end, the spider had been as big as a fist and had tried to take her medal.\n\n\u201cJust open it,\u201d she whispered. Her own voice was trying to act like a coach. It didn\u2019t even know where its whistle was.\n\nShe got the bag down to the bench and put it there. She put her palm flat against the rubber entire face of the thing and waited for the feeling in her hand to become normal. She pulled the zipper slowly. She saw fabric, shoes, a towel. A small hair caught in the teeth. No movement. She let herself look longer. She had to. She had to be able to see a thing for what it was for more than half a second or she would never outrun this. She would trip at a shadow and call it a predator.\n\nNothing. She took her towel and closed the bag and sat down and laughed in a real laugh that made one of the younger girls look at her as if she had said a marvelous lie.\n\nWhen she walked out of the locker room, she nearly collided with Vina, who had been waiting in a pose like a magazine. \u201cInterview,\u201d Vina said, tapping her phone. \u201cPeople asked who fell yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you tell them a meteor hit me?\u201d Dara said.\n\n\u201cI told them you saw your ex.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an ex.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Pity.\u201d Vina put the phone away. \u201cIt\u2019s all content, right?\u201d\n\nDara resisted the urge to wipe her hands on her shorts. \u201cI don\u2019t have content. I have legs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have fear. People like that. They can be holy about it.\u201d Vina tilted her head. \u201cTell me something, ya. You ever think that those of us who are not scared are bored?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou? You\u2019re bored with your own shadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love my shadow. It\u2019s the only thing that keeps up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are you always behind in races?\u201d\n\nVina laughed with genuine delight and the strange creature she turned into over the last ten meters of any hundred, where she could find teeth even on her elbows, disappeared, replaced by a girl whose father sold used tires and who had learned to make fun of herself before anyone else could. \u201cYou got me,\u201d she said. \u201cHey. Come tonight. Cafe near Braga. There\u2019s music. You need to be seen by people who are not wearing a stopwatch.\u201d\n\nDara thought of the hospital, of Rafi\u2019s eyes when he decided he would probably be alive at night and maybe wanted someone to tell him something he could not guess. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, and then softened it. \u201cNext time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say next time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne time it will be true.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to make it true.\u201d Vina flung a lazy salute and went, walking as if people were photographing her even while alone.\n\nDara took the angkot home. She ate with her mother and told her accountably cheerful lies and then she went to the hospital with a book she was never going to finish. Rafi was drowsy but not dreamy. He looked at her and then at the book and then at her again. \u201cRead me what you think is good.\u201d\n\nShe read until the page stopped pretending to be a page and became a river that ate the edges of the room. She read until he slept. She read after the sleep, quietly, because the words had turned into something that made the chairs less ugly. When she closed the book finally, she looked at the window. A small strand of web caught dawn\u2019s rumor hour light. There was no spider. She said the word again, without hatred and without worship. She folded it into a breath. Then she put it away.\n\nThe next day, the sponsor called the coach. The coach told them they were going to have a meeting, maybe sign a thing. Vina wore lipstick under her mask and Dara wore the plain face that had taken her this far. They sat in an office that smelled like air conditioning and new carpet. The sponsor asked her about her story. She said she ran. He asked her why. She said because. He asked her if she had any challenges. She laughed and said she had a brother whose counts had decided to play games and a coach whose heart had decided to be rude by caring too much. He told her she spoke like a television. She hated that a bit. But she smiled. It was not the time to teach the room how to talk.\n\nWhen she left, the coach touched her shoulder again. The touch had begun to become a habit. Habits are another way of agreeing with the world.\n\nLater, she sat on her bed and stretched and winced when the bruise reminded her it had been promoted to full pain. She scrolled through her phone. There were messages. The big group chat choked on its own jokes. Someone had posted a video from yesterday\u2014her stumble. Of course they had. The camera shook and the image was not humiliating so much as it was true. She was not a superhero. She was someone who could be wrong-footed by a small shadow. The comments had begun. They were many. Some were mean in the way people are mean when they are bored and want something to punch on their way to the bus. Some were supportive like a pillow that you put your face into and find too soft. Some said the word. Some wrote it like a threat. Some wrote it like a prayer.\n\nShe typed and then untyped a reply, a defense, a joke, a story. She put the phone down. She got up. She went to the kitchen where the tile was so old and white it had begun to decide to be yellow. She took an orange and decided to peel it like a person who had time. The peel came off in a spiral. She held it up like a little snake and then laughed at herself because she was being dramatic, because she always would be, because she was made that way before anyone had told her who she was supposed to be to make money from. She ate the sections one by one, the sting in her mouth like a new thought.\n\nWhen she lay down, the city was not quiet, but it was not the kind of loud that broke you. It was the loud that tells you you\u2019re part of a place and that place does not need you, and somehow that makes you feel safer because you can be there without earning it. She slept and dreamed that the hurdles were made of water and she had to run through them, not over them, and when she did, she came out on the other side wet but whole, and someone was clapping. Maybe the someone was her. Maybe it was a boy with tired eyes who laughed too loudly at cucumber jokes. Maybe it was the city, that old person again, clapping once, softly, for luck.",

                              "content": "Rain came in a fine sheet that made the red track look newly painted, and the stadium became a bowl of breath again, full of the sound of feet deciding what kind of day it would be. They did starts in the wet because most of the races that matter are run in weather that refuses to pick a side, and the way a foot meets slickness is part of a language you have to learn before you deserve to speak. Pak Bram told them they would have entries confirmed for Jakarta if the next two weeks didn\u2019t betray them, and he said it in the same tone he used when he said don\u2019t cut corners, the tone of an old promise he still believed in. \u201cWaktu target bukan doa,\u201d he said, and even though he tried to make it a joke, the stopwatch dangling from his neck swung like a pendulum that had been counting the same prayer since he was young. Vina ran with her shoulders daring the rain to get intimate; she said between sets that wet weather made the camera like her more and then laughed because she pretended not to care if the camera liked her, and Naya made a face and said, \u201cCamera likes everyone who moves like they mean it,\u201d and then glanced at Dara with that sideways honesty of hers that felt like a hand offered without announcement. Dara rolled a small stone beneath her shoe during a rest and told her calf to behave, and when the wind lifted a plastic bag past lane four like a ghost that had misinterpreted its own assignment, she let it be only a bag and refused to translate it into anything else. The brain is a liar, she told the rain in her head, and the body knows, and the body answered in the clean language of tendons sliding under skin.\n\nThe social media video had gone a little wider than anyone wanted; an aunt messaged her a sticker of a cat falling down stairs, a stranger told her she had to do yoga for her chakras, a boy from school she hadn\u2019t spoken to since last year wrote to say he believed in her like he had free belief to give away, and the sponsor\u2019s assistant had forwarded a link with a smiley face, which made her want to hit something soft. \u201cYou read comments?\u201d Naya asked in a breath that tried to be casual and failed with dignity, and Dara said, \u201cI scrolled until my finger remembered it had other work,\u201d and Naya said, \u201cGood,\u201d and that was the conversation they could have when they were running and life was measured in meters. After the last set, while they were shaking their legs and trying to convince the day to be kind, the coach said there would be a meeting after, someone from the sponsor wanted images, \u201ckonten kreatif,\u201d the words tasted like a syrup that had been in the cabinet too long, and he told them to be smart enough not to look stupid. \u201cNo drama,\u201d he added, and Vina grinned and said she was born allergic to no drama, and he aimed a scolding at her that landed softly, because it was raining and even his bark had gotten wet.\n\nThe hospital let Rafi ride a wheelchair to the rooftop garden after lunch because his numbers had behaved like good students for three days, and the nurse winked like she was granting a criminal a night off. The garden was a rectangle of stubborn green standing up to a city that had tried for years to convince plants they were old news; the benches had flaking paint in cheerful colors that were trying not to apologize for their shabby sincerity. A woman in a cheap blazer was crying on the phone near the jasmine and didn\u2019t notice anyone else, a child in a Spider-Man shirt kicked at nothing because nothing was the only thing that could take a kick without complaint, and a volunteer swept water from a corner and hummed a song from 1998 like she was still twenty. Rafi tilted his face to the grey and said he could taste the metal in the air and it was delicious because it tasted like outside, and Dara said she preferred her metal in hurdles and he said he preferred his metal in jokes. They watched a tiny bead of water find its way along a spider silk stretched between a railing and a leaf, and when it reached the dip, it paused because even water thinks before deciding some days, and then it dropped with a thrum so slight you had to want to hear it. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked without turning, and she said, \u201cI am tired of being interesting to myself,\u201d and he laughed and winced and said, \u201cSame,\u201d and then he went quiet the way he did when pain was coming up the elevator to their floor. She talked through it later, telling him about a dog at the stadium that had decided to adopt a piece of tape and lead it around like a pet, and he told her about a nurse who had told him his eyebrows were reliable, and they both let silence have its turn, because you have to share silence in a family or it becomes an enemy.\n\nThe content team wanted an old warehouse near the river because brick photographs well, and they wanted morning light, and they wanted \u201cauthentic movement,\u201d which made Dara want to show them a full practice and watch them try to keep up with the ugliness of a good session. The producer was a woman with glossy hair and a voice that would have sold rain to Bandung in November, and she said, \u201cWe love your energy,\u201d after saying hello, which was a sentence that made no sense and made perfect sense. A young man who wore his headphones around his neck like a scarf had a mood board on his phone, and when he turned it toward Dara she saw a picture of an athlete bursting through paper that had been cut like a web, and across it someone had typed in a font that looked casual on purpose: Face Your Fears. She took a breath and felt her stomach tense the way a hand does when it sees a candle and wants to know if it will hurt. She said, \u201cI won\u2019t do webs,\u201d and the producer blinked with surprise that was quickly covered with competence, and she smiled like flexibility was her birthright and said, \u201cOf course, of course, we will pivot, we are storytellers, not\u2026 designers,\u201d and then she turned to the young man and said in perfect polite Bahasa, \u201cGanti konsep ya,\u201d and he nodded and scrolled like the future was a menu. Naya, who had agreed to come as moral support and also because free snacks were free snacks, stood just close enough that Dara could feel the agreement without words, and Pak Bram arrived late because he had made the mistake of believing a friend who said Jalan Sudirman would not be jam at nine in the morning, and he said, \u201cNo lompat-lompat yang bodoh,\u201d as if that phrase could hold back the century.\n\nThey made her run across loose gravel while a drone made a sound like a dentist\u2019s daydream and a photographer in a shirt with tiny cameras printed on it shouted directions that sounded like prayers. \u201cLook at the horizon, think of something you want,\u201d he said, and she thought of a thousand small square meals that arrived in the ward on time and warm; he said, \u201cCan you give me determination,\u201d and she wanted to ask what wattage that came in; he said, \u201cLower your jaw,\u201d and she relaxed her mouth and thought about nothing because nothing is sometimes the only honest thing left. Vina arrived halfway through with clean lipstick and a speed that she put on like a jacket, and the room\u2019s attention shifted the way it always does when someone enters with a relationship to light, and she played with the lens in a way that dared it to try to capture her whole. \u201cYou see,\u201d the producer said to Dara between takes with the bright intimacy of temporary comrades, \u201ceveryone\u2019s different, I want your quiet,\u201d and Dara made a face she hoped read as grateful and not as the small animal sound she felt in the back of her throat. Someone set a coil of rope near the corner and someone else tripped over the coil and swore with the melodrama of youth, and Dara watched the coil, and for a second her brain announced that it had eight legs, and then she breathed and it became a coil again, and she moved her eyes, because you don\u2019t have to challenge every shadow to a duel.\n\nAt home, the workshop smell had followed her stepfather like a second jacket, oil and heat and the old sadness of machines that will never be new again. He set a can of insect spray on the kitchen counter as if he were presenting a trophy to the house, and he said, \u201cKalau di kamar ada, semprot aja,\u201d and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to make the room smell like murder,\u201d and he grunted in a way that could be read three ways and she chose the kindest. He stood there, hands on the back of a chair like he was steadying a ship, and then he said in a voice that had not been sanded smooth by time with her yet, \u201cWaktu kecil saya juga takut,\u201d and when she looked at him with more face than she intended, he looked away like the wall had asked him a question, and he said he had fallen into a flood at Cicalengka when he was nine, and the water had been a living thing with things in it, leeches and plastic bags and a snake and a chair that had decided to float by, and for years after that he could not shower with the drain uncovered because the sound made his knees think the river had come back. \u201cSampai sekarang kadang masih,\u201d he admitted with a little embarrassed laugh that had dust in it, and she said, \u201cOkay,\u201d because what else do you say to someone making a bridge he didn\u2019t know how to finish, and he nodded and picked up the can and put it back in a cupboard because he had heard her, which was new currency in the house. Her mother came in with a bowl of tempe bacem like the smell would solve arguments, and she asked them if they had eaten, and they said yes even though they had not, because sometimes love starts with a lie that spares the cook for five minutes.\n\nThere were mornings when the stadium emptied of everything that wasn\u2019t running, a spell where the birds took their meetings elsewhere and the futsal boys slept in and even the cleaners delayed, and on one of those mornings they did a time trial because you have to practice fear at the same pace as you will meet it. \u201cYou run the whole set like it owes you money,\u201d Pak Bram said to the group, and he gave Dara a look that had the edges filed down, and she ran lane three the way you run when you suspect this version of yourself is the best one you\u2019ll get today. The first two hurdles rose and fell like questions she had memorized answers to and not in a way that made her feel fraudulent; the third carried the shimmer of a remembered mistake and she refused it entry; the fourth was positioned where the old tangle had been and her lungs flickered, and she said the word in her head without glue, laba-laba, laba-laba, until it became percussion, and she kept her hips where he\u2019d asked her to keep them, over the legs, not behind, and she landed with a sound that the track accepted. By the seventh, the world had narrowed to a corridor of breath and white bars and she felt the ache under her right shoulder that always arrived like a friend who needed a place to stay for the weekend and then cleaned up after themselves, and she smiled into the rain because even pain could be polite. When she stopped, her time was there on the coach\u2019s screen and it wore a tiny grin that belonged to numbers that had decided to be generous, and he grunted in a way that meant he would brag later without making it a transcript. \u201cDi ulang,\u201d he said, because you never celebrate the first good attempt, and she nodded because ritual is part of technique.\n\nAfter the second run, she walked with Naya along the grass because the lane can be jealous if you never leave it, and Naya told her about a cousin who had called to say she had seen the video and that fear wasn\u2019t a good brand and that she should tell Dara to get over it. \u201cAneh orang,\u201d Naya said, pushing a seed head with her shoe, \u201clike she never cried when the electricity died and she thought ghosts wanted her Netflix,\u201d and they laughed in the low way you laugh when you know laughter is one of the only therapies you can afford. Dara said she had an appointment at the hospital later because Rafi was due to change to a different regimen and everyone had to pretend to understand the math of it, and Naya squeezed her elbow, a small pressure that said she didn\u2019t have to tell stories to keep company, the company would stay anyway. The futsal boys bustled in like a parade of misfitting jerseys and someone\u2019s speaker played a song from summer, and the morning gave up its quiet with a shrug.\n\nThe sponsor\u2019s representative messaged with angles and metrics and asked Dara if she would be comfortable telling \u201ca little bit about your challenge,\u201d and she typed, \u201cI run the 400 hurdles,\u201d and sent it, and the typing bubble froze and then revived and then the answer came back with three laughing emojis and a gentle pivot, and she didn\u2019t give him anything else because not every truth was a bar of gold you chip off to pay a bill. Vina sent a selfie with the producer captioned \u201cMy new mom,\u201d and a second later another message, \u201cKamu juga ya jangan jadi anak tiri,\u201d and a little heart, and Dara didn\u2019t know whether to be warmed or warned, so she let the message sit without an answer until it fermented into nothing. She stood at the sink and peeled an orange again because she had decided the fruit was a practice, and when the skin came off in two pieces instead of one she didn\u2019t make it a metaphor, she just ate.\n\nIn the ward, Rafi had the look he got after the drip had been going long enough to make his jokes slower; he was still himself but the edges had been sanded and he was a little more tender to the touch without being sad about it. He asked her about the old warehouse shoot and she told him about the rope and the pivot and the drone that had tried to pretend to be a mosquito, and he asked if they\u2019d paid her extra for the rain and she said, \u201cThey paid me attention,\u201d and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s a currency that depreciates,\u201d and she threw a biscuit wrapper at him and he clutched his chest like a soap opera actor. Their mother\u2014his mother\u2014sat on the edge of the chair with her bag in her lap like the bag might get up and leave if not supervised, and she told them about a neighbor whose son had quit school to ride Gojek and who was now making more money than his father and how money didn\u2019t choose sides, it just wore the shirt of whoever showed up first, and they listened because listening was free and made people stand up straighter. The doctor came and did his polite summary and left behind a diagram that tried to make blood polite too, and when the room was theirs again, Dara said, \u201cEvery time I think I\u2019ve got it, my head plays me back a film I don\u2019t want to watch,\u201d and Rafi said, \u201cThen we make a new film on top until the old one is hard to see,\u201d and she said, \u201cWhat are the scenes,\u201d and he said, \u201cFirst scene is you eating all my pudding,\u201d and she said, \u201cI can do method for that,\u201d and their mother made a sound that came from a place before language and smoothed the sheet for the third time, and the machine beeped the way machines do when they are trying to be reassuring and failing but trying matters.\n\nOn a Thursday, the coach did a thing no one expected and asked a woman in a hijab and track pants with a posture that had not forgotten sprinting to come and watch them for an hour. He said her name was Bu Rara and that she had once run the two hundred until her hamstrings had decided to be dramatic, and now she worked with heads for a living; he said this like he was admitting to having a cousin in television. She watched them move and asked quiet questions that made it sound like she wanted to know what each of their shoes had to say, and she asked Dara between sets, \u201cWhat do you do when the picture shows up,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cI tell my legs they are not a screen,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood, and then what,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cI breathe until the syllable becomes only a syllable,\u201d and she nodded like that was a tool she would steal if she could and asked if she ever let the fear get bored, and Dara laughed and said that line belonged to her brother and she was just renting it. After, the coach hovered like a teacher trying to pretend not to hope for extra credit, and the woman told him they had good bones and dirty habits, and they could clean them, and he snorted because he does not believe in tidy minds, only in work, but he listened, which is a form of faith.\n\nThere was a day when the drain at the far corner failed and the track held a shallow lake with an ambition, and someone found a frog floating in an expression of resignation, and Vina squealed and jumped up on the bleacher like the frog had a grudge, and Naya coaxed it toward the grass with a shoe like she was negotiating with a bureaucrat. Dara watched from a distance where the frog could be a frog, and then a breeze unrolled a web between two posts like a tiny flag at half-mast, and there, at the center, a spider no larger than the head of a pencil sat in an attitude of ownership, and she felt the old electricity climb her spine like a song you cannot stop hearing because you were fourteen when you heard it on a bus. She did not walk toward it because courage does not always look like proximity, but she did not re-route her warm-up either; she let it be the corner\u2019s corner, and she ran her arcs and her steps and her drills with the exactness of a person filing away one day that will not be the day she breaks, and when a lace came loose she did not make it a message. Later, while packing her bag, she stuck her hand into a shoe without making a ceremony of it, and when her fingers found only the insole and the grit and not a small panic with legs, she smiled with her whole face because you should let yourself have your own victories.\n\nThe message confirming her lane assignment for Jakarta arrived with the tone her phone used for announcements that mattered, the one she had chosen in a moment of melodrama when she wanted her life to have trumpets. She stared at the text as if it were a person in the room and said out loud to no one, \u201cLane five,\u201d and then she said, \u201cOkay,\u201d with a long inhale that made the door to her room look like it had thought about being a finishing line. She thought of the stadium in Jakarta, of the way the sound there came off the seats like a slap, of the heat that came up off the track and made your calf talk to your patience, and she thought of Rafi\u2019s eyes when she would call and he would say, \u201cHow many steps,\u201d because he liked the math more than the result, and she thought of the sponsor\u2019s clean office and the old warehouse and the rope and the refusal and felt her mouth pull into something that was not quite a smile because the smile would come later.\n\nNight collected around the neighborhood with its usual untidy efficiency; a motorbike coughed and somebody\u2019s grandmother shouted for a child who had learned to answer at volume only when paid in fried things, and the cat that kept pretending their roof was a river crossed above with a confidence that insulted gravity. Dara lay on her bed not sleeping yet, hands behind her head like a clich\u00e9 she forgave herself for, and she traced the journey from the start to the tenth hurdle in the dark as if it were a prayer that didn\u2019t mind being touched. She remembered the banana leaves and the nest like a rumor with legs, and how her father had laughed when she told him before he left laughing altogether, and she felt the old shame tug at the hem of her breath, the shame of being taken by surprise and making a sound that betrayed you, and she said out loud to the ceiling, \u201cI forgive the sound,\u201d and the ceiling said nothing because it was a ceiling, and she left the room for a glass of water and on the way past the living room her stepfather coughed into a fist and said without looking up, \u201cBawa jas hujan ya nanti,\u201d as if rain were always possible, and she said, \u201cI will,\u201d and meant it like a promise to the city.\n\nOn Friday, the producer called to say the sponsor wanted to do a live stream after practice next week and that there would be questions from followers, some of whom would be children, which could be the cruelest audience in the world, and Dara said, \u201cNo spiders,\u201d and the producer laughed and said, \u201cWe are a brand, not a zoo,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cI like zoos; animals are honest,\u201d and the producer made a sound like a spoon on a glass and promised a set that would be nothing but lines and light. The coach, when told, rubbed his forehead as if that could refund minutes, and then said fine, but no extra running for a camera and no missing stretches for a camera, and he passed on a message from an old friend of his in Jakarta, a man who had once run the 800 like it owed him a house and who now sold rice cookers, and the message was, \u201cDon\u2019t give them your soft underbelly for free,\u201d and Dara wrote it on a scrap of paper because sometimes old men see the same wolves.\n\nThat afternoon, the sky finally cracked and gave them real rain, fat and hard and bored of being polite, and the city smelled new and rotten at the same time, and in that honest wet, the drains did their song and the track thickened and everywhere small things looked for higher ground. Dara walked the perimeter in a poncho that made her look like a conscience and watched workers prop open a door with a brick and a broom, and she stepped around a flow of water carrying leaves like tiny boats, and when a small spider, displaced and furious in the way only tiny kings can be, pinwheeled out of a drain and tried to make a claim on a patch of dry concrete, she felt her pulse go dramatic and then slow, because there was nowhere for it to go otherwise, and she said the word in her mouth quietly once for her and once for the animal, and then she kept walking because staying is sometimes an agreement you can\u2019t afford. When she reached the bleachers, Naya was there with a towel over her head like a monk and a grin she couldn\u2019t hide, and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re outside,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cEveryone\u2019s outside,\u201d and Naya said, \u201cYes, but you, now,\u201d and it took Dara a breath to hear the meaning.\n\nThe coach gave them a rest day before the travel, which meant, in practice, that he told them to do the work at home where he couldn\u2019t see it, and she did, because being unsupervised is not the same as being free. She texted Rafi that she would stop by after picking up a singlet, and he replied with a sticker of a dinosaur nodding like approval, and she sat on the angkot watching a man with too many boxes pretend physics were a rumor, and she thought about the moment of the gun, how it is a tiny explosion that pretends to be official, and the four steps to the first hurdle, and the way the last two always belong to an argument between fatigue and form. She could hear the city rehearsing its part in her head, the cheer that belongs to strangers who love the idea of running more than the runner, and she decided not to resent them for that; she needed ideas too.\n\nOn the ward, a new patient had arrived, a teenager with hair bleached a color that did not exist in forests, and he had a group of friends who made too large a noise in a way that was a protest against the quiet, and Rafi watched them with the mixed expression he gave any gathering: a little envy, a little tenderness, a little anthropological interest. Dara told him about lane five and the weather forecast and the rumor that an athlete from Surabaya had gotten a new coach with a reputation for cruelty disguised as excellence, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t give the rumor your breath,\u201d and she said, \u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d and he said, \u201cGood,\u201d and then he dozed in the way that made his hand heavy in hers, and she read the same paragraph three times before realizing the book wasn\u2019t the point, the chair was. Their mother came back from the canteen with a bag of crackers like she had conquered something and said she had run into a nurse who used to train for volleyball and who had said that pain on court was education and pain off court was a teacher with a stick, and they smiled because they liked it when the world kept bringing them metaphors as if language could be interest paid on suffering.\n\nShe left before the rain returned and walked past the corner where she had once refused to look, and she looked because she could, and there was nothing, and that was a kind of blessing, absence as mercy. At home, she packed with a discipline that had become habit, tape and spikes and snacks and the ridiculous little sachet that dried her hands because sometimes performance needed small cheats, and she put her shoe in the bag after checking it twice without flinching because practice had made that part unremarkable. Her stepfather knocked on the open door with all the awkwardness in the world and said, \u201cHati-hati,\u201d and then added, \u201cBangga,\u201d and then coughed because the word had surprised him, and she nodded with more face than she meant and said, \u201cMakasih,\u201d and her mother called from the kitchen that she had put fried rice in a container with a note because of course she had, and Dara said, \u201cYou put notes now,\u201d and her mother said, \u201cI put notes when I\u2019m scared,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cYou\u2019re scared,\u201d and her mother said, \u201cI\u2019m always scared,\u201d and they both laughed like a secret had been polite enough to introduce itself.\n\nThe bus pulled out of the terminal too late and too fast, the way all departures in the country do when optimism meets schedule, and she sat by the window with the glass at her shoulder cool and a thin film of dust that would become a story on her jacket. Ahead, the road unspooled its familiar promises, curves she\u2019d taken with classmates on school trips and with teammates whose names she no longer said out loud because they liked other sports now, and the driver\u2019s playlist did a tour of heartbreaks and victories that made the aisle a dance floor in someone else\u2019s imagination. Vina slept in a posture of total ownership and drooled without shame, and Naya watched trees the way a person collects green for later, and the coach pretended to be irritated by everything and secretly counted how many of them laughed without worrying about time. Dara pressed her palm flat to the window when the bus passed a stretch of fields where banana plants stood with their leaves bruised by last month\u2019s wind, and she felt the old story try to sit in the seat beside her, and she said, not out loud, not a spell, just a sentence: \u201cYou can ride, but you don\u2019t get to drive,\u201d and the story made itself smaller because she had not, this time, offered it snacks.\n\nThey crossed into a city that always pretends it is the center of the map and forgives you for believing it, and the stadium rose like a machine that had been built to hold breath, and her chest tightened in the good way because some places give you permission without asking for your credentials. In the hotel room that smelled like a thousand previous nerves, she and Naya unpacked with the ritual of a new camp: shoes under the chair, tape on the table, spare socks in the drawer because they would forget them otherwise, and snacks in the top of the cupboard because Vina would steal them if they were visible. The coach knocked and barked at them to be downstairs in ten, and they were, and he took them to see the track because you should not meet the lanes only when you are dressed to impress them; you should say hello in your ordinary clothes, in your traveling skin, so the track knows you don\u2019t want anything but mercy. The lines were whiter than home and the bars looked like they had been carved from official wood, and the wind said nothing because wind here is careful with strangers, and Dara walked lane five in flats and counted strides between empty hurdles and said the count under her breath like a psalm.\n\nThat night, in a bed that had seen every version of sleep, she lay awake longer than she liked and refused to name any of what her heart was doing, and finally she slept, and in the morning she woke before the call to prayer again because her body respects its own clock more than any bell, and she sat on the edge of the bed and tied and untied a lace while the city began its noise, and she thought of the dead spider by the drain, of the live one on a web that had survived a rooftop gust, of the rope coil at the warehouse and the boys with the drone, of her stepfather and the flood and the drain and his quiet confession, of her mother\u2019s note on the fried rice that she had eaten in the bus and the way the taste had been a childhood she hadn\u2019t noticed in years. She thought of Rafi counting her steps from a screen that would be too bright, and she thought of how he had said honesty like it was a metric, and she stood and did the things you do to make morning less wild: stretch, drink, wash, quiet your head, listen to your feet. When she met the team in the hallway, Vina bumped her shoulder with exactly the right amount of force and said, \u201cReady to be famous,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cReady to run,\u201d and Naya said, \u201cReady to breathe,\u201d and they laughed because they were all telling the truth.",

Warmth climbed up from the track as if the surface remembered all the legs that had argued upon it and wanted to whisper their sentences back at the new ones. The stadium breathed in a different rhythm from home, wider, louder, a throat that could swell in an instant. The warm-up track was a world adjacent to the world, a ring of work that smelled like rubber and old chalk and the particular sweetness of isotonic drinks that promise mercy. The call room had its own weather: a hush with corners. When they stepped in, a volunteer in a neat polo shirt and a lanyard that dimpled his chest said numbers out loud like they were names and pointed to chairs like they were assignments.\n\nDara pinned her bib with the practiced fingers of someone who has stabbed herself enough times to have earned care. Lane five, heat two. She rolled the edge of her hamstring against the stretch of a trigger ball and tried not to think of it as a lottery. The other women were versions of her and not her: a girl from Makassar with hair tight as wire and a face like a decision, a tall woman from Semarang with an expression that had eaten nerves and decided they were calories, a Jakarta athlete whose eyeliner was perfect and who would refuse to let sweat claim it. They all made little bargains with their shoes and their laces, with their shoulders, with the ghosts that had booked seats in their lungs. Vina popped in and popped out like a firecracker because her call time was later and she didn\u2019t know how to be anywhere for long without turning the place into a stage. Naya sat for a minute, quiet, a palm pressed into the back of Dara\u2019s shoulder until her hand warmed what lay under skin, and then she went to her own lane where the watch would try to measure something it didn\u2019t deserve to judge.\n\n\u201cFifteen to start,\u201d Pak Bram said softly, not looking at her because he didn\u2019t like to give the room the satisfaction of seeing him care. \u201cIf wind turns and you feel the one, decide early. No improvisasi on seven. Keep hips.\u201d He didn\u2019t say fear, didn\u2019t say picture, didn\u2019t say syllabus of phobia or ancient field report from a banana plant. He tapped twice on the top of her quad with two knuckles like someone testing fruit at a market and walked away as if he had delivered a package and had two more doors to visit before nine.\n\nThey sent them out in a small procession that tried not to look like a parade. The stadium widened and the sound, that animal that lives in concrete and plastic seats, lifted its head lazily. Dara stepped into the lane and let her eyes rest where they were meant to be: on the white lines, the takeoff marks, the quiet bar on top of the first hurdle that would be the first promise she would make and keep. The bruise on her shin had matured into a color that you could wear to a wedding if you didn\u2019t want compliments; tape held it like a considerate hand. She bounced twice, not for show, for the small interior calibration that made her ankles speak to her knees in a language no one else needed.\n\nOn your marks was not a sentence in this place. It was a ritual that asked you to believe in the flatness under your toes and the straightness of your intent. She set her blocks, felt the grippiness of the surface against palms, the cold of the pedals against spikes, the way her breath lit a small fire at the back of her throat. Set was a held photograph. The gun did not sound like a gun; it sounded like the moment lifting its face.\n\nThe first four steps were counted and not counted, done and forgotten as they needed to be. Hurdle one came and went like an old friend who doesn\u2019t require greeting. Fifteen between. Two, breath and teeth soft, the ground rising and falling on schedule. Three was positioned under a piece of shade thrown by the big screen itself, and for a half of a step her brain wanted to assign meaning to the darker, wanted to film a movement that was not there, and she answered with the drum of syllable she had practiced until it meant nothing but meter\u2014laba-laba-laba\u2014until the mouth told the eyes to relax, and the eyes obeyed because the body likes to win an argument that feels honest. Four, she held; five, she made peace early with the switch to sixteen because the headwind had made the space between the bars feel a breath longer, and that decision saved the pattern from becoming a story in which she was the wrong character. On the backstretch, the noise settled into a hum so steady it could hold a person up. At seven, her right shoulder whispered its old complaint and she told it that she had rented the pain for the day and it could have it back tomorrow. Eight, nine, the body started itemizing debts, and ten arrived like a door you already had the key for, and then she was across and the line underfoot said nothing because the line never speaks to anyone; it simply is the definition.\n\nShe didn\u2019t win the heat. The Semarang runner did, with a tiny lift near nine that looked like she had banked a surprise. Dara\u2019s eyes flicked to the clock because everyone pretends they won\u2019t and then does. The number stared back and it wore the face of a personal best by a whisker that would need a microscope, the kind of margin you could argue with if you liked losing arguments. She exhaled a sound that the microphones would probably not pick up and walked on her toes to let the acid drain where it would not complain as loudly. The sweat on her lip tasted like a welding of salt and relief. The board said her name in block letters that felt like seeing your own handwriting on a wall, familiar and strange, and the small heart she had been carrying in her mouth slid back down to where it belonged.\n\nIn the mix zone, where strangers with microphones smile with their teeth and with their eyes and with their phones, the sponsor\u2019s assistant steered two cameras away with the diplomacy of someone who knew how to protect a story long enough to sell it properly later. \u201cRecovery dulu, ya,\u201d she said in a voice that would have calmed a roomful of cats. A boy with a student press badge and a shirt that wanted to be a dress shirt asked if fear was something you could train like quads, and Dara laughed in a full sentence and told him she preferred to train her hamstrings and mind and that fear was like rain: you learned to run in it or you went inside, but it wasn\u2019t a muscle and it wasn\u2019t a friend, it was weather. The boy nodded like he had been handed a phrase he would quote to someone attractive later and she felt a little bad for him because life would give him better quotes if he waited.\n\nBack under the stands, the cool air licked at the sweat on her neck with hotel enthusiasm. Pak Bram met her with a face that had both a frown and a bitten smile hidden behind it and said, \u201cBagus. Jangan percaya bagus,\u201d because he hated the way good tries to make people sleep. He tapped the screen of his phone where the splits lived and made a small face when it told him what he already knew, that she had given up a slice at six for a salvation at eight, and then he nodded because trade-offs are sometimes wisdom. Naya came in a few minutes later with that half-smile she reserved for when she had been brave without receiving any medals for it. Vina sent eleven messages in three minutes in the team group chat that was a chaos garden: a picture of her spikes next to a complementary banana, a selfie with a volunteer who looked like they were reconsidering volunteering, a video of a puddle trying to be a lake, a joke about lane draws, a sentence that began with \u201cManifesting\u2014\u201d and a disappearing sticker. Dara drank and let the cold sit in her stomach like a gecko that would flee if she startled it, and then stood so that her quads wouldn\u2019t turn into furniture.\n\nAt the hospital, a nurse had arranged two juice boxes in a way that made them look like a polite sculpture, and Rafi watched her via a stream that had the gall to freeze every time a face looked good. He had texted the count he guessed before the race and he had missed it by one step and felt proud of being wrong because it meant she had adjusted before he had, and he loved her most when she changed the math and it still added up. He sent three claps and a gif of an old man dancing and the words \u201chonesty metric going up\u201d and she wrote back a picture of the clock with his name drawn on it in a way only siblings would find funny. Their mother had learned how to check live results with a frown like she was trying to make numbers behave with scolding, and when the page rejected her three times she scolded the page, and Rafi told her to let the page calm down because the whole city was pressing on it and the city did not know how to take turns. He felt a warmth under his tongue that he liked to pretend meant hope but the nurse would say meant the steroid at four p.m., and he kept his eyes on the small screen that showed his sister continue to be the kind of human whose body could be convinced of things.\n\nIn the afternoon, Dara sat on the hotel carpet and counted breaths while rain threatened the window in a way that turned the city into a person who promised to show up at seven and then arrived at eight with a story. She filled the time with care: flush calves, take shoes out of bag so they could remember their shape, call home and tell her mother the room was clean and the bed was comfortable and the breakfast had fruit because those were the things her mother wanted to know, part protocol and part prayer. Her stepfather, who rarely took phones into his hand the way a man who has broken his fingers on engines doesn\u2019t take kittens casually, asked, \u201cSuasana?\u201d and she said, \u201cRame,\u201d and he grunted like he approved of a full room. He did not say the word bangga this time, and she did not ask for it; sometimes a word\u2019s previous appearance is enough to earn it a day off.\n\nThe final came sooner than her nerves preferred and later than her legs wanted. The sun is a kind of coach in Jakarta; it asks for loyalty and then punishes it. They taped and warmed and did the drills that are a language, A-skips and B-skips in a grammar you do not speak until your shoes know it. The call room\u2019s air conditioner was a tyrant and a mercy and the chairs were arranged to encourage a particular kind of silence. A volunteer with a face that could have stopped a fire by speaking politely checked spikes and asked them to sign something that meant they were present. The Semarang runner looked like she belonged in any room she entered. The Makassar girl laughed at nothing in particular to show her throat that it was allowed to stay open. The Jakarta athlete examined the corner of her nail and then shook out her arms as if the track had to be told that those arms were coming.\n\nOn the way out, in that narrow corridor where sound changes shape, a small lint of something floated down from the lighting rig with the laziness of dust that believes itself to be interesting. It caught the edge of Dara\u2019s cheek and then stuck on the curve of her jaw, and for a fraction her skin crawled the old crawl, the alarm that the body has so perfected, and she put her hand up with movement that pretended to be a scratch and wiped it away as if there had never been any contact. She did not look up to see if there was anything to blame, because blame is a hobby and she was trying to give up hobbies. She walked and the corridor opened and the field opened and the lanes were white lies she was ready to believe.\n\nThe gun spoke the way it always does when the moment doesn\u2019t want to argue. The first hurdle asked only what she had already answered. The fifth, under an angle of light that made the bar look more present than it was, demanded a very small fierceness and got it. She kept fifteen because the wind had made a different promise today and her hips obeyed the course. Her arms remembered to be quiet and her face remembered to stay uninteresting. Somewhere a woman screamed a name that was not hers and somewhere else a child, convinced of his own heroism, took off on a sprint that would end in giggles before the stairs. At eight, the old dip at the shoulder visited and she didn\u2019t tell it go away; she told it hold on and go with us, because some companions are easier to keep than to fight. Nine is a place where a person can become an animal with a plan; she let her legs do the remembering they wanted to do and kept her eyes honest, not looking at the tungsten bright finish but at the place where her foot would meet the next thing. Ten was a bar like a sentence she had written a thousand times and still meant. The last forty brings an honesty you cannot buy; she found the lean without borrowing from her neck and then the line came and the line went and the lungs turned themselves inside out in a practice that would never become normal.\n\nShe did not win the final either. The Semarang woman took it in the last ten with a lean that was a whole personality trait. Dara came second, closer than she would have guessed on a night when the stadium had measured her breath like a coin it could spend. The clock was pleased with her and said so; this time there was no microscope needed. It was there, a number she wanted to write somewhere secret. She walked because walking is what you do when you have asked your blood to carry fire and it is trying to negotiate for water. She put her hands on her hips because that position had helped her breathe since she was ten and had run the length of a paddy bund to beat a storm home. She looked for the camera with Rafi on the other side of it without moving her head, the way people look for birds they don\u2019t want to spook, and she could not see him, but she could feel him telling some nurse that she kept her hips, that she had not let the picture take the lane, that she had not let weather pretend to be fate.\n\nIn the mix zone, the microphones had found larger prey and she was given the luxury of walking with only a small pack of curiosity at her heels. The sponsor appeared with the glare of a person whose shoes had not touched anything uncarpeted, his smile set to polite. He said congratulations like someone offering a napkin. He asked if she wanted to say a few words to the brand\u2019s followers, and she said a few words to the people who buy shoes with their hope and their fear, and she tried to make the words plain because plain tastes better after a race. \u201cI ran,\u201d she said. \u201cI tried to be honest.\u201d The producer, who had grown a small weather antenna that could sense when a thing was enough, cut it there, and thanked her, and told her to sit down and breathe like it was a new skill they had invented together.\n\nVina arrived out of the stream with a time that didn\u2019t owe anyone an apology, buzzing because that\u2019s what she does and also because she had caffeine shaped like candy, and she kissed Dara\u2019s forehead in a moment of theatrical tenderness that contained real salt. \u201cSecond is dangerous,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes you want more.\u201d Naya came and leaned against a wall with the grace of someone who could make rest into a strong pose and said, \u201cYou were good,\u201d and because it was Naya, it sounded like a sentence that carried six meanings. Pak Bram took his time coming over, not because he was withholding but because he liked to give the sound a chance to understand what it had just heard, and when he reached her he did nothing unusual, did not do a film gesture, did not raise a finger like a prophet; he just pressed his palm to the back of her head once, very briefly, like he had known her since she was shorter than a hurdle, and he said, \u201cLain kali,\u201d and it was not disappointment, it was appetite.\n\nThe night was a different animal entirely outside the stadium. The city steamed and flashed and forgot easily and was proud of that. In the hotel room, the girls made a mess they would clean later and shared food that tasted better because it had been paid for by someone else\u2019s money, a plum sweetness of victory without triumph. They watched replay clips that had already started making their rounds, captioned and filtered and slowed, and they made their own commentary, mean and kind in equal parts, and they were everything a team is that doesn\u2019t need to hold hands to hold a line. Dara sent Rafi a picture of her shoes with their salt maps like coastlines and he sent back a photo of his whiteboard where he had written \u201c15/15/16/16/16/16/16/16/16/17?\u201d and then drawn a smiley face with eyebrows the nurse had complimented, and under it he had written, \u201cnot a guess, an autobiography.\u201d She laughed out loud and then threw a towel at Vina for making a comment about celebrities, and then let herself fall quiet because quiet after a race is a feast.\n\nIn the morning, they had the kind of travel day that makes the body feel like an object moved by other people\u2019s schedules. The bus smelled like sweat remembered and the road insisted on being itself with a stubbornness that made conversation part stop-and-go. The coach slept with his mouth open and an expression that would become myth if someone took a picture; they did not, because they all wanted to keep their coach human. Naya leaned her head on the window and drew a finger on the glass and left nothing. Vina made videos that would later look like more fun than they were, because that\u2019s how survival edits itself. Dara watched the green smear of trees and the scramble of vendors at a toll gate and the way the sky above the edge of the city seemed to be considering a new arrangement and thought of all the ways the day had been almost a trap and then wasn\u2019t.\n\nBack in Bandung, the stadium looked shy after Jakarta, but it was the kind of shyness that comes with kindness built in. The next week was already arranging itself: a little celebration disguised as a jog, the live thing the sponsor wanted that they pretended was about community and was actually about inventory, the repeated question from reporters who arrive late and ask if fear is like a muscle and if she has advice for young athletes, the hospital visits that braid themselves between training like a constant friend, the house where the couch kept its arguments and the kitchen kept its peace, the dog at the stadium with his adopted tape, the drain that sometimes decided to sing. The day after they returned, rain took the city by the shoulders and shook it, and Dara ran in it until her shirt clung in a way that did not deserve poetry, and she let her head be a metronome for her legs, and she felt the old picture try to come in through a corner and she told it, not cruelly, that it could watch if it wanted but it could not comment.\n\nThe live stream happened under a tent that wanted to be a set. The producer had assembled a small altar of props that said running without screaming it, and a young host with dimples asked questions like he had rehearsed empathy and passed. People in chat asked about warm-up and about breakfast and about shoes and about prayer and about playlists and one person asked, \u201cAre you really scared or is it just for brand,\u201d and the host made a face that said he wanted to skip it and the producer made a face that said he wanted to measure it, and Dara said, \u201cI\u2019m scared of many things, like everyone. I run anyway.\u201d Someone typed, \u201cLike Spider-Man,\u201d and a dozen laughing faces moved up the screen like bubbles, and Dara glanced at the corner of the tent where a web had drawn a straight line between two plastic poles and found herself smiling because sometimes the city gives you a gift sideways. She did not make a joke she could have made. She let the smile be private. After the stream, a small girl in a faded school shirt came up with a pen that didn\u2019t work and eyes that did, and said, \u201cMbak, if you are scared why do you do it,\u201d and Dara said, \u201cBecause I love it more than I am scared of it,\u201d and the girl nodded as if love were a recipe and her mother said terima kasih in a voice like a blanket.\n\nRafi had a small fever the day after, the kind that makes a room smaller and numbers less polite. He slept like a person who had assigned someone else his jokes for a night, and their mother counted while pretending not to count and made tea for no reason but the teapot needed to practice, and Dara sat in the chair that had become her shape and read the same sentence four times and did not make herself feel stupid for it. A nurse new to their part of the ward came in with sharp competence and a wrist that wore three hair ties and two bracelets and a watch trying to mind all its hours, and she said the fever would go because the meds would remember what to do and because he was young and young has a way of arguing with heat, and she updated the chart like a drawing. Dara watched a tiny mite that was not a spider stroll along the edge of the bedrail and she did not give it a story; she flicked it away because it was in the wrong place and thought about how it is possible to be gentle and efficient with an enemy.\n\nAt practice, Bu Rara returned like a rumor that had decided to become a person and walked them through a simple piece of mind work that felt like a trick until it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019re going to let a thought be a car on a road,\u201d she said, \u201cand we\u2019re going to watch it drive by without trying to stop it or get in,\u201d and Vina snorted and said hers were motorbikes that do not stay in lanes and Naya said hers were angkot that stop whenever they like, and they all made fun of themselves until their laughter tired, and then they stood in the drizzle and watched their brains make embarrassing choices and refused to be embarrassed. Dara felt an old picture pull up to the curb, a small eight-legged taxi that had been honking outside for years, and she did not get in; she watched it idling and then turn a corner it always turns when ignored. The coach observed from a few meters away with the expression of a man watching modern dance and trying to decide whether it was a joke, and then he said, \u201cKalau bisa bantu, ya sudah,\u201d and pulled out his stopwatch to do the thing he knows.\n\nA local journalist came with hair like a thesis and asked if the city had been kind to her, and she said the city had been itself and that was nearly always enough, and the journalist asked about Jakarta and the sound there and the way the last ten meters feel and whether the body tells the truth, and Dara said the body sometimes lies to protect you and sometimes lies to hurt you, and your job is to catch it in the act and forgive it anyway. The piece came out the next day with a picture of her that looked like she knew her lines and the headline stole the line about weather because headlines are magpies. Vina teased her for an hour and then sent her a screenshot where a comment said, \u201cMy daughter wants to run now,\u201d and it stopped being a game for a second and became a reason.\n\nWeeks spiraled with a discipline the calendar writes when a person has decided on a part of themselves to grow. She kept the counting that had started to feel less like compulsion and more like accompaniment. She kept stepping into shoes without ceremony. She kept saying the word that had once made her skin buzz and now sometimes did nothing but measure a breath. She still jumped sometimes at a dark curl in a corner, but she did not give it all her blood. Rafi\u2019s numbers went up and down like a coastline drawn by someone who had not yet been to geography class, and he pretended to be unfazed more times than he was, and they both refused to let bravery be a law. The sponsor continued to find angles and occasionally found grace. The coach continued to be a rock with a watch and occasionally let a joke happen in front of his own mouth, which meant a lot to the ones who were paying attention. Naya qualified for something small and important and celebrated it by eating noodles with too much chili and calling it strategy. Vina posted a video of her false start that she framed as a metaphor and a warning and a comedy, and the city applauded because the city is good at applause.\n\nThe day came when Dara ran a set in practice and did not think about correction or weight or fear for three entire minutes, and it felt like flying because flying is not the absence of gravity but the agreement with it, and she thought, after, sitting on the grass with tape around her finger like a ring, that this could be a life: the lanes, the visits, the small bread things her mother puts in plastic boxes, the sponsor who will eventually find a new story, the coach who will eventually choose a new kid to bark at, the spider she will see one day in a bathroom mirror and not flinch at, the brother who will be in a room that is not this one and will say something that saves her for the afternoon. She thought of the hurdle she hit and the bruise that had bloomed and the word she learned to say without summoning and the rhythm that lives at calf and shin and hinge, and she let herself want the next race without apology.\n\nWhen the sun decided to go down that evening it did it like a good exit, quickly, a bow and a soft step. The neighborhood filled with the kind of music you don\u2019t plan and the kind of cooking you don\u2019t measure, and she sat on her bed and wrote nothing and read nothing and closed her eyes and saw the ten bars in a row like teeth and did not feel afraid. She messaged Rafi a picture of the dog with the tape and he wrote, \u201cHe knows how to run with his fear,\u201d and she wrote, \u201cHe knows how to chew it,\u201d and he wrote, \u201cSame,\u201d and even the machine in his room made a sound that could be interpreted as a laugh if you wanted to be generous. She was generous. She lay back. The ceiling stayed stubbornly itself. The night belonged to anyone who could hold it for a second, and for once, and then again, she could.",

The hills above Dago sent down a breeze that had learned to speak to sweat politely, and the stadium, smaller than the one that had held her in its mouth last week, looked relieved to be only itself. Pak Bram called hills because sometimes you have to ask the legs to argue with gravity in a different dialect, and they went out the back gate in twos and threes to the steep little road that curled like a question behind the university. The asphalt there was patched with tar that had cooled in shiny kidney shapes, and the angkot brakes barked like small mean dogs as they inched their way down, and the vendors were only just arranging their sopi-sopi, those temporary tables that hold breakfast like it is a fragile porcelain.\n\nShe ran the repeats with the efficiency of someone who wanted this to be done and wanted it to do something to her. Hills do not give you glamour, but they carve a kind of nobility into your calves if you let them. Naya matched her for the first four and then fell back with a grin that said she was doing math in a way that would pay her body interest later. Vina turned each ascent into a performance, knees higher, arms theatrical, talking between sets to an imaginary camera because the real one would arrive this afternoon and she liked to keep her dialogue warm. On the last rep, midway up where the slope kicked like a mule with timing, Dara felt her breath clutch and tried not to make a bargain with it. She let the step be just a step. She kept her hips forward. She let the road rise and she met it.\n\nBack at the field, a small tent with a logo had sprouted near the bleachers, the sponsor\u2019s colony marking. A man with shoes that did not trust the ground sipped coffee from a paper cup and looked at them like a farmer appraising a crop. The producer from the warehouse smiled with continuity, as if this morning were still part of that script. She waved at Dara, a wave that said welcome and also said we have chores. They waited until the last of the cool-down jog had sobered the team, and then the producer clapped her hands as if birds might land. \u201cWe loved last week,\u201d she said, efficient brightness in each syllable. \u201cThe comments were so engaged. The brand feels there is an opportunity to speak to youth about resilience. We\u2019re proposing\u2014\u201d she gestured, and the man in the formal shoes swiped to a new image on his tablet, an athlete mid-air, bars stylized into geometric shapes like art had met athletics and they had agreed to sit near each other.\n\nThe next slide was a sketch she did not like. A net, thin and elegant, stretched behind an athlete, and the tagline in English, because English implied sophistication to someone in an office: Run Through What Catches You. A smaller line beneath, in Bahasa, playful: Tembus Takut. The sketch was good, actually, clean lines and the white space used with taste. The problem was the deliciousness with which the idea treated her nerves.\n\n\u201cNo nets,\u201d Dara said, not unkindly. She kept her tone like a lane: blunt and marked.\n\nThe producer\u2019s brightness didn\u2019t dim, it re-angled. \u201cOf course, we hear you. The concept is metaphorical.\u201d\n\n\u201cMetaphors have bodies,\u201d Dara said. She felt her skin collect, a tightness under the clavicle that she knew how to measure now. \u201cWe can talk resilience. Not the web. Not the net.\u201d\n\nThe man with the shoes cleared his throat into a smile. \u201cWe can revise visuals. Core message is powerful.\u201d\n\nPak Bram watched the exchange with the expression of a man who had decided to let his runner test her start alone. He lifted one eyebrow in a way that said choose your fights and nodded when she did. Naya stepped closer, a quiet flanking move. \u201cMaybe rhythm,\u201d she said into the gentle space. \u201cStability. Keep step,\u201d and the producer, who liked a good pivot when it arrived dressed, brightened genuinely.\n\n\u201cYes! Rhythm. Count. We can do something with meter, heartbeat, your step count,\u201d she said, fingers dancing a new shape in the air. \u201cLess scary. More\u2026 method.\u201d She made the word sound like a couture label.\n\nThey let the new idea live long enough to grow a sketch right there, the tablet filling with lines and arrows, and the man\u2019s shoe finally trusting the ground enough to scuff a little. The producer glanced at Dara and did a small bow with her head that acknowledged both a battlefield avoided and a path chosen. Bad compromises rot, good ones can feed you.\n\nAt the hospital later, the air in the ward had that particular calm that announces the hour when even machines try to lower their voices. Rafi was propped with a magazine he had no intention of reading and a bandage that made his arm look like a prop from a play. The fever had receded as predicted, leaving fatigue like a tide line. He smiled when she walked in with a container of kue lapis, the colors stacked like optimism.\n\n\u201cMy athlete,\u201d he said in a voice that had borrowed sandpaper but was still his.\n\n\u201cMy patient,\u201d she said, placing the sweets where food would decide their schedule, not them. \u201cThey want to wrap me in metaphors.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease tell me you said you would only wear similes,\u201d he said, and then winced because the laugh he wanted would cost him. She sat and told him about the pitch and the net and the pivot to rhythm, and he nodded, pleased like an old coach who approved of a training macrocycle he wouldn\u2019t have designed himself. \u201cThere\u2019s music in it,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople like seeing you count what they can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe looked at his hand, at the finger where a nail had fallen off and was growing back stubborn and ugly the way healing sometimes is, and she thought about counting that was not steps. \u201cYou want garden?\u201d she asked after a beat. He had gotten three days of good numbers in a row. Sometimes you ask for the treat only when you are almost sure you will not be refused.\n\nHe wanted garden. The nurse with the three hair ties and the watch that worked hard signed them out like passengers on a short ferry and warned them about wind because wind on a roof is a different animal from wind on a street. The garden had learned them by now; it arranged its light so the bench they liked was not wet, it held the jasmine\u2019s smell back a little because it was new and could be rude, it presented a spider web without its owner strung between a low branch and a railing like lace that had chosen sobriety. Rafi tipped his head to it like to an elder. Dara watched the way the dew had beaded along the threads, each drop with its own idea of gravity. She did not step around it more than she needed. She did not report the sighting to any alarm inside. They sat and talked about what noodles to eat in two weeks if the numbers behaved a bit longer, and they talked about the boy in the next bed who had a voice like a radio and told stories into the night, and they talked about whether the city had more green left in it than people said, and they let the wind be the third voice in their conversation.\n\nTraining changed shape the way a song slows when you reach the bridge. The speed remained but the emphasis moved. They worked drills that had the brain listening for rhythm even when breath tried to distract it. Bu Rara had them mark out strides with chalk on the track, faded dots that their feet learned like a child's string game. Dara found that when she was watching for her count she had less space for other pictures and felt a fury at the simplicity that made her say, later, to Naya, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t anyone tell me to look at the dots earlier,\u201d and Naya said, \u201cThey did, in different ways. You needed it to look like chalk.\u201d Vina mocked the dots until she stumbled her own count and then she fell in love with them in a day and put \u201cdots are my guide\u201d on a story that would make it to someone\u2019s for you page who needed it.\n\nIn the locker room one Thursday, there was an actual creature again. This time it wasn\u2019t a jump-scare thrown by fate. It was small, brown, not a myth, near the drain under the bench. The younger girls squealed because they were allowed to and then moved back too far because they thought they weren\u2019t. Dara felt the old elevator drop in her chest, the hitch that used to spoil entire mornings. She stood there, the bag half open, the towel already smelling like a thousand showers, and watched the animal move, quick and certain in its own axis. She heard herself breathe. She did not look for anybody to rescue her from a thing she hated. She took the plastic container that held her hair ties, emptied three elastics into her pocket, and squatted the way her coach hated because he said that posture had a way of making knees into arguments. She slid the container slowly until it was a room over the spider. She felt the thread of disgust hum along her forearms like a warning wire. She held steady, slid the lid with awkward kindness and felt it click. Her heart allowed itself one ridiculous flourish and then retook its seat. The girls watched like she had performed a trick; Vina had been in the doorway and clapped once, impertinent and approving. Dara carried the container outside and tipped it into the grass with a motion that betrayed the tiny tremor she still had, and the spider, unafraid of her as it had always been, decided its own direction and went. She walked back in and forced herself not to pant like a hero.\n\nLater, in the set, her body answered her with a steadiness that felt like interest paid on a long debt. Count, lift, place, cut the air where it wants to hold you. She stumbled once at five because habits do not go to the grave without a fight, and she smiled into the mistake like a person who finally recognizes their mischievous cousin.\n\nThe sponsor came back with the rhythm concept solid enough to touch. They had lines cut into vinyl that they laid on the track for a staged shoot after practice on a Sunday when the sky had decided to bless the city with a bright that did not sting. The lines looked like music made into a path, white ticks a cadence. They asked her to run and then to walk and then to stop and talk, the camera close enough that she could count the pores of the lens itself. \u201cTell us what you hear when you run,\u201d the host asked with those dimples bestowing comfort, and she said the names of small sounds she had never bothered to name before: the whisper of a sock sliding up the back of a heel where the tape ends, the click when spike meets bar by accident, the way breath fills the space inside a mask you pretend isn\u2019t there on polluted days, the way Naya\u2019s laugh sounded like a permission that had finally been granted, the way the coach\u2019s whistle could be a prayer or a curse depending on how it entered your chest. The comments later would call it poetry; to her it was inventory.\n\nAt home, her stepfather had tools out on the floor like an altar to metal. He had taken apart a small fan and was cleaning out the dust that had the color of many months piled. He nodded at her, and she nodded back because in their new language nods were paragraphs. \u201cI made something,\u201d he said finally, in a way that suggested he would accept mild mockery as a tax. He led her outside to the small yard crowded with pots that had slid from her mother\u2019s ambition to grow greens to a pragmatic acceptance of what would live; he had welded two old bicycle frames and a length of pipe into a makeshift hurdle, the top bar fashioned from a smooth slat of wood he had planed himself. It was heavier than regulation, and ugly in a way that made it handsome. \u201cFor latihan di rumah,\u201d he said, like he had purchased a small satellite and parked it near the potted chili.\n\nShe laughed with her whole face and with a soft ache in the throat. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 perfect,\u201d she said, and meant it. He looked relieved in a way she had never seen, as if he had been holding a plank with his teeth and could set it down. He said he had watched a video of her doing drills and had decided he could make a thing she could argue with at home. \u201cYou stand here,\u201d he demonstrated badly, knees creaking, and she loved him a little worse for pretending his body had forgotten the flood. He looked at the drain near the back step and then away and then back. \u201cI closed this,\u201d he said, as if anticipating a rebuke that did not come. \u201cOnly when hujan besar.\u201d She said okay because it was okay.\n\nThe gotong royong spirit, that village muscle city life tries to forget, pulled its weight the following week when storm water laughed at the stadium\u2019s drains. The far corner turned into a mirror, and the frog came back with cousins. The coach threw his hands in the air and then used them to set cones in the gym. They did plyometrics inside where the shouting of boys playing futsal next door made everything feel like a market. Her stepfather appeared at the edge of the field wearing his work shirt and a stubbornness, carrying a snake of coiled hose and a length of rebar like he had made a date with the concept of flow. He and two other men who had been boys here once and then went away and then came back got into the drain with the easy heroism of people who do not ask to be photographed while shoulder-deep in the old city\u2019s secrets. He looked up once at Dara, face shining with rain and effort, and did that nod they had taught themselves. She did the nod back that contained gratitude without a speech.\n\nWhen the water receded with a sulk, they went back out and ran curved runs on lanes five and six to avoid the silt smear on the inside. Naya made a joke about a new event, 380 meters with mud hazard, and Vina pretended to slip for the camera and then slipped for real and fell on her pride more than her ass and laughed because she would rather be known for laughing than for sulking. Dara felt the familiar urge to scan the edges of the lane and practiced the thing Bu Rara had given them: she allowed the scan and then let it be a car on the road, going by, not stopping. She counted. She let the drumbeat be a drumbeat, not a warning. She let herself run until the part of her that had wanted to be dramatic lay down and took a nap.\n\nNational Trials announced themselves in an email that wore a logo and expectation. The field would be deeper, the time standards printed in black like a dare. Jakarta would be hotter, the noise larger, the consequences more expensive. The sponsor sent a careful message asking if they could shoot something in the week before, \u201cpre-race rituals, simple moments,\u201d and the producer promised no props, no nets, no cleverness, just a lens catching hands tying laces and faces deciding. Dara agreed because sometimes saying yes to small things keeps bigger wolves from the door. The brand\u2019s assistant sent a list of questions that included one about fear she left unanswered, and the assistant, a woman who knew how to read silence and did it kindly, did not push.\n\nRafi had a good week and then a bad afternoon and then a regular day. The hospital had learned to make rollercoasters look like sidewalks. He clowned at a new intern and hit on a volunteer with a nerve that was polite and commented on how her eyeliner was a work of engineering, and then he winced at a pain spiking where sap doesn\u2019t run and swallowed it without being noble. He asked her to bring noodles and then decided the smell made him want to set the world on fire, and she laughed because these were preferences and preferences meant he was not in the part of the story where everything is just endurance. She brought him a small plastic spider from a kid\u2019s toy shop, black and shiny and stupid, and he put it on his IV pole and announced it his mascot, and the nurses groaned and named it Ujang and assigned it a bed number as a joke. He made her take a picture of Ujang supervising his infusion and posted it on a private account with five friends and three cousins, and one of the cousins who used to be a terror wrote, \u201cRespect Ujang,\u201d and it was a silly thing that managed to make the room lighter.\n\nIn the one quiet evening before travel, she went to the small mosque at the end of the alley because the call had sounded like a friend. She did not know what to ask beyond the usual and a new thing that had no name. She found she did not need to ask, only to stand and bow and stand again and make her breath obey a pace that had nothing to do with meter marks and everything to do with living through a day. Back home, her mother was already boiling water to fill a thermos for the next morning because mothers prefer to have already taken care of a future before it arrives and disappoints them. The note on the fried rice this time said simply: for after, and had a small heart drawn as if her mother felt embarrassed by art. Her stepfather oiled the hinge of the bedroom door that had squealed for three months because he had finally heard it enough times to decide it had been insulting him personally. They were a house that learned slowly and then forever.\n\nThe bus to Jakarta looked the same and did not feel the same. The team had shed the soft weight of hesitation and replaced it with a different restlessness. Naya brought a book of poems and really read it instead of using it as a prop. Vina slept under a hoodie with her mouth open by choice and an earphone in only one ear because attention is a currency she does not completely give to anyone. The coach watched the road with the concentration of a driver and the surrender of cargo. Dara watched the fields and the water that lay between them like sheets a child had left in a yard, and she thought absurdly of spider silk and dew, of the strength of something so small and how angering it is to feel admiration and disgust for the same engineering. She thought of the first time she had counted a full set and the way her heart had thanked her. She put her hand flat to the window again, the old gesture now just a habit without magic, and she said the sentence she had invented for herself, not out loud, not a spell, just a pact: you can ride, you cannot drive.\n\nAt the warm-up track, the air smelled like it had been holding its breath since the last big meet and was trying to catch up. The call room did its holy hush act. She went through drills with a calm that surprised her because she had expected to perform her calm and found she had some in stock. The coach said nothing unusual and thus blessed her. The lane number was different this time; the heat draw likes to remind athletes that nothing belongs to them. She pinned the bib with only two stabs to the finger. The volunteer smiled with a kindness that could only have been taught by a grandmother. Everything wanted to be an omen and she let nothing be.\n\nThe gun made the sound it makes when you agree to live inside it for a minute. She took the four, took the one, felt three ask for a story and refused, decided early on five to keep the fifteen longer than she had in training because the air had decided not to argue today, and then did the switch where it belonged with less drama than last time. The bar at seven was the bar at seven; she did not make it into her childhood. Eight was where her shoulder knocked with its old rhythm and she held it without scolding. Nine tried to turn itself into a cliff and she made it a curb. Ten was the truth she knew how to tell and she told it. The line took her under its lip and then she was through, and the number told her she had been exact enough to be dangerous to herself.\n\nShe won her heat without being the fastest person in the stadium, which is a magic that happens only when you don't demand it. The clock kissed her with a number that would make a coach\u2019s mouth tighten in pleasure. In the final, the day made her run harder than she had run in practice and exactly as hard as she had known she would need to and a hair harder anyway. She did not win the event. The winner had a kick like a lie you want to believe. She came second again, this time with a time that did not apologize for existing. The noise held her as if it had been paid and she had given a good receipt. It was not a miracle; she does not believe in those. It was something else: a day she had earned.\n\nBack at the hotel, her legs ached in coherent sentences. She lay on the carpet and let them talk. Vina spun in the desk chair and filmed them all without warning and posted without malice. Naya applied ice with the malice of a medic and refused to let anyone be dramatic about it. The coach looked like a man who had finally let his shoulders drop in a room where no one would photograph him doing it. The sponsor\u2019s assistant brought fruit plates that had been arranged by someone with a certificate and apologized for the lack of mangosteen as if it were her fault and then took a call from her boss and spoke about \u201cauthenticity\u201d without flinching. The producer gave Dara a look from across the room that said thank you for protecting your line. They were all in a life together that did not ask them to declare exactly how much they cared.\n\nOn the way back to Bandung, the air over the road had that post-rain gleam that makes everything look like it has been washed and then put back crooked. The bus had a rattle near the door that they had all agreed not to hear. Dara dozed and woke and dozed and woke, and in the second waking she looked up to find that the seat across the aisle held a small actual spider, one leg missing, making a ridiculous journey on the upholstery. It was tiny enough to be forgiven by anyone who was not her, and she watched it and felt the tug and the slide, the old metal in the mouth followed by the new breath that paid it down. She did not panic. She did not call for a killing. She did not name it. She watched it reach the seam, decide, and turn the long way around, sensible for once, and she thought, I am not required to make this a lesson, and she closed her eyes because sleep is a tool she had refused for too long and now she would use it.\n\nWhen she got to the stadium the next morning\u2014because you go to the stadium after everything, that is the law of this particular religion\u2014the dog was there with his tape, ruined now, just a ribbon, and he had decided it no longer needed parenting and had left it under the bleachers after all that labor. She picked up the tape and tied it to the fence where the breeze could play with it without turning it into trash, and she ran her warm-up in a way that made the past a companion that knew when to shut up. The brain had lied, the body had learned, and both of them, for once, inclined their heads to the day and let it be ordinary, and that, she thought as her foot found its place in the rhythm of a hundred small decisions, was a victory that might outlast medals.",

                              "content": "The next week arranged itself into a pattern that looked like a life instead of an accident. Monday belonged to starts and the annoying honesty of film; you think you are lifting, you see on a screen that your hips have opinions. Tuesday went to strength the way a day belongs to a saw: up, down, clean lines if you respect the wood. Wednesday gave them hills again until calves felt carved. Thursday was the day Pak Bram had decided they would clean, which meant he arrived with a broom instead of a speech and told them to be athletes who deserved a place that wasn\u2019t tired of them. The younger boys groaned like he had asked them to donate a kidney; the girls made it into gossip. They dragged a shallow bin along the inside of the bleachers and found the city\u2019s confessions: empty cups, a sock without a sibling, a half-dead fan, a photograph of a face smiling at someone who had removed themselves from the picture. Near the corner where the drain liked to complain, a web held a dust\u2019s version of harvest, grey and polite and empty. Dara looked and did not translate it into a threat. She was bored by her own old habit for a second, and the boredom lightened her limbs like a practical prayer.\n\nUnder the third step of the south bleacher, where the stadium stored decades of elbow grease, someone found a cluster of egg sacs, pearls if pearls could also be nightmares. The discovery made the volume of the morning jump; one of the boys lifted his phone and filmed a groan, Vina leaned in then leaned back with the drama she earns, and a cleaner who had been here longer than their coach said calmly that this was every rainy season, with a wide shrug that could hold ten tiny kingdoms and still have space. Dara felt the orchestra in her chest tune up, the old instruments finding notes without being asked. She said the word in her mouth the way she would say \u201csixteen\u201d before a switch. She took off her training jacket, laid it on the concrete to make a line between the world and her knees, and slid a tray under the step like she had learned to slide lids. The cleaner looked at her with the measured approval older women allot like gold coins. They lifted the step with three hands, slid the sacs into the tray with a paint scraper as gentle as guilt, and carried them to the far end past the fence where the grass was too brave and the lizards made their empires and let the tray be a raft. Someone made a joke about mothers. Someone else made a joke about omens. Dara\u2019s hands shook afterward in that small internal way that leaves no evidence on the surface, and her breathing was ragged, but she was standing, and the ground was just ground. She took the broom again and went back to persuading dust to forgive them for months of stomping.\n\nThe sponsor\u2019s tent that had sprouted near the bleachers felt less like a colony that day and more like a neighbor who had brought sugar and gossip. They had asked her to visit a school that sat two streets over and one generation under, and she said yes because the street was their street and she had run past that fence enough times to owe it something. The producer balanced a cake box on her palm and made jokes about bribing attention, and the man who liked his shoes clean tried to adopt a slouch for the alley that did not fit him at all.\n\nThe school had the smell that all schools share and no one has managed to bottle: warm paper, ink, resolved arguments, rubber soles, the faint stubbornness of chalk. The badminton court in the yard had surrendered lines to bare feet long ago. They put her on a chair in front and the principal made a speech with three jokes the students had obviously heard before, laughing in the right places like a choir executing a well-practiced harmony. Dara told them about the lane and how it was a friend if you let it be boring, she told them about the hurdle and how it stopped being a wall when you taught your body the steps like a nursery rhyme, and she told them a little about fear without saying fear, because she was not there to make drama a subject. She showed them how to count fifteen with the body. A boy in the third row asked if running made her rich in a tone that contained no malice, only economics. She said running made her tired and then satisfied and sometimes gave her bus tickets; wealth was a thing she would not pretend to explain until someone paid her to do it.\n\nAfter the questions, when pictures had been taken in groups that made no sense and every phone had captured a version of her eyes looking somewhere else, a small boy tugged her sleeve and said he had something to show her and could he show her outside where it was brighter. He had a jar with holes poked in the lid and a creature inside that had decided it would look best if it did not move. The boy said his name was Ari with the self-importance of a person who had named himself a thousand times in games. He tipped the jar like it contained a treasure and not a trigger. It was a jumper, small, black, with a ridiculous arrogance that only something that size can afford, its front legs held like knives, its body a tight punctuation. The jar smelled like leaves and boy hands.\n\nDara felt the old elevator drop again and then stop halfway between floors because control had remembered its job. She crouched until she was at Ari\u2019s face, and in the crouch she felt the echo of a coach\u2019s scold and ignored it. She asked Ari if he had caught it in the classroom, because that would have been a story; he said on the fence, and he said it ate mosquitoes and it was his pet until recess ended. He said, with the solemnity of children who\u2019ve read a thing and now own it, that spiders are not insects, and she smiled because pedantry in the right hand can be a balloon. The producer pretended to look away and actually looked because this kind of thing is gold with marketing glaze. Dara looked at the jar and did not look away, not even once, and she felt the buzzing at the back of her mouth settle, not into comfort, but into an argument that did not require shouting. She told Ari that he was not wrong, that the tiny hunter was doing a job inside the world she had not asked to be born into, and then she asked him if he could return it to work. They walked to the hedge by the wall and unscrewed the lid together and tipped the jar and the little animal did not jump onto her, did not attack, did not reenact her story; it went onto the leaf, because the leaf was the right thing. The boy went back to class carrying nothing and feeling bigger. The producer, to her credit, did not dangle the moment in front of a lens. The brand\u2019s assistant handed Ari a sticker like a medal and made no speech. Sometimes people know how to behave.\n\nThe day dropped its middle on the ward with the abruptness it reserves for hospitals. Rafi had woken with a number that took the floor out of their mother\u2019s knees, and he had spent the morning wearing a stubborn heat that blushed his cheeks like a slap. The nurses flowed around him with competence that could calm a train, and the doctor used a voice he saves for days when he cannot fix anything immediately but can still fix his tone. Sepsis is an ugly word that pretends to be Latin for drama. It is just a door you do not want to walk through. They flooded him through a line that had learned his vein\u2019s name by now, and their mother counted the drops without looking like she was doing arithmetic, and the ward hushed the way wards hush when there is emergency but not panic. Dara sat on the chair that had accepted her shape and texted the coach that she would not be at the second session, not later and not in an hour and not if she ran from here to the track in slippers. She did not add apology. She did not add explanation beyond the obvious. You have to let people fill in their own blanks sometimes.\n\nHe replied with a thumb that could be read three ways and a sentence that had the humility he uses like a muscle. He said to stay where she was; he said they would run again tomorrow; he said the wind would still be there. She put the phone away because the room needed fewer screens. Rafi burned and then wavered and then came back down as if recovery were a polite descent. He coughed once and apologized for the volume like a man pulling his weight at his own funeral and she smacked his arm lightly because he didn\u2019t get to joke about that part. In the late afternoon, when the ward had decided it could do regular life again, the coach appeared at the door with that expression he gives when he has something in his hand that embarrasses him. It was a bottle of isotonic drink and a bag of sliced fruit that had been wrapped in plastic so tight it looked like it had been vacuum-sealed for space. He placed it on the bedside cabinet as if crossing a finish line and looked everywhere except at Rafi\u2019s tubes. He told Rafi to get better like it was a drill and told him his sister was irritating when she didn\u2019t have anyone to outrun. Rafi thanked him like a man being introduced to a neighbor\u2019s dog for the second time.\n\nAn hour later, in the corridor, the coach confessed, in the dry way he has when a sentence costs him what he thinks is pride and is actually just an old habit, that he had once watched a teammate have a seizure on the infield, the way a body insists on its own electricity and everyone else looks at the sky because they want to ask for a refund. \u201cSince then,\u201d he said, scratching the back of his neck with a thumb as if the words had come out the wrong door, \u201cI don\u2019t like any of you doing drama on the ground. Keep it standing. If fall, fall in line. You understand.\u201d He looked like he had admitted to owning a small, foolish pet that he also loved. She said she understood without making it bigger than it was. Behind him, down the corridor, her stepfather appeared with a plastic bag that had been bought to replace the previous plastic bag and held the same food because routine is medicine you can afford. The two men nodded to each other with that wary respect men reserve for one another when they cannot measure who is more necessary to the girl between them. The coach left with his watch set to comfort. Her stepfather took his place in the chair and made a joke about Ujang, the mascot spider, asking for visitation rights.\n\nThe call about camp arrived while she and Naya were tying the elastic bands that make a person\u2019s hips honest. National training would be held at Ragunan for six weeks. There would be two coaches who had not learned their names yet, a physio who would, and an official who would count everything and then count it again as if this time numbers might decide to be kinder. The group chat lit with blistering optimism, then settled into logistics like a cooking show: who would water the plant in Vina\u2019s room that she insists is a basil and is actually a pothos, who could feed the lanky cat that lived behind the long jump sand and had had kittens on their day off, who could be trusted to tell the sponsor that no, they would not do a live from weights. Dara read the message twice and kept her face smooth. Rafi stuck a thumb up from his pillow that carried a cannula. He said go before she asked. He said if she did not, he would make her tie him to his IV pole and drag him to training, which would be embarrassing for everyone because he would be the slowest thing on the track. She did a bad bow from the waist while sitting and he laughed with his eyes and then with his chest when it stopped hurting.\n\nThat night, at home, her mother folded clothes that had nothing to do with training with a care that would put a laundry detergent advertisement to shame. She put socks together that had long ago chosen to divorce and, through sheer maternal stubbornness, forced a reconciliation. She wrote a note on a piece of paper that had been used for a list of prices on one side and a prayer on the other and tucked it into the side of the bag where the tape lives. Dara would not see the note until the fourth day in camp, when she would need it. Her stepfather stood in the door with his arms crossed because he had nothing to do with packing except wanting and not knowing where to put it. He said he\u2019d go to the hospital on Wednesdays and Saturdays when she couldn\u2019t, and he said it in a voice that pretended it was a suggestion and wasn\u2019t. She said thank you and meant it in a way that wrapped old and new recognition around his name. Later, he tested the hinge he had oiled and smiled at it as if it had thanked him.\n\nThe national dorms had beds that pretended to be stern and rooms that smelled like fifteen years of dreams and anti-mold packets. The communal bathrooms had tiles that had been chosen by someone who resented color. Her roommate was a hurdler from Manado named Lia who wore her hair in a bun that made her look like she never left business to accident. Lia had a way of speaking that made bad news sound like an invitation to dance and good news sound like an assignment. On the first night, Lia took her to the bathroom on their floor like she was introducing a new friend to an old friend and said if the water is cold, hit it, and if the light flickers, talk to it. On the second morning, around five, the flicker was the least of it. There was a spider the size of an old coin on the shower wall, tuley brown, slow, deliberate, obviously not interested in girls with soap. Lia said \u201chai\u201d to it like you say to an aunt you haven\u2019t decided to love yet. Dara felt the usual involuntary poem start in her chest and then interrupt itself. She took the plastic bowl they used to pour water on their heads and pressed it to the tile with a care that surprised her and slid it down until bowl met floor. \u201cYou okay?\u201d Lia asked, half ready with a giggle, half with genuine care. Dara breathed two times and took the flat, cheap sandal she hated and slid it under the bowl as a lid, then took the whole construction outside to the corridor and tipped. The spider made a decision and took the corner toward the stairs. Lia made a sound that was ninety percent delight and ten percent \u201cew.\u201d Later, in the dining hall, she told three girls at breakfast that her roommate was ridiculous and brave and Dara did not correct the order.\n\nThe camp introduced her to Sari with the formal informality of athletes who have already met across lanes. Sari had been the woman from Semarang leaning into the finish like a thesis. Up close, she was someone you would trust to hold your wallet and beat you to the last seat on the bus; these things, in a good person, coexist. They ran side by side as if the track had been waiting for the two of them to pack each other\u2019s lunches. They sorted out their rivalry without words, in the way strides stretch, in the way breaths match and then diverge. Sari asked in the gym if it was true about fear and a sponsor and a net, and Dara rolled her eyes and said a brand tried to embroider her nerves and she had told them to bring thread for her calves instead. Sari grinned like approval is a sport. They shared a physio who had hands like a clockmaker and a habit of humming 90s love songs while scraping out the nonsense that lives in a hamstring. They avoided the national official who had decided it was his job to teach them how to smile like medals. They learned the cafeteria\u2019s bad days and the good seat where the AC did not aim at the back of your neck like a gossip.\n\nOn the third week, her phone vibrated with a message from her mother that held only the word \u201cbisa\u201d and then a list of times. She called the ward from under a shade tree that was trying to decide whether it was a therapeutic presence or a shelter for smokers. The doctor said \u201celigible\u201d like a word had been allowed to put its shoes on. A donor match had been found for Rafi, not perfect, but a near enough sister to the blood that the body might be persuaded to accept it; there would be a window, logistics were commotion, the hospital would be a choreography of white coats and moving parts and permissions. Transplant was a word Dara had previously met only in late-night articles and other families\u2019 stories; now it stood in her living room.\n\nShe walked the perimeter of the little field behind the dorm where damp collects and small frogs try their luck. She counted for no reason except to remind herself that numbers could be domesticated; one breath, two, three, like chalk dots underfoot without the chalk. She told herself to stay until there was a reason to go. She called the coach, her coach, not the national one who barely knew her name and liked to say \u201cyou people\u201d as if that were efficient, and she told him the news, half expecting the sound of a whistle inside his throat. He said \u201cgood\u201d like he meant it, then he said \u201cgulp the training,\u201d and she understood he meant do not break your shape with worry. He said if a day arrives that needs you, the track will wait. She cried in a way that would be invisible to anyone who was not holding her face at the time. Then she wiped it with the back of her hand like a kid who has had practice.\n\nThere was a day when a rumor tried to take the lane. Someone online, with a username that sounded like a name and a face that refused to be a face, wrote that fear was a marketing tool and that she had made spiders into a product to sell shoes. It would have made her eyes hot a month ago. As it was, she threw her phone toward the bed and missed and retrieved it and then sent the link to Vina with the note \u201cCome collect your people.\u201d Vina screenshotted the ridiculousness and posted it with a caption that made a joke out of how little content creators needed to eat, and then she called, which surprised Dara because this is not usually what Vina does. She said, in a voice that had put its lipstick away, that people on the internet are a fog and you do not make turns based on fog. She said also, awkward like a shoe on the wrong foot, that she had been jealous of the attention and had said one and a half mean things that were hers and not the fog\u2019s, and she apologized by calling herself a clown twice, which was her version of kneeling. Dara accepted, heartily, and then made fun of her for not knowing what pothos is. They were silly on the phone for long enough that the rumor was forced to look for a new shape to sit in.\n\nThe national coach, a man with a jaw like a stapler, ran them on the grass in diagonals and made them run again when the diagonals were not straight enough for his eyes. He used words like \u201cmovement quality\u201d and \u201cinhibition,\u201d and when someone groaned, he said he would inhibit their breakfast. They learned, in the way girls who run learn quicker than anyone thinks, that half of this game is keeping your head where you told it to be. In the dorm that night, Lia told Dara that there had been a tarantula in her aunt\u2019s house in Bitung as big as a hand and that her aunt had called it swear words and left it alone and it had left, and that bravery sometimes looks like not cleaning. Dara said she could get behind that definition. She went to brush her teeth and the bathroom was empty of drama and the mirror did not have any messages for her. She regarded her face with the curiosity of a stranger who might buy.\n\nOn the fourth day of the fourth week, the hospital asked for signatures on papers that had corners and read like small constitutions. Their mother wore her neatest clothes that were not neat and her neatest breath that was not steady, and their stepfather signed his name like someone who had taught his hand late and it still wanted to forget its letters. Rafi, who had shed much of his vanity with his hair, insisted that Ujang attend the consent conference taped to the side of the IV pole like a witness. Dara listened on video and said yes to the Yes parts and breathed through the parts that sounded like materials written to cover every hypothesis. The nurse with the three hair ties and the bracelets nodded at her through pixels like a friend telling you they would keep a seat for you at the stupid party in case you arrived late.\n\nThe night before the procedure, she sat with Naya on the low curb behind the track and they ate noodles from a packet that all runners pretend they do not eat and then confess to loving. They talked about lanes because that was safe, and then they talked about Rafi because life had asked, and Naya told a story about an aunt\u2019s operation that turned out to be less dramatic than the story had promised and how sometimes the world uses the language of catastrophe to describe a day that ends in a sandwich. Dara held the thought like a warm coin. The national coach passed them in the corridor later and said \u201clights out\u201d as if he could enforce the night, and they said \u201cyes, sir\u201d with the practiced insolence of girls who would sleeplessly count anyway.\n\nIn the morning, she ran before the sun committed, because the body knows how to pray in its own dialect. The warm-up track had a cat who had decided that the coil of a hose was its kingdom; she didn\u2019t disturb the monarchy. She did A-skips and B-skips and small hops that told her ankles the truth, and she counted fifteen with breath, not with steps, and she remembered to keep her arms quiet because noise radiates. She finished with two accelerations that made the air part in front of her as if it had a plan for her shape. Then she went back, showered, put on real clothes because hospitals notice when you arrive looking like you live there, and took the bus to the ward because she did not trust her legs not to take her to the track if she went on foot.\n\nThe ward had organized itself into a quiet that was not fake. The donor\u2019s blood, persuaded by a government database and good luck, had arrived cold and correct. Rafi joked twice without catching breath and had to stop, and then he did the serious thing people do before anesthesia by making insane faces, and then he went in. Their mother sat as if the chair was a talking thing and she was trying to hear the words. Their stepfather, who had never called any man \u201cdoctor\u201d in his life without feeling cheated, called four men in coats \u201cDoctor\u201d and meant it. Dara walked the corridor and did not think about corners. She texted the coach that she would be out of the group chat noise. He replied with an emoji that could be a fist or a potato depending on your generation. Hours do the strangest stretches in hospitals. You already know this if you\u2019ve ever watched lamplight change on tile and tried not to count because counting makes it worse.\n\nIt went. Of course it went; she would not tell this story like this from the other side if it did not. It was not miracle, again. It was science with a handshake from mercy. The doctor said what doctors say when things have done what they are supposed to do without making a scene: now we wait, now we watch, now we do not insult the body with too much celebration at the wrong time. When they rolled him out and parked him in his new reality, he looked like sleep held his weight for him. Their mother cried the kind of tears that clean you out and leave you stable; not salt, but water. The nurse with the bracelets winked at Dara like an accomplice and said \u201cgood\u201d in a tone that had known every version of \u201cbad.\u201d Ujang, foolishly taped to the pole, looked down on the proceedings with the comfort of a mascot whose work here was done and would begin again tomorrow.\n\nShe went to sleep that night back at the dorm as if she had earned the right to be unconscious. In the morning, the body insisted on its routine like a friend being gentle. Sari met her at the track and did not ask for news but kept pace easy and matched her breath so they could keep a conversation without adding words. Vina sent a video of herself saying something stupid to a camera about breakfast, and Dara laughed, and it wasn\u2019t a rebellion or a statement, it was a release valve. The national coach did not praise more because he did not know how; he barked less. Bu Rara sent a voice note that said nothing useful and somehow helped, a calm voice reminding her to count stones on a path instead of looking into bushes. Her stepfather messaged a photograph of the homemade hurdle with rain beads on it like small medals, and her mother sent a picture of a bowl of soup and wrote \u201cfor after\u201d because she wasn\u2019t going to retire a good note for one time.\n\nThe Trials were set to begin the week after the first markers of Rafi\u2019s acceptance would appear in numbers that had learned her name. The stadium in Jakarta would look no different to a new runner and entirely different to a girl who had carried a jar with a web once. She stood in the lane during the last practice before travel and watched the lines as if they might back away, then looked up because she had learned that sometimes the sky is as busy as the ground. A bird that had made the track its commute dropped a very small feather onto lane five, and it drifted with a carelessness she envied and then landed near the takeoff for three, and she did not make it significant. She counted. She ran. Then she ran again, and this time when the old tug under her shoulder arrived, she let it ride without paying it with a grimace it did not deserve. Naya shouted something unhelpful and loving. The coach\u2019s whistle cut a line in the morning and then softened. The city, that old person who watched from beyond the wall, said nothing because it did not need to. She had enough voices in her chest now that made sense.\n\nThat evening, she packed with the efficiency of a person who had repeated a life until it obeyed. She placed the tape where it belongs, the sachet in the pocket her hand knows even in the dark, the spikes wrapped in a shirt that did not deserve to smell like them. She took the note her mother had tucked and finally read it: a list of small instructions that had nothing to do with running and everything to do with being a person: drink water but not too much before gun; call after; if you see a cat, do not kick it; if you see a big person, remember they were small once; if you see a small thing that scares you, remember it does not know you. She laughed and cried and then did neither. She turned off the light and lay in the dark and did not make it a metaphor. The morning would arrive with its own feet. She would meet it where she always did: lane, line, count, breath, a body that had learned, a brain that had decided to be less creative, a family that coursed through her in as invisible a way as blood, a fear that had gotten bored with being the main character and learned to play a supporting role. She slept, and her sleep made no promises beyond the polite ones. The city filled the rest.",

                              "content": "The week folded itself around departures as if travel were a person who had to be accommodated. In the dorm, Lia narrated the packing like a sportscaster because it calmed her nerves and entertained whoever walked by their door: tape in first because ankles have seniority, spikes wrapped in the shirt you hate because they will punish it with their smell, toiletries in a pouch that pretends order is possible for small bottles, the lucky hair tie even if you don\u2019t believe in luck. Dara let herself move slower than the clock demanded, not as a rebellion but because slowness is its own strategy when the head wants to sprint ahead and check every corner for a trap. Her phone lay face down on the bed like a guest who had fallen asleep on the sofa, and when she flipped it, the messages were a small street fair: the sponsor\u2019s assistant reminding her of a polite appearance after heats, the coach\u2019s \u201cingat makan,\u201d her mother\u2019s three shades of prayer disguised as instructions to wear socks at night so her calves wouldn\u2019t \u201cmasuk angin,\u201d and a video from the ward where Ujang had been ceremonially retired from the IV pole with a tiny paper \u201cterima kasih\u201d sign taped beside him. The nurse with the bracelets said, off-camera and with a wink that translated across pixels, that mascots need rest too, and Rafi, in a voice that had borrowed steadiness again, declared that Ujang had been promoted to head of risk management and would now live on top of the TV where dust goes to die.\n\nThe bus down to Jakarta carried the same smells and complaints and astonishments it always did, the rhythm of a body of people trying to arrange themselves into comfort on upholstery never designed for it. Sari sat across the aisle with her knees pulled up and her eyes closed, mouth pulled into a line that could be focus or fatigue, and Naya leaned into the window\u2019s light and turned a poem book face down on her lap like the page needed to breathe. Vina filmed the back of everyone\u2019s head and provided commentary in a whisper that resisted its own impulse to be loud, catching the coach at one point tilting his cap down over his eyes in a gesture that could be interpreted as a nap or a treaty. The road unfurled in its usual patchwork of crops and concrete, and in a field just before Karawang a thin row of banana plants stood like a sketch, their leaves torn by wind into long fingers that had given up pretending to be whole, and Dara let herself look without composing a defense, the image entering and departing like a busker\u2019s song you enjoy without tipping because you have to conserve coins for later.\n\nRagunan felt different when you arrived with the knowledge of leaving soon. The dorm\u2019s corridor offered the same smell of disinfectant and ambition, but it was less heavy, like an unresolved chord that would resolve within days. The national coach watched them arrival-jog around the grass with his arms crossed and his jaw doing its usual impression of a tool, and his assistant\u2014a woman younger than all their knees\u2014took attendance the way a cashier counts exact change, head down, eyes counting more than names. They loosened with drills that made a person feel ridiculous until the ridiculousness worked, knees up like a puppet, hips forward like a show-off, arms disciplined like a child in a fancy restaurant. Bu Rara found them where shadows gathered in a neat line and asked for five minutes without the stopwatches, which made the national coach perform indignation and then shrug because even he knew he wasn\u2019t the only god here. She gave them a little script: pick three things you will notice in the call room that have nothing to do with you, pick one thing on the track that will anchor you if your head starts becoming a liar, pick one sentence you will say to yourself only once. Dara wrote on her own mind with the new chalk: scuff marks in chair three, the pattern on a volunteer\u2019s lanyard, the number of knots in the mesh over the window, the way the eight takeoff marks look when you walk in lane five, the sentence that was not lyrical and had the decency to be plain\u2014keep hips, count, breathe.\n\nAt the hospital, the news had learned how to walk instead of run. The doctor made a shape with his hands that looked like a cup half full of water and said numbers in a tone that had been trained to translate caution into optimism without breaking either. Engraftment had begun like a neighbor knocking lightly at the door then deciding to let themselves in after all. Their mother slept in half-hour pieces and cried in bathrooms only she allowed to know that, and their stepfather patrolled the perimeter of the ward like a security guard who would gladly be demoted if someone else would take the shift; when the nurse scolded him for touching a button he was not supposed to touch, he grinned his apology in a way that announced that he would do it again if he believed the machine was asking for help. Rafi texted \u201cgo run\u201d with a frog emoji and a lightning bolt and then added \u201cdon\u2019t think, only do,\u201d which made Dara type a paragraph about the impossibility of thinking not thinking and then delete it because he was trying to give her a button she could push that wouldn\u2019t set off an alarm.\n\nThe call room on the first day of heats held the same hush that always made her grin internally, because hush in sports is never real, it is only vacationing noise. The volunteer with the lanyard had chosen a pattern of tiny foxes, and Dara counted them in her head for a few seconds and let it mean nothing. The chair three scuff mark had a particular crescent bite out of it, and she decided some sprinter had been nervous enough to dig heel into plastic and had then made a time he would remember for the rest of his useful mind because people like that deserve happy endings in your imagination if you are going to borrow their mark. Sari sat two chairs away and rolled her shoulders with the fatalism of a person opening a door to a room she had renovated herself. A woman from Balikpapan, compact and coiled, blew air out of her cheeks with a soft \u201cpuh\u201d that did the work of a joke without stealing any breath. When they were called, the numbers fell into mouthes and lived there briefly, then turned to lanes where they belonged.\n\nThe gun snapped the moment into obedience and then trusted the bodies to keep it there. Dara took the four like a sentence she had rehearsed enough to not hate, kept fifteen as if it were a liturgy, let the wall of air at two stop being a wall because she had told it so, and saw at three the old theatre curtain of shadow and refused to let it be the beginning of a play. Her hips stayed where coach and Bu Rara and gravity and her own stubbornness had agreed they should be, and her arms were as uninteresting as a chair leg, which in hurdle running is a compliment. She felt the small giving way at six that had become a friend she let walk beside her rather than behind or in front, and she used the switch like a tool, not a scandal, moving to sixteen with the economy of a person who does not announce she is leaving a party. Nine, which is where liars come to test your temper, offered its usual deal, and she refused it without drama. Ten was the same teeth as before; she bit back and leaned without begging the tape to love her. The clock gave her a time that did not cause arguments and did not require apologies. Sari across the way looked at her with the fast smile of a runner who had read the same paragraph and enjoyed it, and the Balikpapan woman exhaled her \u201cpuh\u201d again and added a \u201csyukur\u201d in that small, private way athletes smuggle prayers into secular minutes.\n\nAfter, the sponsor\u2019s assistant found her like a bee that had decided to be kind and asked for two sentences at the tent with the logo. The producer had set up a simple frame, thank her better angels, just a bench and the lines on the track behind, the rhythm concept manifesting as a visual heartbeat. The young host asked what she had noticed in the call room and, for once, she told the truth in a way that did not feel extracted: the foxes on the lanyard, the scuff on the chair, the way someone\u2019s nail polish had chipped into a map of an island she didn\u2019t recognize and loved anyway, the way the hush sounded like fabric being folded. He asked if she had been afraid and she said she had been more interested than afraid, and that line fell out of her mouth like something she had earned the right to say, and she saw, in the producer\u2019s tiny nod, the relief of someone who had been looking for a way to sell integrity without renting trauma. When they were done, she refused a branded energy bar with polite firmness and took instead an unbranded banana from the bowl, which made the assistant grin like a co-conspirator.\n\nThe final the day after decided to be petty about weather. The heat rose up from the track in a visible shimmy that threatened to give seconds away to anyone too stubborn to pay it respect. At warm-up, sweat slicked the line at the back of her knee where the joint speaks, and she adjusted tape by feel because the glue on skin behaves differently when the day has taken sides. Bu Rara found her with a hand on the shoulder from behind, a touch that contained history without needing to announce it, and asked, almost offhand, what her one sentence was today. \u201cKeep hips, count, breathe,\u201d Dara said, then added, because bodies love specificity, \u201cno heroics at seven.\u201d The national coach clicked his tongue in a rhythm that, to his credit, lined up with the metronome they were trying to live inside. Sari tightened her spikes as if she were screwing them into the day.\n\nOn the set, a small child in the stands screamed a name that sounded like theirs but might have been someone the child had invented. Dara set blocks with care, the fast ritual of fingers on metal, heel against pedal, palms on surface, mind trimmed to the line. The gun did not betray anyone with an uneven crack. She went out controlled, resisted the bright insult of the backstretch sun, counted the world into a comprehensible list, and then at four something small and quick\u2014paper? leaf? the ghost of a cloud?\u2014caught the corner of her eye, and her brain yanked at the old alarm like a lever you know is supposed to stop trains. She did not lift her head. She did not look for proof or confirmation. She fell into the drum that she now kept as a room inside her chest: laba-laba is a syllable with no assignment, a percussive, a nothing that keeps a beat, count, count, count. The bar came, it always comes; she moved over it with an economy that would not make a highlight reel but would make a coach sigh later in private with satisfaction. The switch later than expected felt like a choice she had already rehearsed in heat, the sixteen arriving like a friend who knew where the spare key was. By eight, the soldiers in her legs had begun to mutter, and by nine they had filed a formal complaint, and by ten everyone had agreed that this was exactly what they had trained to be able to hate. She finished with a time that made the stadium behave, not go wild, but respect, and she stood very still for a second because stillness is sometimes the loudest celebration a body can manage.\n\nShe did not win; Sari did, with a finish that had made everyone in the first row lean forward involuntarily, their bodies recognizing expertise. Dara came second, and it was a clean second, not a grudging one. When the board confirmed it with the impersonal kindness of capital letters, she let herself nod once, a movement so small it needed its own microscope, and then walked off because walking uses a different grammar from victory and she wanted to speak both. In the mix zone, someone stuck a phone toward her with the question about brand and resilience already cued, and she answered with a sentence that was part script and part truth, a compromise she was learning to execute without feeling soiled: people see what they can use; I run for what I can hold. The assistant caught her eye over the top of the phone and mimed a tiny bow and then steered the conversation toward shoes, which cost no one anything but money.\n\nIn the stands, her mother had come in a bus later than any mother would accept and sat in the second row because an aunt\u2019s cousin\u2019s son worked at the gate and had given her a wristband with more power than it deserved. She clutched a hand fan that had been a wedding souvenir from 2006 and waved it with a ferocity that could have moved weather if weather were polite. Her stepfather sat with knees wide, a man who had learned to take up space late and still wasn\u2019t entirely convinced of his right to do it, and he watched with the attention he gave to engines, listening for a misfire or a tick, relaxing when none came. When she jogged the courtesy circle and saw them, she did not alter her line because she had decided that was a kind of extra she didn\u2019t owe anyone, but she allowed her mouth to tilt in a way that would be visible only if you knew her face. Later, when they met in the concourse where air tries to remember breezes, her mother kissed her forehead with the awkwardness of everyone\u2019s eyes, and her stepfather shook the coach\u2019s hand like men do when a shared project has decided to behave and then ruined the moment by blurting out, \u201cSaya bikin halang rintang di rumah,\u201d with pride, and the coach, who understands artisan craziness when he sees it, said, \u201cYa bagus, tapi jangan sampai anaknya jatuh di dapur,\u201d and they all laughed, relief making the sound bigger than the joke deserved.\n\nThe call from the ward came when she was sitting on her bag trying to trick it into closing without compromising on snacks. It was short and clean. Numbers were good. The doctor had allowed himself the smallest smile on the mask, a movement you could almost miss if you did not know his face already. The nurse with the bracelets said the word engraftment with the same tone she uses to announce afternoon tea. Rafi himself, groggy and proud, said his white blood cells had finally stopped acting like old men in an argument and had allowed the new ones to join the club, and then he coughed and handed the phone to their mother who cried without apologizing for once. Dara told them about the race and did not make her own news into a smaller thing for humility\u2019s sake because she had learned that everyone in this family was allowed to have a headline sometimes.\n\nThe national selection meeting was an exercise in bureaucracy disguised as sport, and she sat through it with the patience of a person who has watched drips and beeps become a day. Names were read into rosters and pruned from them; someone\u2019s face fell in a way that made her look away because you don\u2019t ogle another person\u2019s falling. Her name came where she had hoped, not because she believed herself entitled to it but because the work had been done and the work had been the right kind. Sari sat back with that careful breath of someone who will not show relief where it can be counted against her, and they shook hands in a tight, feminine handshake that would look like nothing to anyone who didn\u2019t know these hands had both been educated by wood and rubber and scolding and failure and had learned how to carry a little joy without letting it slip. Vina got her relay spot and made the air taste like sugar for five minutes before deciding she had to post immediately to keep the sweetness from souring without her management. Naya\u2019s name was on a list that had once felt too pointy for her, and she let herself hold her face with both hands for a second and then went to call someone she needed to tell first.\n\nBack home, the sofa in the living room, that old argument turned furniture, received her with its cracked leather and its rude memory. The note her mother had tucked in the tape pocket had been found two days ago when she needed to fix a blister, and she had read it in the bathroom, sitting on the closed lid of the toilet with the old tile\u2019s flowers making their dated parade under her feet. She had folded the paper and put it in the back of her phone case because technology should carry these things when bodies run out of pockets. Her stepfather took her to the yard and pointed at the hurdle like a person introducing a child to a teacher, and she did two drills on it in her slippers because ceremony can sometimes cement love. He told her the drain hadn\u2019t complained in two storms, and she told him that drains and hamstrings are alike: they require maintenance and the acceptance that sometimes they will be stupid for no reason. He laughed and said he preferred engines because engines don\u2019t have histories, and she said engines lie, and he said everything lies if you listen to it wrong, and they both shrugged the way people do when they have found a disagreement that can live safely in the house.\n\nThe sponsor, encouraged by the clean narrative arcs of the week, sent a message asking if she would consider a long-form piece about \u201covercoming,\u201d and she replied with a sentence that had taken her months to learn: she did not overcome anything; she negotiated with it. The assistant sent back three heart emojis that felt sincere and a promise to educate. The producer sent a voice note saying she would bring only one camera if they did a porch interview and would leave if the dog started complaining about the tape again, and Dara said fine because you have to feed some machines to keep their teeth off more important things. She declined a request to film at the hospital and was surprised and warmed when the assistant wrote, \u201cOf course,\u201d and offered alternative images that did not require anyone to tell her brother\u2019s story for him.\n\nOne evening, when the light over the alley had decided to be theatrical, she walked to the warung at the end of the street to buy shallots and a packet of coffee her mother swore tasted better because it was cheap. A web had been strung between the two iron bars of a gate in a diagonal that would have offended any geometry teacher and delighted any child. The spider that had decided this was a good place to be was small and brown and unassuming, the project modest and efficient. A boy chased a ball nearby and did the clumsy feint children practice on impervious opponents, and he ran toward the gate, toward the web, toward the inevitable, and she could have shouted, and she did not, because you are allowed to let the world break its minor beauties and remake them tomorrow. The ball hit the post and the web shivered, then held, then gave a little, and the spider moved with the competence of its kind to adjust tension. The boy ran on. The day did not break. She bought shallots and coffee, and the seller threw in two chilies and a \u201cbuat cantik\u201d which had nothing to do with looks and everything to do with the way the aunties like to bless the girls who run past their shops and then run into television and then run back again.\n\nAt practice the next morning, the dog had finally abandoned the tape and had fallen in love with a cone. He herded it up and down the grass with an attention that would have made him a good assistant coach if he had owned a whistle. The sky over the stadium had acquired the color that makes even the laziest person consider sweeping. Pak Bram had them do a series that started simple and then made small, intelligent demands, and he grunted approval or dismissed slop with equal economy. Bu Rara stood with a notebook she may or may not write in and watched like someone who intends to steal a method and return it improved. Sari texted a picture of her breakfast with a caption that made fun of the coffee at the training center, and Dara sent back a photograph of the homemade hurdle with a filter that made it look more noble than it was. The sponsor\u2019s assistant posted a story of a chalk line and a count, tagged no brands, and wrote only \u201clatih,\u201d which made three teenagers in a school two streets over decide to go for a run that afternoon and argue later whether fifteen was a mystic number or just practical.\n\nIn the quiet before the next travel, with the track holding the day\u2019s heat like a memory and the city deciding how to spend its evening, Dara sat on the bleacher and thought about how much of this was accidental and how much was a plan she hadn\u2019t admitted to having. She would go again to the stadium with the bigger mouth and the lights that turn skin into armour or into water depending on the angle. She would visit the ward and take the role the chair had for her and not be heroic about it. She would say no to nets and yes to rhythm. She would put her hand in her shoe without speaking to God first. She would ask her stepfather to check the screws on the homemade hurdle because it had begun to squeak in a way that sounded like a rumor. She would run because she loved it more than she was scared of it, and some days that ratio would reverse and she would pay interest later. She would listen to the body\u2019s lies and the brain\u2019s lies and the day\u2019s lies and choose the version that allowed her to place a foot where it needed to be, on a line painted by someone she did not know, at a speed that made sense only to people whose hearts had decided that the best work is the work you carry inside your chest and never put down. She stood, counted to a number that was both an incantation and a joke, and went to stretch with the ridiculous elegance of a girl who had learned to move inside her own weather without making it the headline.",
