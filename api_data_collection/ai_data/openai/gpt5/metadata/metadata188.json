     "novel_text": "It\u2019s cold the way certain truths are cold, unbothered by your opinion. Minneapolis in late February has the kind of frost that gets into your marrow and starts rearranging the furniture. The sky is crisp paper. The sidewalks bite. Plows hiss past like creatures that have made peace with this place and don\u2019t care if you have. I am not immune to cold. I never claimed to be.\n\nI watch my breath plume outside the glass wall of the animal shelter on Hennepin, hands hooked inside the pockets of a coat I bought because the salesperson liked me. She smiled like a carousel; it was enough. I practice a smile in the reflection of the glass\u2014a smile I know will look acceptable, open, but not too much. People believe in medium.\n\n\u201cHi there,\u201d says a volunteer holding the door. His nametag says GUS in childish block letters. He has a gray knit beanie with a pompom, red cheeks, a wholesome face that would probably cry if you pressed the right buttons.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say. The smile lands. Not perfect. Passable. If I were grading.\n\n\u201cFirst time here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019ve been here three times. I catalog movements. Where the noise swells. The way people kneel and get soft around the cages as if the right angle will make their hearts bigger. Stalls of small lives and the small talk that cages make. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to someone about adopting.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat. Come on in.\u201d His breath is the smell of winter and something else\u2014balm? He holds the door open longer than necessary. People do that. There are rituals that prove you\u2019re good.\n\nInside is warm, and the warmth feels worse somehow. Like stepping into someone\u2019s breath. Wet dog, bleach, rubber toys, human perfume trying to win over animal truth and failing. The dogs erupt when we pass. Some jump, some wag, some press themselves to the back corners of their crates like punks who don\u2019t need you. I absorb each detail almost greedily. I can always see the edge of things.\n\nGus leads me to a desk and hands me a clipboard. He does it with two hands like it\u2019s ceremonial.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d\n\n\u201cMara.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust Mara?\u201d\n\n\u201cMara Koenig.\u201d I decided years ago to keep my family name. My father said, at the time, it sounded like a story. He meant a warning.\n\nHe nods at the clipboard. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an application, some basic questions. Where you live, references, that kind of stuff. One of our adoption counselors will talk to you after you look around. No pressure.\u201d\n\nNo pressure. It\u2019s a phrase like a placebo. It\u2019s designed to make you feel as if you have agency. It makes me feel nothing at all.\n\nI take the clipboard and pen. It\u2019s one of those cheap ballpoints that chews the page and occasionally leaks like a tiny vein has popped. I fill in boxes with neat block letters. There are questions that are charmingly naive and questions that are traps.\n\n\u201cDo you plan to have your pet sleep on your bed?\u201d\n\u201cWhere will your pet be while you are at work?\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever surrendered an animal?\u201d\n\u201cHow many hours per day will your pet be alone?\u201d\n\nI answer truthfully, as much as I can. I have a good job that allows me to work from home three days a week. I say this, because rescue volunteers like that. The assumption that proximity equals love. Perhaps it does, sometimes. I understand proximity. I understand repetition. They are cousins.\n\n\u201cDo you believe in training?\u201d the form asks, in slightly different words, with phrases like positive reinforcement and dominance and e-collar and prong collar like little landmines. I circle \u201cpositive reinforcement.\u201d I can be positive when it pays.\n\nGus disappears to fetch something\u2014coffee, or a file\u2014and the dogs continue their chorus. A chocolate mutt with a comet tail watches me with yellow eyes. As if he\u2019s filing me, too.\n\nI feel my phone buzz in my pocket and slip it out. There are messages stacked like plates. One from June: You\u2019re really doing it. She\u2019s included a GIF of a cartoon dog wearing a sweater. Another from my mother with no text, just a link to an article about dog bites and \u201ctypes\u201d of people who shouldn\u2019t own dogs. She doesn\u2019t know how to copy a link without sending the entire ad-choked page. Her confidence in technology almost endears me. Almost.\n\nJune\u2019s second text: Remember to look \u201csoft.\u201d Bring your voice down. You know how you get.\n\nI type back: I am soft as a wool hat.\n\nShe sends a row of laughing faces and then adds, In case you forget, dogs can tell. People can too. But you know. Love you.\n\nThe word love makes a tiny ripple in me. It always has. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t value it. It\u2019s just\u2026 a word that seems to lose its shape when I look at it too long. Like a soap bubble: too much attention and it pops.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Gus reappears with a woman who looks like a sturdy book. Square shoulders, no-nonsense cardigan, the kind of woman you would ask for a Band-Aid and be right. Her nametag says KATY.\n\n\u201cMara?\u201d she says, the question softening the edges. \u201cI\u2019m Katy. I do adoptions and also foster the big goofballs nobody else can handle. You want to look at some pups first, or go through your app?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to meet them,\u201d I say. Honest. The clean hit of their need is\u2026 interesting. Like a challenge. Like a riddle I can solve.\n\nWe walk the corridor. The dogs do what dogs do: they perform. They whine and smile and bark with their whole bodies. Some withdraw. Some lick the air. The chocolate mutt with the comet tail watches without performing at all, his eyes a polished amber. He is not begging. He is learning me.\n\n\u201cThis is Rocket,\u201d Katy says. \u201cCame in with two siblings from a hoarding situation. He\u2019s smart. Mouthy. Food motivated. Could be a star with the right person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like stars,\u201d I say, and feel childish. June would smile at that.\n\n\u201cWant to say hi?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nShe opens the gate and Rocket rushes out as if the world is a tree to climb. He circles my legs, sniffs my hands, sits without being asked. Good boy, good boy, such a good boy, my mouth says, and my voice does that thing June mentioned, the thing I practiced. A softness, a rounding of edges. I scratch his chest exactly where he wants me to, because there are obvious places to scratch that humans miss in their excitement.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s picking up on you,\u201d Katy says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a calm vibe.\u201d\n\nCalm is the more agreeable word for it. I smile appropriately. Rocket leans into my palm as if my bones are something he recognizes. That is always the trick of it: proximity, repetition, reward. The body learns. The mind sits later and decides how it feels.\n\nKaty watches us as if an answer is forming. I let Rocket mouth the edge of my sleeve and then redirect him gently to a toy. Positive reinforcement. It\u2019s just another phrase for transaction.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking you\u2019d need a yard, or a commitment to more walks than Netflix. I\u2019m thinking you\u2019d need a trainer willing to work with both of you. I\u2019m thinking your landlord\u2019s pet policy is going to matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy building allows dogs under fifty pounds with a deposit,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to walk twice a day. Three times. I don\u2019t like Netflix.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone likes Netflix,\u201d Katy says, the kind of joke people make to test your humanity.\n\n\u201cI like books.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven weirder.\u201d She grins to show that I\u2019ve passed her test. We are human in the same room. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the thing. We do home checks. We talk to neighbors. It\u2019s not personal, but people get\u2026 particular. We\u2019ve had situations. We want to be careful. You get it?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a tug in my chest I identify as irritation. Home checks make sense. Information makes sense. The neighbor part less so. Soliciting the opinions of people who play corn hole at 9 p.m. in the courtyard and set garbage next to the bin because inside is too hard. The woman who watches me water plants and once told me my basil was too aggressive.\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I say, because understanding is different than agreeing. \u201cHow soon?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could get out there this week,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious.\u201d\n\nI look at Rocket, who has moved to inspect my boots. I want him the way I want clean lines. I want him like a problem set. I want him because caring is an experiment I have not yet run with anything that can lick my face and ruin my shoes. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\nShe nods. \u201cGus\u2019ll process your app. You have references listed\u2014June Park, okay, and\u2026 your supervisor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch. Meanwhile, meet a few more? See if anyone else chooses you when you\u2019re not looking?\u201d\n\nI say yes. I let them choose me for twenty more minutes, and I choose none of them back. I listen to the cadence of volunteer voices. Good boy, honey, easy now. I imagine what it will be like to come home to movement. To have an animal that does not care whether I am the sort of woman people have complicated feelings about.\n\nOutside, the cold smacks me awake again as if I\u2019d fallen asleep pressed to a radiator. I text June: Rocket. The name makes me think of impossible arc. I type: He chose me. Meeting a counselor again. Home check soon. I add a neutral face, then delete it, then add a sparkler. People like decoration.\n\nJune answers almost immediately, because June\u2019s phone is an extension of her fingertips: Meet me at Fixations? I\u2019m picking up yarn before my class.\n\nFixations is the kind of shop you go into and forget what you came for because the colors do something to you. It\u2019s tucked between a halfhearted vape store and a boutique that sells houseplants like they\u2019re pets with even fewer demands. The bell over the door rings in two notes that remind me of a doorbell at a house where the people were always laughing. I enter the sweater smell and feel something like relief. It\u2019s warmer here than the shelter. It\u2019s warmer than an idea.\n\nJune looks up from a wall of wool and wiggles her fingers at me, the nails stubby and practical, flecked with sky blue. She is a tall olive branch of a woman with hair she refuses to cut and a cardigan she knit herself as a dare. On some people a cardigan is armor. On June it\u2019s a story. She hugs me like we climbed the same mountain, and my body allows it, then decides it likes it.\n\n\u201cYou did it,\u201d she says into my ear. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you I could\u2026 I don\u2019t know, buy an alpaca.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is cruel to alpacas,\u201d I say. It\u2019s a joke. It lands. She grins.\n\n\u201cTell me everything.\u201d\n\nWe settle in a back corner among baskets and skeins. A class is in full swing at a central table, a ring of women and one man all counting stitches in a litany that feels like church in a language I could learn. The teacher\u2014an older woman with steel hair and cat-eye glasses, mouth painted the purposeful red of women who choose their own lives\u2014holds up a pair of knitting needles like chopsticks made for giants.\n\n\u201cRocket,\u201d I say, and then tell June what she already knows because I texted it. I fill in details the way one might fill a jar with marbles: heavy first, slipping into gaps. My voice is flat but the content is interesting; I can do this. It\u2019s just data in a different frame.\n\nJune leans back and listens the way she does, with her whole face. \u201cI like the name,\u201d she says. \u201cI like that he sat for you. I like that you said books instead of Netflix. I like that your mouth did the soft thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always catch the mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mouth tells on you,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the best way. Are you nervous about the home check?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d The truth. Anxiety is a vague fog other people walk into; I\u2019m usually just awake or asleep.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She reaches for a hank of heathered gray and rubs it between finger and thumb as if it holds a secret. \u201cWell, I\u2019m nervous for you, which will cancel everything out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cancel things like that,\u201d I say, and we both look at the wall of wool as if it will answer a math problem.\n\nThe class erupts into laughter because someone has done something wrong in a charming way. The teacher taps a needle on the table and says, \u201cThe heart of your ribbing is your intention,\u201d and everyone shuts up the way people do when a grandmother says something both ridiculous and true.\n\nJune narrows her eyes. \u201cI want that on a tote bag,\u201d she says. \u201cOr tattooed on my butt. Hey, have you eaten? I could knit you a sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Butter. My treat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have money.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop making money so aggressively,\u201d she says. \u201cIt alarms the yarn.\u201d Her hand slips into mine for a second, a small pressure like a periodic table property, something that exists whether I believe in it or not. \u201cI\u2019m excited about you being excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am excited,\u201d I say, tasting the word. It lands on my tongue like a coin. I flip it. It lands heads.\n\nWhen I get back to my building that evening, the lobby smells like chlorine and someone\u2019s dinner. The mailboxes are the kind that promise secrets and deliver coupons. I flip through envelopes like a gambler and toss most of them into the recycling bin. When the elevator doors open I consider the eight steps to the stairwell and decide I should practice for having a dog. We will take steps together. We will repeat them until they belong to us.\n\nOn the second floor, Mrs. Barlow\u2019s door is cracked. She is an avian woman who coats the hall with her opinions like hairspray. Her small dog wears a sweater and a permanent alarmed expression. In my mind their voices are one voice.\n\n\u201cMara,\u201d she calls, because that is what she does when she hears motion. \u201cYou\u2019re home early. Is that on purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is on purpose,\u201d I say, then remember the home check, the neighbor interviews. I tuck the sharpness in. \u201cGood evening.\u201d I put warmth in my mouth the way people add lemon to tea.\n\nShe peers at me like I am the answer to a question she didn\u2019t study for. \u201cThey said someone from a rescue might ask about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ladies from 11-C. The ones with the twins. They asked me if I trusted you with a dog. I said that depends on the dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, unsure if I mean it. I picture the twins as white noise machines in tiny sneakers. \u201cDid they ask if I\u2019m quiet, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all know you\u2019re quiet. People like to fill in quiet with whatever scares them. Personally, I appreciate quiet. My husband was a carpenter. He left a hum behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of hum?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kind that builds something and then doesn\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d she says, then tilts her head as if she\u2019d said something stranger than she intended. \u201cWell. You tell them nice rescue ladies that you smell like decent coffee and you pick up your packages on time.\u201d\n\nI nod. \u201cThat seems actionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I like you,\u201d she adds, which is one of the few sentences in English that can make people cry. \u201cYou look... like you know where you\u2019re going. But sometimes I think that\u2019s not the same as being kind. You know how people confuse those.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I say. I do.\n\nInside my apartment the heat clicks on like a decision. It\u2019s a clean space. Not spare, exactly, but precise. The couch has angles. The bookshelves are organized by color because it stirs visitors. A plant in the corner thrives despite me. I open the window to let in a scratch of cold and sit at my kitchen table with a notebook, because pens and paper anchor me in a way screens never will.\n\nI write: Things Rocket Will Need. I break it into categories without thinking. Food (grain-free? ask June), bowls, leash, harness, bed (no stuffing to rape, June\u2019s phrase), crate, toys (Kongs, rope, puzzle), vet, trainer, snow boots for me, paw balm for him. I write paw balm and feel the swish of the words like a tongue on teeth.\n\nI do not write: what will it feel like to be watched by a creature with no agenda but the next moment? Because I can\u2019t quantify that and I won\u2019t try. Not yet.\n\nI sleep, eventually, with a sharp clean tiredness I recognize from other beginnings. The start of a course. The first night in a new apartment. The morning before a hike the internet says is moderate and ends up rearranging your knees. When I wake, light is already pushing at the blinds, and the city has made a thousand small noises without me.\n\nMy phone hums. From an unknown number: Hi, this is Katy from the shelter. Can we do a home check Thursday at 10 a.m.? We can bring Rocket for a trial too if you\u2019re ready.\n\nI type Yes before considering the optics of eagerness. Then: Please bring Rocket. Thank you. The words stand there, polite. I add: Looking forward to it. A garnish.\n\nJune sends a string of knit emojis, which look like bowls of noodles to everyone else. Butter at noon on Saturday to celebrate? she texts. Also I found something weird at the thrift shop. Bring coffee.\n\nI go to work. I answer emails. My supervisor calls my name as if it\u2019s a dog that\u2019s wandered. \u201cMara,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019re thrilled about your initiative on the Bergstrom account. How do you feel about spearheading more of the client communications?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I say, which is the right answer if you want more work and less conversation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a rock,\u201d he says, and I think: No. Rocks don\u2019t move. I move.\n\nBy Thursday morning the apartment is auditable. I rearrange less than one would expect. I hide a book with a cover that would make Katy think I am trying to appear to be something I am not. I leave the plant where it is, thriving. I put away the knife block because Mrs. Barlow\u2019s hum concerns me. I take out the trash and then take it out again as if trash multiplies overnight. I brush my teeth twice and wonder if dogs care about human breath.\n\nThe knock is a sequence with a personality. Two quick, one slow. I open to Katy and Gus and a thread of winter behind them. Rocket is an orbiting idea at the end of a leash until he sees me, and then the line straightens as if he knew we were on the same page of the same book, which is a ridiculous metaphor. He licks my wrist once, definitively. I let the soft come.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s almost natural. \u201cCome in.\u201d\n\nKaty does the tour and I hang back the way people hang back when someone else is leading a blindfolded party through their own home. \u201cFloors are solid,\u201d she says, tapping the wood with the toe of her boot. \u201cNo loose rugs. Window screens are\u2026 present.\u201d She checks an outlet as if electricity is the kind of thing you can persuade. \u201cCrate fits there. You\u2019ve got a line of sight from the couch so he doesn\u2019t feel exiled. Good.\u201d\n\nGus throws a rope toy for Rocket and Rocket brings it back like the end of the world depends on it. The three of them make noises that are almost identical: little ahs and wows, the language of delight. It\u2019s contagious if you want it to be. I let it in. I say, \u201cGood boy,\u201d not because Katy wants to hear it but because the dog does.\n\nKaty\u2019s eyes track shelves, corners, the blank space under the windowsill where a radiator would have been in a different life. She asks questions with her eyebrows. I answer with my mouth. We do a dance of competence. We all feel civilized.\n\nThen the neighbor part, which comes the way a cough comes, inevitable and unpleasant. \u201cWe reached out to a few people in your building,\u201d Katy says, flipping a folder shut as if that contains consequences. \u201cMostly positive. Mrs. Barlow loves you. The twins\u2019 moms said you are\u2026 head down, reserved, never had guests?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a crime?\u201d I ask. My voice almost laughs, almost snaps. I let it ripple out and become nothing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the rescue has to consider\u2026 fit. Dogs who need people. People who need dogs. People who like community. Mrs. B said you\u2019re very responsible but sometimes look at her dog like you\u2019re taking an exam.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I say. I let a smile crack. \u201cHe\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\n\nKaty looks at me for a beat too long, the way you look at a painting you don\u2019t know if you like yet. \u201cI think Rocket likes you,\u201d she says finally. \u201cI think you could do this well. I\u2019m just the messenger, though. The board votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll be in touch. Don\u2019t despair if it\u2019s a no at first. Sometimes no turns into not yet.\u201d\n\nGus says, \u201cHe sat in your bathroom. He only does that when he feels safe,\u201d and I imagine what it is to be told your bathroom is a sanctuary. It\u2019s not wrong.\n\nWhen they leave, Rocket\u2019s leash in hand, the apartment feels like the minus of something. It\u2019s clean and warm and full of a sound that isn\u2019t there. I stand very still and then I don\u2019t.\n\nI go to Butter to meet June. The place is full of the good chaos of plates and batter and people whose hair is doing whatever it wants. The coffee here tastes like someone\u2019s best morning. June has taken a table in the corner with a view of the door because she likes to notice arrivals. She has a paper bag with a logo I don\u2019t recognize, which means it\u2019s going to be something we call a treasure even if it\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d she asks, and I read the answer in her eyes before I say it.\n\n\u201cThey liked my bathroom,\u201d I say. \u201cThey were unsure about my face.\u201d\n\nShe squeezes my wrist the way one might squeeze a lemon. \u201cSo they\u2019re human,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t let them be your god.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a god,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou have many gods,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just disguise them as habits. Here. Look what I found.\u201d She reaches into the bag and yields a knitting needle the color of tarnished moonlight. It\u2019s metal, not quite aluminum, not quite steel, thin the way a whisper is thin. The end of it has a little cap in the shape of a rose, or maybe a thorny star. It catches the light in a peculiar way, like it\u2019s absorbing the room and giving you back a different version.\n\n\u201cIt was in a bin with old belts and a fur hat that smelled like the nineteen-seventies,\u201d she says. \u201cLook at the tip. It\u2019s odd. It\u2019s almost\u2026 warm?\u201d\n\nI touch it and feel the heat of her hand. And then, just beneath that, something else. A hum. Not loud. Not showy. The kind of hum a refrigerator makes in the middle of the night that reminds you the world is still working. \u201cIt\u2019s probably cheap,\u201d I say. \u201cEven cheap things can feel real.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven real things can feel cheap,\u201d she says, and then laughs at herself because she sounds like the cat-eye teacher. \u201cI thought I might use it for the scarf I\u2019m making you. The soft one. The kind your face will believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t knit a face,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d She turns the needle in the air, and I swear the light goes sideways for a second. The bell over the Butter door rings. A waitress drops a fork and the sound sticks to the air like a static balloon. June frowns. \u201cWeird,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a\u2026 lucky needle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing,\u201d I say, but I pocket the idea anyway. Luck is just pattern recognition you can\u2019t justify.\n\nWe eat eggs that taste like they remembered the chicken. June talks about the class at Fixations, about a woman who knit her feelings so tightly she gave herself a headache, about the man at the table who said purling reminded him of his mother\u2019s voice saying his name. I talk about Rocket and about the way he leaned into my hand and then away, both true. June\u2019s eyes go soft and then bright. The needle glints on the table like it is listening.\n\nWhen the call comes that night I am slicing carrots like an apology. The knife is new and cuts as if it\u2019s in a hurry. Katy\u2019s voice is both kinds of sorry. The kind you mean and the kind you sell.\n\n\u201cThe board is concerned,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you did. You were great and Rocket loved you. They just\u2026 there\u2019s a vibe. I\u2019m pushing, but I wanted you to hear it from me now. They have final say.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat vibe,\u201d I ask, though I know. The kind of non-vibe that makes people uneasy because it doesn\u2019t look like what TV taught them. The rest of the sentence is waiting.\n\n\u201cThey want a yard,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want kids. They want the story we tell ourselves about rescue and rescuees. Look, come in and volunteer. Let them see you. Sometimes it\u2019s not that they need more information. They need more proximity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I say, though my voice makes it sound like I\u2019m convincing a child.\n\nI hang up. I look at the carrot coins like money. I do not cry. I have cried before, in the dark, at movies where a dog dies and the music tells you how. It is an involuntary response like a sneeze. This is not that. This is\u2026 the pause in a song where something else could happen.\n\nJune arrives ten minutes later because she tracks my weather with a barometer she keeps in her chest. She doesn\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry. She hands me the tarnished needle and says, \u201cHold this,\u201d and then she looks at my face as if she is knitting it.\n\nI hold the needle. Maybe it vibrates. Maybe my hand does. The apartment hums with the heating vent and the refrigerator and the building\u2019s collective lungs. Something has to happen, and when it doesn\u2019t, I am almost relieved.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cOr the next day. Or we go somewhere else. There are other places. There are other dogs. There is this needle. There is me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fix things,\u201d I say. I say it because she will not take it as a challenge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI just keep you company while they break and while they mend.\u201d She looks at the needle again, suspicious. \u201cAnd sometimes I buy questionable metal objects from suspicious bins.\u201d\n\nWe do what we always do when there\u2019s a decision we didn\u2019t get to make. We make tea. We sit on the floor because chairs are too official. June tells me about a scarf pattern with the satisfying name of Fisherman\u2019s Rib. I tell her about Mrs. Barlow\u2019s hum. She listens like it matters. We both pretend we don\u2019t see the place on the rug where a food bowl could go.\n\nLater, after she has left, I take the needle out of its paper bag and lay it on the table next to my notebook. The cap with the little rose catches and throws the lamplight. I put my finger on the metal and wait. For luck. For the kind of story that turns a no into a not yet into a yes. For a dog who chooses me because I am exactly what he needs. The needle is quiet the way a lake is quiet from the shore. If it\u2019s magic, it\u2019s the kind that does not announce itself.\n\nI sleep without dreams, or with dreams I don\u2019t fetch. Morning comes sluggish and then suddenly. The city outside is a tractor beam of weather: sun on snow that looks like sugar, air that will punish your ears if you forget your hat. I line my boots by the door because I will be a person who walks twice a day. I put the needle in my coat pocket because carrying an object makes it mine.\n\nOn the way to work, I cut through Loring Park and watch a man teach his lab to heel. The dog looks at him like he is the good kind of god. The man laughs the way people laugh when they feel seen and in charge. I imagine Rocket and me. I imagine what it is to be useful to another animal.\n\nMy phone buzzes with a number I know now. Rocket\u2019s file, the subject line says. Inside is a note: We\u2019re going to revisit your case next week. In the meantime, would you like to foster one of Rocket\u2019s siblings? Short-term. See how it feels.\n\nI stop on the bridge and the snow on it sparkles like secrets. The city is moving because that is what cities do. June always says you can knit a sweater one stitch at a time and eventually your whole body is warm. I type: Yes. I type: Yes. I type: Yes. Then I add: I would like that very much, even if the very much feels like an outfit I\u2019ve borrowed for a party I haven\u2019t been invited to yet.\n\nThe air decides to find my face and pinch it. I put a hand in my pocket. The needle sits there like a line I have not yet cast. I imagine what a magic object would do if it wanted to be useful. Then I stop imagining and walk to the office, because not all magic is dramatic. Sometimes it\u2019s just the part of your life that keeps the rest from getting too quiet.\n\nAt lunch I meet June on Nicollet and we stand in a patch of sun as if we can feed from it. She peeks at the pocket with the needle. \u201cYou carried it,\u201d she says. \u201cSuperstitions look good on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made Loring Park feel like a place instead of a set,\u201d I say. I surprise myself.\n\n\u201cSee? I told you. It\u2019s totally benign witchcraft.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, half laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ll scare the rescue board.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, eyes rolling skyward. \u201cThey can go knit their own noses.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the ribbing of the nose matter,\u201d I ask, and she snorts so loudly a pigeon startles.\n\nThe week moves like an animal that knows the path and isn\u2019t in a hurry. I volunteer at the shelter on Monday night and mop floors while a terrier named Olive tries to mop me. I listen to the way people sweeten their voices. Good girl. Good. There is a high schooler who speaks to the husky like it\u2019s a god and a man in a suit who can\u2019t stop checking his watch even while a dog licks his palm. I stand with Olive until she stops shaking, which takes exactly seven minutes and the tone of voice I learned as a child when my mother\u2019s favorite vase broke and she didn\u2019t know whose fault it was and I told her, Nobody\u2019s.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Katy texts: Today at five? Bring your soft voice. The sibling\u2019s name is Sprite.\n\nI leave my office as if it isn\u2019t trying to keep me. The sky at five is the color of tin. The snow has conceded to grit. Sprite is smaller than Rocket and more nervous. She trembles in the car and then in the elevator and then less, in the apartment, in the hall of my refrigerator and my sink. I show her the crate like it\u2019s a tent and she walks in and sits and looks at me as if waiting for a story.\n\n\u201cYou are not Rocket,\u201d I say. \u201cYou are not less either.\u201d\n\nShe blinks. June arrives with a bag of treats and the needle tucked through her hair like an ornament. \u201cI heard Sprite,\u201d she says, and Sprite hears her name and wags once, decisively. Dogs are practical poets. They understand repetition and emphasis.\n\nWe sit on the floor. June knits a row, purls a row, knits two, purls two, and the scarf grows like a sentence. The needle in her hair slides a little and then stops. I think of Mrs. Barlow\u2019s hum, of the man in Loring Park, of Rocket\u2019s mouth on my sleeve, of the fact that I do not need a yard to be a place.\n\nThat night, when Sprite curls into a comma at the foot of my bed because I could not bear the crate for her first night and maybe never will, the needle on my nightstand catches the streetlight and keeps it. If it does magic, it does it without confetti. If it has a promise, it is not loud.\n\nI do not think about whether my face looks like kindness in the dark. I do not think about the board. I do not think about anything at all for a long time. When Sprite sighs, it sounds like a decision. When I fall asleep, I am surprised to find that I do it with my hand outstretched, fingers just touching the cool metal of something that may or may not be lucky. The air outside doesn\u2019t care about luck. It will be cold tomorrow. We will put on boots. We will walk anyway.Sprite wakes me in the gray between alarms where the city is awake but hasn't decided how. She does it by placing her chin on the mattress and exhaling like a timid dragon. The room has that morning cold that turns noses into small arguments and makes you aware of your ears. I slide my hand out from the covers and the air bites hard enough to remind me where I live. Sprite licks my knuckles once and then takes her head away as if the contact startled her too. She smells like the shelter still, a cocktail of bleach and dry kibble and maybe a hint of whatever grass exists beneath all this snow.\n\nI speak the way June suggested, as if the words have wide hems. Good morning. We\u2019ve been alive all night. I say it as if it\u2019s a joke and a blessing and Sprite blinks in the slow way of creatures who have long ago decided that speed is not the same as safety. When I sit up she steps back, tail low but moving, and her eyes make a bracket shape at the corners. Body language is just syntax with fur. I get up without turning on the light because I know where my toes are supposed to go, and because light feels like an accusation when you haven\u2019t earned it yet.\n\nThe floor is cold and the air is colder. I pull on socks that I bought because they were described as suitable for long Arctic walks when accompanying a research team with a tendency to underreport the weather. Marketing is just a story with a mirror. Sprite follows me to the door and sits before I ask, a small victory that I didn\u2019t win. I put the leash on and she ducks and then presents her neck like a fragile bridge. The clip makes a polite sound that feels like asking and getting permission.\n\nOutside, the stairwell smells like old varnish and coin laundry. The hallway is quieter in the morning, like a throat clearing. Mrs. Barlow\u2019s door is closed for once, and I feel a childish tug of disappointment. Her dog is probably beneath a throw blanket thinking about the life it could have had if it had been born a hedgehog. On the second floor someone has left a grocery bag on the landing, and Sprite gives it an entire federal investigation before concluding that it is neither friend nor enemy. We move past it like dignity does.\n\nThe winter bites correctly. It finds the seam between glove and coat and shakes it a little, just to show that it can. Sprite steps onto the sidewalk and then lifts a paw like a ballerina who didn\u2019t see the ice. I make the sound June calls my spill prevention noise, a low oh-oh-oh that is ridiculous and works anyway. Sprite gives me a glance that might be gratitude or might be the canine equivalent of You\u2019re embarrassing me, and then she adjusts her gait and we practice what it is to share a pace.\n\nLoring Park is less beautiful than yesterday and also more honest. The snow has turned to that pilled state sweaters get after hard use. The sun is out but doesn\u2019t want to be here, and I respect it for showing up anyway. A man runs past in shorts because men in Minnesota run in shorts like a religion, and Sprite watches him until he is a theory. When we reach the bridge, she stops. She looks through the railing at the blank white surface of the pond and then at me. If there were a caption it would be: I have been asked to believe many things, and I am not sure about this one. We stand there together for a pace too long, and then I say, Let\u2019s go, and we do.\n\nWe pass the lab from yesterday and his man. The man is wearing the sort of headband that suggests this is not his first winter with ears. He nods at me as if we share a profession. The lab gives Sprite one of those careful dog greetings, side-of-face, polite sniff, averted eyes, the whole exchange like a formal waltz at a ball for minor nobility. Sprite trembles at first and then inhales as if the other dog is a complicated soup she needs to identify ingredient by ingredient. They part without incident, and it feels like a small treaty. The man says, Cute, and I say, Thank you, as if I made her last night out of felt.\n\nBack home the elevator takes us with a sigh. Sprite leans against my leg in a way that is both clingy and brave. In the apartment I unclip the leash and she stands next to me waiting for instruction she doesn\u2019t need. I open the crate and toss in a biscuit like a coin into a well. Sprite goes in and turns around and sits as if the crate has told her a joke that only they share. I give her a second biscuit because I believe in redundancy when it comes to love. Then I stand in my kitchen and pour water into a kettle as if this were a ritual and not a crutch.\n\nWork is there whether I want it to be or not. I set up my laptop at the table because the couch asks for slouch and slouching feels like a sin before eight. Emails surge in with subject lines like gentle obligations. I answer them in the order Middle-of-the-road Me would approve. I keep an eye on Sprite in my peripheral vision. She chooses the spot near the radiator, which is not a radiator but a modern vent that is trying so hard to be good that I want to pat it. Sprite lowers herself and then uncoils, folds her paws under, and stares at me like I am nature.\n\nIn a lull between pings, I take the needle out of my coat pocket and put it next to the kettle. It gleams under the kitchen light like an object in a museum that insists on being labeled Untitled. I feel silly for carrying it and then I don\u2019t. The metal is cold, then not. When I roll it between my fingers it hums the way the refrigerator hums, the way my blood hums if I sit very still and listen. I wonder if I am making it up. I wonder what it would mean if I am.\n\nJune texts me a photo of a skein that looks like the inside of a seashell and says, Tell Sprite that the fishermen\u2019s rib will make her believe in the concept of texture, and I make a mental note to tell her the way an aunt tells a child about Santa knowing all the ways she does wrong and loving her anyway. The kettle lifts its small voice to a boil. I pour the water and the steam bursts up, and Sprite lifts her head like a question mark. I say, Tea, as if that answers something, and she lays her head back down as if it does.\n\nBy mid-morning, the part of my brain that watches other parts of my brain notes that I am monitoring Sprite\u2019s breathing the way some people monitor stocks. Each sigh tick marks on an invisible ledger. She gets up and follows me to the bathroom and sits outside the door, and I have a ridiculous thought about modesty, about animals that wait for the weather of their people to pass. When I am done I find her in the bathroom, sitting on the bath mat, gazing at the tub as if it contains history. The bathroom is a sanctuary, Gus had said, and I wonder why. Maybe it is the tile, the acoustics, the way rooms without soft things do not make extra noise. Maybe she likes the tightness of small corners. There are entire books about the way animals sleep.\n\nAt noon I make an omelet that is too perfect to eat if I were a different person. Sprite watches me whisk eggs with a focus that is nearly religious. I drop a piece of bell pepper and she ducks as if it might explode. When it does not, she creeps forward and takes it and chews it with the careful jaw motion of someone working out their feelings about vegetables. I find myself smiling with my actual mouth and not the practiced one. It is, in the spectrum of miracles, a minor one, but I catalog it because that is what I do with moments that might float away.\n\nThe afternoon is a quilt of tasks and pauses. I take the needle to my desk like talisman and pen. I click through slides and correct a colleague\u2019s slide title with exactly as much grace as I can manage, which is more than it would have been last year. I take Sprite out at three and we practice stairs again. On the third step landing, the grocery bag is gone and has been replaced with a wet shimmer that looks like ordinary water and is not. I make the oh-oh sound and then say, Wait, and Sprite waits. I test the shimmering patch with my boot and almost go down in a way that would have been slapstick if it weren\u2019t bones. I reach out to steady myself and my fingers find the needle in my pocket before they find the railing, and the needle is warm enough to startle me. It is probably my body heat after all these mornings of superstition. It is probable because the alternative requires permission.\n\nWe make it down without me becoming a lesson, and on the way back we run into one of the twins\u2019 mothers, the one with the good parka and the expression that says she has recently read an article about boundaries. She looks at Sprite and then at me and then she notices that I notice the looking. I smile somewhere between acceptable and open. She says, You fostering? and I say, Yes, like I am taking a test that will be scored by a committee. Her face softens, which is what it looks like when strangers decide to make room in their day for your existence.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sweet,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were worried about Rocket. He seemed\u2026 intense.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d I say, and surprise both of us. Sprite blinks between us, triangulating our weather. The twin mother nods and holds a bag of groceries up like an explanation for why she cannot help me if this goes wrong, and then she says, Good luck, and I say, Thank you, the kind you mean and the kind you sell.\n\nIn the late afternoon, the shelter calls to check in on Sprite. It\u2019s a woman I haven\u2019t met yet, with a voice like practical wool. She asks me about appetite, about elimination, about interest in play. I answer in a tone that is confident enough to make other people comfortable and truthful enough to make me feel like I have not moved my own furniture around. I say, She is cautious and curious, and I do not say, She has memorized the order in which I exhale. The woman says, Great, and then tells me that the board will meet Friday morning about Rocket and that I should not read anything into the timing because timing has its own agenda.\n\nWhen June gets off work, she arrives with a bag of chew bones and a small jar of something labeled paw balm in a handwriting that is half doctor, half kindergarten teacher. She sits on my floor the way people sit on floors when their bones know the score, and Sprite sidles up to her and lays her chin on June\u2019s knee with the kind of trust that makes your throat aware of itself. June always smells like citrus peels and the idea of lavender. She says to Sprite, We\u2019re going to like each other a reasonable amount, and Sprite wags once as if to sign a contract.\n\nWe practice an exchange game where you give a thing and get a better thing because that is the promise we all want from the world. Sprite takes the chew and then brings it back and then takes it again and then looks at me as if to confirm this is not a trick. June knits two rows and then holds the needle up to the light and says, This thing feels like an argument I\u2019m almost done winning, and the light through the window leans in and then leans away as if the afternoon is being edited. I look at the needle and it looks back in the way objects look back when you decide they do.\n\nAfter June leaves, I get careless. I am not careless often, and when I am, I notice. I put water on for pasta and then put the lid on the pot and then the lid slips off the spoon rest and clatters to the floor with that impossibly loud sound that lids make, as if they have been waiting their entire lives to demonstrate gravity. Sprite startles so hard that she becomes a different dog. She bolts. The door is ajar because I took out the trash and forgot that the world is a place where doors have rules. She shoots through the gap like a negative space. By the time my brain jams its feet into my mouth to say something useful, she is in the hall, then at the stairs, then on them, and the hall holds the echo she leaves behind like a hand.\n\nI do not swear because swearing is punctuation, and this requires grammar. I grab the leash and the bag of treats and I grab the needle because it is there and because I am superstitious when the alternative involves a body on concrete. The stairwell sucks heat out of everything that enters it. I take the steps two at a time and realize that I am the sort of person who will chase a frightened thing and that frightened things do not like to be chased. I slow down and adjust my mouth. I lower my voice to the level of just-a-river. Sprite, I say, and the syllable is the only one she knows and it means everything.\n\nOn the second-floor landing I hear the click of small nails and the sound of a body making itself narrow. I follow it past Mrs. Barlow\u2019s door and past the twins\u2019 door with the drawing of a snowman that looks like a surveillance camera. I turn the corner and find Sprite pressed into the far angle of the hall like a letter that slipped under the wrong door. Her eyes are black moons in winter. She is shaking so hard I can see her ideas. I do not make the mistake of going straight toward her. I sit down halfway down the hall and put the needle on the floor next to me because my hands feel like they might do something stupid and they need an occupation.\n\nWhen I breathe, I do it out loud because dogs believe in sound more than sense. I scatter three treats halfway between us and then I look at the ceiling as if I have seen better ceilings and this one is not the worst. Sprite watches my hand as if it is a small animal and then she watches my face. She half-stands and then sinks and then half-stands again as if hope and fear share a bed. I keep my voice low and bored and I say, Sprite, good girl, and then once I say, Come, and I make myself look away again to show that I am not a storm.\n\nThe needle is beside my shoe. If it is doing anything, it is doing it the way tea does things to water. The hall light buzzes the way bad fluorescent lights buzz in movies to warn you the killer is behind you. There is no killer. There is a dog who ran because her life recently became a door. After a minute that is ten minutes long, Sprite does the impossible math. She slides forward three inches and takes the first treat with a motion so quick it could be an edit. Her tail twitches at the very end like a punctuation mark. She takes the second and the third and then stops again, eyes on my hand. I do not move my hand. I wait. I become waiting. I make the space between us the right size.\n\nSprite takes a step into that space and then another and then the space is gone. When she is close enough that I could reach and ruin it, I do not. I hold myself still as the smallest promise. She sniffs my shoe and the needle and the leash and the edge of my knee, and then she sighs the way people sigh when they find a reason. I slide the leash under her chin and she lets me clip it. The click of the metal is the kind of sound you can love if you decide to.\n\nOn the way back up, I meet Mrs. Barlow coming down in a robe that suggests she believes in dressing for all occasions. Her little dog peers around her calf like a puppet that has seen things. Mrs. Barlow\u2019s hair is a careful nest. She looks at Sprite, at me, at the leash, at the needle in my other hand.\n\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re learning her,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd she\u2019s learning stairs are liars.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is,\u201d I say, and make myself say nothing else, because sometimes silence is the precise word.\n\nMrs. Barlow reaches out a hand as if to touch Sprite and then doesn\u2019t, which is the politest thing anyone has done all day. \u201cMy husband used to say we measure ourselves against the moments we don\u2019t throw away,\u201d she says. \u201cI think he made that up, but he said it like he\u2019d stolen it from a very wise man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the wise man,\u201d I say, and we both pretend for a second that he wasn\u2019t also a hum.\n\nThat night, Sprite sleeps in the crate with the door open. She chooses it the way you choose a closet when you\u2019re tired of being seen. I sit on the couch and my muscles remember their names. The needle sits on the coffee table by the notebook and the lamp and a cup with a chip on the rim that I refuse to throw away because the chip reminds me of a tooth I chipped on a pool edge when I was thirteen and too proud to cry in front of a boy I do not remember. The needle glints and the glint is not magical so much as it is an agreement with light. I write in my notebook: Sprite ran, Sprite returned, I did not fail, not in the obvious way, and then I add: Paw balm. It is a joke. It is also a to-do.\n\nThe next day is a Friday that can\u2019t decide who it wants to be. The sky is flat and the air is busy. I make coffee that tastes like the word reliable and Sprite eats her breakfast with the small smacking noises of someone trying to be polite. At nine, the board meets. I do not know that because anyone told me they start at nine; I know it because nine o\u2019clock feels like a time when people convene to become official. I do not watch the clock, but watching is one of my higher functions and I do not disable it for sport.\n\nAt nine thirty-six my phone rings. It is Katy. I let it ring for a full second and then another because entering a conversation with eagerness is like entering a cold lake: there are better strategies. When I answer, Katy sounds like a woman who knows a lot about hope and distrusts it anyway. \u201cWe talked,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we\u2026 want to move forward with you, with Rocket, but we want to see you with Sprite for a week. Consider it your practicum. Consider it our cover. Consider it whatever makes you feel like we\u2019re not apologizing for human feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour board is concerned with optics,\u201d I say, and I don\u2019t add a question mark because the question is implied.\n\n\u201cThey are concerned with outcomes,\u201d she says, parrying nicely. \u201cSometimes outcomes like to wear optics around the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do a week,\u201d I say. \u201cI can do longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe figured,\u201d she says, and I hear paper. \u201cMrs. Barlow says you have the look of someone who puts her anger away before guests arrive. She meant that as a compliment. The twins\u2019 moms say Sprite looks at you like you invented doors. That was more neutral than it sounds. I told them you said books instead of Netflix and they said, Oh.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople like to file,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cBe a folder,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll call Monday to schedule a meet. You doing okay? Sprite okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had an incident with a lid and a heroic recovery,\u201d I say, and then realize I said heroic without sarcasm and decide that vocabulary is a living thing. \u201cWe\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nI hang up and Sprite comes to rest her head against my shin. She knows when the weather shifts in the room. Animals know. They always have. I think of Rocket\u2019s amber eyes, of his name\u2019s promise of speed and the way speed is not what I want. I think of Sprite\u2019s tremble and the fact that bravery is not the absence of fear so much as it is a decision to walk anyway. I scratch behind her ear and she closes her eyes like a curtain.\n\nAt lunch I take Sprite to the small fenced dog area by the park that always seems to collect the sort of people who can narrate a weather system with their eyebrows. There are two dogs inside, a beagle with the energy of a children\u2019s book and a shepherd with knees like opinions. I set a perimeter in my head and then my body. Sprite walks in as if she has been asked to introduce herself and doesn\u2019t speak the language. The beagle gives her a sniff that is almost an argument and then decides she is acceptable. The shepherd ignores her because his ball is more important than anyone alive. The sky is the color of a spoon and the snow has turned to whatever snow turns into when it has had enough of us.\n\n\u201cNew?\u201d asks a woman with a hat that looks like a small creature nested there for warmth and forgot to leave.\n\n\u201cFoster,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d She sucks her teeth in the way that suggests she knows what that is from either side. \u201cShe\u2019s cautious.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I say, and the woman smiles in the way people smile when they have just made room for you on a bench.\n\nSprite does a small circle and then a larger one and then the kind of darting play bow that is a question, and the beagle answers the way beagles answer everything, with an enthusiasm that is only one notch away from panic. They chase each other in slow loops like those screensavers in the nineties that we all thought were proof that we were future people. The shepherd drops his ball at my feet and looks at me like this is a job interview. I throw it and he brings it back and I throw it again because sometimes the job is easier than you want to admit. Sprite watches us as if we are doing a math problem she will need to solve later.\n\nOn the way home, Mrs. Barlow is in the lobby with a paper bag of something that smells like cinnamon and truth. She has her dog under one arm like a baby that\u2019s learned to eavesdrop. She looks at Sprite and says, \u201cBetter,\u201d and I nod as if she is the board and I am making my case. She slips a small zip-top bag into my hand and says, \u201cHearts,\u201d and I look inside and see a handful of chicken hearts because Mrs. Barlow is not the person you thought she was when you met her hair. \u201cHumans like sprinkles,\u201d she says, answering my face. \u201cDogs like organs. Just little bits. Watch her, though. It\u2019ll change how she looks at you.\u201d\n\nI use one heart that night, and it does change how she looks at me. It is the look of a creature who has seen your knife and trusts it. It is not love. Love is too big a word, a soap bubble as I have said, a thing that pops when pressed. It is a sentence fragment that implies a sentence I might read again.\n\nJune arrives late, cheeks bitten by the air, and sits with her back against my couch and her legs out straight. She has the scarf around her neck and she has knit enough of it that it looks like something and not just ambition. The needle we found sits between us like a small metallic witness. I tell her about the lid and the hallway and the way Sprite uncoiled from herself like a spring that had been warning the world. She listens and then takes my hand with the same softness she uses to take yarn from an overfull basket.\n\n\u201cI am proud of you,\u201d she says, and then immediately makes a face as if the words have embarrassed her with their earnestness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to sound like an aunt in a TV movie. No offense to TV aunts. They always have snacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Barlow gave me chicken hearts,\u201d I say. \u201cI think that\u2019s snacks plus agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a witch of the useful sort,\u201d June says. She picks up the needle and holds it parallel to the coffee table and then slowly turns it until it is perpendicular. The lamplight runs along the shaft and gathers at the rose cap and then seems to drift one degree to the left. \u201cDo you feel that,\u201d she asks, and I can\u2019t tell if she means with her skin or her sense of symmetry.\n\n\u201cI felt it in the hall,\u201d I say, which is true and false in different directions. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give it too much. I don\u2019t want to owe it anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d she says, which is exactly the sort of thing I need pointed out. \u201cYou could carry it because it\u2019s pretty and because it reminds you that the world is made on purpose. That\u2019s magic enough. If it starts singing or eating light, we\u2019ll make a plan.\u201d\n\nThe weekend is a test I don\u2019t know I\u2019m taking until it is over. I wake at times I wouldn\u2019t have chosen and stand on sidewalks in air that feels personal. I praise small movements with the fervor of a convert. I discover I do like Netflix now that I have an animal to think about while pretending to watch. I pass the twins\u2019 moms in the mailroom and one of them says, Good morning in a way that is not forced, and the other says, I like her ears, and I say, Me too, with a weight I am surprised by. We pass the man with the lab again and he says, You\u2019re out early, and I say, I\u2019m out, and we both nod as if this explains the universe.\n\nOn Sunday, a snow decides to be a snow. It starts with small, apologetic flakes and then commits, and the city goes into the mode where everything is recognizable and also newly drawn. I take Sprite out and she lifts each paw high like a delicate dancer. We walk past the church with the brick belly and the stained glass that is probably a map to something someone lost. We pass the statue of the Scandinavian man whose expression says he has seen enough winter to ask for a manager. Sprite eats snow and then looks confused when it vanishes as if the world just tricked her on purpose. I laugh with my actual throat and not because I practiced.\n\nIn the afternoon, the shelter holds a volunteer training I promised to attend. I leave Sprite with a frozen Kong that will teach her patience or at least how to resent me generically, and I go to the shelter where the warm feels like breath again. The training is led by a young man with a face like a friendly toaster. He tells us about leash manners and body language and the danger of letting the dogs learn to anticipate only disappointment. He says, We are the pattern and uses his hands to draw a rectangle in the air, and I feel the needle in my pocket warm a fraction of a degree, which is my body being dramatic, not the metal being anything.\n\nAfter, I go to Rocket\u2019s kennel and sit outside it like a supplicant. He is lying with his bariatric head between his paws and his eyes look like someone took amber and added honey and smoke. He gets up and presses his forehead against the bars and I put my hand there and we stand like that for a beat too long. He grumbles a low noise that is not a growl but an opinion. I tell him, I do not own a yard and I do own a soft voice sometimes, and I will try not to make you my experiment, and he licks the place between my index finger and thumb that I always forget is a place.\n\nMonday is light on purpose and heavy on consequence. The board decides to schedule Rocket\u2019s visit for Tuesday, which feels like both too soon and exactly the right amount of time for me to make peace with the fact that I will fail if I measure with someone else\u2019s ruler. I clean the apartment in the way that suggests I am proving something to an invisible auditor. Sprite watches me from the couch with her chin on the armrest, and I tell her that if Rocket comes, I will not let him be the only dog in the room with needs. She yawns huge, shows me the pink cave of her mouth, and collapses into sleep like a small building.\n\nThat night, June brings dinner in a casserole dish that looks like it has fed multitudes of people who wear flannel. We sit at the table because the couch feels too domestic and we are performing something that deserves chairs. The needle lies between salt and pepper like a question. June taps it with the back of her fingernail and it makes a sound that is barely sound. I say, If it is magic, it is the magic that keeps things from unraveling rather than the magic that makes scarves out of nothing. June says, I like both kinds, and I think that is why people tell her their secrets without meaning to.\n\nBefore I sleep, I put my hand on the crate and whisper to Sprite, who is awake with her eyes open just enough to be ready and asleep enough to not have to admit she cares. I tell her that tomorrow another dog will come into the room she has decided is an idea worth keeping. I tell her that I will not break the rules she is knitting under her ribs. I tell her that whatever happens I will not ask her to be an afterthought. My mouth is soft when I say it, but not because I am trying. The needle on the nightstand stares at the ceiling and tells the light where to go. The building hums the way old apartments hum, and maybe that is the only kind of spell that works in a place like this. The cold beyond the glass lines up to be checked at the door in the morning, and I sleep with my hand open, as if I am ready to hold whatever comes and to let it go if that is the kinder thing.Tuesday begins with the sound of ice giving up its grip on the eaves in infinitesimal increments, a slow dripping that is more suggestion than weather. I get up before the alarm out of a courtesy to possibility. Sprite lifts her head when my feet hit the floor and considers whether I am the kind of person who might move a mountain before coffee. I tell her we\u2019re not moving mountains, only making room. She blinks and rearranges herself into a loaf, which is as close as she comes to trust when she hasn\u2019t been fully introduced to the day. I put the kettle on because my body believes in steam, and I put the needle in my pocket because my mind believes in totems even when it pretends not to.\n\nThe apartment looks like it has been staged by someone who understands story and resents it. The crate sits with its door open, a home that does not ask too much. The rug is anchored under the coffee table to keep it from becoming a slipstream. The bowls are in their corner like punctuation marks waiting for a sentence. I take stock of leashes, of treats, of the small jar of paw balm that says winter will not win without a fight. I rehearse in my head the sequence I learned in training videos and from Katy\u2019s cheerful competence: outside first, parallel walk to shake the electricity out of the air, then inside with gates, with choices, with advantages arranged. If I can plan a client\u2019s expectations, I can plan a dog\u2019s.\n\nJune arrives with weather on her cheeks and a grocery bag with a logo that implies someone cares about ink. She brings coffee from the place she insists tastes like forgiveness and a roll of blue painter\u2019s tape for reasons she refuses to reveal until the reveal is satisfying. She puts the cup in my hand and touches the needle in my pocket with two fingers through the fabric, and the motion is so gentle it feels like a superstition of its own. \u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d she says, and I believe her because she has a way of making readiness feel like a cardigan\u2014practical, cozy, knit a stitch at a time.\n\nKaty texts that they are parking, and I say words to Sprite as if each one is padding for the hard parts. The first knock is more a suggestion than a demand, and then a second, as if the knocker knows that people play games with their own doorways. When I open, winter comes inside on Rocket\u2019s coat. Katy has that look of a person trying to convince a situation to stay inside its lines, and Gus carries enthusiasm like a lantern. Rocket recognizes me with his whole face and then his whole body, an equation resolved with a single variable. Sprite recognizes the change in air pressure and turns into a shadow.\n\nWe do the outside first because rules exist to make room for exceptions. The four of us and two dogs parade down the stairwell as if practicing for a domestic comedy I would never agree to be in. Rocket descends with intent, not reckless but convinced. Sprite measures each step for treachery and then willfully steps into it anyway. On the landing we meet the twin mothers, wearing the kind of coordinated parkas that suggest a memorandum. They pause to give us the look that lives in many mothers\u2019 eyes\u2014protective curiosity\u2014and then one of them says, \u201cGood luck,\u201d in a tone that suggests she might, grudgingly, be rooting for the home team. Mrs. Barlow\u2019s door opens a crack as if the building itself is a mouth, and she gives me a nod from inside as if to say, We are all witnesses.\n\nThe world outside has decided to glitter in that insolent way it does when light hits a thousand small facets of cold. We do the parallel walk around the block, a choreography of alignment and relief. Rocket flicks looks at me as if he understands we can transact attention, and when passerby knees appear he chooses me against everything else, which is both flattering and a trap. Sprite stays on my left like a mouse that has decided to be a small horse. She glances at Rocket with the kind of sideways gaze that says I am collecting data to be used later, probably against you.\n\nOn Nicollet, a skateboarder appears the way trouble always appears\u2014sudden, loud, built out of someone else\u2019s joy. Rocket stiffens the way a noun stiffens in a sentence, ready to do something you will later have to excuse. I say his name with a low vowel as if it were a pillow. He flicks his eyes to me and then back to the board as if asking permission to dislike it, and I pay him for the glance with a bit of dehydrated liver that forms the basis of at least three religions in this neighborhood. Sprite tucks herself behind my calf, body making itself into a pencil and then an eraser. I breathe in a way I hope translates to we are trees. The skateboarder disappears and the air remembers how to be air.\n\nBack upstairs, June puts strips of blue tape on the floor like fault lines. \u201cThis is for us,\u201d she says. \u201cVisual cues are as much for people as they are for dogs.\u201d She creates a Z of space between kitchen and living room so that Rocket can occupy one edge and Sprite can occupy the other and neither has to own the middle. I appreciate the geometry of it more than I will admit. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says, \u201cdoorways are treaties. Let\u2019s sign them with our mouths.\u201d She means talk low and look away and make everything seem like something that happens because that is the way of the world, not because we demand it.\n\nRocket enters as if the room owes him an introduction. He beelines to the rope toy, to the couch, to my bookshelf and sniffs the spines as if selecting a life. Sprite chooses the rectangle of blue tape nearest the crate and sets her ribs against it like a barrier she invented. I stay by the sink, gravity for hire. When Rocket\u2019s nose finds the coffee table, he pauses at the needle as all creatures eventually do around small objects that contain a question. He noses it with the care of a thief checking for a tripwire. Then he does the thing Rocket does when his mouth wants to understand the world\u2014he uses it.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I say, not loud, a comma not a period. I step closer without stepping into, and I trade him a sliver of Mrs. Barlow\u2019s sanctioned organ for the unearned metal. Rocket thinks about justice for exactly two beats and then opens his jaw. The needle drops into my palm with that soft clink metal makes when it is relieved, and Rocket receives the heart and shifts his loyalty accordingly. \u201cGood man,\u201d Gus says, to me or to the dog, and June laughs without making a sound because the exchange is so simple and so complicated at once.\n\nKaty watches in that way she does where her approval is a small lamp. \u201cYou have good timing,\u201d she says. \u201cThat matters more than almost everything.\u201d She looks at Sprite and at my body angled soft in her direction and at Rocket slowly lowering himself into a down on a rug he would like to claim but will not today. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to rush this,\u201d she adds, but she is saying it to the air and the board and the story we keep telling ourselves about how patience is something we own when it is something that owns us.\n\nWe spend an hour in the kind of company that looks easy and is not. We do turns at the water bowl. We practice trading what is not ours to give. We let Sprite look and then look away. June narrates the good the way people narrate a sunrise to children who will not remember the first one they saw but will remember the shape of the voice. Rocket is mouthy in ways that can be redirected; Sprite is brave in increments that make my chest a little tight. When Rocket leans into my knee, my hand finds his chest in that spot where praise becomes a kind of map.\n\nWhen the hour is done, Katy gathers leashes with the elegance of a person who has done this five hundred times and still believes in it. \u201cI\u2019m going to propose a foster-to-adopt for Rocket,\u201d she says, which is a sentence braided out of compromise and hope. \u201cTwo weeks. Sprite can stay through the weekend if that works. Then we bring them both into the shelter for a meet on neutral ground and see whether Rocket comes back here with you Monday night. I want the board to see you managing a transition, not just a moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of moving parts,\u201d I say, because stating the obvious makes people feel invited into the logic. \u201cI can make each part small.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all there is,\u201d she says, which is either wisdom or a plea. \u201cWe\u2019ll check in daily. If anyone\u2019s nervous, we change shape.\u201d She leans closer as she clips Rocket\u2019s leash to his collar. \u201cYou\u2019re good at the between,\u201d she adds. \u201cNot everyone is.\u201d\n\nAfter they leave, the air writes an equation it expects me to solve: one dog and one person and one empty space that still holds the outline of something larger. Sprite comes to sniff the place where Rocket\u2019s body pressed the rug and then lies down there as if trying on someone else\u2019s coat. The blue tape remains, an artificial border that has already taught us something. I peel up one corner and the static crackles satisfyingly. June slides the rest up in clean lengths, winding them around two fingers to create a roll that looks enough like a galaxy to make me smile.\n\n\u201cYou did well,\u201d she says, which is risky only if you assume I do not need to know when I do. \u201cYou didn\u2019t rush. You let your face be what your voice promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI almost wanted to be seen,\u201d I say, and the room accepts the confession like an old couch bearing fresh weight. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd sensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a secret,\u201d she says, and then she startles herself with the declarative, cheeks flushing as if she had been caught arguing with a priest. \u201cSorry. That sounded like a banner I knitted with my feelings. It\u2019s just\u2014sometimes people write quiet onto you like a diagnosis and forget that quiet is also an instrument.\u201d\n\nWe take Sprite out again because the world keeps happening even when you think you\u2019ve had a day. The stairwell smells like wet wool and someone\u2019s spicy soup. On the landing, Mrs. Barlow is arranging a pot of something by her door as if spontaneous charity could be left at thresholds like packages. She sees Sprite and puts a hand over her chest as if to keep her heart from running down the hall. \u201cYou met the comet,\u201d she says, and I nod. \u201cHe\u2019ll chew your dictionaries and then spell apology with the bits,\u201d she adds, which is both warning and poem. \u201cYou looked like the sort of woman who keeps sharp things out when necessary. I was not wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the nicest way anyone has called me careful,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re trying on a foster-to-adopt. There are\u2026 steps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere always are,\u201d she says. \u201cYards are ideas. Doors are real. You make a door he understands, you don\u2019t need a fence.\u201d Her little dog chooses that moment to sneeze as if in agreement, and Sprite wags twice in the restrained way of the newly prudent.\n\nWe make it to Loring under a sky that can\u2019t decide if it is thin or thick. The pond is a memory of water under a skin of light. Sprite attempts to read the wind the way a literate person reads a menu at a restaurant where all the dishes have foreign names and domestic ingredients. I keep my voice low and let her choose how far to go, which is farther than I would have bet in the bet I never placed. A man in a bright orange knit hat passes and says to his phone, \u201cIf they fire Jerry, I\u2019ll eat my socks,\u201d as if the socks had been asked to weigh in, and I think of June\u2019s basket of wool like a pantry.\n\nThat evening holds its breath the way evenings do when the day has been too full of edges. I make a simple dinner that turns the kitchen into a room instead of an exhibit. Sprite curls on the rug, uncoiling now and then to check the borders for leaks. The needle sits on the table near the salt and the notebook and the candle I never light because scent feels like a lie in rooms that have to hold too many truths. When I touch the needle, it is just metal. When I hold it longer, it is still metal. There are kinds of magic that only work if you don\u2019t try to turn them into a tool.\n\nAt nine, the building\u2019s fire alarm shrieks the way a god would if gods resorted to human devices. The sound becomes an organism and enters my ears with purpose. Sprite levitates without leaving the ground. I put one hand on the crate and the other on the counter and say her name in the voice I saved for what if. The hall erupts with concerned feet and pajamaed legs and the smell of someone\u2019s burnt idea. I clip Sprite\u2019s leash with the movement of a person who has practiced clips in rooms that were not on fire. We step into the corridor and join the procession.\n\nOn the stairs, Mr. Thirty-Something With the Lab appears without his lab, eyebrows in their own emergency. He says, \u201cIt\u2019s just a false one, building\u2019s old,\u201d and then winces because that sentence always precedes the day it isn\u2019t. The twin mothers corral two small humans who are delighted to be outside beneath the midnight stadium of alarm. Mrs. Barlow has her robe tightened and her small dog under her arm again, an accessory no one planned but everyone understands. We congregate in the lobby like species who forgot they are supposed to hate crowds. Someone carries a goldfish bowl as if you can evacuate water.\n\nSprite shakes under my hand as if it is in conversation with what the noise believes. I crouch and put my palm on the side of her neck and talk like the heaviest blanket. There is a moment when the sound shifts molecules and you think maybe this is how I begin being the person who cannot hold. Then it drops, or maybe I do. Either way, the alarm hiccups and then changes to a lower, sulkier pitch, and the building staff emerges with apologies and a sheet of paper with instructions printed on it that no one will read later. We go back up as a people who have shared something stupid and therefore feel intimate.\n\nBack in the apartment, I give Sprite one of the hearts because Mrs. Barlow\u2019s weird wisdom is a path even when the lights have been rude. Sprite takes it and then lays down right at the threshold between kitchen and living room, occupying the liminal on purpose as if to claim her agency. The needle lies on the table and I put my fingers on it without asking it to do anything at all. It is cool, then less so. If it holds light, it only holds a little, the way a ring remembers a hand.\n\nWednesday is a mercy, the kind of day that looks like a straight line. I work and walk and repeat until repetition\u2019s cousin shows up and calls itself comfort. The scarf June is knitting has grown enough to drape, and when she sits here its length slides over her knee and onto the floor and pools in a way that reminds me of water that has seen heat. She wears the needle in her hair again, cap glinting like an idea. \u201cFisherman\u2019s rib is for the patient and the stubborn,\u201d she says, eyes on her work. \u201cYou only see it when you pull it, when the fabric has to show you what it\u2019s been hiding.\u201d\n\nIn the afternoon, Katy texts that the board likes a good narrative and I am developing one. I send a picture of Sprite asleep with her face smushed against the crate tray as if trying to see through plastic. Katy responds with a heart and then a sentence that makes something in me warm: They are coming around. When you are the kind of person whose job is to remove friction from systems, it is disconcerting and pleasurable to be told that your existence itself is grease for the squeak.\n\nThursday throws its shoulder into the door and entrances with wind and a sky that has turned theatrical. Snow that is not snow yet tries on shapes above the rooftops like a woman in a dressing room unsure anyone deserves to see her in this dress. I take Sprite to the dog park early and she sniffs all the posts as if reading the morning paper. The shepherd is there again with his ball and a woman I have not seen before, who throws in the unshowy way of someone whose body remembers work. \u201cYou\u2019re the Rocket lady,\u201d she says without preface, and I nod because categories travel faster than facts. \u201cKaty talks about you like you are a can opener,\u201d she adds. \u201cIn a good way. Opens things without cutting anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put that on my resume,\u201d I say, and then I realize that I mean it. When Rocket comes here next, and when we do the exchange at the shelter, and when the board continues to watch and pretend they aren\u2019t, I will hold that image. A useful tool. A safe edge.\n\nFriday dawns in gray wool and modesty. The building coughs itself awake and Sprite yawns and shows me two inches of careful tongue. I intend to keep the day\u2019s temperature gentle, but the world is not waiting for me. At ten, Katy calls with an ask that knocks a piece off my internal arrangement. \u201cWe took Rocket to a family in St. Anthony for a meet this morning,\u201d she says, diplomatically. \u201cThey have a child who is all elbows and hope. Rocket\u2026 decided elbows are sometimes toys. Minor mouthing. No harm. Dad panicked. He\u2019s back in his kennel, and he\u2019s escalated. I hate that word. Can I bring him over in an hour, just to let him regulate in a place that is not made of echoes?\u201d\n\nI look at Sprite, who is chewing on the corner of a blanket as if she is excising an unfortunate design choice, and I calibrate. \u201cBring him,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll make new echoes.\u201d\n\nWhen Rocket arrives, his eyes are glassy in that way dogs get when they have been asked to be eighteen different things in seventy minutes. He plants his feet in my entryway as if to ground the house against weather. I set the scene with food on the floor to scatter, with a gate slid into the hallway to make turn-taking a physical reality, with my voice already wearing its cardigan. Sprite watches from the crate with the door open because choice is a kind of medicine. Rocket paces the blue tape that isn\u2019t there anymore and then lies down on the rug that is, and the act is so deliberate it feels performative. June is here because she is always here when the day could go either way, and she sits with her knitting and her stable breath and her single needle that glints and then does not.\n\nWe break the time into pieces and do not ask anyone to hold the whole hour in their mouth. Rocket puts his head under my hand three times and each time I say nothing and each time the saying nothing feels like a sentence. When he rises fast at a sound in the hall, I say his name and step back and he steps into my step, and the little choreography we do is ours. Sprite comes forward to sniff his flank and then steps away before her brain can tell her she is brave, and I let that be the victory. The kitchen smells like chicken and wool and resolute winter, and for a second I want to put the whole moment in amber.\n\nKaty sits with her hands between her knees as if to keep them from betraying her. \u201cThe board will want to see this,\u201d she says, and I hear both regret and relief. \u201cThey want to know he can read the room.\u201d She watches Rocket glance at my face and then at the world and then back to my face and she nods. \u201cHe\u2019s learning subtitles,\u201d she says, and my mouth makes a smile that is not for show.\n\nIn the late afternoon, after Rocket has gone back to his kennel smelling like my floor, the sky finally makes good on its threat and releases a sheet of snow that turns the city into a footnote. I take Sprite out into it and she digs her nose in and snorts like a small horse in clover. The cold operates like a bureaucracy: thorough, relentless, filling every gap. We walk the loop and Sprite looks back at me every six steps as if to confirm I am still a fixed point. I tell her in a voice I believe that I am. If I keep saying it, perhaps I will always be.\n\nSaturday is Butter and yarn and the version of the world where people decide to be human together on purpose. June and I sit by the window and watch the constant small theater of people deciding to be inside or out. The scarf has grown and when she wraps it around my neck to test the drape, it covers my collarbones like it was made in the shape of my reluctance and my wanting. The needle rides her hair like a hairpin that knows things about winter. \u201cI think I can finish this before you sign anything official,\u201d she says. \u201cThat way, if you have to cry, you can do it into something designed to absorb.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t cry on cue,\u201d I say, and then I realize the cue is so often my own, and that makes me quieter than I was a minute ago. \u201cThank you,\u201d I add, because gratitude is a language I try to practice even when my mouth would rather be precise than soft.\n\nBack home, Sprite naps with her mouth slightly open, dream-panting for whatever it is dogs chase in sleep that is not us. I clean as if the board might fall from the ceiling and inspect my baseboards. I sweep up three long strands of June\u2019s hair\u2014stowaways woven from the needle to our days\u2014and a small curl of blue tape that escaped its planet. The refrigerator hums in the tone of a thing that has decided to live forever and probably won\u2019t. The needle sits in the light and takes it but does not hoard.\n\nSunday dawns apocalyptic and then remembers itself. The snow plows conduct their slow dragons outside my window, and I make a list because lists are how I take myself seriously. On it is: return Sprite Monday morning for neutral ground, bring hearts and a sense of humor, do not apologize for not being a yard, remember that doors are real. June texts me a picture of the needle beside a cup of tea and a lemon, the cap\u2019s rose catching lamplight and pretending it invented it. She writes: today we rest our wrists, and I think of all the tendons under my skin associating themselves with a dog\u2019s name they haven\u2019t been told yet belongs here.\n\nMonday is transit and tremble and that antiseptic smell that says, We are going to try to do good and will not always know how. I take Sprite into the shelter with a calm I borrowed from someone else and then made mine. She walks in and flattens a little at the threshold and then remembers about biscuits and takes one like a woman remembering she once loved salt. Rocket is brought out with the performative patience of a very smart child at a museum. We do the dance. We circle, we stop, we do small noses and small nods. Katy looks at me the way a teacher looks at a student who has chosen the right formula without showing her work.\n\nThe board has faces I know and faces I don\u2019t, each holding a different story they tell themselves about who will be good for whom. The twins\u2019 moms are not on the board, but somehow their opinion is present in the air like perfume. Mrs. Barlow is not on the board, but her wisdom about hums and hearts has made a nest in the back of my throat. June stands near the volunteer table like an understudy who learned all the lines and never needed to. Gus holds Rocket\u2019s leash and hums something tuneless under his breath that turns into courage when we decide to call it that.\n\nI do not make a speech because speeches belong to people who need to be heard more than they need to do. Instead, I kneel and show my hand to Rocket and show my side to Sprite and wait until each chooses me in their small way. Rocket\u2019s nose presses the webbing between my thumb and forefinger with that seriousness of a creature who knows about dark rooms and exits. Sprite leans against my calf like a comma. The room watches until it decides it has seen enough. Katy clears her throat in the quiet the way people do when they are about to alter someone\u2019s immediate future.\n\n\u201cWe propose,\u201d she says, and the word is so full I feel my fingers go still. \u201cFoster-to-adopt for Rocket. Transition today, two weeks with check-ins, formal adoption pending continued suitability. Sprite will move to a foster who has her same frequency to avoid bounce. Mara has demonstrated management, intention, and the sort of calm that is not indifference. The board will sign,\u201d she adds, glancing at faces that have been written into this outcome. \u201cIf anyone has an objection, now is the time, and you must bring evidence, not vibe.\u201d\n\nNo one brings anything but relief. The relief looks like people letting their shoulders drop in unison. It looks like Gus smiling so hard his beanie tries to leave his head of its own accord. It looks like a woman in the corner with cat-eye glasses and that purposeful red mouth writing something on a paper form with a pen that leaves a trail like a small river. It looks like me standing because my knees remember how.\n\nThere are logistics that happen next and they all have the satisfying clatter of plates being stacked in the right cupboard. Katy hands me a folder with tabs and the kind of language lawyers like and the kind of white space graphic designers consider generous. Gus claps Rocket on the flank and says, \u201cBe good,\u201d and Rocket looks at him like that word is interesting but not definitive. Sprite is handed to a woman with soft hands and a voice built like a porch, and she says to me, \u201cWe\u2019re just going to borrow her heart for a while,\u201d and I nod because lending is an adult skill I don\u2019t get enough credit for practicing. June squeezes my arm and says nothing because what is there.\n\nWhen we get home, Rocket enters like a problem set I asked for and received. He does a brisk circle of everything and then sits as if he invented it. I remove the leash with ceremony I do not mock. He looks at me and I look at him and there is a moment in which our bodies are a recipe. I put the needle on the table between the plant and the notebook and the small jar of balm for pads that will need it, and it sits there and hums with the building and the winter and the fact of a dog who is not an experiment and not an idea and not a symbol. He is Rocket, which is a ridiculous name and also not, and he puts his head on my knee and then removes it because he suspects he is allowed to do that whenever he chooses, and he wants to be right.\n\nThe evening is practice. I make an aisle of patience between the kitchen and the couch and we walk it back and forth until our feet know the boards. I scatter food on the rug to slow a mouth that has decided urgency is a virtue and then I watch urgency remember that it can be put down without being lost. I let him watch me do nothing for ten minutes, then fifteen, then a stretch that feels like a gift to both of us. The wind slaps the window with an open palm and then tries again as if the city owes it money. The refrigerator hums, and the needle hums along, and I decide to stop deciding whether I am imagining it, because imagining is one of my higher functions and it deserves work, too.\n\nWhen June leaves, she pauses in the doorway and looks at Rocket with the heavy regard she reserves for creatures that have made a case for themselves without words. \u201cBe kind to my friend,\u201d she says to him, which is an unfair assignment and a good one. He looks at her with the amber intelligence he carries like a secret, and then he looks at me. I look back and my face tells on me. It says, I am here. It says, We will walk when the cold says no. It says, I can be a can opener. It says nothing at all, too, because the heart of your ribbing is your intention and mine is becoming a garment I can finally put on without checking the mirror more than once.\n\nThat night, when Rocket curls near the couch with a breath that smells like what dogs smell like when they have been asked to make a life in a place that smells like people, I put my hand on the floor, fingers open, palm cool. He shifts a fraction to put his rib into the space. The needle on the table catches the lamplight like it did the day we found it and then gives it back in a slightly altered shape. If it is magic, it is not the kind that turns straw into gold. It is the kind that keeps fiber from slipping, a small anchor against the weight of intention. The wind rattles the glass, and the building answers with its hum\u2014the same one people in this place have slept to and cursed and learned to love because it is the sound of the world continuing without our permission.\n\nI sleep in a way that remembers without rehearsing. In the gray where the city has not yet put on its voice, Rocket shifts and groans the small groan of a creature who has found a different answer for what it means to be safe. I reach for the needle on the table and do not touch it. My hand hangs in the air and makes a shape I recognize from other lives I\u2019ve tried\u2014reaching without needing, offering without insisting. When morning comes, the cold will still be itself, ambitious and unsentimental. We will put on boots. We will put on courtesy. We will open a door. We will walk anyway.The first week with Rocket rubs itself into the apartment the way a new scent insists on being part of the narrative. He is mouthy in the morning and philosophical by afternoon, a dog who decides each sound in the hallway deserves a footnote but not a war. I portion the day into gates and games and pauses because that is how my brain forgives both of us. At seven we step into the tundra together and I show him where the city keeps its corners. At noon we scatter food into the rug so his urgency has something granular to argue with. At four we practice doorways the way some people practice scales, my hand hovering on the knob and his body remembering that stillness is an action. There is a click that happens in him when a rule makes sense, and each time I hear it I feel something in me loosen the way a jar lid does when you run it under hot water even though the internet swears it\u2019s a myth.\n\nHe learns my apartment as if he has been hired to draw a map. He has strong opinions about the bathmat and none at all about the couch until he does. He tries to memorize my hands. I try to memorize his breath. When the building hiccups\u2014a radiator-esque shudder in the vent, a neighbor finding hilarity at a volume usually reserved for theater\u2014he lifts his head and asks me whether this will be a thing. I say, Not for us, and because I make my voice a soft bridge, he walks across it. The needle sits on the table or in my pocket depending on how superstitious I need to be, which is to say, more than before and less than people who talk to crystals in the cleansing aisle at the co-op. When I roll it between my fingers, the metal is ordinary until I stop demanding. After that, it is still ordinary, but I notice the way my skin recognizes weight and chill and the small hum of being alive enough to hold something at all.\n\nWork tries to be offended at my focus and fails because I am still the person who answers email with an economy that borders on the athletic. I take calls and redirect clients and move commas into places that keep sentences from tripping over their own confidence. When someone on the Bergstrom account asks if we can \u201cspin\u201d a delay, I say, We can sequence truth into palatable portions, which is an answer that makes our CFO sound proud in public and worried in private. Rocket sleeps under the table with his body touching the side of my foot in a way that would be possessive if it weren\u2019t so precise. When he dreams, his paws do the ghost of running and his lips move around the name of whatever he was before this, and I look at the needle glinting beside my mouse and think about names as instructions and invitations.\n\nKaty checks in via text with the brevity of a person who knows what she needs to know and would rather be mopping than typing. Her questions are plain: countersurfing, mouthiness, triggers, appetite, elimination, energy after five p.m. I answer without theater and with enough detail to be useful. I say, He is a man who needs a job and I am an employer who understands onboarding, and she sends back a line of clapping hands that looks ridiculous and feels earned. Sprite\u2019s foster sends two photos and a caption that says, She is playing more and eating in a straight line, which is the sort of sentence that, if you don\u2019t know dogs, sounds like nothing and, if you do, sounds like prayer.\n\nThe second Tuesday after Rocket moves in the world does a Minnesota thing where the sky decides to be a lid and the wind commits to coming from exactly the direction of your face no matter which way you turn. I put a salve on Rocket\u2019s paw pads with a flourish that makes him look at me as if I have given him jewelry. He licks it off with careful consideration and then looks at me as if to ask if this ointment was designed for taste, and I tell him not everything needs to be a success in every axis. We go out anyway to the part of Loring Park where the snow piles at the corners like patient beasts. A squirrel makes a bad decision on a branch above us and then corrects it in a manner that would inspire a triathlon coach. Rocket locks into stillness that is not silence. His body becomes a sentence that ends with an exclamation point no one else wants to read out loud.\n\nThis is where I learn to make my voice different than my hands. I do not tighten the leash because I have watched enough videos to know what that says. I plant my feet without staking, and I let the line between us become slack enough to be honest. Rocket flicks his eyes to that slack as if it is a new dialect, then to my knee as if it speaks, then back to the squirrel whose tail calls him a liar about his restraint. I whisper leave it as if it were a bedtime story and pay him for the glance with something that used to be a fish. He takes the fish and does not break the world. A man in a snowmobile suit with a face like a surprised tomato says, Good boy, to the dog and then to me as if the compliment can be transferred, and I accept both as if I earned them, which, today, I did.\n\nJune obsesses over the scarf with the kind of cheer that is better than zeal. She brings it when she comes, wrapped around her neck until she decides Rocket has forgotten that textiles can be not-toys. She knits around him the way water moves around a rock that is trying to remain completely itself. The fisherman\u2019s rib grows like low tide, ridges and rests. Sometimes she counts under her breath and the numbers form the outline of a lullaby. Sometimes she tells me about her day at the co-op where a woman demanded that the oranges apologize for being from far away, and the way the barista at Butter has decided to learn the names of everyone who braves this part of winter in a hat that covers only the top third of their ears. She says this city is a competition between people who will out-stubborn the cold and people who find ways to sneak warmth into corners it doesn\u2019t belong, and I tell her she only likes competitions she knows she can win.\n\nThe needle becomes a member of this household in a way that would embarrass a rational inventory. It travels from the table to my pocket to the dish by the door where keys and sharp things live. June wears it in her hair when she\u2019s here and sometimes, when she is not, I hold it and think it knows which one of us is the witch and which one is the experiment. If it does an occult thing, it does it in that quiet register where heating vents mutter at two a.m. and refrigerators confess that they are tired. Twice I think I feel a warmth that is not my hand\u2019s doing when I am the only one awake and Rocket comes and puts his chin on the edge of the couch and breathes in my direction as if reminding me that oxygen is a communal act.\n\nMy mother calls in a burst of winter daylight, the way she does when boredom meets concern in the middle of an article she did not finish. She wants to know whether I have changed my mind about Netflix, whether my building is salt-friendly, whether I am using a prong collar that a friend\u2019s friend swears saved her marriage, whether water left on a stove unattended can cause the sort of systemic issues a person sees on TikTok if she is not careful about following young women who speak with a conviction that does not seem to be attached to facts. I tell her my collar is leather and intention. I tell her I stand in the kitchen when I boil water because the kettle deserves company the way a newborn does. I tell her that Rocket\u2019s mouth belongs to both of us and to neither of us depending on who is watching and whether they own a board seat.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean,\u201d she asks, and I think of her thumbs on links, of her faith in the headline and her skepticism of me, and I say, It means I am doing fine. She hesitates and then says, I read a study about dogs increasing cardiovascular health in women over forty, and I say, I\u2019m not over forty, and she says, I know, and I hear inside it the small apology of a person who doesn\u2019t know how to be proud without sounding like an insurance brochure. When we hang up, I look at Rocket and say, Today you\u2019ve made me a data set, and he sits as if to acknowledge his role in my longevity.\n\nThe trainer arrives on a Thursday when the world has decided to be glass. Her name is Alina and she is slender in the way of willow branches capable of withstanding a storm. She brings a pouch that smells like a decision, and she looks at me the way people trained to teach look at people trained to pretend they don\u2019t care about approval. She asks for my philosophy and I say, Intention, consistency, exchange, and she nods as if we have agreed on a tax rate. We spend an hour reinforcing Rocket\u2019s ability to choose me against the thrill of the hallway, the flirtation of the trash can, the myth of the window as portal. Alina says, He\u2019s a mouth on legs, he needs a job he can hold in his teeth, and I buy rope toys that are not barnyard animals so he will not feel like he is chewing on narratives we do not subscribe to.\n\nWe practice impulse control with a game called It\u2019s Your Choice that sounds like a dangerous party and is actually an introduction to consent. Rocket learns that hands closed are opportunities and hands open are compliments, that looking away gets you more than lunging forward, that sometimes the treat is the fact that I waited with you and did not rush your thinking. When he flubs it, which he does because he is a mammal and impatient when hungry, I take a breath that is not dramatic and try again. When he knocks it out of the park, Alina\u2019s eyebrows do a small dance of satisfaction and I feel something like heat behind my ribs that I do not name because naming makes me want to run from the room.\n\nThere is a night where the building decides to go dark and stay that way longer than \u201coops\u201d usually lasts. The heating is as stalwart as our landlord\u2019s emails can make it, but the lights leave until the emergency ones remember their job. The hallway becomes a shadow with boundaries. The apartment turns into a texture you feel with shin and hip. Rocket takes the lack of light as a puzzle that is mostly corners. He bumps a chair leg and discovers it is not a threat. He sniffs the bottom of the bookshelf and finds a secret stash of pine dust I did not realize had lodged there, and he sneezes like a man who has offended himself. I gather candles like a person who has accidentally become an ancestor. June appears with a thermos of soup and a headlamp and the scarf half-done, and she plants herself on my floor as if she has claimed squatter\u2019s rights on my good intentions.\n\nWe eat by the kind of light that makes faces look kinder, and June tells me more than I know about the needle. She took it back to Fixations and held it up to the cat-eye teacher like a small offering to a sensible goddess. The woman squinted at the rose cap and said, \u201cThat\u2019s older than it looks and younger than it pretends,\u201d which is a sentence June has been waiting to say back to me all evening. The teacher ran her fingernail along the shaft and said there is a story about a pair like that, a set made in a little workshop in Duluth by a woman whose husband was lost on Superior in a storm with a name and a song. Supposedly she cast the needles out of scrap collected from the docks and filed them smooth with grief and salt. People said they held stitches that wanted to escape. People said they warmed under a certain kind of hand. People say a lot of things about women who keep their lives as if they were tools.\n\nJune laughs and tells me not to marry myself to all of it because legend is a thing that happens when facts get tired and feelings refuse to go to bed. Still, when she passes the needle from one hand to the other in the candlelight, it glows like a practical thing that knows it is being watched. Rocket chooses that moment to lay his head on my foot and sigh the sigh that feels like a calendar turning. The power comes back with the sound of a city remembering itself, and the light is rude after the soft. The candle sputters, and the needle goes back to being metal on a table between a plant that thrives despite and a jar of salve that smells like herbs and hope.\n\nIn the daylight after, I stand with Rocket in the dog park and talk to the man with the lab, whose name turns out to be Colin and whose headband choice tells me he has accepted that ears are not masculine or feminine but simply cold. He tells me he works nights at a hospital where people come in with problems that feel like end-of-world until they are solved with a warm blanket and an apology, and I tell him I help people give themselves permission to change their minds and then call it strategy. He throws the ball and his lab returns it like an apology accepted. We practice recall with Rocket while Sprite\u2019s foster texts me a picture of her asleep between a child\u2019s feet, her paws tucked like hands. I tell Rocket that being loved by a stranger is not a crime, and he wags like he understands both grammar and grace.\n\nThere is a day when Rocket decides the vacuum is, in fact, a demon, and we negotiate a peace treaty that involves turning it on in another room and paying him for breathing like he doesn\u2019t want to call an attorney. There is a morning where he gets the zooms so violently the rug tries to leave the building by itself, and I laugh in the way that uses the part of the stomach I try not to remember exists. There is an afternoon where I cry without permission while watching a video of an old man being surprised with a puppy, and Rocket comes and puts his head on my lap and then removes it when I say, Enough, as if he understands that kindness is sometimes the space between us and sometimes the weight.\n\nMrs. Barlow becomes a source of advice and protein as if she has been waiting all winter for someone to take seriously her inventory of the heart. She knocks at civilized hours with small containers of gizzards as if she is collecting my refrigerator\u2019s gratitude. She tells me stories about her husband and the hum that he left, about the way he would stand in rooms he\u2019d built and listen before he let anyone enter because a building tells you what you made it into if you give it a minute. I think of my father then, and the way he stood in a garage full of pine and Danish oil and believed in straight lines because they did not require anyone else to consent. He liked dogs the way people like coffee\u2014ritual, necessary, not particularly interesting as individuals. When I was eight I made a leash out of a shoelace for a neighbor\u2019s cat and declared that I would walk her; the cat shredded my plan and my forearm with the calm of a creature uninterested in metaphors. My father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t make a companion out of something that does not choose you,\u201d and then he said, \u201cYou can make a system out of anything if you\u2019re stubborn,\u201d which probably explains how he loved us.\n\nThe board does not vanish when the adoption move from conditional to almost. They like updates with an air of clinical affection, as if they once lost a dog to the very thing they did not notice and have decided the noticing now will save everyone else. We send them videos of Rocket choosing me in banal situations: the doorbell, the clatter of a pot, the crackle of the radio when NPR decides to let jazz in before dinner. Katy calls me on a Sunday morning with, \u201cThe board is ready to stop pretending they are in charge of something they cannot own,\u201d which is one of her ways of saying that she will put the adoption form in my hand on Tuesday if nothing catastrophic happens between now and then. I tell her that I do not do catastrophe as a hobby and she laughs as if it is healthy to lie to one another sometimes.\n\nOn Monday a coyote moves like a whisper across the far edge of the park as if it is a rumor invented by winter. Rocket stands so still I think he has become part of the rail. In that breath where instinct and training meet, the leash is a suggestion and my voice is a bridge. I say his name and it is a word that could be anything, and he looks at me and the coyote becomes the end of someone else\u2019s sentence. We stand together long enough for me to memorize it. The coyote glances our way once, bored by our civility, and then disappears into the kind of brush city designers pretend doesn\u2019t harbor anything wild. I do not tell Rocket he is a good boy because the praise feels like the wrong currency. I touch his neck and then remove my hand and we walk home and the needle in my pocket is warm enough to make me think about science and then decide, for once, not to.\n\nThat night I lie on the floor with Rocket because sometimes sitting on a couch makes a room behave like a living room and there are evenings where you need a gymnasium instead. He sprawls with his long legs in ways that defy geometry, his body ridiculous and handsome. I tell him about the board, about signatures, about how paper can be a wedding and how I am not the marrying kind unless you count promises made on Tuesdays. He blinks at me as if he understands more about bureaucracy than he wants to and then sighs the sigh of a creature who is tired of his own bones. The needle sits on the table between the plant and the notebook and the jar of balm, and for a second I do think I see the lamplight bend toward it just the way June swears it does, and then the refrigerator hums and the heat kicks in and the city inhales and exhales and I accept that intention is a garment we knit daily and that sometimes the stitches hold because women somewhere made needles out of grief and metal and courage and said, This is how you keep something from coming undone.\n\nWhen Tuesday comes in wearing ash and the rumor of sun, I put on boots that make me look more practical than I feel and a hat we bought together at a pop-up that existed for exactly four days. June meets me at the shelter because she refuses to let bureaucratic joy be mine alone, and she hands me the scarf in a fold that amounts to ceremony. It is heft and rib and repetition and the kind of softness that makes a face remember it has muscles capable of smile without rehearsal. I wrap it around my neck and it becomes a sentence that ends with a period that is also a promise. Katy puts the form in front of me and a pen in my hand and says, \u201cYou can always say no,\u201d and my mouth does not even pretend to understand. I sign the line that is ridiculous and not, my last name writing itself the way it did on checks I wrote my landlord and letters I never mailed.\n\nThe city is still cold and indifferent when we step back into it with a dog who is now not just practice but fact, and that is good because weather should not be sentimental just because I am. I carry the folder like something that can break even though it is only paper and implication. Rocket looks up at me with his gold-glass eyes and then at the door, which is the real thing in the end. We open it together and the air makes its case against comfort and we say, Noted, and we walk anyway because we have already rehearsed this so many times it would be an insult to our past selves not to. The needle rides in my pocket against the fisherman\u2019s rib like a bit of ore remembering heat, and when we cross Hennepin and the bus hisses and a child points and a woman in a green parka says, \u201cThat\u2019s a handsome creature,\u201d I do not say thank you to only the dog. I say it to the city, to the cold, to the board, to the neighbors who updated their files about me, to June who believes in superstition only when it is useful, to the woman in Duluth who maybe made these needles out of mourning and brass, and to the part of me that was waiting in a hallway weeks ago and learned to make a space exactly the right size and to hold it without shaking.The scarf becomes part of my uniform the way muscle memory becomes part of a movement: unnoticed until absent. I wrap it around my neck in the morning and it tells my face what kind of softness to wear. Rocket comes to check that the scarf hasn\u2019t become an animal, sniffs the wool like it could be a cousin, and then nose-bumps my hand as if to remind me that we have a contract with the day. The needle rides in my pocket like an idea with a weight to it, and occasionally I will forget it entirely until my fingers find it there and everything in me does the small adjustment you do when you realize you\u2019re carrying something breakable and also, somehow, unbreakable. This is how objects train you, gently and then not.\n\nThe week after the signature turns into a rhythm that is not routine so much as a stitched piece with slippage and recovery built in. I learn Rocket\u2019s tells. He gulps air when he is about to decide between impulse and me; his left ear twitches when he is thinking hard about pretending to be taller; he sighs with that theatrical dog exhale when I ask for anything he believes is beneath us. We make a truce with the vacuum. We make a game out of not rushing the door. We make Loring Park ours in increments until the angles of the bridge and the way the birches collect their own shadows become part of the language we speak to each other without saying anything. He picks up a stick the length of a thesis and looks at me like he has taken up sport, and I pay him for dropping it with a bit of salmon that makes his eyes do a religious thing. If this is worship, it is the kind where both worshippers are a little embarrassed by their own sincerity.\n\nJune\u2019s scarf grows in the gaps of my days and travels with her like a tutelary spirit. She wears it at Butter and at Fixations and once, scandalously, to a meeting at the co-op where a man in a fleece vest told her it made her look \u201cvery artisanal,\u201d which she relayed to me with an expression that asked me to invent a polite word for idiot. The needle comes with her, threaded through her hair with the rose cap winking like an eavesdropper, and the two together look more like a set than any of us intended. When she sits at my table, she sometimes takes the needle out of her hair and rolls it on the wood and says, I have a ridiculous suggestion, and because she is June I say, Yes, before she has even finished her breath.\n\n\u201cWe should go to Duluth,\u201d she says, and my brain does an inventory labeled Risk under which it lists: February, highway visibility, the lake\u2019s reputation for collaboration with tragedy, the state patrol\u2019s opinion of my tires, the fact that I once claimed I was allergic to road trips because they ask for a kind of sitting that feels like surrender. June\u2019s eyes are on my face like she is knitting me and this is the row where something complicated slips into rib.\n\n\u201cTo look at water that is pretending to be rock?\u201d I ask, buying time with sarcasm\u2019s small coins.\n\n\u201cTo take this needle to its cousin,\u201d she says, and taps the rose cap on the table lightly enough that the sound is more suggestion than percussion. \u201cThe cat-eye teacher swears there\u2019s a woman in Duluth named Ruth or Roz or possibly Renata\u2014I wrote it down\u2014whose aunt swore up and down she had the mate to this. She runs a shop near the shore that sells mending supplies and whiskey stones and those cards that look like they were printed in 1954. The story about the needles started up there. If we bring it,\u201d she touches the needle the way you touch a friend\u2019s shoulder to move them out of traffic, \u201cmaybe something will feel right. Or maybe we\u2019ll eat pie that tastes like a weather report and come home.\u201d\n\nA trip is a disruption. A disruption is a test and also the thing that shows you what your life is made of when you shake it. Rocket\u2019s seatbelt harness arrives in a cardboard box that has opinions about tape. He sits while I adjust it to his chest and then moves his head left and right like a man in a barbershop who enjoys the attention but not the cape. He tolerates boots in theory and then plucks them off in practice like bad arguments. Mrs. Barlow watches me parade down the hall with treats, leash, bags, spare leash, collapsible water bowl, little packet of coffee for the road as if we are leaving for a week and not a night, and she says, \u201cYou\u2019re packing like a woman who knows love may require a backup plan,\u201d and presses two hearts into my palm as if I could confuse this journey with a blood ritual without her assistance. The twins\u2019 moms meet us at the elevator and offer to bring in packages if anything arrives, and the smaller twin says, \u201cWill the lake be mad?\u201d in the quaver of childhood that holds the truth, and I say, \u201cIt\u2019s not a mood so much as a geography,\u201d which she accepts because children adore questionable metaphors when they come wrapped in certainty.\n\nThe drive north is a corridor of white and sky, a meditation neither of us asked for and both of us accept. Rocket takes the back seat like a man who does not understand why the front is not for all good boys, and then settles with his chin on the armrest as if this gives him the best angle to judge my choices. June narrates the world outside as if it\u2019s a training exercise for us and the landscape. She says, \u201cBirches on the right, field on the left, ghost barn at twelve,\u201d and Rocket lifts his head at ghost as if he has seen one and would like to be consulted before we decide not to stop. The highways are a series of agreements between our tires and a god named Friction. We pass a billboard reminding us that people who speed will die and another telling us that a diner we cannot see has pie the size of regret. We stop in Hinckley for gas and the kind of bathroom break that makes you question how human beings managed before indoor plumbing was a promise. Rocket steps out into the station\u2019s slush and looks around with his whole face like someone dropped him into a novel and forgot to provide a summary of earlier chapters.\n\nBy the time we crest the hill where the lake becomes the horizon\u2019s occupation, my chest does that thing it always does at bodies of water that pretend to be everything at once. Superior lies like a sheet of metal hammered mostly flat and then bent by a force that did not care about flattery. The air shifts temperature in a way that does not feel like permission. The holiday lights strung across Downtown Duluth are tattered and still glowing at two p.m. because that is the sort of city this is in February. The aerial lift bridge flexes itself as if the muscles under its structure can remember summer. I do not tell anyone that this makes me want to cry in a small way that calls for a dark bar and a song about ships.\n\nJune\u2019s directions take us to a storefront painted the green of old glass. Above the door a sign declares, in a font that feels like a handshake, Thread & Tackle, which makes me stupidly happy. Inside it smells like waxed canvas, honey, wood shavings, and the kind of paper that has heard stories. There are bins of darning eggs and odd hooks, little rows of metal clips for unknown uses, candle stubs labeled Storm, and a glass case with thimbles that could belong to saints or seamstresses. June\u2019s needle in my pocket warms the way small things do when you are about to make them part of a plot. The woman behind the counter is gray in the way of driftwood, focused in the way of surgeons, and her name tag says R. Linn in tidy letters like she would enjoy your penmanship if you brought it to her to assess.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a rumor,\u201d June says, because she should always go first when rumors are involved. \u201cSomething about a needle with a rose at the end that belongs to a story that started with a storm. We have one,\u201d she adds, and touches my pocket as if it were a reliquary.\n\nR. Linn lets her face do the minute shift that reads as interest if you come from a city and grudging delight if you come from a town. She says, \u201cMy aunt told me enough stories about that pair to ruin several family dinners,\u201d and motions us closer to the case where the most beautiful useless things live. \u201cSupposedly a woman named Marion\u2014no last name in the version I like\u2014made herself a pair out of scrap and stubbornness after the lake failed to return her man. She used them to knit through a winter that had more endings than beginnings. The needles held everything she couldn\u2019t. When she died, one went to her sister and one went to the neighbor who kept coming by with casseroles that didn\u2019t help. They drifted. People kept losing one and passing the other, as if the pair refused to live together too long. People who believe in magic call them the Duluth Roses and attribute all kinds of nonsense to them: warmth, luck, a way of keeping tension honest. People who believe in grief call them what they are: metal that reminds you of a person who didn\u2019t come home.\u201d\n\nI take the needle from my pocket and lay it on the glass. In this light the rose cap looks more thorn than bloom, more practical than pretty. R. Linn raises an eyebrow in a way that tells me she has decided I am either serious or insufferable. She reaches under the counter and produces a cigar box that once belonged to a man who thought cigars were an identity. Inside, nestled in cotton that has known damp, lies a needle that could be the twin of mine, minus a notch tiny as a bitten nail on the cap\u2019s outer petal. June inhales like she has been waiting to breathe since November. I put our needle next to the one in the cotton, and there is no alchemy, no spark that leaps between them, only the feeling you get when a missing bracket arrives at the end of a line of code.\n\n\u201cMay I?\u201d R. Linn asks, and there is something between curiosity and caution in the request. I nod, and she picks each needle up in turn, like a person measuring weight in their palms who has measured jewels and hammers both. \u201cMy aunt swore if you held one too long you\u2019d dream in the lake\u2019s vocabulary,\u201d she says, and smirks a little so we all know pedigree is not the point. She puts them together, cap to cap, and for a moment a loop of cold sweeps the hairs along my wrist into attention, the way a door opens and winter comes in to look around. It could be the weather sneaking in through the seam of the old windows. It could be that when you expect anything, your body obliges with a fiction it is happy to believe. It could be nothing.\n\nJune holds her hand out for the twin and closes her fingers around it with the reverence she saves for dough rising correctly and babies\u2019 first laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s warmer,\u201d she says, and then, because she is conscientious about not becoming a clich\u00e9, adds, \u201cIt\u2019s probably body heat and the fact that your shop is at seventy-two degrees, which is a sin in February and also a kindness.\u201d She hands it to me and I feel how smooth the shaft is from use, the minute tackiness at the grip from oils that had a name once and now have a story. If there is anything in it beyond metal, it is restraint, that particular Minnesota knack for being magic without being showy.\n\n\u201cAre there rules?\u201d I ask, halfway mocking, halfway the way you ask for instructions when a stranger puts a baby into your arms and walks out of the room.\n\n\u201cNone that don\u2019t sound idiotic when spoken out loud,\u201d R. Linn says. \u201cDon\u2019t break them. Don\u2019t brag about them. Don\u2019t sell them to anyone who calls themselves a collector. Don\u2019t use them to pierce ears. Do your mending. Be stubborn only when it is useful. If you knit with them, knit thick enough to slow your mind down. If you carry one, remember your pocket is not infinite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come to keep it,\u201d June says, as if the needle could be hearing. \u201cWe came to know if our superstition is an orphan.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrphans make their own families,\u201d R. Linn says, and I add her to the list of women I would choose to be in charge of something that would otherwise be ruined by people trying to help. \u201cYou can take this one for a day. Bring it back tomorrow by ten. The lake hates hoarders and people who sleep late.\u201d She wraps the twin in paper that makes a torn-silk sound and hands it to June with the small nod of someone who knows you\u2019ll honor the agreement.\n\nWe go down to the lake because if you are this close and you do not, the city will spit you out. The air is the kind of clean that threatens. The ice makes a sound that is more report than music, an enormous creature flexing under a sheet. Rocket stands with his paws splayed and considers the big body of water as if it is the world\u2019s bath he has no intention of participating in. He lifts his nose and samples whatever is blowing off Superior and his mouth does that thing dogs\u2019 mouths do when they are trying to translate a language that is mostly mineral. We walk along the shore where other people have written their names in boot prints, and June slips the borrowed needle out of her pocket and holds both needles in one fist like a promise.\n\n\u201cWhat would we do if they did something.\u201d She squints like she is trying to look at an eclipse indirectly.\n\n\u201cProbably pretend they didn\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cWe are very polite. Plus, you\u2019d ruin your sleeves if the lake decided to be dramatic.\u201d\n\nWe stand with the whole white world pretending to be a photograph and I do, for a second, feel warmth radiate up through my palm where our needle rests. It could be the wind cutting into the angle between glove and sleeve making the rest of me feel colder by contrast. It could be the fact that June\u2019s shoulder is pressed into mine and she runs warm in February by habit. It could be that the lake approves of nothing and everything but takes pity on women who came to recognize something without trying to own it. Rocket leans against my leg as if to anchor my thinking, and when the ice makes a cracking sound far out that runs like a rumor beneath our feet, he watches the water and then watches me and chooses not to be afraid. His choice prevents mine.\n\nWe check into a hotel that sells itself on the promise of views and hot water that arrives when you ask for it. Rocket demurs at the elevator and then decides claustrophobia is for dogs who don\u2019t have a job. In the room he does the circle everything instinct demands, then settles with his head toward the door and his back toward the window like a creature born from both migration and duty. June leans in the frame and watches him with her hands folded around the twin needles, one wrapped, one not, as if she is at a wedding no one else is invited to but the bride and groom prefer it that way. We eat sandwiches that taste like compromise and exhaustion and a mustard that woke up on the right side of the jar. June avoids the hotel Bible in the drawer as if she will be recruited if she touches it. I put the needles on the windowsill and the dusk light finds their metal the way it finds certain leaves in summer and convinces them they are more important than the tree for a moment.\n\nAt night the lake\u2019s sounds grow weird. There is a lontananza to ice groaning, a sense that time doesn\u2019t belong to clocks. Rocket rises at some ungodly hour and licks my fingers as if I have left my hand out for weather. I sit up and my body conforms to the fact that sleep is a loan and he is asking interest. We stand at the window looking out at the black where white lived all day. June murmurs from her half of the room, the content of the murmur not intended for human translation. I realize I\u2019m smiling in the dark and that my face can do that without being told.\n\nIn the morning the city is in its bones again. We take Rocket to a strip of park where the snow plows have made new geography, and he investigates what other dogs have decided about Duluth\u2019s early hours. A woman with a husky passes and says, \u201cBy April your dog will be part iceberg,\u201d and I say, \u201cHe thinks he is now,\u201d and the husky laughs in husky, which is to say he sneezes with a flourish. We bring coffee to Thread & Tackle because courtesy is an easier version of worship and hand the twin needle back to R. Linn, who takes it without ceremony and tucks it into the box like a bird returning to a quiet nest. She looks at us as if we are more and less than she expected and says, \u201cKnock on wood when you get home,\u201d and then, as an afterthought somehow larger than the original thought, she slides something small across the counter toward me.\n\nIt is a tiny rose cap, twin to our needles\u2019 but with a hairline crack you can feel with your thumb and not see in this light. \u201cFell off a cousin once,\u201d she says. \u201cMy aunt keeps the other that matches. These like to go wandering. Sew it onto your scarf if you dare make my aunt roll in her grave. Or put it in your pocket and let it bother you. That\u2019s what objects are for.\u201d\n\nThe drive back is quieter because satisfaction is a softer weather than hope. Rocket sleeps for an hour and then wakes and watches the trees step backward. June rests her head against the window and pretends to nap while counting stitches in her head, and every now and then I see her hand go to her hair out of habit to touch the needle that is not there. I think about Marion, whether she is a story we need or a person who needed work, whether needles are the correct manifestation for grief, whether a man lost in a lake ever stops crossing someone\u2019s home in the night. I think about my father with his shop light and his bloodless knuckles and the way he always preferred tools made of things that did not rust and how he said once, when he was tired and honest, that water frightened him because it could ruin a plan without even trying.\n\nWe reach Minneapolis as if the city has agreed to be rediscovered. The buildings shrug themselves into their corners. The street where my apartment lives is plowed into obedience. Mrs. Barlow is in the lobby conducting a distribution of something that smells like cinnamon and democracy. She sees the folder under my arm and the needle in my pocket spills heat like a secret. \u201cYou still have your faces,\u201d she says to both me and June. \u201cThat\u2019s key.\u201d Her little dog looks at Rocket with hauteur and then with a small secret nod as if the lake applied some polish and he approves of the shine.\n\nIn my apartment, the scarf goes over the back of the chair because it deserves a chair. The rose cap sits in the dish with my keys like an orphan waiting to be adopted by my fingers. The needles\u2019 hum joins the apartment\u2019s hum, and while I still refuse to call it anything but comfort, there is an adjustment to the silence that has nothing to do with the refrigerator. Rocket walks the perimeter and then comes to sit in front of me and does the concentrated look dogs do when they have decided to learn your face. I reach into the dish and take the rose cap and press it into the scarf\u2019s rib where I will feel it with my throat on mornings when my voice would rather be precise than kind. June stands behind me and slides one hand along my shoulder as if positioning me under a skylight and says, \u201cYou went to the lake and you did not burst into flame. I call that progress.\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019ve always suspected flames are more of a summer problem,\u201d and tug the scarf into place and my mouth gives me away without my permission.\n\nThere is a Monday when work demands I make a presentation to people who sell packaged optimism for a living. Rocket watches me rehearse in the apartment with that attentive boredom that lets me repeat myself without feeling ridiculous. When I leave for the office, he flops into a shape that says, I am not abandoned, I am waiting, and I believe him. The conference room is a glass aquarium of men whose faces have learned all the ways to be interested without being available. I do the dance with the slides and the quiet and the data arranged like furniture, and I watch the way they hold their pens, the way their shoulders go from polite to engaged and back, and I notice that my voice has learned a way to be kind to me while being persuasive to them. When they ask about timelines and I tell them the truth in palatable portions, one raises an eyebrow and says, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten softer,\u201d as if I am bread or a body, and I say, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten accurate,\u201d and let the needle in my pocket warm me past rage.\n\nBy the time March leans into us, the city is making little hissy noises at its own edges. The snow banks have lost their innocence and gained dirt and footprints and the peculiar garbage that rises from winter like a confession. Rocket has learned the scent map of our block and occasionally stands in the hall staring at the elevator in the way of a person who wants to go to the roof and yell into the wind that has ignored him so far. Sprite thrives in photos my phone delivers: asleep with a toddler\u2019s foot touching her flank, nose buried in a blanket in a way that says the world can wait, sitting like an uncertain queen on a soft chair that belongs to a grandmother who writes me that she has never seen such determined politeness in an animal. We send Rocket\u2019s face back to the shelter sometimes anyway, because people like to be invited to happy as if it was their idea.\n\nOn a night when the temperature pretends to be magnanimous, June and I sit on my floor with the scarf across both our laps and the needle beside us and a map of Duluth open on the coffee table because we like to commemorate our adult decisions like children: here is where we stood and did not cry, here is where we bought coffee and felt capable, here is where the man in the orange hat said a sentence that still makes us ridiculous with laughter when we say it out loud. Rocket lies with his back against us and does the thing where his lungs push into our thighs when he breathes. June takes the rose cap out of the dish and sews it into the scarf\u2019s edge with five tiny stitches, a code no one else will read. When she knots the thread and bites it off, she says, \u201cThis is the part where I usually make a wish and pretend I don\u2019t believe in doing that,\u201d and then she looks at me with a face that is both my mirror and the person in the mirror who can look you in the eye.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, because people with wishes are messy and I have just gotten the apartment back into its shape.\n\n\u201cI wish for nothing dramatic,\u201d she says, as if that keeps the gods disinterested. \u201cI wish for slow mornings and the kind of luck that is indistinguishable from work. I wish for Rocket\u2019s breath to convince your voice that soft is not a compromise. I wish for my hands not to forget the way to do fisherman\u2019s rib when I\u2019m seventy and have a neighbor named Ernie who insists I join his bowling team even though he cannot count above seven. I wish for your mother to find the right way to be proud of you even if it does sound like an insurance brochure sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wishes have weight,\u201d I say, and feel that weight distribute itself across the room the way light does when it figures out how to use our lamps. \u201cMine is that the needle is only as magic as we need and no more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s godly restraint,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you ever start a religion, I will print the pamphlets.\u201d\n\nThere are more storms because this is a state where the sky does not care about your calendar. There are days I am too tired to be interesting and Rocket\u2019s needs save me by requiring that I leave an apartment I would otherwise haunt. There are mornings where a woman with grief in her face kneels at the dog park to press her cheek to the fur of three different creatures who will never know what they did for her and that is the correct arrangement. There are evenings I find myself sitting on the floor of my bathroom because Rocket decided it is a sanctuary and I am trying to meet him half an inch closer to wherever he came from. There are quiet in-betweens where the needle hums with the building and I hum with the day and neither of us has to prove anything to be believed.\n\nOne afternoon in late March, when the light decides to behave like it is related to a season we recognize, my father calls from his garage in a town where the river has already given up all pretense and shows up at the banks like a dog that knows the way home. He asks me how the dog is and I tell him the measurable things first because it helps him to know there are numbers: pounds, minutes, miles, kibble brands, the count of days without an incident he can categorize. Then I tell him that when Rocket sees a child running, he freezes and then looks at me, and my father makes a sound that might be approval, and I hear inside it the thud of a nail set into wood with exactly the right amount of force. He tells me about a cabinet he built that fits without needing a shim and about the way snow slid off the shop roof in one ornamental piece this morning and startled him enough that he swore in the good way. He asks me if I am walking, as if walking were something you can own or fail, and I say, \u201cTwice, sometimes three,\u201d and he says, \u201cGood,\u201d in the voice of a man who is trying to say I am proud of you without it doing anything stupid to his throat.\n\nAfter we hang up, Rocket comes and puts his head on my knee as if someone whispered his name across town. The scarf slides to my lap and the rose cap presses briefly against my skin, a small insistent reminder that stories don\u2019t always solve things, but sometimes they keep your hands busy while time does what time does. I press the needle into my palm and remember the lake. I tap my knuckles against the table just once because R. Linn told me to knock on wood when we got home and I didn\u2019t and superstition is silly and also a language we share when we don\u2019t know which one of us needs which spell. The hum of the building thickens as it always does at five p.m. when everyone with a job and a stove returns to their particular arrangements with heat and hunger. The city breathes. The room holds. Rocket sighs. I do not make a wish. I make dinner. We walk. We come back. We keep what we can from coming undone.Spring arrives in the way a person arrives at the end of a long corridor where they have read every sign twice and peered into every door: hesitant, apologetic, then suddenly certain. The piled snow along Nicollet turns into strata, gray on gray like a cake no one asked for, and the gutters learn to whisper again. The air smells like old pennies and the memory of worms. Rocket\u2019s nose thinks it is a library and checks out every book. The scarf is sometimes too much and then not enough depending on which corner of the block we\u2019re in. I find the sweet spot where it keeps my voice near my skin. The rose cap rests against my throat and reminds me that the world makes objects on purpose and people make stories around them whether or not the objects agree. When we reach the footbridge, the pond below has become the sort of surface that lies without malice. A black dog with eyebrows like punctuation gallops past and leaves Rocket deeply concerned about a grammar problem he cannot solve. I tell him we are all adjusting to new forms and he sneezes, which I decide is agreement.\n\nThe call from Katy comes at eleven on a Tuesday, which is when buildings choose to break because the day has not yet had its coffee. \u201cWater main,\u201d she says without sugar and without permission. \u201cBasement is filling, upper runs are loud. We\u2019re getting them out before floats become facts. Can you come. If you can\u2019t, I love you anyway,\u201d she adds, because she has learned to ask without making it a test. I am already packing the bag I keep for emergencies I do not believe in: spare leash, high-value bribes, nitrile gloves because I have learned the value of pretending you can stay clean, two towels that smell like my laundry soap, and the needle, which I pocket without interrogation because there are times to practice rationality and there are times to let your hands be superstitious. June texts three words in the kind of caps that make her phone look like a cheerleader: ON MY WAY. There is no discussion about whether Rocket is coming. He watches me in the hallway while I tie my boots and decides that staying home is not the job he wants today. I clip his harness with a ceremony that calms both of us and we take the elevator down in a silence that has a plan.\n\nThe shelter is a body in distress when we arrive, breathing too fast and sweating from places designed to stay cool. Water makes its own decisions along the hallway, that pathetic inch that is enough to make a mess of bureaucracy. The chorus is pitched higher than usual, voices layered with lists and leaks and the complicated thunder of dogs who want both out and in. Katy is everywhere. She moves like the kind of person you look for in a fire drill. She has towels under her arms and a roll of contractor bags clenched in her teeth and she is smiling at someone on accident because her face refuses to surrender its kindness. \u201cGrab the top run,\u201d she says around the plastic, dialogue elegant despite the circumstances. \u201cCrates stacked, left side, two are bolted stupid and one latch is rusted, don\u2019t get bit, don\u2019t make promises we can\u2019t keep.\u201d She touches Rocket\u2019s shoulder in passing and says, \u201cGood job,\u201d to both of us, and keeps going without checking to see if anyone needed that to be true.\n\nJune appears with a milk crate full of towels that belonged to a yoga studio that clearly did not survive January. She has her hair up with the needle pinned through it, and for half a second I register the absurd elegance of a woman who can look like a saint in a flood. We slosh down the hall together while Rocket negotiates wet tile with dignity. I tell him we are in a church and he should remember his indoor voice. He flicks his eyes to me and then walks as if his paws know how to read the room. The first run is chaos organized into pairs. Crates like apartments, stacked two and then sometimes three high, each with a temporary name and a face that has opinions. The top left crate has a zip tie where a latch should be and the dog inside is a smooth tan river of panic named Juniper. Her eyes do orbit math between me and the flood and back. I say her name the way you say your own in a mirror when you want to know if it still belongs to you.\n\nThe tie has been over-tightened in the way ties are when men with confidence and women with fear meet a plastic solution. My pocket knife slides under it and stops where melted bright green loses to metal. June hands me a pair of diagonal cutters she produced from somewhere in her cardigan and the sound of the cut is obscene and beautiful. The door swings and I slow it with my hip and my whole life. Juniper presses forward and I insert my body as a clumsy anti-door. I rub the top of her head and pretend an arc of my palm is a spell. She hesitates exactly as long as my breath and then climbs into June\u2019s arms because there are some physics models I will never get credit for. June walks away with a tan river that has decided to become a dog for the next three minutes, and I turn to the next problem.\n\nTwo crates down a latch has rusted itself into philosophy. The slider is a line seized to a promise. The dog inside is a speckled cattle dog with opinions he has been asked to flatten for weeks and the water is advancing in a way that makes the situation impolite. Rocket watches from his place against the wall where I asked him to stay, his body spelling patience in cursive, and I put my fingers on the metal because the instinct is older than reason. The needle in my pocket makes its presence known by doing nothing and being ready. I slide the rose cap into my palm by feel and use the shaft to lever the slider toward sense. It bends its initial refusal into a question and then into cooperation the way people do when you refuse to make a scene. The cap\u2019s little petals dig into my skin enough to feel like they are listening. The latch gives, not like surrender, more like a compromise, and I allow myself the small pride that comes when tools and will align. The cattle dog blasts out and then stops when I say wait because he has been told that word in a hundred rooms and only once did someone mean it like a bridge. I clip a leash to his collar and hand him to Gus who has appeared beside me like a man conjured by a list. He grins in the way of people who still believe in endorphins. \u201cNice pick,\u201d he says, and I realize he means the needle and not the dog, and I pocket whatever that does to my face.\n\nWhen the second string of crates has been opened and their inhabitants transferred into towels and arms and temporary lives, Katy\u2019s voice carries down from the back hallway where the grooming station has become a staging area. \u201cWe need the scared ones first,\u201d she says, and people arranged for brunch and left instead move at her words like prayer. Rocket and I ferry. He is the person I did not plan to be and I am the dog he hoped I was. We carry an old beagle with a sagging belly like a beloved aunt. We carry a pair of bonded chihuahuas who scream like teakettles until the moment you laugh and then they notice they can breathe again. We carry a hound whose voice is the only thing about him that knows how to be big. June brings towels and hearts and a tone I have only heard once from her when she talked a coughing child through a panic at a co-op with no inhaler. The needle sits quiet in my pocket and warms my hip as if it were in on a joke that does not require a punchline.\n\nThere is a moment where it starts feeling like we could be finished and that is always when the world says, How sweet. A sound rises from the far washroom that is not bark and not water and not any machine a civilized person should own. It is the seizure of a pipe giving up and the insult of something falling where it shouldn\u2019t and the grief of a creature who has had enough. Katy\u2019s voice goes low enough to make everyone else taller. \u201cCheck the south arm,\u201d she says, and then to me specifically, \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone get heroic. We need them alive, not impressed with themselves.\u201d The south arm is a narrow hall with half-height runs designed for overflow and regret. The last gate is bent out of square and the dog inside is a lurcher with a scar like a sentence down his flank and a name that says everything: Lionel. He is not panicking properly. He is looking at the gate like it said something rude about his mother and rehearsing biting his way to freedom. I do not like his rehearsal. I tell Rocket to down with my hand and my certainty and he flattens with such dignity it feels like he invented the command. I squat sideways to reduce my height and my threat and talk to Lionel about everything but the problem until the problem is not the only thing in the room. I use the needle to coax the bent bar back into alignment because imagination is a tool of mine, and when metal decides to be temporarily forgiving in the hands of a woman whose patience has been exercised all winter, I do not ask whether magic was invited.\n\nWe move them out. We move them up. The rooms fill with bodies that smell like bleach and hope and winter and wet dog and we make new plans around them until the room agrees to be that plan for an hour. June is a machine designed for comfort and leverage. She takes Sprite\u2019s foster\u2019s little boy by the hand when he appears with his mother carrying a crate that has become too heavy for her description of herself that morning. She sends him for more towels with the kind of praise that could raise a building. Rocket lies among the chaos like an exclamation converted into a period. People step around him automatically, their bodies rearranging in the ancient choreography of not stepping on the good thing. Katy passes me a clipboard and a look that reserves actual gratitude for later when she is not in charge of a crisis. She says, \u201cI owe you a drink that has an umbrella in it even if we have to skewer the fruit ourselves,\u201d and then, because she refuses to pretend there is only one kind of relief, she adds, \u201cHe is a better man when you\u2019re around. The board would hate how I said that but the truth rarely asks permission.\u201d\n\nBy three, the building is less angry. The water is not a narrative anymore; it is a mess. People are soggy in places they didn\u2019t know could be soggy. Dogs have been distributed to temporary addresses and the sound inside is something you could live with. Gus brings pizza as if the only food that should be eaten on the day a floor floods is something that admits it wasn\u2019t built to last either. June sits on a crate turned on end and eats her slice hunched to keep oil off her cardigan. I stand with my back against a kennel door that smells like clorox and clothing that once belonged to nicer occasions. Rocket sits at my knee and watches cheese as if it has been elected. Katy gets a call and her face does the thing faces do when news is better than it has any right to be. \u201cPlumber did the word triage with a straight face,\u201d she says. \u201cWe might save the south arm without tearing out the world. Insurance heard the noise it likes. I am going to say a sentence that will make me sound like someone else: I believe in checks arriving,\u201d and then she laughs because she hates that as a personality trait. She gestures with her chin to Rocket. \u201cHe was steadier than half my volunteers,\u201d she says, and I resist the urge to tell her that steadiness is not a breed but a decision.\n\nWhen we get home, the apartment smells like the version of my day that didn\u2019t get its way. I strip in the entryway in a way that feels more like molting than propriety and throw everything into the washer because sometimes cleansing is ritual and I am not sophisticated enough to refuse it. Rocket falls asleep in a shape that is 60 percent dog and 40 percent puddle. June sits on the floor with her back against my couch and her hair falls out of its pins like a flag deciding to be less patriotic. She has the needle in her hand and she rolls it back and forth across the floorboards with that small clink that sounds like a practical prayer. \u201cWhen you used it on that latch,\u201d she says without looking up, \u201cit looked like the movies where the woman in the sensible shoes saves everyone with the tool the man thought was decorative,\u201d and I open my mouth to say it was just a lever and then I close it because modesty is sometimes just a label we stick on fear. She leans her head back to look at me upside down. \u201cI know you don\u2019t actually believe in talismans,\u201d she says. \u201cI know you pocket it for your hands. But I like that your body is letting your brain be less lonely.\u201d\n\nWe sleep hard that night, the kind of civilian sleep that follows a day of emergency adjacent to us but not about us. I dream about water meeting its borders and deciding to be kind and when I wake I don\u2019t chase it. The next day it snows six inches because the sky is petty. We go to the park anyway and Rocket discovers that the new layer restores winter\u2019s reputation and tries to bury his face in it until he is a white muzzle with a plan. On the way back we pass a flyer taped to a light pole with blue painter\u2019s tape, my favorite brand of public pain. LOST reads the headline, and beneath it the face of a gray cat whose expression suggests he will be a disappointment to whomever finds him. Rocket sniffs the base of the pole as if it has an opinion about cats and I say, \u201cNo cats,\u201d as if that is a law we both agree to follow. A man emerges from the corner bodega with a bag of ice as if he doesn\u2019t understand the concept of outside. He holds the door for me and Rocket like a person who has decided that courtesy is better than belief. He says, \u201cHe looks like the kind that listens,\u201d and I realize the stranger is complimenting me in a language that suits both of us.\n\nI tell myself this is how you live now: you go to work and you send emails and you walk your dog when the sky says no and you answer calls when pipes explode and your neighbor gives you hearts like currency and you stitch a small metal rose into a scarf and pretend not to notice that when your hand slides across it your whole body remembers heat. You go to Butter on days you cannot justify and you and June sit close and split a piece of cake whose frosting tastes like the memory of butter. You listen to June talk about the woman at Fixations who knits too tight because she is trying to hold in a life she has not admitted she is leaving, and you tell June that you once corrected a man\u2019s grammar in a client meeting and he began pronouncing your name like it was a cautionary tale and neither of you apologize for any of it. You make appointments for Rocket\u2019s teeth and your own and remember to bring a notebook to both because novelty makes you an unreliable narrator. This is the part of the story where an author would insert a single-sentence paragraph about contentment being a conspiracy, and this is where I write an entire one without that trick, because contentment is not a spasm but a practice, and I am not interested in clever interjections when the muscle we are training is endurance.\n\nThe first real test comes not with water or weather but with children, as most tests around here do. The twins\u2019 moms arrange a casual courtyard thing for those of us who brave a March that thinks it is January. Someone drags out the corn hole boards as if reminding the building of summer is a civic duty. Someone else brings a tray of brownies that taste like nostalgia even if you don\u2019t share the nostalgia. The twins are allowed to bring their scooters and they do immediately and with no regard for shin integrity. Rocket has met these small beings on leashes and thresholds, but never at speed, never with sugar in their blood and faces made of future. I keep him on a long line that has saved marriages and reputations and I make my voice a low steady thing we could both use as a coat rack. I say, \u201cWe are going to practice being boring,\u201d to him and then to myself, and he looks at me like he is willing to pretend this is what he wanted all along.\n\nThe first pass of Scooter A is fine. Rocket looks and looks away and receives from me a small fish that once swam in an ocean I have not seen. Scooter B comes with a noise like a violin being insulted and Rocket\u2019s ears do their impressive, meaningful pivot and then his eyes find my thigh and I pay him with a word and the promise that if he can handle this, he can handle anything short of fireworks. The twins\u2019 moms watch with an interest that is neither intrusive nor performative. Mrs. Barlow makes a face at me from her chair like she is measuring the room against a past room in a different building and I pass whatever that test is because she has the decency to look pleased. A man I know only as loud upper floor guy ceases to yell into his phone for one minute and says, \u201cThat\u2019s a handsome animal,\u201d and I say, \u201cHe likes it when people are predictable,\u201d and loud upper floor guy barks out a laugh and says, \u201cDon\u2019t we all,\u201d and goes back to offering unsolicited advice to whoever is too far away to avoid it.\n\nThere is a scare. There is always a scare, because otherwise we would mistake a day for a movie. One of the twins, a girl with a face designed to disarm juries, turns to avoid a plant on the beaten path and the scooter goes out from under her in a way that gravity takes personally. Her knees meet concrete and her palms take the rest of the argument and she makes a sound like a kettle beginning to understand itself. The courtyard holds a breath because we are a species who knows what blood looks like. Rocket stands to figure out what to do about the sound and I tell him nothing because I am a woman who has memorized the value of silence. He looks at me and then at the girl and then he lies down with his ribs pressed flat to the earth. The girl\u2019s mother arrives in two strides and scoops her child in one practiced conflation of fear and practice. The crying is enormous in the small space between buildings. You can feel it roll across brick and shrub and my face, which has learned not to qualify noise as inconvenient. Rocket makes the smallest sound in the back of his throat, the vocal equivalent of a hand you set just near a friend\u2019s elbow so they can take it if they want and pretend it was theirs if they don\u2019t. The child hiccups and looks at him and does a thing that will be labeled brave depending on who tells it later. She holds out a small hand with streaks and says, \u201cHi,\u201d as if introducing herself to a person who has just moved in on her block. Rocket stretches his neck, nothing else, and sniffs with the gravity due to any new data. Then he rests his chin back on the concrete and breathes.\n\nI have to remind myself to breathe too. June appears at my shoulder with a wipe and a bandage the size of an adult\u2019s boasts and kneels without fanfare because she is not yet done proving that competence is sexier than people admit. The mother cleans, the child negotiates, the courtyard puts its shoulders down, Rocket blinks like a man who has decided a thing and sticks with it. Later the twins\u2019 moms bring me a cup of something in a mason jar that does not quite taste like lemonade and is sweeter for it and says, \u201cIf anyone asks us about your dog we will tell them he is a religious experience and that you probably have cousins you don\u2019t mention,\u201d and I say, \u201cI will accept the first part.\u201d Mrs. Barlow stands when she should not, because she wants to make an exit into a gesture, and says, \u201cThere are two kinds of stories in buildings like this. Today you told the one where everyone ends up eating cake,\u201d and I nod because those are the only days I have energy to stay for.\n\nWork tries to be a villain the following week and fails because I have learned to give it the correct role. A client sends an email that pretends to be urgent about a brand voice that was never alive. I stand at my counter with Rocket on the floor looking up at me like I might drop ethics and I write back, \u201cWe can insist on optimism without telling lies,\u201d and then, because I am a woman who has learned to plate palatable truth, I add three bullet points and an action plan. My supervisor swings by my desk in the way a person does with a speech and says, \u201cWhatever is happening in your personal life, stay there,\u201d and I do not tell him that luck is not a place. I schedule Rocket\u2019s vet check for Tuesday afternoon and go out to Loring Park in the morning to tell the trees about it because they are better at listening than my first employer.\n\nIt rains. The rain is committed in a way I find admirable. Minneapolis in rain feels like someone mistook our skyline for a spit of land off the coast of somewhere else and decided to grant us a maritime arc. Rocket disapproves at first because every sound is new again and then decides beads of water on his face are just another variety of attention. We walk in our hoods like penitent saints. June joins us because she needs to badger me into attending a craft fair that promises to be ninety percent macrame and ten percent jam, and we admire the way the pond trades its ice for geese with no apology. The needle warms in my pocket the way metal does when you place it against a body under a jacket. I do not make it anything it is not and still, I like the weight.\n\nOn a Thursday afternoon when the city cannot decide if it is threatening a storm or a party, my mother arrives with a suitcase that has seen two vacations and a funeral. She has chosen a coat that reads as neutral in every photo and a pair of boots she will later say are \u201cfine,\u201d which is how she locates her disappointments on an appropriate map. She treats Rocket like a question mark that came with my education. She holds her hand out the way videos tell her and he approaches with the gravity due to a woman who taught me how to read without letting me throw away the books. He sniffs and then does the lean that is his acceptance of this arrangement, and my mother\u2019s face tightens in the way some faces do when softness enters without knocking. She puts her palm on his head and says, \u201cYou are warmer than I expected,\u201d and then, to me, \u201cYou are more yourself than you sounded on the phone,\u201d and I choose to accept both items as compliments because my father does not have a monopoly on restraint.\n\nWe take her to Butter because it is church and because the city looks better from a seat by a window with eggs under consideration. My mother watches June with the curiosity she brings to mid-range restaurants and flea market items she will later pretend not to have wanted. June resists the urge to perform and fails in small ways that look like generosity. They talk about yarn like it is a language my mother might pick up if encouraged. My mother tells an unflattering story about me at four and follows it with a flattering one from thirteen because she has learned how to deliver herself to other people in combinations that do not compromise her pride. She asks me whether the dog sleeps on my bed and when I say, \u201cSometimes,\u201d she nods like she has just successfully predicted my character. On the way back we run into the lab and his man, whose name has settled into Colin in my head like a fact, and my mother says, \u201cHe looks stable,\u201d and I realize she meant the man and not the dog and I laugh in a way that uses muscles I have not used around her.\n\nWe do not fight because neither of us requires that sport anymore and we do not perform intimacy because neither of us trusts the scoring. We do walk together around the block and admire the symmetry of people\u2019s small trees in their windows while Rocket sniffs the base of things and performs the role of my reason to be between conversations. My mother pauses at the flyer for the gray cat and says, \u201cYou should not adopt a cat,\u201d as if she has caught me in the act of considered betrayal, and I say, \u201cI barely adopted a dog,\u201d and she says, \u201cYou adopted the world the minute you learned to read,\u201d and we both pretend we have not said anything too large to put away neatly. When she leaves two days later she hugs June harder than makes sense for a woman she has known for a forty-eight hour period and tells me that if I get married I should call her before I call anyone else because she owns certain dresses and certain opinions and I say, \u201cThat\u2019s a safe bet,\u201d and she frowns because I am making a joke where she was making an offer and I am a person who does that.\n\nIn April the city writes notes to itself in crocus. The ground spits up things we did not remember burying. Rocket brings me a stick one morning with an earnestness that seems to expect applause and I realize we have slid into family without a speech. Katy texts me a photo of a dog named Lionel sleeping upside down on a foster\u2019s couch with his belly in the air and a man\u2019s feet in the frame in wool socks with a hole in the toe and I feel that warm loop that connects us in absurd ways. Gus stops us in the park to tell me he is seeing someone whose dog does agility and he believes in a future where he carries tiny foldable tunnels in his car, and I realize I am more interested in his hope than I have been in any stranger\u2019s biography in a long time. June finishes the scarf and gives it to me with a flourish that accidentally makes me cry, and I discover that my face can do that in a room where it does not need to apologize. The needle hums along with the building and the spring and the fact that we are all still practicing.\n\nOne night I wake because Rocket wakes because the world wakes, and there is a sound outside like glass being asked too much of. I sit up in a body that has learned the price of standing as an intervention and listen. Down the hall, someone moves with urgency, the kind that keeps its own counsel. In the alley, a man\u2019s voice could be yelling or laughing and we will know only when the second voice arrives. The building breathes out its old heated breath and in the gap between exhale and inhale I reach for the needle on the nightstand and put it in my palm. It is cool and then not and I think not of magic, not of Duluth, not of any woman whose grief was smarter than mine. I think of lever and latch and the way metal believes in physics even when people don\u2019t. I think of friction and warmth and the thumb imprint in the rose cap that is mine now and not. I breathe, and the building breathes, and the sound outside resolves into nothing that belongs to us. Rocket lays his head back down on his paws and does the small groan that means I will be patient with the fact that everything had its own plan. We sleep, not because the world lets us, but because we have trained ourselves to be greedy for rest.\n\nLater, when the first thunder comes, it does not undo any of the work. Rocket lifts his head and tests the noise against his new archive. He decides he does not have to fight the sky. I decide I will not interpret every sound as drama. We go out in the morning after and the air smells like every metal object in my grandmother\u2019s garage knew a storm was coming and stayed anyway. The scarf around my neck is still too much for three blocks and then perfect and then like memory. The rose cap ticks against my collarbone like a metronome only I can hear. June meets us with a bag of lemon muffins and a story about a customer at the co-op who cried in front of the apples because sometimes you just need a place to cry, and the four of us\u2014two women, one dog, and the city which is its own being\u2014stand and decide that whether or not anything is magic, we are making ourselves into people who keep things from coming undone, and that will have to be enough.",

                              "content": "It\u2019s cold the way certain truths are cold, unbothered by your opinion. Minneapolis in late February has the kind of frost that gets into your marrow and starts rearranging the furniture. The sky is crisp paper. The sidewalks bite. Plows hiss past like creatures that have made peace with this place and don\u2019t care if you have. I am not immune to cold. I never claimed to be.\n\nI watch my breath plume outside the glass wall of the animal shelter on Hennepin, hands hooked inside the pockets of a coat I bought because the salesperson liked me. She smiled like a carousel; it was enough. I practice a smile in the reflection of the glass\u2014a smile I know will look acceptable, open, but not too much. People believe in medium.\n\n\u201cHi there,\u201d says a volunteer holding the door. His nametag says GUS in childish block letters. He has a gray knit beanie with a pompom, red cheeks, a wholesome face that would probably cry if you pressed the right buttons.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I say. The smile lands. Not perfect. Passable. If I were grading.\n\n\u201cFirst time here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d I\u2019ve been here three times. I catalog movements. Where the noise swells. The way people kneel and get soft around the cages as if the right angle will make their hearts bigger. Stalls of small lives and the small talk that cages make. \u201cI\u2019d like to talk to someone about adopting.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat. Come on in.\u201d His breath is the smell of winter and something else\u2014balm? He holds the door open longer than necessary. People do that. There are rituals that prove you\u2019re good.\n\nInside is warm, and the warmth feels worse somehow. Like stepping into someone\u2019s breath. Wet dog, bleach, rubber toys, human perfume trying to win over animal truth and failing. The dogs erupt when we pass. Some jump, some wag, some press themselves to the back corners of their crates like punks who don\u2019t need you. I absorb each detail almost greedily. I can always see the edge of things.\n\nGus leads me to a desk and hands me a clipboard. He does it with two hands like it\u2019s ceremonial.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d\n\n\u201cMara.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust Mara?\u201d\n\n\u201cMara Koenig.\u201d I decided years ago to keep my family name. My father said, at the time, it sounded like a story. He meant a warning.\n\nHe nods at the clipboard. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an application, some basic questions. Where you live, references, that kind of stuff. One of our adoption counselors will talk to you after you look around. No pressure.\u201d\n\nNo pressure. It\u2019s a phrase like a placebo. It\u2019s designed to make you feel as if you have agency. It makes me feel nothing at all.\n\nI take the clipboard and pen. It\u2019s one of those cheap ballpoints that chews the page and occasionally leaks like a tiny vein has popped. I fill in boxes with neat block letters. There are questions that are charmingly naive and questions that are traps.\n\n\u201cDo you plan to have your pet sleep on your bed?\u201d\n\u201cWhere will your pet be while you are at work?\u201d\n\u201cHave you ever surrendered an animal?\u201d\n\u201cHow many hours per day will your pet be alone?\u201d\n\nI answer truthfully, as much as I can. I have a good job that allows me to work from home three days a week. I say this, because rescue volunteers like that. The assumption that proximity equals love. Perhaps it does, sometimes. I understand proximity. I understand repetition. They are cousins.\n\n\u201cDo you believe in training?\u201d the form asks, in slightly different words, with phrases like positive reinforcement and dominance and e-collar and prong collar like little landmines. I circle \u201cpositive reinforcement.\u201d I can be positive when it pays.\n\nGus disappears to fetch something\u2014coffee, or a file\u2014and the dogs continue their chorus. A chocolate mutt with a comet tail watches me with yellow eyes. As if he\u2019s filing me, too.\n\nI feel my phone buzz in my pocket and slip it out. There are messages stacked like plates. One from June: You\u2019re really doing it. She\u2019s included a GIF of a cartoon dog wearing a sweater. Another from my mother with no text, just a link to an article about dog bites and \u201ctypes\u201d of people who shouldn\u2019t own dogs. She doesn\u2019t know how to copy a link without sending the entire ad-choked page. Her confidence in technology almost endears me. Almost.\n\nJune\u2019s second text: Remember to look \u201csoft.\u201d Bring your voice down. You know how you get.\n\nI type back: I am soft as a wool hat.\n\nShe sends a row of laughing faces and then adds, In case you forget, dogs can tell. People can too. But you know. Love you.\n\nThe word love makes a tiny ripple in me. It always has. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t value it. It\u2019s just\u2026 a word that seems to lose its shape when I look at it too long. Like a soap bubble: too much attention and it pops.\n\n\u201cReady?\u201d Gus reappears with a woman who looks like a sturdy book. Square shoulders, no-nonsense cardigan, the kind of woman you would ask for a Band-Aid and be right. Her nametag says KATY.\n\n\u201cMara?\u201d she says, the question softening the edges. \u201cI\u2019m Katy. I do adoptions and also foster the big goofballs nobody else can handle. You want to look at some pups first, or go through your app?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to meet them,\u201d I say. Honest. The clean hit of their need is\u2026 interesting. Like a challenge. Like a riddle I can solve.\n\nWe walk the corridor. The dogs do what dogs do: they perform. They whine and smile and bark with their whole bodies. Some withdraw. Some lick the air. The chocolate mutt with the comet tail watches without performing at all, his eyes a polished amber. He is not begging. He is learning me.\n\n\u201cThis is Rocket,\u201d Katy says. \u201cCame in with two siblings from a hoarding situation. He\u2019s smart. Mouthy. Food motivated. Could be a star with the right person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like stars,\u201d I say, and feel childish. June would smile at that.\n\n\u201cWant to say hi?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nShe opens the gate and Rocket rushes out as if the world is a tree to climb. He circles my legs, sniffs my hands, sits without being asked. Good boy, good boy, such a good boy, my mouth says, and my voice does that thing June mentioned, the thing I practiced. A softness, a rounding of edges. I scratch his chest exactly where he wants me to, because there are obvious places to scratch that humans miss in their excitement.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s picking up on you,\u201d Katy says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a calm vibe.\u201d\n\nCalm is the more agreeable word for it. I smile appropriately. Rocket leans into my palm as if my bones are something he recognizes. That is always the trick of it: proximity, repetition, reward. The body learns. The mind sits later and decides how it feels.\n\nKaty watches us as if an answer is forming. I let Rocket mouth the edge of my sleeve and then redirect him gently to a toy. Positive reinforcement. It\u2019s just another phrase for transaction.\n\n\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking you\u2019d need a yard, or a commitment to more walks than Netflix. I\u2019m thinking you\u2019d need a trainer willing to work with both of you. I\u2019m thinking your landlord\u2019s pet policy is going to matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy building allows dogs under fifty pounds with a deposit,\u201d I say. \u201cI\u2019m prepared to walk twice a day. Three times. I don\u2019t like Netflix.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone likes Netflix,\u201d Katy says, the kind of joke people make to test your humanity.\n\n\u201cI like books.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven weirder.\u201d She grins to show that I\u2019ve passed her test. We are human in the same room. \u201cOkay, here\u2019s the thing. We do home checks. We talk to neighbors. It\u2019s not personal, but people get\u2026 particular. We\u2019ve had situations. We want to be careful. You get it?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a tug in my chest I identify as irritation. Home checks make sense. Information makes sense. The neighbor part less so. Soliciting the opinions of people who play corn hole at 9 p.m. in the courtyard and set garbage next to the bin because inside is too hard. The woman who watches me water plants and once told me my basil was too aggressive.\n\n\u201cI understand,\u201d I say, because understanding is different than agreeing. \u201cHow soon?\u201d\n\n\u201cI could get out there this week,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re serious.\u201d\n\nI look at Rocket, who has moved to inspect my boots. I want him the way I want clean lines. I want him like a problem set. I want him because caring is an experiment I have not yet run with anything that can lick my face and ruin my shoes. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\n\nShe nods. \u201cGus\u2019ll process your app. You have references listed\u2014June Park, okay, and\u2026 your supervisor?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be in touch. Meanwhile, meet a few more? See if anyone else chooses you when you\u2019re not looking?\u201d\n\nI say yes. I let them choose me for twenty more minutes, and I choose none of them back. I listen to the cadence of volunteer voices. Good boy, honey, easy now. I imagine what it will be like to come home to movement. To have an animal that does not care whether I am the sort of woman people have complicated feelings about.\n\nOutside, the cold smacks me awake again as if I\u2019d fallen asleep pressed to a radiator. I text June: Rocket. The name makes me think of impossible arc. I type: He chose me. Meeting a counselor again. Home check soon. I add a neutral face, then delete it, then add a sparkler. People like decoration.\n\nJune answers almost immediately, because June\u2019s phone is an extension of her fingertips: Meet me at Fixations? I\u2019m picking up yarn before my class.\n\nFixations is the kind of shop you go into and forget what you came for because the colors do something to you. It\u2019s tucked between a halfhearted vape store and a boutique that sells houseplants like they\u2019re pets with even fewer demands. The bell over the door rings in two notes that remind me of a doorbell at a house where the people were always laughing. I enter the sweater smell and feel something like relief. It\u2019s warmer here than the shelter. It\u2019s warmer than an idea.\n\nJune looks up from a wall of wool and wiggles her fingers at me, the nails stubby and practical, flecked with sky blue. She is a tall olive branch of a woman with hair she refuses to cut and a cardigan she knit herself as a dare. On some people a cardigan is armor. On June it\u2019s a story. She hugs me like we climbed the same mountain, and my body allows it, then decides it likes it.\n\n\u201cYou did it,\u201d she says into my ear. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you I could\u2026 I don\u2019t know, buy an alpaca.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is cruel to alpacas,\u201d I say. It\u2019s a joke. It lands. She grins.\n\n\u201cTell me everything.\u201d\n\nWe settle in a back corner among baskets and skeins. A class is in full swing at a central table, a ring of women and one man all counting stitches in a litany that feels like church in a language I could learn. The teacher\u2014an older woman with steel hair and cat-eye glasses, mouth painted the purposeful red of women who choose their own lives\u2014holds up a pair of knitting needles like chopsticks made for giants.\n\n\u201cRocket,\u201d I say, and then tell June what she already knows because I texted it. I fill in details the way one might fill a jar with marbles: heavy first, slipping into gaps. My voice is flat but the content is interesting; I can do this. It\u2019s just data in a different frame.\n\nJune leans back and listens the way she does, with her whole face. \u201cI like the name,\u201d she says. \u201cI like that he sat for you. I like that you said books instead of Netflix. I like that your mouth did the soft thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always catch the mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mouth tells on you,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the best way. Are you nervous about the home check?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d The truth. Anxiety is a vague fog other people walk into; I\u2019m usually just awake or asleep.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d She reaches for a hank of heathered gray and rubs it between finger and thumb as if it holds a secret. \u201cWell, I\u2019m nervous for you, which will cancel everything out.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t cancel things like that,\u201d I say, and we both look at the wall of wool as if it will answer a math problem.\n\nThe class erupts into laughter because someone has done something wrong in a charming way. The teacher taps a needle on the table and says, \u201cThe heart of your ribbing is your intention,\u201d and everyone shuts up the way people do when a grandmother says something both ridiculous and true.\n\nJune narrows her eyes. \u201cI want that on a tote bag,\u201d she says. \u201cOr tattooed on my butt. Hey, have you eaten? I could knit you a sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll go to Butter. My treat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have money.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop making money so aggressively,\u201d she says. \u201cIt alarms the yarn.\u201d Her hand slips into mine for a second, a small pressure like a periodic table property, something that exists whether I believe in it or not. \u201cI\u2019m excited about you being excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am excited,\u201d I say, tasting the word. It lands on my tongue like a coin. I flip it. It lands heads.\n\nWhen I get back to my building that evening, the lobby smells like chlorine and someone\u2019s dinner. The mailboxes are the kind that promise secrets and deliver coupons. I flip through envelopes like a gambler and toss most of them into the recycling bin. When the elevator doors open I consider the eight steps to the stairwell and decide I should practice for having a dog. We will take steps together. We will repeat them until they belong to us.\n\nOn the second floor, Mrs. Barlow\u2019s door is cracked. She is an avian woman who coats the hall with her opinions like hairspray. Her small dog wears a sweater and a permanent alarmed expression. In my mind their voices are one voice.\n\n\u201cMara,\u201d she calls, because that is what she does when she hears motion. \u201cYou\u2019re home early. Is that on purpose?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is on purpose,\u201d I say, then remember the home check, the neighbor interviews. I tuck the sharpness in. \u201cGood evening.\u201d I put warmth in my mouth the way people add lemon to tea.\n\nShe peers at me like I am the answer to a question she didn\u2019t study for. \u201cThey said someone from a rescue might ask about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe ladies from 11-C. The ones with the twins. They asked me if I trusted you with a dog. I said that depends on the dog.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I say, unsure if I mean it. I picture the twins as white noise machines in tiny sneakers. \u201cDid they ask if I\u2019m quiet, too?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have to,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all know you\u2019re quiet. People like to fill in quiet with whatever scares them. Personally, I appreciate quiet. My husband was a carpenter. He left a hum behind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of hum?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe kind that builds something and then doesn\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d she says, then tilts her head as if she\u2019d said something stranger than she intended. \u201cWell. You tell them nice rescue ladies that you smell like decent coffee and you pick up your packages on time.\u201d\n\nI nod. \u201cThat seems actionable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know I like you,\u201d she adds, which is one of the few sentences in English that can make people cry. \u201cYou look... like you know where you\u2019re going. But sometimes I think that\u2019s not the same as being kind. You know how people confuse those.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I say. I do.\n\nInside my apartment the heat clicks on like a decision. It\u2019s a clean space. Not spare, exactly, but precise. The couch has angles. The bookshelves are organized by color because it stirs visitors. A plant in the corner thrives despite me. I open the window to let in a scratch of cold and sit at my kitchen table with a notebook, because pens and paper anchor me in a way screens never will.\n\nI write: Things Rocket Will Need. I break it into categories without thinking. Food (grain-free? ask June), bowls, leash, harness, bed (no stuffing to rape, June\u2019s phrase), crate, toys (Kongs, rope, puzzle), vet, trainer, snow boots for me, paw balm for him. I write paw balm and feel the swish of the words like a tongue on teeth.\n\nI do not write: what will it feel like to be watched by a creature with no agenda but the next moment? Because I can\u2019t quantify that and I won\u2019t try. Not yet.\n\nI sleep, eventually, with a sharp clean tiredness I recognize from other beginnings. The start of a course. The first night in a new apartment. The morning before a hike the internet says is moderate and ends up rearranging your knees. When I wake, light is already pushing at the blinds, and the city has made a thousand small noises without me.\n\nMy phone hums. From an unknown number: Hi, this is Katy from the shelter. Can we do a home check Thursday at 10 a.m.? We can bring Rocket for a trial too if you\u2019re ready.\n\nI type Yes before considering the optics of eagerness. Then: Please bring Rocket. Thank you. The words stand there, polite. I add: Looking forward to it. A garnish.\n\nJune sends a string of knit emojis, which look like bowls of noodles to everyone else. Butter at noon on Saturday to celebrate? she texts. Also I found something weird at the thrift shop. Bring coffee.\n\nI go to work. I answer emails. My supervisor calls my name as if it\u2019s a dog that\u2019s wandered. \u201cMara,\u201d he says, \u201cwe\u2019re thrilled about your initiative on the Bergstrom account. How do you feel about spearheading more of the client communications?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I say, which is the right answer if you want more work and less conversation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a rock,\u201d he says, and I think: No. Rocks don\u2019t move. I move.\n\nBy Thursday morning the apartment is auditable. I rearrange less than one would expect. I hide a book with a cover that would make Katy think I am trying to appear to be something I am not. I leave the plant where it is, thriving. I put away the knife block because Mrs. Barlow\u2019s hum concerns me. I take out the trash and then take it out again as if trash multiplies overnight. I brush my teeth twice and wonder if dogs care about human breath.\n\nThe knock is a sequence with a personality. Two quick, one slow. I open to Katy and Gus and a thread of winter behind them. Rocket is an orbiting idea at the end of a leash until he sees me, and then the line straightens as if he knew we were on the same page of the same book, which is a ridiculous metaphor. He licks my wrist once, definitively. I let the soft come.\n\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s almost natural. \u201cCome in.\u201d\n\nKaty does the tour and I hang back the way people hang back when someone else is leading a blindfolded party through their own home. \u201cFloors are solid,\u201d she says, tapping the wood with the toe of her boot. \u201cNo loose rugs. Window screens are\u2026 present.\u201d She checks an outlet as if electricity is the kind of thing you can persuade. \u201cCrate fits there. You\u2019ve got a line of sight from the couch so he doesn\u2019t feel exiled. Good.\u201d\n\nGus throws a rope toy for Rocket and Rocket brings it back like the end of the world depends on it. The three of them make noises that are almost identical: little ahs and wows, the language of delight. It\u2019s contagious if you want it to be. I let it in. I say, \u201cGood boy,\u201d not because Katy wants to hear it but because the dog does.\n\nKaty\u2019s eyes track shelves, corners, the blank space under the windowsill where a radiator would have been in a different life. She asks questions with her eyebrows. I answer with my mouth. We do a dance of competence. We all feel civilized.\n\nThen the neighbor part, which comes the way a cough comes, inevitable and unpleasant. \u201cWe reached out to a few people in your building,\u201d Katy says, flipping a folder shut as if that contains consequences. \u201cMostly positive. Mrs. Barlow loves you. The twins\u2019 moms said you are\u2026 head down, reserved, never had guests?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that a crime?\u201d I ask. My voice almost laughs, almost snaps. I let it ripple out and become nothing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the rescue has to consider\u2026 fit. Dogs who need people. People who need dogs. People who like community. Mrs. B said you\u2019re very responsible but sometimes look at her dog like you\u2019re taking an exam.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I say. I let a smile crack. \u201cHe\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\n\nKaty looks at me for a beat too long, the way you look at a painting you don\u2019t know if you like yet. \u201cI think Rocket likes you,\u201d she says finally. \u201cI think you could do this well. I\u2019m just the messenger, though. The board votes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ll be in touch. Don\u2019t despair if it\u2019s a no at first. Sometimes no turns into not yet.\u201d\n\nGus says, \u201cHe sat in your bathroom. He only does that when he feels safe,\u201d and I imagine what it is to be told your bathroom is a sanctuary. It\u2019s not wrong.\n\nWhen they leave, Rocket\u2019s leash in hand, the apartment feels like the minus of something. It\u2019s clean and warm and full of a sound that isn\u2019t there. I stand very still and then I don\u2019t.\n\nI go to Butter to meet June. The place is full of the good chaos of plates and batter and people whose hair is doing whatever it wants. The coffee here tastes like someone\u2019s best morning. June has taken a table in the corner with a view of the door because she likes to notice arrivals. She has a paper bag with a logo I don\u2019t recognize, which means it\u2019s going to be something we call a treasure even if it\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d it go?\u201d she asks, and I read the answer in her eyes before I say it.\n\n\u201cThey liked my bathroom,\u201d I say. \u201cThey were unsure about my face.\u201d\n\nShe squeezes my wrist the way one might squeeze a lemon. \u201cSo they\u2019re human,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t let them be your god.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a god,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou have many gods,\u201d she says. \u201cYou just disguise them as habits. Here. Look what I found.\u201d She reaches into the bag and yields a knitting needle the color of tarnished moonlight. It\u2019s metal, not quite aluminum, not quite steel, thin the way a whisper is thin. The end of it has a little cap in the shape of a rose, or maybe a thorny star. It catches the light in a peculiar way, like it\u2019s absorbing the room and giving you back a different version.\n\n\u201cIt was in a bin with old belts and a fur hat that smelled like the nineteen-seventies,\u201d she says. \u201cLook at the tip. It\u2019s odd. It\u2019s almost\u2026 warm?\u201d\n\nI touch it and feel the heat of her hand. And then, just beneath that, something else. A hum. Not loud. Not showy. The kind of hum a refrigerator makes in the middle of the night that reminds you the world is still working. \u201cIt\u2019s probably cheap,\u201d I say. \u201cEven cheap things can feel real.\u201d\n\n\u201cEven real things can feel cheap,\u201d she says, and then laughs at herself because she sounds like the cat-eye teacher. \u201cI thought I might use it for the scarf I\u2019m making you. The soft one. The kind your face will believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t knit a face,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised.\u201d She turns the needle in the air, and I swear the light goes sideways for a second. The bell over the Butter door rings. A waitress drops a fork and the sound sticks to the air like a static balloon. June frowns. \u201cWeird,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a\u2026 lucky needle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no such thing,\u201d I say, but I pocket the idea anyway. Luck is just pattern recognition you can\u2019t justify.\n\nWe eat eggs that taste like they remembered the chicken. June talks about the class at Fixations, about a woman who knit her feelings so tightly she gave herself a headache, about the man at the table who said purling reminded him of his mother\u2019s voice saying his name. I talk about Rocket and about the way he leaned into my hand and then away, both true. June\u2019s eyes go soft and then bright. The needle glints on the table like it is listening.\n\nWhen the call comes that night I am slicing carrots like an apology. The knife is new and cuts as if it\u2019s in a hurry. Katy\u2019s voice is both kinds of sorry. The kind you mean and the kind you sell.\n\n\u201cThe board is concerned,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing you did. You were great and Rocket loved you. They just\u2026 there\u2019s a vibe. I\u2019m pushing, but I wanted you to hear it from me now. They have final say.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat vibe,\u201d I ask, though I know. The kind of non-vibe that makes people uneasy because it doesn\u2019t look like what TV taught them. The rest of the sentence is waiting.\n\n\u201cThey want a yard,\u201d she says. \u201cThey want kids. They want the story we tell ourselves about rescue and rescuees. Look, come in and volunteer. Let them see you. Sometimes it\u2019s not that they need more information. They need more proximity.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd don\u2019t give up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d I say, though my voice makes it sound like I\u2019m convincing a child.\n\nI hang up. I look at the carrot coins like money. I do not cry. I have cried before, in the dark, at movies where a dog dies and the music tells you how. It is an involuntary response like a sneeze. This is not that. This is\u2026 the pause in a song where something else could happen.\n\nJune arrives ten minutes later because she tracks my weather with a barometer she keeps in her chest. She doesn\u2019t say I\u2019m sorry. She hands me the tarnished needle and says, \u201cHold this,\u201d and then she looks at my face as if she is knitting it.\n\nI hold the needle. Maybe it vibrates. Maybe my hand does. The apartment hums with the heating vent and the refrigerator and the building\u2019s collective lungs. Something has to happen, and when it doesn\u2019t, I am almost relieved.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cOr the next day. Or we go somewhere else. There are other places. There are other dogs. There is this needle. There is me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fix things,\u201d I say. I say it because she will not take it as a challenge.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cI just keep you company while they break and while they mend.\u201d She looks at the needle again, suspicious. \u201cAnd sometimes I buy questionable metal objects from suspicious bins.\u201d\n\nWe do what we always do when there\u2019s a decision we didn\u2019t get to make. We make tea. We sit on the floor because chairs are too official. June tells me about a scarf pattern with the satisfying name of Fisherman\u2019s Rib. I tell her about Mrs. Barlow\u2019s hum. She listens like it matters. We both pretend we don\u2019t see the place on the rug where a food bowl could go.\n\nLater, after she has left, I take the needle out of its paper bag and lay it on the table next to my notebook. The cap with the little rose catches and throws the lamplight. I put my finger on the metal and wait. For luck. For the kind of story that turns a no into a not yet into a yes. For a dog who chooses me because I am exactly what he needs. The needle is quiet the way a lake is quiet from the shore. If it\u2019s magic, it\u2019s the kind that does not announce itself.\n\nI sleep without dreams, or with dreams I don\u2019t fetch. Morning comes sluggish and then suddenly. The city outside is a tractor beam of weather: sun on snow that looks like sugar, air that will punish your ears if you forget your hat. I line my boots by the door because I will be a person who walks twice a day. I put the needle in my coat pocket because carrying an object makes it mine.\n\nOn the way to work, I cut through Loring Park and watch a man teach his lab to heel. The dog looks at him like he is the good kind of god. The man laughs the way people laugh when they feel seen and in charge. I imagine Rocket and me. I imagine what it is to be useful to another animal.\n\nMy phone buzzes with a number I know now. Rocket\u2019s file, the subject line says. Inside is a note: We\u2019re going to revisit your case next week. In the meantime, would you like to foster one of Rocket\u2019s siblings? Short-term. See how it feels.\n\nI stop on the bridge and the snow on it sparkles like secrets. The city is moving because that is what cities do. June always says you can knit a sweater one stitch at a time and eventually your whole body is warm. I type: Yes. I type: Yes. I type: Yes. Then I add: I would like that very much, even if the very much feels like an outfit I\u2019ve borrowed for a party I haven\u2019t been invited to yet.\n\nThe air decides to find my face and pinch it. I put a hand in my pocket. The needle sits there like a line I have not yet cast. I imagine what a magic object would do if it wanted to be useful. Then I stop imagining and walk to the office, because not all magic is dramatic. Sometimes it\u2019s just the part of your life that keeps the rest from getting too quiet.\n\nAt lunch I meet June on Nicollet and we stand in a patch of sun as if we can feed from it. She peeks at the pocket with the needle. \u201cYou carried it,\u201d she says. \u201cSuperstitions look good on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made Loring Park feel like a place instead of a set,\u201d I say. I surprise myself.\n\n\u201cSee? I told you. It\u2019s totally benign witchcraft.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, half laughing. \u201cYou\u2019ll scare the rescue board.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, eyes rolling skyward. \u201cThey can go knit their own noses.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the ribbing of the nose matter,\u201d I ask, and she snorts so loudly a pigeon startles.\n\nThe week moves like an animal that knows the path and isn\u2019t in a hurry. I volunteer at the shelter on Monday night and mop floors while a terrier named Olive tries to mop me. I listen to the way people sweeten their voices. Good girl. Good. There is a high schooler who speaks to the husky like it\u2019s a god and a man in a suit who can\u2019t stop checking his watch even while a dog licks his palm. I stand with Olive until she stops shaking, which takes exactly seven minutes and the tone of voice I learned as a child when my mother\u2019s favorite vase broke and she didn\u2019t know whose fault it was and I told her, Nobody\u2019s.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Katy texts: Today at five? Bring your soft voice. The sibling\u2019s name is Sprite.\n\nI leave my office as if it isn\u2019t trying to keep me. The sky at five is the color of tin. The snow has conceded to grit. Sprite is smaller than Rocket and more nervous. She trembles in the car and then in the elevator and then less, in the apartment, in the hall of my refrigerator and my sink. I show her the crate like it\u2019s a tent and she walks in and sits and looks at me as if waiting for a story.\n\n\u201cYou are not Rocket,\u201d I say. \u201cYou are not less either.\u201d\n\nShe blinks. June arrives with a bag of treats and the needle tucked through her hair like an ornament. \u201cI heard Sprite,\u201d she says, and Sprite hears her name and wags once, decisively. Dogs are practical poets. They understand repetition and emphasis.\n\nWe sit on the floor. June knits a row, purls a row, knits two, purls two, and the scarf grows like a sentence. The needle in her hair slides a little and then stops. I think of Mrs. Barlow\u2019s hum, of the man in Loring Park, of Rocket\u2019s mouth on my sleeve, of the fact that I do not need a yard to be a place.\n\nThat night, when Sprite curls into a comma at the foot of my bed because I could not bear the crate for her first night and maybe never will, the needle on my nightstand catches the streetlight and keeps it. If it does magic, it does it without confetti. If it has a promise, it is not loud.\n\nI do not think about whether my face looks like kindness in the dark. I do not think about the board. I do not think about anything at all for a long time. When Sprite sighs, it sounds like a decision. When I fall asleep, I am surprised to find that I do it with my hand outstretched, fingers just touching the cool metal of something that may or may not be lucky. The air outside doesn\u2019t care about luck. It will be cold tomorrow. We will put on boots. We will walk anyway.",

She does it by placing her chin on the mattress and exhaling like a timid dragon. The room has that morning cold that turns noses into small arguments and makes you aware of your ears. I slide my hand out from the covers and the air bites hard enough to remind me where I live. Sprite licks my knuckles once and then takes her head away as if the contact startled her too. She smells like the shelter still, a cocktail of bleach and dry kibble and maybe a hint of whatever grass exists beneath all this snow.\n\nI speak the way June suggested, as if the words have wide hems. Good morning. We\u2019ve been alive all night. I say it as if it\u2019s a joke and a blessing and Sprite blinks in the slow way of creatures who have long ago decided that speed is not the same as safety. When I sit up she steps back, tail low but moving, and her eyes make a bracket shape at the corners. Body language is just syntax with fur. I get up without turning on the light because I know where my toes are supposed to go, and because light feels like an accusation when you haven\u2019t earned it yet.\n\nThe floor is cold and the air is colder. I pull on socks that I bought because they were described as suitable for long Arctic walks when accompanying a research team with a tendency to underreport the weather. Marketing is just a story with a mirror. Sprite follows me to the door and sits before I ask, a small victory that I didn\u2019t win. I put the leash on and she ducks and then presents her neck like a fragile bridge. The clip makes a polite sound that feels like asking and getting permission.\n\nOutside, the stairwell smells like old varnish and coin laundry. The hallway is quieter in the morning, like a throat clearing. Mrs. Barlow\u2019s door is closed for once, and I feel a childish tug of disappointment. Her dog is probably beneath a throw blanket thinking about the life it could have had if it had been born a hedgehog. On the second floor someone has left a grocery bag on the landing, and Sprite gives it an entire federal investigation before concluding that it is neither friend nor enemy. We move past it like dignity does.\n\nThe winter bites correctly. It finds the seam between glove and coat and shakes it a little, just to show that it can. Sprite steps onto the sidewalk and then lifts a paw like a ballerina who didn\u2019t see the ice. I make the sound June calls my spill prevention noise, a low oh-oh-oh that is ridiculous and works anyway. Sprite gives me a glance that might be gratitude or might be the canine equivalent of You\u2019re embarrassing me, and then she adjusts her gait and we practice what it is to share a pace.\n\nLoring Park is less beautiful than yesterday and also more honest. The snow has turned to that pilled state sweaters get after hard use. The sun is out but doesn\u2019t want to be here, and I respect it for showing up anyway. A man runs past in shorts because men in Minnesota run in shorts like a religion, and Sprite watches him until he is a theory. When we reach the bridge, she stops. She looks through the railing at the blank white surface of the pond and then at me. If there were a caption it would be: I have been asked to believe many things, and I am not sure about this one. We stand there together for a pace too long, and then I say, Let\u2019s go, and we do.\n\nWe pass the lab from yesterday and his man. The man is wearing the sort of headband that suggests this is not his first winter with ears. He nods at me as if we share a profession. The lab gives Sprite one of those careful dog greetings, side-of-face, polite sniff, averted eyes, the whole exchange like a formal waltz at a ball for minor nobility. Sprite trembles at first and then inhales as if the other dog is a complicated soup she needs to identify ingredient by ingredient. They part without incident, and it feels like a small treaty. The man says, Cute, and I say, Thank you, as if I made her last night out of felt.\n\nBack home the elevator takes us with a sigh. Sprite leans against my leg in a way that is both clingy and brave. In the apartment I unclip the leash and she stands next to me waiting for instruction she doesn\u2019t need. I open the crate and toss in a biscuit like a coin into a well. Sprite goes in and turns around and sits as if the crate has told her a joke that only they share. I give her a second biscuit because I believe in redundancy when it comes to love. Then I stand in my kitchen and pour water into a kettle as if this were a ritual and not a crutch.\n\nWork is there whether I want it to be or not. I set up my laptop at the table because the couch asks for slouch and slouching feels like a sin before eight. Emails surge in with subject lines like gentle obligations. I answer them in the order Middle-of-the-road Me would approve. I keep an eye on Sprite in my peripheral vision. She chooses the spot near the radiator, which is not a radiator but a modern vent that is trying so hard to be good that I want to pat it. Sprite lowers herself and then uncoils, folds her paws under, and stares at me like I am nature.\n\nIn a lull between pings, I take the needle out of my coat pocket and put it next to the kettle. It gleams under the kitchen light like an object in a museum that insists on being labeled Untitled. I feel silly for carrying it and then I don\u2019t. The metal is cold, then not. When I roll it between my fingers it hums the way the refrigerator hums, the way my blood hums if I sit very still and listen. I wonder if I am making it up. I wonder what it would mean if I am.\n\nJune texts me a photo of a skein that looks like the inside of a seashell and says, Tell Sprite that the fishermen\u2019s rib will make her believe in the concept of texture, and I make a mental note to tell her the way an aunt tells a child about Santa knowing all the ways she does wrong and loving her anyway. The kettle lifts its small voice to a boil. I pour the water and the steam bursts up, and Sprite lifts her head like a question mark. I say, Tea, as if that answers something, and she lays her head back down as if it does.\n\nBy mid-morning, the part of my brain that watches other parts of my brain notes that I am monitoring Sprite\u2019s breathing the way some people monitor stocks. Each sigh tick marks on an invisible ledger. She gets up and follows me to the bathroom and sits outside the door, and I have a ridiculous thought about modesty, about animals that wait for the weather of their people to pass. When I am done I find her in the bathroom, sitting on the bath mat, gazing at the tub as if it contains history. The bathroom is a sanctuary, Gus had said, and I wonder why. Maybe it is the tile, the acoustics, the way rooms without soft things do not make extra noise. Maybe she likes the tightness of small corners. There are entire books about the way animals sleep.\n\nAt noon I make an omelet that is too perfect to eat if I were a different person. Sprite watches me whisk eggs with a focus that is nearly religious. I drop a piece of bell pepper and she ducks as if it might explode. When it does not, she creeps forward and takes it and chews it with the careful jaw motion of someone working out their feelings about vegetables. I find myself smiling with my actual mouth and not the practiced one. It is, in the spectrum of miracles, a minor one, but I catalog it because that is what I do with moments that might float away.\n\nThe afternoon is a quilt of tasks and pauses. I take the needle to my desk like talisman and pen. I click through slides and correct a colleague\u2019s slide title with exactly as much grace as I can manage, which is more than it would have been last year. I take Sprite out at three and we practice stairs again. On the third step landing, the grocery bag is gone and has been replaced with a wet shimmer that looks like ordinary water and is not. I make the oh-oh sound and then say, Wait, and Sprite waits. I test the shimmering patch with my boot and almost go down in a way that would have been slapstick if it weren\u2019t bones. I reach out to steady myself and my fingers find the needle in my pocket before they find the railing, and the needle is warm enough to startle me. It is probably my body heat after all these mornings of superstition. It is probable because the alternative requires permission.\n\nWe make it down without me becoming a lesson, and on the way back we run into one of the twins\u2019 mothers, the one with the good parka and the expression that says she has recently read an article about boundaries. She looks at Sprite and then at me and then she notices that I notice the looking. I smile somewhere between acceptable and open. She says, You fostering? and I say, Yes, like I am taking a test that will be scored by a committee. Her face softens, which is what it looks like when strangers decide to make room in their day for your existence.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s sweet,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were worried about Rocket. He seemed\u2026 intense.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo am I,\u201d I say, and surprise both of us. Sprite blinks between us, triangulating our weather. The twin mother nods and holds a bag of groceries up like an explanation for why she cannot help me if this goes wrong, and then she says, Good luck, and I say, Thank you, the kind you mean and the kind you sell.\n\nIn the late afternoon, the shelter calls to check in on Sprite. It\u2019s a woman I haven\u2019t met yet, with a voice like practical wool. She asks me about appetite, about elimination, about interest in play. I answer in a tone that is confident enough to make other people comfortable and truthful enough to make me feel like I have not moved my own furniture around. I say, She is cautious and curious, and I do not say, She has memorized the order in which I exhale. The woman says, Great, and then tells me that the board will meet Friday morning about Rocket and that I should not read anything into the timing because timing has its own agenda.\n\nWhen June gets off work, she arrives with a bag of chew bones and a small jar of something labeled paw balm in a handwriting that is half doctor, half kindergarten teacher. She sits on my floor the way people sit on floors when their bones know the score, and Sprite sidles up to her and lays her chin on June\u2019s knee with the kind of trust that makes your throat aware of itself. June always smells like citrus peels and the idea of lavender. She says to Sprite, We\u2019re going to like each other a reasonable amount, and Sprite wags once as if to sign a contract.\n\nWe practice an exchange game where you give a thing and get a better thing because that is the promise we all want from the world. Sprite takes the chew and then brings it back and then takes it again and then looks at me as if to confirm this is not a trick. June knits two rows and then holds the needle up to the light and says, This thing feels like an argument I\u2019m almost done winning, and the light through the window leans in and then leans away as if the afternoon is being edited. I look at the needle and it looks back in the way objects look back when you decide they do.\n\nAfter June leaves, I get careless. I am not careless often, and when I am, I notice. I put water on for pasta and then put the lid on the pot and then the lid slips off the spoon rest and clatters to the floor with that impossibly loud sound that lids make, as if they have been waiting their entire lives to demonstrate gravity. Sprite startles so hard that she becomes a different dog. She bolts. The door is ajar because I took out the trash and forgot that the world is a place where doors have rules. She shoots through the gap like a negative space. By the time my brain jams its feet into my mouth to say something useful, she is in the hall, then at the stairs, then on them, and the hall holds the echo she leaves behind like a hand.\n\nI do not swear because swearing is punctuation, and this requires grammar. I grab the leash and the bag of treats and I grab the needle because it is there and because I am superstitious when the alternative involves a body on concrete. The stairwell sucks heat out of everything that enters it. I take the steps two at a time and realize that I am the sort of person who will chase a frightened thing and that frightened things do not like to be chased. I slow down and adjust my mouth. I lower my voice to the level of just-a-river. Sprite, I say, and the syllable is the only one she knows and it means everything.\n\nOn the second-floor landing I hear the click of small nails and the sound of a body making itself narrow. I follow it past Mrs. Barlow\u2019s door and past the twins\u2019 door with the drawing of a snowman that looks like a surveillance camera. I turn the corner and find Sprite pressed into the far angle of the hall like a letter that slipped under the wrong door. Her eyes are black moons in winter. She is shaking so hard I can see her ideas. I do not make the mistake of going straight toward her. I sit down halfway down the hall and put the needle on the floor next to me because my hands feel like they might do something stupid and they need an occupation.\n\nWhen I breathe, I do it out loud because dogs believe in sound more than sense. I scatter three treats halfway between us and then I look at the ceiling as if I have seen better ceilings and this one is not the worst. Sprite watches my hand as if it is a small animal and then she watches my face. She half-stands and then sinks and then half-stands again as if hope and fear share a bed. I keep my voice low and bored and I say, Sprite, good girl, and then once I say, Come, and I make myself look away again to show that I am not a storm.\n\nThe needle is beside my shoe. If it is doing anything, it is doing it the way tea does things to water. The hall light buzzes the way bad fluorescent lights buzz in movies to warn you the killer is behind you. There is no killer. There is a dog who ran because her life recently became a door. After a minute that is ten minutes long, Sprite does the impossible math. She slides forward three inches and takes the first treat with a motion so quick it could be an edit. Her tail twitches at the very end like a punctuation mark. She takes the second and the third and then stops again, eyes on my hand. I do not move my hand. I wait. I become waiting. I make the space between us the right size.\n\nSprite takes a step into that space and then another and then the space is gone. When she is close enough that I could reach and ruin it, I do not. I hold myself still as the smallest promise. She sniffs my shoe and the needle and the leash and the edge of my knee, and then she sighs the way people sigh when they find a reason. I slide the leash under her chin and she lets me clip it. The click of the metal is the kind of sound you can love if you decide to.\n\nOn the way back up, I meet Mrs. Barlow coming down in a robe that suggests she believes in dressing for all occasions. Her little dog peers around her calf like a puppet that has seen things. Mrs. Barlow\u2019s hair is a careful nest. She looks at Sprite, at me, at the leash, at the needle in my other hand.\n\n\u201cLooks like you\u2019re learning her,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd she\u2019s learning stairs are liars.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is,\u201d I say, and make myself say nothing else, because sometimes silence is the precise word.\n\nMrs. Barlow reaches out a hand as if to touch Sprite and then doesn\u2019t, which is the politest thing anyone has done all day. \u201cMy husband used to say we measure ourselves against the moments we don\u2019t throw away,\u201d she says. \u201cI think he made that up, but he said it like he\u2019d stolen it from a very wise man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the wise man,\u201d I say, and we both pretend for a second that he wasn\u2019t also a hum.\n\nThat night, Sprite sleeps in the crate with the door open. She chooses it the way you choose a closet when you\u2019re tired of being seen. I sit on the couch and my muscles remember their names. The needle sits on the coffee table by the notebook and the lamp and a cup with a chip on the rim that I refuse to throw away because the chip reminds me of a tooth I chipped on a pool edge when I was thirteen and too proud to cry in front of a boy I do not remember. The needle glints and the glint is not magical so much as it is an agreement with light. I write in my notebook: Sprite ran, Sprite returned, I did not fail, not in the obvious way, and then I add: Paw balm. It is a joke. It is also a to-do.\n\nThe next day is a Friday that can\u2019t decide who it wants to be. The sky is flat and the air is busy. I make coffee that tastes like the word reliable and Sprite eats her breakfast with the small smacking noises of someone trying to be polite. At nine, the board meets. I do not know that because anyone told me they start at nine; I know it because nine o\u2019clock feels like a time when people convene to become official. I do not watch the clock, but watching is one of my higher functions and I do not disable it for sport.\n\nAt nine thirty-six my phone rings. It is Katy. I let it ring for a full second and then another because entering a conversation with eagerness is like entering a cold lake: there are better strategies. When I answer, Katy sounds like a woman who knows a lot about hope and distrusts it anyway. \u201cWe talked,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we\u2026 want to move forward with you, with Rocket, but we want to see you with Sprite for a week. Consider it your practicum. Consider it our cover. Consider it whatever makes you feel like we\u2019re not apologizing for human feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour board is concerned with optics,\u201d I say, and I don\u2019t add a question mark because the question is implied.\n\n\u201cThey are concerned with outcomes,\u201d she says, parrying nicely. \u201cSometimes outcomes like to wear optics around the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do a week,\u201d I say. \u201cI can do longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe figured,\u201d she says, and I hear paper. \u201cMrs. Barlow says you have the look of someone who puts her anger away before guests arrive. She meant that as a compliment. The twins\u2019 moms say Sprite looks at you like you invented doors. That was more neutral than it sounds. I told them you said books instead of Netflix and they said, Oh.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople like to file,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cBe a folder,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ll call Monday to schedule a meet. You doing okay? Sprite okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had an incident with a lid and a heroic recovery,\u201d I say, and then realize I said heroic without sarcasm and decide that vocabulary is a living thing. \u201cWe\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\nI hang up and Sprite comes to rest her head against my shin. She knows when the weather shifts in the room. Animals know. They always have. I think of Rocket\u2019s amber eyes, of his name\u2019s promise of speed and the way speed is not what I want. I think of Sprite\u2019s tremble and the fact that bravery is not the absence of fear so much as it is a decision to walk anyway. I scratch behind her ear and she closes her eyes like a curtain.\n\nAt lunch I take Sprite to the small fenced dog area by the park that always seems to collect the sort of people who can narrate a weather system with their eyebrows. There are two dogs inside, a beagle with the energy of a children\u2019s book and a shepherd with knees like opinions. I set a perimeter in my head and then my body. Sprite walks in as if she has been asked to introduce herself and doesn\u2019t speak the language. The beagle gives her a sniff that is almost an argument and then decides she is acceptable. The shepherd ignores her because his ball is more important than anyone alive. The sky is the color of a spoon and the snow has turned to whatever snow turns into when it has had enough of us.\n\n\u201cNew?\u201d asks a woman with a hat that looks like a small creature nested there for warmth and forgot to leave.\n\n\u201cFoster,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d She sucks her teeth in the way that suggests she knows what that is from either side. \u201cShe\u2019s cautious.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe too,\u201d I say, and the woman smiles in the way people smile when they have just made room for you on a bench.\n\nSprite does a small circle and then a larger one and then the kind of darting play bow that is a question, and the beagle answers the way beagles answer everything, with an enthusiasm that is only one notch away from panic. They chase each other in slow loops like those screensavers in the nineties that we all thought were proof that we were future people. The shepherd drops his ball at my feet and looks at me like this is a job interview. I throw it and he brings it back and I throw it again because sometimes the job is easier than you want to admit. Sprite watches us as if we are doing a math problem she will need to solve later.\n\nOn the way home, Mrs. Barlow is in the lobby with a paper bag of something that smells like cinnamon and truth. She has her dog under one arm like a baby that\u2019s learned to eavesdrop. She looks at Sprite and says, \u201cBetter,\u201d and I nod as if she is the board and I am making my case. She slips a small zip-top bag into my hand and says, \u201cHearts,\u201d and I look inside and see a handful of chicken hearts because Mrs. Barlow is not the person you thought she was when you met her hair. \u201cHumans like sprinkles,\u201d she says, answering my face. \u201cDogs like organs. Just little bits. Watch her, though. It\u2019ll change how she looks at you.\u201d\n\nI use one heart that night, and it does change how she looks at me. It is the look of a creature who has seen your knife and trusts it. It is not love. Love is too big a word, a soap bubble as I have said, a thing that pops when pressed. It is a sentence fragment that implies a sentence I might read again.\n\nJune arrives late, cheeks bitten by the air, and sits with her back against my couch and her legs out straight. She has the scarf around her neck and she has knit enough of it that it looks like something and not just ambition. The needle we found sits between us like a small metallic witness. I tell her about the lid and the hallway and the way Sprite uncoiled from herself like a spring that had been warning the world. She listens and then takes my hand with the same softness she uses to take yarn from an overfull basket.\n\n\u201cI am proud of you,\u201d she says, and then immediately makes a face as if the words have embarrassed her with their earnestness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to sound like an aunt in a TV movie. No offense to TV aunts. They always have snacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cMrs. Barlow gave me chicken hearts,\u201d I say. \u201cI think that\u2019s snacks plus agenda.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a witch of the useful sort,\u201d June says. She picks up the needle and holds it parallel to the coffee table and then slowly turns it until it is perpendicular. The lamplight runs along the shaft and gathers at the rose cap and then seems to drift one degree to the left. \u201cDo you feel that,\u201d she asks, and I can\u2019t tell if she means with her skin or her sense of symmetry.\n\n\u201cI felt it in the hall,\u201d I say, which is true and false in different directions. \u201cI don\u2019t want to give it too much. I don\u2019t want to owe it anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d she says, which is exactly the sort of thing I need pointed out. \u201cYou could carry it because it\u2019s pretty and because it reminds you that the world is made on purpose. That\u2019s magic enough. If it starts singing or eating light, we\u2019ll make a plan.\u201d\n\nThe weekend is a test I don\u2019t know I\u2019m taking until it is over. I wake at times I wouldn\u2019t have chosen and stand on sidewalks in air that feels personal. I praise small movements with the fervor of a convert. I discover I do like Netflix now that I have an animal to think about while pretending to watch. I pass the twins\u2019 moms in the mailroom and one of them says, Good morning in a way that is not forced, and the other says, I like her ears, and I say, Me too, with a weight I am surprised by. We pass the man with the lab again and he says, You\u2019re out early, and I say, I\u2019m out, and we both nod as if this explains the universe.\n\nOn Sunday, a snow decides to be a snow. It starts with small, apologetic flakes and then commits, and the city goes into the mode where everything is recognizable and also newly drawn. I take Sprite out and she lifts each paw high like a delicate dancer. We walk past the church with the brick belly and the stained glass that is probably a map to something someone lost. We pass the statue of the Scandinavian man whose expression says he has seen enough winter to ask for a manager. Sprite eats snow and then looks confused when it vanishes as if the world just tricked her on purpose. I laugh with my actual throat and not because I practiced.\n\nIn the afternoon, the shelter holds a volunteer training I promised to attend. I leave Sprite with a frozen Kong that will teach her patience or at least how to resent me generically, and I go to the shelter where the warm feels like breath again. The training is led by a young man with a face like a friendly toaster. He tells us about leash manners and body language and the danger of letting the dogs learn to anticipate only disappointment. He says, We are the pattern and uses his hands to draw a rectangle in the air, and I feel the needle in my pocket warm a fraction of a degree, which is my body being dramatic, not the metal being anything.\n\nAfter, I go to Rocket\u2019s kennel and sit outside it like a supplicant. He is lying with his bariatric head between his paws and his eyes look like someone took amber and added honey and smoke. He gets up and presses his forehead against the bars and I put my hand there and we stand like that for a beat too long. He grumbles a low noise that is not a growl but an opinion. I tell him, I do not own a yard and I do own a soft voice sometimes, and I will try not to make you my experiment, and he licks the place between my index finger and thumb that I always forget is a place.\n\nMonday is light on purpose and heavy on consequence. The board decides to schedule Rocket\u2019s visit for Tuesday, which feels like both too soon and exactly the right amount of time for me to make peace with the fact that I will fail if I measure with someone else\u2019s ruler. I clean the apartment in the way that suggests I am proving something to an invisible auditor. Sprite watches me from the couch with her chin on the armrest, and I tell her that if Rocket comes, I will not let him be the only dog in the room with needs. She yawns huge, shows me the pink cave of her mouth, and collapses into sleep like a small building.\n\nThat night, June brings dinner in a casserole dish that looks like it has fed multitudes of people who wear flannel. We sit at the table because the couch feels too domestic and we are performing something that deserves chairs. The needle lies between salt and pepper like a question. June taps it with the back of her fingernail and it makes a sound that is barely sound. I say, If it is magic, it is the magic that keeps things from unraveling rather than the magic that makes scarves out of nothing. June says, I like both kinds, and I think that is why people tell her their secrets without meaning to.\n\nBefore I sleep, I put my hand on the crate and whisper to Sprite, who is awake with her eyes open just enough to be ready and asleep enough to not have to admit she cares. I tell her that tomorrow another dog will come into the room she has decided is an idea worth keeping. I tell her that I will not break the rules she is knitting under her ribs. I tell her that whatever happens I will not ask her to be an afterthought. My mouth is soft when I say it, but not because I am trying. The needle on the nightstand stares at the ceiling and tells the light where to go. The building hums the way old apartments hum, and maybe that is the only kind of spell that works in a place like this. The cold beyond the glass lines up to be checked at the door in the morning, and I sleep with my hand open, as if I am ready to hold whatever comes and to let it go if that is the kinder thing.",

I get up before the alarm out of a courtesy to possibility. Sprite lifts her head when my feet hit the floor and considers whether I am the kind of person who might move a mountain before coffee. I tell her we\u2019re not moving mountains, only making room. She blinks and rearranges herself into a loaf, which is as close as she comes to trust when she hasn\u2019t been fully introduced to the day. I put the kettle on because my body believes in steam, and I put the needle in my pocket because my mind believes in totems even when it pretends not to.\n\nThe apartment looks like it has been staged by someone who understands story and resents it. The crate sits with its door open, a home that does not ask too much. The rug is anchored under the coffee table to keep it from becoming a slipstream. The bowls are in their corner like punctuation marks waiting for a sentence. I take stock of leashes, of treats, of the small jar of paw balm that says winter will not win without a fight. I rehearse in my head the sequence I learned in training videos and from Katy\u2019s cheerful competence: outside first, parallel walk to shake the electricity out of the air, then inside with gates, with choices, with advantages arranged. If I can plan a client\u2019s expectations, I can plan a dog\u2019s.\n\nJune arrives with weather on her cheeks and a grocery bag with a logo that implies someone cares about ink. She brings coffee from the place she insists tastes like forgiveness and a roll of blue painter\u2019s tape for reasons she refuses to reveal until the reveal is satisfying. She puts the cup in my hand and touches the needle in my pocket with two fingers through the fabric, and the motion is so gentle it feels like a superstition of its own. \u201cWe\u2019re ready,\u201d she says, and I believe her because she has a way of making readiness feel like a cardigan\u2014practical, cozy, knit a stitch at a time.\n\nKaty texts that they are parking, and I say words to Sprite as if each one is padding for the hard parts. The first knock is more a suggestion than a demand, and then a second, as if the knocker knows that people play games with their own doorways. When I open, winter comes inside on Rocket\u2019s coat. Katy has that look of a person trying to convince a situation to stay inside its lines, and Gus carries enthusiasm like a lantern. Rocket recognizes me with his whole face and then his whole body, an equation resolved with a single variable. Sprite recognizes the change in air pressure and turns into a shadow.\n\nWe do the outside first because rules exist to make room for exceptions. The four of us and two dogs parade down the stairwell as if practicing for a domestic comedy I would never agree to be in. Rocket descends with intent, not reckless but convinced. Sprite measures each step for treachery and then willfully steps into it anyway. On the landing we meet the twin mothers, wearing the kind of coordinated parkas that suggest a memorandum. They pause to give us the look that lives in many mothers\u2019 eyes\u2014protective curiosity\u2014and then one of them says, \u201cGood luck,\u201d in a tone that suggests she might, grudgingly, be rooting for the home team. Mrs. Barlow\u2019s door opens a crack as if the building itself is a mouth, and she gives me a nod from inside as if to say, We are all witnesses.\n\nThe world outside has decided to glitter in that insolent way it does when light hits a thousand small facets of cold. We do the parallel walk around the block, a choreography of alignment and relief. Rocket flicks looks at me as if he understands we can transact attention, and when passerby knees appear he chooses me against everything else, which is both flattering and a trap. Sprite stays on my left like a mouse that has decided to be a small horse. She glances at Rocket with the kind of sideways gaze that says I am collecting data to be used later, probably against you.\n\nOn Nicollet, a skateboarder appears the way trouble always appears\u2014sudden, loud, built out of someone else\u2019s joy. Rocket stiffens the way a noun stiffens in a sentence, ready to do something you will later have to excuse. I say his name with a low vowel as if it were a pillow. He flicks his eyes to me and then back to the board as if asking permission to dislike it, and I pay him for the glance with a bit of dehydrated liver that forms the basis of at least three religions in this neighborhood. Sprite tucks herself behind my calf, body making itself into a pencil and then an eraser. I breathe in a way I hope translates to we are trees. The skateboarder disappears and the air remembers how to be air.\n\nBack upstairs, June puts strips of blue tape on the floor like fault lines. \u201cThis is for us,\u201d she says. \u201cVisual cues are as much for people as they are for dogs.\u201d She creates a Z of space between kitchen and living room so that Rocket can occupy one edge and Sprite can occupy the other and neither has to own the middle. I appreciate the geometry of it more than I will admit. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says, \u201cdoorways are treaties. Let\u2019s sign them with our mouths.\u201d She means talk low and look away and make everything seem like something that happens because that is the way of the world, not because we demand it.\n\nRocket enters as if the room owes him an introduction. He beelines to the rope toy, to the couch, to my bookshelf and sniffs the spines as if selecting a life. Sprite chooses the rectangle of blue tape nearest the crate and sets her ribs against it like a barrier she invented. I stay by the sink, gravity for hire. When Rocket\u2019s nose finds the coffee table, he pauses at the needle as all creatures eventually do around small objects that contain a question. He noses it with the care of a thief checking for a tripwire. Then he does the thing Rocket does when his mouth wants to understand the world\u2014he uses it.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d I say, not loud, a comma not a period. I step closer without stepping into, and I trade him a sliver of Mrs. Barlow\u2019s sanctioned organ for the unearned metal. Rocket thinks about justice for exactly two beats and then opens his jaw. The needle drops into my palm with that soft clink metal makes when it is relieved, and Rocket receives the heart and shifts his loyalty accordingly. \u201cGood man,\u201d Gus says, to me or to the dog, and June laughs without making a sound because the exchange is so simple and so complicated at once.\n\nKaty watches in that way she does where her approval is a small lamp. \u201cYou have good timing,\u201d she says. \u201cThat matters more than almost everything.\u201d She looks at Sprite and at my body angled soft in her direction and at Rocket slowly lowering himself into a down on a rug he would like to claim but will not today. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to rush this,\u201d she adds, but she is saying it to the air and the board and the story we keep telling ourselves about how patience is something we own when it is something that owns us.\n\nWe spend an hour in the kind of company that looks easy and is not. We do turns at the water bowl. We practice trading what is not ours to give. We let Sprite look and then look away. June narrates the good the way people narrate a sunrise to children who will not remember the first one they saw but will remember the shape of the voice. Rocket is mouthy in ways that can be redirected; Sprite is brave in increments that make my chest a little tight. When Rocket leans into my knee, my hand finds his chest in that spot where praise becomes a kind of map.\n\nWhen the hour is done, Katy gathers leashes with the elegance of a person who has done this five hundred times and still believes in it. \u201cI\u2019m going to propose a foster-to-adopt for Rocket,\u201d she says, which is a sentence braided out of compromise and hope. \u201cTwo weeks. Sprite can stay through the weekend if that works. Then we bring them both into the shelter for a meet on neutral ground and see whether Rocket comes back here with you Monday night. I want the board to see you managing a transition, not just a moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of moving parts,\u201d I say, because stating the obvious makes people feel invited into the logic. \u201cI can make each part small.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all there is,\u201d she says, which is either wisdom or a plea. \u201cWe\u2019ll check in daily. If anyone\u2019s nervous, we change shape.\u201d She leans closer as she clips Rocket\u2019s leash to his collar. \u201cYou\u2019re good at the between,\u201d she adds. \u201cNot everyone is.\u201d\n\nAfter they leave, the air writes an equation it expects me to solve: one dog and one person and one empty space that still holds the outline of something larger. Sprite comes to sniff the place where Rocket\u2019s body pressed the rug and then lies down there as if trying on someone else\u2019s coat. The blue tape remains, an artificial border that has already taught us something. I peel up one corner and the static crackles satisfyingly. June slides the rest up in clean lengths, winding them around two fingers to create a roll that looks enough like a galaxy to make me smile.\n\n\u201cYou did well,\u201d she says, which is risky only if you assume I do not need to know when I do. \u201cYou didn\u2019t rush. You let your face be what your voice promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cI almost wanted to be seen,\u201d I say, and the room accepts the confession like an old couch bearing fresh weight. \u201cIt\u2019s an odd sensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not a secret,\u201d she says, and then she startles herself with the declarative, cheeks flushing as if she had been caught arguing with a priest. \u201cSorry. That sounded like a banner I knitted with my feelings. It\u2019s just\u2014sometimes people write quiet onto you like a diagnosis and forget that quiet is also an instrument.\u201d\n\nWe take Sprite out again because the world keeps happening even when you think you\u2019ve had a day. The stairwell smells like wet wool and someone\u2019s spicy soup. On the landing, Mrs. Barlow is arranging a pot of something by her door as if spontaneous charity could be left at thresholds like packages. She sees Sprite and puts a hand over her chest as if to keep her heart from running down the hall. \u201cYou met the comet,\u201d she says, and I nod. \u201cHe\u2019ll chew your dictionaries and then spell apology with the bits,\u201d she adds, which is both warning and poem. \u201cYou looked like the sort of woman who keeps sharp things out when necessary. I was not wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the nicest way anyone has called me careful,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re trying on a foster-to-adopt. There are\u2026 steps.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere always are,\u201d she says. \u201cYards are ideas. Doors are real. You make a door he understands, you don\u2019t need a fence.\u201d Her little dog chooses that moment to sneeze as if in agreement, and Sprite wags twice in the restrained way of the newly prudent.\n\nWe make it to Loring under a sky that can\u2019t decide if it is thin or thick. The pond is a memory of water under a skin of light. Sprite attempts to read the wind the way a literate person reads a menu at a restaurant where all the dishes have foreign names and domestic ingredients. I keep my voice low and let her choose how far to go, which is farther than I would have bet in the bet I never placed. A man in a bright orange knit hat passes and says to his phone, \u201cIf they fire Jerry, I\u2019ll eat my socks,\u201d as if the socks had been asked to weigh in, and I think of June\u2019s basket of wool like a pantry.\n\nThat evening holds its breath the way evenings do when the day has been too full of edges. I make a simple dinner that turns the kitchen into a room instead of an exhibit. Sprite curls on the rug, uncoiling now and then to check the borders for leaks. The needle sits on the table near the salt and the notebook and the candle I never light because scent feels like a lie in rooms that have to hold too many truths. When I touch the needle, it is just metal. When I hold it longer, it is still metal. There are kinds of magic that only work if you don\u2019t try to turn them into a tool.\n\nAt nine, the building\u2019s fire alarm shrieks the way a god would if gods resorted to human devices. The sound becomes an organism and enters my ears with purpose. Sprite levitates without leaving the ground. I put one hand on the crate and the other on the counter and say her name in the voice I saved for what if. The hall erupts with concerned feet and pajamaed legs and the smell of someone\u2019s burnt idea. I clip Sprite\u2019s leash with the movement of a person who has practiced clips in rooms that were not on fire. We step into the corridor and join the procession.\n\nOn the stairs, Mr. Thirty-Something With the Lab appears without his lab, eyebrows in their own emergency. He says, \u201cIt\u2019s just a false one, building\u2019s old,\u201d and then winces because that sentence always precedes the day it isn\u2019t. The twin mothers corral two small humans who are delighted to be outside beneath the midnight stadium of alarm. Mrs. Barlow has her robe tightened and her small dog under her arm again, an accessory no one planned but everyone understands. We congregate in the lobby like species who forgot they are supposed to hate crowds. Someone carries a goldfish bowl as if you can evacuate water.\n\nSprite shakes under my hand as if it is in conversation with what the noise believes. I crouch and put my palm on the side of her neck and talk like the heaviest blanket. There is a moment when the sound shifts molecules and you think maybe this is how I begin being the person who cannot hold. Then it drops, or maybe I do. Either way, the alarm hiccups and then changes to a lower, sulkier pitch, and the building staff emerges with apologies and a sheet of paper with instructions printed on it that no one will read later. We go back up as a people who have shared something stupid and therefore feel intimate.\n\nBack in the apartment, I give Sprite one of the hearts because Mrs. Barlow\u2019s weird wisdom is a path even when the lights have been rude. Sprite takes it and then lays down right at the threshold between kitchen and living room, occupying the liminal on purpose as if to claim her agency. The needle lies on the table and I put my fingers on it without asking it to do anything at all. It is cool, then less so. If it holds light, it only holds a little, the way a ring remembers a hand.\n\nWednesday is a mercy, the kind of day that looks like a straight line. I work and walk and repeat until repetition\u2019s cousin shows up and calls itself comfort. The scarf June is knitting has grown enough to drape, and when she sits here its length slides over her knee and onto the floor and pools in a way that reminds me of water that has seen heat. She wears the needle in her hair again, cap glinting like an idea. \u201cFisherman\u2019s rib is for the patient and the stubborn,\u201d she says, eyes on her work. \u201cYou only see it when you pull it, when the fabric has to show you what it\u2019s been hiding.\u201d\n\nIn the afternoon, Katy texts that the board likes a good narrative and I am developing one. I send a picture of Sprite asleep with her face smushed against the crate tray as if trying to see through plastic. Katy responds with a heart and then a sentence that makes something in me warm: They are coming around. When you are the kind of person whose job is to remove friction from systems, it is disconcerting and pleasurable to be told that your existence itself is grease for the squeak.\n\nThursday throws its shoulder into the door and entrances with wind and a sky that has turned theatrical. Snow that is not snow yet tries on shapes above the rooftops like a woman in a dressing room unsure anyone deserves to see her in this dress. I take Sprite to the dog park early and she sniffs all the posts as if reading the morning paper. The shepherd is there again with his ball and a woman I have not seen before, who throws in the unshowy way of someone whose body remembers work. \u201cYou\u2019re the Rocket lady,\u201d she says without preface, and I nod because categories travel faster than facts. \u201cKaty talks about you like you are a can opener,\u201d she adds. \u201cIn a good way. Opens things without cutting anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put that on my resume,\u201d I say, and then I realize that I mean it. When Rocket comes here next, and when we do the exchange at the shelter, and when the board continues to watch and pretend they aren\u2019t, I will hold that image. A useful tool. A safe edge.\n\nFriday dawns in gray wool and modesty. The building coughs itself awake and Sprite yawns and shows me two inches of careful tongue. I intend to keep the day\u2019s temperature gentle, but the world is not waiting for me. At ten, Katy calls with an ask that knocks a piece off my internal arrangement. \u201cWe took Rocket to a family in St. Anthony for a meet this morning,\u201d she says, diplomatically. \u201cThey have a child who is all elbows and hope. Rocket\u2026 decided elbows are sometimes toys. Minor mouthing. No harm. Dad panicked. He\u2019s back in his kennel, and he\u2019s escalated. I hate that word. Can I bring him over in an hour, just to let him regulate in a place that is not made of echoes?\u201d\n\nI look at Sprite, who is chewing on the corner of a blanket as if she is excising an unfortunate design choice, and I calibrate. \u201cBring him,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019ll make new echoes.\u201d\n\nWhen Rocket arrives, his eyes are glassy in that way dogs get when they have been asked to be eighteen different things in seventy minutes. He plants his feet in my entryway as if to ground the house against weather. I set the scene with food on the floor to scatter, with a gate slid into the hallway to make turn-taking a physical reality, with my voice already wearing its cardigan. Sprite watches from the crate with the door open because choice is a kind of medicine. Rocket paces the blue tape that isn\u2019t there anymore and then lies down on the rug that is, and the act is so deliberate it feels performative. June is here because she is always here when the day could go either way, and she sits with her knitting and her stable breath and her single needle that glints and then does not.\n\nWe break the time into pieces and do not ask anyone to hold the whole hour in their mouth. Rocket puts his head under my hand three times and each time I say nothing and each time the saying nothing feels like a sentence. When he rises fast at a sound in the hall, I say his name and step back and he steps into my step, and the little choreography we do is ours. Sprite comes forward to sniff his flank and then steps away before her brain can tell her she is brave, and I let that be the victory. The kitchen smells like chicken and wool and resolute winter, and for a second I want to put the whole moment in amber.\n\nKaty sits with her hands between her knees as if to keep them from betraying her. \u201cThe board will want to see this,\u201d she says, and I hear both regret and relief. \u201cThey want to know he can read the room.\u201d She watches Rocket glance at my face and then at the world and then back to my face and she nods. \u201cHe\u2019s learning subtitles,\u201d she says, and my mouth makes a smile that is not for show.\n\nIn the late afternoon, after Rocket has gone back to his kennel smelling like my floor, the sky finally makes good on its threat and releases a sheet of snow that turns the city into a footnote. I take Sprite out into it and she digs her nose in and snorts like a small horse in clover. The cold operates like a bureaucracy: thorough, relentless, filling every gap. We walk the loop and Sprite looks back at me every six steps as if to confirm I am still a fixed point. I tell her in a voice I believe that I am. If I keep saying it, perhaps I will always be.\n\nSaturday is Butter and yarn and the version of the world where people decide to be human together on purpose. June and I sit by the window and watch the constant small theater of people deciding to be inside or out. The scarf has grown and when she wraps it around my neck to test the drape, it covers my collarbones like it was made in the shape of my reluctance and my wanting. The needle rides her hair like a hairpin that knows things about winter. \u201cI think I can finish this before you sign anything official,\u201d she says. \u201cThat way, if you have to cry, you can do it into something designed to absorb.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t cry on cue,\u201d I say, and then I realize the cue is so often my own, and that makes me quieter than I was a minute ago. \u201cThank you,\u201d I add, because gratitude is a language I try to practice even when my mouth would rather be precise than soft.\n\nBack home, Sprite naps with her mouth slightly open, dream-panting for whatever it is dogs chase in sleep that is not us. I clean as if the board might fall from the ceiling and inspect my baseboards. I sweep up three long strands of June\u2019s hair\u2014stowaways woven from the needle to our days\u2014and a small curl of blue tape that escaped its planet. The refrigerator hums in the tone of a thing that has decided to live forever and probably won\u2019t. The needle sits in the light and takes it but does not hoard.\n\nSunday dawns apocalyptic and then remembers itself. The snow plows conduct their slow dragons outside my window, and I make a list because lists are how I take myself seriously. On it is: return Sprite Monday morning for neutral ground, bring hearts and a sense of humor, do not apologize for not being a yard, remember that doors are real. June texts me a picture of the needle beside a cup of tea and a lemon, the cap\u2019s rose catching lamplight and pretending it invented it. She writes: today we rest our wrists, and I think of all the tendons under my skin associating themselves with a dog\u2019s name they haven\u2019t been told yet belongs here.\n\nMonday is transit and tremble and that antiseptic smell that says, We are going to try to do good and will not always know how. I take Sprite into the shelter with a calm I borrowed from someone else and then made mine. She walks in and flattens a little at the threshold and then remembers about biscuits and takes one like a woman remembering she once loved salt. Rocket is brought out with the performative patience of a very smart child at a museum. We do the dance. We circle, we stop, we do small noses and small nods. Katy looks at me the way a teacher looks at a student who has chosen the right formula without showing her work.\n\nThe board has faces I know and faces I don\u2019t, each holding a different story they tell themselves about who will be good for whom. The twins\u2019 moms are not on the board, but somehow their opinion is present in the air like perfume. Mrs. Barlow is not on the board, but her wisdom about hums and hearts has made a nest in the back of my throat. June stands near the volunteer table like an understudy who learned all the lines and never needed to. Gus holds Rocket\u2019s leash and hums something tuneless under his breath that turns into courage when we decide to call it that.\n\nI do not make a speech because speeches belong to people who need to be heard more than they need to do. Instead, I kneel and show my hand to Rocket and show my side to Sprite and wait until each chooses me in their small way. Rocket\u2019s nose presses the webbing between my thumb and forefinger with that seriousness of a creature who knows about dark rooms and exits. Sprite leans against my calf like a comma. The room watches until it decides it has seen enough. Katy clears her throat in the quiet the way people do when they are about to alter someone\u2019s immediate future.\n\n\u201cWe propose,\u201d she says, and the word is so full I feel my fingers go still. \u201cFoster-to-adopt for Rocket. Transition today, two weeks with check-ins, formal adoption pending continued suitability. Sprite will move to a foster who has her same frequency to avoid bounce. Mara has demonstrated management, intention, and the sort of calm that is not indifference. The board will sign,\u201d she adds, glancing at faces that have been written into this outcome. \u201cIf anyone has an objection, now is the time, and you must bring evidence, not vibe.\u201d\n\nNo one brings anything but relief. The relief looks like people letting their shoulders drop in unison. It looks like Gus smiling so hard his beanie tries to leave his head of its own accord. It looks like a woman in the corner with cat-eye glasses and that purposeful red mouth writing something on a paper form with a pen that leaves a trail like a small river. It looks like me standing because my knees remember how.\n\nThere are logistics that happen next and they all have the satisfying clatter of plates being stacked in the right cupboard. Katy hands me a folder with tabs and the kind of language lawyers like and the kind of white space graphic designers consider generous. Gus claps Rocket on the flank and says, \u201cBe good,\u201d and Rocket looks at him like that word is interesting but not definitive. Sprite is handed to a woman with soft hands and a voice built like a porch, and she says to me, \u201cWe\u2019re just going to borrow her heart for a while,\u201d and I nod because lending is an adult skill I don\u2019t get enough credit for practicing. June squeezes my arm and says nothing because what is there.\n\nWhen we get home, Rocket enters like a problem set I asked for and received. He does a brisk circle of everything and then sits as if he invented it. I remove the leash with ceremony I do not mock. He looks at me and I look at him and there is a moment in which our bodies are a recipe. I put the needle on the table between the plant and the notebook and the small jar of balm for pads that will need it, and it sits there and hums with the building and the winter and the fact of a dog who is not an experiment and not an idea and not a symbol. He is Rocket, which is a ridiculous name and also not, and he puts his head on my knee and then removes it because he suspects he is allowed to do that whenever he chooses, and he wants to be right.\n\nThe evening is practice. I make an aisle of patience between the kitchen and the couch and we walk it back and forth until our feet know the boards. I scatter food on the rug to slow a mouth that has decided urgency is a virtue and then I watch urgency remember that it can be put down without being lost. I let him watch me do nothing for ten minutes, then fifteen, then a stretch that feels like a gift to both of us. The wind slaps the window with an open palm and then tries again as if the city owes it money. The refrigerator hums, and the needle hums along, and I decide to stop deciding whether I am imagining it, because imagining is one of my higher functions and it deserves work, too.\n\nWhen June leaves, she pauses in the doorway and looks at Rocket with the heavy regard she reserves for creatures that have made a case for themselves without words. \u201cBe kind to my friend,\u201d she says to him, which is an unfair assignment and a good one. He looks at her with the amber intelligence he carries like a secret, and then he looks at me. I look back and my face tells on me. It says, I am here. It says, We will walk when the cold says no. It says, I can be a can opener. It says nothing at all, too, because the heart of your ribbing is your intention and mine is becoming a garment I can finally put on without checking the mirror more than once.\n\nThat night, when Rocket curls near the couch with a breath that smells like what dogs smell like when they have been asked to make a life in a place that smells like people, I put my hand on the floor, fingers open, palm cool. He shifts a fraction to put his rib into the space. The needle on the table catches the lamplight like it did the day we found it and then gives it back in a slightly altered shape. If it is magic, it is not the kind that turns straw into gold. It is the kind that keeps fiber from slipping, a small anchor against the weight of intention. The wind rattles the glass, and the building answers with its hum\u2014the same one people in this place have slept to and cursed and learned to love because it is the sound of the world continuing without our permission.\n\nI sleep in a way that remembers without rehearsing. In the gray where the city has not yet put on its voice, Rocket shifts and groans the small groan of a creature who has found a different answer for what it means to be safe. I reach for the needle on the table and do not touch it. My hand hangs in the air and makes a shape I recognize from other lives I\u2019ve tried\u2014reaching without needing, offering without insisting. When morning comes, the cold will still be itself, ambitious and unsentimental. We will put on boots. We will put on courtesy. We will open a door. We will walk anyway.",

                              "content": "The first week with Rocket rubs itself into the apartment the way a new scent insists on being part of the narrative. He is mouthy in the morning and philosophical by afternoon, a dog who decides each sound in the hallway deserves a footnote but not a war. I portion the day into gates and games and pauses because that is how my brain forgives both of us. At seven we step into the tundra together and I show him where the city keeps its corners. At noon we scatter food into the rug so his urgency has something granular to argue with. At four we practice doorways the way some people practice scales, my hand hovering on the knob and his body remembering that stillness is an action. There is a click that happens in him when a rule makes sense, and each time I hear it I feel something in me loosen the way a jar lid does when you run it under hot water even though the internet swears it\u2019s a myth.\n\nHe learns my apartment as if he has been hired to draw a map. He has strong opinions about the bathmat and none at all about the couch until he does. He tries to memorize my hands. I try to memorize his breath. When the building hiccups\u2014a radiator-esque shudder in the vent, a neighbor finding hilarity at a volume usually reserved for theater\u2014he lifts his head and asks me whether this will be a thing. I say, Not for us, and because I make my voice a soft bridge, he walks across it. The needle sits on the table or in my pocket depending on how superstitious I need to be, which is to say, more than before and less than people who talk to crystals in the cleansing aisle at the co-op. When I roll it between my fingers, the metal is ordinary until I stop demanding. After that, it is still ordinary, but I notice the way my skin recognizes weight and chill and the small hum of being alive enough to hold something at all.\n\nWork tries to be offended at my focus and fails because I am still the person who answers email with an economy that borders on the athletic. I take calls and redirect clients and move commas into places that keep sentences from tripping over their own confidence. When someone on the Bergstrom account asks if we can \u201cspin\u201d a delay, I say, We can sequence truth into palatable portions, which is an answer that makes our CFO sound proud in public and worried in private. Rocket sleeps under the table with his body touching the side of my foot in a way that would be possessive if it weren\u2019t so precise. When he dreams, his paws do the ghost of running and his lips move around the name of whatever he was before this, and I look at the needle glinting beside my mouse and think about names as instructions and invitations.\n\nKaty checks in via text with the brevity of a person who knows what she needs to know and would rather be mopping than typing. Her questions are plain: countersurfing, mouthiness, triggers, appetite, elimination, energy after five p.m. I answer without theater and with enough detail to be useful. I say, He is a man who needs a job and I am an employer who understands onboarding, and she sends back a line of clapping hands that looks ridiculous and feels earned. Sprite\u2019s foster sends two photos and a caption that says, She is playing more and eating in a straight line, which is the sort of sentence that, if you don\u2019t know dogs, sounds like nothing and, if you do, sounds like prayer.\n\nThe second Tuesday after Rocket moves in the world does a Minnesota thing where the sky decides to be a lid and the wind commits to coming from exactly the direction of your face no matter which way you turn. I put a salve on Rocket\u2019s paw pads with a flourish that makes him look at me as if I have given him jewelry. He licks it off with careful consideration and then looks at me as if to ask if this ointment was designed for taste, and I tell him not everything needs to be a success in every axis. We go out anyway to the part of Loring Park where the snow piles at the corners like patient beasts. A squirrel makes a bad decision on a branch above us and then corrects it in a manner that would inspire a triathlon coach. Rocket locks into stillness that is not silence. His body becomes a sentence that ends with an exclamation point no one else wants to read out loud.\n\nThis is where I learn to make my voice different than my hands. I do not tighten the leash because I have watched enough videos to know what that says. I plant my feet without staking, and I let the line between us become slack enough to be honest. Rocket flicks his eyes to that slack as if it is a new dialect, then to my knee as if it speaks, then back to the squirrel whose tail calls him a liar about his restraint. I whisper leave it as if it were a bedtime story and pay him for the glance with something that used to be a fish. He takes the fish and does not break the world. A man in a snowmobile suit with a face like a surprised tomato says, Good boy, to the dog and then to me as if the compliment can be transferred, and I accept both as if I earned them, which, today, I did.\n\nJune obsesses over the scarf with the kind of cheer that is better than zeal. She brings it when she comes, wrapped around her neck until she decides Rocket has forgotten that textiles can be not-toys. She knits around him the way water moves around a rock that is trying to remain completely itself. The fisherman\u2019s rib grows like low tide, ridges and rests. Sometimes she counts under her breath and the numbers form the outline of a lullaby. Sometimes she tells me about her day at the co-op where a woman demanded that the oranges apologize for being from far away, and the way the barista at Butter has decided to learn the names of everyone who braves this part of winter in a hat that covers only the top third of their ears. She says this city is a competition between people who will out-stubborn the cold and people who find ways to sneak warmth into corners it doesn\u2019t belong, and I tell her she only likes competitions she knows she can win.\n\nThe needle becomes a member of this household in a way that would embarrass a rational inventory. It travels from the table to my pocket to the dish by the door where keys and sharp things live. June wears it in her hair when she\u2019s here and sometimes, when she is not, I hold it and think it knows which one of us is the witch and which one is the experiment. If it does an occult thing, it does it in that quiet register where heating vents mutter at two a.m. and refrigerators confess that they are tired. Twice I think I feel a warmth that is not my hand\u2019s doing when I am the only one awake and Rocket comes and puts his chin on the edge of the couch and breathes in my direction as if reminding me that oxygen is a communal act.\n\nMy mother calls in a burst of winter daylight, the way she does when boredom meets concern in the middle of an article she did not finish. She wants to know whether I have changed my mind about Netflix, whether my building is salt-friendly, whether I am using a prong collar that a friend\u2019s friend swears saved her marriage, whether water left on a stove unattended can cause the sort of systemic issues a person sees on TikTok if she is not careful about following young women who speak with a conviction that does not seem to be attached to facts. I tell her my collar is leather and intention. I tell her I stand in the kitchen when I boil water because the kettle deserves company the way a newborn does. I tell her that Rocket\u2019s mouth belongs to both of us and to neither of us depending on who is watching and whether they own a board seat.\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean,\u201d she asks, and I think of her thumbs on links, of her faith in the headline and her skepticism of me, and I say, It means I am doing fine. She hesitates and then says, I read a study about dogs increasing cardiovascular health in women over forty, and I say, I\u2019m not over forty, and she says, I know, and I hear inside it the small apology of a person who doesn\u2019t know how to be proud without sounding like an insurance brochure. When we hang up, I look at Rocket and say, Today you\u2019ve made me a data set, and he sits as if to acknowledge his role in my longevity.\n\nThe trainer arrives on a Thursday when the world has decided to be glass. Her name is Alina and she is slender in the way of willow branches capable of withstanding a storm. She brings a pouch that smells like a decision, and she looks at me the way people trained to teach look at people trained to pretend they don\u2019t care about approval. She asks for my philosophy and I say, Intention, consistency, exchange, and she nods as if we have agreed on a tax rate. We spend an hour reinforcing Rocket\u2019s ability to choose me against the thrill of the hallway, the flirtation of the trash can, the myth of the window as portal. Alina says, He\u2019s a mouth on legs, he needs a job he can hold in his teeth, and I buy rope toys that are not barnyard animals so he will not feel like he is chewing on narratives we do not subscribe to.\n\nWe practice impulse control with a game called It\u2019s Your Choice that sounds like a dangerous party and is actually an introduction to consent. Rocket learns that hands closed are opportunities and hands open are compliments, that looking away gets you more than lunging forward, that sometimes the treat is the fact that I waited with you and did not rush your thinking. When he flubs it, which he does because he is a mammal and impatient when hungry, I take a breath that is not dramatic and try again. When he knocks it out of the park, Alina\u2019s eyebrows do a small dance of satisfaction and I feel something like heat behind my ribs that I do not name because naming makes me want to run from the room.\n\nThere is a night where the building decides to go dark and stay that way longer than \u201coops\u201d usually lasts. The heating is as stalwart as our landlord\u2019s emails can make it, but the lights leave until the emergency ones remember their job. The hallway becomes a shadow with boundaries. The apartment turns into a texture you feel with shin and hip. Rocket takes the lack of light as a puzzle that is mostly corners. He bumps a chair leg and discovers it is not a threat. He sniffs the bottom of the bookshelf and finds a secret stash of pine dust I did not realize had lodged there, and he sneezes like a man who has offended himself. I gather candles like a person who has accidentally become an ancestor. June appears with a thermos of soup and a headlamp and the scarf half-done, and she plants herself on my floor as if she has claimed squatter\u2019s rights on my good intentions.\n\nWe eat by the kind of light that makes faces look kinder, and June tells me more than I know about the needle. She took it back to Fixations and held it up to the cat-eye teacher like a small offering to a sensible goddess. The woman squinted at the rose cap and said, \u201cThat\u2019s older than it looks and younger than it pretends,\u201d which is a sentence June has been waiting to say back to me all evening. The teacher ran her fingernail along the shaft and said there is a story about a pair like that, a set made in a little workshop in Duluth by a woman whose husband was lost on Superior in a storm with a name and a song. Supposedly she cast the needles out of scrap collected from the docks and filed them smooth with grief and salt. People said they held stitches that wanted to escape. People said they warmed under a certain kind of hand. People say a lot of things about women who keep their lives as if they were tools.\n\nJune laughs and tells me not to marry myself to all of it because legend is a thing that happens when facts get tired and feelings refuse to go to bed. Still, when she passes the needle from one hand to the other in the candlelight, it glows like a practical thing that knows it is being watched. Rocket chooses that moment to lay his head on my foot and sigh the sigh that feels like a calendar turning. The power comes back with the sound of a city remembering itself, and the light is rude after the soft. The candle sputters, and the needle goes back to being metal on a table between a plant that thrives despite and a jar of salve that smells like herbs and hope.\n\nIn the daylight after, I stand with Rocket in the dog park and talk to the man with the lab, whose name turns out to be Colin and whose headband choice tells me he has accepted that ears are not masculine or feminine but simply cold. He tells me he works nights at a hospital where people come in with problems that feel like end-of-world until they are solved with a warm blanket and an apology, and I tell him I help people give themselves permission to change their minds and then call it strategy. He throws the ball and his lab returns it like an apology accepted. We practice recall with Rocket while Sprite\u2019s foster texts me a picture of her asleep between a child\u2019s feet, her paws tucked like hands. I tell Rocket that being loved by a stranger is not a crime, and he wags like he understands both grammar and grace.\n\nThere is a day when Rocket decides the vacuum is, in fact, a demon, and we negotiate a peace treaty that involves turning it on in another room and paying him for breathing like he doesn\u2019t want to call an attorney. There is a morning where he gets the zooms so violently the rug tries to leave the building by itself, and I laugh in the way that uses the part of the stomach I try not to remember exists. There is an afternoon where I cry without permission while watching a video of an old man being surprised with a puppy, and Rocket comes and puts his head on my lap and then removes it when I say, Enough, as if he understands that kindness is sometimes the space between us and sometimes the weight.\n\nMrs. Barlow becomes a source of advice and protein as if she has been waiting all winter for someone to take seriously her inventory of the heart. She knocks at civilized hours with small containers of gizzards as if she is collecting my refrigerator\u2019s gratitude. She tells me stories about her husband and the hum that he left, about the way he would stand in rooms he\u2019d built and listen before he let anyone enter because a building tells you what you made it into if you give it a minute. I think of my father then, and the way he stood in a garage full of pine and Danish oil and believed in straight lines because they did not require anyone else to consent. He liked dogs the way people like coffee\u2014ritual, necessary, not particularly interesting as individuals. When I was eight I made a leash out of a shoelace for a neighbor\u2019s cat and declared that I would walk her; the cat shredded my plan and my forearm with the calm of a creature uninterested in metaphors. My father said, \u201cYou can\u2019t make a companion out of something that does not choose you,\u201d and then he said, \u201cYou can make a system out of anything if you\u2019re stubborn,\u201d which probably explains how he loved us.\n\nThe board does not vanish when the adoption move from conditional to almost. They like updates with an air of clinical affection, as if they once lost a dog to the very thing they did not notice and have decided the noticing now will save everyone else. We send them videos of Rocket choosing me in banal situations: the doorbell, the clatter of a pot, the crackle of the radio when NPR decides to let jazz in before dinner. Katy calls me on a Sunday morning with, \u201cThe board is ready to stop pretending they are in charge of something they cannot own,\u201d which is one of her ways of saying that she will put the adoption form in my hand on Tuesday if nothing catastrophic happens between now and then. I tell her that I do not do catastrophe as a hobby and she laughs as if it is healthy to lie to one another sometimes.\n\nOn Monday a coyote moves like a whisper across the far edge of the park as if it is a rumor invented by winter. Rocket stands so still I think he has become part of the rail. In that breath where instinct and training meet, the leash is a suggestion and my voice is a bridge. I say his name and it is a word that could be anything, and he looks at me and the coyote becomes the end of someone else\u2019s sentence. We stand together long enough for me to memorize it. The coyote glances our way once, bored by our civility, and then disappears into the kind of brush city designers pretend doesn\u2019t harbor anything wild. I do not tell Rocket he is a good boy because the praise feels like the wrong currency. I touch his neck and then remove my hand and we walk home and the needle in my pocket is warm enough to make me think about science and then decide, for once, not to.\n\nThat night I lie on the floor with Rocket because sometimes sitting on a couch makes a room behave like a living room and there are evenings where you need a gymnasium instead. He sprawls with his long legs in ways that defy geometry, his body ridiculous and handsome. I tell him about the board, about signatures, about how paper can be a wedding and how I am not the marrying kind unless you count promises made on Tuesdays. He blinks at me as if he understands more about bureaucracy than he wants to and then sighs the sigh of a creature who is tired of his own bones. The needle sits on the table between the plant and the notebook and the jar of balm, and for a second I do think I see the lamplight bend toward it just the way June swears it does, and then the refrigerator hums and the heat kicks in and the city inhales and exhales and I accept that intention is a garment we knit daily and that sometimes the stitches hold because women somewhere made needles out of grief and metal and courage and said, This is how you keep something from coming undone.\n\nWhen Tuesday comes in wearing ash and the rumor of sun, I put on boots that make me look more practical than I feel and a hat we bought together at a pop-up that existed for exactly four days. June meets me at the shelter because she refuses to let bureaucratic joy be mine alone, and she hands me the scarf in a fold that amounts to ceremony. It is heft and rib and repetition and the kind of softness that makes a face remember it has muscles capable of smile without rehearsal. I wrap it around my neck and it becomes a sentence that ends with a period that is also a promise. Katy puts the form in front of me and a pen in my hand and says, \u201cYou can always say no,\u201d and my mouth does not even pretend to understand. I sign the line that is ridiculous and not, my last name writing itself the way it did on checks I wrote my landlord and letters I never mailed.\n\nThe city is still cold and indifferent when we step back into it with a dog who is now not just practice but fact, and that is good because weather should not be sentimental just because I am. I carry the folder like something that can break even though it is only paper and implication. Rocket looks up at me with his gold-glass eyes and then at the door, which is the real thing in the end. We open it together and the air makes its case against comfort and we say, Noted, and we walk anyway because we have already rehearsed this so many times it would be an insult to our past selves not to. The needle rides in my pocket against the fisherman\u2019s rib like a bit of ore remembering heat, and when we cross Hennepin and the bus hisses and a child points and a woman in a green parka says, \u201cThat\u2019s a handsome creature,\u201d I do not say thank you to only the dog. I say it to the city, to the cold, to the board, to the neighbors who updated their files about me, to June who believes in superstition only when it is useful, to the woman in Duluth who maybe made these needles out of mourning and brass, and to the part of me that was waiting in a hallway weeks ago and learned to make a space exactly the right size and to hold it without shaking.",

I wrap it around my neck in the morning and it tells my face what kind of softness to wear. Rocket comes to check that the scarf hasn\u2019t become an animal, sniffs the wool like it could be a cousin, and then nose-bumps my hand as if to remind me that we have a contract with the day. The needle rides in my pocket like an idea with a weight to it, and occasionally I will forget it entirely until my fingers find it there and everything in me does the small adjustment you do when you realize you\u2019re carrying something breakable and also, somehow, unbreakable. This is how objects train you, gently and then not.\n\nThe week after the signature turns into a rhythm that is not routine so much as a stitched piece with slippage and recovery built in. I learn Rocket\u2019s tells. He gulps air when he is about to decide between impulse and me; his left ear twitches when he is thinking hard about pretending to be taller; he sighs with that theatrical dog exhale when I ask for anything he believes is beneath us. We make a truce with the vacuum. We make a game out of not rushing the door. We make Loring Park ours in increments until the angles of the bridge and the way the birches collect their own shadows become part of the language we speak to each other without saying anything. He picks up a stick the length of a thesis and looks at me like he has taken up sport, and I pay him for dropping it with a bit of salmon that makes his eyes do a religious thing. If this is worship, it is the kind where both worshippers are a little embarrassed by their own sincerity.\n\nJune\u2019s scarf grows in the gaps of my days and travels with her like a tutelary spirit. She wears it at Butter and at Fixations and once, scandalously, to a meeting at the co-op where a man in a fleece vest told her it made her look \u201cvery artisanal,\u201d which she relayed to me with an expression that asked me to invent a polite word for idiot. The needle comes with her, threaded through her hair with the rose cap winking like an eavesdropper, and the two together look more like a set than any of us intended. When she sits at my table, she sometimes takes the needle out of her hair and rolls it on the wood and says, I have a ridiculous suggestion, and because she is June I say, Yes, before she has even finished her breath.\n\n\u201cWe should go to Duluth,\u201d she says, and my brain does an inventory labeled Risk under which it lists: February, highway visibility, the lake\u2019s reputation for collaboration with tragedy, the state patrol\u2019s opinion of my tires, the fact that I once claimed I was allergic to road trips because they ask for a kind of sitting that feels like surrender. June\u2019s eyes are on my face like she is knitting me and this is the row where something complicated slips into rib.\n\n\u201cTo look at water that is pretending to be rock?\u201d I ask, buying time with sarcasm\u2019s small coins.\n\n\u201cTo take this needle to its cousin,\u201d she says, and taps the rose cap on the table lightly enough that the sound is more suggestion than percussion. \u201cThe cat-eye teacher swears there\u2019s a woman in Duluth named Ruth or Roz or possibly Renata\u2014I wrote it down\u2014whose aunt swore up and down she had the mate to this. She runs a shop near the shore that sells mending supplies and whiskey stones and those cards that look like they were printed in 1954. The story about the needles started up there. If we bring it,\u201d she touches the needle the way you touch a friend\u2019s shoulder to move them out of traffic, \u201cmaybe something will feel right. Or maybe we\u2019ll eat pie that tastes like a weather report and come home.\u201d\n\nA trip is a disruption. A disruption is a test and also the thing that shows you what your life is made of when you shake it. Rocket\u2019s seatbelt harness arrives in a cardboard box that has opinions about tape. He sits while I adjust it to his chest and then moves his head left and right like a man in a barbershop who enjoys the attention but not the cape. He tolerates boots in theory and then plucks them off in practice like bad arguments. Mrs. Barlow watches me parade down the hall with treats, leash, bags, spare leash, collapsible water bowl, little packet of coffee for the road as if we are leaving for a week and not a night, and she says, \u201cYou\u2019re packing like a woman who knows love may require a backup plan,\u201d and presses two hearts into my palm as if I could confuse this journey with a blood ritual without her assistance. The twins\u2019 moms meet us at the elevator and offer to bring in packages if anything arrives, and the smaller twin says, \u201cWill the lake be mad?\u201d in the quaver of childhood that holds the truth, and I say, \u201cIt\u2019s not a mood so much as a geography,\u201d which she accepts because children adore questionable metaphors when they come wrapped in certainty.\n\nThe drive north is a corridor of white and sky, a meditation neither of us asked for and both of us accept. Rocket takes the back seat like a man who does not understand why the front is not for all good boys, and then settles with his chin on the armrest as if this gives him the best angle to judge my choices. June narrates the world outside as if it\u2019s a training exercise for us and the landscape. She says, \u201cBirches on the right, field on the left, ghost barn at twelve,\u201d and Rocket lifts his head at ghost as if he has seen one and would like to be consulted before we decide not to stop. The highways are a series of agreements between our tires and a god named Friction. We pass a billboard reminding us that people who speed will die and another telling us that a diner we cannot see has pie the size of regret. We stop in Hinckley for gas and the kind of bathroom break that makes you question how human beings managed before indoor plumbing was a promise. Rocket steps out into the station\u2019s slush and looks around with his whole face like someone dropped him into a novel and forgot to provide a summary of earlier chapters.\n\nBy the time we crest the hill where the lake becomes the horizon\u2019s occupation, my chest does that thing it always does at bodies of water that pretend to be everything at once. Superior lies like a sheet of metal hammered mostly flat and then bent by a force that did not care about flattery. The air shifts temperature in a way that does not feel like permission. The holiday lights strung across Downtown Duluth are tattered and still glowing at two p.m. because that is the sort of city this is in February. The aerial lift bridge flexes itself as if the muscles under its structure can remember summer. I do not tell anyone that this makes me want to cry in a small way that calls for a dark bar and a song about ships.\n\nJune\u2019s directions take us to a storefront painted the green of old glass. Above the door a sign declares, in a font that feels like a handshake, Thread & Tackle, which makes me stupidly happy. Inside it smells like waxed canvas, honey, wood shavings, and the kind of paper that has heard stories. There are bins of darning eggs and odd hooks, little rows of metal clips for unknown uses, candle stubs labeled Storm, and a glass case with thimbles that could belong to saints or seamstresses. June\u2019s needle in my pocket warms the way small things do when you are about to make them part of a plot. The woman behind the counter is gray in the way of driftwood, focused in the way of surgeons, and her name tag says R. Linn in tidy letters like she would enjoy your penmanship if you brought it to her to assess.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for a rumor,\u201d June says, because she should always go first when rumors are involved. \u201cSomething about a needle with a rose at the end that belongs to a story that started with a storm. We have one,\u201d she adds, and touches my pocket as if it were a reliquary.\n\nR. Linn lets her face do the minute shift that reads as interest if you come from a city and grudging delight if you come from a town. She says, \u201cMy aunt told me enough stories about that pair to ruin several family dinners,\u201d and motions us closer to the case where the most beautiful useless things live. \u201cSupposedly a woman named Marion\u2014no last name in the version I like\u2014made herself a pair out of scrap and stubbornness after the lake failed to return her man. She used them to knit through a winter that had more endings than beginnings. The needles held everything she couldn\u2019t. When she died, one went to her sister and one went to the neighbor who kept coming by with casseroles that didn\u2019t help. They drifted. People kept losing one and passing the other, as if the pair refused to live together too long. People who believe in magic call them the Duluth Roses and attribute all kinds of nonsense to them: warmth, luck, a way of keeping tension honest. People who believe in grief call them what they are: metal that reminds you of a person who didn\u2019t come home.\u201d\n\nI take the needle from my pocket and lay it on the glass. In this light the rose cap looks more thorn than bloom, more practical than pretty. R. Linn raises an eyebrow in a way that tells me she has decided I am either serious or insufferable. She reaches under the counter and produces a cigar box that once belonged to a man who thought cigars were an identity. Inside, nestled in cotton that has known damp, lies a needle that could be the twin of mine, minus a notch tiny as a bitten nail on the cap\u2019s outer petal. June inhales like she has been waiting to breathe since November. I put our needle next to the one in the cotton, and there is no alchemy, no spark that leaps between them, only the feeling you get when a missing bracket arrives at the end of a line of code.\n\n\u201cMay I?\u201d R. Linn asks, and there is something between curiosity and caution in the request. I nod, and she picks each needle up in turn, like a person measuring weight in their palms who has measured jewels and hammers both. \u201cMy aunt swore if you held one too long you\u2019d dream in the lake\u2019s vocabulary,\u201d she says, and smirks a little so we all know pedigree is not the point. She puts them together, cap to cap, and for a moment a loop of cold sweeps the hairs along my wrist into attention, the way a door opens and winter comes in to look around. It could be the weather sneaking in through the seam of the old windows. It could be that when you expect anything, your body obliges with a fiction it is happy to believe. It could be nothing.\n\nJune holds her hand out for the twin and closes her fingers around it with the reverence she saves for dough rising correctly and babies\u2019 first laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s warmer,\u201d she says, and then, because she is conscientious about not becoming a clich\u00e9, adds, \u201cIt\u2019s probably body heat and the fact that your shop is at seventy-two degrees, which is a sin in February and also a kindness.\u201d She hands it to me and I feel how smooth the shaft is from use, the minute tackiness at the grip from oils that had a name once and now have a story. If there is anything in it beyond metal, it is restraint, that particular Minnesota knack for being magic without being showy.\n\n\u201cAre there rules?\u201d I ask, halfway mocking, halfway the way you ask for instructions when a stranger puts a baby into your arms and walks out of the room.\n\n\u201cNone that don\u2019t sound idiotic when spoken out loud,\u201d R. Linn says. \u201cDon\u2019t break them. Don\u2019t brag about them. Don\u2019t sell them to anyone who calls themselves a collector. Don\u2019t use them to pierce ears. Do your mending. Be stubborn only when it is useful. If you knit with them, knit thick enough to slow your mind down. If you carry one, remember your pocket is not infinite.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come to keep it,\u201d June says, as if the needle could be hearing. \u201cWe came to know if our superstition is an orphan.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrphans make their own families,\u201d R. Linn says, and I add her to the list of women I would choose to be in charge of something that would otherwise be ruined by people trying to help. \u201cYou can take this one for a day. Bring it back tomorrow by ten. The lake hates hoarders and people who sleep late.\u201d She wraps the twin in paper that makes a torn-silk sound and hands it to June with the small nod of someone who knows you\u2019ll honor the agreement.\n\nWe go down to the lake because if you are this close and you do not, the city will spit you out. The air is the kind of clean that threatens. The ice makes a sound that is more report than music, an enormous creature flexing under a sheet. Rocket stands with his paws splayed and considers the big body of water as if it is the world\u2019s bath he has no intention of participating in. He lifts his nose and samples whatever is blowing off Superior and his mouth does that thing dogs\u2019 mouths do when they are trying to translate a language that is mostly mineral. We walk along the shore where other people have written their names in boot prints, and June slips the borrowed needle out of her pocket and holds both needles in one fist like a promise.\n\n\u201cWhat would we do if they did something.\u201d She squints like she is trying to look at an eclipse indirectly.\n\n\u201cProbably pretend they didn\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cWe are very polite. Plus, you\u2019d ruin your sleeves if the lake decided to be dramatic.\u201d\n\nWe stand with the whole white world pretending to be a photograph and I do, for a second, feel warmth radiate up through my palm where our needle rests. It could be the wind cutting into the angle between glove and sleeve making the rest of me feel colder by contrast. It could be the fact that June\u2019s shoulder is pressed into mine and she runs warm in February by habit. It could be that the lake approves of nothing and everything but takes pity on women who came to recognize something without trying to own it. Rocket leans against my leg as if to anchor my thinking, and when the ice makes a cracking sound far out that runs like a rumor beneath our feet, he watches the water and then watches me and chooses not to be afraid. His choice prevents mine.\n\nWe check into a hotel that sells itself on the promise of views and hot water that arrives when you ask for it. Rocket demurs at the elevator and then decides claustrophobia is for dogs who don\u2019t have a job. In the room he does the circle everything instinct demands, then settles with his head toward the door and his back toward the window like a creature born from both migration and duty. June leans in the frame and watches him with her hands folded around the twin needles, one wrapped, one not, as if she is at a wedding no one else is invited to but the bride and groom prefer it that way. We eat sandwiches that taste like compromise and exhaustion and a mustard that woke up on the right side of the jar. June avoids the hotel Bible in the drawer as if she will be recruited if she touches it. I put the needles on the windowsill and the dusk light finds their metal the way it finds certain leaves in summer and convinces them they are more important than the tree for a moment.\n\nAt night the lake\u2019s sounds grow weird. There is a lontananza to ice groaning, a sense that time doesn\u2019t belong to clocks. Rocket rises at some ungodly hour and licks my fingers as if I have left my hand out for weather. I sit up and my body conforms to the fact that sleep is a loan and he is asking interest. We stand at the window looking out at the black where white lived all day. June murmurs from her half of the room, the content of the murmur not intended for human translation. I realize I\u2019m smiling in the dark and that my face can do that without being told.\n\nIn the morning the city is in its bones again. We take Rocket to a strip of park where the snow plows have made new geography, and he investigates what other dogs have decided about Duluth\u2019s early hours. A woman with a husky passes and says, \u201cBy April your dog will be part iceberg,\u201d and I say, \u201cHe thinks he is now,\u201d and the husky laughs in husky, which is to say he sneezes with a flourish. We bring coffee to Thread & Tackle because courtesy is an easier version of worship and hand the twin needle back to R. Linn, who takes it without ceremony and tucks it into the box like a bird returning to a quiet nest. She looks at us as if we are more and less than she expected and says, \u201cKnock on wood when you get home,\u201d and then, as an afterthought somehow larger than the original thought, she slides something small across the counter toward me.\n\nIt is a tiny rose cap, twin to our needles\u2019 but with a hairline crack you can feel with your thumb and not see in this light. \u201cFell off a cousin once,\u201d she says. \u201cMy aunt keeps the other that matches. These like to go wandering. Sew it onto your scarf if you dare make my aunt roll in her grave. Or put it in your pocket and let it bother you. That\u2019s what objects are for.\u201d\n\nThe drive back is quieter because satisfaction is a softer weather than hope. Rocket sleeps for an hour and then wakes and watches the trees step backward. June rests her head against the window and pretends to nap while counting stitches in her head, and every now and then I see her hand go to her hair out of habit to touch the needle that is not there. I think about Marion, whether she is a story we need or a person who needed work, whether needles are the correct manifestation for grief, whether a man lost in a lake ever stops crossing someone\u2019s home in the night. I think about my father with his shop light and his bloodless knuckles and the way he always preferred tools made of things that did not rust and how he said once, when he was tired and honest, that water frightened him because it could ruin a plan without even trying.\n\nWe reach Minneapolis as if the city has agreed to be rediscovered. The buildings shrug themselves into their corners. The street where my apartment lives is plowed into obedience. Mrs. Barlow is in the lobby conducting a distribution of something that smells like cinnamon and democracy. She sees the folder under my arm and the needle in my pocket spills heat like a secret. \u201cYou still have your faces,\u201d she says to both me and June. \u201cThat\u2019s key.\u201d Her little dog looks at Rocket with hauteur and then with a small secret nod as if the lake applied some polish and he approves of the shine.\n\nIn my apartment, the scarf goes over the back of the chair because it deserves a chair. The rose cap sits in the dish with my keys like an orphan waiting to be adopted by my fingers. The needles\u2019 hum joins the apartment\u2019s hum, and while I still refuse to call it anything but comfort, there is an adjustment to the silence that has nothing to do with the refrigerator. Rocket walks the perimeter and then comes to sit in front of me and does the concentrated look dogs do when they have decided to learn your face. I reach into the dish and take the rose cap and press it into the scarf\u2019s rib where I will feel it with my throat on mornings when my voice would rather be precise than kind. June stands behind me and slides one hand along my shoulder as if positioning me under a skylight and says, \u201cYou went to the lake and you did not burst into flame. I call that progress.\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019ve always suspected flames are more of a summer problem,\u201d and tug the scarf into place and my mouth gives me away without my permission.\n\nThere is a Monday when work demands I make a presentation to people who sell packaged optimism for a living. Rocket watches me rehearse in the apartment with that attentive boredom that lets me repeat myself without feeling ridiculous. When I leave for the office, he flops into a shape that says, I am not abandoned, I am waiting, and I believe him. The conference room is a glass aquarium of men whose faces have learned all the ways to be interested without being available. I do the dance with the slides and the quiet and the data arranged like furniture, and I watch the way they hold their pens, the way their shoulders go from polite to engaged and back, and I notice that my voice has learned a way to be kind to me while being persuasive to them. When they ask about timelines and I tell them the truth in palatable portions, one raises an eyebrow and says, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotten softer,\u201d as if I am bread or a body, and I say, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten accurate,\u201d and let the needle in my pocket warm me past rage.\n\nBy the time March leans into us, the city is making little hissy noises at its own edges. The snow banks have lost their innocence and gained dirt and footprints and the peculiar garbage that rises from winter like a confession. Rocket has learned the scent map of our block and occasionally stands in the hall staring at the elevator in the way of a person who wants to go to the roof and yell into the wind that has ignored him so far. Sprite thrives in photos my phone delivers: asleep with a toddler\u2019s foot touching her flank, nose buried in a blanket in a way that says the world can wait, sitting like an uncertain queen on a soft chair that belongs to a grandmother who writes me that she has never seen such determined politeness in an animal. We send Rocket\u2019s face back to the shelter sometimes anyway, because people like to be invited to happy as if it was their idea.\n\nOn a night when the temperature pretends to be magnanimous, June and I sit on my floor with the scarf across both our laps and the needle beside us and a map of Duluth open on the coffee table because we like to commemorate our adult decisions like children: here is where we stood and did not cry, here is where we bought coffee and felt capable, here is where the man in the orange hat said a sentence that still makes us ridiculous with laughter when we say it out loud. Rocket lies with his back against us and does the thing where his lungs push into our thighs when he breathes. June takes the rose cap out of the dish and sews it into the scarf\u2019s edge with five tiny stitches, a code no one else will read. When she knots the thread and bites it off, she says, \u201cThis is the part where I usually make a wish and pretend I don\u2019t believe in doing that,\u201d and then she looks at me with a face that is both my mirror and the person in the mirror who can look you in the eye.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, because people with wishes are messy and I have just gotten the apartment back into its shape.\n\n\u201cI wish for nothing dramatic,\u201d she says, as if that keeps the gods disinterested. \u201cI wish for slow mornings and the kind of luck that is indistinguishable from work. I wish for Rocket\u2019s breath to convince your voice that soft is not a compromise. I wish for my hands not to forget the way to do fisherman\u2019s rib when I\u2019m seventy and have a neighbor named Ernie who insists I join his bowling team even though he cannot count above seven. I wish for your mother to find the right way to be proud of you even if it does sound like an insurance brochure sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wishes have weight,\u201d I say, and feel that weight distribute itself across the room the way light does when it figures out how to use our lamps. \u201cMine is that the needle is only as magic as we need and no more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s godly restraint,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you ever start a religion, I will print the pamphlets.\u201d\n\nThere are more storms because this is a state where the sky does not care about your calendar. There are days I am too tired to be interesting and Rocket\u2019s needs save me by requiring that I leave an apartment I would otherwise haunt. There are mornings where a woman with grief in her face kneels at the dog park to press her cheek to the fur of three different creatures who will never know what they did for her and that is the correct arrangement. There are evenings I find myself sitting on the floor of my bathroom because Rocket decided it is a sanctuary and I am trying to meet him half an inch closer to wherever he came from. There are quiet in-betweens where the needle hums with the building and I hum with the day and neither of us has to prove anything to be believed.\n\nOne afternoon in late March, when the light decides to behave like it is related to a season we recognize, my father calls from his garage in a town where the river has already given up all pretense and shows up at the banks like a dog that knows the way home. He asks me how the dog is and I tell him the measurable things first because it helps him to know there are numbers: pounds, minutes, miles, kibble brands, the count of days without an incident he can categorize. Then I tell him that when Rocket sees a child running, he freezes and then looks at me, and my father makes a sound that might be approval, and I hear inside it the thud of a nail set into wood with exactly the right amount of force. He tells me about a cabinet he built that fits without needing a shim and about the way snow slid off the shop roof in one ornamental piece this morning and startled him enough that he swore in the good way. He asks me if I am walking, as if walking were something you can own or fail, and I say, \u201cTwice, sometimes three,\u201d and he says, \u201cGood,\u201d in the voice of a man who is trying to say I am proud of you without it doing anything stupid to his throat.\n\nAfter we hang up, Rocket comes and puts his head on my knee as if someone whispered his name across town. The scarf slides to my lap and the rose cap presses briefly against my skin, a small insistent reminder that stories don\u2019t always solve things, but sometimes they keep your hands busy while time does what time does. I press the needle into my palm and remember the lake. I tap my knuckles against the table just once because R. Linn told me to knock on wood when we got home and I didn\u2019t and superstition is silly and also a language we share when we don\u2019t know which one of us needs which spell. The hum of the building thickens as it always does at five p.m. when everyone with a job and a stove returns to their particular arrangements with heat and hunger. The city breathes. The room holds. Rocket sighs. I do not make a wish. I make dinner. We walk. We come back. We keep what we can from coming undone.",

The piled snow along Nicollet turns into strata, gray on gray like a cake no one asked for, and the gutters learn to whisper again. The air smells like old pennies and the memory of worms. Rocket\u2019s nose thinks it is a library and checks out every book. The scarf is sometimes too much and then not enough depending on which corner of the block we\u2019re in. I find the sweet spot where it keeps my voice near my skin. The rose cap rests against my throat and reminds me that the world makes objects on purpose and people make stories around them whether or not the objects agree. When we reach the footbridge, the pond below has become the sort of surface that lies without malice. A black dog with eyebrows like punctuation gallops past and leaves Rocket deeply concerned about a grammar problem he cannot solve. I tell him we are all adjusting to new forms and he sneezes, which I decide is agreement.\n\nThe call from Katy comes at eleven on a Tuesday, which is when buildings choose to break because the day has not yet had its coffee. \u201cWater main,\u201d she says without sugar and without permission. \u201cBasement is filling, upper runs are loud. We\u2019re getting them out before floats become facts. Can you come. If you can\u2019t, I love you anyway,\u201d she adds, because she has learned to ask without making it a test. I am already packing the bag I keep for emergencies I do not believe in: spare leash, high-value bribes, nitrile gloves because I have learned the value of pretending you can stay clean, two towels that smell like my laundry soap, and the needle, which I pocket without interrogation because there are times to practice rationality and there are times to let your hands be superstitious. June texts three words in the kind of caps that make her phone look like a cheerleader: ON MY WAY. There is no discussion about whether Rocket is coming. He watches me in the hallway while I tie my boots and decides that staying home is not the job he wants today. I clip his harness with a ceremony that calms both of us and we take the elevator down in a silence that has a plan.\n\nThe shelter is a body in distress when we arrive, breathing too fast and sweating from places designed to stay cool. Water makes its own decisions along the hallway, that pathetic inch that is enough to make a mess of bureaucracy. The chorus is pitched higher than usual, voices layered with lists and leaks and the complicated thunder of dogs who want both out and in. Katy is everywhere. She moves like the kind of person you look for in a fire drill. She has towels under her arms and a roll of contractor bags clenched in her teeth and she is smiling at someone on accident because her face refuses to surrender its kindness. \u201cGrab the top run,\u201d she says around the plastic, dialogue elegant despite the circumstances. \u201cCrates stacked, left side, two are bolted stupid and one latch is rusted, don\u2019t get bit, don\u2019t make promises we can\u2019t keep.\u201d She touches Rocket\u2019s shoulder in passing and says, \u201cGood job,\u201d to both of us, and keeps going without checking to see if anyone needed that to be true.\n\nJune appears with a milk crate full of towels that belonged to a yoga studio that clearly did not survive January. She has her hair up with the needle pinned through it, and for half a second I register the absurd elegance of a woman who can look like a saint in a flood. We slosh down the hall together while Rocket negotiates wet tile with dignity. I tell him we are in a church and he should remember his indoor voice. He flicks his eyes to me and then walks as if his paws know how to read the room. The first run is chaos organized into pairs. Crates like apartments, stacked two and then sometimes three high, each with a temporary name and a face that has opinions. The top left crate has a zip tie where a latch should be and the dog inside is a smooth tan river of panic named Juniper. Her eyes do orbit math between me and the flood and back. I say her name the way you say your own in a mirror when you want to know if it still belongs to you.\n\nThe tie has been over-tightened in the way ties are when men with confidence and women with fear meet a plastic solution. My pocket knife slides under it and stops where melted bright green loses to metal. June hands me a pair of diagonal cutters she produced from somewhere in her cardigan and the sound of the cut is obscene and beautiful. The door swings and I slow it with my hip and my whole life. Juniper presses forward and I insert my body as a clumsy anti-door. I rub the top of her head and pretend an arc of my palm is a spell. She hesitates exactly as long as my breath and then climbs into June\u2019s arms because there are some physics models I will never get credit for. June walks away with a tan river that has decided to become a dog for the next three minutes, and I turn to the next problem.\n\nTwo crates down a latch has rusted itself into philosophy. The slider is a line seized to a promise. The dog inside is a speckled cattle dog with opinions he has been asked to flatten for weeks and the water is advancing in a way that makes the situation impolite. Rocket watches from his place against the wall where I asked him to stay, his body spelling patience in cursive, and I put my fingers on the metal because the instinct is older than reason. The needle in my pocket makes its presence known by doing nothing and being ready. I slide the rose cap into my palm by feel and use the shaft to lever the slider toward sense. It bends its initial refusal into a question and then into cooperation the way people do when you refuse to make a scene. The cap\u2019s little petals dig into my skin enough to feel like they are listening. The latch gives, not like surrender, more like a compromise, and I allow myself the small pride that comes when tools and will align. The cattle dog blasts out and then stops when I say wait because he has been told that word in a hundred rooms and only once did someone mean it like a bridge. I clip a leash to his collar and hand him to Gus who has appeared beside me like a man conjured by a list. He grins in the way of people who still believe in endorphins. \u201cNice pick,\u201d he says, and I realize he means the needle and not the dog, and I pocket whatever that does to my face.\n\nWhen the second string of crates has been opened and their inhabitants transferred into towels and arms and temporary lives, Katy\u2019s voice carries down from the back hallway where the grooming station has become a staging area. \u201cWe need the scared ones first,\u201d she says, and people arranged for brunch and left instead move at her words like prayer. Rocket and I ferry. He is the person I did not plan to be and I am the dog he hoped I was. We carry an old beagle with a sagging belly like a beloved aunt. We carry a pair of bonded chihuahuas who scream like teakettles until the moment you laugh and then they notice they can breathe again. We carry a hound whose voice is the only thing about him that knows how to be big. June brings towels and hearts and a tone I have only heard once from her when she talked a coughing child through a panic at a co-op with no inhaler. The needle sits quiet in my pocket and warms my hip as if it were in on a joke that does not require a punchline.\n\nThere is a moment where it starts feeling like we could be finished and that is always when the world says, How sweet. A sound rises from the far washroom that is not bark and not water and not any machine a civilized person should own. It is the seizure of a pipe giving up and the insult of something falling where it shouldn\u2019t and the grief of a creature who has had enough. Katy\u2019s voice goes low enough to make everyone else taller. \u201cCheck the south arm,\u201d she says, and then to me specifically, \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone get heroic. We need them alive, not impressed with themselves.\u201d The south arm is a narrow hall with half-height runs designed for overflow and regret. The last gate is bent out of square and the dog inside is a lurcher with a scar like a sentence down his flank and a name that says everything: Lionel. He is not panicking properly. He is looking at the gate like it said something rude about his mother and rehearsing biting his way to freedom. I do not like his rehearsal. I tell Rocket to down with my hand and my certainty and he flattens with such dignity it feels like he invented the command. I squat sideways to reduce my height and my threat and talk to Lionel about everything but the problem until the problem is not the only thing in the room. I use the needle to coax the bent bar back into alignment because imagination is a tool of mine, and when metal decides to be temporarily forgiving in the hands of a woman whose patience has been exercised all winter, I do not ask whether magic was invited.\n\nWe move them out. We move them up. The rooms fill with bodies that smell like bleach and hope and winter and wet dog and we make new plans around them until the room agrees to be that plan for an hour. June is a machine designed for comfort and leverage. She takes Sprite\u2019s foster\u2019s little boy by the hand when he appears with his mother carrying a crate that has become too heavy for her description of herself that morning. She sends him for more towels with the kind of praise that could raise a building. Rocket lies among the chaos like an exclamation converted into a period. People step around him automatically, their bodies rearranging in the ancient choreography of not stepping on the good thing. Katy passes me a clipboard and a look that reserves actual gratitude for later when she is not in charge of a crisis. She says, \u201cI owe you a drink that has an umbrella in it even if we have to skewer the fruit ourselves,\u201d and then, because she refuses to pretend there is only one kind of relief, she adds, \u201cHe is a better man when you\u2019re around. The board would hate how I said that but the truth rarely asks permission.\u201d\n\nBy three, the building is less angry. The water is not a narrative anymore; it is a mess. People are soggy in places they didn\u2019t know could be soggy. Dogs have been distributed to temporary addresses and the sound inside is something you could live with. Gus brings pizza as if the only food that should be eaten on the day a floor floods is something that admits it wasn\u2019t built to last either. June sits on a crate turned on end and eats her slice hunched to keep oil off her cardigan. I stand with my back against a kennel door that smells like clorox and clothing that once belonged to nicer occasions. Rocket sits at my knee and watches cheese as if it has been elected. Katy gets a call and her face does the thing faces do when news is better than it has any right to be. \u201cPlumber did the word triage with a straight face,\u201d she says. \u201cWe might save the south arm without tearing out the world. Insurance heard the noise it likes. I am going to say a sentence that will make me sound like someone else: I believe in checks arriving,\u201d and then she laughs because she hates that as a personality trait. She gestures with her chin to Rocket. \u201cHe was steadier than half my volunteers,\u201d she says, and I resist the urge to tell her that steadiness is not a breed but a decision.\n\nWhen we get home, the apartment smells like the version of my day that didn\u2019t get its way. I strip in the entryway in a way that feels more like molting than propriety and throw everything into the washer because sometimes cleansing is ritual and I am not sophisticated enough to refuse it. Rocket falls asleep in a shape that is 60 percent dog and 40 percent puddle. June sits on the floor with her back against my couch and her hair falls out of its pins like a flag deciding to be less patriotic. She has the needle in her hand and she rolls it back and forth across the floorboards with that small clink that sounds like a practical prayer. \u201cWhen you used it on that latch,\u201d she says without looking up, \u201cit looked like the movies where the woman in the sensible shoes saves everyone with the tool the man thought was decorative,\u201d and I open my mouth to say it was just a lever and then I close it because modesty is sometimes just a label we stick on fear. She leans her head back to look at me upside down. \u201cI know you don\u2019t actually believe in talismans,\u201d she says. \u201cI know you pocket it for your hands. But I like that your body is letting your brain be less lonely.\u201d\n\nWe sleep hard that night, the kind of civilian sleep that follows a day of emergency adjacent to us but not about us. I dream about water meeting its borders and deciding to be kind and when I wake I don\u2019t chase it. The next day it snows six inches because the sky is petty. We go to the park anyway and Rocket discovers that the new layer restores winter\u2019s reputation and tries to bury his face in it until he is a white muzzle with a plan. On the way back we pass a flyer taped to a light pole with blue painter\u2019s tape, my favorite brand of public pain. LOST reads the headline, and beneath it the face of a gray cat whose expression suggests he will be a disappointment to whomever finds him. Rocket sniffs the base of the pole as if it has an opinion about cats and I say, \u201cNo cats,\u201d as if that is a law we both agree to follow. A man emerges from the corner bodega with a bag of ice as if he doesn\u2019t understand the concept of outside. He holds the door for me and Rocket like a person who has decided that courtesy is better than belief. He says, \u201cHe looks like the kind that listens,\u201d and I realize the stranger is complimenting me in a language that suits both of us.\n\nI tell myself this is how you live now: you go to work and you send emails and you walk your dog when the sky says no and you answer calls when pipes explode and your neighbor gives you hearts like currency and you stitch a small metal rose into a scarf and pretend not to notice that when your hand slides across it your whole body remembers heat. You go to Butter on days you cannot justify and you and June sit close and split a piece of cake whose frosting tastes like the memory of butter. You listen to June talk about the woman at Fixations who knits too tight because she is trying to hold in a life she has not admitted she is leaving, and you tell June that you once corrected a man\u2019s grammar in a client meeting and he began pronouncing your name like it was a cautionary tale and neither of you apologize for any of it. You make appointments for Rocket\u2019s teeth and your own and remember to bring a notebook to both because novelty makes you an unreliable narrator. This is the part of the story where an author would insert a single-sentence paragraph about contentment being a conspiracy, and this is where I write an entire one without that trick, because contentment is not a spasm but a practice, and I am not interested in clever interjections when the muscle we are training is endurance.\n\nThe first real test comes not with water or weather but with children, as most tests around here do. The twins\u2019 moms arrange a casual courtyard thing for those of us who brave a March that thinks it is January. Someone drags out the corn hole boards as if reminding the building of summer is a civic duty. Someone else brings a tray of brownies that taste like nostalgia even if you don\u2019t share the nostalgia. The twins are allowed to bring their scooters and they do immediately and with no regard for shin integrity. Rocket has met these small beings on leashes and thresholds, but never at speed, never with sugar in their blood and faces made of future. I keep him on a long line that has saved marriages and reputations and I make my voice a low steady thing we could both use as a coat rack. I say, \u201cWe are going to practice being boring,\u201d to him and then to myself, and he looks at me like he is willing to pretend this is what he wanted all along.\n\nThe first pass of Scooter A is fine. Rocket looks and looks away and receives from me a small fish that once swam in an ocean I have not seen. Scooter B comes with a noise like a violin being insulted and Rocket\u2019s ears do their impressive, meaningful pivot and then his eyes find my thigh and I pay him with a word and the promise that if he can handle this, he can handle anything short of fireworks. The twins\u2019 moms watch with an interest that is neither intrusive nor performative. Mrs. Barlow makes a face at me from her chair like she is measuring the room against a past room in a different building and I pass whatever that test is because she has the decency to look pleased. A man I know only as loud upper floor guy ceases to yell into his phone for one minute and says, \u201cThat\u2019s a handsome animal,\u201d and I say, \u201cHe likes it when people are predictable,\u201d and loud upper floor guy barks out a laugh and says, \u201cDon\u2019t we all,\u201d and goes back to offering unsolicited advice to whoever is too far away to avoid it.\n\nThere is a scare. There is always a scare, because otherwise we would mistake a day for a movie. One of the twins, a girl with a face designed to disarm juries, turns to avoid a plant on the beaten path and the scooter goes out from under her in a way that gravity takes personally. Her knees meet concrete and her palms take the rest of the argument and she makes a sound like a kettle beginning to understand itself. The courtyard holds a breath because we are a species who knows what blood looks like. Rocket stands to figure out what to do about the sound and I tell him nothing because I am a woman who has memorized the value of silence. He looks at me and then at the girl and then he lies down with his ribs pressed flat to the earth. The girl\u2019s mother arrives in two strides and scoops her child in one practiced conflation of fear and practice. The crying is enormous in the small space between buildings. You can feel it roll across brick and shrub and my face, which has learned not to qualify noise as inconvenient. Rocket makes the smallest sound in the back of his throat, the vocal equivalent of a hand you set just near a friend\u2019s elbow so they can take it if they want and pretend it was theirs if they don\u2019t. The child hiccups and looks at him and does a thing that will be labeled brave depending on who tells it later. She holds out a small hand with streaks and says, \u201cHi,\u201d as if introducing herself to a person who has just moved in on her block. Rocket stretches his neck, nothing else, and sniffs with the gravity due to any new data. Then he rests his chin back on the concrete and breathes.\n\nI have to remind myself to breathe too. June appears at my shoulder with a wipe and a bandage the size of an adult\u2019s boasts and kneels without fanfare because she is not yet done proving that competence is sexier than people admit. The mother cleans, the child negotiates, the courtyard puts its shoulders down, Rocket blinks like a man who has decided a thing and sticks with it. Later the twins\u2019 moms bring me a cup of something in a mason jar that does not quite taste like lemonade and is sweeter for it and says, \u201cIf anyone asks us about your dog we will tell them he is a religious experience and that you probably have cousins you don\u2019t mention,\u201d and I say, \u201cI will accept the first part.\u201d Mrs. Barlow stands when she should not, because she wants to make an exit into a gesture, and says, \u201cThere are two kinds of stories in buildings like this. Today you told the one where everyone ends up eating cake,\u201d and I nod because those are the only days I have energy to stay for.\n\nWork tries to be a villain the following week and fails because I have learned to give it the correct role. A client sends an email that pretends to be urgent about a brand voice that was never alive. I stand at my counter with Rocket on the floor looking up at me like I might drop ethics and I write back, \u201cWe can insist on optimism without telling lies,\u201d and then, because I am a woman who has learned to plate palatable truth, I add three bullet points and an action plan. My supervisor swings by my desk in the way a person does with a speech and says, \u201cWhatever is happening in your personal life, stay there,\u201d and I do not tell him that luck is not a place. I schedule Rocket\u2019s vet check for Tuesday afternoon and go out to Loring Park in the morning to tell the trees about it because they are better at listening than my first employer.\n\nIt rains. The rain is committed in a way I find admirable. Minneapolis in rain feels like someone mistook our skyline for a spit of land off the coast of somewhere else and decided to grant us a maritime arc. Rocket disapproves at first because every sound is new again and then decides beads of water on his face are just another variety of attention. We walk in our hoods like penitent saints. June joins us because she needs to badger me into attending a craft fair that promises to be ninety percent macrame and ten percent jam, and we admire the way the pond trades its ice for geese with no apology. The needle warms in my pocket the way metal does when you place it against a body under a jacket. I do not make it anything it is not and still, I like the weight.\n\nOn a Thursday afternoon when the city cannot decide if it is threatening a storm or a party, my mother arrives with a suitcase that has seen two vacations and a funeral. She has chosen a coat that reads as neutral in every photo and a pair of boots she will later say are \u201cfine,\u201d which is how she locates her disappointments on an appropriate map. She treats Rocket like a question mark that came with my education. She holds her hand out the way videos tell her and he approaches with the gravity due to a woman who taught me how to read without letting me throw away the books. He sniffs and then does the lean that is his acceptance of this arrangement, and my mother\u2019s face tightens in the way some faces do when softness enters without knocking. She puts her palm on his head and says, \u201cYou are warmer than I expected,\u201d and then, to me, \u201cYou are more yourself than you sounded on the phone,\u201d and I choose to accept both items as compliments because my father does not have a monopoly on restraint.\n\nWe take her to Butter because it is church and because the city looks better from a seat by a window with eggs under consideration. My mother watches June with the curiosity she brings to mid-range restaurants and flea market items she will later pretend not to have wanted. June resists the urge to perform and fails in small ways that look like generosity. They talk about yarn like it is a language my mother might pick up if encouraged. My mother tells an unflattering story about me at four and follows it with a flattering one from thirteen because she has learned how to deliver herself to other people in combinations that do not compromise her pride. She asks me whether the dog sleeps on my bed and when I say, \u201cSometimes,\u201d she nods like she has just successfully predicted my character. On the way back we run into the lab and his man, whose name has settled into Colin in my head like a fact, and my mother says, \u201cHe looks stable,\u201d and I realize she meant the man and not the dog and I laugh in a way that uses muscles I have not used around her.\n\nWe do not fight because neither of us requires that sport anymore and we do not perform intimacy because neither of us trusts the scoring. We do walk together around the block and admire the symmetry of people\u2019s small trees in their windows while Rocket sniffs the base of things and performs the role of my reason to be between conversations. My mother pauses at the flyer for the gray cat and says, \u201cYou should not adopt a cat,\u201d as if she has caught me in the act of considered betrayal, and I say, \u201cI barely adopted a dog,\u201d and she says, \u201cYou adopted the world the minute you learned to read,\u201d and we both pretend we have not said anything too large to put away neatly. When she leaves two days later she hugs June harder than makes sense for a woman she has known for a forty-eight hour period and tells me that if I get married I should call her before I call anyone else because she owns certain dresses and certain opinions and I say, \u201cThat\u2019s a safe bet,\u201d and she frowns because I am making a joke where she was making an offer and I am a person who does that.\n\nIn April the city writes notes to itself in crocus. The ground spits up things we did not remember burying. Rocket brings me a stick one morning with an earnestness that seems to expect applause and I realize we have slid into family without a speech. Katy texts me a photo of a dog named Lionel sleeping upside down on a foster\u2019s couch with his belly in the air and a man\u2019s feet in the frame in wool socks with a hole in the toe and I feel that warm loop that connects us in absurd ways. Gus stops us in the park to tell me he is seeing someone whose dog does agility and he believes in a future where he carries tiny foldable tunnels in his car, and I realize I am more interested in his hope than I have been in any stranger\u2019s biography in a long time. June finishes the scarf and gives it to me with a flourish that accidentally makes me cry, and I discover that my face can do that in a room where it does not need to apologize. The needle hums along with the building and the spring and the fact that we are all still practicing.\n\nOne night I wake because Rocket wakes because the world wakes, and there is a sound outside like glass being asked too much of. I sit up in a body that has learned the price of standing as an intervention and listen. Down the hall, someone moves with urgency, the kind that keeps its own counsel. In the alley, a man\u2019s voice could be yelling or laughing and we will know only when the second voice arrives. The building breathes out its old heated breath and in the gap between exhale and inhale I reach for the needle on the nightstand and put it in my palm. It is cool and then not and I think not of magic, not of Duluth, not of any woman whose grief was smarter than mine. I think of lever and latch and the way metal believes in physics even when people don\u2019t. I think of friction and warmth and the thumb imprint in the rose cap that is mine now and not. I breathe, and the building breathes, and the sound outside resolves into nothing that belongs to us. Rocket lays his head back down on his paws and does the small groan that means I will be patient with the fact that everything had its own plan. We sleep, not because the world lets us, but because we have trained ourselves to be greedy for rest.\n\nLater, when the first thunder comes, it does not undo any of the work. Rocket lifts his head and tests the noise against his new archive. He decides he does not have to fight the sky. I decide I will not interpret every sound as drama. We go out in the morning after and the air smells like every metal object in my grandmother\u2019s garage knew a storm was coming and stayed anyway. The scarf around my neck is still too much for three blocks and then perfect and then like memory. The rose cap ticks against my collarbone like a metronome only I can hear. June meets us with a bag of lemon muffins and a story about a customer at the co-op who cried in front of the apples because sometimes you just need a place to cry, and the four of us\u2014two women, one dog, and the city which is its own being\u2014stand and decide that whether or not anything is magic, we are making ourselves into people who keep things from coming undone, and that will have to be enough.",
