By the time the sky found its voice again, it had already burned itself hoarse. It was like listening through a wall to a choir rehearsing the same nautilus spiral of notes, higher and higher, until the sound peeled the paint, until the plaster cracked and let you see the lath beneath. When the men began to shine—first their eyes, then their skin, then all of them—people forgot how to breathe for a week. The old air was unfit for the new light.

We learned to carve the earth. We sunk into the clay and the bedrock with our pick-songs and end-of-the-world teeth. We burned train lines into the basalt and hung lamps made from firefly glass and the remnants of the old cathedral chandeliers. We kept the caverns cool with river-lung machines. We sang to stone to keep it sleeping. We taught ourselves to worship ceilings.

Not because they were beautiful. They were all we had.

The men changed first. I will say it plain: they became gorgeous in the worst way, as if beauty itself had discovered a new marrow and rushed there to live. Their bones turned to lattice, their blood learned to catch light and keep it, and they began to float just barely when they were joyful, or angry, or simply filled with bread. They didn't die in the old way, though they still could be hurt. They could touch you, but you'd come away with the taste of baking metal on your tongue. They gave off warmth, and then heat, and then some of them could not help but pour radiation into the rooms we shared. They would cry about it. They would weep and scorch the furniture with their tears. A few lives and most of the surface were ruined before we understood that we must give them their own chambers, that we must give them hymns to sleep under and corridors to walk where the walls had been salted to resist burning.

"Chief?" Tamsin said, her voice like a paper cut. That thin and that precise. "You should see this. Already chalked off the section."

My boots hissed on the catwalk's mesh. Sumpwater lifted its sour smell, and the low hum of the drains was tonight’s prayer. It was the sort of night the stone sweats, and it makes the mold all slick with tenderness. My hands itched. I was tired and thinking about cardamom buns, which was a problem. When the city rewards you with cravings, you've stayed too long awake.

"I'm seeing it," I said, pushing under the dangling chain of an old chandelier someone had turned into a ward. Our residents are pin-junkies when it comes to charms. Salt sachets, feather charms. They stick rusted cutlery to their door lintels to spoil the taste of spirits. The chain clinked like a laugh.

Tamsin led me around a barricade of ventilator crates to where the chalk lines glimmered. They had used the good chalk, the pale blue that glows under seraph light and marks skin like a bruise. The body lay in the wake of a char wave, the soot flung thinly and evenly. A pattern like a fan.

"Another halo flare," said Kyo, from the shadows beyond the chalk. He was leaning on the wall as if it might at any moment jump. Kyo always leaned like that. He should have been born as a hinge.

"Looks like it," I said, though I didn't agree. The wall above the body told a different story: thin streaks of incandescent slough, not the neat circle of a halo burst. It was messy. It looked like someone had dragged a corona along stone.

The body itself was not a man. Not this time. A woman, mid-forties, a seamstress by the tags sewn into her collar. Her hands were still, palms open, as if she'd tried to hold whatever was coming, as if it had been beautiful. On the wall just above the left shoulder, the smeared fire had left a pattern the old languages would have called a letter. Our own letters don't like to curl that way. This one did, a delicate hook, like an ear or a question.

"It doesn't look like a natural flare," Tamsin said, echoing without permission. She is good at that. It's why she's tolerated. That and the fact that she can run in the tight corridors without chipping her molars on her tongue.

"It looks like someone masked it as one," I said and squatted to smell the air above the body. Ozone, yes. Bitter resin, yes. Warm metal, yes, and something that made my jaw ache like biting ice. Citrus. That caught me. The transformed sometimes trail scents, almost always the clean ones. Cedar, honey, the very first hour of baking bread. Citrus is rare here; it's a memory.

I closed my eyes and remembered my stepfather holding a peeled orange under my nose on some early morning when the city was young and my mother had think-bags under her eyes from staying up to listen to the new men cry. He would make a smile of the peel and set it on my face. He’d say, "For the future," and he'd sound as if he had seen it and it had not destroyed him. Jonas Vale had the gift of not being broken by foresight.

"Who found her?" I asked, opening my eyes.

"A runner from Choir House," Tamsin said. She pointed to the end of the corridor. It was heavy with lichen and steam valves, a dim mouth. "He said the light went wrong. He said someone was singing in the wrong key."

Kyo pushed off the wall. "You should see the valves two turns east of here. The stone's skin is bubbled. Like an ill child with scarlet fever."

"Maybe it was just a badly kept seraph. Maybe he couldn't regulate." Tamsin pulled a sour face at the word. Some people hate it, the word. Too proud. Too dramatic. I like it. It's not as pretty as what happened. It's not as ugly either. It is a bridge across silence. "Or maybe," she said, wanting me to be sharp, "someone walked him down here like a dog and pulled his halo like a leash until he burned where they told him."

We little like to talk about the leashes. The ash-knots. The harnesses. We invented them and we despise ourselves for it, in the same way that a mother despises herself for telling her child no. They are necessary and they are cruel. They are the only thing that lets us share corridors and markets and pews with men who might unmake us for love.

"Hold the scene," I said and stood up. "Kyo, go check those valves. If they're bubbled, we have to call a heatdrain crew before the night bends. Tamsin, run Ward Three’s roster and flag all undocumented men. Anyone without a minder. Get me the Choir House duty sheets for tonight. Who's on? Who escaped? Who flared. Find the runner. We need his ears."

"Yes, Chief," Tamsin said. She was already talking into her throat mic by the time I had finished the sentence. Precise.

"When you're done," I added, "bring me water. And something sweet. Nothing from the gongs."

"Cardamom?" she asked, so I knew she had read my face and I wasn't as opaque as I wanted to be.

"Don't be clever," I said. "Be quick."

"Being quick is being clever," she said and fled, long legs, high hair. She should not have been a cop; she should have been a dancer. We had no dancers left. All the old jobs had to rent themselves new names.

Kyo waited until she had gone to say, "You smell like rain, Mara."

"I don't remember the smell of rain," I said. "Not really. The vents bring it back sometimes, with the mud scent, but it's wrong. It hits the wrong panel in my head. Why are you telling me that?"

"Because you have your storm face," said Kyo. "And because the runner wasn't lying. The singing was wrong. I thought it was a joke the first time I heard them say such things. 'He sang wrong and the ceiling cracked.' 'He hummed carelessly and we lost half a staircase.' But I hear it now. There’s a key that keeps the stone asleep. And some of the men don't keep it. Because they can't. Or because they won't."

"You think it's the second," I said.

"No," Kyo said, rubbing his thumb across the callus at the base of his index finger. That old soldier’s comfort. "I think someone told him not to."

"Someone told him to sing a wrong note," I said. "Here. On purpose."

"You will make your mouth full of the Chancellor's name after that thought," said Kyo, and did not smile with his mouth, but the edges of his eyes laughed in the deep way.

"Don't," I said. "Not here."

He inclined his head. He had been the sort of soldier who will never stop seeing doorways as mouths, waiting to bite him. He could count the number of breaths it took to die in airless spaces. He could lift a child with one hand and make it feel like flying. He kept the count of men who had burned without anyone to hold their hands, and it ate his sleep.

"And you," he said softly, "will make your mouth full of Jonas's name. Not here. All the same."

"Go see the valves," I said. "Report back. Be careful. If the stone blisters near a vein, you'll hear the river. That means we're too close."

"You smell like rain," he said again, stubborn as a nail, and went.

I crouched by the chalk again and stared at the woman. I put my hand on the ground near her cheek and listened through the floor. There is a pitch to sorrow you can hear through stone. It travels the bones of the city and inks itself on the teeth. It rang me like a bell, and the bell then wrote my name very small and said: not yet. Not yet, Mara Vale. You do not get to cry here.

"Jonas," I said, and the word came out like a splinter.

My stepfather ran Choir House for Ward Three. He had been a mason before the Searing. He had the hands to prove it: squared and abraded. He could set stone with patience and certainty; he knew it was souls he held after. The men came to him because he was unafraid to sit next to them while their breath made waves, because he smiled at a thing without sentimentality, because he had a habit of washing his hands before he touched any sacred, and men like him always keep their rituals. He would press their palms and say, "It's on me. Sing when you want to." Which was the same as telling them they were not owned.

My mother loved him with a winter's love—careful, wanting fire when there was fire, wanting more blankets when there were no more blankets. He loved her back with a mason's love: slow, precise, unmoving. It looked like nothing until the wall stood without the buttress and even the breeze did not shift it.

The night he married my mother, he waited until the end of the feast to pack the leftovers, and gave them to a boy who'd been too shy to join the line. He didn't notice Kyo watching him. He didn’t notice me watching Kyo watching him. He didn't notice the Chancellor’s envoys watching all of us, ink-black coats, soft boots, taking our measure to see how much love we'd be willing to sell.

I wasn't thinking about any of that when I went to Choir House. I was thinking about a woman with burner-smear on her walls and an ear-shaped letter singed into old stone. I was thinking about what citrus means, down here—how once my mother had paid one month's tobacco ration for two lemons and made a pie I still dream about, a pie nobody else in the block could afford, and she fed slices to people who pretended the crust did not make their eyes water from the luxury. I was thinking, too, about the letter in the breast pocket of my black jacket. Heavy paper, formal seal. The sort of seal that tries to make your hand flatter than itself when you unfold it. I hadn't opened it yet. I had kissed the wax in the dark and I had not opened it. I knew what it would say. We often do, about the letters we hate most.

"Chief Vale," the doorman said. He was a boy they've set to watch the vestibule, numbers burned into his arm to keep our registry. "They're in the quieting room. You can't go."

"I can," I said.

"They're singing," he said miserably. "Their halos are up. The guards told me to turn away anyone."

"I won't turn," I said.

He looked at my badge. My badge looked back, hard. He got out of my way without forgiving himself for it.

Choir House smelled like warm coins. The stairs were made of iron, which was wise, with mats to keep anyone from slipping in their awe. On the walls they had hung photographs of the men before and after. The befores were dim. The afters were too bright: the photographers had to wear smoked glass like the old solar techs. In three of them the halos had flared too suddenly and burned the paper wrong. The faces tore away into white. A different kind of mercy.

The quieting room was a bowl. They built it like that for acoustic reasons, but also because in bowls we are comforted. The men hummed like a hive. The sound lifted my hair. The guards posted at the doors were not from my precinct. They belonged to Chancellor Dareth's personal security—a detail borrowed like a shovel. The taller guard took up space as if he were a wall that had learned how to walk. The shorter one had eyes the yellow of broth. He kept biting the inside of his cheek.

"I need Jonas," I said.

"He's keeping their pitch," the tall one said.

"I need Jonas," I repeated. "You can keep your pitch for the time it takes him to step out."

"Orders keep the doors closed," the little one recited. "Orders say, 'If anyone comes, anyone at all, you say no and you keep saying no.'"

"Not to me," I said.

They looked at each other. These men looked at each other often, as if the act of seeing can make a decision softer. They were good, as guards go. They were still just knees and elbows in nice cloth.

The tall one said, "Madam Chief, we truly cannot—"

"It's Chief Vale," Jonas said, opening the door and letting a wedge of sound occur. He was smiling his gentle murderer smile. He was killing their fear and beating it into a chair where it had to sit, after all, after all. He had always been good at that. The men behind him looked at me as if they had discovered a cup of water. Then they shook off the stare, because they'd been taught to be hospitable.

"Come, Mara," Jonas said. "They're steady now."

I went to him because I could not not go. He kissed my forehead. I inhaled the odor of lemon on his skin and felt my knees think about melting.

"You smell like the old market," I said.

"Someone smuggled mandarins in Ward Eight," he said. "They paid me to look the other way and I told them I'd do it, only if they shared. I eat by my ethics." He grinned. "Why are your hands cold?"

"Because someone sang outside the lines in Ward Three," I said. "Because someone burned a woman. Because there was a mark with it. Like an ear."

"No one who belongs to this house left their bindings before the bells. Not with my blessing."

"Perhaps with someone else's," I said.

He opened his mouth and closed it. I didn't want to see that kind of silence in him. It meant he had already written the answer and was choosing not to show me the page.

"Who are they?" I asked, and saw him see my jacket. He saw the bulge of the letter I had not opened. He was no fool. He had been a mason; he set stone by reading the future of walls in the present of water.

"Don't," I said. "Don't—"

"Mara," he said, and my name in his mouth was a thing put in my hair when I was seven, a hairpin with a blue stone, cheap and dearly bought.

I touched his sleeve. Jonas's sleeves are not sacred. They are working sleeves. Some men down here wear their holiness like a new coat, but he wore it like a stain he'd decided to live with.

"Someone is pulling voices like wires," I said quietly. "They're wrapping songs around throats and leading them to soft places. This was not an ungoverned flare. It was an act. Tell me names."

He looked at the guards. The tall one looked down. The small one worried his cheek again, as if he could chew a hole into conscience and spit it out.

"I'll bring you a man tomorrow," he said. "Now I need to keep the room from boiling. This group has three new ones. One boy hasn't eaten today. They're like kettles. They're dangerous, yes, yes, but only because we love them. Go home. Sleep, if you can. Or go to your mother. She needs you more than I do tonight. She cries when the wind under the doors smells of ash."

"I don't go home until I know what the Chancellor's letters say," I said, and saw the twitch at his eye. The corner one. The tick that told me his temper had stood up in its chair but was not yet crossing the room.

"We don't need the Chancellor," he said.

"The Chancellor thinks he needs us," I said. "And he likes to be right about his needs."

"You should open it," he said. His voice went low. "Better to know the shape of the rock before it falls."

"No," I said, hating how small it sounded. "When it falls, it will fall either way. My knowing won't speed it or stop it."

"But your knowing will let you put out your hands," he said. "So you don't get broken the same way."

He turned his head. The halos behind him flickered, a storm of moths. He went back into the room. He closed the door with his careful, unbreakable hand. The guards looked at me and did the small bow men give to women whose patience they value but do not intend to serve.

I opened the letter on the stair.

The seal broke like sugar. The Chancellor writes with the sort of ink that will not blur even when the paper sweats; he buys his inks from a shop that remembers the names of rivers. His words body forth like men, with shoulders and the good waist. He does not believe in metaphors when he can threaten directly.

Chief Mara Vale, it said.

For the safety of Ward Three and to preserve order, you are required to remove Jonas Vale, keeper, from his position, and to prevent his attendance at the Convocation of Tithes. You will execute this order by any means necessary before the twelfth bell tomorrow, without public notice, without bodily remains. Jonas Vale is to be considered compromised in loyalty. This directive has been authorized by my hand.

Under it, the black bruise of his sign, with the ring edges cutting the paper. He has never had the sort of hands that would be allowed to lay stones. He has a different arrangement of bones.

They had the grace to recall the word "remove" before the word "execute." They had the cleverness to write "without bodily remains." They had the audacity to assume I could do it. To assume I would. I put the letter back into my breast pocket and almost laughed.

"Compromised," I said to the empty stair. The stair shook a little. The quieting room held its pitch; nobody boiled. I pressed my lips together. I could hear my mother. I could hear her scrub pot, the way the cloth rings the same way whether you are washing medicine or grief. She had taught me what it means to clean something you can't make clean. She knew and she did not stop.

On the landing, a woman sat with her hands wrapped around her knees. She had the look of a person who had chosen a small surface to sit on because any bigger surface would be a boat, and she would have to choose which water to sail. She saw my badge. She didn't flinch. She wore a brown scarf at her throat, unraveling, and had put lemon peel in her pocket. I could smell it even from two steps down.

"You lost someone," I said, and hated the cheapness of it. Everyone down here has lost someone. What else do you say to the sea.

"It's only a hat," she said, surprising me. She lifted a felt thing with a bad brim. In it someone had stitched a gold thread. "He wore it when he still had a head that didn't frighten the mirrors. He said he'd keep wearing it even when his hair burned off and his skull lit from inside. I laugh. I don't want to laugh. He looks better without it. He's so beautiful now, I have to look away to keep from worshipping him. Is that wrong?"

"No," I said, my voice not my voice. "No."

"I always wanted a god," she said. "Now my husband is one. It's confusing. It makes the sauces taste wrong. I forget how much salt to put in soup. Do you go to them?" She nodded at the door. "Do you worship yours?"

"I keep the dust off their steps," I said. "I don't know if that counts."

"You look like the step that someone left their foot on," she said, and then clapped a hand to her mouth because she had not meant to say it aloud. Her eyes filled. "I'm sorry. I meant—"

"It's fine," I said. "You can say mean things. Mean and true often braid together. They can carry a pail better that way."

She swallowed. She picked up the hat. "You'll do the right thing," she said suddenly, fiercely, as if she had changed her mind about me. "I can tell. Some people you can tell. You're not wrong in your bones."

I tried to smile at her. I think I might have bared my teeth.

"You don't know what the right thing is," I said. "Neither do I."

She wiped her eyes with the back of her wrist, looked at the hat as if it might tell her how to hold it now. She walked away without saying goodbye. She smelled like lemon and ash.

When I walked back towards the precinct, the ceiling above the long corridor of the old archery range was painted with stars. Children had chalked them white and blue and some had thrown in green for foolishness. Someone had drawn a comet and no one had scolded them for bringing a fall into a sky that cannot afford another. A smaller hand had written a word underneath the spray of chalk: remember.

"I do," I said. "I do. I do."

The door to my mother's apartment stuck as it always did. She yelled, "You didn't oil it," as I shoved in. I liked that constancy. If the door had yielded, I would have thought there had been a bad change. The lamp threw a honey light. She had wrapped her hair in a rag while she scrubbed. On the table, a cup of mint tea sweated. Jonas's mug was there, too. It had a chipped rim and a blue willow pattern that lost its trees sometime last year. He had left it sweating.

"He's at the House," I said.

"I know where he keeps his steps," she said. She scrubbed. She might have scrubbed the word compromised off her knuckles if she could. She had no idea that that word would come for her sooner than her tea would cool, and she had every idea. She is that kind of woman. "You haven't eaten. Your jaw goes crooked when you don't eat."

"I had a bun," I said. "Cardamom."

"Those are for saints," she said, and smacked my hand when I went to pinch a bit of the bread she'd left warm on the table. "Sit. Tell me why your eyes look like nails have met them."

"Who said that?" I asked, amused despite myself. "Who taught you that?"

"I've been listening to Kyo, because he tells stories like a glass cutter. It makes me nervous and happy. Did you get the letter from our friend? The one who keeps rods instead of ribs?"

I could have lied to her. Once, when I was ten, I tried. I told her I had not broken a mug. She looked at the shards and then at me and said, "If you ever lie to me about a thing that can injure our feet, I'll make you walk barefoot for a year until you love the truth like water." I told the truth. I still have the habit.

I put the letter on the table. She didn't touch it. She didn't have to. She read its shape. She read the way the seal broke. She read me.

"No," she said.

"Yes," I said.

"No," she said again. Then softer: "Oh, my sweet child, you do not have to."

"I do," I said. "He can make me do it by making it when and where. He can make me do it by choosing a place that will kill more if I refuse. He can make me do it by putting it in someone else's hand if not mine, someone who doesn't understand where to stand while it happens so that more falls than should. He wants it without remains, in silence. He wants it in the seam. I know how to do seams. You raised me. Jonas raised me. He taught me how to cut a body from a knot without untying the whole rope. He taught me how to take out a rotten stone and leave the wall standing. He taught me the words for love I could put in my mouth when I had to put a knife in my pocket. He is the man who can be killed by my hand without killing myself. He is honorable. He will know why. He will allow me to. And I will hate him for that permission for as long as the stone will hear my name."

"You will not talk about him like a sacrifice someone else is owed," she said. Her voice broke and shored itself up. "He is mine. He is yours. He is his. He is not the Chancellor's. I will go find Dareth and spit in the place where his throat joins his chest."

"You will not," I said, and smiled, and then did not. "Mother. Listen. Listen with the part that isn't just rage. I can go to Jonas and we can make a door. We can show me walking through it. We can close it. That's better than letting someone else blow the ceiling to make a hole."

"You talk like a carpenter when you're scared," she said.

"I talk like a carpenter," I said, "when there is work."

She put both hands flat on the table. She has two lines on the back of her left hand that look like gulls. I watched them dive and rise as her blood worked.

"Your father," she said.

"I don't remember him," I said.

"I know," she said. "He was gone before you grew language. He was not strong enough, in the new light. It isn't his fault. Jonas was strong enough. He held you when you had night terrors. He took your burnt blankets to the water and scrubbed them and did not tell you they were ruined. He is not a wrapped stone. He is the cornerstone. He will not come loose if we leave him. Do not—"

"Do not," I said and wanted to die. "Do not."

We sat together and tried to teach bread to hold our grief. We failed. There is no bread large enough for that. We used our teeth. It didn't help, much.

When Kyo came, he didn't knock. He stopped just inside the door and closed his eyes in the way of bringing a bad bird to roost somewhere inside his ribcage. He said, "The valves are blisters. There's an intersection cracked. Someone sang wrong on purpose. They opened a vein. It's not gushing yet, but the stone will cough. If we don’t put a keep-song there before daylight—" He saw my mother's face. He shut his mouth.

"It happens it says Jonas," I said.

He did not ask if I would do it. He closed his eyes again. He said, "We have ash."

"From the old factories," my mother said. "The black ash?"

"No," Kyo said. "From the churches. The old ash. The ash that knows names. If you smear it on your hands, the light hesitates. It is not kind. It is a trick. It is the sort of trick a priest would teach you when he has decided God is not looking for a moment. It makes everyone ugly for a while. Do you want some?"

"Yes," I said.

"No," my mother said.

"Tonight," Kyo said. "When he goes to mark the new ones with oil, he won't ask why there's ash. He will think you are simply keeping your palms until he is finished. He won't want to shame the new men by delaying their blessing. He'll let you stand near. I shouldn't be saying these things. This is poison. It tastes like iron."

"You are saving more doors," I said.

"Don't justify me," he said sharply. "Let me be a thief. Let me be a hinge. Let me be ugly in peace. Don't make me a hero. I cannot carry that weight and the other at once."

My mother left the room. I heard her in the bedroom. I heard her lift the lid of the old chest. I heard her take the things she had put away for a day she had prayed never to see. I smelled camphor. I smelled lemon. I smelled the wool cloak embroidered in a pattern of secret ivy she had not had the time to finish. She brought me the cloak. She tied it for me, the way she used to tie my school scarf, as if I were, for a moment, her little for when I was little.

"Bring me back his voice," she said. "I don't care about the rest. I want his voice. I want to hear it in the room, still. The rest can go to the river and get washed and that's God's business. His voice stays. Bring it back."

"I will," I said, and had no idea how such a thing could happen. What do we keep of each other? Is it the notes? Is it the air?

She pinched my cheek and then slapped it lightly the way her grandmother used to do to make the blood come up. She was someone else's granddaughter once, sunlight, wine. She kissed my mouth and went to wash a pot that was already clean.

Kyo had the ash in a little jar. The glass was old and pebbly. He had tied a string around its neck. The ash moved like a thought. He put it in my hand. It was cold and warmer than I wanted it to be all at once.

"When you touch him," he said, "he will know. Because he is not a stupid man. He will know. He will decide in that moment if he fights you. He won't. He will hold your wrist to make sure you do it clean. He will ask you to tell your mother a joke. He will tell you to breathe. He will stand. He will be heavy, and then light. The room will smell like Sunday. You will not like Sundays after that for a while. They will smell like murder."

"You've done this before," I said. I didn't make it a question. He had used this jar for something else. There was a memory in it, the way there is salt in a cook's cotton apron that will never wash out. I wasn't going to ask him who.

"No," he said, and then, because my face asked him not to lie where the floor might slip, he said, "Yes. Once. Twice. Each time the man knew why. He forgave me without being asked. That was worse. Forgiveness always is."

We walked out together, Kyo and I. My mother didn't come. She didn't watch us leave. She had decided to be either a thing turned entirely to stone or entirely to water. I didn't know which. They look the same at the beginning.

The city had settled into a slow hum. The market stalls had folded their skins. The night wards' bells swung from their ropes. Children pretended to be asleep in their nests. Men sang to their own hands, in case their own hands had learned a new language and needed a translator. The vents breathed. The ceiling above the archery corridor starlit itself chalk-white and wished us luck.

At the corner before Choir House, a boy ran past, holding something that glowed. He disappeared into an older corridor, laughter like the clink of beads. We could not stop being human. That's our daggers and our salvation all at once.

"Do you want me there?" Kyo asked.

"No," I said. "Yes. No."

"Pick one," he said gently.

"Be in the hall," I said. "If the wall tears, we brace it. If the singing breaks, we hold it. I don't want anyone else to see."

"Chancellor Dareth already sees," Kyo said, and put his hand on my shoulder. His hand was very warm. It frightened me, how warm a human palm can be when you suddenly fear never to touch one again.

"He sees badly," I said. "That's different."

We stopped outside the door. The guards were the same. The taller one had grown wary. The small one had bitten the inside of his cheek until there was a bit of blood at the crease of his lip. He looked at the jar. He looked at the way I had tied my cloak. He looked at my eyes.

"Let me in," I said.

"We will," said the tall one. "But. Chief. Out of respect. Do not let him fall."

"I won't," I lied.

Kyo took the jar from me and loosened the string. He held it out. The ash welcomed my fingers like water holds a hand that drowns and doesn't know how to stop. I pressed my palms together. I did not pray. My mouth thought about lemon. My jaw ached. I inhaled a whole memory of rain that I do not actually recall.

"Mara," said Kyo. He was going to say something I couldn't bear. He knew it. He stopped.

I opened the door to the quieting room. The bowl held its sound. Jonas looked up, because Jonas always knows when I enter a room. His halo, when he let it rise, was the gentlest thing you have seen, like the gold inside a coin that is not for spending, only kept to make the coin honest. He smiled at me and made a little flick of his fingers. It meant: wait.

I waited. He anointed three men, oil on his thumb, the old way, with a murmured word I could not hear, the way you do not hear your own name when you are drinking. He didn't look at me again. He finished the third. He set the little dish aside. He closed his eyes and drew a breath like a bellows taking in the fire.

Then Jonas Vale opened his eyes and looked at me as if the rest of the room had gone down a side tunnel and would be back after lunch.

He lifted his hand, and I went forward, and the ash, between us, slept and waited to wake.Jonas's palm hovered above mine, not touching yet, and the bowl-room's hum settled deeper, as if it had decided to become a floor we could trust for one more minute. The men had their halos dimmed low, obedient to the pitch he had placed beneath their ribs, and that gentler gold washed everything into a honeyed dusk. Oil glinted in the little dish like a tame sun. The ash between my hands woke as breath leaked through the seam of my fingers, and I felt it taste my skin in the way of a cat deciding who belongs to it and for how long.

"You have soot from saints," he said quietly, so as not to bruise the pitch he had shaped. He was smiling the way men smile when they have decided to lay down a weight and hope their hands will still know other labors after. His eyes were tired and unafraid, and there was a new lemon note in the air that was not from the Ward Eight mandarins and not from memory; it was a clean that arrived when a choice stepped into a room and sat in a chair, finally, finally. "Who told you to bring that to my door?"

"Kyo," I said, and hated the way my voice found the old hallway where it hid when I was thirteen and had lied about stealing a string of beads. I tilted my hands and let him see the ash without hiding it, because if I lied now my mouth would forget how to open for food. "He said it would make the light hesitate. He said you would know why. He said you would decide to forgive me and that would make it worse."

"It does," Jonas said, and the humor that came with it made me want to slap him and kiss the back of his hand in the same breath. He looked at the guards over my shoulder, and the tall one looked down as if his boots had become new to him just then. He looked at the men, and the men kept the note for him like a table holds a bowl, steady, uncomplaining, already bearing the next grief. "You opened it, then," he added, and his gaze flicked to the place on my chest where the Chancellor’s letter lay like a stone that wanted to pretend it was a bird. "You didn't make me speak it to you. That's kinder, and I didn't deserve that gift, but I take it."

"I didn't open it until I could hear you keeping a room," I said, because even now I am weak enough to want to bring witnesses into my excuses. The oil shivered when his shadow moved across it, and the scent of thyme rose up with something like patience hidden in its stem. "It asks me to remove you. It tells me to keep your body from doors and mouths. It uses words like order and safety in the way a thief uses gloves."

"Order is the glove they wear to touch us without leaving prints," he said, gently contemptuous, always able to build a sentence that could hold a man. He turned his wrist and the thin brightness at his pulse lifted and set down again, obedient. "Well, then. There are ways we can make their lie true without letting it be the only truth. We'll keep something. Your mother asked for my voice, didn't she?"

"She asked for your voice and didn't care about the rest," I said, and my throat went raw because my mother had put her mouth on mine and told me to come back with sound cupped like water. The ash heard my fear and made a small crackle, a congratulation for telling it the truth. "She has a wild idea about what can be kept and I have a worse one. Tell me if I am foolish."

"You are, as ever, foolish like a mason," he said, approving what he should have scolded. He glanced at the ceiling and then, in a gesture that was a habit and not a prayer, he rubbed his thumb against the calluses of his other palm as if telling his hands that they still belonged to him. "This bowl keeps pitch better than the ones in Wards One and Nine. The first time I heard its echo, I understood the way a sum understands a ledger. There's stone in this curve that remembers. We can set my voice there. We'll cheat, the way people who love do. You'll need a cord, though. Something to tie a throat to a room long enough for it to bruise the stone."

"Kyo is in the corridor, half made of hinge and the rest of him theft," I said, and held his gaze because it helped me stand. The guards shifted the way trees do when wind remembers them in the middle of a story. "He brought the ash. He will have string, because men who have been soldiers do not go anywhere without the means to make and unmake knots. The rest I don't know. I will do as you tell me, unless you ask me to be kind to you, and then I will fail."

He laughed, and it was not loud, but it held a dozen glasses lifting at once. He reached, slow as a good storm, and laid his hand on my wrist. His fingers were warmer than the light around him, and the light leaned away from my ash as if embarrassed to be seen at close quarters. "I do not ask you to be kind," he said, and the not-kind in him was love that had learned grammar. "I ask you to be exact. Put the ash on your hands and on the back of mine. Put a stripe under my jaw where the skin thins and the sound goes loudest when I sing stupid songs to boys who won't sleep. Don't touch my eyes, because if you do I'll blink and you'll lose the first measure. When it comes, it will be fast and you'll think you have three breaths and you really will have two. On the second breath, say my name the way you said it when you were seven and I lifted you to see the paper boats catch fire in the river sluices. The tone matters more than the word."

Kyo stepped into the doorframe like a shadow that had learned courtesy. He didn't cross the threshold because he knows bowl rooms don't like strangers unless they are wearing two promises and a third they intend to keep later. He held up a length of cooper's thread, thin and strong, smelling of pitch and old wine. The tall guard reached without asking and looped it over his fingers as if his hands had been waiting all day to be useful to something that wasn't cruelty. The small guard wiped blood from his lip and nodded once, a man deciding to live after all, after all.

"There's a lip in the floor," Jonas said to me, and I saw then the channel carved so finely along the edge of the bowl that it looked like a wrinkle or an idea. He moved his foot to show me how a single step could herd sound towards that cut, where it would run like water to the vein beneath and then come back kinder, carrying a thin sweetness it had stolen from the underworld and returned clean. "When the voice comes out of me, let it strike there. The thread goes from my throat to your hand and down to that lip. Hold it. Don't think of it as a noose or an umbilical or a leash. Think of it as a plum line between two certainties."

My mouth wanted to ask questions because my mouth is like a child in a market, reaching for sugared things that will rot its teeth. I wove the ash into my palms instead, the dust taking a shine the way a good knife takes an edge. It stuck to the lines between the bones as if recognizing its own dead. Oil on my thumb made a paste like the grit masons use to set the first brick of a stubborn wall, and I daubed Jonas under the jaw, right over the hollow where he had kissed my forehead hours ago and where the skin was thin and glad to be remarked upon. He closed his eyes, not as a saint and not as a coward, but as a man making a door in himself so that the people he loved could step through and not bruise their knees on the splinters.

"You'll make a joke for my mother," I said, because he had told me he would, and because I wanted the joke to exist in the room as a promise and not as a memory. I tied the thread around my wrist and looped it just once beneath the smudge of ash under his jaw. The length between us hummed, whether from nerves or from the halo reaching for a new shape I could not tell, and it didn't matter.

"The Chancellor's coat buttons are carved from jet," he said, and even now he was teaching with his slyness. He tilted his chin to give me the place I needed, generous to the very last inch. "If you hold one up to the light you can see the ghost of the fern that lived long before his lies did. If I wanted to murder him, I would steal his buttons and make him run around with his chest bare. That would kill him faster than knives."

It made me snort, the undignified sound of a girl trying not to cry and failing at both tasks. I took the breath he told me I would not notice and then the second he said I would have, and on that second I said, "Jonas," like I had when I was small and desperate, with the rain in the pipes making a sound that could have been horses or could have been doom. The stone caught me. The thread went taut. His light climbed.

There are dozens of ways a man blooms, and twice that for how he burns. Jonas did neither like anyone I had seen before, and I had seen men go from winter to summer in a mouth's span. His halo rose not like fire but like a choir standing, first the back row and then the front, each voice on its feet in an order that felt like water finding the sea. The warmth did not slap, as some flares do; it stroked the bowl-room until the steel of the stairs hummed a sympathetic little moan. He inhaled and the oil under my thumb flared with scent, thyme and lemon and that particular sweetness you smell when the surface of a crème brulée breaks and you don't yet know if the custard is set. I pressed my hands, ash against ash, palm to the back of his hand, and the light hesitated exactly where Kyo had promised it would, confused the way a river is confused when someone builds a clever gate and asks it to be patient.

"South," he said, and there was no time and there was all the time, because this is what a bowl does to a room when a man sings his last. His eyes were open and not seeing me and seeing me only, because death is greedy and particular. "If you see that letter again, the ear with the hook, it means south. It means the song is aimed at the old train tunnels below the lime kilns. It means someone wants to wake the stone where it remembers being seashell and give it back its ocean. It means they think collapse is a cradle."

"I know," I lied, and then I knew, because his breath left his mouth and I felt the word sail down the thread and ring the lip of the bowl with a note I had never been allowed to hear before. I pulled the thread like I was putting a line on a kite and the room took the sound and took the heat and took the body of light he had been making and made of them a fruit we could keep. The men behind him kept their pitch with a fierceness that came from gratitude and rage braided until you could not tell which was the rope and which the water, and above it I heard Jonas’s laugh and for a moment I thought I had made a mistake and that he had tricked me and that he would open his eyes and scold me and everyone would be alive again.

He didn't trick me. He held my wrist in the very last useful thing his body did, to make sure I didn't flinch and spoil the seam. He put my hand where it had to be so the last note fell exactly on the cut in the floor and traveled to the heel of the world and came back sweetened and stayed. The ash made a black graft on my skin that will not wash for years if ever, and when the light went it went all at once, not with a mess and not with a smell of burning hair and furniture, but with a quiet you only hear when someone who loves you steps out of a room and you understand their footsteps will not come again down that corridor.

The bowl-room held the shape of him for a breath and then for three and then let it go because we did not deserve to keep his body even that long. There was no falling. There were no remains. There was the taste of baking metal on the tongue, yes, because that is what the new world does when it puts its teeth in your story, and there was lemon like a benediction, like someone had sliced the peel very thin and laid it on the shelf where we keep the salt. I felt his voice pass my hand and go into the cut in the floor, and something shivered in the stone, something that may have been relief and may have been an old shell waking.

The guards cried in the rude way of men who think tears are proof of failure and who will never in their lives forgive themselves for being human. The tall one put a hand over his heart as if it were a window blind that could be lowered politely for fifty breaths. The small one stopped worrying his cheek. He said, "Chief," as if my rank had suddenly weighed more and would make my shoulder ache on rain days. The men in the circle kept the pitch until the last light shook out of the lamps that were not lamps, and then as one they let it fall into quiet, and the room rang, and the ring wrote my name on my teeth again and said not yet, not yet, not yet, and then stopped saying anything, and if you have never heard a holy silence you cannot know the size of the wall I leaned against to stay upright.

"Stay a while," Kyo said from the door, and he did not mean stay in the room or stay alive or stay his friend; he meant stay in the exact size of the grief and do not become larger than it or smaller. He stepped in only when the bowl let him, which it did as if it had been told his name by someone it trusted. He took the thread from my hand, wound it into a little coil no bigger than a coin, and pressed it flat with his thumb so that it stayed a loop, not a snake.

"Bring this to your mother," he said, and his voice was steady because he had built steadiness into himself the way men build a stair, one riser at a time. "Hold it to her ear in that kitchen where she keeps the blue willow mug. She'll hear the burr of him under his consonants. It won't last forever. The stone will let the voice go when it has learned it by heart. But for a while, it will come when she calls him, if she calls him from love and not just from pain."

"I promised," I said, and the words were gravel. The ash on my skin had begun to itch, and I hoped it would scar because I wanted a map of what I had done where the world could not avoid seeing it. "He said south. He said the ear was south and the lime kilns and the old shells."

"It was always going to be the shells," Kyo said, and for a moment his eyes went to some place in their own head where a man had sung wrong and the wall had leaned and he had put his shoulder to it and the wall had ended up inside his bones. He looked at the men and the empty where Jonas had been, and he bowed a little to the air because some of us are made that way and there is no saving us from our courtesies. "I'll tell the heatdrain crew to double the line at Eight South. I'll tell Tamsin to borrow any recorder stones from Ward Two's bell makers. There are marks in the soot that will be telling the same truth Jonas did, if we have the patience to read a burn."

My knees shook and then did not. The tall guard came forward and moved as if he might offer to carry me, and I gave him a look that made him remember I had planted both feet at a fire before and it had moved to accommodate me. He stepped back and did the small bow again that men like him make when they have learned, the hard way, that respect is cheaper than dying. The little one pinched the bridge of his nose and then laid his hand flat on the door because he is a sentimental fool and the door will remember him for it when it needs a man to open it gently sometime next winter.

I carried the coil of thread in my left hand because my right was busy with ash. The hall outside had decided to be kind for one foot of its length, the way winter sometimes gives you a day of light so that spring can recognize a pattern when it comes. I walked that foot and then the rest, and the chalk stars in the archery corridor had blurred where children's arms had dragged in the damp, and someone had put a fresh comet on top of the old one, longer, brighter, because we will always make our disasters large enough to amuse us. On the stairs of my mother's building I said Jonas under my breath, because I didn't trust the coil, and he answered in the way the last warmth answers when you open an oven after the cake is gone.

My mother had not moved from the table, but the room had changed around her because there are women who sit very still and teach a room how to hold its own furniture. The tea had made a skin that was not quite skin and not quite honesty. She looked up at me and stood, and she did not ask if I had done it because she had taught me not to linger with knives once their work was finished. I put the coil on her palm, the small warm circle that had pressed against Kyo's thumb and learned to hold shape, and I guided her hand to her ear.

She gasped like a woman who has discovered water lives inside stone if you say the right word to it. Her eyes closed, and her laughter came up first because in the house I grew up in laughter was always the thing that arrives before screaming, like a scout testing a bridge. She whispered something that was not for me, and I heard Jonas answer in the only room left to him, which was my mother's ear. It was the sound of a man who has created a pocket of air under a door with his hand flat to the ground so that a child can breathe smoke and live, and the piece of me that had learned to wear boots to bed cried and did not ask permission.

"It is him," she said, and I had known it would be and still I pressed my hand flat over my own mouth because I did not want to scare the voice off like a bird. "You brought him. You brought the part that knows where the raspberries grow by the broken sink. You brought the way he says your name when he has a knife and is cutting meat and doesn't want to cut you if you come up beside him too fast. You did not bring the rest, and that is right. The rest would have made the good things rot."

"He said south," I said again, because saying a thing often enough makes it a wall you can lean your head against. She nodded, and the coil on her hand warmed and cooled as if it were a living thing, which it was and was not. "He said a mark like an ear. He said the lime kilns. He said the train tunnels. He said someone is teaching stone to hear and then singing death into the part that remembers being shell."

My mother took the coil away from her ear and put it in a little porcelain box that had lost its lid a decade ago, the sort of loss we live with without remark. She set the box on the shelf by the window because she is a woman who makes altars without asking anyone's permission. Then she reached for my face and wiped ash with her thumb. It did not come away. It had decided me, and I had decided it, and now we belonged to each other the way scars belong to knees. "You'll eat," she said, because there are some magics we do not abandon, even when we have become rivers. "You'll wash the parts of you that are still washable. Then you'll go break a man's song."

Tamsin was sitting on the stoop when I came back down, because she is impatient with walls and likes to put her spine where everyone can count it. She stood too fast and swore, because she is also impatient with her own blood. In her hand she had a slate with chalk writing gone soft at the edges, and her hair had broken out of its ties in a way that would have made a dancer sigh. "Ward Three roster done," she said without preamble, because she knows how to speak the language of women who have just walked out of a fire with a piece of their own heart in their hands. "Five undocumented. Two accounted for by minders who lied and later told the truth because someone promised them taro pudding. One that Kyo already flagged for a heatdrain detail. One who went missing during the fourth bell. And one—wait. Listen. You smell like burnt lemon. I thought that wasn't real."

"It is," I said, and she swallowed because sometimes my declarations startled her even when she had already known them. She tilted the slate so I could read and stood close enough that I could smell the iron in her hairpins. "Which one went missing?"

"Choir House runner," she said. "Kid who said the singing was wrong. He's named Clove on the registry but the boys call him Jun because he steals the first month of anyone's attention without trying. He was sent to fetch oil from the back room and didn't come back. The duty sheet says Jonas sent him. The guard on the west stairs said he saw him go towards the old baptistry that got turned into a storage room for broken leashes. Holy to harness is a ratio I hate."

"Broken leashes always have one more bite in them," I said, and my hands remembered the feel of rope I had not touched and that is what makes me dangerous. Tamsin's mouth went thin with the kind of thought that makes her say foolish things to wise men and get away alive because she is too fast to die and too loved to be allowed to. "Kyo is headed to Eight South. You go with him and keep him from picking a fight with the wall if it refuses to admit it is cracked. Send Ness from Heat to the lime kilns with every rag he owns soaked in river-water. And send a runner to Ward Two's bellmakers, like Kyo said. We need stones, and we need them yesterday."

"I'll do it," she said, and then she stood and did not rush out because she wanted to see if I would show her where my seam was so she could put a finger there and keep me shut long enough to breathe. "What about you?"

"I'm going to the baptistry," I said. "I'm going to see if the harness room still thinks it's holy and whether the boy with the month-name got stolen by someone who thinks praise is a leash. If there is ash there from the saints, I want to know if it was taken. And I want to know why there was citrus on a seamstress's collar and lemon in my father's—" I stopped, because Jonas and father are different stones and you can't cross both at once without falling. "Go. Be clever and be quick. They aren't opposites, after all."

She went with that lash of hair and that length of leg that always made me repent every desk I had ever put in her way. The corridor peeled me like a fruit because I had no skin left worth the name, not tonight, not with the bowl still singing in my ear. The door to the old baptistry had a relief over it of a fish that had lost half its tail to a vandal who had decided that hope should not be allowed to have extremities, and someone had scratched a pattern over the old carving that could have been letters and could have been longing. I put my hand on the wood and it remembered Jonas's palm, four days ago, when he came to count harnesses and left without counting because he had found a note in a loop of chain that made him go somewhere else first.

Inside, the air wetted and halted, the way a story stops when it realizes someone is listening and decides to save its best words for later. Broken collars lay in a heap along the east wall, and every one of them had a cut through the latch that had been made with patience and not fury. The old font was a barrel now, and someone had filled it with a neat coil of rope that had not yet been told what kind of person to become. I smelled citrus, not just lemon but the bitter breath of pomelo, a fruit I have never tasted but whose rind I know the way the poor know the smell of money. On the far wall, above the font, someone had drawn the hooked ear again, neat as a stencil and smug as a signature.

"It isn't just south," I said to the room, because I talk to rooms the way other people talk to pets. The echo came back late and thin, as if someone had made it walk down a corridor before allowing it to return. "It means listen. It means obey. It means someone thinks sound is a country and you can annex it with a mark. There is a boy named Clove who doesn't care what you mean, and you took him anyway, because you do not plan to let anyone refuse to be a river if you've decided they should be."

A scrape beneath the barrel answered me, faint but not the kind of faint that comes from puppets. I moved carefully because I like to let a trap think I don't believe in traps until it has wasted its first snap. I lifted the barrel like a woman picking up a pot of stew, even and without complaint, and there he was, Jun/Clove, curled in the little hollow the baptistry's old builders had left for spare water. His hands were bound with a pretty ribbon, the sort women tie around jars of jam when they are showing off, and his face had three bruises on it that someone had arranged as if practicing for a greater art. He smelled of oil and orange peel and fear, and when his eyes found mine they did the thing people's eyes do when they have been told no one is coming and then someone comes anyway.

"They didn't know the old place had a pocket," he said in a rush, because words are the only way some boys know to set their own bones. He struggled up on his elbows and the ribbon tightened and he made a disgusted sound because he was exactly that age. "I hid when they turned the lights to look impressive. It was two of them and one of me and I would have fought but they had that knot, the kind that makes a man sing wrong even if he eats his minders for breakfast. They smelled like fruit. They laughed at the leashes. They kept the scrap of gold thread out of a hat in one of their pockets like it meant something."

"Good boy," I said, and the part of me that is cruel thought, not brave, because brave is a word you put on a person after they're dead and I didn't want to nail that to his forehead. I untied the ribbon with three fast pulls because mothers who cannot keep their children from the river teach them knots. "What did they do with the broken collars? Did they bless them before they carried them or did they spit?"

"They sang to them," he said, and shuddered from disgust and not from awe. He licked his lip the way a child does when it has sugar where it isn't allowed and it isn't sure if the adults have seen. "Soft. Pretty. Like it mattered whether the iron was loved. One of the men had eyes like broth, Chief. The other had a coat that made the sound of soft money. They kept saying listen and then they drew the ear. They weren't clever enough to change their sign; maybe they wanted to be caught. Or maybe they thought no one would look where we keep our shame."

I thought of the small guard biting his cheek, and the tall one lowering his eyes, and I told myself I didn't need to think of them at all, because a mind burdened with faces will never break a wall in the right place. I took the ribbon and wrapped it around my wrist because evidence is any rope you can bring back to a person who refuses to see a pattern unless you tie it to their door. "You did well," I said, and meant it not in the way of officers who throw compliments like cloths at a spill, but in the way of women who saw a boy decide not to be a hero and live and wanted to build that choice a chair to sit in. "Do you know where they went, Clove?"

"They went south," he said, and of course he did, because the city does not need maps when it has its own bones. "They said a thing about the shells and the old machine that breathes for the river. They said the Keeper would learn to sleep like other men. They laughed. I wanted to bite their hands and I didn't. Is Jonas—"

"Don't," I said, and he obeyed, because he had heard that lid close. He looked at my hands and saw the ash, and his face did a strange thing I have only ever seen once, when a boy found a little statue his sister had carved and broken and hid, and he loved her for the breaking as much as for the making. "You'll come with me. You'll show me where the coil on their ribbon snagged, because men like that leave thread when they walk through any room that loves itself. Then you'll go to your bed and pretend to sleep and fail and we will all forgive you for it and expect you to do it again tomorrow. Do you understand your employment?"

"Yes, Chief," he said, and I knew why the boys called him Jun. He had stolen me for a month without moving from the floor.

When we stepped back into the corridor, I felt the river under the stone the way you feel a laugh pass through a pew of children when a bird gets caught in the nave. The valves would be sweating. The lime kilns would be dreaming of their old precision. The tunnels would be thumbing their old maps with fingers that had learned new tricks. South, then. South and the ear and the coral that is stone when it remembers salt. We walked, and for once the ceiling did not shed chalk on our hair, because even the city knew to keep quiet for a little while longer.Clove led like a boy who has always known the city by its undersides. He didn't walk the middle of any corridor if there was a wall to lean into, and he didn't put his feet down where the grit changed color. Twice he stopped and bent to the floor and pointed at nothing I could see, and twice when I lowered my head there it was, the faint smear of oil pushed into a spiral by the heel of a hand. Citrus laid itself over the iron smell the way lace throws itself over a good table. The ear had been chalked at two junctions and thumbed half away by men who didn't want to be caught by their own pride, and still it whispered listen in every curl. Once he made us go back three steps because he heard the river-lung machines change their breath, and I tasted the word careful in my mouth though I didn't say it aloud in case the stone felt flattered.

"Here," he said finally, forgetting to be self-contained and pointing like a child at a puppet show. A ribbon fiber, pale as old sugar, snagged on a bolt under a rail where a trolley cart would have rolled once when rolling had been a flavor in our days. It had the shimmer that fruit peels sometimes carry when a woman has rubbed them on her wrists to pretend at perfume, and there were two gold hairs stuck in it that were not hairs but thread, the good kind, the sort the Seamstress Guild keeps in a box with a lock to be brought out for weddings and new flags. "They went fast enough to forget their own fraying. The one with the money coat didn't want to break stride. He pulled."

The gold made my jaw ache again with the pie I will never again taste. I thought of the seamstress, hands turned up like a woman offering bread to a saint who would prefer milk, and the ear burned near her shoulder. There are few ways gold gets into a poor corridor, and none of them are modest. The hat with the bad brim and the single gold stitch flickered in my mind, and the way the woman on the stair had held it with a greedy gentleness, wanting to love it without making it too sorry for itself. A man had put that thread in his pocket. He had made a trophy of a small domestic mercy. I am not quick to kill, not even inside my head, but there are trophies that should bite.

The south corridors go lower in the last hundred feet. Your ears wait for the pressure change the way a dog waits for its name, and you swallow and nothing moves and you swallow again. The air is full of lime dust in a memory, not in a way that leaves a film on your tongue, but as if the kilns had told the air they used to be important and the air had nodded and put on a white scarf for formality. We crossed two arches the masons had braced with iron only on their undersides, which is a way of telling stone you respect it but you know how it lies, and then the breath of the river-lung machines slid against us like a seal, sleek, not unkind, entirely itself. I put my palm flat to a pillar and felt the city count its own heartbeats. It didn't feel like a bad count yet, but there was a hitch now and then, a small stutter, the sort that a mother hears in a fever and decides to sit up and knit, which is to say, decides to outlast it.

Tamsin came around the last bend with her slate tucked under her arm and her hair suffering from having learned the properties of air. If she had been any other woman, I'd have called it wild; for Tamsin it was an announcement of speed. She had a black stone on a leather thong around her neck. It was one of the bellmakers' recorder stones, veined with quartz like lightning trapped and taught to play nice. Her breath was quick and she wasn't pretending it wasn't.

"Ness is laying wet cloth on the throat of the kilns like he's salving a horse," she said, not wasting greeting and saving salutes for rooms that demand theater. "Kyo is at the elbow of the main vein where the blisters are worst. He says the wall is lying about not leaking and he is leaning to teach it manners. Ward Two sent five stones. One cracked from remembering church too hard, but the others held. You smell like a funeral. I'm saying that because I don't have time to be gentle. Do you have everything you need to be uglier than you want to be?"

"Yes," I said, and Clove looked at her and then at me with the adolescent's fierce nosiness that is as much loyalty as it is hunger, and I told myself that lies are only useful if you intend to sit in them forever. "We found where the ribbon kissed the bolt. The ear is drawn like a landlord's signature in two places you wouldn't notice if you weren't poor. The citrus is loud enough for a deaf man to hear at thirty feet."

"If this turns out to be a cook, I'm throwing myself in a drain," Tamsin said, and then shook her head at herself because even she does not want that to be the joke on our lips. She took the ribbon fiber from me and coiled it around her finger, measuring by instinct, the way a seamstress does without chalk. "Jun," she added, because she is kind with her mouth when it costs her nothing and sometimes even when it costs her a little. "You run behind me. If the wall starts to sing you do exactly what Mara's shoulders do. You don't break rank to be seen."

"I know how not to be a hero," he said with a dignity that would break your heart if your heart was not busy. He adjusted the way his sleeves sat on his wrists because he didn't want to go into battle with anything unfinished touching his skin. "What do I do if my teeth hurt?"

"It means the pitch is wrong," I said. "It means the stone is being woken like a bad child. If your teeth hurt it is not because you are weak. Put your tongue on the back of them and hum. It tells the pain you have a job for it."

We went down the last flight together, three bodies and a stone that remembered bells. The lime kilns sit like old kings pretending at retirement. Their mouths are bricked, their mouths are open, their mouths are carved in patterns that tell you whoever build them loved fire in a way that was not savage. Ness had laid wet cloth across the lower vents and posted two boys with long poles and instructions never to stick the poles in too far because men always put their tools deeper than they mean to. He looked up and gave me that unpretending glare men who work with heat carry as an excuse to soften their kindness later. His arms had white powder to the elbow and the hair there had gone into stiff little curls from steam.

"They're humming like the old days when we were stupid," he said, and if he had been holding a baby he would have spat on its head to keep envy away. "The vein under them is pushing the song up where it wants to be. If someone convinces it the ceiling is a sky, we'll be making a lake out of Ward Seven's washrooms. I hate lakes. They're manners for rivers who forgot themselves."

"Where's Kyo?" Tamsin asked, and Ness pointed with his chin in the way men do when their hands are busy and they know who in the room will translate. There was a throated room past the kilns where pipes gathered, and a narrow ledge, and Kyo was the hinge there as promised, shoulder pressed to stone, mouth set the way it is when he has decided his body is a wedge that will not splinter even if the man using it doesn't deserve the quality of the tool. He tilted his eyes at us without shifting and I read in them the three sentences he didn't have space to say aloud. He liked to pretend he is not dramatic. He is only dramatic about refusing drama.

"Two men," he said when we reached him, parceled out of breath and not the kind you count. "One small. One in a soft coat. They strung harness rings along the old rail bed like a harp. They're pulling a halo through it to teach the wall a wrong song. The man with the broth eyes has a knot on his belt that would make any choir-keeper slap his own mouth. He is a guard I've seen upstairs. He bit his cheek so badly he will drink broth for a week. He knows me, and he does not care that I know him. He thinks all knowing will be drowned by the river they want to birth."

"Collapse is a cradle," I said, and Tamsin spat like Ness would, which is not her habit, which is to say she is learning too fast. The recorder stone against her sternum ticked very softly as if warming its voice. "Do they have a man?"

Kyo's mouth went a line. "Yes," he said. "Young. Halo bright as a copper coin. He hasn't learned pride yet. He thinks obedience is a way to keep other people fed. He will do what they tell him until his body overrules his sense. Then he will boil. The walls here are salted. The collapses will step sideways and find the weak wire in the rail bed instead. It is smart work. It is work done by somebody who knows where engineers live in their heads."

The space beyond Kyo opened into a gallery where the old train would have run. The conspirators had strung copper and rope from block to block, and harness rings from the broken leashes hung in a catenary curve that made me want to unsay mathematics in five languages for the beauty of it and the use. They had smoothed the rings with oil that smelled of orange and the rope with a wax that smelled of bees in spring. The ear mark was chalked at each anchor point, tiny, precise, smug. The small guard stood with the knot-belt in his hands, yellow eyes steady as soup. The other wore a coat that looked soft because it had been cared for by someone whose hands had never burned on a kiln vent, and when he shifted the cloth made that small whisper that money makes when it has been folded often but not in a way that begs.

The young seraph's halo lay low and fat around his shoulders, like lamps on a river boat on an evening when the old songs are allowed, and his face was full of that terrible gorgeousness, as if beauty had purled itself there and decided to get work done. He had a little scar on his chin from a time before the change, and his hair was making an argument with itself about whether to flame or not to flame. His palms were sweating and I saw the kiss of ash on them where someone had taught him to hesitate his light. That someone had not been me. That someone had been a man with slow thumbs and a mason's patience. Rage is a simple fuel. Grief is an engine.

"Stop there," said the soft coat, because men who wear soft things in hard places mistake their own softness for safety. His voice had the roundness of a man whose food had never taught him to be humble. "Chief Vale. Be reasonable. We are doing your work for you. The faster we make south into sea, the faster your wards cool, the faster we can spread out and stop pretending ceilings are homes. The faster the tithes fill without men crying in their bowls. Now is not a time to arrest anyone."

"Arrest is a glove word," I said, because Jonas had handed me a bag full of words and told me to use them like a mother uses a knife: for food or for cutting rope; never for showing off. "You have borrowed some of my walls. That is intimate. You are doing bad work with clever hands. That is worse than an honest wrong. Let the boy go. If you want the stone to listen, use a keep-song. You are not the only ones tired of ceilings."

The small guard looked at me steadily, and if he had been on my side I would have trusted him to guard the step of my son if I had one. There is a wickedness that comes from softness; there is another that comes from being told to be hard for a wage. This was the second kind. He did not look ashamed. He looked careful. He lifted the knot and set it, with a craftsman's economy, between his fingers and the ring line, so that when he pulled the boy's halo would climb and strike the copper in just the ranges that make stone remember the worst days of its adolescence.

"South," he said to me, and it was almost kind. "We are not fools. We are not merely cruel. We are not playing politics. The Chancellor will come after our work is done and make it his. He can write letters. I can write in stone. Which one will last? If we open one vein the pressure on a dozen will sweeten. The men will stop boiling in their beds. Your mothers will stop waking to the smell of ash-and-lemon and think of soup again. You do not have to approve. You only have to stand away."

"You're singing wrong," Tamsin said, and I heard her voice go paper-cut sharp, the way she turns it when she has decided to be an instrument in someone else's ear. The recorder stone at her chest began to vibrate, and Ness, who had come up behind us despite the kilns still needing their wet cloth, made the low humming that's been the lullaby of this city since the first night someone glowed on a street where his boots had been used to being cloth dark. "And you know it. A wrong note persists. It chews. You're not draining anything. You're teaching the stone to panic."

"Panicking stone is better than panicking men," said the coat, and spread his hands in that conciliatory way that means he has already voted and he brought a knife to the meeting just in case. "This is not murder. This is redirection. We only need to—"

I didn't let him finish because speech is sometimes a structure you must interrupt with a brick before any more pretty gets hung on it. I stepped onto the rail bed, ash itching on my palms, and I put my hand up, not touching the halo and still in it, because light learns the edges of the love that makes home for it and hesitates there when it trusts. The boy turned his head a fraction. His eyes were frightened the way water is frightened when it sees fire up ahead and knows there is no path that does not meet it. I thought of Jonas telling me not to be kind and to be exact.

"What is your name?" I asked, and the small guard twitched because names are bridges and he had built his plan without a toll. "Don't give me the one your minder wrote. Give me the one your sister used when you had mud on your knees."

"Rao," he said, and the halo flickered, not so much dimming as shifting its shoulder to make space where I had put my hand. He was younger than my bad habits. He smelled of hot iron and orange and the cheap cloth we all wear when we pretend we don't need beauty to get through a day. "Rao-jo, but I hate the jo. Please don't make me say it. I don't want to." His lip trembled, and I pressed my ash-slick palm in the air above his, under the skin of his light, and he inhaled without choosing to and I had my two breaths and used the second one.

"Rao," I said, like I had known him when he ate other sons' edging from their bread and pretended he hadn't, which is a feral love and the only kind that keeps you alive sometimes. "Listen to me. The note they are pulling out of your ribs is wrong for the stone but wrong for you too. You know the keep-song that the House teaches. Find the lowest rung of it. Set your foot there. Do not climb. Let your light sit with mine like two shoes in the same drawer. When the man pulls, let your breath go sideways into this cut. See it? Here. Here, where the rail meets the floor. There is a lip. The stone will carry your voice and not your flesh. The ash will make the light shy long enough for you to keep your skin."

The small guard pulled. The knot is a clever thief. It found the place at Rao's throat where the change had made an extra line in the music and put its thumb there. The halo rose. The rings sang. The copper made that noise that is almost praise and is really only metal remembering heat. Tamsin's stone woke, and Ness's hum found it, and Kyo put his hand flat to the wall and taught it what a soldier is for when there is no war that deserves him. I set my palm over Rao's, not touching, burning without being burned, and when he took the breath he thought was his last it went into the rail cut instead.

The sound that came out of him was exactly the size of the bowl back at the House in the way that grief and rightness sometimes make distances lie. It hit the lip, slid, went down, and the whole south vein shivered like a fish deciding to dive, and then it accepted the voice as a story and steadied. The ring line did not get the note it wanted and threw a tantrum. The copper shook and flung oil, which set a drop of orange on the soft coat that will never wash out. The small guard bit his cheek once more and bled new over old.

For a heartbeat that lasted three, the light thought about not hesitating, and then it found the ash and remembered saints and did not want to be rude. Rao dropped his shoulders the exact half inch that says survival, and the wrong harmony slid past without catching. I moved left without thinking because the rail bed knew, before I did, that the lime kiln nearest us was going to try to draw breath with all its old appetite and might choke on the wet cloth if a human did not pull it clear. Ness was already there, arms like pillars, catching the cloth with the pole and dragging it like a net. He swore and blessed in the same sentence, which is a skill and not a sin.

The soft coat made a sound like a man who bought a cake and found someone else had cut it and eaten the middle. He reached for the knot. Tamsin darted a hand with that speed that has kept her living when her mouth could have performed the opposite function, and she didn't grab the knot because she is not stupid; she grabbed the small guard's wrist and turned his hand so that the knot's cleverness tangled itself in a loop and stuck. It is a child's trick. It works on men who do not believe hands smaller than theirs can teach them anything. He swore and tried to follow by pulling back and Tamsin stepped in, close enough that her hair brushed his cheekbone and left a bit of wire on his skin, and if he had ever danced he would have recognized the move and survived it. He had not, and she survived him.

Kyo came off the wall only when we didn't need him to break his spine for us and went for the coat with that slow stride that makes his enemies think they have time to be witty. The coat reached under the soft and brought out something that had the tractable arrogance of a permit. He lifted it like a priest lifts a host, which told me everything I needed to know about who had taught him that posture. The Chancellor's sign glowed as if ink could learn to be a worm and wriggle into the dark.

"By authority," he said, and Kyo did not break his hand only because we are sometimes still civilized when it would be better to be animals. "This corridor is requisitioned. This boy is property in the interest of the greater safety. This work is sanctified by the Tithes. If you throw yourselves under the cart of history, Chief, expect to be crushed."

"Property is a word we keep only to remind ourselves we threw it out a generation ago," I said, and I put my hand over the seal and let the ash make it doubt itself just enough that his courage thought twice about standing still. "You do not get the boy. You do not get the stone. You murdered a woman upstairs because she saw your gold thread and your ear and loved the wrong thing in the right way. You put his smell in your clothes and came down here to sing wrong."

The small guard flinched at murdered and I saw the hairline crack where a conscience had been wedged and left for later. The coat didn't. The coat drew himself up like an apology he didn't intend to make. "You think sentimental pieces of sewing matter to this," he said, cruel because he had decided it was efficient. "The Seamstress Guild sells me gold by the yard if I ask and pays no attention to where it goes. The ear is a draft mark, not an art. If we had meant to murder, we'd have chosen a prettier thing."

"Your problem," I said, and my voice put on Jonas without my permission because the bowl was still in my bones, "is that you think pretty stands on the other side of ugly. They're the same gate. We choose what comes under it. You choose collapse. I choose the seam. Either way, somebody bleeds."

Rao swallowed and made the low note again because the body keeps working even while the room is talking nonsense. The recorder stone took it like a cup. Kyo took the coat's wrist and turned it the tiniest bit, enough to make the little bones think about their utility under pressure. Tamsin tugged the knot until the clever thing made a face and agreed to be stupid. The line sagged. The copper went quiet. The ear chalks looked like a child’s lie under lamplight.

"This is not finished," the soft coat said, and because he had run out of theater he fell back on prophecy, which is the most tiresome of the dishonest arts. "Tomorrow the Convocation will take the Tithes and make them sing for the whole city. You will not keep all your Wards asleep. A dozen men will boil no matter how hard you hum. South will have its way. If you do not let us shape the path of the collapse, it will choose the path on its own, and then you will be holding your mother's cup as the tea spills and you will not even get to be angry at the right people. You will be angry at the river."

"Get out," I said, and Kyo helped him understand the topography of that verb by giving him the direction with just enough pressure to bruise dignity and none to shatter bone. The small guard looked at me as he stepped backward and there was a message in the look that he might not even know he had hung on it, the sort of unwilling signaling human bodies do when their owners are not as made for lying as they think. His cheek had its new bite. His knot hung twisted and ashamed at his belt. He glanced at Rao and his mouth did the beginning of a sorry and did not finish. Then he went, and the coat went, and the ear chalks on the anchors looked like ears after someone has shouted into them and the half-deaf has not chosen to be cured.

We stood still together because motion is a lie after work like that. The kilns breathed. The recorder stone ticked itself asleep. Ness patted the cloth as if it were a dog he had not intended to take home and had somehow found sleeping by his bed. Tamsin kept her fingers on the knot as if it might decide it could be clever again in the absence of attention. Kyo watched the path the men had taken and made himself learn their footfalls the way an ex-soldier always teaches himself the cadence of danger, which is not a paranoia and not a virtue and exactly the sort of thing that makes him stay alive.

"Rao," I said at last, and when he lifted his head there was not much light on his face, not because he had dimmed but because he had bent it to a purpose he had not previously practiced, which is exhausting and saints love you for it and saints also cannot breathe on your behalf. "You will go with Ness and let him put lime on your wrists where the harness ring burned you when you did not even notice. You will not think being obedient made you a sinner. Obedience kept your mother's roof whole the year you grew too fast and she ran out of nails. That skill did not become a sin because men with money made it into a tool. Do you hear me?"

He nodded, and because boys need a gesture to hang obedience on, Ness put a big hand on his shoulder and steered him away with the gentleness of a giant who has never had to prove he could crush anything. Tamsin finally let go of the knot and it slumped like a lover who has finally been told no and meant it. She handed me a fragment of copper ring, slick with orange still, and I folded it in a clean rag I keep for playing polite in other people's homes. We don't have many of those homes left, but I am old-fashioned in my sins.

"He's right about one thing," Tamsin said, and now that it would cost us both, her mouth chose honesty out of pique. "The Convocation is tomorrow. The terrace over the old archive is being scrubbed. People are saving crumbs to make cakes for the corridors. If someone pulls a wrong note in that bowl while the Chancellor is counting the Tithes, you'll have a lake in Ward Seven's washrooms and a river through Five's nurseries and a sea where One keeps its salt, and he'll call it an accident and build a statue to the men who burned saving us from it."

"Jonas would have kept the bowl steady," I said, and that sentence is a roof that remains even when the walls meet differently under it. The name burnt. The stone wrote not yet on my teeth again and this time omitted the mercy. "We have his voice, for a time. The bowl in Choir House has it for longer than my mother's porcelain box will. The recorder stones will hold whatever this place will give us. We have the boy's name. We have a knot that won't be clever again for a few hours. We have two men who think authority is a cloak that makes them handsome. We have an ear that points south and means listen. I can work with that."

Kyo leaned back into his hinge using himself as a mirror for the wall and made that small noise he makes when he decides not to argue because he is saving his mouth for a better fight. "You'll be at the Convocation?" he asked, not because he needed the answer but because he wanted to place it on the map in his head where he keeps the frets of his understanding.

"I will," I said. "I'll be there with ash under my nails and with a stone that can play back what sounds like right when men with coins insist wrong is sufficient. I'll be there with a boy named Rao keeping the low note at my back and with Ness ready to throw wet cloths at any kiln that starts to remember pride. You'll be there because I am not brave enough to be pretty about it. Tamsin will be there with her paper-cut voice and her dancer's bones pretending to be a cop's. Clove will pretend to sleep and fail and I will pretend not to see him in the shadows because someone has to stand where Jonas used to sit. My mother will have her ear to a coil in a porcelain box and spit if I don't speak before anyone else does."

"Good," Kyo said, and the word went into the stone and came back with a small sweetness because sometimes the city agrees with us when we least deserve it. He stooped and picked up a flake of lime, turned it in his fingers like a coin, then set it on the rail cut where it could learn the new song we had just wedged into the old groove. "South won't stop pulling," he added, and looked at me with the sort of bleed in his eye he lets only me see. "It never does. We put work against it and call it loving the city. We are liars and we are right."

When we came back up past the kilns, the air grew less insistent and more complicated. The corridors toward the House carry other people's breaths the way a shawl does after a party. We passed a wall where children had pressed their hands into damp clay and written their names in mirror letters because the clay does that and the hands do that and no one wants to fight both, and I touched one that said Rina in backward and wondered where she'd gone and whether she had a god in her house who made her soup salt wrong. The chalk comet in the archery corridor had gained a tail, an ambitious one with three colors in it, and someone had sketched a boat underneath with sticks for men, which is the sort of optimism that keeps a roof from collapsing simply to escape it.

At the corner that separates my precinct's offices from the block where my mother keeps her furniture obedient, Kyo put his hand on my arm and I understood that the hinge wanted to say something that was not about walls. He looked at the ash on my skin and didn't tell me to wash it off. He looked at the coil of thread in the pocket where I kept my small, permitted reliquaries. "He told you south and you brought it to us," he said, which is a sentence you could say about a saint and be forgiven. "He also told you to make a joke for your mother while you murdered him. Did you?"

"He did," I said. "I will be tormented by the buttons of our friend's coat for as long as I own a shirt. My mother laughed first, as she does when she is standing on a jetty and the tide is angry because it thinks it's the only thing with claws. The coil sang back. It will fail. I am greedy enough to be grateful before it does. Kyo. The small guard. He will come back. Not because he is brave. Because his mouth began that sorry and it will itch at him like a shirt someone else sewed."

"Do not make him your project," Kyo said quickly, and then softened because he had not earned the right to be harsh with me tonight and he knows it. "But if he comes, make him useful or make him harmless. Not both. Both breaks the spine of men like that and then we clean up love and bone for months. There is not enough ash in the old churches to slow that light."

"Tamsin," I said, because I needed a sentence that had teeth without biting me. "Bring the recorder stones to Jonas's bowl and teach them how to listen without resenting their teachers. Bring Ness a cot if the kilns won't sleep. Bring Clove a sandwich because if he is going to follow me like a month he might as well learn that I will feed him. Write down the marks that look like ears. Every one. Chalk where we can, paint where the chalk won't stay. When we find them again, I don't want to ask my memory to flatter me."

She gave me that grin she saves for when she has decided she would die for me as long as I don't make her say it. "Yes, Chief," she said. "No cleverness unless it runs next to quickness. No dancing in front of statues even if they like it. No hand in any pocket without two witnesses. I am not a child. I am something worse. You will pay for that sandwich."

"I will pay for it with a button," I said, and we let that be joke enough for the moment it took to barrel our grief into something that wouldn't set tails of chalk afire. I sent them left, to work, and I went right, to my mother, because I am an honest woman only about the things that will not let me be anything else.

She had put the porcelain box on the table and the coil lay in it like a snake that wasn't a danger to anyone anymore except to adversaries of silence. She had her ear on the edge of the box and her fingers curled around it the way she had held my wrist when I had first learned to walk on the shelf of the old drainage canal and not fall into water that has fewer manners than it claims. When she heard my boots, she didn't look up. She tilted the box toward me with a coaxing movement as if it were a dish of something steaming.

"He's telling Ness to damp the fourth vent when it coughs in the morning," she said, lips barely moving as if sound might frighten sound away. "He is saying he doesn't know why he always wants lemon when he shouldn't. He is saying tell Mara not to practice kindness like a religion, because it makes her forget that sometimes the body of God looks like a knife."

We do not always deserve the things we are given. We do not always have to. I sat and put my hand next to hers and we listened to a man we had unmade on purpose advise us on how to keep the stones calm and the vents quiet and the city from drowning in its own good intentions. The coil warm-cooled against her ear when he laughed, and somewhere in the south a lime flake settled into the groove we had taught it.

Later, when the coil tired and the stones upstairs needed to be taught and the bowl in the House would have to be hummed to so it didn't think it had been abandoned by its favorite voice, I walked back to my office where the letter lay like a dead thing finally learning its place. I lit a lamp. I put the soft coat's seal under the flame and watched the ink pretend it was iron for a moment and then give up and become ash. It smelled like dead fern. I didn't feel better, but my fingers stopped wanting a knife for no reason at all, which was a kind of rest.

Tamsin's chalk list of ears came back with a boy's handwriting at the bottom, the not-brave print of Clove, who has decided to be mine whether I asked or not. South. South. South. West? And then an arrow, small, timid, pointing toward the old archive terrace where tomorrow we would dress up and count. The mark there had been done with paint, not chalk. Paint that won't lick off in a night. Paint that had oranges' gloss and a smell like a story about summer. Someone had carried fruit oil up to the place where we pretend to be dignified. Someone had drawn a listening there and walked away without anyone asking whose ear it was.

I stood and felt the city breathe at my back, and the bowl in Jonas's House resonated in my ribs, and the coil in the porcelain box warmed the air, and Kyo leaned his shoulder into a wall that despises falling and learned to be its hinge a little harder. The lime kilns slept with cloth at their throats. The river-lung machines counted their own teeth. The chalk comet on the ceiling sprouted a second tail because we cannot help ourselves when it comes to dressing our fate.

Tomorrow was the Convocation of Tithes and I was out of buttons and mercy was a sport I'd have to play with knives in both hands. I put my palms flat on the desk and the ash stuck and didn't and I thought, all right, south. All right, ear. All right, lemon. We will carve this without collapsing. We will be exact. And if collapse comes anyway, we will at least be there to argue with it, which is the only honor we are afforded in the rooms where we still believe we belong.By morning the bowl had learned to whisper in another man's timbre and our rooms tasted of thyme. I lay with my ear to the tabletop like a child eavesdropping on the floorboards and felt the smallest edge of Jonas in there, the burr he never could hide, the exacting patience that turned even a cough into instruction. He didn't pour. He wetted. It would have been arrogance, after all, to flood a city with a dead man's voice. I got up before the tea turned from its honest heat to that metallic sulk and scrubbed the ash from the places I did not want to keep it while leaving it where it had decided to live. The mirror was not kind and I didn't ask it to be. When I buttoned my jacket, the empty where the letter had been pressed against me felt like an unowned gravity, and I held onto that, because sometimes absence is a better compass than any presence we've been bribed with.

Kyo came with a bundle of cloth on his back and the look of a man who has already argued with two walls and won at least one of them. He set the bundle down and unrolled wet linen compiled with a tenderness that would have shocked anyone who had only met his shoulders. "Ness says the kilns will behave if we keep treating them like jealous uncles," he said, and he did not apologize for bringing a domestic into my office when I had murder still staining the edges of my nails. "Ward Two sent three more recorder stones. One is a prima donna and will sulk if placed near iron; the other two don't know their own worth, which is better, for now. Tamsin is eating something that claims to be porridge and is really a declaration of war against teeth. She'll be here when it learns humility."

I took the stones and they thrummed in my palm the way a bird does when you cup it and it has decided not to die of your kindness. Their veins were pale lightning, the kind we remember from a sky that used to touch us without asking for blood. "We fix the bowl first," I said. "Jonas's voice won’t carry if the room thinks it has the right to edit his grammar. Then we dress the terrace like a sickroom and pretend the silk is for celebration. The ear on Tamsin's slate put its little arrow on the archive—paint, not chalk. They want the Convocation stage to be a mouth. We salt its lips. We put sugar on its tongue. We teach it to be petty."

"You know how to make a room petty," Kyo said, and if he'd said it wrong it would have cut, but he said it the way you tell a carpenter she's remembered to bring the thin nails, the ones that don't split old wood. He sat, not because he is the sort of man who sits in other people's offices, but because the night had arranged itself inside his bones in a way that demanded a chair. "The small guard visited his mother and didn't go home. One of our runners watched him climb into the corridor over the bellmakers and not come down for twenty minutes. He left with his mouth set like a badly drawn seam. I don't know what that means yet. But his face is not an easy one for me to forget, and I've tried."

"He will stand where he can see the bowl and the rail bed at the same time," I said. "He is a man who likes to keep two bad choices in view, as if that makes him honest. We put Kyo-shaped metal where he expects air. We make him choose quick instead of careful. He is worse at quick."

Tamsin banged the door with her boot instead of her hand because her hands were full of paper, and the paper was full of other people's arrangements. She had written until the chalk made her joints sting, and the top sheet had a child's neatness given up on and replaced with a clarity she had to wrestle for. "Roster confirmations ready," she said, dropping the stack and catching the top two sheets with the clumsy grace of a woman who always will be sorry to watch anything fall. "Choir lineups vetted. All our men have minders who do not drink while on duty and who can sing in the right key even when their feelings are hurt. Ward Three has seven undocumented. Two will be brought to the House or brought to me, depending on who runs faster. Four in Ward Five will try to attend the Convocation without permission because they are sweet and proud and dumb. I'm on the doors. You smell like a fireplace after a soup day. I didn't think language could do that."

"Language does everything it shouldn't when tired," I said. "Have you eaten?"

"Porridge is a lie," she said, making a face that would have loosened knots on a better day. "Clove is carrying sandwiches like a guilt. He says he'll be your shadow even if you pretend he's a wall. He stole two oranges from Ward Eight's black market last week and gave one to a girl and she slapped him because she thought he was implying something about her breath. He doesn't understand this new world and that's why I trust him."

"We use the oranges," I said. "We use the scent. If the terrace smells like citrus already, their paint-signature won't get to be a herald. It will be a flavor in a stew. They'll lose their pride. Pride trips. We pour lemon water down the drains around the stage and we rub the railings with rind. Let the Chancellor explain away the smell of a market at his ceremony of order."

Kyo smiled with the one corner of his mouth that had not been trained to be a hinge. "He'll call it a festival," he said. "He will pretend he invited the smell."

"He didn't invite Jonas," I said, and that name did what it did now in a room—made space and took it. Jonas in the bowl made a shape in the world that the world then had to walk around. "We let him pretend a few things in exchange for the one thing he can't pretend. He can't pretend the city didn't hear his men sing wrong in a place where wrong means drowning."

The terrace over the old archive used to be the roof for a building that kept books. The books went first, turned to pulp by the first weeks' steam, and then the roof braced itself into usefulness by consenting to be a stage. The masons had laid trusses under it like Thieves' Sabbath ribs and the acoustics had not forgiven them and then had. By the time we got there, people had begun to pretend it would be a holiday. Someone had stitched bunting from cloth so tired it could hold only bright. A woman had carried up a table that had no leg worth the name and given it dignity with a brick and a folded shawl. The smell of oranges already lifted, sour and clean, like a solicitous aunt who cannot keep from washing the back of your neck with a spit-wet cloth. Children were drawing stars under the benches with chalk and getting away with it because no one could bring themselves to scold a small hand on a day like this.

Tamsin put her palm on the stage's lip and wrinkled her nose. "Paint," she said. "Not made with any charity. The ear is under the runner closest to the south parapet. If I scratch it with my ring it will laugh at me."

"Don't scratch," I said, and took the lemon from Clove's pocket without asking because it had only ever lived there to be stolen. We cut it with someone's table knife and rubbed the linseed and orange oil on the steps, on the railings, on the risers where men's heels would tap impatience. The painted ears looked less like signs after that and more like soot where a kettle had hissed. Kyo measured the terrace's ribs like a man memorizing a lover's scars and then nodded to the places where a harness harp could be anchored. We salted them until our fingers stung.

Dareth arrived with his coats and his collars and the sort of brightness rich men learn to wear when they think they have invented light. He likes a stage the way a cat likes a high shelf. He took the step that will roll under the weight of some men's bodies and didn't notice. His finger brushed the rail where we had rubbed lemon and he sniffed and smiled the kind of smile that still worships mirrors. "What a thoughtful people we have," he said to nobody and everybody. "They bring summer with them to a chamber and winter thanks them for the visit. Chief Vale. I was sorry to miss your call last night. I hear you did what had to be done without demanding an audience."

I put my hand behind my back because there would be ash on it still and I didn't want to give him the right to say the words death and duty in the same breath near my skin. "I do many things without an audience," I said, because a city dies of lies as easily as from floods. "The Convocation is ready. The keep-song is set. The men will tithe under supervision, with binding only if they ask for it."

"Ask," he said, and it would have been mocking if he hadn't sounded genuinely curious. "It continues to astonish me where you have taught them to put their own wrists. Did Choir House furnish sufficient oil? I could have had a case brought from the old chapel in Ward One that my men keep for state occasions."

"We have oil," I said. "We do not have Jonas."

For a moment his lash flickered in that reptilian way his vanity had learned when decent men were still on the surface making gardens. "Loss is never punctual," he said finally, which is the sort of observation a man like him thinks makes him compassionate. "What he built will outlast his pride. That is all any of us get."

"If you believe that, you will die surprised," I said, and he laughed as if we were two people on a balcony looking at a world that would never invite us down into the room. He nodded at one of his men and that man—new coat, new boots, soft hands and a mouth trying to learn how to be an instrument—stepped to the edge of the terrace and lifted his arm to show the time. Banners were pushed up. The bowl below us hummed with a living noise as men arrived in the ranks the House had taught them and women and children sat on steps and on one another's coats where they could. The recorder stones lay under the stage like polite dogs. Kyo became part of a column.

Jun/Clove slipped to my side with a sandwich and the sort of news you have to have stolen to obtain. "The small guard is on the south stair," he said, and he didn't keep the satisfaction out of his voice because he is young enough to still relish being useful and because he is old enough now to understand that usefulness can be traded for a pocket of safety if he is clever. "He keeps touching his cheek. He borrowed a boy's handkerchief and then gave it back without wiping the blood off. He's by the second ear. He hasn't noticed that the lemon made the paint sulk."

"Good," I said. "If he doesn't notice the small humiliations, he'll step into the larger one. Stay behind Tamsin. If she ducks, you duck. If she sings, you sing. You are a sandwich with legs. Your only job is to be in my way if I forget I'm not immortal."

"Yes," he said, and he grinned in earnest and I imagined Jonas cuffing him lightly and taking the sandwich anyway so he did not forget to eat. I went to the lip of the terrace and looked down into our bowl. The men glowed with the embarrassed courage of candles. The House minders stood their places with oil on their thumbs and ash under their nails. I blew out my breath and the bowl caught it and handed me back the ghost of a chord that was not mine. I put my hand flat under the rail where the wood had become the city's ear.

Jonas spoke first, not because he had arranged it, but because even dead he knows when the quiet will accept him. The recorder stones nuzzled each other and decided not to be jealous. His voice went into the bowl and a dozen heads lifted because a dozen recognized a weight they had put on their laps in other rooms when the world told them to cry and they had chosen not to. He did not sing. He put a low hum under the House minders and under my men's ribs and under the thin floor that separated the stage from south, and for all the power Chancellor Dareth had gathered in his coat and in his ring and in his mouth, this was the governing melody.

The Convocation of Tithes is older than almost everything else we have left. We had to invent it the year we realized men were going to light when sorrow touched them as easily as when bread did and that we had to build a place where it could be caught and turned to water and air and heat for all of us without any one person drowning. The bowl was not made for kindness. We sang it into kindness, as you sing a colt into accepting harness. The ritual itself is nothing. Maybe if we were a better people we wouldn’t need the theater. But theater dissuades panic.

Dareth came forward with his hands spread and said the words he had learned to say and none of them were wrong. He spoke of balance, of burden, of generous men and grateful rooms, and if his mouth had ever been good at the keep-song the bowl might have forgiven him for being the sort of priest who counted his own footsteps on the altar. As it was, the stone listened to him the way a cat listens to a person it has not yet decided to trust: politely and without granting any part of itself. He called the names that the House had assigned the tithers and each man said present with more dignity than any of us had the right to ask of him. We had seeded ash under the lips of their palms. We had rubbed lemon on the thresholds. We had salted the anchor points where a wrong note might have tried to fasten itself.

The first halo flared so tenderly even I didn't flinch. A man named Cread lifted his chin and the light came up like someone turning the knob on a stove you learned to love because it worked always and did not explode. The House minder put oil where he'd been taught and Cread smiled at him like a boy at the baker who didn't slap his hand away from the crust. The bowl took the light, turned it into warmth, and then into hum. The river-lung machines liked it. The heatdrains to the south sighed. Jonas kept his note like a father under a child's hand.

On the south stair, the small guard took two steps down and then back up and then turned and set a foot against the wall as if waiting for it to bite him and was irritated that it did not. His knot hung from his belt and the cleverness had been beaten out of it by Tamsin's wrists, but cleverness sneaks back when attention is turned. I saw his fingers touch it the way a tongue touches a broken tooth. The soft coat was nowhere in sight, but his perfume had left a ghost on the air—linen and anger, a man who ironed a shirt in rooms where we scrubbed walls and held our breath for the ceiling.

Two men tithed, three, and the room stayed standing because the room had no reason yet to do anything else. The ear under the runner warmed where the lemon had argued with it. A child dropped a chalk and pretended he had not. Clove breathed next to my hip as if he was imitating the bowl. Tamsin whistled a note so low only bones could hear her, but bones are our best friends. Kyo scanned and set and scanned. Ness hummed. My mother was at home with her cheek against a porcelain box and if I imagined I could feel the warmth of that small coil from here it was because I wanted more than any decent person should.

The fault came when Dareth raised his hand for his favorite part, the place where he gets to act as if he is an old priest holding a city together with a rope no one else can see. He likes to ask for a chord from "the men of Ward One through Nine" as if none of us live in the cracks, and he likes to pretend he knows what the chord should be and always has. He lifted and the men answered, beautiful, obedient, and the small guard chose that breath to move. He slid his hand—not to the knot, which would have made Tamsin move, not to the rail, which would have made me shoot him in the throat if I had been a different Chief—he slid it to the anchor where the paint ear sat under grace and he pressed two fingers into the wood and then moved them and if you have not lived under roads you will not know how that matters.

The harp was invisible because it had been built into the geometry last night by someone who had learned music in a school and engineering in a heatdrain room and cruelty in an office. He didn't need rings if he had the stage. He had the anchors and the rails and the steps and the runners and the hollow inside the wood where sound goes to consider its options. The small guard pressed, lifted, pressed, and the wrong note began.

It was tiny, as all bad begins are. A shimmer at the edge of Dareth's chord like a woman clearing her throat in a pew. If I had been a better person, I would have thought of prayer. Instead I put my mouth against the rail where the lemon had brightened the old varnish and I sang the low keep the way Jonas had, and not like him of course, because I am a mortal with more teeth than grace, but close enough that the bowl hesitated before flattering anyone else, and in that hesitation Kyo moved.

He didn't grab the small guard. He didn't break his wrist. He stepped between the man's fingers and the ear as if entering a dance, and the guard stiffened with the panic of someone whose courage was not of the sort that loves improvisation. Tamsin was already there, a hair's flick, and she raised her recorder stone in her palm and tilted it so the wrong note slid into it like a fly into a flask. Ness reached up from below with a pole and knocked the second anchor with a neat contempt that told anyone who was watching that he had been born with a gift for teaching architecture its manners. The ear smeared. The harmonics howled and died like wolves who found the wrong ridge.

"Don't," I said to the small guard, and because I have learned to speak when a man's face is still, he heard the part of the word that was a past, and the part that was a future, and the part that was a name I did not yet know to use. "Don't make me take your little honesty and break it. You will make it so I have to, and then you'll spend the rest of your life worshipping men who were not good enough for the altar you built them. Stand back. Let the bowl breathe."

He looked at me and hated me for telling him the truth, because that is the particular injury I do to men like him. He pulled his fingers from the ear and shook his hand as if the wood had bitten him, which it had, in a way. He watched the bowl as if it might yet deliver his righteousness to him in the shape of a flood. It didn't. Dareth was still speaking, oblivious to the way his ceremony had been about to become an accident we would have called a tragedy for the next three years to make ourselves feel we were not complicit.

Tamsin caught the wrong note in her stone and played it back like a bad joke at the end of a funeral where someone needed to get people eating and she didn't care who noticed her savagery, and the bowl rejected it, proud as a cat asked to do a trick. The men kept their chord because Jonas was holding them where I could not. The recorder stones under the stage woke and hummed, and the low note went wider, safer. Dareth looked up then, finally, because it is hard to ignore a chorus when it includes an absence you ordered and get to see haunting you anyway.

He did not stop. He is a politician. He knows when to bring a thing to an end he does not control. He lifted his hand a little higher, asked for mercy with his ringed palm, got it without deserving it, and lowered his arm as if he had invented relief. He turned to me and smiled with gratitude as a weapon. "Chief," he said, and the word was as slick as oil. "Your work is always impeccable."

"The stage had a splinter," I said, and that was almost true. "We sanded."

He nodded, then gestured to his men, and they began the slow labor of ending a ritual without anyone being near enough to break into clapping. The bowl took the last lights without boiling anything. The House minders kissed foreheads without looking at whose, because there are days we practice being civilized only by counting repetitions of kindness. People began to think of their soup pots and their wash basins and their bed-rags and all the other rooms that will swallow the remains of a holy morning without asking permission.

I caught Kyo's eye and he flexed one hand, which for him is a victory cry. The small guard stood very straight and waited to see whether I would use the space between his bones to hang the rope he had brought. I went to him not because I wanted to but because it is one thing I am still good at: walking directly toward the person who would like to slice my face to feel he has done a good day's work. Up close his eyes were more the yellow of egg yolk than broth. He chewed a little, not his cheek this time but the inside of his lip, like a person trying not to eat words that might nourish someone else.

"Your name," I said, and when he didn't answer I added, "I can look it up. That is not a threat; it is a courtesy. If I look through paper first, I will not be kind."

"Ryhden," he said, as if we were exchanging something cheap. "My grandmother used to call me Rye when she baked. I don't like it anymore, but she is dead, so it belongs to her. You will use the other."

"Ryhden," I said, which is a mouthful and I let my mouth do it anyway. "You are not clever enough to make knots like the one on your belt. That is not an insult; it is a compliment to people whose hands have to sing ten hours a day to learn such songs. You pressed the stage because someone told you a secret in a room where secrets make you feel generous. He did not tell you about the woman upstairs with the gold thread in her collar and he did not tell you about the boy we pulled out of the baptistry and he did not tell you that when the kilns cough they spit lime that sticks to a baby's lungs. He told you about a lake and you saw a boat and forgot that most of us don't know how to swim."

He fought not to flinch, and succeeded. A muscle in his jaw did something I recognized: the movement a face makes when it hears a well-trained lie slop and slosh and realize it is leaking. "You will put me in a room then," he said. "You will make me scold my own hands until they go stupid. You will tell me to say I was wrong. Chief, I am not wrong. We cannot keep a city like this. We can turn corridors into streets if we stop treating stone like a coward."

"You can," I said, because men like him forget that my first sacrament was a hammer. "You just don't get to do it by singing at the parts that remember being seashell in the wrong key. You want street? You help me cut the seam. You want a lake? I will drown you myself, to save everyone else the courtesy. Do you know what Jonas called south last night when he died because the Chancellor sent me a letter? He called it a cradle. He said that's what they think collapse is. A cradle. You know what's true about cradles? They break if you keep swinging."

He closed his eyes, and that was the first honest thing I had seen him do since yesterday afternoon. He took his hand off the ear and wiped his fingers on his coat, which he would regret later when he realized lemon does not love cloth. He said, "You will ask me to come to the House."

"I will ask you to come to the heatdrain," I said. "I will ask you to do what men like you hate best. I will ask you to be patient with pipes. I will ask you to hum the low note for three hours without attention. If you do it all day and don't bite anything that isn't bread, I will give you back your knot and let you be clever again aboveground where clever doesn't drown children. Or you can run to your coat and tell him you tried. He will kiss your cheek where you bit it and give you a new trick. Pick."

His face moved once. He looked past me at Dareth, who was already receiving four people's homage and two people's resentment and a child’s admiration because the child had a wreath and didn't know where else to put it. He looked at the stage. He looked at the ear. He looked at Kyo, who looked back at him like an accusation that had agreed to be a bridge. "I don't like patience," he said, confessing in a ruinous whisper. "I don't like rooms that ask me to lower my voice. It feels like surrender."

"It is practice," I said. "If you do it wrong for a day, you get worse at it. If you do it right for a day, you get the beginnings of another day. We don't have many beginnings left that are cheap. Take one when it offers itself."

He nodded, the smallest pivot a neck can make and still claim to have turned. He did not ask for protection. He did not ask for mercy. He said, "Ryhden," once like a goodbye, and then he went down the stairs toward Ness and the wet cloths and the pipes and a job that would give him nothing to boast about when he got home. Kyo breathed out. Tamsin flexed her hand at the recorder stone as if she had just strangled a snake and was ashamed at how good it had felt.

Dareth's men carried the platform into its afternoon humility and people began to practice hunger like a language. The House minders wiped oil from their thumbs. I stood in the place where a man had tried to turn a stage into an instrument and felt the wood apologize to my palm for having been used without consent. Clove sidled near because he is incapable of walking like a person who's not stealing the air. He held out another sandwich and did not quite meet my eyes.

"I didn't duck," he said, daring me to scold him so I could forgive him and not feel useless. "But I didn't try to be the person on the stage with a name either. I think that means I'm getting old and good and neither of those are things anyone should have to be at my age. Do I get a prize?"

"You get to clean the railings," I said. "You get to wipe off ears without making a show of it. You get to carry a recorder stone to the House and put it under the bowl where it can learn to be a room when it's not being a rock. You get to ask my mother whether she needs a second coil for her box and run when she says no, because she likes to chase and she bites."

He grinned at that, bright and foolish and decent. He ran. I turned and found Tamsin watching the Chancellor with a look I had never seen on her face before. It was not admiration and not disdain. It was a craftsman's contemplation, the way a seamstress looks at a bolt of cloth that is good material and a ruinous color and will have to be dyed and cut and resold as something else entirely. "He will try to own the save," she said, not accusing me for putting him in the position to do so, because she knew as well as I did that he would have found his way there with or without our hands on the railing. "He will make a speech about vigilance. He will talk about their courage. He will not say your name. He will not say Jonas. If he says Jonas, I will spit."

"He will say Jonas when he names the next tithe and he will think it exonerates him," I said. "He will not call south a cradle. He will not say ear. He will put his hand on the head of a boy and tell us what that has taught him about governance. Then he will ask me into a small room and he will give me an order that will read like a gift."

"And you will," she said, and then stopped, because she has learned to trust my seam, not my face. "Do you have a plan that isn't just grit and decency? Because I like grit and decency but they unwrap poorly. We need a trick."

"We have three tricks," I said. "One is a man who thinks about patience in a room that requires it. Another is a stone that knows the taste of the wrong note and will spit it if someone tries to feed it that flavor on a silver spoon. The third is that boys like Clove always show up where they shouldn't with sandwiches and see where everyone's eyes are pointed. People like the soft coat forget their puppets are always watched by children. And we have a voice. For a while. We use it until the coil fails."

She nodded. She hates tricks that are really just other people's kindness, but she will take them when there is no better kind. The bowl felt us exhale and exhaled with us. Jonas rose through the floor once more, not a speech, only a line like a carpenter snapping chalk, the sort that lays the first honest direction across a stubborn board. "Dol," he said, that low note masons hum under a wall they are trying to convince not to lean. It went into the recorder stones and into the House down the corridor and into the heatdrains and south where the shells shout their old salt names to one another, and over us, like a little cloud that didn’t mean rain and meant everything else.

In the hush that follows work, Dareth did what Dareth does. He made a show of thanking the men who belong to him only on paper. He mentioned Ward One and Nine and was very careful not to say Three more than once. He said safety five times and order six and future seven because he believes in pattern instead of mercy. He caught my eye and smiled and I let my face be wood. When we turned away from one another I could feel his attention on the back of my neck and I did not give him the dignity of shivering.

In the hall behind the terrace, where the boards creak in the old language and ghosts rehearse their next lives, the soft coat waited. He leaned on a post, which had not consented to any of us, and watched me with the calm of a man who had watched his plan buckle and still believed in his plan more than in his own good sense. "You will regret what you have done," he said pleasantly, as if offering me fruit. "You could have managed collapse. You could have been the woman we said later had saved the city by burning two wards and flooding three. They would have named a corridor for you. They would have made a song. Now you'll leak. You'll itch. Your city will be the sort we mock in our children's stories because it tried to be honorable in a century that does not reward it."

"If you have children," I said, "they will learn to spit, for their own survival. You chose a cradle and called it a plan. I chose a seam and called it love. Our stories will judge us long after our good rooms have learned our names. If you touch that ear again, I will take your buttons."

He blinked at the last, as if no one had ever stolen his dignity with a dead man's joke before. When he left, he took nothing but his self-approval. He will need it. It breaks worse than glass when dropped.

By the time we made it back to the House, my mother had put the porcelain box under the breadcloth because she had decided to enjoy having a secret even if it was only for ten minutes. She had cut three slices from a loaf you would have sold an apology for last week. She did not rise when we came in. She did not stand to attend to my bruises or Kyo's scuffs or Tamsin's hair. She tapped the box twice the way she used to tap my shoulder to indicate I had missed a crumb on my mouth and said, "He thinks you have not yet learned to lie when you need to and he is proud of you for that and ashamed for the rest of us and he says the fourth kiln will cough at dawn and you should be there and he says if the boy named Ryhden comes he should not be offered tea because it will make him think he is forgiven and a person must not be forgiven until they've been tired."

"Tell him to stop trying to be three people at once," I said, and knew how cruel it was to say that to a coil of wire. "Tell him to keep the bowl even if I make a mistake. Tell him I will make a mistake."

She pressed her ear to the box and smiled with her teeth like a woman who still likes wine when she has no business doing so. "He says to bring him the recorder stones because he wants to meet anyone you are courting to be his substitute. He says to tell the Chancellor to put his coat down and learn to use his hands for something that matters. He says to tell Ness that if he shaves his arms the hair will only come back more stubborn and the city has no patience for that."

Kyo laughed then, a rusty thing, and put his hand on the lintel because he has made a habit of blessing my mother's door without sacrament. Tamsin untied her hair and tied it again more carefully because she hates being beautiful by accident and adores being beautiful on purpose. Clove brought in a recorder stone the way boys carry cats, proud and hopeful and a little wrong, and set it on the floor before the bowl and the bowl canted its hum to meet it like an old friend being introduced to a new acquaintance. It was a room that could breathe again. It was a day we had not drowned. We would pay for it later, because nothing is free, but the bill is another room's problem.

In the dead pocket of the night between the Convocation and dawn, when the city pretends it sleeps and actually counts, I sat at my desk and copied the ear exactly as the terrace had painted it. I put Jonas's south next to it. I drew the lime kilns at the quiet angle that lets them pretend to be retired. I wrote Ryhden, because names help even when they do not. I burned the soft coat's seal into gray and swept it into a jar so I could use the ash for something that deserved it. Outside, I heard a chalk comet's tail get longer and a child being shushed and a woman decide not to shush the second time because it was his joy and joy ought not to be stinting.

Morning comes down here like a rumor. It crept into the room with the first cough of the fourth kiln and a drop of water in a place there should not be water. We went because Jonas had said we should, and because we were always going to, because that is my particular sin: to glance at a door before it is opened and pretend I had not been watching it the whole time. Ness had his cloth. Kyo had his hinge. Tamsin had three knots she had bullied into stupidity and one that refused and would have its day. Ryhden stood at the elbow of a pipe and glared at his own hands as if they had betrayed him by existing. He did not look at me and I did not ask him to.

We held the cough. The lime that would have gone into a child's breath went into a cloth. The stone that would have panicked remembered its keep-song. The old train bed hummed under us, not wrong, not yet. The archive terrace forgot the ear entirely for an hour because someone had set children to washing the railing and you cannot hold malice when you are being wiped by hands that small.

It will not last, any of it. Collapse is patient. The coat will try again with a trick that involves a ceiling I have not yet learned to worship, some ventilation shaft I have not made a prayer over. Dareth will craft a paper that looks like a favor. Ryhden will decide he is tired one day and his hands will itch for cleverness that hurts someone. The boy named Rao will think obedience a sin because it saved him and that is a lie and Tamsin will slap him for it and then feed him because that is what she does. Ness will fall in love with a kiln and be ashamed of himself. Kyo will choose a wall that does not deserve him and stand anyway. The chalk comet will sprout a third tail because the joy of children has no respect for tragedies that prefer to be singular.

But for now we have a voice that still hums when my mother wants to hear whether tea is hot. We have an ear to mark and a way to unmark it. We have fruit peel and ash and salt and cloth and patience and tricks. We have the sort of afternoon where you can teach a boy how to hum into the back of his teeth so his head doesn't ache and feel like you have accomplished something equivalent to winning a small war. We have south, which will always be there, its own mouth, its own cradle, its own grave. We have the seam. We will cut it until it learns the shape of mercy and if mercy refuses, we will still cut; we are those people now. We will keep the bowl from boiling. We will let the light hesitate just long enough to remember our names, and if it forgets, we will remind it with whatever levers we still own.We did not get a day of quiet after the Convocation. The city pretended at it, coy with the lamps, easy with the sweep of brooms, but the breath under the floorboards had that hitch again, the one Jonas would have called a bad habit and taught the wall to forget. I let the morning wash me to the seams, kept the ash where it had chosen to take me, and ate the last of the bread my mother had refused to call cake. The bowl held its hum even when nobody stood inside it to deserve its attention, which meant it had learned Jonas as a kind of grammar. I put my ear to the table and counted until the count made sense. When I stood, the wood let me go without complaint, which is as close to approval as furniture gives people like me.

The Seamstress Guild lives in a corridor that smells like spine and starch. They keep their needles in little books like psalters, and the books are wrapped in cloth prettier than any shirt I have ever owned. Kyo came with me as far as the first bead curtain and then leaned on the wall like a backbone someone had carved outside a body and told to guard the door. Tamsin took the bead curtain like a flurry of rain. Clove found a place by a barrel of buttons and looked as if he had never stolen anything in his life; boys like him survive by lying to furniture and making it believe them.

Guildmistress Narel wore her hair in a crown of pins, every one with a head like a star. She had the sort of face that looks like a seam ironed wrong on purpose to warn the cloth about honesty. Her hands had pricked themselves into maps decades ago; the blood under her skin had learned not to make a fuss of it. She looked at my badge and then at the ash and then at my mouth and, in a miracle I should have lit a candle for, she chose to talk to my mouth. "Chief Vale," she said, and if she had been a mason she would have built walls by speaking to them. "You are late. We laid a shroud at dawn. If you had come sooner, you might have asked it a question before it forgot the shape of the body it was meant for."

"I don't talk to cloth unless someone I love is inside it," I said. "Your woman upstairs—mid-forties, hands that remember braiding hair and binding pages—she wore her work tags. The gold in her collar was wedding-grade thread. Somebody took a single stitch out of something meant to be a promise and made it into a trophy. I need to know who bought gold last week who shouldn't have. And I need to know whether anyone in this room believes that lemons make a woman luckier with knots."

Narel's mouth did not soften because she doesn’t believe in soft. She lifted a ledger so heavy it had already broken two tables in its life and spread it on the only third one in the room that would hold it. Pins chimed in her hair. "Wedding-grade," she said. "We buy that from Over-Still, not because I like their politics but because they're the only ones who twist the filaments with the patience to keep the stitch from sulking later. I bought five hanks three months ago and one two weeks ago when a Ward Two bride decided to make a sash for the old woman who raised her and asked me to pretend that wasn't a wedding if it helped with the price. The last lot went in pieces. Two to Menders' Alley for hymnal repairs because Ward Eight's books have learned the properties of steam. One to a hat man with more pride than wool. One to the Chancellor's Office for a ceremonial braid to hang on a railing he will stand behind for five minutes and forget. One to a gentleman from the Archive Trust who said the braid was for a display about ancient fabrics and spoke about thread the way hungry men talk about soup."

"The gentleman," I said, tasting the oil on his coat without needing to sniff it here. "Soft coat. Likes his shirts to pretend they are rivers. Hair sticky with something that thinks it understands linden. Name?"

She lifted one eyebrow just enough to tell me she noticed how carefully I didn't make it a demand. "He signed Avar Pell and paid in a form of money that makes floorboards jealous. He had hands that looked like he had never argued with a dish. He has a way of watching ledgers with pity for the numbers that can't add themselves. He called me mistress three times like it was an endearment. I don't let men call me endearments in my own room unless they are carrying a child and he's the father's father. He mentioned citrus because he had been in a piece-work room and I had boiled peels to keep the moths out of the threads. The moths like bitterness. The men like it better. Are we done with the part where I pretend to be impressed with your patience?"

"The citrus isn't yours, then," Tamsin said, touching the ledger with her finger as if to ease its suffering. "They've been oiling copper with orange. The ear Mark—do you know it?"

"A guild of listeners used to use it," Narel said, and for a moment her voice went small with an old secret. "Back when we still had organs, and pipes, and rooms that made sense only when you learned to put your ear at a seam and hear which wall carried which tone. There was a man called an auricular who married a woman who could tell a good seam from a bad by pinching it with her eyes. They adopted three boys and a girl and taught them to hum metal into kindness. They are all dead now. The ear remains because it is a pity to throw away a good mark. We use it when we make listening panels for the Houses for the newborns. You know. So that when their fathers learn to sing, the walls won't resent the babies for crying."

"Your woman," I said, because we had to put her back in the room by making her sound sit on the table. "Her name."

"Teala Wen," Narel said, and if the name tore her she didn't let it show. "She could catch a hem in a breath. She made collars for men's shirts so soft they felt like apologies. She hated lemons. She could not stand the way the smell got inside her teeth. If you found citrus on her, it wasn't because she was cooking. It was because someone pushed her into a place where fruit pretended to be a tool."

"How did she come by a gold stitch in a hat that was mostly a bad brim?" I asked. "And whose hat was it?"

Narel's pins chimed again, disapproving of hats. "She mended a thing a man loved because he no longer loved his face and thought hats would teach his mirror to be kinder. When his head burned, she kept the hat for him in a cupboard because he asked her to watch it the way some men ask their friends to keep a knife and a name. She made one gold stitch in it as a joke and a blessing. She was like that. Enough to make the object forgive its owner. The man came for it two nights ago and found it gone. He thought he'd misplaced it and apologized to the cupboard. Men apologize to cupboards too often in this city. Do you intend to catch the person who took a woman's joke and turned it into a flag for cruelty?"

"Yes," I said, the word heavy, not pretty. "And I intend to make him explain ears to people who don't want to learn, which is a worse task than prison. Who else did Pell touch when he was here?"

"Teala Wen," she said. "He asked her whether she had hands steady enough to stitch through silk without puckering it. She told him silk puckers from the soul. He laughed because men like him think they have discovered metaphor. He looked at the way she bound the back of a collar to make it forgive a man's neck and asked her where in the city those seams live in stone. She told him to go to a mason. He told her to come to a party."

Tamsin looked at me across the ledger and had the decency not to make a joke with the word party in it. "He is recruiting skills," she said, turning one of the pages so carefully the paper forgave her for being a cop. "He is making a garment out of professions and thinks it will fit him. We should set fire to it while he has it on."

"Later," I said. "We'll start with making him choose a new tailor. Does the Trust have an office left worth calling an office?"

Narel smiled in a way that should have made a man confess where he had put the sugar. "They keep their papers behind glass in a room that used to be a reading room. They run ropes across the floor where books used to stack themselves like stubborn animals and they take the ropes down when they think they are alone and dance. I know because we make their banners when they have little ceremonies. We sew pieces of old maps onto silk so their patrons can pretend they are walking the world with their hands. They hang an ear in the corner where the acoustics are bad because they think it's funny. If you know how to make laughter go quiet in a room like that, I'd like to come watch."

"I do," I said. "But I'm not selling tickets. Teala's shroud?"

Narel tightened both hands on the ledger, made the pages bleat a little, and then let go. "We don't own her," she said. "We wrapped her with the piece she was working on because work loves a body even when a body can't love it back anymore. We'll keep the pins laid until you speak to her husband. He makes ropes. If you put him in a room with your soft-coat, one of them will go quiet and for once I don't think I'd mind if it were the wrong one."

We left the Guild with a sliver of gold thread that Narel cut off with her teeth and pressed into my palm. "For luck," she said, and we both pretended nothing in our city is luck. Kyo had adopted a spool of coarse twine in the time we had been gone and was teaching it to forget it wished to tangle. He fell in beside me like gravity had learned manners.

"I don't like the name Avar," he said, because Kyo dislikes words that think they know where to sit at the table. "It sounds like a pocket taught to swallow. I will run his path through two screens and a room that hates him and bring you a list of knives you can use on him, morally and otherwise."

"Bring me his shoes," Tamsin said. "I can tell a man by his boots. Men's boots will lie when they are new and then tell the truth when they dry. If he has never gotten them wet, he will be easier to hurt."

"After lunch," I said, because no conspiracy should keep a body from food in my precinct. "I want to look at pipes. I want to watch a man who thought patience was a sin practice it until his teeth stop resenting him. I want to see whether the walls like him better than I do."

Ryhden hated the heatdrains on sight. The drains are humble rooms. They smell of iron and people's good intentions. There is steam where steam should not be, and the pipes admit with a little shame that they leak around their rivets in cold weather. Ness had set him at a bend where three sizes of pipe met like sisters forced to share a stool. He gave him a cloth and a song. Kyo leant his shoulder nearby and kept his hinge from being bored by teaching it to eavesdrop.

"It will itch," Ness told Ryhden, not unkindly. "It will itch because the muscles in your jaw have been trained to argue about righteousness and I am asking them to argue about pitch. Stop telling me you are not a singer. Everyone in this city is a singer now. Even the women who hate to hum in front of boys can wake a pipe if asked. Put your mouth near the bend and make the long note. If the pipe feels superior to you, it will snub you. You want it to be too polite to do that. Do you know how to make iron polite?"

"No," Ryhden said, and he didn't bother to dig for a metaphor. He put his mouth to the bend like a man offered an apple at a funeral, and he hummed, and the first sound he made had that edge that makes rooms want to argue. He flinched and almost bit himself for the itch. Ness kept the cloth there, steady as a hand on a child's back held over a railing you don't trust. Kyo's hum slid in underneath without making a pose of it. I put my knuckles to the pipe because hands are the part of me the city believes first. Tamsin stood in the door and tapped her foot on three and seven. The pipe pretended it didn't notice and softened a little instead.

"It is obscene to do this work," Ryhden said after a while, because men who like conditions need to name their discomforts. Sweat made a mustard of his face. The lemon on the railings of the terrace had left a ghost in his clothes he had not yet decided to wash. "It feels like flirting with something that can kill my mother."

"Do it right and the thing you flirt with will tell your mother where it has put its knife," Ness said. "You want a confession. You get one by being attentive, not by being pretty. Again."

Ryhden did it again, and this time he didn't try to sugar the sound. The pipe with the elbow that hated elbows sighed and decided to forgive us for having hands. He frowned at his own jaw when the itch turned to a small ache and a smaller sweetness. "I don't like that it feels good when it stops hurting," he said. "I will become someone I dislike if I let this sort of reward into my day."

"Most of us are someone we dislike half the time," I said. "We have an ear drawn on the archive terrace. Avar Pell can make ropes into music in his head and then strum them wrong in rooms we live in. If you decide to go back to him, at least decide with your jaw loose and not clenched so hard you forget your own name."

He closed his eyes and chose to obey. I saw the moment he did not swallow the opinion sitting under his tongue and let his tongue rest instead. The pipe made a sound like a dog consenting to have its paws washed. Kyo gave the hinge a break by walking away and letting himself be a whole man for the eight steps it takes to go from one pipe to another. Tamsin smirked and bought herself penance later with an extra hour at the ward door.

The Trust's reading room had been a church for books once and had not forgiven the men who wore soft coats for stealing its altars. The glass cases are broad-shouldered and anxious, like men who suspect they are less useful than the benches in the hallway and perform even more earnestness to compensate. Little placards tell you lies in the kind careful font that was invented to keep people from noticing there are no windows. The ear hung in a corner where the acoustics are bad and I felt a strong desire to teach it the old hymn and then erase it with spit.

Avar Pell met me at the door as if his mouth had known to be ready for mine at that distance. He wore a coat that wanted to be stroked and a look that wanted jewels. He had the sort of posture that makes a room decide that doors are theater. "Chief Vale," he said, and even his vowels believed they could inherit something. "I had hoped to meet you yesterday, but one must respect a widow's day. My condolences on your—on the city's loss."

"Jonas Vale was not my husband," I said, sparing him the indulgence of imagining himself a ruder man than he is. "Your condolences are late and dressed in the wrong clothes, but they will do. You bought gold thread, Mr. Pell. You used an ear. You pressed a stage. You murdered a woman who could have taught you how to sew your own pockets shut. I'm here to ask if you intend to keep the pattern."

He looked hurt the way rich men do when the thing they wanted to keep secret in their face gets invited to sit in a chair. "You have a genius for making a plan sound inelegant," he said. "We intend to help the city stop living like a creature hiding under a table. We intend to accept that we are at the bottom, not the top, and build for it. Collapse is not a cradle if we step back the first time it rocks. Collapse is the sea returning by a door we can hold open rather than being a flood that chooses its own entrance and laughs while doing it. As for the woman—sad, regrettable. There are costs. I am not the one who thinks otherwise; you are, and you have the luxury to think so because the men in your ward sing well enough not to undo you when they are happy."

"You killed her with a boy's halo," I said. "You smelled of orange because you wanted to keep the copper clean. You drew a mark you think you own and forgot that marks outlive men and choose their own masters. You want to open the south. I'll help you. I'll cut a seam. I will do it without turning half of Five into a bath. We have patience. You have pride. Pride collapses faster than stone."

He walked me between his cases like a man introducing me to a menagerie. There were maps of coastlines that used to exist and shells so old they'd begun to remember their ancestors. He had a glass bowl with salt in it and a sign that told people that this, here, was what they lacked. He thought metaphors were obedient. "Dareth will send you a commission to chair," he said. "He told me so this morning. He will give you the Southwater. He prefers to have critics inside the carriage if he cannot throw them under the wheel. Take it. You'll get my men. You'll get my money. You'll get what you say you want and then you will learn what you can have. You could be a woman history forgives, Chief Vale. It is an indecent offer. It is also the only one you will get without blood in its envelope."

"You sent men to play harp with copper and grief," I said. "One of them is at our pipes humming until his jaw turns into a new kind of muscle. If he comes back to you, you'll know where I keep my mercy. If you try to play the stage again, I will put your buttons in a jar and sell them for lemons."

Pell laughed then, honestly, annoyingly, which is to say he knew that courage and cowardice sit next to each other at most tables. "Ah," he said. "The buttons. He told you. Pleasant, to be told you are watched by taste. The ear in the corner offends you; we will move it. The lemon offends you; we will call it perfume. We both know none of that will matter when the river tires of our games and decides to knock anyway."

"I was taught to knock back," I said. "And to keep knocking until the door learns the shape of my hand. I'm done with your cases."

He gave me the smallest bow a coat can manage without wrinkling. He has not yet learned to ask permission of the rooms he stands in. He will. The reading room breathed a little easier when I left, because rooms do that when you bring ash in and set it down carefully and don't make them swallow it like medicine.

The boy who had found the stage's ear with his heel went missing again just after noon. Tamsin found the chalk on a stair and a ribbon sliver in a notch and did not break the stair in half only because she was too tired to be dramatic. My mother came to the House on that same breath, coil in her pocket, and told me she had heard a voice that was not Jonas in the bowl; not a man, not a child, but a whisper the stone had caught when somebody lay their hand down in fear. She said the whisper tasted of oranges. The old baptistry had given up the habit of being ashamed and learned to be a door again.

We ran south like we had been pulled by a rope tied around our ribs. The Ear Cathedral sits in the crook where the lime kilns' ancestor rooms kept their secrets. It is a whispering gallery masquerading as humility. The ceiling curves toward itself, and two men standing at opposite ends can tell one another what they ought to have done yesterday without anybody in the middle knowing why their sins have become weather. They had strung their harp finer here, copper to copper, ring to ring, and they had brought the boy to stand where the whisper warms. Clove is a child and growing into something worse and better. He looked at me and made himself still because he has learned that movement is admission even when you have committed no crime.

Pell stood on the floor and made a shape with his hands as if he could catch a chord like a net. Ryhden's partner—the one with the broth eyes—had the knot back in order and a new bite in his cheek from when patience had pretended to be virtue. Ness had not gotten there first because the heatdrains have their own ways to tell time and an hour does not necessarily arrive at the same minute in every room.

I could have called. I could have shot. I could have walked in and told an old room to go still around them and it would have, because in rooms that remember listening, orders prefer to arrive in the form of melody. Instead I put my hand on the wall and the wall told me where to stand. It gave me a place to put Kyo that was not a hinge for once and a place to place Tamsin's stone and a place to tell Ryhden to go if he intended to keep any of the dignity he was pretending to disdain. Clove watched my hands the way a cat watches a person who is about to open a can.

"You can keep the silver you stole," I said, because the first sentence you say in a whispering room should be a lie and an offer at once so the room understands you intend to be polite. "You cannot keep the boy. Give him and the rings and the knot and the coat and the ear. Keep the rest of your songs and take them where they do not drown our soup."

Pell smiled and it looked good on him until you realized it was not his. "You have practice saying 'give him' in rooms like this," he said. "I will give you everything except the idea. That I will persuade from you, and you will sleep better for the theft."

"Clove," I said, because boys like him forget their names in expensive rooms. "Pretend to drop your sandwich. When the man steps back because he has never had a stain touch his boot, you run where the wall pushes, not where your legs think they should. The wall loves you more than your legs do."

He did it. He let his lunch be gravity's business and Pell danced back with a disgusted little intake that made me pity him even while I entertained murder, and the knot-man reached and Kyo caught his wrist because we have practiced that in every room since we learned to be enemies and the wall took Clove like a current and every copper line in that room coughed the wrong note because the boy the wrong note had been built for had not consented to carry it. Tamsin tilted her stone to catch the cough. Ryhden stepped into his own old shadow and then stepped out again because there are men who have never practiced leaving a side and deserve applause when they try it. Pell flung his hand like a man scattering water and the ear painted on the pillar behind him lit as if lemon oil had a soul.

"Listen," he said, and that was the mistake. The room did. It did not like what it heard. Listen is a word that rooms shaped like shells consider sacred. He used it like a rope. The sound he asked for came back wrong, because rooms like this refuse to be made into cleverness by people who have not paid their rent to their own ceilings.

I stepped into the place the wall had given me for heroics and tried not to disgrace it. I sang the keep-note without making a poem of it. Jonas rode up the seam of the wall as if it had been waiting to tell him a story and the story had just gotten to the part with the good knife. Ness arrived with three men and a long pole and a wet cloth he threw like an old god hurling lightning, only humbler. Kyo pivoted and pulled and the knot-man fell into his hinge without breaking his dignity, which is to say Kyo let him keep a little skin. Tamsin took the ear with a rag and lemon and salt and made it petty. Pell's mouth did the thing men do when they find a room has decided not to be their accomplice. He bowed once, as if to an audience, which is the wrong person to bow to in a whispering room, and left by a door that had decided to forgive him for now because doors are generous when you are not as important as you think.

Clove stood with his hands on his knees, panting, sandwich amalgamated with dust in his fist, and lifted his head to look at me like the boy who keeps the first month of you. "Did I do the stages?" he asked, because I had taught him stages earlier to keep him from choosing two at once and breaking his own bones. "Drop. Wait. Run. Look. Listen. Don't die. Boss?"

"You forgot breathe," I said, and the laugh that lit the room was not just mine. The whispering gallery offered us back our own chuckle with a little garnish of older mirth, the sort that refuses to be tired of us even when we are fools. "Add it between look and listen next time."

We took the harp down the way we would have dismantled a trap we hadn't realized we had set for ourselves. We wrapped the rings and marked the rope and rubbed the posts with lemon until the ear sulked and went out. Ryhden stood watching me not watch him, and when Kyo handed him a wet cloth he took it this time without pretending the cloth had cells of poison in it. He rubbed the chalk off the pillar and when his fingers smeared the paint he did not pretend he had not. Ness taught the room to accept the wrong note and spit it later when no one would be hurt by it. Tamsin's recorder stone loved the gallery with a kind of lust that made her laugh and scold it in the same breath.

Behind the pillar with the painted ear was a curve of wall the masons had once used to test a seam. They carve a small cut and hum into it and listen for the way the stone tells them whether it wants to be a door when it grows up. Someone had scratched near that cut with a needle, so small you had to ask the wall to help you see it. It was gold thread in reverse—metal turned to a hair. Teala Wen had been there. She had been in the gallery to mend a rope or admire an echo or because a man had told her there was something beautiful underneath and she had believed him because she believed in objects and the dignity of things. She had scratched with her work pin because she had run out of other ways to talk to a room that had been told to listen only to men.

It read like a seamstress writes when she doesn't want to be read and someone else should find it anyway. R S S E, crooked, faint, the S's reversed. Ryhden frowned. Tamsin made a noise that would have gotten her hit in a church, in the old days, and said "South-south-east," and then apologized to the wall for shouting because walls deserve courtesy. The cut in the stone bore the burr of a ship's name even though it had never met a ship. The city wanted a compass, and Teala had given it one. She had kept sewing into death.

When we went up again the ceiling was chalk-blue and had grown a new comet tail, which meant some child had decided we were not done with the part of living where we imagine we get to draw directional lines across the roof of our own sky. I put the gold sliver from Narel next to the scraped letters and the room did that thing where it praises you by not dropping dust in your mouth. We had south-south-east, and an archive that thought it was a sea, and a man whose buttons wanted new management, and a boy who had not died because half a sandwich had decided pride could take a coach to somewhere else.

The Chancellor's summons came folded like a bird taught to behave inside a cage. He asked me to chair his commission with a letter that called me brave and steady and the city's friend. He told me there would be funds for "careful restructuring of southern corridors to accommodate humidity and flow," which is how men like him say drown without admitting there is water. He attached a list of names, and Avar Pell's was there, and Ness's was not, and Jonas's appeared in the place reserved for those we pretend will be with us in spirit. He asked that I bring any recorder stones we wished to "accredit" and promised a seat near the front for my "respected mother." He ended with a sentence he must have enjoyed writing: "Let us open our ears to the future."

I put the letter on the table between my hands and left it there like a dead sparrow. My mother took her coil out of the porcelain and set it next to it. Jonas hummed under the furniture like a river being told to accept a bridge. Kyo leaned his shoulder into my door and the lintel got the benefit of his grief. Tamsin played the bad note back from the recorder in a whisper we could step over and not break our shins. Clove ate half a sandwich he had rescued from his pocket and looked like a cat that had learned charity by mistake. Ryhden was not in the room; he was listening to a pipe and trying to persuade it that patience isn't a sin if you hide the pleasure carefully.

"We're going south-south-east," I said, and the note Jonas laid under my sentence made my skin follow suit. "We are going to peel the ear off every pillar between the trust and the kelp rooms. We are going to teach the Archive a hymn. We will take the commission. We will break it. We will use it until it can no longer be called his. We will cut seams with other people's knives if that's what we must. We will not let the cradle swing. We will not let the bowl boil. We will open our ears to the future and then tell it to speak softer and wait its turn."

"You should bring a coat with less pride," my mother said, because she has never learned to let a speech end without a small practical cruelty to keep it modest. "And you should tie your hair like a woman who knows she is going to run. There will be lemons at the Trust because they like to be clean in places that attract dust. Bring salt. Use it where they will feel it later and not know why their lips are cracked."

"Yes," I said, because there are only so many times in a day you can argue with a woman who has learned to steam lemon peels and donate their scent to a city's safety. "Kyo, pick your walls. Tamsin, take two stones and find how a library resents a rope. Clove, if you step where I don't, I will take your sandwich away and make you watch me feed it to Ness. Mother, leave the coil; bring your mug; be ready to hit someone with it when they deserve to drink from it and cannot. Jonas, if you can hear me, hum when the stones forget their part."

We went with salt in a pocket where letters might have lived once and lemons in a bag with the recorder stones because piety uses the same containers as mischief. The corridor to south-south-east sloped with an old ceremony; you could tell once there had been a procession that took this path, and the walls had learned to curve a little to accommodate the weight of sorrow carried decently. The air had that complicated smell of limestone rooms that have been told to accept water when they were born dry. Ears marked the pillars, discreet, proud, wrong; we rubbed them out one by one with salt and laughter that we had no right to and took anyway because if the enemy insists on being ridiculous it is perverse not to be happy about it.

At the last turn before the old kelp vats, Jonas's voice went thin and a little higher, as if the ceiling had whispered back and he had leaned in to hear. There was a cut in the wall the size of a child's palm and it had a rag stuffed into it that had once been part of a dress. It smelled of lemon and ash both. Tamsin took it out with two fingers and the wall sighed in relief. On the other side there was a shaft, narrow and full of a sound like a street when you are under it. When I put my hand over it the air rose cooler, not without kindness, and there was a sound from far below that might have been the sea and might have been notebooks being burned in a room where men remembered too late they had learned better.

"South-south-east," Kyo said, leaning over my shoulder with all the caution he saves for doorways. "The kelp vats used to be stirred by a paddle wheel fed by a slot like this. If you make them sing wrong, they slap their paddles into neighbors and the whole floor begins to slosh. If you were an idiot with a coat and a dream, you would lower a harp here and name the slap a tide."

"Then we cut the strings," I said, and set the salt where the rope would have wanted to find its purchase. Tamsin rubbed the lip with lemon until it sulked itself honest. Clove wedged himself into a place where only boys fit and held onto the edge of the shaft without flinching because children do not appreciate death the way adults do; they have not yet been taught to feel offended by its impoliteness.

A voice came up then, not Jonas, not a man we knew, and not a woman we had gotten the chance to befriend. It was Teala Wen's last breath, caught in the limestone, stored like a miser's coin behind plaster, waiting for the right ear. She said the word we had already learned to write on pillars and in ledgers, only she said it like a curse and a blessing together. Listen, she said, and the shaft carried it back to us, soft, obedient, furious, merciful. We did. We will. We went, all of us, and so did the city, because we have learned to move as one when the right woman tells us to, even if all we are carrying is salt and lemons and stones that think they are dogs.
