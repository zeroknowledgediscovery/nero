     "novel_text": "The harbor water wore the color of bruises that night, a slow violet throb under a sky full of sodium bulbs and smudged stars. Wind came up Off Pratt Street and found the cracks in everything. It found the seam in the old jacket and the knot in her shoulder and the mismatched window upstairs that whined whenever a bus took the corner hard. It found Mr O\u2019Brian, who sat on the marble steps of a rowhouse and held both hands around a paper cup gone soft with coffee and rain. She watched the hospital on the hill breathe in light and breathe out light, the way living things do when you look long enough.\n\nThere was a hum in the city if you knew to listen, and she had learned to listen. It ran under the streetcar rails that no longer carried streetcars. It spoke in the water-pipes, in the valves that did not fully seal, in the neon that crackled, on-off-on, all night. It ended in people. It ended in the very specific tremble of a woman waiting for her son to come out of surgery, in the staccato of a surgeon\u2019s hands that did not tremble until they did. The Force\u2014no, just call it the current; the Force belonged to the stories she had stolen and repurposed\u2014ran through those moments like threading a needle through a dress that might or might not fit. Mr O\u2019Brian could place two fingers on the stone leading up to the house and feel the city like a pulse.\n\n\u201cCold,\u201d she said to no one, and steam wrote her word into the air and tore it to bits.\n\nDown the block a bar named the Scupper opened its door, breathed out a rope of music and laughter and overcooked wings, and then clapped shut again. She didn\u2019t go in. She had a glass sword in a canvas bag and a silvery disc with a crack across it like a smile, and she had a list of names folded into a wallet that had once been leather and was now mostly prayer. She felt the current twitch.\n\nQuinn.\n\nThe name didn\u2019t like saying itself. It left the tongue reluctantly, as if halfway across a busy road with a truck coming. Quinn. The shape of him was indecency and winter air; the absence of him was a door that had closed behind you too quietly to notice, and only later did you find yourself in a different room than you thought you were in. He moved where doctors moved. He was fueled by it\u2014rejection, the kind that becomes oxygen, the negative of oxygen. He was the kind that learned every corridor map of every hospital he stalked, studied shifts, learned faces as if faces were combinations. He had a freezer, O\u2019Brian knew. That was not a metaphor.\n\nShe stood because she couldn\u2019t stand not standing any longer. The coffee slid into the trash can with a sound like something small admitting failure. A city bus yawed toward the hospital and she kept pace along the sidewalk, let it break the wind for her. Snowflakes came out of nothing to test the air and then thought better of it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t always walk in. Sometimes she stood across the street and read the hospital like a text, line by line, window by window: oncology got the south light, ER got the noise, cardiology hummed louder in the morning when caffeine caught up. Tonight she went in. Automatic doors made a sound like thin hands rubbing together. The lobby smelled like bubblegum hand soap and those towers of paper brochures that no one takes until they really need to. A flock of inhabitants in blue and green moved past her in various states of heat and urgency. She could tell which nurse was on an hour thirteen by the way she held her shoulders. She could tell which security guard had spent the afternoon arguing with his brother by the way he looked through people rather than at them.\n\nThere was a woman behind the desk with a braided bun and calm eyes. The tag said ALINA in plain block letters as if to say, I will be as simple as I can afford to be.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d O\u2019Brian said.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d Alina said, and now there was a smell of winter on her coat too. \u201cVisiting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Dr. Patel. He\u2019s on tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been on far too many nights this week,\u201d Alina said, and then, \u201cDo you have an appointment, hon?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll want to see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will, huh?\u201d The hardness under the calm; the test in soft colors. \u201cI\u2019ll page.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him O\u2019Brian,\u201d she said, and then, because it was Baltimore, \u201cMr O\u2019Brian.\u201d\n\nAlina\u2019s eyebrow tilted upward in a way that dared her to explain why she had said it like that, and then lowered again. \u201cPlease have a seat. It might be a minute.\u201d\n\nSeats in hospital lobbies were the kind of chairs that made you feel you were doing the wrong thing by sitting in them too long. O\u2019Brian stood by the aquarium instead. The fish moved like thoughts: purposeful, repetitive, decorative.\n\nA full minute later, and then another, Dr. Patel appeared like a man late to his own life. He smelled faintly of whatever it is a person smells like when they have scrubbed and scrubbed and the day still clings to them. He had a face like a good coin worn by handling. \u201cMr O\u2019Brian,\u201d he said, then looked around as if he had expected a different face attached to that sound, then saw her and remembered.\n\n\u201cDev,\u201d she said, and something like affection won a short, irrelevant argument in her expression.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a ghost, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou appear when I am too tired to be civil, ask questions I am unlikely to answer, and disappear before the cafeteria closes. It\u2019s very rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought you a sandwich last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stole half of it, then told me it\u2019s important to practice sharing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou looked happier with less to chew.\u201d\n\nHe smiled because he did that as a matter of principle, even when it made him later for something. \u201cWhat now? I have three patients prepped and one family about to ask me if I can guarantee anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cYou knew Dr. Clare Harrow.\u201d\n\nStillness. Not too long. Then he nodded once. \u201cI\u2026 yes. Clare was a resident here. Pediatrics. Bright. Sharp edges in the right places. She\u2026 moved departments.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t move. She disappeared.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not helpful for me, O\u2019Brian.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe walked out after her shift two weeks ago and didn\u2019t walk in again. Her phone pinged off a tower near the waterfront and then stopped. She had no reason. She had every reason.\u201d She moved closer so the sentence belonged to fewer ears. \u201cQuinn.\u201d\n\nDev\u2019s mouth made a shape as if he understood the sound but not the sentence. He placed two fingers against the bridge of his nose in the universal gesture for I\u2019m too tired to have this conversation but not tired enough to forget it later.\n\n\u201cYou keep saying that,\u201d he said. \u201cAs if a word is evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cA name can be a hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are bad nights, there are worse. Sometimes someone leaves. Sometimes they leave and they come back. Sometimes they don\u2019t and it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not because of a story you are telling yourself to make sense of your own nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cDev,\u201d she said, and the current rose in her like a cough, \u201che keeps things. He keeps what he thinks he deserves, because they refused him. Not money. Not time. Sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me this to do what? Make me look behind every freezer door I see? I\u2019m a doctor. Freezers do not frighten me. Stories do not save me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat saves you then?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall, statistical improvements,\u201d he said, and the smile tried again. He had his hand on the pager at his hip. \u201cO\u2019Brian, I mean it. If you keep coming into my work with your\u2026 Jedi aura and your contradictions, I\u2019ll stop taking your calls.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never took my calls,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stop returning them, then.\u201d\n\nThey stood looking at each other for long enough that Alina raised her eyes twice from her paperwork to judge the degree of the stare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you names,\u201d O\u2019Brian said at last. \u201cDoctors missing. Two in Boston. One in Philly. Three who left notes so quiet you\u2019d call them drafts.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Dev said, but his voice wasn\u2019t a no, it was an I will but later.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell your detective friend,\u201d he added. \u201cI like to keep my life not only civil but also unharassed.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to ask anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake her ask you,\u201d he said, and let the pager lead him back to whatever waited past the lobby.\n\nOutside the air had found new teeth. The night bit a little harder. O\u2019Brian set her palm against the hospital\u2019s skin\u2014brick, stone, glass\u2014and waited until the current settled and then told her what it liked to tell her in the voice of an argument she\u2019d had with herself too often: He is not here. She believed it. Qu\u2014 she didn\u2019t say the name. She saved names for when they had more than one witness.\n\nOn Eager Street the deli still had lights on and a card taped to the window that read WE ARE CLOSING WHEN WE CLOSE. There was a wooden angel in the window too, the kind that held a harp and looked as if it could be talked into a sin. O\u2019Brian waved at the owner, declined a sandwich without being asked, went up the stairs to the room she rented by the week because the landlord liked to be reminded of rent by cash and faces. The landing sighed. The door took her key with a grudge.\n\nHer place was three chairs and a bed and a table that didn\u2019t have enough one-liners left in it to pose as a desk. There was a bowl beside the door where she put things that she wanted to find in a hurry: keys, a crumpled ticket from an aquarium she had gone to without anyone, a wrench she had borrowed and planned to return late enough to be forgiven. The canvas bag went on the bed. She drew the sword out and held it like she always did, with her palms open, as if it had its own in-progress decision to make about staying a myth. The lights went down, and the blade came up, a line of light the color of a promise you think someone might keep. It purred. It had a sound like speaking under your breath when you didn\u2019t want everyone to hear. She knew how to hold it because she had taught herself in a classroom of air and imagination and because she had spent too much time alone.\n\nShe turned it off because keeping it on was a waste and someone downstairs would complain about the noise or the way it made their spoons vibrate. She lay back on the bed with her hands under her head and watched the ceiling flake. There were cracks like maps. She traced them to no conclusion. Sleep took its time and then arrived sudden as a door slamming.\n\nShe woke to the sound of the freezer, and for a full two seconds, precisely two, she did not know if the sound lived in the room or in her. It was the old fridge, of course. The half-sized beast the landlord had shoved in a corner, its door held true by a magnet shaped like a crab. It hummed and hiccuped and once in a while sighed in a way that meant nothing. She lay there and watched the ceiling accept this answer and felt the current tell her, again, he isn\u2019t here. She had to stop him even when he wasn\u2019t here. She had to stop him, and the grammar of that sentence sometimes didn\u2019t fit.\n\nIn the morning there were new names. A printed flyer in the coffee place: MISSING in heavy letters. A woman named Dr. Alvarado smiled from a photograph that made a promise photographs often make: she had a dog, someone loved her, she made dumplings on Sundays, she was supposed to have more time. The barista slightly burned the coffee. He apologized twice. He said, \u201cYou look like somebody who is about to tell me a story, and I have a rule about that: I say yes. Yes, but no names. Yes, but make it end better than it starts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen make it end like a joke,\u201d he said, surrendered the cup. \u201cEveryone deserves the mercy of a punchline before noon.\u201d\n\nShe went back to the hospital again that afternoon, because repetition was a kind of spell, because some doors open if you knock exactly the right number of times. In the ER the current shrieked and sang and argued with itself. A woman in a Ravens jersey held a towel to a little boy\u2019s forehead and explained loudly to the air that everything was going to be fine, not because she believed it, but because the air needed to hear. O\u2019Brian leaned on the counter with her elbows and let the currents pour through, and then Detective Mendez found her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re bad luck,\u201d Mendez said without preface. She had hair the color of a fact and eyes that meant to prosecute even birthdays. \u201cEvery time you show up, I lose a day off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m yoga for your schedule,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cI stretch it, make it pop.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about popping in an ER. What is it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctors,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cLeaving without saying goodbye. Leaving small notes that say everything they cannot say out loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctors work like they\u2019re being chased. Sometimes they run farther than they should. Sometimes they change names.\u201d Mendez shook her head, then jerked her chin toward the lobby. \u201cYou keep breathing my air like this and somebody is going to accuse me of taking advice from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cFor practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mendez said, softened it with a snort. \u201cTell me only what you know and nothing you feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know nine names in four cities. I know each had a colleague who could say with authority the word friend and mean it. I know each had a thing in common besides work: they told someone no. They cut something off. They refused a grant, or a relationship, or a visit. They said no.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone says no,\u201d Mendez said. \u201cEveryone also gets told no. It\u2019s the basic scaffolding of adulthood. It would be weird if these doctors had never used the word.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is someone who hoards it like fuel,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cSomeone who collects the heat of it and then uses that heat to power something worse.\u201d\n\nMendez looked at her as if she\u2019d just suggested the existence of a dragon in the basement. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the thing again. I can\u2019t write \u2018worse\u2019 on a form.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could. It would make good reading later. As a category.\u201d\n\nMendez said nothing. The wall-clock erased minutes with bureaucratic precision. A gurney kissed open a rear door and came in fast. \u201cGo home,\u201d Mendez said over her shoulder. \u201cEat something that isn\u2019t made by a machine. I\u2019ll call you if I find a Quinn in a file that smells like smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find him,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cHe\u2019s better at flinching than that. He\u2019s the shadow the motion sensor can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d Mendez said again, in a voice that had told other people worse things.\n\nShe went. But home was a place she carried around like a bruise, and if you pressed it the wrong way it told you old stories. She walked down to the waterfront and stood where the last of the light turned metal, and she turned her face to the wind as if it had come to apologize for something. She wrote the names on the inside of her head in order: Harrow, Yi, Alvarado, Bishara, McClelland, Kay\u2026 and when she tried for the rest, the current folded in on itself and turned into a noise like a television left on in an empty room.\n\nQuinn worked nights too. He was a figure you saw as glass makes a pass by light and shows you a stranger in your own reflection. O\u2019Brian had seen him three times and would have sworn to each. She had watched him pause outside Mercy, once. She had watched him slip between two parked cars and vanish like he had stepped sideways into a thinner sort of air. He had. He\u2019d learned to use edge spaces. He\u2019d learned the geometry of neglect. How many cameras point at a loading dock? Enough to give the ambitious a chance. How many eyes, though, watch the world because they love it? Fewer. He took the difference.\n\nAt night when she did sleep, the dreams came like messages written on fogged glass. She would be in a room that had no corners. She would be in a freezer aisle of a supermarket that had abandoned its branding. She would open a door and there would be jars labeled not with names but with a notation that meant both possession and prayer. She would wake and the hum of her own refrigerator would be gentle and stupid, and she would hate it for its ordinary patience.\n\nShe saw Dev again on a Tuesday that felt like a Thursday, which made sense because nothing else did. He looked at her and said, instead of hello, \u201cI got an email from Clare three days after she went missing.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t move. Sometimes the current had to hold still to listen. \u201cWhat did it say.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t look anymore. I\u2019m going to go somewhere colder.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cCold is quiet for some people,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cCold is the room you go to when your voice hurts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was scheduled,\u201d he said. \u201cSet to send in three days. Or someone did that. And there\u2019s something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a letter in the mail. Paper. No envelope. It was folded into a flyer for a medical supply company. There was a single sentence in handwriting that did not look like Clare\u2019s. \u2018He keeps what he cannot see.\u2019 That is nothing, O\u2019Brian. That is a game. But I wanted to tell you because I am so hungry for the noise that explains the noise that I will eat anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone who knows what happened and wants to be punished for not stopping it. It\u2019s someone who thinks they can balance the scale by frightening you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it working?\u201d\n\nShe looked at him, and for a second she saw an old friend she had lost the right to claim. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe rubbed his hands together like he was cold. \u201cIf I give you a name, will you be careful with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am careful with names,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you trying to teach me to be kinder?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Dev said. \u201cHer girlfriend. Her name is Lena. If you scare her, I won\u2019t forgive you this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances next year,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and took the piece of paper he had written the address on like it was something alive.\n\nLena\u2019s apartment near Charles Village had plants that preferred her company to light and a couch that had taught itself to forgive a lot. Lena had hair that would have looked like carelessness if not for the precise way her fingers snagged in it when she was trying to interrupt a thought. She let O\u2019Brian in because Dev had called her first and said, \u201cShe is a good ghost.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t dead,\u201d Lena said with a breath that had waited to be an accusation for days.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say she was,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cI think she\u2019s in a room. I think she thinks someone closed the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a priest and a lunatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been called worse and softer things. I don\u2019t have a better language. I am working on it.\u201d\n\nLena\u2019s hands went to the plants and came away with soil under the nails. \u201cClare left her coat,\u201d she said. \u201cShe left her coat and she loved that coat. She left a list on the counter that had three items and two were crossed off. She left her favorite pen. She never leaves her favorite pen. I know how this sounds, like your letters. I know. I know. But those are the holes that let the cold in.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wore a new coat once,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cSomeone told her it made her look too tall and she laughed and said good. Has anyone come around?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo detectives who smelled like polite exhaustion and one of them asked me if Clare might have been depressed and I said if you asked me that again I will metaphorically call your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cMetaphorically,\u201d O\u2019Brian said.\n\n\u201cI am a good citizen,\u201d Lena said. \u201cThat is how we speak to authority in this house.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the name Quinn touch anything in here,\u201d O\u2019Brian said softly. \u201cIn the air, in your stomach, in the part of the wall that always looks like a face.\u201d\n\nLena flinched. She looked at the plants as if they had betrayed her by continuing to be green. \u201cClare had a patient last month. Quinn was the name on the file. Or maybe I am putting it there because you just did. No. No, I remember her saying it. \u2018Quinn is back again,\u2019 she said, as if it had been more than once. No last name. Pediatric psych consult. A boy who had written the word NO on his notebook eight pages straight. Twelve years old. Eyes the color of soda. Clare said he was beautiful like a thing that would be very dangerous to love.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot to love,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cDo you think she wrote to him. Do you think he followed her outside of work. Do you think I should stop asking questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lena said to the last one. \u201cBut if you can stop asking all the others by stopping something, do that.\u201d\n\nThe plant nearest the window tapped the glass twice as if to count.\n\nOutside, the weather remembered it had a job. Rain unrolled like a thin sheet over the city. The wind became an accomplice to nothing in particular. O\u2019Brian stood under a small overhang and did the kind of arithmetic that never added up and only sometimes soothed. Dr. Clare Harrow, whose laugh had left notches in the hallway. A boy named Quinn who wrote NO until the word had no sound. A pattern that might be a pattern because she needed it to be.\n\nThere were places in the city that weren\u2019t maps. Places you had to be told to find by someone who didn\u2019t like you enough to lie. One was a storage unit facility that had a fence too shiny and a clerk who didn\u2019t lift his eyes enough. People hid things in storage units because they wanted to believe in the eventual rescue. O\u2019Brian went there because the current tugged and because twice in the last three days she had followed Quinn past the shape of it in the rain. She bought a lock without saying she needed one. She walked the rows and let the numbers fail to matter.\n\nAt Unit 97 she stopped. It was nothing. It was exactly the kind of nothing that constitutes a shadow. O\u2019Brian placed her palm on the metal. Cold ran up her arm like a story she\u2019d heard before and then fallen asleep before the end. A light flicked above her with a sound like someone asking not to be added to a list. She stood with the key she didn\u2019t have and thought of thirteen ways to undo a simple lock, six of them illegal, three of them implausible, four of them requiring a friend she didn\u2019t have.\n\nBehind her a boy coughed. A real cough, not a rhetorical one. She turned, and he was twelve or near it, hair too long over his eyes, a T-shirt with a superhero whose name had been argued over by a thousand lawyers. He looked at her like you look at a car as it slides toward you on ice.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hang around here,\u201d he said, which is what a lot of people say when they mean please don\u2019t look at me.\n\n\u201cNeither should you,\u201d she said. \u201cIs your name Quinn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know my name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think you do. That\u2019s not the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make guesses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s how I don\u2019t fall asleep in the middle of a sentence.\u201d\n\nHe watched her sword bag as if it might bark. \u201cAre you a Jedi.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn good days I am,\u201d she said. \u201cOn bad days I am a person with a costume, which isn\u2019t the worst thing to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop what already happened,\u201d he said. It came out too formal, like something he\u2019d been taught and practiced.\n\n\u201cSometimes you can make its echo quieter,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have a freezer.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because it was such a stupid question, because it asked too much of him. \u201cWhy would I have a freezer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people keep more than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people think that if they keep things, they will stop time from taking everything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works,\u201d he said, but his voice slid down to say, I want it to be.\n\n\u201cDoes someone keep your eyes,\u201d she said.\n\nHis head came up fast. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, and mortified rage painted his cheekbones. \u201cNo. That\u2019s not what\u2026\u201d Then he saw her face and understood that she had asked something else, something that had nothing to do with anatomy and everything to do with the ability to look at the world and say, yes, I will let you in. He stepped backward and then forward. The rain made a pattern on his shirt. \u201cAre you going to tell,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI tell stories,\u201d she said. \u201cI only tell on people who have stopped telling their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone lies about monsters,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you can tell who tells the truth. The liar makes the monster look small enough to step on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the truth,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe truth says that if you see it,\u201d he said, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t come closer.\u201d\n\nHe went then, so fast that the current broke two fingers trying to catch him. She pressed her forehead against the metal door of Unit 97 and felt the old scar there where she had learned what happens when you think you can find your way in the dark without help.\n\nTwilight built its ugly apartments and moved in. The city changed keys. The deli downstairs closed late because the owner recognized a man\u2019s hunger and exchanged it for tomorrow\u2019s hunger. O\u2019Brian sat at the table-that-wanted-to-be-a-desk and placed the glass disc on it and the sword beside it and the names in front of her and said, \u201cI could be wrong.\u201d\n\nThe words were strange in her mouth. Not because she didn\u2019t say them often, but because this time they had teeth.\n\nThe letter from Lena had a photograph tucked in it, and in the photograph Clare held a paper cup and a dog tried to drink it and someone\u2014Lena\u2014had caught them both laughing. O\u2019Brian set it beside the names. She felt the hum again. The hum of her refrigerator, faithful and stupid and obstinately domestic. She stood. She opened the freezer.\n\nEmpty things can be loud. An empty box suffers. An empty shelf imagines bruises. The freezer was not empty. There were ice trays with a few thick blue wedges, a bag of peas as hard as a pillow of rocks, an index card she had left in there because she\u2019d read somewhere once that cold would erase the ink traces left by old letters. She had put it there to test the truth, and then forgotten the test. Her own handwriting lived on it anyway. The words were: Stop telling this story. The ink had not blurred.\n\nShe closed the door with the carefulness of an apology. She sat down. She placed her palms flat. She said, like a person reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer in a language no longer used by anyone she knew, \u201cYour job is to listen to the current and then tell me when I am lying.\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\nAnd then, a whisper, not from outside but from whatever in her had claimed to be older than her. The voice that held a measure. The voice that told her where to put the light so that shadow could show its edges.\n\nThe whisper said, He is in here.\n\nShe stood very still. Her reflection in the window did a good job of imitating her. She laid a hand against her chest like a witness. Of course he was in here. Not in the room. In the story. In the engine that made her wake up and pick up the sword and haunt hospitals and frighten friends and raid storage facilities she couldn\u2019t spell her way into if pressed. Quinn had been born of rejection. Whose rejection. He kept what others could not. What had she kept. On the card in the freezer she had obeyed herself for a second and then disobeyed.\n\nShe could tell a new story, tonight, if she wanted, about a woman on a rowhouse stoop and a hospital that breathed and a bar whose door opened when you didn\u2019t want it to and a detective who loved answers the way other people love sports and a doctor who smiled against his own better judgment and a boy who knew the names of monsters and a man\u2014no, not a man, a shape\u2014that moved in the negative space and collected sight because he could not stand being seen. She could tell this story until it was the only architecture holding the night up.\n\nShe got up and paced because pacing is what you do when you want to wear through a thought to see what is underneath. The blade in the bag hummed once as if something brushed its pelt. The disc on the table refracted the light into a shallow rainbow that broke and reunited whenever she moved her hand. In the hall someone\u2019s radio whispered a game. A neighbor laughed with too little comedy in her voice.\n\nShe tried to hold onto the boy\u2019s eyes without grabbing them. She tried to remember exactly how he had said you can\u2019t stop what already happened. She tried to sit inside that sentence and see if there was a window. There was. It was behind her. It looked into the alley. It showed her the reflection of the room, and in the reflection it showed her that something written on the wall in pencil had been erased so thoroughly that the skin of the paint shone.\n\nHer own handwriting again, a year older, three years older. She could see, when she squinted, the ghosts of letters. Q. U. I. N.\n\nShe closed her eyes. The Force\u2014no, the current\u2014moved through the city, found the hospital, found the boy, found Lena\u2019s plants, found Dev\u2019s empty hand on the counter, found Mendez leaning back in a chair until the chair said I\u2019m not built for this. It found O\u2019Brian, who sometimes forgot that names are contracts and contracts are cages and cages are comfortable in winter if you have learned to decorate them.\n\nOutside the rain lightened. The street breathed out. She did too. She wiped her hand across the window as if that would clear something. It didn\u2019t. She was going to stop him. She would say it and say it and say it until the sentence found its way into a room where it fit. She would stop him even if the room was only the inside of her skull, which had always been one of the rooms the city lets you rent. She would stop him, and that would be something, even if everything else still wore the difficult color of the harbor.\n\nThe night cracked just enough for morning to argue its case. It would be early yet when she took her sword and her cracked disc and went out again, to the hospital, to the bar, to the storage place that pretended to forget. There would be names with new letters. There would be the same fluorescent lights. There would be the hum\u2014her refrigerator, someone else\u2019s, the unit down the hall, the old transformer out back\u2014all of them singing the same stalemate hymn. There would be her. There would be Quinn, insistent as a story you tell to keep from sleeping. There would be the current. There would be the possibility, small as a fish in an aquarium trying not to make an exception of itself, that a thing you made in your mind could sit down with you and negotiate.\n\nShe lay down with her boots on and slept in bursts too short to be useful. In one of those bursts she opened the storage unit, and in the storage unit, neat rows of jars watched her without seeing. No. Not jars. She refused the picture. She made them stones. She made them marbles. She made them labels without contents, and when she woke she knew that the negotiation had begun, and that closing a door is sometimes the only way to find out if it was a door at all.Morning did not arrive so much as collect itself on the edges of things and wait for her to accept that it had courage enough to try again. She felt it as the way the hallway's bulb steadied, as the way the deli below her swapped out yesterday's coffee for today's, as the way the street out front admitted that even if the sky did not clear, it would proceed. She washed with water that bit at the face and drank coffee that remembered it had been someone else's first attempt and pulled on the jacket that had lost the argument with wind, and she took the canvas bag not like a burden but like a witness. The note she had rescued from the freezer she folded twice and then again until the paper became an object rather than a sentence, and she put it in the bowl by the door with the keys and the wrench as if what you leave behind blesses what you carry.\n\nThe deli owner looked at her as if she had slept on a bench his grandmother would have disapproved of and handed her a round roll cut crooked that held eggs with an opinion and bacon that made you forget its history. He did not ask for money, which meant he would ask later and call that interest. He said, not unkindly, that she looked like someone who had decided to wrestle something large that did not know it was a metaphor. She said she had added vegetables to her breakfast and was therefore already exceeding her capacity for virtue. He laughed and asked if she wanted a second napkin and then pressed two into her hand in case one had to be used for a reason that did not involve her mouth. She ate half on the walk because you should always let a thing get cold on its own terms.\n\nHer phone, the kind with hairline cracks that the case no longer pretended to control, hummed in her pocket with a message from Mendez that contained a time and an address and the words try not to narrate me. The address belonged to a smaller hospital, not the one on the hill with the long doors but the one with the sleepy tree in front that had lost three branches in last winter's storm and had not yet made up its mind about optimism. O\u2019Brian texted back a grocery list because sometimes you keep faith by irrelevance, then walked as if the sidewalks had been made to namedrop her shoes.\n\nThe ER at eight in the morning resembled a ferry terminal that had forgotten it meant to leave. People stood with the everyday catastrophes that circle a city: a plumber with fingers taped and still bleeding around the tape, a girl with hair wet from a shower and eyes wide because a test had been delivered by a stick, a grandfather whose face felt familiar because every man of that age and patience becomes a compass for strangers. O\u2019Brian found Mendez not under the clock because she refused to be ordinary on principle, but by the vending machines where she argued with a bag of chips that had decided to remain stubbornly at level B5. The detective had a coat that had flattered other women before her and had decided to forgive its new shape, and she had a posture that said she would not let a chip bag win even if it involved calling for backup.\n\n\"You look like the bad end of a good plan,\" Mendez said when the machine relented and the chips came down as if they had needed a moment to consider whether they belonged to anyone.\n\n\"Do you want me to say thank you,\" O\u2019Brian asked, \"or something softer that can be mistaken for gratitude.\"\n\n\"Say you'll listen for once. We've got a thing that smells like your kind of thing, and I need it to start smelling like evidence before my boss assigns it to someone who spells 'imagination' with a ticket book.\"\n\n\"I will listen,\" she said, and left the sword turned to rumor and the disc turned to coin at her belt. \"What did you find.\"\n\nMendez led her not to a security office, which would have been too symbolic even for O\u2019Brian, but to a small room with a sink that had worked at one time and a computer that had not been updated since the word update first went into the world with swagger. On the desk lay a stack of reports in a file folder that had corralled unrelated lives for years. On the top was a photocopy of a handwritten sign-out log from the refrigerated morgue unit in the basement, and beside that was a note written in hospital pen on hospital paper that had the word audit on it in a hand that had never been taught that certain words should be printed and not written if a heart is to be reassured.\n\n\"Two nights ago,\" Mendez said, tapping the log with her finger the way you tap on a tank to see if the fish will remember you, \"the freezer tech on graveyard did the rounds, because he does them every two hours, because that is how you keep a job and also sleepwalk responsibly. He notes there that Unit 4B had a temperature fluctuation of three degrees. He checks the seals. He checks the doors\u2014still sealed. He checks the inventory sheet. Three toe tags match three bed positions. He logs it, resets, goes on. Next round, it's fine. Yesterday the audit sheet shows all in order. This morning, a nurse with a conscience that won't retire says she thinks she saw a child in a hall that doesn't have children in it. The time on her chart puts her there at one twelve in the morning. We pull the hallway camera, which points at a door that points at another door that points at the stairs, because nobody planned for curiosity when they had the budget. There's a sliver. A shadow where there shouldn't be one. You want to guess what inventory in 4B shows now.\"\n\n\"Tell me anyway,\" O\u2019Brian said, because in stories if you guess right you rob the other person of their bread.\n\n\"It shows one bed with no toe tag. It shows one missing record that should have been impossible to misplace. It shows a signature that my tech says is just his own, but it's wrong in a way that feels intentional to people who read the same line and write the same name a thousand times a day.\"\n\n\"Quinn,\" O\u2019Brian said, and she did not like the way it came out, as if it had been waiting in the room and needed to be confirmed to get paid.\n\n\"Don't do that to me,\" Mendez said, but the fight had been coached to sit this one out. \"We found no body, if there was a body. We found condensation on the inside of a latch, as if someone had breathed against it. The tech says he is sure he did not fall asleep. He says he is sure he did not daydream that he left a door exactly the way he found it. He says he is sure of all sorts of things, which is what people say when they have discovered the precise shape of their doubt.\"\n\n\"Does anyone take a child to a place where children are not supposed to be and then bring them back up a stair that is not on a map and do it all between one twelve and one twenty,\" O\u2019Brian asked. \"If you were writing this down, would you trust you had not become someone else.\"\n\n\"I would trust that I had started to make a small catalog of questions that are going to buy me a headache. The other thing,\" Mendez said, turning a second paper around, \"is that a name has come up in three different locations you have already bothered me about: a vendor who supplies portable refrigeration units, short-term rentals, cash deposit accepted. They have a warehouse just inside the city line, they have a second location that is a PO Box with a flag, and they have a third address in a strip of storage units that we do not call a strip mall because there is nothing funny beneath it. The paperwork shows a renter with a name that has been scrubbed three times. The last version says Quinn S. Quinn S is not a last name I am willing to arrest yet. The storage unit number, however, I will give you.\"\n\nO\u2019Brian did not touch the paper. She did not need to. She knew the number. She handed Mendez back the chips because sometimes a story requires an offering.\n\n\"Don't go alone,\" Mendez said, as if she had an agreement with the city that if she said certain phrases often enough, they would accrue on a ledger somewhere and be cashed in on a day the sun was forgiving. \"Don't go, period. Give me an afternoon. Give me a judge who remembers me with something like consent. I will call the warehouse first. I will do the stupid thing properly. You will not show up and point at a lock with a glow-stick.\"\n\n\"You make fun because the truth is unsettling,\" O\u2019Brian said, but there was affection in it because between them the affection had learned not to get itself killed. \"I will give you until the deli closes. The one with the angel in the window. When the sign says WE ARE CLOSING WHEN WE CLOSE and the owner flips it around because he has decided to be unambitious for once, I will go.\"\n\n\"You need a leash,\" Mendez said. \"You need a board and a cat and an afternoon that is not yours.\"\n\n\"I need to keep someone from being kept,\" O\u2019Brian said. \"Not with a hero speech. With whatever is left of me that can carry a small portion of quiet.\"\n\n\"You're worse before noon,\" Mendez said, not unkindly, and pushed the chips back toward her because ritual matters.\n\nThe warehouse lived in a part of town that had once been factories and was now memory foam for businesses that did not want to be remembered. You could smell old oil even in the rain, which meant you were smelling ghosts. The sign read MID-ATLANTIC COLD STORAGE in letters that had a sense of humor about the gap between their ambition and their budget. The clerk, a man whose hair had been betrayed by his hat and whose day had been betrayed by a pile of invoices, took one look at Mendez's badge and decided he was in favor of the rule of law, and then one look at O\u2019Brian and decided he was in favor of not asking just yet. He said he could not talk about clients without papers. He said he could, however, talk about generalities if someone would sign for this delivery that was going to be an hour late in the wrong direction.\n\n\"We're looking for a short-term rental paid in cash,\" Mendez said in the tone that had been able to negotiate with a vending machine. \"A name that has been mauled. A unit that has been kept under spec. We are not here to shut you down. We are here to ask whether you have ever seen a boy in your business who looks twelve and older than that in all the wrong places.\"\n\nThe clerk folded a hand towel with more attention than it deserved. He said that trucks came and went and that sometimes people hid things in cold because cold preserves lies. He said that last week a man who smelled of bleach without having worked for it rented a chest unit and returned it with the inside wiped three times and the outside dented in a way that suggested someone had loved it with their boot. He said he did not, however, see children because the only way to do this job was to decide that certain things were invisible. He wrote a number on a napkin and slid it across to Mendez with the same careful disdain you reserve for the weather. The number was not a unit number. It was a tag for a dolly that had been checked out after hours. He said the log for after hours lived in his head, and his head said that the tag had gone out at midnight and come back at four and that the person who signed the clipboard had written S. Quinn with confidence.\n\n\"Do you get deliveries to the storage branch,\" Mendez asked. \"On Edbrooke, the one that pretends it has a night watchman when all it has is a dog that belongs to no one.\"\n\nThe clerk said that company policy was to act surprised when they found out about the dog. He said the storage branch had a pad for trucks and a habit of staying quiet. He said he did not own keys to those units because a person should not keep doors in their pocket that do not belong to them. He used too many words to say, be careful, which is how men like him ask forgiveness for not being brave at a particular hour of the evening that no one else saw.\n\nThey left him with his towel and his invoices and his own conscience, which would call him later. Mendez drove because she had long since decided that she would rather be the one to discover the flaw than the one to be betrayed by it. In the passenger seat O\u2019Brian held the disc in her palm and watched it tilt light into shapes that made no effort to pretend to be maps. The crack in it always made the rainbow think about its own limits. She wanted to hold it up like the cards drunk men use to tell their pasts and futures. She wanted to throw it in the harbor and see if it would learn to float.\n\n\"We're not going in,\" Mendez said as if the car could be persuaded to obey ethics. \"We are going to drive past and make sure there is not a parade with a banner. We are going to consider that you might be wrong.\"\n\n\"I am wrong every day,\" O\u2019Brian said. \"The day I stop being wrong I will need new friends and a hobby that does not cost bail.\"\n\nThe storage units looked like a row of excuses. Each door was a confession, each lock a compromise. The fence wore razor wire like a haircut that had gone too far. The dog who did not belong to anyone stood up, scratched at an ear that had been faithful longer than any person, and showed no interest in them at all. There was no parade. There was nothing that wanted to be seen, which is usually how you know you have the right address. Mendez let the car roll past, then turned at the corner and stopped where a billboard for a furniture store promised what furniture stores have to promise in order to get chosen over a mattress on the floor.\n\n\"I meant what I said,\" she said, not turning her head. \"I will go get the papers. Do not practice being a lock. Practice being a citizen. Go home. Write down your theories. Chew on your sleeve. Cut pictures out of magazines and rearrange them until they make peace. Do not climb a fence with a light in your teeth and your sword in your bag like a line from a poem that gets kids hurt.\"\n\nO\u2019Brian watched the dog and calculated how many times a person had to throw a ball to earn exactly that level of indifference. She said she would go home. She said she would eat the other half of the breakfast sandwich before it learned shame. She said she would wait until the deli closed, because that was not a lie and it got Mendez what she needed, which was time. The detective did not kiss her on the forehead because they did not live in a play, but there was a feeling in the car that sometimes pretended to be that.\n\nShe did not go home at once. She walked instead under the railway overpass where the concrete argued with pigeons about the ownership of droppings and graffiti. She stood with her hand against the cold pillar and let the current examine her like a doctor who had discovered a symptom he had not expected in a patient who had already exceeded his expectations. The hum that had been personal all night adjusted, widened, became civic again. It swept through the mortuary levels of three hospitals and the backup generators of two power stations and the half-lit storefront where a barber practiced shapes with his scissors when no one watched. It touched the storage units and recoiled and tried again, which told her that someone had learned to braid a sound against her sound. It told her that Unit 97 had been opened and closed and opened again in the last day, and that what lived inside did not like light but did not fear it either, which made it worse.\n\nShe texted Dev because she had promised herself something foreign called honesty. She told him she was going to do a thing he would not approve and that if he wanted to prevent her he had two hours and three methods, all of them involving talking. He texted back an emoji with a face that did not exist when they were younger and then the words, you promised once to let me try to be brave, and then he said nothing else because he had a patient or a conscience or both. She put the phone in her pocket because she did not want to see it choose silence, and she walked back toward a day that had put its name on a door and waited for her to step in.\n\nThe deli sign flipped at three, not because business was done but because the owner had a nephew who could not be collected by anyone else. The angel in the window had adjusted its harp to a key that might be called minor if angels could be accused of such. She went up the stairs and put the sandwich in the refrigerator, then took it out again and ate the half she had promised and left the other half because it is good to have a reason to come home. She checked the sword and told it a joke it refused. She checked the disc and watched as the crack took a little more. She cut a strip of tape and placed it over the note that still lived in the freezer, because sometimes to disobey yourself properly you have to do the gesture of care as well.\n\nDusk returned with the smugness of a friend who has been told twice to leave and has made a bet about your boundaries with a stranger. O\u2019Brian took the back stairs so as not to have to admire herself in the gossip of the building. She walked the long way to the units because the long way sometimes makes the short way more articulate. She counted streetlights and steps and the number of times a bus sighed at a stop where no one waited. By the time she reached the fence the dog had gone wherever dogs go when they are assured that if something happens it will not involve a ball. She climbed without making a promise about being graceful. On the ground inside she crouched and sat for a minute because the human animal hears better with knees bent. There was not much to hear beyond the insect hum of electricity and the wet articulation of rain that had decided not to stop after all.\n\nShe went to Unit 97 and put her ear against it and wished she knew how to hear thermal differences the way a thermometer does. The disc at her hip pushed against her as if it wanted to be involved, and she set it flat against the door and watched the light spite itself and then curl in. The rainbow tried to find purchase on metal. It did not. She took out the key she did not have and the lock she did not own and introduced them using skills that had been taught by people who had wanted her to go to jail so that she would have proof she had lived. The lock decided to be reasonable, and the door decided to accept that reason the way a person accepts a favor and then remembers the cost.\n\nInside was the kind of cold that remembers your childhood and tries to decide if it liked you then. She did not flip the light because she did not want to change sides. Her eyes found shapes anyway. There were freezers, three chest-high and two tall that each wore magnets shaped like whatever had been nearest the clerk's hand when he had gone to buy cigarettes. There were shelves that held boxes labeled with someone else's code, which is to say that they were labeled as if they had been made to reassure a person from far away. There was a chair that no one sat in because to sit in a place like this is to admit that you could mistake it for a room. There was also a trailing cable that had been wrapped with care and wrapped again and should have been government-issued. The current in her blood turned its head like a dog who hears its name in another room.\n\nShe stood very still and allowed her own breath to answer questions posed by the air. The freezers hummed, and in their hum was a full paragraph. One said work. One said wait. One said listen. She went to the one that said listen and stood above it with her hand outstretched, the way you put your palm above a baby to feel for fever. The temperature on the external display declared competence. The lock declared arrogance. She placed the disc on the lid and watched the way it changed the light in the room just enough to make a thought think of another thought. The crack ran its thin smile across the surface as if to say, what do you think a map is.\n\nWhen she opened the lid, the smell that rose was not the smell of meat or chemicals or death. It was the smell of old paper that has learned the art of keeping its secrets. Inside were rows of what looked like cassette tapes until you looked again and saw that they were not cassettes but something homemade, small cartridges with spools wound with thin translucent thread that caught light like the inside of a shell. Each had a label in a hand that wanted to be neat and did not fully submit, and the labels were single words. NO. NO. NO. OCCASIONALLY NO, as if the writer had not wanted to be boring. There were also names. Not the names of doctors at first. The names of teachers, a mother, a woman who ran a thrift store. You could tell the age of the hand by the early labels, how they pressed too hard and lost confidence in the curve, and the later ones, where the N became sharp like a knife that knew what it could cut.\n\nShe did not reach in. She let the cold roll against the skin of her arms like a dare, and she closed the lid, and she went to the tall unit and opened it because if you are going to be hurt by something, it is good to look it in the mouth first. Inside the tall unit hung a schematic made of string and thumbtacks. It would have been silly anywhere else. Here it had the weight of a liturgy. Threads ran between pieces of paper that held dates and places, a stain where coffee had remembered itself to be unstable, a photograph of an alley that could have been any alley and a silhouette that could have been a person if you believed in silhouettes. In the center someone had pinned a child's school project, a circle cut from construction paper on which was pasted the outline of a snowflake. The snowflake had been labeled NOWHERE in a child's hand, then, later, in an adult\u2019s careful block, it had been relabeled NOW HERE.\n\nThe other chest freezers held more of the cartridges. One had inventory sheets so tidy they made your teeth ache. This one held names she knew. BISHARA. KAY. M. The ink had bled once when whoever labeled the tape had not waited for it to dry, and then had been corrected in a small careful way that told her that someone believed in being forgiven by handwriting. There was one cartridge whose label was a woven braid of letters: HARROW. The O bled into the W as if it had not wanted to end.\n\nShe did not take it, not yet. She took instead the one nearest it with no name and a time scrawled in a corner. She set it on the disc and watched the crack choose a side before remembering it had none. There was a small player built into the bottom shelf of the unit that held the cartridges. It had been made out of love and spite, which is how good machines come to be when a person builds them to make the world less powerful. She threaded the ribbon like you thread a body through a difficult request. The machine accepted its task. When it played there was not the sound of a voice the way you expect to hear a voice when you listen to a tape. There was a room. You could hear the size of it in the way the air answered itself. There was a chair complaining quietly. There was a person breathing who did not want to be accused of that. And then, across all that, there was the word no. Not shouted. Not even insisted upon. Said the way a doctor says it when a study has told her a truth she hates. O\u2019Brian wanted to say that it was Clare, but of course that is not how truth works. You do not get to be given what you want first try. The word had the husk of years in it. It drifted and then was gathered back up by the machine and turned into a unit, something you could keep, something you could tuck inside a story and use when you needed heat.\n\nShe played another at random, and this time the voice had laughter in it before the no as if the speaker had wanted to be generous. A child's voice somewhere said something that could have been the name of a toy or a plea to go outside. The no this time was the kind that saves lives. She listened to three more and then made herself stop because there are addictions you should introduce slowly or not at all. The current ran through the unit and through her and back out to the city as if it could not resist sharing the joke: he keeps the sound of refusal because he cannot see himself not being refused.\n\nThe chair in the corner told her that someone had sat here listening to these, for hours. The string-and-thumbtack snowflake told her that someone had tried to organize these into theology. The child\u2019s NOWHERE told her that somewhere along the line a boy had done what children do: used a pun to declare the conditions of his life without knowing he had made art. She put the cartridges back where they had been. She put her hand on the HARROW label without moving it because touch is sometimes a contract with your own restraint. The door to the unit made a small suggestion of closeness and then corrected itself. She felt the small click in her knees that meant fear had learned her bones.\n\nShe should have left it all and called Mendez and waited outside in the way that people who pass tests do. She took one cartridge and two photographs and the small child\u2019s snowflake and a roll of labels because sometimes the way to stop someone from keeping is to make a copy of the thing they did not expect anyone to understand. She closed the freezers with the carefulness of a person who had learned this ritual from opening doors in houses where the strong slept. She turned to step out and saw that the boy sat on the chair he had not sat on a minute before.\n\nHe was still twelve or near it. He was wearing a different T-shirt because maybe someone had taught him not to be seen in the same clothes two days in a row. He had the same hair. He had more rain on him than the room allowed. He was looking at her in the way you look at a story that you realize halfway through is going to take something away from you if you finish it. He did not seem afraid of her. He seemed afraid of the part of her that would repeat his name to herself on a day she needed to be brave.\n\n\"You shouldn't open refrigerators that don't belong to you,\" he said, and then swallowed because the sentence had come out as if he were quoting someone else and he wanted it to be his.\n\n\"You shouldn't keep things that don't belong to you,\" she said, and when she heard herself she realized she had used a grown-up voice against a child, which is a sin that carries its own echo.\n\n\"I didn't keep them,\" he said, and the fury he had been training leashed itself to that pronoun. \"He did. He keeps everything. He keeps my breath when I don't use it right. He keeps the way my mom said no when she stopped. He keeps the sound the nurse made when I told her I know what comes next. He keeps everything that isn't allowed. He says he keeps me safe that way because nothing can get to me if I'm already inside.\"\n\n\"If you're already inside what,\" she asked, and because he did not answer she answered herself, \"if you're inside someone else\u2019s idea of you.\"\n\n\"You think you can make me put it down,\" he said, and he was not talking about the cartridges. \"You think you can tell the story until it lets me go. You're the one who put it on me, aren't you. You're the one who saw a shadow and didn't ask what it was. You're the one who called me Quinn in a building where names stick to walls. Do you know what you do when you say a name under your breath near a door.\"\n\n\"You invite it in,\" she said, because she had learned that lesson sweating on a floor with a handful of salt and an old woman who had slapped her knuckles when she got the Latin wrong. \"I'm trying to invite you out.\"\n\n\"You can't get me out if I'm already here,\" he said, and he tapped his forehead with two fingers like a doctor diagnosing a patient he had not been allowed to touch. \"You can't stop what happened. You can stop telling me about it like you made it so you wouldn't have to live with not knowing how to live with it.\"\n\nHe stood from the chair not quickly but as if he had been sitting in a movie that asked too much of him and now he was leaving to find a smaller story. He went to the tall freezer and opened it with expert hands and took from a shelf a cartridge with a label that said TEACHER and he held it to his ear like it could warm him. He said that there was a night when the person who made this place made him listen to all the ways people say no until he could repeat them exactly, and then he said he did not want to be someone who could do that, and then he scowled because the confession had been extracted from him by a person he wished had not been in the room.\n\n\"Who is he,\" she asked, because even if she believed that he was in the way she told this, there had to be a person with hands and a history to go find and touch and ruin.\n\n\"Sometimes he's a man,\" the boy said. \"Sometimes he's a hallway. Sometimes he's the cold. Sometimes he's nowhere and now here. It depends on what you bring him. He likes doctors because they think they know where the edges are, and he likes people who say no because it means they had an edge to begin with. He doesn't like you. He doesn't like you because you got there first.\"\n\n\"At the hospital,\" she said. \"At Mercy. Outside. You were there.\"\n\n\"I am everywhere I can pretend to be,\" he said, and the pride in it scared both of them. \"If I don't go, he goes, and if he goes, I get left behind, and if I get left behind I get called something that isn't mine again.\"\n\n\"We should get you out of here,\" she said, and he smiled the smile of a child who has been taught by a lifetime of adults that you cannot be what you sound like.\n\n\"You should get yourself out of here,\" he said, and then he turned and ran his fingers along the label HARROW as if it were a candle he wanted to blow out and he did not dare. \"He doesn't think you're real. You're going to have to make him believe you when you tell him no, and you don't even like to hear yourself say it.\"\n\n\"I say no all the time,\" she said, too fast, too late, too injured by being overheard by a child.\n\n\"You say not yet,\" he said, and then he did the kindest thing, which was to look at her as if he had just realized she had done something hard once that had nothing to do with him. \"You need a word that isn't a word. You need a door that was a door once and became something else. Take the one with the stain on it,\" he said, and pointed to a cartridge whose label had been smudged by hands she trusted and distrusted in equal measures. \"Take the picture of the alley that isn't an alley. Take the snowflake because it will keep you warm if you don't think about it. Then leave it all, because if he comes back and finds you here he will make you a tape, and then you'll have to listen to it and you'll never say yes to anything again.\"\n\nHe stood and made to leave and then turned back and said thank you to the freezers like a person at a graveside who thanks the grass because there is nothing else to speak to. He moved toward the door and paused because he had learned that pauses increase safety. He said, without turning, that if she told the detective with the facts that she had been here, the detective would be angry, but that the detective would not make her choose between being right and being kind. He said there were men in uniforms who made choices easier and worse. He said that he would be in the places where things open when they shouldn't, just in case she wanted to see him when she was tired of her own voice.\n\nWhen he left the air adjusted to his absence as if it had been rewritten. O\u2019Brian felt her heart practicing a slower rhythm and decided to reward it by obeying. She put the cartridges and the snowflake in her bag and closed the freezers as if she had been taught by a good parent. She took nothing with a name. She took the roll of labels because sometimes to break a thing you have to be able to name it first. She relocked the door from the inside and let it latch and then did what she could from the outside to leave as little of herself on the metal as possible. She walked across the concrete without looking like running, because the dog had returned and dogs have opinions about prey. She climbed the fence more quietly because the light had shifted and people heard different things at different times of day, and she landed on the right side of the city again with a knee that wrote her a complaint that would be filed in a week when she slowed down.\n\nShe did not call Mendez yet because she wanted to put her hands on the thing she had stolen and make it answer before she could be asked to lose it to a ziplock bag. She went home the long way again and watched the hospital on the hill breathe, and she kept herself from touching its skin because she did not want it to tell her that she had been selfish. Upstairs the refrigerator had made a decision about its humming and the angel in the deli window had turned its head toward a rooster that someone had bought because they had thought irony could pay rent. She put the snowflake on the table that wanted to be a desk and set a glass on it as if to weigh it down, and she lined the photographs up like witnesses, and she threaded the stained cartridge into the machine because mercy sometimes means not making someone wait for a verdict.\n\nThe sound that came out was like standing at the back of a church when a choir warms up. There was movement and place and the kind of silence that has been trained. A woman spoke and it was not a no. It was a yes dragged over gravel. The word was, \"Okay,\" said through teeth that had already been set for no. Then, over that, a man's voice, polite, that old dangerous thing, asking her to repeat. The woman said no then, finally, and it was not a doctor voice, it was the voice of a person who has discovered that she still belongs to herself when asked to belong to someone else. There was a child in the room, a laugh, then not, then the small sound bodies make when cold insists without violence. She stopped the machine because she did not want to add to the soundtrack of anyone's refusal, and she sat with her hands on the table and thought about the sentence in the freezer that had not blurred, and she thought about the boy with the old wet hair, and she thought about the detective who had to go to a judge and say the words storage unit without making a face.\n\nThe phone buzzed. Dev, with a message typed as if he had been called away three times while writing it. He said, \"Lena called me. She found something in Clare's email that she didn't tell anyone because she thought it was spam. It's a shipping confirmation for a package that never arrived. The origin is a company I do not recognize. The destination is a PO Box at the storage strip. The contents are listed as spare parts. The note from the sender says, 'For when you change your mind.' I am tired, O\u2019Brian. I am tired of everything being a pun. I am going to have to go back into surgery and pretend I know what I am doing. Please do not do anything irreversible without letting me be angry first.\"\n\nShe told him she had done something that would require penance and that she had done it carefully. She told him that his anger would be accepted later with coffee and the second half of a sandwich. He sent back a period, which is how some people force themselves to be gentle. She dialed Mendez because to carry this alone would be to invent a god. She told her that she had been to the unit and that it contained what she had said however many days ago: a freezer where a story had been made. She said there were no bodies. She said there were voices. She said there was a photograph. She did not say she had taken anything because she did not want to be a suspect in the language the law speaks.\n\n\"We are at the court,\" Mendez said, tired in the way that steals years later. \"I am standing in a hallway that has decided to be its own echo. Tell me now whether I should jeopardize a thing I have climbed for by telling the judge that there's art in a freezer.\"\n\n\"It's not art,\" O\u2019Brian said, and then corrected herself because it was. \"It is that precise project your child brings home that makes you sit down because you did not know someone you love had this much control over scissors. It is a ledger of a hunger. It is all the no in a city collected and offered back to us as evidence that the city deserves it. It's what he keeps because he cannot see it. You can tell the judge there's a man who wants to own what people will not give him, and that he believes that if he keeps it he will not have to look anybody in the face.\"\n\n\"I can't tell a judge that,\" Mendez said, but she meant I will find a way to say something that lets me do what I need. \"Stay put. Put your light saber in the freezer next to your note. Keep your hands clean. When we go through that door, I don't want to have to arrest the only person in this circus who insists on using complete sentences.\"\n\n\"I will be here,\" O\u2019Brian said, and put the phone on the table with the snowflake and the photographs and the sound of a no heavy in a plastic box. The refrigerator hummed and she let herself love it for its stupidity and patience. She thought about her word. She thought about no and yes and okay dragged over gravel. She thought about the boy's grief masquerading as cleverness and about the way he had thanked the machines. She thought about the force\u2014the current, the shape under the hum that had led her here, and she realized that she had been following it as if it were a river with banks when in fact it had been behaving like light all along, bouncing off things, refusing to be held, showing her what she had not wanted to look at by illuminating everything around it until that thing stood out in relief.\n\nThe door to the hall rattled the way a door rattles when a neighbor closes another door down the line and the building shares that fact as gossip. She looked at the pencil palimpsest on her wall where she had attempted to erase a name and had failed. She wrote the name again, not to conjure it but to refuse to be ruled by the idea that not writing it gave it more power. The letters came out too careful, too square, a child's blocky pride in getting the lines straight, and she left them there because a wall with the truth written on it is, at the very least, a wall she could lean her shoulder against while the rest of the world rearranged itself without asking for permission.\n\nWhen evening tried its third costume in as many hours she took the disc and set it on the windowsill and turned the blade on in her mind and listened to the city tell itself that it would try again. She decided that when the door knocked tonight, whether it was Mendez with her papers or the boy with his patience or the cold itself asking for a cup of black coffee, she would open it and do the ordinary thing first: she would offer a chair, she would point to the window as if to say, look how the light behaves when refracted, tell me what it does for you, she would take her own advice and stop telling certain parts of the story out loud to see if the silence could be persuaded to loosen its grip. The glass of the window made a small sound a person might have called nothing, and after a day like this that felt like a promise she could live with until morning argued its case again.By the time the knock came, the sky had decided that dusk should be a rehearsal and not a performance. It hovered at the window like a person who had lost courage on the stoop. O\u2019Brian stood with her hand on the back of the chair she kept promising to replace and told herself not to answer as if the door were a verdict. When she opened it, Mendez was there with a paper in a plastic sleeve and a mouth set to the shape of a person who had practiced saying reasonable things in unreasonable rooms. Behind her, a younger officer with a haircut that had not yet learned to be modest held a box of evidence bags as if it were an infant.\n\n\u201cTell me it still exists,\u201d Mendez said, and the paper made the sound of a small metal thing that had been legally conjured out of stubborn air. \u201cTell me that when we get there, there will be a door, and when we open the door, it will not reveal a broom and a family of spiders who don\u2019t sign their leases.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt exists,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and it felt like cheating to say it without also saying what she had taken out of it and pressed onto her table as if to domesticate it. \u201cIt hums. It thinks it is a church for a god I don\u2019t like. The dog will not help or hinder, which is a kind of mercy I am willing to take.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you touch anything,\u201d Mendez asked, and the words came out like a kind of prayer that had opted out of grace.\n\n\u201cI looked,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and then, because lies taste worse before dinner, \u201cI took a piece of the story because stories behave in public and I am not above bribery. You can scold me later. We are short on a few kinds of time.\u201d\n\nMendez looked past her into the room without doing the impolite thing to a person\u2019s space. The angel in the window downstairs caught the streetlight and pretended to play something in a minor key. \u201cBring it,\u201d she said at last. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know about it I can\u2019t lose it. If I do know about it I can make a judge regret giving me this paper when he hears me talk about art in freezers. Either way, if you have put your fingerprints where they don\u2019t belong, let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s a better reason than your habit of adopting strays.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brian wrapped the stained cartridge and the two photographs in a dish towel that had been too honest for dishes. She slid the snowflake between the pages of a phone bill, and she held the cracked disc like she had paid for it with something she could not afford to regret. On the stairs, Mendez carried the weight of her own patience like a toolbox she had learned not to throw, and in the car the heater pretended that all breath is good breath if you share it in close quarters.\n\nThe storage facility\u2019s fence was the same, which is to say that it had decided to age with insolence. The dog was there, which is to say that time had learned his schedule and made the compromise called habit. Two uniformed officers peeled from a second car and fell into positions people learned from television and applied to the real. Mendez handed the warrant to the night manager, a man whose vest suggested he had once believed in an order that the world had coaxed him out of. He read the words the way you read something that will cost you a conversation later and not money, and he nodded as if to say that this was not the worst thing the building had witnessed.\n\n\u201cDo you have a unit number,\u201d he asked, not quite willing to be impressed that the city could still point at a specific door.\n\n\u201cNinety-seven,\u201d Mendez said. \u201cI need you to tell me you understand that this is a polite day and we would like to keep it that way.\u201d\n\nHe said he did, and he did the dance people do when paper meets lock. The bolt cutters like a joke with sharp teeth did their part, the officers held their breath as if oxygen were a thing you could bargain for, and the door rolled up in a kind of metal shrug. Cold breathed out again like an old friend pretending it had just arrived. The lights inside warmed reluctantly and remembered their job, and the units sat with their lids committed to their roles and their hums tuned to the key called habit.\n\nIt was both exactly as O\u2019Brian had left it and not, which is to say that this is how rooms get even with you for assuming their loyalty. The chair had been moved half an inch, the trailing cable coiled into a more honest circle, the magnets aligned with a neatness that had learned to pass. Mendez stepped in with that peculiar courtesy she extended to spaces she hated. She tasted the air and made a face that could be mistaken for disdain but was actually grief revised into pragmatism. She looked at O\u2019Brian and then at the tall unit, then at the chest freezers, then at the wall where someone had once hung nothing on purpose.\n\n\u201cWhat am I looking at,\u201d she said, not because she expected to like the answer but because naming is what law enforcement uses so as not to become religion.\n\n\u201cA record,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cA hoard of the sound people make when they refuse because they are trying to preserve themselves. A person who thinks keeping the sound is the same as being allowed to own the moment. If you open this one, you\u2019ll find a machinery any department would have trouble describing without someone making a joke to hide behind.\u201d\n\nThey did not open anything at first. They photographed, which is how you tell future strangers the truth of your evening. They bagged dust as if it were a witness. They wrote down the color of labels and the way the tape curled at the corners where the cold had gotten bored. Mendez had a way of making details understand they were now part of the public record, and as she moved around the space the room changed allegiance by degrees. When the tall unit\u2019s door opened, the string-and-thumbtack snowflake tugged like a memory and corrected itself. A younger officer jotted in a notebook as if writing could keep him from seeing what he would dream about later.\n\n\u201cWhat is this,\u201d he muttered, and Mendez touched his sleeve with two fingers, which is how she reminded people that they would need their nerves next week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how some people write their faith,\u201d she said, and then to O\u2019Brian, \u201cWhere are the bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t bodies,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cIf he has bodies, they\u2019re elsewhere, and likely alive, if he believes in the kind of keeping he\u2019s been practicing. He would rather have thresholds than endings. He wants to own an edge, not a consequence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen this is theft of something worse than an object,\u201d Mendez said, and it wasn\u2019t a question and it wasn\u2019t an absolution either. \u201cWe found traces of dry ice residue near the loading dock at Mercy, but we could tell ourselves endless stories about that. I need a name I can put on a line. I need a face that is not a reflection of everyone else\u2019s fear.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brian did not say the name because she had learned that offering it here would be like chewing glass for attention. She moved to the unit that had said listen the first time and laid the dish towel down like a small flag and unwrapped the cartridge as if it were something alive that had agreed to be patient. Mendez watched her without pretending to be uninvested. The officers\u2019 shoulders squared up for a sound they did not know how to be true about. The machine made of love and spite accepted the ribbon with a small hiccup and then succumbed to purpose. The speakers whispered a room into existence, then sifted a breath, then placed a no on the table between them all like a coin that had gone through too many hands.\n\nThe younger officer made a soft surprised sound that he pretended he had not made. The night manager closed his eyes because sometimes what you were afraid of was less the content than the intent. Mendez\u2019s face did not move, which is how you see a person become a ledger. She stood there and allowed the sound to be the size it wanted and did not tell it to be smaller. She leaned down, looked at the labels in neat black and one bleeding blue, and placed a gloved fingertip near the one that had been smudged on purpose and said, \u201cYou need to tell me why that one matters more than the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s where someone tried to change a yes into a no and then back again,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hinge. He thinks hinges are hearts. He thinks if he can understand the sound of one, he can stop doors from behaving like doors for anyone but him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he the boy,\u201d Mendez asked, because she had seen enough ghosts to make a habit of not attributing everything to men in basements.\n\n\u201cHe is a boy when it suits him,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cHe is a hallway when it keeps him safe. He is the cold when he is convinced warmth is evidence. He has a face I have seen three times and would swear to, and a reflection I cannot hold onto, and a name that behaves like a switchblade.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the lock,\u201d the older officer said, as if to contribute reason by demonstrating on smaller enemies. \u201cWe have these machines. We have the handwriting. Is there a truck? Is there a receipt at a gas station where someone asked to break a fifty and lingered long enough to make a suspect of himself?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a dolly tag with S. Quinn on it,\u201d Mendez said, and the name felt like she had lobbed it into a pool to see if it would float or sink. \u201cThere is a clerk who folds towels and will dream about us with shame. There is a dog who will not testify. There will be footprints we will pretend are intact. There is exactly enough to knock on a door and not enough to make that knock stick.\u201d\n\nThe hum in the room fattened. O\u2019Brian felt it the way a person feels a weather front through a scar. The freezers did not change temperature because that would have been too obvious even for them. The light adjusted its ambition. The youngest officer shivered without admitting that his blood had learned to tell stories. Out in the lot, something scraped, a small phonograph needle across the surface of a night. The dog did not speak because dogs are better at certain silences than priests.\n\nMendez watched O\u2019Brian as if to say this is the part where you announce trouble and I roll my eyes and then we dignify it together. What O\u2019Brian said instead was, \u201cHe wants to make me walk in alone,\u201d because it felt like treason to narrate the machine when the person stood right outside like a decision. \u201cHe will make something open that did not intend to. He will use the pun because it\u2019s the only magic he trusts. He will say nowhere and mean now here, and he will make the door agree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we do not go through a door that can be made to agree with a pun,\u201d Mendez said, and if faith could clang, hers would have. \u201cWe stay in the room where my paper works. We do not go into the movie. We persuade the movie to come to us.\u201d\n\nThe scrape came again and found language. It was a latch persuading itself. It was an opening in a place that had not enjoyed such before. O\u2019Brian turned slowly because this was one of the few ways to negotiate with the theatrical. At the far wall, where the concrete had done its job without complaining two decades straight, a seam appeared because a person had decided to look right at it and lit it with a small stubborn will. The crack was not a crack; it was an invitation stubbornly misread. Frost wrote a parenthesis on its skin. The room did that thing rooms do when they wait to see if you will confirm their worst assumption about yourself.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Mendez said, and her hand was on the younger officer\u2019s sleeve now, rather than his arm, which is how you build a good habit where a person still remembers how to move. \u201cIf he wants her, he can want her in a space with witnesses. If he wants to make a poem out of a wall, he can do it while I name him into a record. You, stay. You, breathe. You, if you run, make it toward the front door and not into the next decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks you don\u2019t see him because you prefer the object to the story,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and she was looking at the seam with a soft pestering attention the seam could not stand. \u201cYou do see him. You see him so completely that he will stop believing he can invent you. Which is why he will take me, if he can. Which is why I would like to be rude to him while someone with a badge is writing it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you go through that, I can\u2019t write it down,\u201d Mendez said, and she said it as if she were explaining gravity, not asking a favor. \u201cIf you stay, I can turn this very stupid mythology into something that holds in a courtroom just long enough to keep him from breaking the next door in half. Choose my world or his. I won\u2019t forgive you twice in a week.\u201d She drew a slow line through the air with her finger, the way you tell a stray thought to heel. \u201cIf he wants to be now here, make him answer to it.\u201d\n\nThe seam did not vanish because you cannot embarrass a door with attention alone. It tried another trick. It made a smell arrive, something like peppermint scraped over steel. It made a sound shaped like the boy\u2019s cough. It put a shadow in the place where no shadow should be because the light had already filed a complaint. O\u2019Brian looked at the cracked disc in her hand and on impulse slid it into the seam the way you test the temperature of bathwater with your toe. The disc caught light and broke it up and offered it back in slices. The seam, which had been a sentence in a language the room did not admit to speaking, stuttered. It did not close. It did, however, stop behaving as if it were alone.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a religious text,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and if her voice shook she convinced it to do so in time with the hum. \u201cI brought glass that breaks light into something less lonely. If he wants to step out of a pun, he\u2019ll have to fit through the color he pretends not to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say the strangest comforting things,\u201d Mendez said, and then she lifted her chin at the older officer, and he made an executive decision to be calm in a job that had taught him how not to be. \u201cWe\u2019re going to inventory an altar,\u201d she added, because sometimes you push back against the cinematic by being bureaucratic. \u201cWe\u2019re going to touch nothing until the camera says we did. We\u2019re going to let bad magic get bored.\u201d\n\nIt almost worked. Boredom is a kind of law that works on most forces that like to wear the shape of a boy. The seam didn\u2019t like being treated as paperwork. It opened because it resented the idea that it should not, and in the spill of cold came the echo of a hallway that had made itself a career. It did not show a corridor. It showed the idea of one, a geometry put on like a coat. There was ice that did not melt. There were rails like the ones O\u2019Brian had described beneath the city, which moved nothing but still remembered the motion. There was, most of all, a topology of off-limits, a bureaucracy of edges obsessed with itself.\n\nThe boy came as promised, because what else could he be if not terrible at staying entirely away. He leaned his shoulder against the air as if it had decided to be wall, and he looked at them with affront pulled fine. He was twelve, and he was older than anyone in that room. He saw the uniforms, and he saw Mendez, and he measured them all without visible malice. Then he saw the cracked disc wedged in the seam, and he smiled with pride the way a thief smiles when he sees a trick of his own done back to him with respect.\n\n\u201cYou made a window,\u201d he said, and he said it to O\u2019Brian but not only. \u201cDon\u2019t climb. Look.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want the person who keeps these records,\u201d Mendez said, and she surprised them all, including herself, by addressing the boy without any of the condescension that makes children think we deserve what happens to us. \u201cOr I want the name he uses when he buys boxes. You can dislike me and still tell me the thing that keeps the rest of us from being stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a name,\u201d the boy said, and he tilted his head and answered in sentences that seemed to cost him. \u201cHe\u2019s a door in a city that prefers windows. He\u2019s the argument you have with a stranger on a bus that you keep having with yourself when you get home. He\u2019s the person who stood at a desk and asked a woman to look at him while she signed a form that meant he could not be given what he had asked for, and she did not look because she had learned to live, and he decided if he could not have the eye he would have the sound. You can call him Quinn if you need to. He will not turn when you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he turn when you do,\u201d Mendez asked, and the officer with the haircut let the question move around him and see if it liked his edges.\n\n\u201cHe turns when I get cold enough,\u201d the boy said, and he glanced into the seam as if to gauge the weather. \u201cHe turns when I do what the labels say and pretend it makes me holy. He turns when I say no five hundred different ways and none of them make a dent in his face. He turns when I make a map out of strings and pretend I invented snow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen look at me,\u201d Mendez said, and she stepped to where the boy would have to look up slightly, which is how you disarm a child who has been addressed too often by people who have learned to loom. \u201cLook at me and tell me if you want me to take the room that hurts you away. Tell me if you want us to write it down until it loses its appetite. Tell me what you want us to do right now that is legal and still kind.\u201d\n\nThe boy did look. He did it properly, which is to say with caution and speed. His eyes were older than most languages. He looked and then looked away because it hurt, or because he had been trained to stop short of troubleshooting intimacy. He said that if she took the room away, he might have nowhere to go, and if she left it, he might not ever stop going there, and that either way he would be furious, which is an honest position for a child to take. He said he wanted the tapes to stop humming when he fell asleep. He said he wanted the doctors to come out and make the same jokes they always made when they were the tired kind of good. He said he wanted to know that the word no could mean see me and not only stop.\n\n\u201cThen we start with what we can reach,\u201d Mendez said, and the words lived swaddled in a temper she rarely let out where people could see it. \u201cWe catalog every thread and every label and every hum until a person paid to be bored says yes to me. We pull the manifests from the vendor with the tidy trucks. We talk to the night manager until he remembers if he has a nephew who lifts. We do the horrible slow thing that almost never works until we make it work out of spite. And you,\u201d she added, and now the officer with the haircut was both ears, \u201cdo not go through that opening because it has not applied for a permit. If you see a person on the other side, you call me a poet under your breath and then you talk about locks.\u201d\n\nThe boy snorted without humor, which is how relief sometimes arrives in a room like this. O\u2019Brian felt the seam change its mind, once, as if light had convinced it it wasn\u2019t special. She kept her hand on the disc until her fingers forgot the temperature, and she listened to the freezers whisper their mechanical faith while the officers made lists that would later be stapled to other lists. She thought of the snowflake pressed inside her phone bill and the way it had held words with equal accuracy and indifference. She remembered the way the stained tape had said okay like a person lowering themselves onto a bed they did not trust, and she thought that if there was an antidote it would not be found in arguing it would be found in repetition, a citizen's dull and stubborn reply to the theatrical demand.\n\nWhen the photographer arrived and set his tripod up like he was introducing a friend to a situation it might not like, the seam did something new. It rolled backward, not away but in, as if the hallway had yawned. A man stepped to the threshold as if he had forgotten this action was one of those things that, done with too much awareness, changes everything. He was not dramatic. He was clean in a way that suggested rage. His hands were careful, the care that comes from living next to instruments too long. He was the kind of ordinary that made memory fail to develop its film. His eyes were ordinary too until they weren\u2019t, until you saw that they were the color of a puddle that had oil floating on it. He was neither handsome nor ugly, which is how you win certain wars in public. He looked like what you get when you grind rejection and patience into a paste and spread it on a face.\n\n\u201cThis is a storage unit,\u201d he said, as if caught in the act of doing inventory, as if a handful of badges and a sword-shaped shadow and a boy with a rain halo were interruptions he could invoice. \u201cDo you have authorization to examine medical machinery not on hospital property. Does your jurisdiction extend to refrigeration under a certain cubic volume. Is there a distinction in your paper between property and loneliness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can start with your name,\u201d Mendez said, and you could hear in her voice the training that teaches you to treat monsters like landlords. \u201cWe have S. Quinn on a dolly tag. We have a man who rents in cash. We have a freezer that thinks it is a chapel. You can make my job easier by deciding to cooperate before I have to become unreasonable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taken something,\u201d he said, and he was looking at the towel on the unit as if it were a wound he could diagnose by its care. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it is, which is precious, but you have that problem where curiosity becomes sanctimony. It\u2019s a storage unit. It stores. I keep what is not allowed because I am tired of the permissions of polite society. This is the term of art: evidence of the negative.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep refusals,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and she did not move because teachers had taught her that nice animals can be startled into bad manners when you go for the obvious. \u201cYou keep the sound of no because you cannot keep a face. You want to be given what you weren\u2019t, and you think that collecting the answer is the same as earning the question. You took a doctor whose no was precise and then you promised her that if she held still long enough the door would not change her shape. You took the boy because he was too good at practicing. You think he is your alibi.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he is my guarantee,\u201d the man said, and he did not look at the boy because he could not afford to. \u201cHe stands between me and the lack of it. He says no before the world can. I bring him where the world tells me no most, and I perform a substitution. The tapes are sacred. They tell me where the edges are. The edges cannot be trusted. Therefore, I keep them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a surgeon who is afraid of eyes,\u201d Dev had said once about a different man, and O\u2019Brian filed that for later because it wanted to be useful. She looked at the way the man\u2019s shoulders lived an inch higher than kindness. She watched his hands hover exactly above contact, as if contact would involve contamination of a kind he could not launder. She thought of the storage unit as an organ, the tapes as a thrift-shop replacement for a nerve, the seam as a valve that believed it was a metaphor.\n\n\u201cWe have enough to bring you in today,\u201d Mendez said, and she said it with that steady court-ready nothing that makes a person hear his own heartbeat louder than the room. \u201cWe have more tomorrow. I don\u2019t need you to be embarrassed. I need you to be tired. You\u2019re going to pick your tiresome poison. You can make this a religious argument or you can make it a municipal one. My paper likes both languages.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to look at me,\u201d he said, but the please didn\u2019t arrive because he had never learned it. \u201cIf you look at me while I give you the refusal, it will change your life. You won\u2019t be able to do this job anymore. You will get softer where it hurts. You will know that when women and children and doctors say no they are performing an act, and acts are cons, and cons have counters, and counters can be purchased. Look.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d the boy said then, and the words had impatience braided with something kinder. \u201cHe is practicing on you. He will make you participate. He will make a tape of you and call it consent. He doesn\u2019t know the difference anymore and it doesn\u2019t matter because his hands will continue to be clean in all the visible places. Don\u2019t do it. Keep your spine formal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a sermon,\u201d Mendez said to the boy, almost distractedly, because she had found a rhythm that did not belong to the room. She kept her eyes not on the man\u2019s face but on the nearest label because labels lie less frequently than breath. \u201cAnd I am not here to have my life changed. I am here to change paperwork into events. Sir, you are under arrest for trespass on hospital grounds, possession of restricted equipment without license, unlawful removal of medical materials, and a suite of eventually. You can choose quiet or talkative. Either way, I will make the time. Put your hands where my day can see them.\u201d\n\nFor a second, the man did nothing because for men like him seconds were the currency. Then he learned how many he had left and did the thing all men do when time disappears. He made a mess. He moved toward the seam with the intention of making all this into proof that they couldn\u2019t hold him, to be both now here and nowhere. He had a remote in his hand because of course he had a remote in his hand. He had designed a machine that would turn his apparatus into a song so loud it would drown out the law. He pressed a button and something in the units sighed as a compressor might sigh when asked to cool a planet.\n\nThe lights did not go out because that would have been sentimental. They doubled down. The freezers changed notes and went low. The seam did its trick, opening wider, which is to say it stopped making a moral distinction and returned to geometry. The boy took one step back, then forward, then chose not to run, and O\u2019Brian realized in that motion that he had been practicing yes in the privacy of his impatience and it had been exhausting him.\n\nShe pulled the disc out of the seam as if stealing a spoon from a magician\u2019s mouth. She held it up and caught the room in it and turned the cracked face toward the man. The rainbow did not redeem anything. It did, however, occupy the space between them with a fact that could not be denied. He looked away and then back and then away again, because looking at what he had denied himself hurt. She said no, and she did not drag it over gravel. She said it the way people say stop at a curb with a stroller. She said it like a person who has discovered that a word can be both a boundary and a shelter.\n\nIt knocked something loose in the room that would not be fetched again. The man did not fall down. He stopped pretending he could continue. The remote ceased to be an instrument and became a piece of plastic he would have to explain later. The officers moved with an economy that comes with a good day ruined and made wrists into sentences. The seam contracted because the room had decided to be polite to law for a minute. The boy exhaled a laugh that attempted to be a cough because he had once decided that joy would make him a target and had forgotten how to unteach himself that.\n\nWhen the cuffs sang their dull song and the man\u2019s mouth learned how much he relied on it to be dangerous, Mendez leaned in the smallest amount and said, \u201cYou look at the ground if you need to. No one here wants to brand you with their eyes. You have the right to shut up and I suggest, as a woman with the capacity for kindness that I ration carefully, that you exercise it.\u201d She turned to the night manager and told him that sometimes the happiest a building gets is when a story that had made itself at home is evicted.\n\n\u201cWhat about the doctors,\u201d the younger officer asked, because the human need to be comforted by fact is a habit you should feed when possible. \u201cWhat about the one with the email and the one with the flyer and the one with a girlfriend who keeps plants instead of giving up. What about the boy. What do we do with him now that he is not a metaphor in your reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe follow the chain of cold,\u201d Mendez said, and she wasn\u2019t performing for anyone. \u201cWe find the offsite units and the warehouse on the line where city law forgets to be brave. We find the trucks with dented fenders that paid in cash and the receipts folded into glove compartments on the wrong side of town. We go to every hospital and ask the morgue technician to let us watch him lock the doors, and we go through the video three seconds at a time until the shadow makes the mistake of repeating itself. We ask people who don\u2019t like to be asked. We keep asking. We do the worst job and call it good work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d the boy said, and there was a small rattling in the way he said it, as if a wheel had decided to stop pretending it had been round all along. \u201cDo you arrest me for being a hallway. Do you tell me to go home to a mother whose no didn\u2019t save me because she had to forget me in order to survive. Do you make me sit in a room and wait while you decide if I am an accessory to a kind of magic you cannot write down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou come with me,\u201d Mendez said, and the muscles in her cheek loosened their charade just enough for softness to get a breath in. \u201cNot as a thing. As a witness. As a child who has been doing a job he was not hired for. You sit in a place with a vending machine that will not withhold from you out of principle. You drink cocoa because that is the law in my section now. You answer what you want. You stay near. You do not disappear unless you have previously scheduled it with my secretary.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded once as if he had been given a script in a language he appreciated for its refusal to be impressed with itself. He glanced at O\u2019Brian then and said, almost in apology, that he had been practicing no so long that yes made him feel like a traitor. She told him that he could be both things and still get bread. He said he did not like bread with holes in it because the holes were lies, and she promised him the deli downstairs favored loaves that were not aspirational.\n\nThey filed the man past the freezers on his way to becoming paperwork. He did not look back, which is how people who worship the idea that they are obligated to themselves excuse themselves from goodbye. The seam did finally what it always would have done without attention: it cooled into wall. The unit smelled like people now, and that was as fine an ending for an evening as any structure could ask. The night manager cried without noise into the towel he had folded with such care because it had suddenly remembered its first job.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to gloat,\u201d Mendez said to O\u2019Brian when the door rolled down and met the ground and became, as is its intention, a door. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn your head and show me that profile you work on when you think we\u2019re not looking. You\u2019re going to go home and sleep with your boots on and in the morning you\u2019re going to give me what you took without making me ask twice. You\u2019re going to be mean to yourself for a few minutes, because you enjoy the ritual, and then you\u2019re going to stop. You\u2019re going to let me do my job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bad at letting,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and it felt good to tell the truth even if you intended to defect from it later. \u201cBut I can practice. I am not the only person in the city who has learned to rehearse the same word until it sounds like church.\u201d\n\nThey drove back through a town that had decided to allow itself streetlight again. The boy sat in the back with the officer with the haircut, who had decided to grow a conscience at a speed good policemen usually save for lectures. Mendez deposited him in a room that had a couch that smelled like all the things people had not said on it because they were worried about where the words might go. A woman with a loose sweater brought cocoa that tasted like a thin idea of chocolate and yet more sugar than any philosopher could recommend. Forms arrived because forms believe slowly in miracles. The boy signed nothing because he was not in the habit of cosigning other people\u2019s realities, but he answered questions that did not poke at his ribs and he asked for paper to draw a snowflake that looked either like the one he had made once and then lost or the inverse of it which is what you get when you finally admit that the same shape can mean more than one thing.\n\nDev called at midnight and his voice had the new fatigue that people wear when they are beginning something without meaning to. He said that he had looked at the shipping confirmations and found a route that pretended it did not exist, and he had called Lena and told her that she could break two plates if she wanted because that would be theater enough for the night. He said he did not forgive her for going in without him, and he did not need to because it was not his job and she would not accept or require it, and then he said that when this was over, which it would never be because these things are ecosystems and not events, he would like to sit at the deli and eat the thing with the bacon and argue about whether virtue deteriorates in contact with hunger. She told him she preferred to argue whether hunger improves virtue by making it less sure of itself, and he said he could perform both roles capably with sufficient coffee.\n\nAt home, the refrigerator greeted her with its stupid patience. She placed the cracked disc on the sill and did not sit near it because she had no interest in wearing a crown this evening. She took the snowflake out of the phone bill and pinned it to the wall with a thumbtack that had held up the photograph of a beach she had never been to and could describe anyway. She placed the stained tape in the freezer because it had proved itself a better container than metaphor, and she wrote a label in the neatness of a person applying to be forgiven and spelled the word hinge correctly the first try. She wrote QUINN on the wall, this time like a person filling out a form that does not understand how rich a name can be, and she drew a box around it not to imprison him but to keep the letters from making a run for it when she turned out the light.\n\nSleep arrived as if it owed her money and wanted to settle up quickly. It brought a dream that did not overextend itself: a hallway that had become bored with its own ability to manipulate space, a boy who asked if he could borrow yes for the afternoon and return it scuffed, a judge writing the word art on a form and pretending to be offended. In the morning, if morning was what we call the moment when light decides all this fuss is still worth it, she would take the cartridge to a woman with a lab and a sense of humor and she would tell Mendez what she had taken without inventing any extra poetry for the telling. She would buy bread without holes because the boy was correct on at least one point, and she would stand outside the hospital and listen to its breath and think, for once, not about no, not about yes, but about okay, and whether a city built of that word might one day stop collecting the opposite as if it had paid for anything with it.\n\nWhen light came, it did not come dramatically, because drama is for nights and their crimes. It arrived as a series of technical adjustments\u2014the window losing its interest in pretending to be a mirror, the coffee doing its lab work and coming out brown, the sound from the street moving up one register. She found on the inside of her door a note she had written to herself sometime between the third and fourth cup of yesterday and taped at eye level as if to remind a future uncooperative self of basic civics. It said, tell her the truth quickly. She took it down and put it in the bowl with the keys, and she carried her canvas bag to the deli because a person should not admit to having survived a night like that without buying something hot from someone who thinks he knows your name even when he\u2019s wrong.Chapter 7\n\nThe deli smelled like patience and frying, which is to say it smelled like someone\u2019s grandmother refusing to let a day be measured only by what it took away. The owner slid her a cup with the lid already on because he did not like to watch good heat leave without a fight, and he put a paper bag on the counter that admitted by its warm weight that it had been filled by hands which had no illusions about how virtue survives. He said nothing about last night because men who have been in the same place long enough to be mistaken for furniture understand that questions can be instruments or kindness, and this morning his inventory leaned toward kindness. She said she had questions for the day and he told her to give him its name when she found it, then waved her out with a napkin the size of most apologies.\n\nThe street did that bureaucratic thing it does when it has to take attendance. Buses coughed at corners and waited while nobody sprinted for them, cars announced their loyalties by how they merged, pedestrians rehearsed walking without confessing to themselves that they were rehearsing their lives. O\u2019Brian let the current run its fingers through her like an aunt who does not ask permission before straightening a collar, and she let the hospital\u2019s breath reach her without demanding that it justify itself again. She texted Mendez a small drawing of a dog to say that she was up and possessed of bread and that this meant, by their present shared grammar, that she could be trusted for at least ten minutes. Mendez sent back an address for a lab that lived above a florist and below an argument about municipal zoning, along with the word hustle, which in her mouth meant please and in other mouths meant the practice of living.\n\nThe lab smelled like the inside of a guitar case. Ella, who ran it because someone had to and because she had decided that sweat and laughter were both instruments, was the sort of scientist whose hair did not obey gravity unless paid extra. She waved O\u2019Brian in with a pipette as a baton and glanced at the dish towel with its careful shape the way you look at a box brought inside by a child who has said it is a secret. When the cartridge sat on her table, it made that small sound of settlement people also make when they have finally found a chair that accepts them without training. The photographs she slid an inch away from the stain because even pictures deserve the courtesy of being asked if they mind what they sit next to.\n\n\u201cI will not ask you if you stole this,\u201d Ella said, setting the pipette down and selecting instead a pair of gloves that made a soft starched-moral sound when they bowed to her fingers. \u201cI will assume you borrowed it from a friend with bad habits and a freezer. I will also assume you want me to make it sing louder than it wants to without tearing it in half.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want the room it came from to stop thinking it is in charge,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and she tried to find a way to sit that did not look like a crime. \u201cI want the word on it to tell us more than it wants to. I want your machines to be kinder than the ones we met last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy machines are mean,\u201d Ella said, and there was pride and apology in equal acreage. \u201cBut they have good boundaries and they do not expect anyone to love them while they work. That makes them better than plenty of men. Leave it with me, and leave me the smell of where it came from because sometimes even electricity cares about context. You look like a person who needs vitamin D and a sun you can borrow. Go to your church. Watch your weird aquarium hospital. Don\u2019t start any fights I\u2019ll have to testify about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll practice no,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and Ella\u2019s eyebrows made a small exclamation of solidarity that ended up looking like mercy.\n\nOutside, the florist\u2019s door had a sign hand-lettered to say that if you didn\u2019t see what you wanted you should ask, which is the essential lie even honest shops have to tell. The flowers arranged themselves like people at a party who had been told how many seconds to wait before initiating small talk. The rest of the block practiced being indifferent to all this and failed. She walked anyway, up toward the hill that now owned her mornings and her new confession that she had been wrong about where the city\u2019s loudest places were.\n\nDev was on his third coffee and had worn his smile down to court-mandated levels. He met her in a side corridor that had once been painted a dignified color and had learned instead to be a shade called promise-that-blackmails. He had the wet look of someone who has scrubbed and scrubbed and still carried home a day in the creases, and he had a pager that might as well have been an old lover who showed up unannounced and made demands he could not be rude to. He leaned his shoulder against a bulletin board that had long ago given up on displaying anything other than notices that had missed their dates, and he looked at her with the kind of affection that prefers to pretend it is cross.\n\n\u201cYou keep your bargains maybe eighteen minutes at a time,\u201d he said, and the words could have been a reprimand and came out as a truce. \u201cI was ready to be angry about last night, and then Mendez called me because she needed a list of things to ask me in terms her judge would like, and it is very hard to sustain indignation when you\u2019re making flashcards for justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can try again later,\u201d she said. \u201cAnger is a renewable resource if fed the right diet. This morning, I need you to tell me if you recognize the way someone writes down a shipment when the person has been taught to record things as if words were instruments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are only so many fonts on Earth,\u201d he said, but there was interest now, and he took the photograph Ella had scanned and sent and peered at the neatness as if it thought too highly of itself. \u201cThe company is a shell with better stationary than morals. The hand is trying for clerical and not achieving it; the N leans left like a person who hates crowds. The note on the bottom is the kind a person writes when he wants to be kind but also wants to be obeyed. \u2018For when you change your mind\u2019 is the sort of thing a person who has never forgiven anyone says when he is attempting charm.\u201d\n\n\u201cLena found a confirmation for spare parts that never arrived,\u201d she said, and the current tapped her collarbone like a metronome that has decided being useful should not prevent it from being annoying. \u201cThe origin was the line between here and nowhere, and the destination was a box at the strip. If I asked you to stop being exactly who you are and come with me to the harbor, would you remind me that consenting adults can make terrible choices?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would ask if you brought food because the surgery schedule does not care about gallantry,\u201d he said, but his eyes had gone already to where the water would be if the hospital decided it had earned a view. \u201cI have two cases and a family who want me to lie gently. I can meet you at noon for eleven minutes. Text me the lie you want me to practice. I will tell you if it is anatomically possible.\u201d\n\nShe left him because leaving is one of the ways you say yes to a person you respect. The ER hummed behind her like a hive that can\u2019t decide if the queen is out or back, and the elevator offered her the daily sacrament of being forgiven for pressing the wrong button. Outside, the harbor\u2019s color had decided to be biblical again and then thought better of it and settled for municipal. The wind was in the mood to pry but not enough to be criminal, and gulls executed their long practice of being both anarchists and statisticians.\n\nThe address on Mendez\u2019s text lived down in the part of the waterfront where businesses go to practice wearing aliases. The building had its new name bolted over its old like a medal given to a soldier who did not enjoy being thanked, and the front office was staffed by a woman who had achieved that blessed state of employment in which rudeness reads as fidelity. She asked O\u2019Brian what she wanted in a voice that made it sound like a philosophical exercise, and she looked unimpressed when presented with city paper forwarded on a phone by a detective who believed in words the way other people believe in saints.\n\n\u201cWe can show you the dock log and the power bills,\u201d the woman said, and she did not get up to do it because she had trained paper to come to her. \u201cWe do not store bodies. We do not store art unless it is a fish that someone thinks is handsome. We store cold. If you want a romance, take a number and go to the movies.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you rent space to romances that wear lab coats,\u201d O\u2019Brian asked, and the woman allowed the corner of her mouth to attempt the experience of humor as if for continuing education credits. \u201cDo you have units with names that were once delivered to a PO Box that learned to hold its breath. Do your delivery men come back with stories about customers who breathe like chest freezers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we have,\u201d the woman said, thumbing through the ledger with the same bored reverence you offer hymnals, \u201cis a seasonal increase in shellfish and a set of small containers that go out at night with the kind of paper that declares that nothing in them is trying to be alive. We have a guy who tips in exact change and does not believe in eye contact. We have a driver who says he has a cousin at Mercy and that the cousin complains the way men who love their work complain. We have a blue truck with a dent like a memory and a recurring invoice paid in cash that spells Quinn like it wanted to be French.\u201d\n\nWhen Mendez walked in, the room corrected its posture. The badge, when deployed with her talent for treating veneration as an office hobby, changed the air pressure almost as much as the units did. She asked for the dock log and then for permission to be ungenerous. She asked which nights the blue truck came and whether the number on the side had learned to be ashamed, and the woman found herself telling the truth at the pace you do when you have not practiced that specific obedience in a year.\n\n\u201cHe was here two nights ago,\u201d the woman said, and she looked at the line in her ledger as if it had been unfaithful. \u201cHe took a portable and brought it back empty, which is not unheard of, but the way he did it was like he was in a hurry to apologize and wanted to be stopped. He wasn\u2019t. He wore gloves because he was in character. He smelled like peppermint and a bad decision. This is me being generous with the adjectives. You look like people who intend to ruin my evening with noble causes. Use the loading dock. Don\u2019t scuff the striping. Bring me back my bolt cutters if you borrow them.\u201d\n\nOut on the dock the wind had a new set of teeth and was practicing. The blue truck would arrive after dark because that was part of its contract with suspense, and neither woman had the budget for patience that long. Mendez had a plan that involved a second unit near the river mouth and a magistrate who had discovered late in life that subclauses are a way to flirt. She shook her head at the water as if it had canceled on her twice and turned toward the second address, which, like all addresses that matter, lived three blocks from where a map would suggest.\n\nThey drove through parts of the city that had been built out of optimism and paint and then had opted for function and a different kind of singing. The second unit sat inside a brick building pretending to be respectable. It had a roll-up door that wanted to retire and a padlock that had met better people. The knock did the thing knocks do when they do not expect to be answered, and when the door went up, the cold inside did not perform; it was just work.\n\nThis room had fewer pretensions than the one in the strip. It had boxes with the words spare parts printed on them with that cheery font manufacturers use when they are asking you to believe something without checking. It had a table where someone had left a checklist with only the boxes that say return marked with care. It had a tall aluminum cylinder on a dolly that might have been liquid nitrogen once and was now just ambition. It smelled like unwashed metal and the little sins of men who do not believe the places they rent will outlast them.\n\nMendez had a way she did silence that made other people talk. The man sweeping in the corner tried not to make eye contact and failed. He volunteered a small biography of the blue truck that included details about its appetite for fuel and its disdain for parking tickets. He volunteered that sometimes a kid came by with a ponytail and a hood up in a way meant to be a disguise and instead became a declaration. He volunteered that roofs leak in winter and that God was probably a landlord.\n\n\u201cWhere does your blue truck sleep,\u201d Mendez asked, and it was the sort of question that sounds like small talk and is in fact the opening statement of a charge. \u201cWhat do you tell yourself when you watch it go. Do you tell yourself that the world is large and your part small, or do you tell yourself that stories are like snow and if you stand still enough they will land on other people first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sleeps behind Rizzo\u2019s bait shop,\u201d he said, and he did not look at O\u2019Brian because she was the kind of person whose attention made his heart flinch. \u201cHe likes the noise out there because it makes him feel like he\u2019s on the right side of a conversation. He likes the smell because it hides him from himself. He pays the kid in scratchers and calls him by a name that isn\u2019t his and the kid doesn\u2019t correct him, which is how you end up in the kind of trouble that looks good in a movie and ruins everybody for regular life.\u201d\n\nBait shops are churches for people who believe in repetition and statistics. Rizzo\u2019s had a bell on the door that had been pressed into service as a sleep aid and an open sign that had learned to be ironic. The blue truck had the dent as advertised, a throbbing bruise near the taillight that told the story of a day when someone had been looking at something else. Its back was locked, because theater insists on the lock even when it knows the protagonist knows how to make it irrelevant. Mendez shook her head, which served as her warrant to herself, and said they would return after they had performed the correct rituals. O\u2019Brian walked around the truck like a person saying goodbye to a stranger she had decided to like. The current reached for her and tripped and turned that stumble into a dance move and she agreed to be charmed.\n\nAt noon Dev texted eleven minutes exactly with a prayer-hands emoji he disapproved of conceptually. He met them at the bait shop and had a face that made people feel reassured because it looked like what currency would look like if it could get tired and still be reliable. He loaned his scrubs as legitimacy and addressed the truck in a voice that could have been used to coax a pancreas to behave. He pointed to a thing in the undercarriage that could be disconnected without violating any statute that would haunt a detective\u2019s career, and he said the best lies are the ones you could tell the truth about later if necessary. Mendez told him he was complicating her ethics in a way that would cost him coffee and he offered to pay up front.\n\nThey did not pop the lock that day because sometimes victory in a place like this looks like leaving a thing intact and watching who comes to touch it. They stationed unmarked cars with faces that did not fidget, and they found a bakery that sold bread without holes and put sugar on top of anything willing to wear it. The boy from the strip had been placed in a room at the station with a plant that had not yet been abandoned by city employees and had been given paper and a pencil and permission to be twelve in any way he could stand. He drew snowflakes and then cages for them and then erased the cages and then drew hands because he was more honest than the day and because the cocoa had made his fingers warm and this is how bodies declare the possibility of a future.\n\nWhen evening staged its daily coup, the blue truck woke. It did not expect to be observed because it was used to the kind of privacy that money buys when it is disguised as smallness. The driver had changed his hat and his mind twice before emerging, and he had the sort of posture that insists risk is a personal taste and he never liked salt anyway. The kid was there, not the boy with the rain hair but another kid who could be anyone if you weren\u2019t paying attention, and the kid got paid in scratchers again and did not look at the face of the man because he had been instructed by life to keep his eyes on the recipe.\n\nMendez did the thing good hunters do in urban settings: she used boredom as a weapon. She let the truck make the first error, which was to ignore a stop sign in front of a takeout where someone\u2019s grandmother was currently teaching the counterman how to remember names. She let it make the second error, which was to park with both tires on a line someone in high visibility had painted and meant to be obeyed. She let it make the third error, which was to be itself in public. Then she tapped the horn and the badges came and the truck\u2019s interior had to come to terms with its resume.\n\nInside were the markers of a small empire with poor taste. There were the racks and shelves you would expect, there were the seals that had not been kept faithful, there were empty slots that insisted they were not indictable. There was a smell like apologies lit on fire for show. There was a list taped to the inside door that someone had written in a hand pretending not to be fussy, and the list said pick up, drop, don\u2019t linger, don\u2019t be seen, which is the sort of thing people write when they have forgotten that lists are not charms. There was also a cooler with a custom lock and a plastic window the size of a book cover. Behind that, not pretending to be anything other than what it was, lay a person.\n\nShe was pale in the way people get pale when their blood has been asked to think about other things, and she breathed like someone who had made an arrangement with a machine and would like it honored. Her eyes were closed because the closed had been insisted upon, not because the body entirely agreed. There was a line taped to the inside corner of the cooler that led nowhere obvious, and there was a monitor shaped like a thrift store donation that permitted you to watch numbers act as if vigilance were the same thing as care. There was a toe tag because someone loved their own theatrical consistency, and on it, an initial and a last name someone had written while hating each letter, and it read ALVARADO, A.\n\nDev\u2019s face did the precise thing faces do when the part of the world they had decided to keep functioning decides to leave the room. He did not put his hands into a posture that would be confused with prayer. He put them to work dismantling a show, and he did it with a competence that has no music because it is too busy laying out instruments. He spoke softly to the woman not because he believed the body cared about tone but because he had learned that he does. He told her his name and the name of the hospital and the number of its doors. He told her the weather and the reason a detective would be in a bait shop. He told her someone loved her because he seemed like a man who had promised himself that whenever he got the chance to do that without lying he would take it.\n\nThe driver who had thought himself a decorous criminal looked like the moment a child realizes Monopoly money is insulted in other rooms. He said he had not known, that he had rented his integrity out by the hour with the same lack of reverence he brought to other rentals, that he had made the mistake of being small in a business that paid for large. He cried in a way that will always look self-flattering to people who have had to learn restraint, and he tried to direct the guilt away from himself by means of a story wherein he had been paid to be foolish and had assumed that foolishness has a law that protects it. Mendez told him his handcuffs would translate for him later and directed her attention to the cooler.\n\nIt is a particular kind of miracle when a person stirs not because you told them to but because the body is independent. Alvarado breathed in a new key, and the numbers on the thrift-store monitor debated their next rhetorical flourish, and Dev made the sort of noises that cause future prayers to be invented. The cooler had not been meant as an ark so much as a filing cabinet, but the body had decided to forgive it for being an accessory to survival. The lid took its time remembering it would be opened, and when it did there was a smell like paper that has taken on water and then learned to live anyway. Her eyelids fluttered with the frustration of beings that have to perform in order to convince the room they are real, and then opened, and the first thing they did was grab light and refuse to let go.\n\nO\u2019Brian stood with her palms flat against the nearest surface that was not a person and listened to the current change time signatures. She made herself look at the face on the toe tag and then at the face in the cooler, and she made herself hold those together because splitting them would have been a kindness with a cost. She did not say the name because names had a job and that job was to bind, and she could not afford to bind anyone to her right now. She thought of Lena and the plants and the pen left on the counter and the coat waiting for a shoulder that might forgive it for being abandoned. She thought about what the tapes had been stealing and what the man had believed he could purchase.\n\nThey moved Alvarado into the ambulance that had taken its time arriving because the city\u2019s resources had learned to triage with a cynicism that kept them moving. The EMTs did the special sacrament of speaking in numbers and forms and calling them facts so they would not break anything by naming it. Mendez went with them until the intersection where her jurisdiction turned into someone else\u2019s problem set and then stopped, as she had promised herself she would, because she had learned what it costs to be present at everything. She turned instead back to the bait shop, to the boy she did not have but had temporarily, to the unit with the string-and-thumbtack theology, to the idea of a man who had been arrested and now had to encounter the friction produced when a person is finally made to hold in his hand a version of himself the city can see.\n\nThe precinct had tried to be kind to the boy as instructed, which is to say they had put him in a room where the heat worked even if unsubtly, and they had not asked him the kind of questions that make adults feel like they are doing something while they are doing nothing. He had drawn and then fallen asleep on the couch like a person practicing consent. When he woke, he did not panic because there are ways the body knows how to be in rooms like this from long before we meet them. He looked around for the door as if it had recently turned into something else and then recognized Mendez and put his shoes back on with a neatness that would have made any grandmother bless his mother even if the grandmother had never met her.\n\n\u201cWe found one,\u201d Mendez said, and she did not name the doctor because she had learned from O\u2019Brian that you save certain doors for when you have more than one witness. \u201cShe is being rude to numbers as we speak. She is going to have opinions about how today goes. That means you have to have opinions about how your tonight goes. You can tell me to find you a place that is not a hallway. I am not the fairy godmother of city services, but I can call three people who owe me the kind of favor that burns slow and bright.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like rooms without chairs,\u201d he said, and the pencil in his hand disobeyed his grip briefly and rolled to the floor like a person saving a different person from saying something too brave. \u201cI don\u2019t like doors that have windows because it makes light dishonest. I don\u2019t like bread with holes because that means it cannot do the job it was taught. I don\u2019t know if I want a house that someone else thinks is the answer to a question they never asked me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a room where the thermostat does not live in a drawer,\u201d Mendez said, and she did not make a joke because jokes are for rooms that have already been made safe. \u201cYou want a phone that rings when you make it. You want to decide something small and watch as it stays decided. I have a foster placement three days old that has a dog with a personality and a rug with an embarrassing stain. They say yes to anonymity and no to saviors. You can try it and decide it is not for you without becoming a lesson for anyone else\u2019s blog.\u201d\n\nHe nodded like he had been given the word try and someone had told him it was not a contract but a window. He asked if he could bring his drawings and Mendez said only if he let the rug judge them. He asked if the dog would mind if he practiced saying no where it could hear him and Mendez said the dog believed in ritual if accompanied by biscuits. He asked if he could have the snowflake and O\u2019Brian put it in his hand without saying the word keep.\n\nThe man sat in an interview box with a table that had learned all the metaphors people had stapled to it and none of the jokes. He had requested a lawyer with the brittle politeness of someone used to getting service and then had decided to perform unrepresented until a person in a different suit told him to stop. He had very clean hands. He had a way of not blinking that would make a summer fly feel indicted. He had not offered his name because the name he liked did not belong to him and the one that did had not been used in any room that would flatter him. He said he collected artifacts. He said he could not be expected to suffer the city\u2019s hypocrisy when it came to which of its monsters were allowed to become museums. He said he did not like that the detective did not look at him because it violated a rule he had not written but expected everyone to follow.\n\nMendez listened at the exact speed necessary to make a man like that feel he had encountered an equal and an insult. She said the judge had signed three more papers and that his truck had fallen out of love with him in public. She said art, and he flinched because it was not his word and therefore threatened his belief that words are property. She said boy, and he did not flinch, which is its own confession. She said no and did not practice it, and his mouth made the small redrawing of itself you see when a poet is told to write a memo. She told him that sometimes the way you make a sound lose its magic is by writing it down until it becomes a line item. He told her she was a clerk of a dead god. She said clerks have better hours than wizards and got up to find a sandwich.\n\nOn the way out she passed Dev, who had come to tell them that Alvarado had become loudly alive in the way only doctors allowed to practice on themselves ethically can, and that she had said not okay once and then had taken inventory of her own bones as if they were borrowed and had declared half of them insufficient and the other half forgivable. He said he wanted to see the tapes in the morning if he could stand it and that he intended to be angry about all of this in a way that did not flatter him or anyone. He said he was going to take Lena to the plants because someone had to tell the greenery in careful tones what was going to happen next so it would not punish the apartment with a tantrum.\n\nThe apartment had remembered how to hold people when they were not sure about holding themselves. Lena looked like grief had been sewing in her and had run out of thread and was now waiting in line at a store. She hugged Dev the way people who do not practice hugging every day do it when it matters, and then she apologized for her hands and then kept them where they would do the least harm. The plants had taken their own counsel and decided to perform optimism in a way that would make anyone believe again in the science of light. When Dev told her what had been true for the last three hours, she made a sound he had not heard and would not forget, and then she did the thing you do in apartments like this because furniture has memory: she sat, she put her hand on the rug\u2019s embarrassing stain, and she said okay like a person unwrapping a medicine she does not trust.\n\n\u201cShe is not home and she is alive and she is in a building where rules still reprimand people,\u201d he said, and he watched her discover that her breath was a contract she could renegotiate after all. \u201cShe will be angry with numbers and gentle with anyone who asks her to be, and she will tell you she is sorry in ways that will make you and the plants both want to water something. We will hurt for the rest of this and then we will make habit out of whatever is left. If you want to break plates, I brought two from the doctors\u2019 lounge that deserve it.\u201d\n\nLena said she preferred to keep them out of spite, which was as healthy a decision as any on a day when an apology finally arrived like weather. She asked if she could go to the hospital and Dev said yes but slow. She asked if she should bring a coat and he said bring the one she loved because spite should be warmed. She asked if he would tell the stranger with the good ghost energy that she could come over and sit on the edge of a couch and say nothing and be listened to, and he said he would tell her and he suspected she would accept because she had trained herself to hear invitations even when spoken by rooms with plants.\n\nNight took its second shift without union representation. The city threw a dark blanket over itself that was not blanket and not dark but had learned that names are meant to be misleading. O\u2019Brian went home and opened the freezer as if it could have developed new moral positions while she was gone. The note she had taped to the inside still said what it said, and she did not tear it; she placed the cartridge labeled hinge beside the peas because some symbols last longer if fed cold as virtue. She turned the cracked disc in her hands until the rainbow exhausted itself and turned plain again, and she placed it by the window like a prayer you don\u2019t know how to ask and ask anyway. She took the glass sword out and held it because it purred in a key she had learned to hum under her breath, and she made herself laugh because laughter is one of the weapons that doesn't require a license.\n\nWhen sleep found her, it was a bureaucrat with an old briefcase. It asked her to sign three things and to initial next to the line that said she understood the risks of dreaming. She trusted none of it and agreed all the same. The dream did not try too hard because it had noticed the way she gets when ambition pretends to be art. It gave her a hallway that, for once, ended in a room with two chairs and a table and a window, and it gave her a boy who asked if he could have the chair that did not wobble because he had learned there is no age minimum on negotiating small mercies. It granted her a man who tried to say no and got interrupted by his own echo. It let her say okay and not die of it. It slid morning in between scenes so quietly she did not notice it had arrived until the radiator coughed in apology and the deli downstairs announced egg and bacon without asking her to deserve it.\n\nMorning had changed its mind about what sort of day it meant to be. It put a kind of grit in the wind that made men in suits consider sweaters; it put a shine on the pavement that reminded women who had been taught to survive snow how to read a sidewalk; it put a sound in the wires that suggested a transformer habit out back was preparing to audition for higher office. The text from Ella arrived like a bird landing, the simple declaration of a fact disguised as a small creature: you should come hear this, and bring your detective, and bring your priest if you\u2019ve got one, and bring your patience because I did a thing and now the thing is going to do a thing back.\n\nThe lab had grown new instruments overnight because machines reproduce when fed good gossip. The cartridge sat in a cradle that looked like a playground toy for adults, and the screen betrayed the fact that Ella had taught the waveforms manners with colored lines and gently scolding grids. She did not look at O\u2019Brian so much as aim her voice just to the left of her face, which is how certain kinds of colleagues respect the way certain kinds of mornings need to be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the word,\u201d she said, and she tapped a part of the screen that had chosen to be more interesting. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that comes with it. He didn\u2019t keep a no; he kept a room. He kept the electricity\u2019s complaint, he kept the swing of the air, he kept what your body does when it aches and decides to pretend that is a conversation. He kept breath and then taught it to harmonize. I pulled the word out and it fought me. Underneath it, the woman says okay first, like she has to convince the syllable she is allowed to touch it. Underneath that, a child says a name that the machine cannot decide to hear because machines love to misunderstand tenderness. And here,\u201d she added, and pointed to a small insistence at the edge of the waveform, \u201cis a voice that is not a human voice at all, unless we are prepared to accept that the hum has evolved to speak. It says, as much as I can pretend to translate, now here. I don\u2019t know if this helps you in court. It helps me explain to myself why my electric bill has made a pass at me for the last month.\u201d\n\nMendez had taken a seat without giving the chair permission to betray it, and she did not blink at the now here because she had learned to treat certain phrases as wallpaper that can be acknowledged without surrendering the room. She asked if Ella could tell them where a tape had been recorded and Ella said that sometimes rooms leave their fingerprints wherever they go, and she could tell them that this one had the breath of a compressor that was very tired and the rhythm of a building that had learned to be upright in a neighborhood full of reasons to recline. She could tell them that the sound of a train was present not as train but as the absence a train leaves in the air when the tracks have been ripped up and the road put over the ghost. She could tell them that the power had flickered twice during the recording and then refused to admit it.\n\n\u201cTake it all,\u201d Ella said, and she said it like a person who had been rehearsing letting go with a professional. \u201cTake the graphs and the parts and the theory that will ruin the appetite of anyone who isn\u2019t made for this meal. I will write a paragraph that makes me sound like a machine who went to college, and then I will take a shower and audition for a second job making wind chimes. Do not let anyone unplug my patience while I am gone.\u201d\n\nThey took it because theft of a future requires good tools and a bad conscience, and they had both in enough balance to call it policy. On the way down the stairs, the florist handed O\u2019Brian a small plant with leaves that looked like decisions that went well, and said it was a housewarming gift for a person who had been disabused of the habit of being cold. O\u2019Brian took it and imagined the boy\u2019s foster rug and the dog\u2019s opinions and the way the plant would learn the vocabulary of a home that might, with coaxing, decide to be one.\n\nBy noon, the hospital had begun its new liturgy. Lena stood at the side of Alvarado\u2019s bed and rearranged the water cup and the blanket five times without changing either, and Dev stood at the foot and recited numbers as if they had the power of absolution. The current moved through the room like a curtain being adjusted without a hand, and O\u2019Brian took its measurement and then put her palm to the wall the way one friend touches another to confirm both are still present. Alvarado\u2019s eyes found her not because O\u2019Brian is remarkable but because bodies recognize habitats, and Alvarado gave an expression that said she had cataloged her gratitude and would deploy it when it would not humiliate her.\n\n\u201cDo you remember,\u201d O\u2019Brian asked, and she made sure the question was not a trap. \u201cDo you remember at all a room with a seam that turned into a door. Do you remember a man with clean hands and complicated sentences. Do you remember the moment you decided to say no until someone said okay, even if that someone was you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember peppermint,\u201d Alvarado said, and her voice had to be convinced ahead of time like a dog that hates carriers. \u201cAnd I remember a child\u2019s shape at the edge of something that wasn\u2019t a room. I remember promises that we would sleep and still be working. I remember deciding that if I had to be very good I would be very good at a different thing than the one he wanted. I remember the word now being used like a threat. I remember thinking that a freezer is just the absence of fire.\u201d\n\nOutside the door a volunteer dropped a stack of pamphlets titled Taking Control of Your Health and said sorry in a way that declared an allegiance to order. Mendez stepped out to let a nurse adjust a machine that had too much to say this hour, and O\u2019Brian stepped back because surrender is what separates priests from zealots. She went down to the lobby to stand by the aquarium and rehearse the fish\u2019s way of making efficiency look like elegance, and for once she allowed herself to consider that perhaps some small architecture had shifted. Not the city\u2014cities resent adjectives like healed and behave accordingly\u2014but the way she held it, the way it held her, the way the word no had been removed from a man\u2019s shrine and returned to the mouths of people who deserved to use it without someone keeping score.\n\nIn the aquarium the blue fish that had always made her think of someone\u2019s cufflink did a deliberate loop and considered her out of one eye. She said okay to it, because she was practicing, and it blew a set of small bubbles that constituted within their own faith tradition an answer. She turned and saw the boy standing near the pamphlets, looking as if he had been instructed to keep his hands in his pockets and had obeyed until he forgot why. He looked taller in this light, which is a thing light does for boys when it suspects they have been measuring themselves against walls that lie. He said the dog had tolerated him, which is as good as love in that species, and asked if the plant liked windows.\n\n\u201cIt will tell you,\u201d she said, and together they stood like two shapes temporarily forgiven by an institution that has modern art, compassion, and fluorescent lighting. \u201cThere are rules about water and rules about light and the rule that says you can write your name on the pot if you want. It\u2019s yours until it tells you that it belongs to a room instead.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if this was the first real contract anyone had offered him, and he didn\u2019t ask for her name because names in hospitals live in the mouths of other people. He told her that when he wakes up now there is a space where the tape used to hum and that space is the kind of silence that is polite. He said it frightened him because he had gotten good at one kind of noise and choosing another felt like betrayal. She told him betrayal can be a practice that matures into discretion, and he did not look impressed but he took the plant with a field marshal\u2019s seriousness and went back to his dog and his rug with measured steps.\n\nOn the courthouse steps, the judge who had signed and signed rubbed at his hand because he had recently remembered that muscles are muscles and that writing can make a man ache. He had been a public defender once and had promised himself that if he ever got the black robe he would become a machine that says yes to the right things, and now he sat and ate a pretzel that had learned to be warm inside regardless of weather. He recognized Mendez because the city had made a point of allowing them to be in each other\u2019s radius, and he said he did not enjoy being made a poet by the evidentiary standard. She told him she did not enjoy being made a magician by the chain of custody. They agreed to be adults about it for another day.\n\nNight would come again because that is what nights do, but it would not arrive to find the same arrangements in the same rooms. There would be units with their lids taped shut and a man who could no longer enter certain sentences without being patted down by paperwork. There would be a boy with a dog and a plant and a snowflake that had decided to stay unfrozen on a wall for a while. There would be a doctor whose name would be returned to her things and who would teach numbers to behave. There would be a detective who slept three hours and then woke with a list that did not look like despair because lists are insulted by that use. There would be a woman with a glass sword and a cracked disc who would set both down for a moment to drink the stupid coffee from her stupid refrigerator that she loved because it had kept humming through a sermon.\n\nSomewhere in a building that had been forgiven by its owners for being a building and not a promise, a seam would consider making an argument and decide the audience had found another show. The current would go on practicing scales through the pipes and the rails and the wires, because it is not its job to judge the content of the rooms it connects, only to keep insisting that they are not islands. And O\u2019Brian, who had decided, without telling anyone and without promising to keep the decision beyond lunch, that she would say okay whenever the city permitted it, would turn her face toward wind, and laugh once, and allow herself a small hope of an ordinary morning that did not belong to a metaphor.Chapter 10\n\nThe city woke as if someone had shaken the blanket instead of folding it back, and all the grit that had gathered in the weave let go at once. O\u2019Brian sat at her table-that-wanted-to-be-a-desk and watched the cracked disc tilt daylight into shapes that looked persuasive even before they were sentences. The sword leaned against the chair like a joke she refused to explain, and the snowflake pinned to the wall practiced belonging to paper instead of weather. The refrigerator, appointed to low office as parishioner and metronome, kept humming an amen that never quite closed. She drank coffee that tasted like persistence pressed through wire and read the small list she had only half meant to write before sleep: the ice plant by the rail, the Annex on the pier, the patient list Alvarado had whispered by way of apology to her own brain. The list leaned on a name she still had not said out loud to her own wall, because names were contracts and she had already signed too many without a lawyer.\n\nMendez texted the way a person knocks on a door they intend to enter regardless, which is to say by sending a photograph of a map folded the wrong way and the words I hope you like antiques. The map in picture form showed a neighborhood that had once been drawn as direction and had been repurposed as proof of funding. The blue line of the old spur rail ran behind a building that had no need of being proud, and beside it in a hand that believed in vowels too much was the word ICE. Two blocks away, as if the cartographer had become briefly romantic, a note read tunnel sealed 1987 in pencil that had been corrected twice and forgiven once. They met under a billboard that promised retirement with the same font as communion, and Mendez did not say be careful because they had learned to save the obvious for when they were afraid.\n\nThe ice plant had been considerate enough to age honestly. No bright murals apologized for industry, no artisan coffee stood in for thaw. Corrugated skin dull with old frost, windows that had chosen opacity as a creed, a chimney that would never again be allowed to intend smoke. The fence around it was the kind of maintenance that proves a budget, new chain link glinting like a drunken bracelet. A sign told them to call a number if they needed a permit and to call their mother if they needed forgiveness. Mendez held up paper that instructed doors to behave and, when they didn't, instructed the person with bolt cutters to assist. They slid in through a gap that had been a gift from a previous era of men who wanted somewhere to drink and be alone in a group.\n\nInside, the cold lingered the way a song lingers after you admit you liked it. It was not the killer kind, not this time. It was the kind that sits down on your bones and makes a case. Rooms led into more rooms without deciding between hall and factory, a bureaucratic flirtation with utility. A conveyor stood like a bridge to no island. The current inside her shook its head and then remembered to point. In a corner that had been designed not to be one, someone had recently made piles of recent things: crates to which labels clung as if labels could stop any motion that mattered, a pallet jack with a wheel that squealed as if to say it did not have a literary life, coils of cord that had learned to be patient. It had the smell that follows peppermint into rooms where bodies need a reason for being still, and under that the iron patience of old refrigeration, the coil and the fin and the wish to move heat without ever touching it.\n\nShe took the disc out, not as a shield, not exactly. The crack had widened itself into personality overnight, and when she tilted it the light obliged, performing but also telling the truth about the glass. Mendez placed a hand on her shoulder as if to weigh her anchor, and together they walked toward the place where the current insisted an argument had been staged. Windows punctured the cinderblock like a cluster of thoughts someone had tried to erase with a sleeve. Each pane wore a film where breath had lingered, fingerprints smudged and then wiped by a person who had been taught to tidy and had stopped just short of sterile. A table sat beneath and was not a table. It was a station, a bench, a lectern. On it lay angles of black glass like the masks you find in theaters built by engineers, each bordered with tape that had been written on in a small neat hand that would never be accused of art: north tunnel, drain, chapel, pedi east, Annex. The black panes were one-way if you wanted them to be. They were also something else if you had brought the wrong word and the right patience.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look and look,\u201d Mendez said under her breath, the way some people give grace before slicing bread. \u201cPretend you are the fish and the pane is the museum visitor.\u201d\n\nThe pane nearest O\u2019Brian caught her because she had come expecting catch. The reflection it offered was not her exactly. It was the shape you would sketch of her if you had refused to learn hands. Behind that, layered so thinly you could mistake it for smudge, was motion in a place that should not have allowed it. A stairwell she recognized because the paint had peeled in a shape like a state she had failed in fifth grade, but the stairwell was here and not here, because the pane wanted to be a map and a trap both. Another pane held an alley that had decided to be a room for the night. Another presented the fluorescent insistence of a corridor whose doors had learned the bored dignity of clinics after nine. The captions made a geometry that didn\u2019t ask for consent. She traced them with a finger in the air instead of touch because the air had less jurisdiction.\n\nThe current, in her, through her, around her, leaned in like an aunt and said: eyes. She remembered the boy\u2019s flinch when she had asked if someone kept his eyes and how a fury had risen under his skin that had not known where to sit. This was where it sat. These were sight-harvesting things, not cameras exactly, not mirrors in the generous old bargain sense wherein you see yourself and understand an arrangement of light. These were panes that took the act of looking from one place and sent it to another place until the person doing the looking became irrelevant. The person collecting the looks had built for themselves a chapel of surveillance that would not need people to serve it in pews, only in passing.\n\n\u201cInventory,\u201d Mendez said, because she had invented a ritual that repelled the theatrical. The pen in her hand made a heroic sound against paper as it cataloged. \u201cPanels, six. Labels, five legible, one smear. Cords, coiled in a way that suggests better training than ethics. Smell, peppermint and iron. Dust, insufficient to comfort me. Get me the angles. Get me the measurements. Get me a story about how someone stands here and pretends they are a neighbor and not a thief.\u201d\n\nThey set the disc on the table and the light obeyed it. The panes grew uncommitted, as if a teacher had walked into a classroom and the maps on the wall had decided that geography could wait. Behind one, for a blink, O\u2019Brian saw the faint edge of a sleeve she knew by the way the cuff had been rolled. The photograph in Lena\u2019s letter had not been of a sleeve, but you could infer a sleeve from the tilt of a wrist. She inhaled and the room became a room again. Mendez\u2019s pen became a baton. Somewhere deeper, a compressor sighed the way a person does when the word rest is not grossly out of reach.\n\nQuinn announced himself by standing where he wasn\u2019t expected to be and making it look like he had been hired. He slipped in from a shadow that had been a door in a previous decade and had learned how to argue with hardware. Twelve or near it, the hair a little shorter because someone in a foster kitchen had kissed scissors and felt brave, a sweatshirt with a logo earned in a fluorescent aisle and made dignified by stubbornness. He nodded to the panes as if they were peers he disapproved of. He nodded to Mendez as if she were a lesson he had decided to accept the first time. He nodded to O\u2019Brian and for a second looked like he would smile and then chose another language.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to open them to be opened by them,\u201d he said, and he said it as someone offering and not as someone hoarding. \u201cThey collect it even when you label them wrong. He wrote chapel because he got tired of being wrong about that word. He wrote drain because it made him feel like an engineer. He wrote Annex because he likes naming things what they are not. If you tilt one toward your face you might end up seeing the parts of you that you outsource to afternoons.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do they take,\u201d Mendez asked him, and she asked the way you would ask a paramedic whether a joint should be moved.\n\n\u201cThey take the direction the eyes go, not the eyes,\u201d he said, and he looked at his shoes for the space of a word. \u201cThe looking. So someone can stand elsewhere and make you feel looked at or not looked at and you don\u2019t know which is worse for you. He told me you can make a person tell the truth by making them aware that they are watched. He told me boys like me are honest in only two circumstances and both involve spectators. He was wrong. But he built this to prove that he was right. That\u2019s what men do when thinking feels a lot like losing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pronoun,\u201d Mendez said, and she had developed, in the way good lawyers develop a spinal reflex, an ear for ownership. \u201cWe got one in cuffs who thinks clean hands are theology. Do we have another one under a different theology entirely.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks he is the building,\u201d Quinn said, and he pointed with his chin because pointing with your hand at this many panes felt like blasphemy depending on the sanctuary. \u201cNot the clean hands. The other he. He doesn\u2019t like being a person because it makes doctors not look at him while they help him. He likes being a seam because seams exist even when nobody blesses them. He likes being now here and he likes being nowhere and he has trained himself to believe those are the same place. You won\u2019t arrest him. You will make him lonely and he will move. He will use a different word. He will choose a different angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat angles are left,\u201d O\u2019Brian asked, because somewhere between the hum in her refrigerator and the hum in this plant she had learned that asking the tired child the hardest question sometimes refuses to break him in half.\n\n\u201cThe one where you look at yourself on purpose,\u201d he said, and he shifted his weight in a way that admitted how much he had been taught to measure his own presence. \u201cWhich is rude. Which is what you should do. He will hate it because it will make everything he took ordinary.\u201d\n\nOrdinary is a spell that is underused in rooms that insist on worship. O\u2019Brian tried it. She did an ugly thing. She put her face close to the pane labeled pedi east and she looked, not at a staircase or an alley or a seam, but at herself. Her face, her scar, the tired question protected by one more layer of joke than she could bear to keep tidy in public. The pane did not know what to do with her if she refused to be a corridor, so it did an honest thing and showed her the fluorescent bar, the flecked tile, the tired tackboard, and in the corner of a corner, in a way that would have made an intern curse because nothing was ever centered in this place, a coat on a hook that had not been claimed because the person who owned it had been encouraged to believe she had no claim on any space which a hook occupies.\n\n\u201cI know that coat,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and the words landed without dancing. \u201cLena knows that coat. It\u2019s a dark blue with a betrayal at the hem fixed with a thread color too proud for the job. He didn\u2019t steal it. He left it to be proof of leaving. He likes puns. He made an exhibit out of it and pretended not to be an artist because artists confess by accident. And the Annex,\u201d she added, and turned to the panel labeled Annex, because the one which says drain will never give you what you can drink. \u201cWhere.\u201d\n\nThe light in the pane that had been labeled Annex was bad in a generous way, washed from overhead and ashamed. It caught a stripe of water and long concrete that the harbor recognizes as a kind of devotion. A roll-up door born to resent itself had an orange stenciled P near the latch, and to the left of the door a man had hung a bell no one was meant to ring. Under the bell, a bronze plate that had no patience for plaque gave a number that used to be an address when the building still sent and received letters. It was the number Mendez had texted two days ago and then not followed because procedure asked her not to be clairvoyant in a way that would be punished later. It was the same number on a slip of paper at Lena\u2019s, in a confirmation about spare parts that never arrived, with a note that said for when you change your mind and meant, if you lose your nerve, I will keep it for you for a while.\n\nThe plant had another level, and the corridor to it had learned how to lie about the number of steps required. The compressor rooms in the underbelly had been refit to be storage for someone who believed in climate control the way men believe in generosity when they need to get elected. There was a door that had been painted the color of compliance and another door that had learned not to want attention. The seam in the second door had a memory of being a seam somewhere else and, upon being asked, performed. Not the dramatic peel-back from a television show that wants an eye; it did the small practical thing of admitting an error in measurement and offering a half-inch. That half-inch became politics. Mendez knelt, as if to communicate dignity to the bottom of her back, and listened. The sound on the other side was not a room but a person, not breath exactly but a body negotiating with space. The odor was not death and not hospital; it was paper that had decided it could be flesh with enough time in cold.\n\nQuinn stayed behind because he had learned through embarrassing trial that not all doors require witnesses who hate being tall. He sat at the table and lined up the labels the way a child lines up toy cars and argued a case for each: this one is lying, this one is confessing, this one is not yet done learning. He pulled the disc to him and breathed at its edge because as long as he practiced the skills he wanted and not the ones he had earned the city would remain negotiable. He said to the panes what you say to dogs in storms; stay. He could not be both hallway and boy and he had chosen boy for this minute, which is as honest a victory as the morning had asked from anyone.\n\nBehind the door that had been a seam and then a trial was a space that had a bureaucrat\u2019s idea of cozy. It had a cot with a blanket that apologized for being flammable. It had a chair that had endured the punishments of someone practicing sitting without permission. It had a small heater with a cord that would have bought a lecture from any uncle, and it had a bucket because men who build sanctuaries for themselves believe plumbing is a confession. It also had evidence of a person twice and then three times. A pen, an old friend of a pen, cheap brand, tidy line, the kind of tool doctors use when they have forgone the gift of fountain pens out of respect for reusability and for the way ballpoint forgives an angle. A list of three things on hospital paper, two crossed off in a hand that had not meant to be accomplishable and had been anyway. And the coat, blue with a hem stitched in a thread too proud, hanging on a nail as if it had been put there by someone who needed to keep their hands busy while trying not to revise a memory.\n\n\u201cClare,\u201d O\u2019Brian said without speaking the name and then spoke it because she had learned that the wall would not stop being the wall until she declared herself to it. \u201cClare.\u201d\n\nThe body in the cot moved in the particular way soles move when they have been cold too long and are deciding to forgive a future for offering shoes. She did not sit up dramatically because she was not that sort of person. She did the thing that nurses taught patients, and doctors forget, which is to evaluate the condition of a room against the plot of a day. She put her hand to her head and found hair and attached it to a timeline and found her way to an elbow and then to sitting that did not make anything worse. Her eyes opened knowing that there would be a test. They were the kind of brown that admits to being varieties in different light. She looked at Mendez first because an animal knows which person the room believes is in charge. She looked at O\u2019Brian next because an animal knows which person the room believes will misbehave and get away with it. She looked at the door last and refused to give it any ceremony at all.\n\n\u201cYou talk like a priest and a lunatic,\u201d she said, and the relief in it made the sentence stick to the air. \u201cWhere have you been.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been learning to say okay,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and she tried not to perform the smile that wanted to be a defense. \u201cYou left your pen everywhere but here and that made a line that was easy to follow. Dev is going to remove me from the roster of your friends if I don\u2019t bring you to him immediately. Mendez will make it legal to drag this building into a courtroom for its interior decorating later. The boy says your coat misses you. I am prepared to be very good at being in the way for the next hour.\u201d\n\nClare stood with a kind of obedience that disguised itself as luck. She bent to the list and let her fingers rest on the two crossed items, and there was a tremor that had nothing to do with the cold. The third thing read call Lena and the line beside it had refused to choose a fate. She swallowed. It was a thing bodies still do in the presence of hope\u2019s price. She put the coat on not because the coat would warm her but because it would make her legs recall a task. She picked up the pen because we hold on to our roles when our rooms change. She did not ask about the man with clean hands. She did not ask about the boy. She did not ask about the panes. She asked, \u201cDo you have any water,\u201d and Mendez handed her a bottle the city had paid for by tricking itself into thinking hydration is cheaper than fire.\n\nTwo officers did polite miracles and made the door remember its job. The corridor forgot to be seam for as long as it takes to argue about overtime in a van. Quinn met them at the table, his hands politely elsewhere, the disc with its crack willing to travel. He did not look at Clare the way a myth looks at a trophy and tries to take its own picture. He looked at her with the double speed of a boy and a person who knows that some adults have learned to behave like rooms. She looked at him as if he were someone\u2019s nephew left too long in an office on a holiday. She said, \u201cYou are the person the man thinks is keeping him safe,\u201d and his mouth did a small strange thing that might one day mature into a smile he could use against his enemies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the person who keeps practicing until a door finds a hobby,\u201d he said, and she nodded because she had been inside the kind of conference where men like to hear their own obedience spoken back to them.\n\nThey took the panes into custody, which was like arresting a collection plate. They photographed the table that had been an altar and the labels that had been liturgy and the cords that had been the spiderweb by which a woman\u2019s face could be moved across town without her consent. They packed the coated morning and the heater and the bucket into evidence as if any of those things had jurisdiction over meaning. Mendez put on her detective face, the one that declared she would testify later and look bored. She passed the coat as if it could be ceremonial, and it refused to be a symbol and became a garment, which is what a better class of metaphor always aspires to.\n\nThe Annex at the pier did not appreciate being surprised. The bell no one was meant to ring made a small disloyal sound when O\u2019Brian touched it with a knuckle, like an apology it had been keeping as petty cash. The roll-up door decided it would obey a piece of paper out of superstition and also because the mechanism had been left too long without grease and was embarrassed. Inside, the cold had not been taught humility. This annex was the clean place the plant had not tried to be. Seals in lines, corners apologizing by right angle for existing at all. A small office with a bubbling coffee maker that had learned to taste like repentance. A second room with a long table and a long window on which someone had drawn with a finger a shape that remembers snow only as structure. On the table, an inventory with columns named differently than anyone who had served in a war naming would have chosen. The word yeah lived in a margin in handwriting that did not belong in a ledger. The warehouse calendar had days crossed with a kind of manic fidelity that told you either nothing happened here or too much did and someone had to make a choice. There was a cooler, smaller than the truck\u2019s, improvised in the way good men improvise and bad men plagiarize. Inside, not a woman and not a boy, but a bundle of lenses and frames like a thrift store had tried to bury its best stock in ice. O\u2019Brian touched one with a fingertip and caught a tenderness that did not belong to her. Clare\u2019s glasses had been an act of small faith. These were other people\u2019s faiths, collected, poverty-struck, prescription guessed by men who liked pretending to be surgeons in everything but the part where they asked for consent.\n\n\u201cWe have a policy now,\u201d Mendez said, and the sentence had the tired authority of a woman who has made policy by momentum. \u201cWe take. We catalog. We ruin someone\u2019s filing system and call that justice. And we ask you what\u2019s missing, Dr. Harrow, if that is still a name you approve of belonging to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s missing is a conversation that would have been small enough to survive a winter,\u201d Clare said. She ran her finger along the frames the way a person touches old pews in a church that did not ask for her vote. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing is a place to put things that isn\u2019t a list. What\u2019s missing is Lena\u2019s patience and a plant that handles light badly and a dog that does not belong to either of us and will forgive us for this anyway. What is missing is mine to take back, or to set down.\u201d\n\nThe building had other rooms, because of course it did. Not a maze, exactly; a taxonomy. Refrigeration with labels like values. Freezer with labels like boundaries. Drawer with labels like names and then redacted in the legal conceit that redaction erases rather than decorates. In a drawer without zealotry they found a folder that held three receipts made opaque by a machine that hummed like a referee. On the copy line the gray above the letters read mid-atlantic cold, the way a person lowers their voice when they want to go unnoticed without being discovered to be shy. On the line for contents, spare parts in a careful hand that hated lying and did it anyway. On the line for note, the phrase for when you change your mind, again and again, written with an increasing confidence that makes a good prosecutor lazy. Beneath the receipts, a business card for a company called PARALLAX, a name someone at a desk had been unreasonably proud of. On the back, a single dried drop of coffee and the hand that did not quite know what to do with capital Qs had written harrow in lower case.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have mattered, the letter size, the case, the flourish or the economy. O\u2019Brian felt her own nervous system pull in like a tide. A letter\u2019s curve is a door. A door\u2019s curve is a sentence. This one had been made by the hand that had hung a coat and had made a list and had written not just notes but stories and had been punished for both. Handwriting keeps no secrets from people who have taught themselves to care.\n\nBefore the day got its other set of teeth and rained them down on the part of town that had invested in umbrellas, they took what they could and promised the rest a formal repentance. They put Clare in the back of a car in a way that made the car wish it were a chariot and drove her not toward home because home had a mouth too full of plants and regrets for that hour. They drove her to the hospital with the long doors. Dev met them with the kind of smile you put between yourself and instrument trays. He did not touch Clare the way movie doctors touch, like they have invented a new reason for skin. He touched the way people educated by the elderly touch\u2014brief, single-contact, plain. He said hello as a substitute for a hundred synonyms of relief, and he looked at O\u2019Brian exactly once and did not say anything because they had invented a kind of truce that is only valid when the eyes remain complicated.\n\nIf grief had had a stand-in, it would have sat in a chair in Lena\u2019s apartment and practiced saying sarcasm with a gentle accent. That stand-in was not needed. Lena did it herself. She stood on the threshold of the hospital room that smelled like competence and annoying generosity and she did not cross until invited, not because she was a coward or because she worshipped ceremony but because she had learned that an entrance changes the air. Clare looked up and the air did indeed change, but not the way theater teaches. It changed the way kitchens change when someone returns from walking the dog\u2014small, good, repeating. The plants in Lena\u2019s apartment found themselves included in a conversation three miles away and adjusted their leaves accordingly. The favorite pen lived for a while in a cup by a bed that had consented to be a bed only because some lawyer had convinced it that this counted as doing good and would get it out of a tax. Numbers were spoken, a nurse adjusted the angle of a pillow with more mastery than a general and zero patience for applause, and a plan was made that would look to outsiders like dithering and to practitioners like refusing to commit the sin of ambition.\n\nAt the Annex, as the sign on the pier winked at weather it could not outlast, a woman older than the clean-hands man and young enough to belong to a different club of sins stood in an office with a coffee smell and wrote a note. She wore neither villainy nor redemption. She had a ledger balanced in the place where some people keep their reasons. She spoke on a phone to a person who owned more words than she did and said phrases like chain of custody that had been forced on her as vocabulary by a week gone wrong. She did not use the word conscience. She wrote for when you change your mind on a sticker and frowned because the slogan had picked up connotations she had not budgeted for. She did not think of herself as he or she. She thought of herself as we. She would, that evening, call a lawyer who had known love once and ask what it costs to change the name of a company without changing the business. We\u2019s and paper know each other intimately.\n\nElla, at noon, pipetted what the panes had kept and found herself in love with new kinds of noise. She made pictures of sound and taped them to a cabinet the way people tape children\u2019s art to refrigerators when children have not drawn in that house. She wrote in a notebook the phrases that will be silly to anyone else: air remembers a path, the room protests being treated as a trumpet, the electricity is embarrassed at what it said in the hallway. She printed graphs and invented, because she had to, a way to say to a person in a robe that what they were looking at was proof and not a romance. Proof can be a romance if you don\u2019t teach it how to be shy.\n\nQuinn went to his foster dog and took the plant and chose for himself a corner that could be mistaken for fort. The dog, who had learned reportable tolerance of children in exchange for turkey, put her chin on his knee and accepted instruction in the ritual of no. He practiced saying no at a pace that would not spook her. He practiced saying okay to water the plant. He practiced putting the snowflake beside his drawing without being embarrassed to love something he had made. He practiced telling a woman with a rug that he would probably leave and that this was part of the arrangement, and she told him she had baked too many cookies and he was going to have to help. He took the cookie and performed disapproval to hide his gratitude, and she performed obliviousness to hide her heart. Both of them improved.\n\nThe clean-hands man sat in a room with a chair that had tried to forgive a hundred men and failed thirty times. The lawyer he deserved and the lawyer he got argued in neighboring hallways and produced the same conclusion. He could talk himself into legend or he could talk himself into prison. He had been talking himself into legend for months without achieving the stability legend requires, and he did what men do: he said an old sentence a new way. He said that he wanted to help, and Mendez said that she would accept help in the way one accepts a bottle of perfume from someone who buys apology as retail therapy. He said he had suppliers who thought they were in the cold business and on even-numbered days he worried that they were in the body business and he was offended by them for choosing poorly. She said to write the names in a way that would hurt his hand, and he did, because pain has a way of conferring authority he craved. He avoided the pronoun for the seam and for the boy. He slouched into myth for a minute and sat up because the chair groaned. He said, again to river his mouth, that he had built a listening machine because he wanted to turn no into a touchable object. He didn't say that he wanted to own a thing that had been denied him once and had continued to deny him forever. He didn't say, but thought, two women had said no to him, one at a desk and one in a church, and he had discovered that men are taught to build architectures when their arms cannot hold.\n\nAt the hospital, the volunteers delivered pamphlets and apology as a combo meal. Dev positioned at the foot of Clare\u2019s bed the way someone positions a bench in a park, with an eye to both view and conversation. He told her things about her body that she had already guessed and that he needed to have said aloud in the presence of other beliefs. He did not ask for an inventory of the room she had been left in, because he had learned from the kind of medicine he practices that when an organ fails in a certain way the most dangerous thing you can do is make it talk. Later, when the machines had calmed down and the light had decided it had other appointments, he told her that Lena\u2019s plants had done the thing where they look like they want you to notice and then pretend they don\u2019t, and he told her that the deli had added tomato without charging her which meant the owner was practicing a superstition on their behalf. She closed her eyes, as if to properly count that as luck, then opened them and asked him to make a list for her in his hand. He did. He wrote one. Eat bread without holes. Two. Thank the nurse with the shoe charm. Three. Call Lena and let the phone be the floor instead of a door. Four. Tell O\u2019Brian that the ghost of a patient she once followed is not her fault. Five. Ask Dev to drink water. He laughed and she went to sleep like a person allowing an employee to take over for a shift.\n\nNight stood outside the glass, waiting to see if anybody would roll down the window. The current, which had been instructed by no gods but had learned to be kind by being everywhere at once, ran its hand along the rails that were ghosts now, along the wires which had learned to update themselves by rumor, along the pipes which keep the city\u2019s version of life cycling and also keep secrets the way sofas do. It found the empty storage unit and said a polite goodbye to the jars it had refused to imagine as eyes. It found the bait shop\u2019s dented blue and asked the truck a question about character. It found Ella at her desk with her hair denying gravity and told her that she would never get paid enough for the kind of truth she told and thanked her anyway. It found the judge rubbing his hand and gave him an ache he would describe later as weather when it was guilt admitting it was a muscle.\n\nWhen O\u2019Brian got home, the angel in the deli had traded its harp for a trumpet the way angels do when they rehearse their secular albums. She went upstairs slower than necessary because a stairwell can interpret urgency as an insult. She opened the freezer and took out the old card with the instruction that had failed its test and had continued to be true because she had allowed it not to be. She turned the card over and wrote in an ordinary hand a new instruction that was not a command so much as a reminder, and she folded it the way you fold a letter you hate because it tells the truth. She wrote say yes to being seen and put it back where it belonged, which was in the cold, where statements go to be tested, disfigured, and then proven or forgiven.\n\nShe took the snowflake down and turned it over and wrote NOW HERE in her own hand with a pen that was too proud for the job. She put it back up because art is sometimes a promise you make to strangers and keep. She set the disc on the sill and watched the evening\u2019s lights break themselves into something useful, and she took the sword into her lap and told it the story of the day. It purred because it had been taught to, but also because in its own way it believed in the current and the way it insists that rooms are rooms and not verdicts. She laughed once, because she had an agreement with herself to do that daily, and when the laugh ended it left behind in the room a quieter noise, the kind of silence she had learned to learn from.\n\nThe phone lit up by its own rules. A message from Mendez with a photograph attached, a still from a security camera. Half a hallway, a mop bucket indifferent to myth, a hand reaching into frame to tug the cord of a light, a note in the foreground taped badly to a door with the words if found call and a number that mattered. The caption on the text read the Annex is cooperating in the way things do when they don\u2019t want to be sued, and underneath that in an uncommon use of punctuation from a cop as a gift to a friend: we might not be too late for the other names. O\u2019Brian stared at the hand in the image and could not swear whether it belonged to the man with the clean hands or to the idea of a seam or to a woman who had been told the word we and had started to believe she could be it and, whether she could or couldn\u2019t, had moved a light in any case.\n\nShe lay back without taking off her boots because some rituals earn grandfathering and some misdemeanors taste like dessert. She closed her eyes and walked the hallway the pane had offered her, not because she liked it but because it had proven it could be navigated without needing to become a corridor. She saw the coat and the hem and Lena\u2019s laugh sitting like a saved downpayment in the cuff. She saw the boy holding the plant and teaching the leaves the rule about windows. She saw Dev pretending to be stern about water. She saw Mendez blow her nose as if it were her job and then rip up the paper because ritual has to get bored somewhere. She saw Clare sleep with her mouth turned slightly at the corner because laughter waits in bodies that have been disciplined by other people\u2019s plans.\n\nMorning would come stupidly as ever, with light that had not read any of the memos. It would bring another Annex with another name and another ledger written by a hand pretending not to tremble and another lawyer tired enough to be kind by accident. It would bring men who think they can inventory the negative and put it on a dolly and women who will write their own lists to trick their hearts into consenting to continue. It would bring the aquarium and the blue fish tempted to become an analogy and refusing. It would bring another fight with boredom, which is the gentlest of the gods and therefore the most insulted, and it would bring mercy disguised as coffee. It would bring, too, the same long hum and the refusal of the current to become private property. It would bring, if she kept her side of the bargain, the particular kind of ordinary you get to keep when you have stopped collecting what should never belong to you.",

                              "content": "The harbor water wore the color of bruises that night, a slow violet throb under a sky full of sodium bulbs and smudged stars. Wind came up Off Pratt Street and found the cracks in everything. It found the seam in the old jacket and the knot in her shoulder and the mismatched window upstairs that whined whenever a bus took the corner hard. It found Mr O\u2019Brian, who sat on the marble steps of a rowhouse and held both hands around a paper cup gone soft with coffee and rain. She watched the hospital on the hill breathe in light and breathe out light, the way living things do when you look long enough.\n\nThere was a hum in the city if you knew to listen, and she had learned to listen. It ran under the streetcar rails that no longer carried streetcars. It spoke in the water-pipes, in the valves that did not fully seal, in the neon that crackled, on-off-on, all night. It ended in people. It ended in the very specific tremble of a woman waiting for her son to come out of surgery, in the staccato of a surgeon\u2019s hands that did not tremble until they did. The Force\u2014no, just call it the current; the Force belonged to the stories she had stolen and repurposed\u2014ran through those moments like threading a needle through a dress that might or might not fit. Mr O\u2019Brian could place two fingers on the stone leading up to the house and feel the city like a pulse.\n\n\u201cCold,\u201d she said to no one, and steam wrote her word into the air and tore it to bits.\n\nDown the block a bar named the Scupper opened its door, breathed out a rope of music and laughter and overcooked wings, and then clapped shut again. She didn\u2019t go in. She had a glass sword in a canvas bag and a silvery disc with a crack across it like a smile, and she had a list of names folded into a wallet that had once been leather and was now mostly prayer. She felt the current twitch.\n\nQuinn.\n\nThe name didn\u2019t like saying itself. It left the tongue reluctantly, as if halfway across a busy road with a truck coming. Quinn. The shape of him was indecency and winter air; the absence of him was a door that had closed behind you too quietly to notice, and only later did you find yourself in a different room than you thought you were in. He moved where doctors moved. He was fueled by it\u2014rejection, the kind that becomes oxygen, the negative of oxygen. He was the kind that learned every corridor map of every hospital he stalked, studied shifts, learned faces as if faces were combinations. He had a freezer, O\u2019Brian knew. That was not a metaphor.\n\nShe stood because she couldn\u2019t stand not standing any longer. The coffee slid into the trash can with a sound like something small admitting failure. A city bus yawed toward the hospital and she kept pace along the sidewalk, let it break the wind for her. Snowflakes came out of nothing to test the air and then thought better of it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t always walk in. Sometimes she stood across the street and read the hospital like a text, line by line, window by window: oncology got the south light, ER got the noise, cardiology hummed louder in the morning when caffeine caught up. Tonight she went in. Automatic doors made a sound like thin hands rubbing together. The lobby smelled like bubblegum hand soap and those towers of paper brochures that no one takes until they really need to. A flock of inhabitants in blue and green moved past her in various states of heat and urgency. She could tell which nurse was on an hour thirteen by the way she held her shoulders. She could tell which security guard had spent the afternoon arguing with his brother by the way he looked through people rather than at them.\n\nThere was a woman behind the desk with a braided bun and calm eyes. The tag said ALINA in plain block letters as if to say, I will be as simple as I can afford to be.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d O\u2019Brian said.\n\n\u201cEvening,\u201d Alina said, and now there was a smell of winter on her coat too. \u201cVisiting?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for Dr. Patel. He\u2019s on tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been on far too many nights this week,\u201d Alina said, and then, \u201cDo you have an appointment, hon?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll want to see me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will, huh?\u201d The hardness under the calm; the test in soft colors. \u201cI\u2019ll page.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell him O\u2019Brian,\u201d she said, and then, because it was Baltimore, \u201cMr O\u2019Brian.\u201d\n\nAlina\u2019s eyebrow tilted upward in a way that dared her to explain why she had said it like that, and then lowered again. \u201cPlease have a seat. It might be a minute.\u201d\n\nSeats in hospital lobbies were the kind of chairs that made you feel you were doing the wrong thing by sitting in them too long. O\u2019Brian stood by the aquarium instead. The fish moved like thoughts: purposeful, repetitive, decorative.\n\nA full minute later, and then another, Dr. Patel appeared like a man late to his own life. He smelled faintly of whatever it is a person smells like when they have scrubbed and scrubbed and the day still clings to them. He had a face like a good coin worn by handling. \u201cMr O\u2019Brian,\u201d he said, then looked around as if he had expected a different face attached to that sound, then saw her and remembered.\n\n\u201cDev,\u201d she said, and something like affection won a short, irrelevant argument in her expression.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a ghost, you know,\u201d he said. \u201cYou appear when I am too tired to be civil, ask questions I am unlikely to answer, and disappear before the cafeteria closes. It\u2019s very rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI brought you a sandwich last time.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stole half of it, then told me it\u2019s important to practice sharing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou looked happier with less to chew.\u201d\n\nHe smiled because he did that as a matter of principle, even when it made him later for something. \u201cWhat now? I have three patients prepped and one family about to ask me if I can guarantee anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cYou knew Dr. Clare Harrow.\u201d\n\nStillness. Not too long. Then he nodded once. \u201cI\u2026 yes. Clare was a resident here. Pediatrics. Bright. Sharp edges in the right places. She\u2026 moved departments.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t move. She disappeared.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not helpful for me, O\u2019Brian.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe walked out after her shift two weeks ago and didn\u2019t walk in again. Her phone pinged off a tower near the waterfront and then stopped. She had no reason. She had every reason.\u201d She moved closer so the sentence belonged to fewer ears. \u201cQuinn.\u201d\n\nDev\u2019s mouth made a shape as if he understood the sound but not the sentence. He placed two fingers against the bridge of his nose in the universal gesture for I\u2019m too tired to have this conversation but not tired enough to forget it later.\n\n\u201cYou keep saying that,\u201d he said. \u201cAs if a word is evidence.\u201d\n\n\u201cA name can be a hook.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are bad nights, there are worse. Sometimes someone leaves. Sometimes they leave and they come back. Sometimes they don\u2019t and it\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not because of a story you are telling yourself to make sense of your own nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cDev,\u201d she said, and the current rose in her like a cough, \u201che keeps things. He keeps what he thinks he deserves, because they refused him. Not money. Not time. Sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me this to do what? Make me look behind every freezer door I see? I\u2019m a doctor. Freezers do not frighten me. Stories do not save me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat saves you then?\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall, statistical improvements,\u201d he said, and the smile tried again. He had his hand on the pager at his hip. \u201cO\u2019Brian, I mean it. If you keep coming into my work with your\u2026 Jedi aura and your contradictions, I\u2019ll stop taking your calls.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never took my calls,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stop returning them, then.\u201d\n\nThey stood looking at each other for long enough that Alina raised her eyes twice from her paperwork to judge the degree of the stare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you names,\u201d O\u2019Brian said at last. \u201cDoctors missing. Two in Boston. One in Philly. Three who left notes so quiet you\u2019d call them drafts.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Dev said, but his voice wasn\u2019t a no, it was an I will but later.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell your detective friend,\u201d he added. \u201cI like to keep my life not only civil but also unharassed.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to ask anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake her ask you,\u201d he said, and let the pager lead him back to whatever waited past the lobby.\n\nOutside the air had found new teeth. The night bit a little harder. O\u2019Brian set her palm against the hospital\u2019s skin\u2014brick, stone, glass\u2014and waited until the current settled and then told her what it liked to tell her in the voice of an argument she\u2019d had with herself too often: He is not here. She believed it. Qu\u2014 she didn\u2019t say the name. She saved names for when they had more than one witness.\n\nOn Eager Street the deli still had lights on and a card taped to the window that read WE ARE CLOSING WHEN WE CLOSE. There was a wooden angel in the window too, the kind that held a harp and looked as if it could be talked into a sin. O\u2019Brian waved at the owner, declined a sandwich without being asked, went up the stairs to the room she rented by the week because the landlord liked to be reminded of rent by cash and faces. The landing sighed. The door took her key with a grudge.\n\nHer place was three chairs and a bed and a table that didn\u2019t have enough one-liners left in it to pose as a desk. There was a bowl beside the door where she put things that she wanted to find in a hurry: keys, a crumpled ticket from an aquarium she had gone to without anyone, a wrench she had borrowed and planned to return late enough to be forgiven. The canvas bag went on the bed. She drew the sword out and held it like she always did, with her palms open, as if it had its own in-progress decision to make about staying a myth. The lights went down, and the blade came up, a line of light the color of a promise you think someone might keep. It purred. It had a sound like speaking under your breath when you didn\u2019t want everyone to hear. She knew how to hold it because she had taught herself in a classroom of air and imagination and because she had spent too much time alone.\n\nShe turned it off because keeping it on was a waste and someone downstairs would complain about the noise or the way it made their spoons vibrate. She lay back on the bed with her hands under her head and watched the ceiling flake. There were cracks like maps. She traced them to no conclusion. Sleep took its time and then arrived sudden as a door slamming.\n\nShe woke to the sound of the freezer, and for a full two seconds, precisely two, she did not know if the sound lived in the room or in her. It was the old fridge, of course. The half-sized beast the landlord had shoved in a corner, its door held true by a magnet shaped like a crab. It hummed and hiccuped and once in a while sighed in a way that meant nothing. She lay there and watched the ceiling accept this answer and felt the current tell her, again, he isn\u2019t here. She had to stop him even when he wasn\u2019t here. She had to stop him, and the grammar of that sentence sometimes didn\u2019t fit.\n\nIn the morning there were new names. A printed flyer in the coffee place: MISSING in heavy letters. A woman named Dr. Alvarado smiled from a photograph that made a promise photographs often make: she had a dog, someone loved her, she made dumplings on Sundays, she was supposed to have more time. The barista slightly burned the coffee. He apologized twice. He said, \u201cYou look like somebody who is about to tell me a story, and I have a rule about that: I say yes. Yes, but no names. Yes, but make it end better than it starts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cNot yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen make it end like a joke,\u201d he said, surrendered the cup. \u201cEveryone deserves the mercy of a punchline before noon.\u201d\n\nShe went back to the hospital again that afternoon, because repetition was a kind of spell, because some doors open if you knock exactly the right number of times. In the ER the current shrieked and sang and argued with itself. A woman in a Ravens jersey held a towel to a little boy\u2019s forehead and explained loudly to the air that everything was going to be fine, not because she believed it, but because the air needed to hear. O\u2019Brian leaned on the counter with her elbows and let the currents pour through, and then Detective Mendez found her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re bad luck,\u201d Mendez said without preface. She had hair the color of a fact and eyes that meant to prosecute even birthdays. \u201cEvery time you show up, I lose a day off.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m yoga for your schedule,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cI stretch it, make it pop.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about popping in an ER. What is it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctors,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cLeaving without saying goodbye. Leaving small notes that say everything they cannot say out loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoctors work like they\u2019re being chased. Sometimes they run farther than they should. Sometimes they change names.\u201d Mendez shook her head, then jerked her chin toward the lobby. \u201cYou keep breathing my air like this and somebody is going to accuse me of taking advice from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cFor practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mendez said, softened it with a snort. \u201cTell me only what you know and nothing you feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know nine names in four cities. I know each had a colleague who could say with authority the word friend and mean it. I know each had a thing in common besides work: they told someone no. They cut something off. They refused a grant, or a relationship, or a visit. They said no.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone says no,\u201d Mendez said. \u201cEveryone also gets told no. It\u2019s the basic scaffolding of adulthood. It would be weird if these doctors had never used the word.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is someone who hoards it like fuel,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cSomeone who collects the heat of it and then uses that heat to power something worse.\u201d\n\nMendez looked at her as if she\u2019d just suggested the existence of a dragon in the basement. \u201cYou\u2019re doing the thing again. I can\u2019t write \u2018worse\u2019 on a form.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could. It would make good reading later. As a category.\u201d\n\nMendez said nothing. The wall-clock erased minutes with bureaucratic precision. A gurney kissed open a rear door and came in fast. \u201cGo home,\u201d Mendez said over her shoulder. \u201cEat something that isn\u2019t made by a machine. I\u2019ll call you if I find a Quinn in a file that smells like smoke.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t find him,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cHe\u2019s better at flinching than that. He\u2019s the shadow the motion sensor can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d Mendez said again, in a voice that had told other people worse things.\n\nShe went. But home was a place she carried around like a bruise, and if you pressed it the wrong way it told you old stories. She walked down to the waterfront and stood where the last of the light turned metal, and she turned her face to the wind as if it had come to apologize for something. She wrote the names on the inside of her head in order: Harrow, Yi, Alvarado, Bishara, McClelland, Kay\u2026 and when she tried for the rest, the current folded in on itself and turned into a noise like a television left on in an empty room.\n\nQuinn worked nights too. He was a figure you saw as glass makes a pass by light and shows you a stranger in your own reflection. O\u2019Brian had seen him three times and would have sworn to each. She had watched him pause outside Mercy, once. She had watched him slip between two parked cars and vanish like he had stepped sideways into a thinner sort of air. He had. He\u2019d learned to use edge spaces. He\u2019d learned the geometry of neglect. How many cameras point at a loading dock? Enough to give the ambitious a chance. How many eyes, though, watch the world because they love it? Fewer. He took the difference.\n\nAt night when she did sleep, the dreams came like messages written on fogged glass. She would be in a room that had no corners. She would be in a freezer aisle of a supermarket that had abandoned its branding. She would open a door and there would be jars labeled not with names but with a notation that meant both possession and prayer. She would wake and the hum of her own refrigerator would be gentle and stupid, and she would hate it for its ordinary patience.\n\nShe saw Dev again on a Tuesday that felt like a Thursday, which made sense because nothing else did. He looked at her and said, instead of hello, \u201cI got an email from Clare three days after she went missing.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t move. Sometimes the current had to hold still to listen. \u201cWhat did it say.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018I can\u2019t look anymore. I\u2019m going to go somewhere colder.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cCold is quiet for some people,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cCold is the room you go to when your voice hurts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was scheduled,\u201d he said. \u201cSet to send in three days. Or someone did that. And there\u2019s something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI got a letter in the mail. Paper. No envelope. It was folded into a flyer for a medical supply company. There was a single sentence in handwriting that did not look like Clare\u2019s. \u2018He keeps what he cannot see.\u2019 That is nothing, O\u2019Brian. That is a game. But I wanted to tell you because I am so hungry for the noise that explains the noise that I will eat anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t nothing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone who knows what happened and wants to be punished for not stopping it. It\u2019s someone who thinks they can balance the scale by frightening you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it working?\u201d\n\nShe looked at him, and for a second she saw an old friend she had lost the right to claim. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nHe rubbed his hands together like he was cold. \u201cIf I give you a name, will you be careful with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am careful with names,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you trying to teach me to be kinder?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Dev said. \u201cHer girlfriend. Her name is Lena. If you scare her, I won\u2019t forgive you this year.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances next year,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and took the piece of paper he had written the address on like it was something alive.\n\nLena\u2019s apartment near Charles Village had plants that preferred her company to light and a couch that had taught itself to forgive a lot. Lena had hair that would have looked like carelessness if not for the precise way her fingers snagged in it when she was trying to interrupt a thought. She let O\u2019Brian in because Dev had called her first and said, \u201cShe is a good ghost.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t dead,\u201d Lena said with a breath that had waited to be an accusation for days.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say she was,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cI think she\u2019s in a room. I think she thinks someone closed the door.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a priest and a lunatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been called worse and softer things. I don\u2019t have a better language. I am working on it.\u201d\n\nLena\u2019s hands went to the plants and came away with soil under the nails. \u201cClare left her coat,\u201d she said. \u201cShe left her coat and she loved that coat. She left a list on the counter that had three items and two were crossed off. She left her favorite pen. She never leaves her favorite pen. I know how this sounds, like your letters. I know. I know. But those are the holes that let the cold in.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wore a new coat once,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cSomeone told her it made her look too tall and she laughed and said good. Has anyone come around?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo detectives who smelled like polite exhaustion and one of them asked me if Clare might have been depressed and I said if you asked me that again I will metaphorically call your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cMetaphorically,\u201d O\u2019Brian said.\n\n\u201cI am a good citizen,\u201d Lena said. \u201cThat is how we speak to authority in this house.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes the name Quinn touch anything in here,\u201d O\u2019Brian said softly. \u201cIn the air, in your stomach, in the part of the wall that always looks like a face.\u201d\n\nLena flinched. She looked at the plants as if they had betrayed her by continuing to be green. \u201cClare had a patient last month. Quinn was the name on the file. Or maybe I am putting it there because you just did. No. No, I remember her saying it. \u2018Quinn is back again,\u2019 she said, as if it had been more than once. No last name. Pediatric psych consult. A boy who had written the word NO on his notebook eight pages straight. Twelve years old. Eyes the color of soda. Clare said he was beautiful like a thing that would be very dangerous to love.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot to love,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cDo you think she wrote to him. Do you think he followed her outside of work. Do you think I should stop asking questions.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lena said to the last one. \u201cBut if you can stop asking all the others by stopping something, do that.\u201d\n\nThe plant nearest the window tapped the glass twice as if to count.\n\nOutside, the weather remembered it had a job. Rain unrolled like a thin sheet over the city. The wind became an accomplice to nothing in particular. O\u2019Brian stood under a small overhang and did the kind of arithmetic that never added up and only sometimes soothed. Dr. Clare Harrow, whose laugh had left notches in the hallway. A boy named Quinn who wrote NO until the word had no sound. A pattern that might be a pattern because she needed it to be.\n\nThere were places in the city that weren\u2019t maps. Places you had to be told to find by someone who didn\u2019t like you enough to lie. One was a storage unit facility that had a fence too shiny and a clerk who didn\u2019t lift his eyes enough. People hid things in storage units because they wanted to believe in the eventual rescue. O\u2019Brian went there because the current tugged and because twice in the last three days she had followed Quinn past the shape of it in the rain. She bought a lock without saying she needed one. She walked the rows and let the numbers fail to matter.\n\nAt Unit 97 she stopped. It was nothing. It was exactly the kind of nothing that constitutes a shadow. O\u2019Brian placed her palm on the metal. Cold ran up her arm like a story she\u2019d heard before and then fallen asleep before the end. A light flicked above her with a sound like someone asking not to be added to a list. She stood with the key she didn\u2019t have and thought of thirteen ways to undo a simple lock, six of them illegal, three of them implausible, four of them requiring a friend she didn\u2019t have.\n\nBehind her a boy coughed. A real cough, not a rhetorical one. She turned, and he was twelve or near it, hair too long over his eyes, a T-shirt with a superhero whose name had been argued over by a thousand lawyers. He looked at her like you look at a car as it slides toward you on ice.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hang around here,\u201d he said, which is what a lot of people say when they mean please don\u2019t look at me.\n\n\u201cNeither should you,\u201d she said. \u201cIs your name Quinn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know my name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think you do. That\u2019s not the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cI make guesses,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s how I don\u2019t fall asleep in the middle of a sentence.\u201d\n\nHe watched her sword bag as if it might bark. \u201cAre you a Jedi.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn good days I am,\u201d she said. \u201cOn bad days I am a person with a costume, which isn\u2019t the worst thing to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stop what already happened,\u201d he said. It came out too formal, like something he\u2019d been taught and practiced.\n\n\u201cSometimes you can make its echo quieter,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have a freezer.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because it was such a stupid question, because it asked too much of him. \u201cWhy would I have a freezer.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome people keep more than they should,\u201d she said. \u201cSome people think that if they keep things, they will stop time from taking everything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how it works,\u201d he said, but his voice slid down to say, I want it to be.\n\n\u201cDoes someone keep your eyes,\u201d she said.\n\nHis head came up fast. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, and mortified rage painted his cheekbones. \u201cNo. That\u2019s not what\u2026\u201d Then he saw her face and understood that she had asked something else, something that had nothing to do with anatomy and everything to do with the ability to look at the world and say, yes, I will let you in. He stepped backward and then forward. The rain made a pattern on his shirt. \u201cAre you going to tell,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI tell stories,\u201d she said. \u201cI only tell on people who have stopped telling their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone lies about monsters,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you can tell who tells the truth. The liar makes the monster look small enough to step on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the truth,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe truth says that if you see it,\u201d he said, \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t come closer.\u201d\n\nHe went then, so fast that the current broke two fingers trying to catch him. She pressed her forehead against the metal door of Unit 97 and felt the old scar there where she had learned what happens when you think you can find your way in the dark without help.\n\nTwilight built its ugly apartments and moved in. The city changed keys. The deli downstairs closed late because the owner recognized a man\u2019s hunger and exchanged it for tomorrow\u2019s hunger. O\u2019Brian sat at the table-that-wanted-to-be-a-desk and placed the glass disc on it and the sword beside it and the names in front of her and said, \u201cI could be wrong.\u201d\n\nThe words were strange in her mouth. Not because she didn\u2019t say them often, but because this time they had teeth.\n\nThe letter from Lena had a photograph tucked in it, and in the photograph Clare held a paper cup and a dog tried to drink it and someone\u2014Lena\u2014had caught them both laughing. O\u2019Brian set it beside the names. She felt the hum again. The hum of her refrigerator, faithful and stupid and obstinately domestic. She stood. She opened the freezer.\n\nEmpty things can be loud. An empty box suffers. An empty shelf imagines bruises. The freezer was not empty. There were ice trays with a few thick blue wedges, a bag of peas as hard as a pillow of rocks, an index card she had left in there because she\u2019d read somewhere once that cold would erase the ink traces left by old letters. She had put it there to test the truth, and then forgotten the test. Her own handwriting lived on it anyway. The words were: Stop telling this story. The ink had not blurred.\n\nShe closed the door with the carefulness of an apology. She sat down. She placed her palms flat. She said, like a person reciting the Lord\u2019s Prayer in a language no longer used by anyone she knew, \u201cYour job is to listen to the current and then tell me when I am lying.\u201d\n\nSilence.\n\nAnd then, a whisper, not from outside but from whatever in her had claimed to be older than her. The voice that held a measure. The voice that told her where to put the light so that shadow could show its edges.\n\nThe whisper said, He is in here.\n\nShe stood very still. Her reflection in the window did a good job of imitating her. She laid a hand against her chest like a witness. Of course he was in here. Not in the room. In the story. In the engine that made her wake up and pick up the sword and haunt hospitals and frighten friends and raid storage facilities she couldn\u2019t spell her way into if pressed. Quinn had been born of rejection. Whose rejection. He kept what others could not. What had she kept. On the card in the freezer she had obeyed herself for a second and then disobeyed.\n\nShe could tell a new story, tonight, if she wanted, about a woman on a rowhouse stoop and a hospital that breathed and a bar whose door opened when you didn\u2019t want it to and a detective who loved answers the way other people love sports and a doctor who smiled against his own better judgment and a boy who knew the names of monsters and a man\u2014no, not a man, a shape\u2014that moved in the negative space and collected sight because he could not stand being seen. She could tell this story until it was the only architecture holding the night up.\n\nShe got up and paced because pacing is what you do when you want to wear through a thought to see what is underneath. The blade in the bag hummed once as if something brushed its pelt. The disc on the table refracted the light into a shallow rainbow that broke and reunited whenever she moved her hand. In the hall someone\u2019s radio whispered a game. A neighbor laughed with too little comedy in her voice.\n\nShe tried to hold onto the boy\u2019s eyes without grabbing them. She tried to remember exactly how he had said you can\u2019t stop what already happened. She tried to sit inside that sentence and see if there was a window. There was. It was behind her. It looked into the alley. It showed her the reflection of the room, and in the reflection it showed her that something written on the wall in pencil had been erased so thoroughly that the skin of the paint shone.\n\nHer own handwriting again, a year older, three years older. She could see, when she squinted, the ghosts of letters. Q. U. I. N.\n\nShe closed her eyes. The Force\u2014no, the current\u2014moved through the city, found the hospital, found the boy, found Lena\u2019s plants, found Dev\u2019s empty hand on the counter, found Mendez leaning back in a chair until the chair said I\u2019m not built for this. It found O\u2019Brian, who sometimes forgot that names are contracts and contracts are cages and cages are comfortable in winter if you have learned to decorate them.\n\nOutside the rain lightened. The street breathed out. She did too. She wiped her hand across the window as if that would clear something. It didn\u2019t. She was going to stop him. She would say it and say it and say it until the sentence found its way into a room where it fit. She would stop him even if the room was only the inside of her skull, which had always been one of the rooms the city lets you rent. She would stop him, and that would be something, even if everything else still wore the difficult color of the harbor.\n\nThe night cracked just enough for morning to argue its case. It would be early yet when she took her sword and her cracked disc and went out again, to the hospital, to the bar, to the storage place that pretended to forget. There would be names with new letters. There would be the same fluorescent lights. There would be the hum\u2014her refrigerator, someone else\u2019s, the unit down the hall, the old transformer out back\u2014all of them singing the same stalemate hymn. There would be her. There would be Quinn, insistent as a story you tell to keep from sleeping. There would be the current. There would be the possibility, small as a fish in an aquarium trying not to make an exception of itself, that a thing you made in your mind could sit down with you and negotiate.\n\nShe lay down with her boots on and slept in bursts too short to be useful. In one of those bursts she opened the storage unit, and in the storage unit, neat rows of jars watched her without seeing. No. Not jars. She refused the picture. She made them stones. She made them marbles. She made them labels without contents, and when she woke she knew that the negotiation had begun, and that closing a door is sometimes the only way to find out if it was a door at all.",

                              "content": "Morning did not arrive so much as collect itself on the edges of things and wait for her to accept that it had courage enough to try again. She felt it as the way the hallway's bulb steadied, as the way the deli below her swapped out yesterday's coffee for today's, as the way the street out front admitted that even if the sky did not clear, it would proceed. She washed with water that bit at the face and drank coffee that remembered it had been someone else's first attempt and pulled on the jacket that had lost the argument with wind, and she took the canvas bag not like a burden but like a witness. The note she had rescued from the freezer she folded twice and then again until the paper became an object rather than a sentence, and she put it in the bowl by the door with the keys and the wrench as if what you leave behind blesses what you carry.\n\nThe deli owner looked at her as if she had slept on a bench his grandmother would have disapproved of and handed her a round roll cut crooked that held eggs with an opinion and bacon that made you forget its history. He did not ask for money, which meant he would ask later and call that interest. He said, not unkindly, that she looked like someone who had decided to wrestle something large that did not know it was a metaphor. She said she had added vegetables to her breakfast and was therefore already exceeding her capacity for virtue. He laughed and asked if she wanted a second napkin and then pressed two into her hand in case one had to be used for a reason that did not involve her mouth. She ate half on the walk because you should always let a thing get cold on its own terms.\n\nHer phone, the kind with hairline cracks that the case no longer pretended to control, hummed in her pocket with a message from Mendez that contained a time and an address and the words try not to narrate me. The address belonged to a smaller hospital, not the one on the hill with the long doors but the one with the sleepy tree in front that had lost three branches in last winter's storm and had not yet made up its mind about optimism. O\u2019Brian texted back a grocery list because sometimes you keep faith by irrelevance, then walked as if the sidewalks had been made to namedrop her shoes.\n\nThe ER at eight in the morning resembled a ferry terminal that had forgotten it meant to leave. People stood with the everyday catastrophes that circle a city: a plumber with fingers taped and still bleeding around the tape, a girl with hair wet from a shower and eyes wide because a test had been delivered by a stick, a grandfather whose face felt familiar because every man of that age and patience becomes a compass for strangers. O\u2019Brian found Mendez not under the clock because she refused to be ordinary on principle, but by the vending machines where she argued with a bag of chips that had decided to remain stubbornly at level B5. The detective had a coat that had flattered other women before her and had decided to forgive its new shape, and she had a posture that said she would not let a chip bag win even if it involved calling for backup.\n\n\"You look like the bad end of a good plan,\" Mendez said when the machine relented and the chips came down as if they had needed a moment to consider whether they belonged to anyone.\n\n\"Do you want me to say thank you,\" O\u2019Brian asked, \"or something softer that can be mistaken for gratitude.\"\n\n\"Say you'll listen for once. We've got a thing that smells like your kind of thing, and I need it to start smelling like evidence before my boss assigns it to someone who spells 'imagination' with a ticket book.\"\n\n\"I will listen,\" she said, and left the sword turned to rumor and the disc turned to coin at her belt. \"What did you find.\"\n\nMendez led her not to a security office, which would have been too symbolic even for O\u2019Brian, but to a small room with a sink that had worked at one time and a computer that had not been updated since the word update first went into the world with swagger. On the desk lay a stack of reports in a file folder that had corralled unrelated lives for years. On the top was a photocopy of a handwritten sign-out log from the refrigerated morgue unit in the basement, and beside that was a note written in hospital pen on hospital paper that had the word audit on it in a hand that had never been taught that certain words should be printed and not written if a heart is to be reassured.\n\n\"Two nights ago,\" Mendez said, tapping the log with her finger the way you tap on a tank to see if the fish will remember you, \"the freezer tech on graveyard did the rounds, because he does them every two hours, because that is how you keep a job and also sleepwalk responsibly. He notes there that Unit 4B had a temperature fluctuation of three degrees. He checks the seals. He checks the doors\u2014still sealed. He checks the inventory sheet. Three toe tags match three bed positions. He logs it, resets, goes on. Next round, it's fine. Yesterday the audit sheet shows all in order. This morning, a nurse with a conscience that won't retire says she thinks she saw a child in a hall that doesn't have children in it. The time on her chart puts her there at one twelve in the morning. We pull the hallway camera, which points at a door that points at another door that points at the stairs, because nobody planned for curiosity when they had the budget. There's a sliver. A shadow where there shouldn't be one. You want to guess what inventory in 4B shows now.\"\n\n\"Tell me anyway,\" O\u2019Brian said, because in stories if you guess right you rob the other person of their bread.\n\n\"It shows one bed with no toe tag. It shows one missing record that should have been impossible to misplace. It shows a signature that my tech says is just his own, but it's wrong in a way that feels intentional to people who read the same line and write the same name a thousand times a day.\"\n\n\"Quinn,\" O\u2019Brian said, and she did not like the way it came out, as if it had been waiting in the room and needed to be confirmed to get paid.\n\n\"Don't do that to me,\" Mendez said, but the fight had been coached to sit this one out. \"We found no body, if there was a body. We found condensation on the inside of a latch, as if someone had breathed against it. The tech says he is sure he did not fall asleep. He says he is sure he did not daydream that he left a door exactly the way he found it. He says he is sure of all sorts of things, which is what people say when they have discovered the precise shape of their doubt.\"\n\n\"Does anyone take a child to a place where children are not supposed to be and then bring them back up a stair that is not on a map and do it all between one twelve and one twenty,\" O\u2019Brian asked. \"If you were writing this down, would you trust you had not become someone else.\"\n\n\"I would trust that I had started to make a small catalog of questions that are going to buy me a headache. The other thing,\" Mendez said, turning a second paper around, \"is that a name has come up in three different locations you have already bothered me about: a vendor who supplies portable refrigeration units, short-term rentals, cash deposit accepted. They have a warehouse just inside the city line, they have a second location that is a PO Box with a flag, and they have a third address in a strip of storage units that we do not call a strip mall because there is nothing funny beneath it. The paperwork shows a renter with a name that has been scrubbed three times. The last version says Quinn S. Quinn S is not a last name I am willing to arrest yet. The storage unit number, however, I will give you.\"\n\nO\u2019Brian did not touch the paper. She did not need to. She knew the number. She handed Mendez back the chips because sometimes a story requires an offering.\n\n\"Don't go alone,\" Mendez said, as if she had an agreement with the city that if she said certain phrases often enough, they would accrue on a ledger somewhere and be cashed in on a day the sun was forgiving. \"Don't go, period. Give me an afternoon. Give me a judge who remembers me with something like consent. I will call the warehouse first. I will do the stupid thing properly. You will not show up and point at a lock with a glow-stick.\"\n\n\"You make fun because the truth is unsettling,\" O\u2019Brian said, but there was affection in it because between them the affection had learned not to get itself killed. \"I will give you until the deli closes. The one with the angel in the window. When the sign says WE ARE CLOSING WHEN WE CLOSE and the owner flips it around because he has decided to be unambitious for once, I will go.\"\n\n\"You need a leash,\" Mendez said. \"You need a board and a cat and an afternoon that is not yours.\"\n\n\"I need to keep someone from being kept,\" O\u2019Brian said. \"Not with a hero speech. With whatever is left of me that can carry a small portion of quiet.\"\n\n\"You're worse before noon,\" Mendez said, not unkindly, and pushed the chips back toward her because ritual matters.\n\nThe warehouse lived in a part of town that had once been factories and was now memory foam for businesses that did not want to be remembered. You could smell old oil even in the rain, which meant you were smelling ghosts. The sign read MID-ATLANTIC COLD STORAGE in letters that had a sense of humor about the gap between their ambition and their budget. The clerk, a man whose hair had been betrayed by his hat and whose day had been betrayed by a pile of invoices, took one look at Mendez's badge and decided he was in favor of the rule of law, and then one look at O\u2019Brian and decided he was in favor of not asking just yet. He said he could not talk about clients without papers. He said he could, however, talk about generalities if someone would sign for this delivery that was going to be an hour late in the wrong direction.\n\n\"We're looking for a short-term rental paid in cash,\" Mendez said in the tone that had been able to negotiate with a vending machine. \"A name that has been mauled. A unit that has been kept under spec. We are not here to shut you down. We are here to ask whether you have ever seen a boy in your business who looks twelve and older than that in all the wrong places.\"\n\nThe clerk folded a hand towel with more attention than it deserved. He said that trucks came and went and that sometimes people hid things in cold because cold preserves lies. He said that last week a man who smelled of bleach without having worked for it rented a chest unit and returned it with the inside wiped three times and the outside dented in a way that suggested someone had loved it with their boot. He said he did not, however, see children because the only way to do this job was to decide that certain things were invisible. He wrote a number on a napkin and slid it across to Mendez with the same careful disdain you reserve for the weather. The number was not a unit number. It was a tag for a dolly that had been checked out after hours. He said the log for after hours lived in his head, and his head said that the tag had gone out at midnight and come back at four and that the person who signed the clipboard had written S. Quinn with confidence.\n\n\"Do you get deliveries to the storage branch,\" Mendez asked. \"On Edbrooke, the one that pretends it has a night watchman when all it has is a dog that belongs to no one.\"\n\nThe clerk said that company policy was to act surprised when they found out about the dog. He said the storage branch had a pad for trucks and a habit of staying quiet. He said he did not own keys to those units because a person should not keep doors in their pocket that do not belong to them. He used too many words to say, be careful, which is how men like him ask forgiveness for not being brave at a particular hour of the evening that no one else saw.\n\nThey left him with his towel and his invoices and his own conscience, which would call him later. Mendez drove because she had long since decided that she would rather be the one to discover the flaw than the one to be betrayed by it. In the passenger seat O\u2019Brian held the disc in her palm and watched it tilt light into shapes that made no effort to pretend to be maps. The crack in it always made the rainbow think about its own limits. She wanted to hold it up like the cards drunk men use to tell their pasts and futures. She wanted to throw it in the harbor and see if it would learn to float.\n\n\"We're not going in,\" Mendez said as if the car could be persuaded to obey ethics. \"We are going to drive past and make sure there is not a parade with a banner. We are going to consider that you might be wrong.\"\n\n\"I am wrong every day,\" O\u2019Brian said. \"The day I stop being wrong I will need new friends and a hobby that does not cost bail.\"\n\nThe storage units looked like a row of excuses. Each door was a confession, each lock a compromise. The fence wore razor wire like a haircut that had gone too far. The dog who did not belong to anyone stood up, scratched at an ear that had been faithful longer than any person, and showed no interest in them at all. There was no parade. There was nothing that wanted to be seen, which is usually how you know you have the right address. Mendez let the car roll past, then turned at the corner and stopped where a billboard for a furniture store promised what furniture stores have to promise in order to get chosen over a mattress on the floor.\n\n\"I meant what I said,\" she said, not turning her head. \"I will go get the papers. Do not practice being a lock. Practice being a citizen. Go home. Write down your theories. Chew on your sleeve. Cut pictures out of magazines and rearrange them until they make peace. Do not climb a fence with a light in your teeth and your sword in your bag like a line from a poem that gets kids hurt.\"\n\nO\u2019Brian watched the dog and calculated how many times a person had to throw a ball to earn exactly that level of indifference. She said she would go home. She said she would eat the other half of the breakfast sandwich before it learned shame. She said she would wait until the deli closed, because that was not a lie and it got Mendez what she needed, which was time. The detective did not kiss her on the forehead because they did not live in a play, but there was a feeling in the car that sometimes pretended to be that.\n\nShe did not go home at once. She walked instead under the railway overpass where the concrete argued with pigeons about the ownership of droppings and graffiti. She stood with her hand against the cold pillar and let the current examine her like a doctor who had discovered a symptom he had not expected in a patient who had already exceeded his expectations. The hum that had been personal all night adjusted, widened, became civic again. It swept through the mortuary levels of three hospitals and the backup generators of two power stations and the half-lit storefront where a barber practiced shapes with his scissors when no one watched. It touched the storage units and recoiled and tried again, which told her that someone had learned to braid a sound against her sound. It told her that Unit 97 had been opened and closed and opened again in the last day, and that what lived inside did not like light but did not fear it either, which made it worse.\n\nShe texted Dev because she had promised herself something foreign called honesty. She told him she was going to do a thing he would not approve and that if he wanted to prevent her he had two hours and three methods, all of them involving talking. He texted back an emoji with a face that did not exist when they were younger and then the words, you promised once to let me try to be brave, and then he said nothing else because he had a patient or a conscience or both. She put the phone in her pocket because she did not want to see it choose silence, and she walked back toward a day that had put its name on a door and waited for her to step in.\n\nThe deli sign flipped at three, not because business was done but because the owner had a nephew who could not be collected by anyone else. The angel in the window had adjusted its harp to a key that might be called minor if angels could be accused of such. She went up the stairs and put the sandwich in the refrigerator, then took it out again and ate the half she had promised and left the other half because it is good to have a reason to come home. She checked the sword and told it a joke it refused. She checked the disc and watched as the crack took a little more. She cut a strip of tape and placed it over the note that still lived in the freezer, because sometimes to disobey yourself properly you have to do the gesture of care as well.\n\nDusk returned with the smugness of a friend who has been told twice to leave and has made a bet about your boundaries with a stranger. O\u2019Brian took the back stairs so as not to have to admire herself in the gossip of the building. She walked the long way to the units because the long way sometimes makes the short way more articulate. She counted streetlights and steps and the number of times a bus sighed at a stop where no one waited. By the time she reached the fence the dog had gone wherever dogs go when they are assured that if something happens it will not involve a ball. She climbed without making a promise about being graceful. On the ground inside she crouched and sat for a minute because the human animal hears better with knees bent. There was not much to hear beyond the insect hum of electricity and the wet articulation of rain that had decided not to stop after all.\n\nShe went to Unit 97 and put her ear against it and wished she knew how to hear thermal differences the way a thermometer does. The disc at her hip pushed against her as if it wanted to be involved, and she set it flat against the door and watched the light spite itself and then curl in. The rainbow tried to find purchase on metal. It did not. She took out the key she did not have and the lock she did not own and introduced them using skills that had been taught by people who had wanted her to go to jail so that she would have proof she had lived. The lock decided to be reasonable, and the door decided to accept that reason the way a person accepts a favor and then remembers the cost.\n\nInside was the kind of cold that remembers your childhood and tries to decide if it liked you then. She did not flip the light because she did not want to change sides. Her eyes found shapes anyway. There were freezers, three chest-high and two tall that each wore magnets shaped like whatever had been nearest the clerk's hand when he had gone to buy cigarettes. There were shelves that held boxes labeled with someone else's code, which is to say that they were labeled as if they had been made to reassure a person from far away. There was a chair that no one sat in because to sit in a place like this is to admit that you could mistake it for a room. There was also a trailing cable that had been wrapped with care and wrapped again and should have been government-issued. The current in her blood turned its head like a dog who hears its name in another room.\n\nShe stood very still and allowed her own breath to answer questions posed by the air. The freezers hummed, and in their hum was a full paragraph. One said work. One said wait. One said listen. She went to the one that said listen and stood above it with her hand outstretched, the way you put your palm above a baby to feel for fever. The temperature on the external display declared competence. The lock declared arrogance. She placed the disc on the lid and watched the way it changed the light in the room just enough to make a thought think of another thought. The crack ran its thin smile across the surface as if to say, what do you think a map is.\n\nWhen she opened the lid, the smell that rose was not the smell of meat or chemicals or death. It was the smell of old paper that has learned the art of keeping its secrets. Inside were rows of what looked like cassette tapes until you looked again and saw that they were not cassettes but something homemade, small cartridges with spools wound with thin translucent thread that caught light like the inside of a shell. Each had a label in a hand that wanted to be neat and did not fully submit, and the labels were single words. NO. NO. NO. OCCASIONALLY NO, as if the writer had not wanted to be boring. There were also names. Not the names of doctors at first. The names of teachers, a mother, a woman who ran a thrift store. You could tell the age of the hand by the early labels, how they pressed too hard and lost confidence in the curve, and the later ones, where the N became sharp like a knife that knew what it could cut.\n\nShe did not reach in. She let the cold roll against the skin of her arms like a dare, and she closed the lid, and she went to the tall unit and opened it because if you are going to be hurt by something, it is good to look it in the mouth first. Inside the tall unit hung a schematic made of string and thumbtacks. It would have been silly anywhere else. Here it had the weight of a liturgy. Threads ran between pieces of paper that held dates and places, a stain where coffee had remembered itself to be unstable, a photograph of an alley that could have been any alley and a silhouette that could have been a person if you believed in silhouettes. In the center someone had pinned a child's school project, a circle cut from construction paper on which was pasted the outline of a snowflake. The snowflake had been labeled NOWHERE in a child's hand, then, later, in an adult\u2019s careful block, it had been relabeled NOW HERE.\n\nThe other chest freezers held more of the cartridges. One had inventory sheets so tidy they made your teeth ache. This one held names she knew. BISHARA. KAY. M. The ink had bled once when whoever labeled the tape had not waited for it to dry, and then had been corrected in a small careful way that told her that someone believed in being forgiven by handwriting. There was one cartridge whose label was a woven braid of letters: HARROW. The O bled into the W as if it had not wanted to end.\n\nShe did not take it, not yet. She took instead the one nearest it with no name and a time scrawled in a corner. She set it on the disc and watched the crack choose a side before remembering it had none. There was a small player built into the bottom shelf of the unit that held the cartridges. It had been made out of love and spite, which is how good machines come to be when a person builds them to make the world less powerful. She threaded the ribbon like you thread a body through a difficult request. The machine accepted its task. When it played there was not the sound of a voice the way you expect to hear a voice when you listen to a tape. There was a room. You could hear the size of it in the way the air answered itself. There was a chair complaining quietly. There was a person breathing who did not want to be accused of that. And then, across all that, there was the word no. Not shouted. Not even insisted upon. Said the way a doctor says it when a study has told her a truth she hates. O\u2019Brian wanted to say that it was Clare, but of course that is not how truth works. You do not get to be given what you want first try. The word had the husk of years in it. It drifted and then was gathered back up by the machine and turned into a unit, something you could keep, something you could tuck inside a story and use when you needed heat.\n\nShe played another at random, and this time the voice had laughter in it before the no as if the speaker had wanted to be generous. A child's voice somewhere said something that could have been the name of a toy or a plea to go outside. The no this time was the kind that saves lives. She listened to three more and then made herself stop because there are addictions you should introduce slowly or not at all. The current ran through the unit and through her and back out to the city as if it could not resist sharing the joke: he keeps the sound of refusal because he cannot see himself not being refused.\n\nThe chair in the corner told her that someone had sat here listening to these, for hours. The string-and-thumbtack snowflake told her that someone had tried to organize these into theology. The child\u2019s NOWHERE told her that somewhere along the line a boy had done what children do: used a pun to declare the conditions of his life without knowing he had made art. She put the cartridges back where they had been. She put her hand on the HARROW label without moving it because touch is sometimes a contract with your own restraint. The door to the unit made a small suggestion of closeness and then corrected itself. She felt the small click in her knees that meant fear had learned her bones.\n\nShe should have left it all and called Mendez and waited outside in the way that people who pass tests do. She took one cartridge and two photographs and the small child\u2019s snowflake and a roll of labels because sometimes the way to stop someone from keeping is to make a copy of the thing they did not expect anyone to understand. She closed the freezers with the carefulness of a person who had learned this ritual from opening doors in houses where the strong slept. She turned to step out and saw that the boy sat on the chair he had not sat on a minute before.\n\nHe was still twelve or near it. He was wearing a different T-shirt because maybe someone had taught him not to be seen in the same clothes two days in a row. He had the same hair. He had more rain on him than the room allowed. He was looking at her in the way you look at a story that you realize halfway through is going to take something away from you if you finish it. He did not seem afraid of her. He seemed afraid of the part of her that would repeat his name to herself on a day she needed to be brave.\n\n\"You shouldn't open refrigerators that don't belong to you,\" he said, and then swallowed because the sentence had come out as if he were quoting someone else and he wanted it to be his.\n\n\"You shouldn't keep things that don't belong to you,\" she said, and when she heard herself she realized she had used a grown-up voice against a child, which is a sin that carries its own echo.\n\n\"I didn't keep them,\" he said, and the fury he had been training leashed itself to that pronoun. \"He did. He keeps everything. He keeps my breath when I don't use it right. He keeps the way my mom said no when she stopped. He keeps the sound the nurse made when I told her I know what comes next. He keeps everything that isn't allowed. He says he keeps me safe that way because nothing can get to me if I'm already inside.\"\n\n\"If you're already inside what,\" she asked, and because he did not answer she answered herself, \"if you're inside someone else\u2019s idea of you.\"\n\n\"You think you can make me put it down,\" he said, and he was not talking about the cartridges. \"You think you can tell the story until it lets me go. You're the one who put it on me, aren't you. You're the one who saw a shadow and didn't ask what it was. You're the one who called me Quinn in a building where names stick to walls. Do you know what you do when you say a name under your breath near a door.\"\n\n\"You invite it in,\" she said, because she had learned that lesson sweating on a floor with a handful of salt and an old woman who had slapped her knuckles when she got the Latin wrong. \"I'm trying to invite you out.\"\n\n\"You can't get me out if I'm already here,\" he said, and he tapped his forehead with two fingers like a doctor diagnosing a patient he had not been allowed to touch. \"You can't stop what happened. You can stop telling me about it like you made it so you wouldn't have to live with not knowing how to live with it.\"\n\nHe stood from the chair not quickly but as if he had been sitting in a movie that asked too much of him and now he was leaving to find a smaller story. He went to the tall freezer and opened it with expert hands and took from a shelf a cartridge with a label that said TEACHER and he held it to his ear like it could warm him. He said that there was a night when the person who made this place made him listen to all the ways people say no until he could repeat them exactly, and then he said he did not want to be someone who could do that, and then he scowled because the confession had been extracted from him by a person he wished had not been in the room.\n\n\"Who is he,\" she asked, because even if she believed that he was in the way she told this, there had to be a person with hands and a history to go find and touch and ruin.\n\n\"Sometimes he's a man,\" the boy said. \"Sometimes he's a hallway. Sometimes he's the cold. Sometimes he's nowhere and now here. It depends on what you bring him. He likes doctors because they think they know where the edges are, and he likes people who say no because it means they had an edge to begin with. He doesn't like you. He doesn't like you because you got there first.\"\n\n\"At the hospital,\" she said. \"At Mercy. Outside. You were there.\"\n\n\"I am everywhere I can pretend to be,\" he said, and the pride in it scared both of them. \"If I don't go, he goes, and if he goes, I get left behind, and if I get left behind I get called something that isn't mine again.\"\n\n\"We should get you out of here,\" she said, and he smiled the smile of a child who has been taught by a lifetime of adults that you cannot be what you sound like.\n\n\"You should get yourself out of here,\" he said, and then he turned and ran his fingers along the label HARROW as if it were a candle he wanted to blow out and he did not dare. \"He doesn't think you're real. You're going to have to make him believe you when you tell him no, and you don't even like to hear yourself say it.\"\n\n\"I say no all the time,\" she said, too fast, too late, too injured by being overheard by a child.\n\n\"You say not yet,\" he said, and then he did the kindest thing, which was to look at her as if he had just realized she had done something hard once that had nothing to do with him. \"You need a word that isn't a word. You need a door that was a door once and became something else. Take the one with the stain on it,\" he said, and pointed to a cartridge whose label had been smudged by hands she trusted and distrusted in equal measures. \"Take the picture of the alley that isn't an alley. Take the snowflake because it will keep you warm if you don't think about it. Then leave it all, because if he comes back and finds you here he will make you a tape, and then you'll have to listen to it and you'll never say yes to anything again.\"\n\nHe stood and made to leave and then turned back and said thank you to the freezers like a person at a graveside who thanks the grass because there is nothing else to speak to. He moved toward the door and paused because he had learned that pauses increase safety. He said, without turning, that if she told the detective with the facts that she had been here, the detective would be angry, but that the detective would not make her choose between being right and being kind. He said there were men in uniforms who made choices easier and worse. He said that he would be in the places where things open when they shouldn't, just in case she wanted to see him when she was tired of her own voice.\n\nWhen he left the air adjusted to his absence as if it had been rewritten. O\u2019Brian felt her heart practicing a slower rhythm and decided to reward it by obeying. She put the cartridges and the snowflake in her bag and closed the freezers as if she had been taught by a good parent. She took nothing with a name. She took the roll of labels because sometimes to break a thing you have to be able to name it first. She relocked the door from the inside and let it latch and then did what she could from the outside to leave as little of herself on the metal as possible. She walked across the concrete without looking like running, because the dog had returned and dogs have opinions about prey. She climbed the fence more quietly because the light had shifted and people heard different things at different times of day, and she landed on the right side of the city again with a knee that wrote her a complaint that would be filed in a week when she slowed down.\n\nShe did not call Mendez yet because she wanted to put her hands on the thing she had stolen and make it answer before she could be asked to lose it to a ziplock bag. She went home the long way again and watched the hospital on the hill breathe, and she kept herself from touching its skin because she did not want it to tell her that she had been selfish. Upstairs the refrigerator had made a decision about its humming and the angel in the deli window had turned its head toward a rooster that someone had bought because they had thought irony could pay rent. She put the snowflake on the table that wanted to be a desk and set a glass on it as if to weigh it down, and she lined the photographs up like witnesses, and she threaded the stained cartridge into the machine because mercy sometimes means not making someone wait for a verdict.\n\nThe sound that came out was like standing at the back of a church when a choir warms up. There was movement and place and the kind of silence that has been trained. A woman spoke and it was not a no. It was a yes dragged over gravel. The word was, \"Okay,\" said through teeth that had already been set for no. Then, over that, a man's voice, polite, that old dangerous thing, asking her to repeat. The woman said no then, finally, and it was not a doctor voice, it was the voice of a person who has discovered that she still belongs to herself when asked to belong to someone else. There was a child in the room, a laugh, then not, then the small sound bodies make when cold insists without violence. She stopped the machine because she did not want to add to the soundtrack of anyone's refusal, and she sat with her hands on the table and thought about the sentence in the freezer that had not blurred, and she thought about the boy with the old wet hair, and she thought about the detective who had to go to a judge and say the words storage unit without making a face.\n\nThe phone buzzed. Dev, with a message typed as if he had been called away three times while writing it. He said, \"Lena called me. She found something in Clare's email that she didn't tell anyone because she thought it was spam. It's a shipping confirmation for a package that never arrived. The origin is a company I do not recognize. The destination is a PO Box at the storage strip. The contents are listed as spare parts. The note from the sender says, 'For when you change your mind.' I am tired, O\u2019Brian. I am tired of everything being a pun. I am going to have to go back into surgery and pretend I know what I am doing. Please do not do anything irreversible without letting me be angry first.\"\n\nShe told him she had done something that would require penance and that she had done it carefully. She told him that his anger would be accepted later with coffee and the second half of a sandwich. He sent back a period, which is how some people force themselves to be gentle. She dialed Mendez because to carry this alone would be to invent a god. She told her that she had been to the unit and that it contained what she had said however many days ago: a freezer where a story had been made. She said there were no bodies. She said there were voices. She said there was a photograph. She did not say she had taken anything because she did not want to be a suspect in the language the law speaks.\n\n\"We are at the court,\" Mendez said, tired in the way that steals years later. \"I am standing in a hallway that has decided to be its own echo. Tell me now whether I should jeopardize a thing I have climbed for by telling the judge that there's art in a freezer.\"\n\n\"It's not art,\" O\u2019Brian said, and then corrected herself because it was. \"It is that precise project your child brings home that makes you sit down because you did not know someone you love had this much control over scissors. It is a ledger of a hunger. It is all the no in a city collected and offered back to us as evidence that the city deserves it. It's what he keeps because he cannot see it. You can tell the judge there's a man who wants to own what people will not give him, and that he believes that if he keeps it he will not have to look anybody in the face.\"\n\n\"I can't tell a judge that,\" Mendez said, but she meant I will find a way to say something that lets me do what I need. \"Stay put. Put your light saber in the freezer next to your note. Keep your hands clean. When we go through that door, I don't want to have to arrest the only person in this circus who insists on using complete sentences.\"\n\n\"I will be here,\" O\u2019Brian said, and put the phone on the table with the snowflake and the photographs and the sound of a no heavy in a plastic box. The refrigerator hummed and she let herself love it for its stupidity and patience. She thought about her word. She thought about no and yes and okay dragged over gravel. She thought about the boy's grief masquerading as cleverness and about the way he had thanked the machines. She thought about the force\u2014the current, the shape under the hum that had led her here, and she realized that she had been following it as if it were a river with banks when in fact it had been behaving like light all along, bouncing off things, refusing to be held, showing her what she had not wanted to look at by illuminating everything around it until that thing stood out in relief.\n\nThe door to the hall rattled the way a door rattles when a neighbor closes another door down the line and the building shares that fact as gossip. She looked at the pencil palimpsest on her wall where she had attempted to erase a name and had failed. She wrote the name again, not to conjure it but to refuse to be ruled by the idea that not writing it gave it more power. The letters came out too careful, too square, a child's blocky pride in getting the lines straight, and she left them there because a wall with the truth written on it is, at the very least, a wall she could lean her shoulder against while the rest of the world rearranged itself without asking for permission.\n\nWhen evening tried its third costume in as many hours she took the disc and set it on the windowsill and turned the blade on in her mind and listened to the city tell itself that it would try again. She decided that when the door knocked tonight, whether it was Mendez with her papers or the boy with his patience or the cold itself asking for a cup of black coffee, she would open it and do the ordinary thing first: she would offer a chair, she would point to the window as if to say, look how the light behaves when refracted, tell me what it does for you, she would take her own advice and stop telling certain parts of the story out loud to see if the silence could be persuaded to loosen its grip. The glass of the window made a small sound a person might have called nothing, and after a day like this that felt like a promise she could live with until morning argued its case again.",

It hovered at the window like a person who had lost courage on the stoop. O\u2019Brian stood with her hand on the back of the chair she kept promising to replace and told herself not to answer as if the door were a verdict. When she opened it, Mendez was there with a paper in a plastic sleeve and a mouth set to the shape of a person who had practiced saying reasonable things in unreasonable rooms. Behind her, a younger officer with a haircut that had not yet learned to be modest held a box of evidence bags as if it were an infant.\n\n\u201cTell me it still exists,\u201d Mendez said, and the paper made the sound of a small metal thing that had been legally conjured out of stubborn air. \u201cTell me that when we get there, there will be a door, and when we open the door, it will not reveal a broom and a family of spiders who don\u2019t sign their leases.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt exists,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and it felt like cheating to say it without also saying what she had taken out of it and pressed onto her table as if to domesticate it. \u201cIt hums. It thinks it is a church for a god I don\u2019t like. The dog will not help or hinder, which is a kind of mercy I am willing to take.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you touch anything,\u201d Mendez asked, and the words came out like a kind of prayer that had opted out of grace.\n\n\u201cI looked,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and then, because lies taste worse before dinner, \u201cI took a piece of the story because stories behave in public and I am not above bribery. You can scold me later. We are short on a few kinds of time.\u201d\n\nMendez looked past her into the room without doing the impolite thing to a person\u2019s space. The angel in the window downstairs caught the streetlight and pretended to play something in a minor key. \u201cBring it,\u201d she said at last. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know about it I can\u2019t lose it. If I do know about it I can make a judge regret giving me this paper when he hears me talk about art in freezers. Either way, if you have put your fingerprints where they don\u2019t belong, let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s a better reason than your habit of adopting strays.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brian wrapped the stained cartridge and the two photographs in a dish towel that had been too honest for dishes. She slid the snowflake between the pages of a phone bill, and she held the cracked disc like she had paid for it with something she could not afford to regret. On the stairs, Mendez carried the weight of her own patience like a toolbox she had learned not to throw, and in the car the heater pretended that all breath is good breath if you share it in close quarters.\n\nThe storage facility\u2019s fence was the same, which is to say that it had decided to age with insolence. The dog was there, which is to say that time had learned his schedule and made the compromise called habit. Two uniformed officers peeled from a second car and fell into positions people learned from television and applied to the real. Mendez handed the warrant to the night manager, a man whose vest suggested he had once believed in an order that the world had coaxed him out of. He read the words the way you read something that will cost you a conversation later and not money, and he nodded as if to say that this was not the worst thing the building had witnessed.\n\n\u201cDo you have a unit number,\u201d he asked, not quite willing to be impressed that the city could still point at a specific door.\n\n\u201cNinety-seven,\u201d Mendez said. \u201cI need you to tell me you understand that this is a polite day and we would like to keep it that way.\u201d\n\nHe said he did, and he did the dance people do when paper meets lock. The bolt cutters like a joke with sharp teeth did their part, the officers held their breath as if oxygen were a thing you could bargain for, and the door rolled up in a kind of metal shrug. Cold breathed out again like an old friend pretending it had just arrived. The lights inside warmed reluctantly and remembered their job, and the units sat with their lids committed to their roles and their hums tuned to the key called habit.\n\nIt was both exactly as O\u2019Brian had left it and not, which is to say that this is how rooms get even with you for assuming their loyalty. The chair had been moved half an inch, the trailing cable coiled into a more honest circle, the magnets aligned with a neatness that had learned to pass. Mendez stepped in with that peculiar courtesy she extended to spaces she hated. She tasted the air and made a face that could be mistaken for disdain but was actually grief revised into pragmatism. She looked at O\u2019Brian and then at the tall unit, then at the chest freezers, then at the wall where someone had once hung nothing on purpose.\n\n\u201cWhat am I looking at,\u201d she said, not because she expected to like the answer but because naming is what law enforcement uses so as not to become religion.\n\n\u201cA record,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cA hoard of the sound people make when they refuse because they are trying to preserve themselves. A person who thinks keeping the sound is the same as being allowed to own the moment. If you open this one, you\u2019ll find a machinery any department would have trouble describing without someone making a joke to hide behind.\u201d\n\nThey did not open anything at first. They photographed, which is how you tell future strangers the truth of your evening. They bagged dust as if it were a witness. They wrote down the color of labels and the way the tape curled at the corners where the cold had gotten bored. Mendez had a way of making details understand they were now part of the public record, and as she moved around the space the room changed allegiance by degrees. When the tall unit\u2019s door opened, the string-and-thumbtack snowflake tugged like a memory and corrected itself. A younger officer jotted in a notebook as if writing could keep him from seeing what he would dream about later.\n\n\u201cWhat is this,\u201d he muttered, and Mendez touched his sleeve with two fingers, which is how she reminded people that they would need their nerves next week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how some people write their faith,\u201d she said, and then to O\u2019Brian, \u201cWhere are the bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t bodies,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cIf he has bodies, they\u2019re elsewhere, and likely alive, if he believes in the kind of keeping he\u2019s been practicing. He would rather have thresholds than endings. He wants to own an edge, not a consequence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen this is theft of something worse than an object,\u201d Mendez said, and it wasn\u2019t a question and it wasn\u2019t an absolution either. \u201cWe found traces of dry ice residue near the loading dock at Mercy, but we could tell ourselves endless stories about that. I need a name I can put on a line. I need a face that is not a reflection of everyone else\u2019s fear.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Brian did not say the name because she had learned that offering it here would be like chewing glass for attention. She moved to the unit that had said listen the first time and laid the dish towel down like a small flag and unwrapped the cartridge as if it were something alive that had agreed to be patient. Mendez watched her without pretending to be uninvested. The officers\u2019 shoulders squared up for a sound they did not know how to be true about. The machine made of love and spite accepted the ribbon with a small hiccup and then succumbed to purpose. The speakers whispered a room into existence, then sifted a breath, then placed a no on the table between them all like a coin that had gone through too many hands.\n\nThe younger officer made a soft surprised sound that he pretended he had not made. The night manager closed his eyes because sometimes what you were afraid of was less the content than the intent. Mendez\u2019s face did not move, which is how you see a person become a ledger. She stood there and allowed the sound to be the size it wanted and did not tell it to be smaller. She leaned down, looked at the labels in neat black and one bleeding blue, and placed a gloved fingertip near the one that had been smudged on purpose and said, \u201cYou need to tell me why that one matters more than the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s where someone tried to change a yes into a no and then back again,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cIt\u2019s a hinge. He thinks hinges are hearts. He thinks if he can understand the sound of one, he can stop doors from behaving like doors for anyone but him.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he the boy,\u201d Mendez asked, because she had seen enough ghosts to make a habit of not attributing everything to men in basements.\n\n\u201cHe is a boy when it suits him,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. \u201cHe is a hallway when it keeps him safe. He is the cold when he is convinced warmth is evidence. He has a face I have seen three times and would swear to, and a reflection I cannot hold onto, and a name that behaves like a switchblade.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have the lock,\u201d the older officer said, as if to contribute reason by demonstrating on smaller enemies. \u201cWe have these machines. We have the handwriting. Is there a truck? Is there a receipt at a gas station where someone asked to break a fifty and lingered long enough to make a suspect of himself?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a dolly tag with S. Quinn on it,\u201d Mendez said, and the name felt like she had lobbed it into a pool to see if it would float or sink. \u201cThere is a clerk who folds towels and will dream about us with shame. There is a dog who will not testify. There will be footprints we will pretend are intact. There is exactly enough to knock on a door and not enough to make that knock stick.\u201d\n\nThe hum in the room fattened. O\u2019Brian felt it the way a person feels a weather front through a scar. The freezers did not change temperature because that would have been too obvious even for them. The light adjusted its ambition. The youngest officer shivered without admitting that his blood had learned to tell stories. Out in the lot, something scraped, a small phonograph needle across the surface of a night. The dog did not speak because dogs are better at certain silences than priests.\n\nMendez watched O\u2019Brian as if to say this is the part where you announce trouble and I roll my eyes and then we dignify it together. What O\u2019Brian said instead was, \u201cHe wants to make me walk in alone,\u201d because it felt like treason to narrate the machine when the person stood right outside like a decision. \u201cHe will make something open that did not intend to. He will use the pun because it\u2019s the only magic he trusts. He will say nowhere and mean now here, and he will make the door agree.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we do not go through a door that can be made to agree with a pun,\u201d Mendez said, and if faith could clang, hers would have. \u201cWe stay in the room where my paper works. We do not go into the movie. We persuade the movie to come to us.\u201d\n\nThe scrape came again and found language. It was a latch persuading itself. It was an opening in a place that had not enjoyed such before. O\u2019Brian turned slowly because this was one of the few ways to negotiate with the theatrical. At the far wall, where the concrete had done its job without complaining two decades straight, a seam appeared because a person had decided to look right at it and lit it with a small stubborn will. The crack was not a crack; it was an invitation stubbornly misread. Frost wrote a parenthesis on its skin. The room did that thing rooms do when they wait to see if you will confirm their worst assumption about yourself.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Mendez said, and her hand was on the younger officer\u2019s sleeve now, rather than his arm, which is how you build a good habit where a person still remembers how to move. \u201cIf he wants her, he can want her in a space with witnesses. If he wants to make a poem out of a wall, he can do it while I name him into a record. You, stay. You, breathe. You, if you run, make it toward the front door and not into the next decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks you don\u2019t see him because you prefer the object to the story,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and she was looking at the seam with a soft pestering attention the seam could not stand. \u201cYou do see him. You see him so completely that he will stop believing he can invent you. Which is why he will take me, if he can. Which is why I would like to be rude to him while someone with a badge is writing it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you go through that, I can\u2019t write it down,\u201d Mendez said, and she said it as if she were explaining gravity, not asking a favor. \u201cIf you stay, I can turn this very stupid mythology into something that holds in a courtroom just long enough to keep him from breaking the next door in half. Choose my world or his. I won\u2019t forgive you twice in a week.\u201d She drew a slow line through the air with her finger, the way you tell a stray thought to heel. \u201cIf he wants to be now here, make him answer to it.\u201d\n\nThe seam did not vanish because you cannot embarrass a door with attention alone. It tried another trick. It made a smell arrive, something like peppermint scraped over steel. It made a sound shaped like the boy\u2019s cough. It put a shadow in the place where no shadow should be because the light had already filed a complaint. O\u2019Brian looked at the cracked disc in her hand and on impulse slid it into the seam the way you test the temperature of bathwater with your toe. The disc caught light and broke it up and offered it back in slices. The seam, which had been a sentence in a language the room did not admit to speaking, stuttered. It did not close. It did, however, stop behaving as if it were alone.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t bring a religious text,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and if her voice shook she convinced it to do so in time with the hum. \u201cI brought glass that breaks light into something less lonely. If he wants to step out of a pun, he\u2019ll have to fit through the color he pretends not to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say the strangest comforting things,\u201d Mendez said, and then she lifted her chin at the older officer, and he made an executive decision to be calm in a job that had taught him how not to be. \u201cWe\u2019re going to inventory an altar,\u201d she added, because sometimes you push back against the cinematic by being bureaucratic. \u201cWe\u2019re going to touch nothing until the camera says we did. We\u2019re going to let bad magic get bored.\u201d\n\nIt almost worked. Boredom is a kind of law that works on most forces that like to wear the shape of a boy. The seam didn\u2019t like being treated as paperwork. It opened because it resented the idea that it should not, and in the spill of cold came the echo of a hallway that had made itself a career. It did not show a corridor. It showed the idea of one, a geometry put on like a coat. There was ice that did not melt. There were rails like the ones O\u2019Brian had described beneath the city, which moved nothing but still remembered the motion. There was, most of all, a topology of off-limits, a bureaucracy of edges obsessed with itself.\n\nThe boy came as promised, because what else could he be if not terrible at staying entirely away. He leaned his shoulder against the air as if it had decided to be wall, and he looked at them with affront pulled fine. He was twelve, and he was older than anyone in that room. He saw the uniforms, and he saw Mendez, and he measured them all without visible malice. Then he saw the cracked disc wedged in the seam, and he smiled with pride the way a thief smiles when he sees a trick of his own done back to him with respect.\n\n\u201cYou made a window,\u201d he said, and he said it to O\u2019Brian but not only. \u201cDon\u2019t climb. Look.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want the person who keeps these records,\u201d Mendez said, and she surprised them all, including herself, by addressing the boy without any of the condescension that makes children think we deserve what happens to us. \u201cOr I want the name he uses when he buys boxes. You can dislike me and still tell me the thing that keeps the rest of us from being stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a name,\u201d the boy said, and he tilted his head and answered in sentences that seemed to cost him. \u201cHe\u2019s a door in a city that prefers windows. He\u2019s the argument you have with a stranger on a bus that you keep having with yourself when you get home. He\u2019s the person who stood at a desk and asked a woman to look at him while she signed a form that meant he could not be given what he had asked for, and she did not look because she had learned to live, and he decided if he could not have the eye he would have the sound. You can call him Quinn if you need to. He will not turn when you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he turn when you do,\u201d Mendez asked, and the officer with the haircut let the question move around him and see if it liked his edges.\n\n\u201cHe turns when I get cold enough,\u201d the boy said, and he glanced into the seam as if to gauge the weather. \u201cHe turns when I do what the labels say and pretend it makes me holy. He turns when I say no five hundred different ways and none of them make a dent in his face. He turns when I make a map out of strings and pretend I invented snow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen look at me,\u201d Mendez said, and she stepped to where the boy would have to look up slightly, which is how you disarm a child who has been addressed too often by people who have learned to loom. \u201cLook at me and tell me if you want me to take the room that hurts you away. Tell me if you want us to write it down until it loses its appetite. Tell me what you want us to do right now that is legal and still kind.\u201d\n\nThe boy did look. He did it properly, which is to say with caution and speed. His eyes were older than most languages. He looked and then looked away because it hurt, or because he had been trained to stop short of troubleshooting intimacy. He said that if she took the room away, he might have nowhere to go, and if she left it, he might not ever stop going there, and that either way he would be furious, which is an honest position for a child to take. He said he wanted the tapes to stop humming when he fell asleep. He said he wanted the doctors to come out and make the same jokes they always made when they were the tired kind of good. He said he wanted to know that the word no could mean see me and not only stop.\n\n\u201cThen we start with what we can reach,\u201d Mendez said, and the words lived swaddled in a temper she rarely let out where people could see it. \u201cWe catalog every thread and every label and every hum until a person paid to be bored says yes to me. We pull the manifests from the vendor with the tidy trucks. We talk to the night manager until he remembers if he has a nephew who lifts. We do the horrible slow thing that almost never works until we make it work out of spite. And you,\u201d she added, and now the officer with the haircut was both ears, \u201cdo not go through that opening because it has not applied for a permit. If you see a person on the other side, you call me a poet under your breath and then you talk about locks.\u201d\n\nThe boy snorted without humor, which is how relief sometimes arrives in a room like this. O\u2019Brian felt the seam change its mind, once, as if light had convinced it it wasn\u2019t special. She kept her hand on the disc until her fingers forgot the temperature, and she listened to the freezers whisper their mechanical faith while the officers made lists that would later be stapled to other lists. She thought of the snowflake pressed inside her phone bill and the way it had held words with equal accuracy and indifference. She remembered the way the stained tape had said okay like a person lowering themselves onto a bed they did not trust, and she thought that if there was an antidote it would not be found in arguing it would be found in repetition, a citizen's dull and stubborn reply to the theatrical demand.\n\nWhen the photographer arrived and set his tripod up like he was introducing a friend to a situation it might not like, the seam did something new. It rolled backward, not away but in, as if the hallway had yawned. A man stepped to the threshold as if he had forgotten this action was one of those things that, done with too much awareness, changes everything. He was not dramatic. He was clean in a way that suggested rage. His hands were careful, the care that comes from living next to instruments too long. He was the kind of ordinary that made memory fail to develop its film. His eyes were ordinary too until they weren\u2019t, until you saw that they were the color of a puddle that had oil floating on it. He was neither handsome nor ugly, which is how you win certain wars in public. He looked like what you get when you grind rejection and patience into a paste and spread it on a face.\n\n\u201cThis is a storage unit,\u201d he said, as if caught in the act of doing inventory, as if a handful of badges and a sword-shaped shadow and a boy with a rain halo were interruptions he could invoice. \u201cDo you have authorization to examine medical machinery not on hospital property. Does your jurisdiction extend to refrigeration under a certain cubic volume. Is there a distinction in your paper between property and loneliness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can start with your name,\u201d Mendez said, and you could hear in her voice the training that teaches you to treat monsters like landlords. \u201cWe have S. Quinn on a dolly tag. We have a man who rents in cash. We have a freezer that thinks it is a chapel. You can make my job easier by deciding to cooperate before I have to become unreasonable.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve taken something,\u201d he said, and he was looking at the towel on the unit as if it were a wound he could diagnose by its care. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it is, which is precious, but you have that problem where curiosity becomes sanctimony. It\u2019s a storage unit. It stores. I keep what is not allowed because I am tired of the permissions of polite society. This is the term of art: evidence of the negative.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou keep refusals,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and she did not move because teachers had taught her that nice animals can be startled into bad manners when you go for the obvious. \u201cYou keep the sound of no because you cannot keep a face. You want to be given what you weren\u2019t, and you think that collecting the answer is the same as earning the question. You took a doctor whose no was precise and then you promised her that if she held still long enough the door would not change her shape. You took the boy because he was too good at practicing. You think he is your alibi.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he is my guarantee,\u201d the man said, and he did not look at the boy because he could not afford to. \u201cHe stands between me and the lack of it. He says no before the world can. I bring him where the world tells me no most, and I perform a substitution. The tapes are sacred. They tell me where the edges are. The edges cannot be trusted. Therefore, I keep them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou talk like a surgeon who is afraid of eyes,\u201d Dev had said once about a different man, and O\u2019Brian filed that for later because it wanted to be useful. She looked at the way the man\u2019s shoulders lived an inch higher than kindness. She watched his hands hover exactly above contact, as if contact would involve contamination of a kind he could not launder. She thought of the storage unit as an organ, the tapes as a thrift-shop replacement for a nerve, the seam as a valve that believed it was a metaphor.\n\n\u201cWe have enough to bring you in today,\u201d Mendez said, and she said it with that steady court-ready nothing that makes a person hear his own heartbeat louder than the room. \u201cWe have more tomorrow. I don\u2019t need you to be embarrassed. I need you to be tired. You\u2019re going to pick your tiresome poison. You can make this a religious argument or you can make it a municipal one. My paper likes both languages.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need you to look at me,\u201d he said, but the please didn\u2019t arrive because he had never learned it. \u201cIf you look at me while I give you the refusal, it will change your life. You won\u2019t be able to do this job anymore. You will get softer where it hurts. You will know that when women and children and doctors say no they are performing an act, and acts are cons, and cons have counters, and counters can be purchased. Look.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at me,\u201d the boy said then, and the words had impatience braided with something kinder. \u201cHe is practicing on you. He will make you participate. He will make a tape of you and call it consent. He doesn\u2019t know the difference anymore and it doesn\u2019t matter because his hands will continue to be clean in all the visible places. Don\u2019t do it. Keep your spine formal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a sermon,\u201d Mendez said to the boy, almost distractedly, because she had found a rhythm that did not belong to the room. She kept her eyes not on the man\u2019s face but on the nearest label because labels lie less frequently than breath. \u201cAnd I am not here to have my life changed. I am here to change paperwork into events. Sir, you are under arrest for trespass on hospital grounds, possession of restricted equipment without license, unlawful removal of medical materials, and a suite of eventually. You can choose quiet or talkative. Either way, I will make the time. Put your hands where my day can see them.\u201d\n\nFor a second, the man did nothing because for men like him seconds were the currency. Then he learned how many he had left and did the thing all men do when time disappears. He made a mess. He moved toward the seam with the intention of making all this into proof that they couldn\u2019t hold him, to be both now here and nowhere. He had a remote in his hand because of course he had a remote in his hand. He had designed a machine that would turn his apparatus into a song so loud it would drown out the law. He pressed a button and something in the units sighed as a compressor might sigh when asked to cool a planet.\n\nThe lights did not go out because that would have been sentimental. They doubled down. The freezers changed notes and went low. The seam did its trick, opening wider, which is to say it stopped making a moral distinction and returned to geometry. The boy took one step back, then forward, then chose not to run, and O\u2019Brian realized in that motion that he had been practicing yes in the privacy of his impatience and it had been exhausting him.\n\nShe pulled the disc out of the seam as if stealing a spoon from a magician\u2019s mouth. She held it up and caught the room in it and turned the cracked face toward the man. The rainbow did not redeem anything. It did, however, occupy the space between them with a fact that could not be denied. He looked away and then back and then away again, because looking at what he had denied himself hurt. She said no, and she did not drag it over gravel. She said it the way people say stop at a curb with a stroller. She said it like a person who has discovered that a word can be both a boundary and a shelter.\n\nIt knocked something loose in the room that would not be fetched again. The man did not fall down. He stopped pretending he could continue. The remote ceased to be an instrument and became a piece of plastic he would have to explain later. The officers moved with an economy that comes with a good day ruined and made wrists into sentences. The seam contracted because the room had decided to be polite to law for a minute. The boy exhaled a laugh that attempted to be a cough because he had once decided that joy would make him a target and had forgotten how to unteach himself that.\n\nWhen the cuffs sang their dull song and the man\u2019s mouth learned how much he relied on it to be dangerous, Mendez leaned in the smallest amount and said, \u201cYou look at the ground if you need to. No one here wants to brand you with their eyes. You have the right to shut up and I suggest, as a woman with the capacity for kindness that I ration carefully, that you exercise it.\u201d She turned to the night manager and told him that sometimes the happiest a building gets is when a story that had made itself at home is evicted.\n\n\u201cWhat about the doctors,\u201d the younger officer asked, because the human need to be comforted by fact is a habit you should feed when possible. \u201cWhat about the one with the email and the one with the flyer and the one with a girlfriend who keeps plants instead of giving up. What about the boy. What do we do with him now that he is not a metaphor in your reports.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe follow the chain of cold,\u201d Mendez said, and she wasn\u2019t performing for anyone. \u201cWe find the offsite units and the warehouse on the line where city law forgets to be brave. We find the trucks with dented fenders that paid in cash and the receipts folded into glove compartments on the wrong side of town. We go to every hospital and ask the morgue technician to let us watch him lock the doors, and we go through the video three seconds at a time until the shadow makes the mistake of repeating itself. We ask people who don\u2019t like to be asked. We keep asking. We do the worst job and call it good work.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d the boy said, and there was a small rattling in the way he said it, as if a wheel had decided to stop pretending it had been round all along. \u201cDo you arrest me for being a hallway. Do you tell me to go home to a mother whose no didn\u2019t save me because she had to forget me in order to survive. Do you make me sit in a room and wait while you decide if I am an accessory to a kind of magic you cannot write down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou come with me,\u201d Mendez said, and the muscles in her cheek loosened their charade just enough for softness to get a breath in. \u201cNot as a thing. As a witness. As a child who has been doing a job he was not hired for. You sit in a place with a vending machine that will not withhold from you out of principle. You drink cocoa because that is the law in my section now. You answer what you want. You stay near. You do not disappear unless you have previously scheduled it with my secretary.\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded once as if he had been given a script in a language he appreciated for its refusal to be impressed with itself. He glanced at O\u2019Brian then and said, almost in apology, that he had been practicing no so long that yes made him feel like a traitor. She told him that he could be both things and still get bread. He said he did not like bread with holes in it because the holes were lies, and she promised him the deli downstairs favored loaves that were not aspirational.\n\nThey filed the man past the freezers on his way to becoming paperwork. He did not look back, which is how people who worship the idea that they are obligated to themselves excuse themselves from goodbye. The seam did finally what it always would have done without attention: it cooled into wall. The unit smelled like people now, and that was as fine an ending for an evening as any structure could ask. The night manager cried without noise into the towel he had folded with such care because it had suddenly remembered its first job.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to gloat,\u201d Mendez said to O\u2019Brian when the door rolled down and met the ground and became, as is its intention, a door. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to turn your head and show me that profile you work on when you think we\u2019re not looking. You\u2019re going to go home and sleep with your boots on and in the morning you\u2019re going to give me what you took without making me ask twice. You\u2019re going to be mean to yourself for a few minutes, because you enjoy the ritual, and then you\u2019re going to stop. You\u2019re going to let me do my job.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bad at letting,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and it felt good to tell the truth even if you intended to defect from it later. \u201cBut I can practice. I am not the only person in the city who has learned to rehearse the same word until it sounds like church.\u201d\n\nThey drove back through a town that had decided to allow itself streetlight again. The boy sat in the back with the officer with the haircut, who had decided to grow a conscience at a speed good policemen usually save for lectures. Mendez deposited him in a room that had a couch that smelled like all the things people had not said on it because they were worried about where the words might go. A woman with a loose sweater brought cocoa that tasted like a thin idea of chocolate and yet more sugar than any philosopher could recommend. Forms arrived because forms believe slowly in miracles. The boy signed nothing because he was not in the habit of cosigning other people\u2019s realities, but he answered questions that did not poke at his ribs and he asked for paper to draw a snowflake that looked either like the one he had made once and then lost or the inverse of it which is what you get when you finally admit that the same shape can mean more than one thing.\n\nDev called at midnight and his voice had the new fatigue that people wear when they are beginning something without meaning to. He said that he had looked at the shipping confirmations and found a route that pretended it did not exist, and he had called Lena and told her that she could break two plates if she wanted because that would be theater enough for the night. He said he did not forgive her for going in without him, and he did not need to because it was not his job and she would not accept or require it, and then he said that when this was over, which it would never be because these things are ecosystems and not events, he would like to sit at the deli and eat the thing with the bacon and argue about whether virtue deteriorates in contact with hunger. She told him she preferred to argue whether hunger improves virtue by making it less sure of itself, and he said he could perform both roles capably with sufficient coffee.\n\nAt home, the refrigerator greeted her with its stupid patience. She placed the cracked disc on the sill and did not sit near it because she had no interest in wearing a crown this evening. She took the snowflake out of the phone bill and pinned it to the wall with a thumbtack that had held up the photograph of a beach she had never been to and could describe anyway. She placed the stained tape in the freezer because it had proved itself a better container than metaphor, and she wrote a label in the neatness of a person applying to be forgiven and spelled the word hinge correctly the first try. She wrote QUINN on the wall, this time like a person filling out a form that does not understand how rich a name can be, and she drew a box around it not to imprison him but to keep the letters from making a run for it when she turned out the light.\n\nSleep arrived as if it owed her money and wanted to settle up quickly. It brought a dream that did not overextend itself: a hallway that had become bored with its own ability to manipulate space, a boy who asked if he could borrow yes for the afternoon and return it scuffed, a judge writing the word art on a form and pretending to be offended. In the morning, if morning was what we call the moment when light decides all this fuss is still worth it, she would take the cartridge to a woman with a lab and a sense of humor and she would tell Mendez what she had taken without inventing any extra poetry for the telling. She would buy bread without holes because the boy was correct on at least one point, and she would stand outside the hospital and listen to its breath and think, for once, not about no, not about yes, but about okay, and whether a city built of that word might one day stop collecting the opposite as if it had paid for anything with it.\n\nWhen light came, it did not come dramatically, because drama is for nights and their crimes. It arrived as a series of technical adjustments\u2014the window losing its interest in pretending to be a mirror, the coffee doing its lab work and coming out brown, the sound from the street moving up one register. She found on the inside of her door a note she had written to herself sometime between the third and fourth cup of yesterday and taped at eye level as if to remind a future uncooperative self of basic civics. It said, tell her the truth quickly. She took it down and put it in the bowl with the keys, and she carried her canvas bag to the deli because a person should not admit to having survived a night like that without buying something hot from someone who thinks he knows your name even when he\u2019s wrong.",

The owner slid her a cup with the lid already on because he did not like to watch good heat leave without a fight, and he put a paper bag on the counter that admitted by its warm weight that it had been filled by hands which had no illusions about how virtue survives. He said nothing about last night because men who have been in the same place long enough to be mistaken for furniture understand that questions can be instruments or kindness, and this morning his inventory leaned toward kindness. She said she had questions for the day and he told her to give him its name when she found it, then waved her out with a napkin the size of most apologies.\n\nThe street did that bureaucratic thing it does when it has to take attendance. Buses coughed at corners and waited while nobody sprinted for them, cars announced their loyalties by how they merged, pedestrians rehearsed walking without confessing to themselves that they were rehearsing their lives. O\u2019Brian let the current run its fingers through her like an aunt who does not ask permission before straightening a collar, and she let the hospital\u2019s breath reach her without demanding that it justify itself again. She texted Mendez a small drawing of a dog to say that she was up and possessed of bread and that this meant, by their present shared grammar, that she could be trusted for at least ten minutes. Mendez sent back an address for a lab that lived above a florist and below an argument about municipal zoning, along with the word hustle, which in her mouth meant please and in other mouths meant the practice of living.\n\nThe lab smelled like the inside of a guitar case. Ella, who ran it because someone had to and because she had decided that sweat and laughter were both instruments, was the sort of scientist whose hair did not obey gravity unless paid extra. She waved O\u2019Brian in with a pipette as a baton and glanced at the dish towel with its careful shape the way you look at a box brought inside by a child who has said it is a secret. When the cartridge sat on her table, it made that small sound of settlement people also make when they have finally found a chair that accepts them without training. The photographs she slid an inch away from the stain because even pictures deserve the courtesy of being asked if they mind what they sit next to.\n\n\u201cI will not ask you if you stole this,\u201d Ella said, setting the pipette down and selecting instead a pair of gloves that made a soft starched-moral sound when they bowed to her fingers. \u201cI will assume you borrowed it from a friend with bad habits and a freezer. I will also assume you want me to make it sing louder than it wants to without tearing it in half.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want the room it came from to stop thinking it is in charge,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and she tried to find a way to sit that did not look like a crime. \u201cI want the word on it to tell us more than it wants to. I want your machines to be kinder than the ones we met last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy machines are mean,\u201d Ella said, and there was pride and apology in equal acreage. \u201cBut they have good boundaries and they do not expect anyone to love them while they work. That makes them better than plenty of men. Leave it with me, and leave me the smell of where it came from because sometimes even electricity cares about context. You look like a person who needs vitamin D and a sun you can borrow. Go to your church. Watch your weird aquarium hospital. Don\u2019t start any fights I\u2019ll have to testify about.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll practice no,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and Ella\u2019s eyebrows made a small exclamation of solidarity that ended up looking like mercy.\n\nOutside, the florist\u2019s door had a sign hand-lettered to say that if you didn\u2019t see what you wanted you should ask, which is the essential lie even honest shops have to tell. The flowers arranged themselves like people at a party who had been told how many seconds to wait before initiating small talk. The rest of the block practiced being indifferent to all this and failed. She walked anyway, up toward the hill that now owned her mornings and her new confession that she had been wrong about where the city\u2019s loudest places were.\n\nDev was on his third coffee and had worn his smile down to court-mandated levels. He met her in a side corridor that had once been painted a dignified color and had learned instead to be a shade called promise-that-blackmails. He had the wet look of someone who has scrubbed and scrubbed and still carried home a day in the creases, and he had a pager that might as well have been an old lover who showed up unannounced and made demands he could not be rude to. He leaned his shoulder against a bulletin board that had long ago given up on displaying anything other than notices that had missed their dates, and he looked at her with the kind of affection that prefers to pretend it is cross.\n\n\u201cYou keep your bargains maybe eighteen minutes at a time,\u201d he said, and the words could have been a reprimand and came out as a truce. \u201cI was ready to be angry about last night, and then Mendez called me because she needed a list of things to ask me in terms her judge would like, and it is very hard to sustain indignation when you\u2019re making flashcards for justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can try again later,\u201d she said. \u201cAnger is a renewable resource if fed the right diet. This morning, I need you to tell me if you recognize the way someone writes down a shipment when the person has been taught to record things as if words were instruments.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are only so many fonts on Earth,\u201d he said, but there was interest now, and he took the photograph Ella had scanned and sent and peered at the neatness as if it thought too highly of itself. \u201cThe company is a shell with better stationary than morals. The hand is trying for clerical and not achieving it; the N leans left like a person who hates crowds. The note on the bottom is the kind a person writes when he wants to be kind but also wants to be obeyed. \u2018For when you change your mind\u2019 is the sort of thing a person who has never forgiven anyone says when he is attempting charm.\u201d\n\n\u201cLena found a confirmation for spare parts that never arrived,\u201d she said, and the current tapped her collarbone like a metronome that has decided being useful should not prevent it from being annoying. \u201cThe origin was the line between here and nowhere, and the destination was a box at the strip. If I asked you to stop being exactly who you are and come with me to the harbor, would you remind me that consenting adults can make terrible choices?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would ask if you brought food because the surgery schedule does not care about gallantry,\u201d he said, but his eyes had gone already to where the water would be if the hospital decided it had earned a view. \u201cI have two cases and a family who want me to lie gently. I can meet you at noon for eleven minutes. Text me the lie you want me to practice. I will tell you if it is anatomically possible.\u201d\n\nShe left him because leaving is one of the ways you say yes to a person you respect. The ER hummed behind her like a hive that can\u2019t decide if the queen is out or back, and the elevator offered her the daily sacrament of being forgiven for pressing the wrong button. Outside, the harbor\u2019s color had decided to be biblical again and then thought better of it and settled for municipal. The wind was in the mood to pry but not enough to be criminal, and gulls executed their long practice of being both anarchists and statisticians.\n\nThe address on Mendez\u2019s text lived down in the part of the waterfront where businesses go to practice wearing aliases. The building had its new name bolted over its old like a medal given to a soldier who did not enjoy being thanked, and the front office was staffed by a woman who had achieved that blessed state of employment in which rudeness reads as fidelity. She asked O\u2019Brian what she wanted in a voice that made it sound like a philosophical exercise, and she looked unimpressed when presented with city paper forwarded on a phone by a detective who believed in words the way other people believe in saints.\n\n\u201cWe can show you the dock log and the power bills,\u201d the woman said, and she did not get up to do it because she had trained paper to come to her. \u201cWe do not store bodies. We do not store art unless it is a fish that someone thinks is handsome. We store cold. If you want a romance, take a number and go to the movies.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you rent space to romances that wear lab coats,\u201d O\u2019Brian asked, and the woman allowed the corner of her mouth to attempt the experience of humor as if for continuing education credits. \u201cDo you have units with names that were once delivered to a PO Box that learned to hold its breath. Do your delivery men come back with stories about customers who breathe like chest freezers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we have,\u201d the woman said, thumbing through the ledger with the same bored reverence you offer hymnals, \u201cis a seasonal increase in shellfish and a set of small containers that go out at night with the kind of paper that declares that nothing in them is trying to be alive. We have a guy who tips in exact change and does not believe in eye contact. We have a driver who says he has a cousin at Mercy and that the cousin complains the way men who love their work complain. We have a blue truck with a dent like a memory and a recurring invoice paid in cash that spells Quinn like it wanted to be French.\u201d\n\nWhen Mendez walked in, the room corrected its posture. The badge, when deployed with her talent for treating veneration as an office hobby, changed the air pressure almost as much as the units did. She asked for the dock log and then for permission to be ungenerous. She asked which nights the blue truck came and whether the number on the side had learned to be ashamed, and the woman found herself telling the truth at the pace you do when you have not practiced that specific obedience in a year.\n\n\u201cHe was here two nights ago,\u201d the woman said, and she looked at the line in her ledger as if it had been unfaithful. \u201cHe took a portable and brought it back empty, which is not unheard of, but the way he did it was like he was in a hurry to apologize and wanted to be stopped. He wasn\u2019t. He wore gloves because he was in character. He smelled like peppermint and a bad decision. This is me being generous with the adjectives. You look like people who intend to ruin my evening with noble causes. Use the loading dock. Don\u2019t scuff the striping. Bring me back my bolt cutters if you borrow them.\u201d\n\nOut on the dock the wind had a new set of teeth and was practicing. The blue truck would arrive after dark because that was part of its contract with suspense, and neither woman had the budget for patience that long. Mendez had a plan that involved a second unit near the river mouth and a magistrate who had discovered late in life that subclauses are a way to flirt. She shook her head at the water as if it had canceled on her twice and turned toward the second address, which, like all addresses that matter, lived three blocks from where a map would suggest.\n\nThey drove through parts of the city that had been built out of optimism and paint and then had opted for function and a different kind of singing. The second unit sat inside a brick building pretending to be respectable. It had a roll-up door that wanted to retire and a padlock that had met better people. The knock did the thing knocks do when they do not expect to be answered, and when the door went up, the cold inside did not perform; it was just work.\n\nThis room had fewer pretensions than the one in the strip. It had boxes with the words spare parts printed on them with that cheery font manufacturers use when they are asking you to believe something without checking. It had a table where someone had left a checklist with only the boxes that say return marked with care. It had a tall aluminum cylinder on a dolly that might have been liquid nitrogen once and was now just ambition. It smelled like unwashed metal and the little sins of men who do not believe the places they rent will outlast them.\n\nMendez had a way she did silence that made other people talk. The man sweeping in the corner tried not to make eye contact and failed. He volunteered a small biography of the blue truck that included details about its appetite for fuel and its disdain for parking tickets. He volunteered that sometimes a kid came by with a ponytail and a hood up in a way meant to be a disguise and instead became a declaration. He volunteered that roofs leak in winter and that God was probably a landlord.\n\n\u201cWhere does your blue truck sleep,\u201d Mendez asked, and it was the sort of question that sounds like small talk and is in fact the opening statement of a charge. \u201cWhat do you tell yourself when you watch it go. Do you tell yourself that the world is large and your part small, or do you tell yourself that stories are like snow and if you stand still enough they will land on other people first.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sleeps behind Rizzo\u2019s bait shop,\u201d he said, and he did not look at O\u2019Brian because she was the kind of person whose attention made his heart flinch. \u201cHe likes the noise out there because it makes him feel like he\u2019s on the right side of a conversation. He likes the smell because it hides him from himself. He pays the kid in scratchers and calls him by a name that isn\u2019t his and the kid doesn\u2019t correct him, which is how you end up in the kind of trouble that looks good in a movie and ruins everybody for regular life.\u201d\n\nBait shops are churches for people who believe in repetition and statistics. Rizzo\u2019s had a bell on the door that had been pressed into service as a sleep aid and an open sign that had learned to be ironic. The blue truck had the dent as advertised, a throbbing bruise near the taillight that told the story of a day when someone had been looking at something else. Its back was locked, because theater insists on the lock even when it knows the protagonist knows how to make it irrelevant. Mendez shook her head, which served as her warrant to herself, and said they would return after they had performed the correct rituals. O\u2019Brian walked around the truck like a person saying goodbye to a stranger she had decided to like. The current reached for her and tripped and turned that stumble into a dance move and she agreed to be charmed.\n\nAt noon Dev texted eleven minutes exactly with a prayer-hands emoji he disapproved of conceptually. He met them at the bait shop and had a face that made people feel reassured because it looked like what currency would look like if it could get tired and still be reliable. He loaned his scrubs as legitimacy and addressed the truck in a voice that could have been used to coax a pancreas to behave. He pointed to a thing in the undercarriage that could be disconnected without violating any statute that would haunt a detective\u2019s career, and he said the best lies are the ones you could tell the truth about later if necessary. Mendez told him he was complicating her ethics in a way that would cost him coffee and he offered to pay up front.\n\nThey did not pop the lock that day because sometimes victory in a place like this looks like leaving a thing intact and watching who comes to touch it. They stationed unmarked cars with faces that did not fidget, and they found a bakery that sold bread without holes and put sugar on top of anything willing to wear it. The boy from the strip had been placed in a room at the station with a plant that had not yet been abandoned by city employees and had been given paper and a pencil and permission to be twelve in any way he could stand. He drew snowflakes and then cages for them and then erased the cages and then drew hands because he was more honest than the day and because the cocoa had made his fingers warm and this is how bodies declare the possibility of a future.\n\nWhen evening staged its daily coup, the blue truck woke. It did not expect to be observed because it was used to the kind of privacy that money buys when it is disguised as smallness. The driver had changed his hat and his mind twice before emerging, and he had the sort of posture that insists risk is a personal taste and he never liked salt anyway. The kid was there, not the boy with the rain hair but another kid who could be anyone if you weren\u2019t paying attention, and the kid got paid in scratchers again and did not look at the face of the man because he had been instructed by life to keep his eyes on the recipe.\n\nMendez did the thing good hunters do in urban settings: she used boredom as a weapon. She let the truck make the first error, which was to ignore a stop sign in front of a takeout where someone\u2019s grandmother was currently teaching the counterman how to remember names. She let it make the second error, which was to park with both tires on a line someone in high visibility had painted and meant to be obeyed. She let it make the third error, which was to be itself in public. Then she tapped the horn and the badges came and the truck\u2019s interior had to come to terms with its resume.\n\nInside were the markers of a small empire with poor taste. There were the racks and shelves you would expect, there were the seals that had not been kept faithful, there were empty slots that insisted they were not indictable. There was a smell like apologies lit on fire for show. There was a list taped to the inside door that someone had written in a hand pretending not to be fussy, and the list said pick up, drop, don\u2019t linger, don\u2019t be seen, which is the sort of thing people write when they have forgotten that lists are not charms. There was also a cooler with a custom lock and a plastic window the size of a book cover. Behind that, not pretending to be anything other than what it was, lay a person.\n\nShe was pale in the way people get pale when their blood has been asked to think about other things, and she breathed like someone who had made an arrangement with a machine and would like it honored. Her eyes were closed because the closed had been insisted upon, not because the body entirely agreed. There was a line taped to the inside corner of the cooler that led nowhere obvious, and there was a monitor shaped like a thrift store donation that permitted you to watch numbers act as if vigilance were the same thing as care. There was a toe tag because someone loved their own theatrical consistency, and on it, an initial and a last name someone had written while hating each letter, and it read ALVARADO, A.\n\nDev\u2019s face did the precise thing faces do when the part of the world they had decided to keep functioning decides to leave the room. He did not put his hands into a posture that would be confused with prayer. He put them to work dismantling a show, and he did it with a competence that has no music because it is too busy laying out instruments. He spoke softly to the woman not because he believed the body cared about tone but because he had learned that he does. He told her his name and the name of the hospital and the number of its doors. He told her the weather and the reason a detective would be in a bait shop. He told her someone loved her because he seemed like a man who had promised himself that whenever he got the chance to do that without lying he would take it.\n\nThe driver who had thought himself a decorous criminal looked like the moment a child realizes Monopoly money is insulted in other rooms. He said he had not known, that he had rented his integrity out by the hour with the same lack of reverence he brought to other rentals, that he had made the mistake of being small in a business that paid for large. He cried in a way that will always look self-flattering to people who have had to learn restraint, and he tried to direct the guilt away from himself by means of a story wherein he had been paid to be foolish and had assumed that foolishness has a law that protects it. Mendez told him his handcuffs would translate for him later and directed her attention to the cooler.\n\nIt is a particular kind of miracle when a person stirs not because you told them to but because the body is independent. Alvarado breathed in a new key, and the numbers on the thrift-store monitor debated their next rhetorical flourish, and Dev made the sort of noises that cause future prayers to be invented. The cooler had not been meant as an ark so much as a filing cabinet, but the body had decided to forgive it for being an accessory to survival. The lid took its time remembering it would be opened, and when it did there was a smell like paper that has taken on water and then learned to live anyway. Her eyelids fluttered with the frustration of beings that have to perform in order to convince the room they are real, and then opened, and the first thing they did was grab light and refuse to let go.\n\nO\u2019Brian stood with her palms flat against the nearest surface that was not a person and listened to the current change time signatures. She made herself look at the face on the toe tag and then at the face in the cooler, and she made herself hold those together because splitting them would have been a kindness with a cost. She did not say the name because names had a job and that job was to bind, and she could not afford to bind anyone to her right now. She thought of Lena and the plants and the pen left on the counter and the coat waiting for a shoulder that might forgive it for being abandoned. She thought about what the tapes had been stealing and what the man had believed he could purchase.\n\nThey moved Alvarado into the ambulance that had taken its time arriving because the city\u2019s resources had learned to triage with a cynicism that kept them moving. The EMTs did the special sacrament of speaking in numbers and forms and calling them facts so they would not break anything by naming it. Mendez went with them until the intersection where her jurisdiction turned into someone else\u2019s problem set and then stopped, as she had promised herself she would, because she had learned what it costs to be present at everything. She turned instead back to the bait shop, to the boy she did not have but had temporarily, to the unit with the string-and-thumbtack theology, to the idea of a man who had been arrested and now had to encounter the friction produced when a person is finally made to hold in his hand a version of himself the city can see.\n\nThe precinct had tried to be kind to the boy as instructed, which is to say they had put him in a room where the heat worked even if unsubtly, and they had not asked him the kind of questions that make adults feel like they are doing something while they are doing nothing. He had drawn and then fallen asleep on the couch like a person practicing consent. When he woke, he did not panic because there are ways the body knows how to be in rooms like this from long before we meet them. He looked around for the door as if it had recently turned into something else and then recognized Mendez and put his shoes back on with a neatness that would have made any grandmother bless his mother even if the grandmother had never met her.\n\n\u201cWe found one,\u201d Mendez said, and she did not name the doctor because she had learned from O\u2019Brian that you save certain doors for when you have more than one witness. \u201cShe is being rude to numbers as we speak. She is going to have opinions about how today goes. That means you have to have opinions about how your tonight goes. You can tell me to find you a place that is not a hallway. I am not the fairy godmother of city services, but I can call three people who owe me the kind of favor that burns slow and bright.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like rooms without chairs,\u201d he said, and the pencil in his hand disobeyed his grip briefly and rolled to the floor like a person saving a different person from saying something too brave. \u201cI don\u2019t like doors that have windows because it makes light dishonest. I don\u2019t like bread with holes because that means it cannot do the job it was taught. I don\u2019t know if I want a house that someone else thinks is the answer to a question they never asked me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a room where the thermostat does not live in a drawer,\u201d Mendez said, and she did not make a joke because jokes are for rooms that have already been made safe. \u201cYou want a phone that rings when you make it. You want to decide something small and watch as it stays decided. I have a foster placement three days old that has a dog with a personality and a rug with an embarrassing stain. They say yes to anonymity and no to saviors. You can try it and decide it is not for you without becoming a lesson for anyone else\u2019s blog.\u201d\n\nHe nodded like he had been given the word try and someone had told him it was not a contract but a window. He asked if he could bring his drawings and Mendez said only if he let the rug judge them. He asked if the dog would mind if he practiced saying no where it could hear him and Mendez said the dog believed in ritual if accompanied by biscuits. He asked if he could have the snowflake and O\u2019Brian put it in his hand without saying the word keep.\n\nThe man sat in an interview box with a table that had learned all the metaphors people had stapled to it and none of the jokes. He had requested a lawyer with the brittle politeness of someone used to getting service and then had decided to perform unrepresented until a person in a different suit told him to stop. He had very clean hands. He had a way of not blinking that would make a summer fly feel indicted. He had not offered his name because the name he liked did not belong to him and the one that did had not been used in any room that would flatter him. He said he collected artifacts. He said he could not be expected to suffer the city\u2019s hypocrisy when it came to which of its monsters were allowed to become museums. He said he did not like that the detective did not look at him because it violated a rule he had not written but expected everyone to follow.\n\nMendez listened at the exact speed necessary to make a man like that feel he had encountered an equal and an insult. She said the judge had signed three more papers and that his truck had fallen out of love with him in public. She said art, and he flinched because it was not his word and therefore threatened his belief that words are property. She said boy, and he did not flinch, which is its own confession. She said no and did not practice it, and his mouth made the small redrawing of itself you see when a poet is told to write a memo. She told him that sometimes the way you make a sound lose its magic is by writing it down until it becomes a line item. He told her she was a clerk of a dead god. She said clerks have better hours than wizards and got up to find a sandwich.\n\nOn the way out she passed Dev, who had come to tell them that Alvarado had become loudly alive in the way only doctors allowed to practice on themselves ethically can, and that she had said not okay once and then had taken inventory of her own bones as if they were borrowed and had declared half of them insufficient and the other half forgivable. He said he wanted to see the tapes in the morning if he could stand it and that he intended to be angry about all of this in a way that did not flatter him or anyone. He said he was going to take Lena to the plants because someone had to tell the greenery in careful tones what was going to happen next so it would not punish the apartment with a tantrum.\n\nThe apartment had remembered how to hold people when they were not sure about holding themselves. Lena looked like grief had been sewing in her and had run out of thread and was now waiting in line at a store. She hugged Dev the way people who do not practice hugging every day do it when it matters, and then she apologized for her hands and then kept them where they would do the least harm. The plants had taken their own counsel and decided to perform optimism in a way that would make anyone believe again in the science of light. When Dev told her what had been true for the last three hours, she made a sound he had not heard and would not forget, and then she did the thing you do in apartments like this because furniture has memory: she sat, she put her hand on the rug\u2019s embarrassing stain, and she said okay like a person unwrapping a medicine she does not trust.\n\n\u201cShe is not home and she is alive and she is in a building where rules still reprimand people,\u201d he said, and he watched her discover that her breath was a contract she could renegotiate after all. \u201cShe will be angry with numbers and gentle with anyone who asks her to be, and she will tell you she is sorry in ways that will make you and the plants both want to water something. We will hurt for the rest of this and then we will make habit out of whatever is left. If you want to break plates, I brought two from the doctors\u2019 lounge that deserve it.\u201d\n\nLena said she preferred to keep them out of spite, which was as healthy a decision as any on a day when an apology finally arrived like weather. She asked if she could go to the hospital and Dev said yes but slow. She asked if she should bring a coat and he said bring the one she loved because spite should be warmed. She asked if he would tell the stranger with the good ghost energy that she could come over and sit on the edge of a couch and say nothing and be listened to, and he said he would tell her and he suspected she would accept because she had trained herself to hear invitations even when spoken by rooms with plants.\n\nNight took its second shift without union representation. The city threw a dark blanket over itself that was not blanket and not dark but had learned that names are meant to be misleading. O\u2019Brian went home and opened the freezer as if it could have developed new moral positions while she was gone. The note she had taped to the inside still said what it said, and she did not tear it; she placed the cartridge labeled hinge beside the peas because some symbols last longer if fed cold as virtue. She turned the cracked disc in her hands until the rainbow exhausted itself and turned plain again, and she placed it by the window like a prayer you don\u2019t know how to ask and ask anyway. She took the glass sword out and held it because it purred in a key she had learned to hum under her breath, and she made herself laugh because laughter is one of the weapons that doesn't require a license.\n\nWhen sleep found her, it was a bureaucrat with an old briefcase. It asked her to sign three things and to initial next to the line that said she understood the risks of dreaming. She trusted none of it and agreed all the same. The dream did not try too hard because it had noticed the way she gets when ambition pretends to be art. It gave her a hallway that, for once, ended in a room with two chairs and a table and a window, and it gave her a boy who asked if he could have the chair that did not wobble because he had learned there is no age minimum on negotiating small mercies. It granted her a man who tried to say no and got interrupted by his own echo. It let her say okay and not die of it. It slid morning in between scenes so quietly she did not notice it had arrived until the radiator coughed in apology and the deli downstairs announced egg and bacon without asking her to deserve it.\n\nMorning had changed its mind about what sort of day it meant to be. It put a kind of grit in the wind that made men in suits consider sweaters; it put a shine on the pavement that reminded women who had been taught to survive snow how to read a sidewalk; it put a sound in the wires that suggested a transformer habit out back was preparing to audition for higher office. The text from Ella arrived like a bird landing, the simple declaration of a fact disguised as a small creature: you should come hear this, and bring your detective, and bring your priest if you\u2019ve got one, and bring your patience because I did a thing and now the thing is going to do a thing back.\n\nThe lab had grown new instruments overnight because machines reproduce when fed good gossip. The cartridge sat in a cradle that looked like a playground toy for adults, and the screen betrayed the fact that Ella had taught the waveforms manners with colored lines and gently scolding grids. She did not look at O\u2019Brian so much as aim her voice just to the left of her face, which is how certain kinds of colleagues respect the way certain kinds of mornings need to be.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the word,\u201d she said, and she tapped a part of the screen that had chosen to be more interesting. \u201cIt\u2019s everything that comes with it. He didn\u2019t keep a no; he kept a room. He kept the electricity\u2019s complaint, he kept the swing of the air, he kept what your body does when it aches and decides to pretend that is a conversation. He kept breath and then taught it to harmonize. I pulled the word out and it fought me. Underneath it, the woman says okay first, like she has to convince the syllable she is allowed to touch it. Underneath that, a child says a name that the machine cannot decide to hear because machines love to misunderstand tenderness. And here,\u201d she added, and pointed to a small insistence at the edge of the waveform, \u201cis a voice that is not a human voice at all, unless we are prepared to accept that the hum has evolved to speak. It says, as much as I can pretend to translate, now here. I don\u2019t know if this helps you in court. It helps me explain to myself why my electric bill has made a pass at me for the last month.\u201d\n\nMendez had taken a seat without giving the chair permission to betray it, and she did not blink at the now here because she had learned to treat certain phrases as wallpaper that can be acknowledged without surrendering the room. She asked if Ella could tell them where a tape had been recorded and Ella said that sometimes rooms leave their fingerprints wherever they go, and she could tell them that this one had the breath of a compressor that was very tired and the rhythm of a building that had learned to be upright in a neighborhood full of reasons to recline. She could tell them that the sound of a train was present not as train but as the absence a train leaves in the air when the tracks have been ripped up and the road put over the ghost. She could tell them that the power had flickered twice during the recording and then refused to admit it.\n\n\u201cTake it all,\u201d Ella said, and she said it like a person who had been rehearsing letting go with a professional. \u201cTake the graphs and the parts and the theory that will ruin the appetite of anyone who isn\u2019t made for this meal. I will write a paragraph that makes me sound like a machine who went to college, and then I will take a shower and audition for a second job making wind chimes. Do not let anyone unplug my patience while I am gone.\u201d\n\nThey took it because theft of a future requires good tools and a bad conscience, and they had both in enough balance to call it policy. On the way down the stairs, the florist handed O\u2019Brian a small plant with leaves that looked like decisions that went well, and said it was a housewarming gift for a person who had been disabused of the habit of being cold. O\u2019Brian took it and imagined the boy\u2019s foster rug and the dog\u2019s opinions and the way the plant would learn the vocabulary of a home that might, with coaxing, decide to be one.\n\nBy noon, the hospital had begun its new liturgy. Lena stood at the side of Alvarado\u2019s bed and rearranged the water cup and the blanket five times without changing either, and Dev stood at the foot and recited numbers as if they had the power of absolution. The current moved through the room like a curtain being adjusted without a hand, and O\u2019Brian took its measurement and then put her palm to the wall the way one friend touches another to confirm both are still present. Alvarado\u2019s eyes found her not because O\u2019Brian is remarkable but because bodies recognize habitats, and Alvarado gave an expression that said she had cataloged her gratitude and would deploy it when it would not humiliate her.\n\n\u201cDo you remember,\u201d O\u2019Brian asked, and she made sure the question was not a trap. \u201cDo you remember at all a room with a seam that turned into a door. Do you remember a man with clean hands and complicated sentences. Do you remember the moment you decided to say no until someone said okay, even if that someone was you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember peppermint,\u201d Alvarado said, and her voice had to be convinced ahead of time like a dog that hates carriers. \u201cAnd I remember a child\u2019s shape at the edge of something that wasn\u2019t a room. I remember promises that we would sleep and still be working. I remember deciding that if I had to be very good I would be very good at a different thing than the one he wanted. I remember the word now being used like a threat. I remember thinking that a freezer is just the absence of fire.\u201d\n\nOutside the door a volunteer dropped a stack of pamphlets titled Taking Control of Your Health and said sorry in a way that declared an allegiance to order. Mendez stepped out to let a nurse adjust a machine that had too much to say this hour, and O\u2019Brian stepped back because surrender is what separates priests from zealots. She went down to the lobby to stand by the aquarium and rehearse the fish\u2019s way of making efficiency look like elegance, and for once she allowed herself to consider that perhaps some small architecture had shifted. Not the city\u2014cities resent adjectives like healed and behave accordingly\u2014but the way she held it, the way it held her, the way the word no had been removed from a man\u2019s shrine and returned to the mouths of people who deserved to use it without someone keeping score.\n\nIn the aquarium the blue fish that had always made her think of someone\u2019s cufflink did a deliberate loop and considered her out of one eye. She said okay to it, because she was practicing, and it blew a set of small bubbles that constituted within their own faith tradition an answer. She turned and saw the boy standing near the pamphlets, looking as if he had been instructed to keep his hands in his pockets and had obeyed until he forgot why. He looked taller in this light, which is a thing light does for boys when it suspects they have been measuring themselves against walls that lie. He said the dog had tolerated him, which is as good as love in that species, and asked if the plant liked windows.\n\n\u201cIt will tell you,\u201d she said, and together they stood like two shapes temporarily forgiven by an institution that has modern art, compassion, and fluorescent lighting. \u201cThere are rules about water and rules about light and the rule that says you can write your name on the pot if you want. It\u2019s yours until it tells you that it belongs to a room instead.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if this was the first real contract anyone had offered him, and he didn\u2019t ask for her name because names in hospitals live in the mouths of other people. He told her that when he wakes up now there is a space where the tape used to hum and that space is the kind of silence that is polite. He said it frightened him because he had gotten good at one kind of noise and choosing another felt like betrayal. She told him betrayal can be a practice that matures into discretion, and he did not look impressed but he took the plant with a field marshal\u2019s seriousness and went back to his dog and his rug with measured steps.\n\nOn the courthouse steps, the judge who had signed and signed rubbed at his hand because he had recently remembered that muscles are muscles and that writing can make a man ache. He had been a public defender once and had promised himself that if he ever got the black robe he would become a machine that says yes to the right things, and now he sat and ate a pretzel that had learned to be warm inside regardless of weather. He recognized Mendez because the city had made a point of allowing them to be in each other\u2019s radius, and he said he did not enjoy being made a poet by the evidentiary standard. She told him she did not enjoy being made a magician by the chain of custody. They agreed to be adults about it for another day.\n\nNight would come again because that is what nights do, but it would not arrive to find the same arrangements in the same rooms. There would be units with their lids taped shut and a man who could no longer enter certain sentences without being patted down by paperwork. There would be a boy with a dog and a plant and a snowflake that had decided to stay unfrozen on a wall for a while. There would be a doctor whose name would be returned to her things and who would teach numbers to behave. There would be a detective who slept three hours and then woke with a list that did not look like despair because lists are insulted by that use. There would be a woman with a glass sword and a cracked disc who would set both down for a moment to drink the stupid coffee from her stupid refrigerator that she loved because it had kept humming through a sermon.\n\nSomewhere in a building that had been forgiven by its owners for being a building and not a promise, a seam would consider making an argument and decide the audience had found another show. The current would go on practicing scales through the pipes and the rails and the wires, because it is not its job to judge the content of the rooms it connects, only to keep insisting that they are not islands. And O\u2019Brian, who had decided, without telling anyone and without promising to keep the decision beyond lunch, that she would say okay whenever the city permitted it, would turn her face toward wind, and laugh once, and allow herself a small hope of an ordinary morning that did not belong to a metaphor.",

O\u2019Brian sat at her table-that-wanted-to-be-a-desk and watched the cracked disc tilt daylight into shapes that looked persuasive even before they were sentences. The sword leaned against the chair like a joke she refused to explain, and the snowflake pinned to the wall practiced belonging to paper instead of weather. The refrigerator, appointed to low office as parishioner and metronome, kept humming an amen that never quite closed. She drank coffee that tasted like persistence pressed through wire and read the small list she had only half meant to write before sleep: the ice plant by the rail, the Annex on the pier, the patient list Alvarado had whispered by way of apology to her own brain. The list leaned on a name she still had not said out loud to her own wall, because names were contracts and she had already signed too many without a lawyer.\n\nMendez texted the way a person knocks on a door they intend to enter regardless, which is to say by sending a photograph of a map folded the wrong way and the words I hope you like antiques. The map in picture form showed a neighborhood that had once been drawn as direction and had been repurposed as proof of funding. The blue line of the old spur rail ran behind a building that had no need of being proud, and beside it in a hand that believed in vowels too much was the word ICE. Two blocks away, as if the cartographer had become briefly romantic, a note read tunnel sealed 1987 in pencil that had been corrected twice and forgiven once. They met under a billboard that promised retirement with the same font as communion, and Mendez did not say be careful because they had learned to save the obvious for when they were afraid.\n\nThe ice plant had been considerate enough to age honestly. No bright murals apologized for industry, no artisan coffee stood in for thaw. Corrugated skin dull with old frost, windows that had chosen opacity as a creed, a chimney that would never again be allowed to intend smoke. The fence around it was the kind of maintenance that proves a budget, new chain link glinting like a drunken bracelet. A sign told them to call a number if they needed a permit and to call their mother if they needed forgiveness. Mendez held up paper that instructed doors to behave and, when they didn't, instructed the person with bolt cutters to assist. They slid in through a gap that had been a gift from a previous era of men who wanted somewhere to drink and be alone in a group.\n\nInside, the cold lingered the way a song lingers after you admit you liked it. It was not the killer kind, not this time. It was the kind that sits down on your bones and makes a case. Rooms led into more rooms without deciding between hall and factory, a bureaucratic flirtation with utility. A conveyor stood like a bridge to no island. The current inside her shook its head and then remembered to point. In a corner that had been designed not to be one, someone had recently made piles of recent things: crates to which labels clung as if labels could stop any motion that mattered, a pallet jack with a wheel that squealed as if to say it did not have a literary life, coils of cord that had learned to be patient. It had the smell that follows peppermint into rooms where bodies need a reason for being still, and under that the iron patience of old refrigeration, the coil and the fin and the wish to move heat without ever touching it.\n\nShe took the disc out, not as a shield, not exactly. The crack had widened itself into personality overnight, and when she tilted it the light obliged, performing but also telling the truth about the glass. Mendez placed a hand on her shoulder as if to weigh her anchor, and together they walked toward the place where the current insisted an argument had been staged. Windows punctured the cinderblock like a cluster of thoughts someone had tried to erase with a sleeve. Each pane wore a film where breath had lingered, fingerprints smudged and then wiped by a person who had been taught to tidy and had stopped just short of sterile. A table sat beneath and was not a table. It was a station, a bench, a lectern. On it lay angles of black glass like the masks you find in theaters built by engineers, each bordered with tape that had been written on in a small neat hand that would never be accused of art: north tunnel, drain, chapel, pedi east, Annex. The black panes were one-way if you wanted them to be. They were also something else if you had brought the wrong word and the right patience.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look and look,\u201d Mendez said under her breath, the way some people give grace before slicing bread. \u201cPretend you are the fish and the pane is the museum visitor.\u201d\n\nThe pane nearest O\u2019Brian caught her because she had come expecting catch. The reflection it offered was not her exactly. It was the shape you would sketch of her if you had refused to learn hands. Behind that, layered so thinly you could mistake it for smudge, was motion in a place that should not have allowed it. A stairwell she recognized because the paint had peeled in a shape like a state she had failed in fifth grade, but the stairwell was here and not here, because the pane wanted to be a map and a trap both. Another pane held an alley that had decided to be a room for the night. Another presented the fluorescent insistence of a corridor whose doors had learned the bored dignity of clinics after nine. The captions made a geometry that didn\u2019t ask for consent. She traced them with a finger in the air instead of touch because the air had less jurisdiction.\n\nThe current, in her, through her, around her, leaned in like an aunt and said: eyes. She remembered the boy\u2019s flinch when she had asked if someone kept his eyes and how a fury had risen under his skin that had not known where to sit. This was where it sat. These were sight-harvesting things, not cameras exactly, not mirrors in the generous old bargain sense wherein you see yourself and understand an arrangement of light. These were panes that took the act of looking from one place and sent it to another place until the person doing the looking became irrelevant. The person collecting the looks had built for themselves a chapel of surveillance that would not need people to serve it in pews, only in passing.\n\n\u201cInventory,\u201d Mendez said, because she had invented a ritual that repelled the theatrical. The pen in her hand made a heroic sound against paper as it cataloged. \u201cPanels, six. Labels, five legible, one smear. Cords, coiled in a way that suggests better training than ethics. Smell, peppermint and iron. Dust, insufficient to comfort me. Get me the angles. Get me the measurements. Get me a story about how someone stands here and pretends they are a neighbor and not a thief.\u201d\n\nThey set the disc on the table and the light obeyed it. The panes grew uncommitted, as if a teacher had walked into a classroom and the maps on the wall had decided that geography could wait. Behind one, for a blink, O\u2019Brian saw the faint edge of a sleeve she knew by the way the cuff had been rolled. The photograph in Lena\u2019s letter had not been of a sleeve, but you could infer a sleeve from the tilt of a wrist. She inhaled and the room became a room again. Mendez\u2019s pen became a baton. Somewhere deeper, a compressor sighed the way a person does when the word rest is not grossly out of reach.\n\nQuinn announced himself by standing where he wasn\u2019t expected to be and making it look like he had been hired. He slipped in from a shadow that had been a door in a previous decade and had learned how to argue with hardware. Twelve or near it, the hair a little shorter because someone in a foster kitchen had kissed scissors and felt brave, a sweatshirt with a logo earned in a fluorescent aisle and made dignified by stubbornness. He nodded to the panes as if they were peers he disapproved of. He nodded to Mendez as if she were a lesson he had decided to accept the first time. He nodded to O\u2019Brian and for a second looked like he would smile and then chose another language.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to open them to be opened by them,\u201d he said, and he said it as someone offering and not as someone hoarding. \u201cThey collect it even when you label them wrong. He wrote chapel because he got tired of being wrong about that word. He wrote drain because it made him feel like an engineer. He wrote Annex because he likes naming things what they are not. If you tilt one toward your face you might end up seeing the parts of you that you outsource to afternoons.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do they take,\u201d Mendez asked him, and she asked the way you would ask a paramedic whether a joint should be moved.\n\n\u201cThey take the direction the eyes go, not the eyes,\u201d he said, and he looked at his shoes for the space of a word. \u201cThe looking. So someone can stand elsewhere and make you feel looked at or not looked at and you don\u2019t know which is worse for you. He told me you can make a person tell the truth by making them aware that they are watched. He told me boys like me are honest in only two circumstances and both involve spectators. He was wrong. But he built this to prove that he was right. That\u2019s what men do when thinking feels a lot like losing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pronoun,\u201d Mendez said, and she had developed, in the way good lawyers develop a spinal reflex, an ear for ownership. \u201cWe got one in cuffs who thinks clean hands are theology. Do we have another one under a different theology entirely.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks he is the building,\u201d Quinn said, and he pointed with his chin because pointing with your hand at this many panes felt like blasphemy depending on the sanctuary. \u201cNot the clean hands. The other he. He doesn\u2019t like being a person because it makes doctors not look at him while they help him. He likes being a seam because seams exist even when nobody blesses them. He likes being now here and he likes being nowhere and he has trained himself to believe those are the same place. You won\u2019t arrest him. You will make him lonely and he will move. He will use a different word. He will choose a different angle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat angles are left,\u201d O\u2019Brian asked, because somewhere between the hum in her refrigerator and the hum in this plant she had learned that asking the tired child the hardest question sometimes refuses to break him in half.\n\n\u201cThe one where you look at yourself on purpose,\u201d he said, and he shifted his weight in a way that admitted how much he had been taught to measure his own presence. \u201cWhich is rude. Which is what you should do. He will hate it because it will make everything he took ordinary.\u201d\n\nOrdinary is a spell that is underused in rooms that insist on worship. O\u2019Brian tried it. She did an ugly thing. She put her face close to the pane labeled pedi east and she looked, not at a staircase or an alley or a seam, but at herself. Her face, her scar, the tired question protected by one more layer of joke than she could bear to keep tidy in public. The pane did not know what to do with her if she refused to be a corridor, so it did an honest thing and showed her the fluorescent bar, the flecked tile, the tired tackboard, and in the corner of a corner, in a way that would have made an intern curse because nothing was ever centered in this place, a coat on a hook that had not been claimed because the person who owned it had been encouraged to believe she had no claim on any space which a hook occupies.\n\n\u201cI know that coat,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and the words landed without dancing. \u201cLena knows that coat. It\u2019s a dark blue with a betrayal at the hem fixed with a thread color too proud for the job. He didn\u2019t steal it. He left it to be proof of leaving. He likes puns. He made an exhibit out of it and pretended not to be an artist because artists confess by accident. And the Annex,\u201d she added, and turned to the panel labeled Annex, because the one which says drain will never give you what you can drink. \u201cWhere.\u201d\n\nThe light in the pane that had been labeled Annex was bad in a generous way, washed from overhead and ashamed. It caught a stripe of water and long concrete that the harbor recognizes as a kind of devotion. A roll-up door born to resent itself had an orange stenciled P near the latch, and to the left of the door a man had hung a bell no one was meant to ring. Under the bell, a bronze plate that had no patience for plaque gave a number that used to be an address when the building still sent and received letters. It was the number Mendez had texted two days ago and then not followed because procedure asked her not to be clairvoyant in a way that would be punished later. It was the same number on a slip of paper at Lena\u2019s, in a confirmation about spare parts that never arrived, with a note that said for when you change your mind and meant, if you lose your nerve, I will keep it for you for a while.\n\nThe plant had another level, and the corridor to it had learned how to lie about the number of steps required. The compressor rooms in the underbelly had been refit to be storage for someone who believed in climate control the way men believe in generosity when they need to get elected. There was a door that had been painted the color of compliance and another door that had learned not to want attention. The seam in the second door had a memory of being a seam somewhere else and, upon being asked, performed. Not the dramatic peel-back from a television show that wants an eye; it did the small practical thing of admitting an error in measurement and offering a half-inch. That half-inch became politics. Mendez knelt, as if to communicate dignity to the bottom of her back, and listened. The sound on the other side was not a room but a person, not breath exactly but a body negotiating with space. The odor was not death and not hospital; it was paper that had decided it could be flesh with enough time in cold.\n\nQuinn stayed behind because he had learned through embarrassing trial that not all doors require witnesses who hate being tall. He sat at the table and lined up the labels the way a child lines up toy cars and argued a case for each: this one is lying, this one is confessing, this one is not yet done learning. He pulled the disc to him and breathed at its edge because as long as he practiced the skills he wanted and not the ones he had earned the city would remain negotiable. He said to the panes what you say to dogs in storms; stay. He could not be both hallway and boy and he had chosen boy for this minute, which is as honest a victory as the morning had asked from anyone.\n\nBehind the door that had been a seam and then a trial was a space that had a bureaucrat\u2019s idea of cozy. It had a cot with a blanket that apologized for being flammable. It had a chair that had endured the punishments of someone practicing sitting without permission. It had a small heater with a cord that would have bought a lecture from any uncle, and it had a bucket because men who build sanctuaries for themselves believe plumbing is a confession. It also had evidence of a person twice and then three times. A pen, an old friend of a pen, cheap brand, tidy line, the kind of tool doctors use when they have forgone the gift of fountain pens out of respect for reusability and for the way ballpoint forgives an angle. A list of three things on hospital paper, two crossed off in a hand that had not meant to be accomplishable and had been anyway. And the coat, blue with a hem stitched in a thread too proud, hanging on a nail as if it had been put there by someone who needed to keep their hands busy while trying not to revise a memory.\n\n\u201cClare,\u201d O\u2019Brian said without speaking the name and then spoke it because she had learned that the wall would not stop being the wall until she declared herself to it. \u201cClare.\u201d\n\nThe body in the cot moved in the particular way soles move when they have been cold too long and are deciding to forgive a future for offering shoes. She did not sit up dramatically because she was not that sort of person. She did the thing that nurses taught patients, and doctors forget, which is to evaluate the condition of a room against the plot of a day. She put her hand to her head and found hair and attached it to a timeline and found her way to an elbow and then to sitting that did not make anything worse. Her eyes opened knowing that there would be a test. They were the kind of brown that admits to being varieties in different light. She looked at Mendez first because an animal knows which person the room believes is in charge. She looked at O\u2019Brian next because an animal knows which person the room believes will misbehave and get away with it. She looked at the door last and refused to give it any ceremony at all.\n\n\u201cYou talk like a priest and a lunatic,\u201d she said, and the relief in it made the sentence stick to the air. \u201cWhere have you been.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been learning to say okay,\u201d O\u2019Brian said, and she tried not to perform the smile that wanted to be a defense. \u201cYou left your pen everywhere but here and that made a line that was easy to follow. Dev is going to remove me from the roster of your friends if I don\u2019t bring you to him immediately. Mendez will make it legal to drag this building into a courtroom for its interior decorating later. The boy says your coat misses you. I am prepared to be very good at being in the way for the next hour.\u201d\n\nClare stood with a kind of obedience that disguised itself as luck. She bent to the list and let her fingers rest on the two crossed items, and there was a tremor that had nothing to do with the cold. The third thing read call Lena and the line beside it had refused to choose a fate. She swallowed. It was a thing bodies still do in the presence of hope\u2019s price. She put the coat on not because the coat would warm her but because it would make her legs recall a task. She picked up the pen because we hold on to our roles when our rooms change. She did not ask about the man with clean hands. She did not ask about the boy. She did not ask about the panes. She asked, \u201cDo you have any water,\u201d and Mendez handed her a bottle the city had paid for by tricking itself into thinking hydration is cheaper than fire.\n\nTwo officers did polite miracles and made the door remember its job. The corridor forgot to be seam for as long as it takes to argue about overtime in a van. Quinn met them at the table, his hands politely elsewhere, the disc with its crack willing to travel. He did not look at Clare the way a myth looks at a trophy and tries to take its own picture. He looked at her with the double speed of a boy and a person who knows that some adults have learned to behave like rooms. She looked at him as if he were someone\u2019s nephew left too long in an office on a holiday. She said, \u201cYou are the person the man thinks is keeping him safe,\u201d and his mouth did a small strange thing that might one day mature into a smile he could use against his enemies.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the person who keeps practicing until a door finds a hobby,\u201d he said, and she nodded because she had been inside the kind of conference where men like to hear their own obedience spoken back to them.\n\nThey took the panes into custody, which was like arresting a collection plate. They photographed the table that had been an altar and the labels that had been liturgy and the cords that had been the spiderweb by which a woman\u2019s face could be moved across town without her consent. They packed the coated morning and the heater and the bucket into evidence as if any of those things had jurisdiction over meaning. Mendez put on her detective face, the one that declared she would testify later and look bored. She passed the coat as if it could be ceremonial, and it refused to be a symbol and became a garment, which is what a better class of metaphor always aspires to.\n\nThe Annex at the pier did not appreciate being surprised. The bell no one was meant to ring made a small disloyal sound when O\u2019Brian touched it with a knuckle, like an apology it had been keeping as petty cash. The roll-up door decided it would obey a piece of paper out of superstition and also because the mechanism had been left too long without grease and was embarrassed. Inside, the cold had not been taught humility. This annex was the clean place the plant had not tried to be. Seals in lines, corners apologizing by right angle for existing at all. A small office with a bubbling coffee maker that had learned to taste like repentance. A second room with a long table and a long window on which someone had drawn with a finger a shape that remembers snow only as structure. On the table, an inventory with columns named differently than anyone who had served in a war naming would have chosen. The word yeah lived in a margin in handwriting that did not belong in a ledger. The warehouse calendar had days crossed with a kind of manic fidelity that told you either nothing happened here or too much did and someone had to make a choice. There was a cooler, smaller than the truck\u2019s, improvised in the way good men improvise and bad men plagiarize. Inside, not a woman and not a boy, but a bundle of lenses and frames like a thrift store had tried to bury its best stock in ice. O\u2019Brian touched one with a fingertip and caught a tenderness that did not belong to her. Clare\u2019s glasses had been an act of small faith. These were other people\u2019s faiths, collected, poverty-struck, prescription guessed by men who liked pretending to be surgeons in everything but the part where they asked for consent.\n\n\u201cWe have a policy now,\u201d Mendez said, and the sentence had the tired authority of a woman who has made policy by momentum. \u201cWe take. We catalog. We ruin someone\u2019s filing system and call that justice. And we ask you what\u2019s missing, Dr. Harrow, if that is still a name you approve of belonging to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s missing is a conversation that would have been small enough to survive a winter,\u201d Clare said. She ran her finger along the frames the way a person touches old pews in a church that did not ask for her vote. \u201cWhat\u2019s missing is a place to put things that isn\u2019t a list. What\u2019s missing is Lena\u2019s patience and a plant that handles light badly and a dog that does not belong to either of us and will forgive us for this anyway. What is missing is mine to take back, or to set down.\u201d\n\nThe building had other rooms, because of course it did. Not a maze, exactly; a taxonomy. Refrigeration with labels like values. Freezer with labels like boundaries. Drawer with labels like names and then redacted in the legal conceit that redaction erases rather than decorates. In a drawer without zealotry they found a folder that held three receipts made opaque by a machine that hummed like a referee. On the copy line the gray above the letters read mid-atlantic cold, the way a person lowers their voice when they want to go unnoticed without being discovered to be shy. On the line for contents, spare parts in a careful hand that hated lying and did it anyway. On the line for note, the phrase for when you change your mind, again and again, written with an increasing confidence that makes a good prosecutor lazy. Beneath the receipts, a business card for a company called PARALLAX, a name someone at a desk had been unreasonably proud of. On the back, a single dried drop of coffee and the hand that did not quite know what to do with capital Qs had written harrow in lower case.\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t have mattered, the letter size, the case, the flourish or the economy. O\u2019Brian felt her own nervous system pull in like a tide. A letter\u2019s curve is a door. A door\u2019s curve is a sentence. This one had been made by the hand that had hung a coat and had made a list and had written not just notes but stories and had been punished for both. Handwriting keeps no secrets from people who have taught themselves to care.\n\nBefore the day got its other set of teeth and rained them down on the part of town that had invested in umbrellas, they took what they could and promised the rest a formal repentance. They put Clare in the back of a car in a way that made the car wish it were a chariot and drove her not toward home because home had a mouth too full of plants and regrets for that hour. They drove her to the hospital with the long doors. Dev met them with the kind of smile you put between yourself and instrument trays. He did not touch Clare the way movie doctors touch, like they have invented a new reason for skin. He touched the way people educated by the elderly touch\u2014brief, single-contact, plain. He said hello as a substitute for a hundred synonyms of relief, and he looked at O\u2019Brian exactly once and did not say anything because they had invented a kind of truce that is only valid when the eyes remain complicated.\n\nIf grief had had a stand-in, it would have sat in a chair in Lena\u2019s apartment and practiced saying sarcasm with a gentle accent. That stand-in was not needed. Lena did it herself. She stood on the threshold of the hospital room that smelled like competence and annoying generosity and she did not cross until invited, not because she was a coward or because she worshipped ceremony but because she had learned that an entrance changes the air. Clare looked up and the air did indeed change, but not the way theater teaches. It changed the way kitchens change when someone returns from walking the dog\u2014small, good, repeating. The plants in Lena\u2019s apartment found themselves included in a conversation three miles away and adjusted their leaves accordingly. The favorite pen lived for a while in a cup by a bed that had consented to be a bed only because some lawyer had convinced it that this counted as doing good and would get it out of a tax. Numbers were spoken, a nurse adjusted the angle of a pillow with more mastery than a general and zero patience for applause, and a plan was made that would look to outsiders like dithering and to practitioners like refusing to commit the sin of ambition.\n\nAt the Annex, as the sign on the pier winked at weather it could not outlast, a woman older than the clean-hands man and young enough to belong to a different club of sins stood in an office with a coffee smell and wrote a note. She wore neither villainy nor redemption. She had a ledger balanced in the place where some people keep their reasons. She spoke on a phone to a person who owned more words than she did and said phrases like chain of custody that had been forced on her as vocabulary by a week gone wrong. She did not use the word conscience. She wrote for when you change your mind on a sticker and frowned because the slogan had picked up connotations she had not budgeted for. She did not think of herself as he or she. She thought of herself as we. She would, that evening, call a lawyer who had known love once and ask what it costs to change the name of a company without changing the business. We\u2019s and paper know each other intimately.\n\nElla, at noon, pipetted what the panes had kept and found herself in love with new kinds of noise. She made pictures of sound and taped them to a cabinet the way people tape children\u2019s art to refrigerators when children have not drawn in that house. She wrote in a notebook the phrases that will be silly to anyone else: air remembers a path, the room protests being treated as a trumpet, the electricity is embarrassed at what it said in the hallway. She printed graphs and invented, because she had to, a way to say to a person in a robe that what they were looking at was proof and not a romance. Proof can be a romance if you don\u2019t teach it how to be shy.\n\nQuinn went to his foster dog and took the plant and chose for himself a corner that could be mistaken for fort. The dog, who had learned reportable tolerance of children in exchange for turkey, put her chin on his knee and accepted instruction in the ritual of no. He practiced saying no at a pace that would not spook her. He practiced saying okay to water the plant. He practiced putting the snowflake beside his drawing without being embarrassed to love something he had made. He practiced telling a woman with a rug that he would probably leave and that this was part of the arrangement, and she told him she had baked too many cookies and he was going to have to help. He took the cookie and performed disapproval to hide his gratitude, and she performed obliviousness to hide her heart. Both of them improved.\n\nThe clean-hands man sat in a room with a chair that had tried to forgive a hundred men and failed thirty times. The lawyer he deserved and the lawyer he got argued in neighboring hallways and produced the same conclusion. He could talk himself into legend or he could talk himself into prison. He had been talking himself into legend for months without achieving the stability legend requires, and he did what men do: he said an old sentence a new way. He said that he wanted to help, and Mendez said that she would accept help in the way one accepts a bottle of perfume from someone who buys apology as retail therapy. He said he had suppliers who thought they were in the cold business and on even-numbered days he worried that they were in the body business and he was offended by them for choosing poorly. She said to write the names in a way that would hurt his hand, and he did, because pain has a way of conferring authority he craved. He avoided the pronoun for the seam and for the boy. He slouched into myth for a minute and sat up because the chair groaned. He said, again to river his mouth, that he had built a listening machine because he wanted to turn no into a touchable object. He didn't say that he wanted to own a thing that had been denied him once and had continued to deny him forever. He didn't say, but thought, two women had said no to him, one at a desk and one in a church, and he had discovered that men are taught to build architectures when their arms cannot hold.\n\nAt the hospital, the volunteers delivered pamphlets and apology as a combo meal. Dev positioned at the foot of Clare\u2019s bed the way someone positions a bench in a park, with an eye to both view and conversation. He told her things about her body that she had already guessed and that he needed to have said aloud in the presence of other beliefs. He did not ask for an inventory of the room she had been left in, because he had learned from the kind of medicine he practices that when an organ fails in a certain way the most dangerous thing you can do is make it talk. Later, when the machines had calmed down and the light had decided it had other appointments, he told her that Lena\u2019s plants had done the thing where they look like they want you to notice and then pretend they don\u2019t, and he told her that the deli had added tomato without charging her which meant the owner was practicing a superstition on their behalf. She closed her eyes, as if to properly count that as luck, then opened them and asked him to make a list for her in his hand. He did. He wrote one. Eat bread without holes. Two. Thank the nurse with the shoe charm. Three. Call Lena and let the phone be the floor instead of a door. Four. Tell O\u2019Brian that the ghost of a patient she once followed is not her fault. Five. Ask Dev to drink water. He laughed and she went to sleep like a person allowing an employee to take over for a shift.\n\nNight stood outside the glass, waiting to see if anybody would roll down the window. The current, which had been instructed by no gods but had learned to be kind by being everywhere at once, ran its hand along the rails that were ghosts now, along the wires which had learned to update themselves by rumor, along the pipes which keep the city\u2019s version of life cycling and also keep secrets the way sofas do. It found the empty storage unit and said a polite goodbye to the jars it had refused to imagine as eyes. It found the bait shop\u2019s dented blue and asked the truck a question about character. It found Ella at her desk with her hair denying gravity and told her that she would never get paid enough for the kind of truth she told and thanked her anyway. It found the judge rubbing his hand and gave him an ache he would describe later as weather when it was guilt admitting it was a muscle.\n\nWhen O\u2019Brian got home, the angel in the deli had traded its harp for a trumpet the way angels do when they rehearse their secular albums. She went upstairs slower than necessary because a stairwell can interpret urgency as an insult. She opened the freezer and took out the old card with the instruction that had failed its test and had continued to be true because she had allowed it not to be. She turned the card over and wrote in an ordinary hand a new instruction that was not a command so much as a reminder, and she folded it the way you fold a letter you hate because it tells the truth. She wrote say yes to being seen and put it back where it belonged, which was in the cold, where statements go to be tested, disfigured, and then proven or forgiven.\n\nShe took the snowflake down and turned it over and wrote NOW HERE in her own hand with a pen that was too proud for the job. She put it back up because art is sometimes a promise you make to strangers and keep. She set the disc on the sill and watched the evening\u2019s lights break themselves into something useful, and she took the sword into her lap and told it the story of the day. It purred because it had been taught to, but also because in its own way it believed in the current and the way it insists that rooms are rooms and not verdicts. She laughed once, because she had an agreement with herself to do that daily, and when the laugh ended it left behind in the room a quieter noise, the kind of silence she had learned to learn from.\n\nThe phone lit up by its own rules. A message from Mendez with a photograph attached, a still from a security camera. Half a hallway, a mop bucket indifferent to myth, a hand reaching into frame to tug the cord of a light, a note in the foreground taped badly to a door with the words if found call and a number that mattered. The caption on the text read the Annex is cooperating in the way things do when they don\u2019t want to be sued, and underneath that in an uncommon use of punctuation from a cop as a gift to a friend: we might not be too late for the other names. O\u2019Brian stared at the hand in the image and could not swear whether it belonged to the man with the clean hands or to the idea of a seam or to a woman who had been told the word we and had started to believe she could be it and, whether she could or couldn\u2019t, had moved a light in any case.\n\nShe lay back without taking off her boots because some rituals earn grandfathering and some misdemeanors taste like dessert. She closed her eyes and walked the hallway the pane had offered her, not because she liked it but because it had proven it could be navigated without needing to become a corridor. She saw the coat and the hem and Lena\u2019s laugh sitting like a saved downpayment in the cuff. She saw the boy holding the plant and teaching the leaves the rule about windows. She saw Dev pretending to be stern about water. She saw Mendez blow her nose as if it were her job and then rip up the paper because ritual has to get bored somewhere. She saw Clare sleep with her mouth turned slightly at the corner because laughter waits in bodies that have been disciplined by other people\u2019s plans.\n\nMorning would come stupidly as ever, with light that had not read any of the memos. It would bring another Annex with another name and another ledger written by a hand pretending not to tremble and another lawyer tired enough to be kind by accident. It would bring men who think they can inventory the negative and put it on a dolly and women who will write their own lists to trick their hearts into consenting to continue. It would bring the aquarium and the blue fish tempted to become an analogy and refusing. It would bring another fight with boredom, which is the gentlest of the gods and therefore the most insulted, and it would bring mercy disguised as coffee. It would bring, too, the same long hum and the refusal of the current to become private property. It would bring, if she kept her side of the bargain, the particular kind of ordinary you get to keep when you have stopped collecting what should never belong to you.",
