The gulls were the first to know the hour, hemming the harbor with their knives of sound before the light had fully ripened. Zehavit rolled his cruiser along the edge of Market Street and watched the tide withdraw like someone taking their hand back. Portsmouth had the sort of mornings that asked you to look, quiet, nothing showy. Brick and white trim. Laddered masts and coffee that could peel paint. He wore the star on his chest like a kind of punctuation, a pause and a promise, and it weighed only what he let it.

People called him Ze. His mother had named him Zehavit because she loved a language full of edges and roots, and because she never thought he would end up in coastal New Hampshire with a scanner for a lullaby. She had wanted him to be solid and ordinary and also shining; names can be that contradictory. In the quiet just after sunrise, he thought about the way her hands always smelled faintly of cumin and lemon zest, about how she never learned to forgive a winter wind.

Dispatch crackled with a house alarm out near Sagamore, false, the kind of false that used to raise his blood pressure and now barely stirred him. He turned the wheel, his fingers tensed in a way the rest of him refused to be. “Ten-four,” he said, and the words were just work, nothing like the words he would begin to collect later, carefully as shells.

He had a partner on the day shift some days, Finn Lavoie, who had the laugh of a dog with its head out the window. Finn was off today, taking his son to a hockey clinic, and the town narrowed down around Ze like it did when you take off your glasses and everything gets both bigger and softer.

There is no single morning you decide to change your life. It happens in steps, in stutters. In his case, he parked the cruiser in the lot behind City Hall, went down the alley that smelled of damp cardboard and frying oil, and let himself into the diner where Gus kept the coffee like a sacrament.

“Sheriff,” Gus said, always that, even though the county had a sheriff and Ze was the deputy who did more than his share while the title stayed one door removed. “You want your usual?”

“Sometimes I think I’m my usual,” Ze said, and then he nodded, because all jokes fell to hunger. He sat at the counter with the cracked chrome and watched Etta, the waitress with a tattoo of a wheeling swallow at the base of her neck, pour coffee with the desperate care of someone who refuses to spill.

A plate of cranberry toast arrived with too much butter, sliding a little like a ship on a swell, and two eggs he didn’t know he had the appetite for until he did. He ate with the carefulness of someone who used to eat too fast and got heartburn for his trouble. No one told him he’d keep getting better at being alone.

“You still taking that class?” Etta asked, leaning in. Etta knew everyone’s lives the way some people learned bird calls.

“Tonight,” Ze said. “American lit.” He was embarrassed saying it, the way he had been embarrassed when he registered online in a moment of insomnia, thirty-six years old and deciding that maybe it wasn’t enough to drive the same streets and pick up the same arguments. The truth was that he didn’t take up all that much room in his own life anymore. He wanted an excuse to open a book and talk about it with strangers who might become not quite strangers.

“You’ll be smarter than the rest of us by spring.” She winked. “Bring me some of that fancy poetry next time.”

“Prose,” he said, “probably prose.” It didn’t matter; she was right about the desire. He wanted to be stunned by language again, the way he was as a kid when he read by any light he could steal.

At noon he delivered serve papers to a carpenter with shoulders like a pier piling, invisible muscles that only revealed themselves when he hefted a plank. The man took the envelope without looking at it, like he’d looked at too many of them already. Ze nodded and left, wishing there was something else he could offer, a kind of mercy that wasn’t in the job description.

By three the sky thickened and then let go, a drizzle that felt personal. He pulled over in an industrial park and listened to a voice on the radio talk about a stray husky near the high school. He found the dog nosing a candy wrapper, its eyes two different colors, and coaxed it into the back seat with half a granola bar. When it leapt up, it hit the cage with a metallic scrape, powerful but willing.

“You and me, huh?” Ze said. The dog gazed at him like he was a problem that could be solved by waiting.

He would later remember that dog, the way each problem in town felt like a small weight added to some old scale inside of him. The weights gathered. They always do. For now he drove the husky to the shelter and stood under the awning with the coordinator, a woman named Sandi who wore her hair in a braid that declared no nonsense. He watched rain thread itself, silver, thin. His shoulder hurt. He’d slept on it wrong or he’d slept on it right and the years had begun to tell him otherwise.

That night he sat in the third row of a small room with cinderblock walls painted an earnest white, the sort of college classroom that made you think of starting over and also of the smell of dry erase markers. The window faced a courtyard with a gingko that still had most of its leaves in stubborn coin-shapes. Students were raindrop-damp and chatty, and he sat up straight because the chair demanded it and because there are some rooms where slouching seems like an insult.

When she walked in, it was not the way they tell you to write it. It wasn’t slow motion or music that only a script can afford. It was a woman with a book under her arm and chalk dust already on her fingers, as if the white ghosts had been waiting for her. She dropped her bag on the desk and smiled without checking to see who caught it first. He felt the word teacher in his mouth as if it were something to chew.

“Hi,” she said. “I’m Nora Bell, and if you signed up for American Literature From the Civil War to The Now, congratulations. If you signed up for Art History, I’m still Nora Bell, and the Art History class is down the hall.”

They laughed. He laughed because everyone else did first and then because he wanted to. She had a way of standing like someone who owned her body gently. Her hair was that brown that catches reddish when she moved. She wore a sweater that looked like it had a history, with a soft hole at one cuff that made his chest hurt for reasons he did not intend to discover yet.

Some people love the sea because it doesn’t judge them. Some people love a voice for the same reason. Nora wrote on the board and talked about Whitman as if he were an uncle who came to dinner drunk and still got forgiven because he told the best stories. He watched her mouth shape the lines.

“We’re going to talk about largeness,” she said. “We’re going to talk about a country imagining itself into existence. There’s bravado and there’s harm, and there’s this crackling joy. And there’s—look—there’s this: I am large, I contain multitudes.”

He wrote the word multitudes in his notebook and underlined it before he could find a reason not to.

“What do you think he means?” she asked. At the back of the room there was a kid in a beanie with a ring in his lip who tilted his head like he was listening to an inside joke. There was a woman who knitted when she concentrated. There was a contractor with clay under his nails who rubbed his thumb against his forefinger, as if remembering grout. Ze did not plan to be first to speak. He felt entirely too visible, his sheriff’s jacket folded over the back of the chair, the star inside like a secret.

“It means you don’t have to choose,” said the knitter, not looking up. “It means you get to be messy and contradictory and it’s all part of you.”

“Good,” Nora said, and wrote messy, contradictory on the board. When the chalk squeaked, all of them winced in the same rhythm. It felt like a kind of prayer. “What else?”

The beanie kid said, “He’s bragging.”

“Sure. He’s also inviting,” she said. “He’s saying come here, let’s try a thing. Let’s be many. Let’s make room for it.”

Ze’s mouth opened and, to his surprise, words arrived. “It’s like a policeman,” he said. “You’re supposed to stand for something, but you’re not just that thing. You go home and you cook eggs and you call your sister and you get the oil changed and you cry sometimes in your car for no good reason. But you still wear the badge the next day.”

It felt like walking out on a lake and believing in ice without tapping it first. The room turned to look. Or maybe only he felt them turn. Nora’s eyes found him, clear, blue-gray as a storm that doesn’t happen yet.

“What’s your name?” she asked in a voice that made the question an invitation instead of a demand.

“Zehavit,” he said. “Ze.”

“Can I call you Ze?”

“Yes.” He felt fourteen and like someone had just asked if they could borrow a pencil.

“I like that,” she said, looking briefly at his jacket and then away from it, the way you look at a wedding ring. “I like the idea that the job and the man aren’t the same thing, that the public and the private are both true.”

Later, he would think about how careful she was with students’ names, about how she remembered that Emma preferred Em and that the contractor was Mike, not Michael. He would remember the story she told about the first time she read Dickinson and was frightened by how the words changed shape when you looked long enough. He would think about the way her left hand touched her necklace when she was thinking.

After class he waited longer than he needed to, but not so long as to be obvious, at least not to himself. He walked up and held his notebook close, as if in case someone needed to confiscate it.

“Deputy,” she said softly, then shook her head. “I’m sorry. Ze. I’m learning.”

“The first one was fine,” he said. “Both are true.”

“Well,” she said, “that puts us right at the theme for the semester. Can I ask—is there anything particular you want from this class? I ask because people who work in the world and then come here at night…I want to make sure it’s worth it.”

He thought of a thousand answers. He left them in his chest. “I want to read something that lifts the roof off a room,” he said, surprising himself again. “I want to talk about why a sentence makes that sound in your head.”

Her smile was like the space under a porch where a cat hides. “Me too,” she said. “We’ll do our best.”

“You don’t have to go easy on me,” he said. “I can take it.”

“You look like you can take a lot.” The words were out before she edited them, and he watched a flicker of something that might have been embarrassment or just the natural life of a joke. “I mean,” she added, “you can take the reading load.”

“I know what you meant,” he said. He liked him better in her presence, a version of himself that chose kindness even with himself as the recipient. He walked out into the evening that smelled like wet stone and hung back to see which direction she went. She went toward the lot where faculty parked, keys already in hand like a prayer bead. He did not follow. There was an ethics to wanting. He did not know it fully, but he felt it.

He spoke to his sister on the phone on the drive home. Tamar lived in Boston and did not forgive winter either. She did not forgive their father, and this was the quieter heartbreak of his life. They talked about nothing, then about something.

“You took a class,” she said, delighted as if he had finally looked up and joined the rest of the world. “Send me what you write.”

“Maybe,” he said. “If it doesn’t embarrass me.”

“Everything embarrasses you,” she said. “That’s not a standard.”

“It is for me.”

She made a sound that meant she loved him and then told him about a man she’d met who was so earnest it made his teeth look big. He laughed, the kind of laugh that opens the chest. When he hung up, the cruiser was very quiet. He listened to the air decide not to be. Back at his apartment, he ate a leftover chicken thigh cold, leaning over the sink because the sink was there and because sometimes it is a shelter, and then he sat at his table and wrote a page that began with the word multitudes and then dropped into a story from a call last spring about a woman who was sure her basement was full of bees. It was full of loneliness, which buzzed the same way in your ears.

He dreamed of chalk, of a little white thunder that did not threaten anything. In the morning, he made oatmeal and didn’t sweeten it because discipline is often about who you claim to be in the first ten minutes of the day. At roll call, Sheriff Harlan Keegan talked about a string of car break-ins down by Islington, about the recycling center issue that would not die, and about the select board meeting where everybody forgot they were neighbors. “Remember,” Harlan said, “we are the sober ones in a room full of people who aren’t always drunk on liquor.”

Finn was back and made a face at Ze that said yes and also no. “You’re glowing,” Finn said afterward, elbowing him. “What did you do?”

“Read a poem,” Ze said, and Finn snorted like he had stepped on a cat toy.

Faces. That’s the thing about working in a small city. The same faces show up. The old fisherman who claimed all coffee should be coffee and not pastry with morning attached. The high school girl who broke her mother’s window and then cried so hard Ze had to talk her into breathing like he coaxed drunks off a curb. Old Mrs. Knudsen, who called every Tuesday to report an unfamiliar vehicle on her street, even if it was the oil company truck. They were all his. He took them home mentally, a bag of groceries you can’t quite put down.

Nora’s next class smelled like wool and shampoo. He wore a different jacket, civilian, and felt like a different person, civilian. She handed back the first short writing exercise, and on his she had written at the top: You have an ear. Let it lead. Then in the margin, next to a sentence about the lot behind the pawn shop, she’d written: That image turns. More of that.

He stared at her handwriting longer than was necessary and then folded the paper like a secret note. Across the room, the beanie kid—whose name, it turned out, was Joey—was asking about why everybody thought Hemingway was some kind of god when his women were flat as paper dolls. Nora sat on the desk, legs crossed, and said, “We are allowed to love and be critical. It’s like loving a town that floods in spring. You own boots and you go on.”

He watched her mouth. He started making lists of words she loved. He noticed she said hinge and lattice and lilt the way some people say brother. She ran her fingers backward through her hair when she wasn’t sure about her own argument. She had a small scar on the inside of her left wrist, just above the watchband, a pale crescent like a bit of moon that refused to belong to any sky.

He wrote at night. He wrote about being a man who had half-built a life and was finally noticing the wind moving through it. He wrote about calls that ended with him in a doorway, both holy and ridiculous, saying something like, Hey there, we got a report, and realizing he wasn’t actually the answer but sometimes he could be the beginning of a better question.

Sometimes he forgot to eat dinner, and sometimes he remembered too well. He stood in the kitchen with a bag of potato chips and stopped before he reached in a second handful because he had spent years learning that he could say enough. There was not yet any hint of the later hunger, the kind that arrives like weather. For now, he was deliberate, and even his indulgences were planned like small holidays.

At the coffee shop on Saturday, he saw Nora with a stack of papers and an expression that said she was someplace else and also exactly here. He stood in line and calculated the odds. He told himself not to interrupt. He did not interrupt, but she looked up at the exact moment he turned and their eyes recognized each other. It felt like bumping into a friend in a city where you don’t know anyone.

“Ze!” she said, standing as if the additional verticality would make the moment fairer, more formal. “Are you grading too?”

He held up his notebook. “Writing,” he said.

“Can I read?” she said, and then laughed. “I’m kidding. I wouldn’t ask a student to let me invade his drafts on his day off.”

“Yes,” he said, and handed it to her before he could tell himself all the reasons not to. He watched her eyes move. His heart beat in that dumb rabbit way, urgent and not at all helpful.

“This,” she said at last, tapping a paragraph about the husky in the rain, “this is why people go to church. To be reminded there are animals asking to be let in and it’s our job to open the door.”

“I’m not a church person,” he said.

“I’m not a church person either,” she said, “but I go to the ocean and we both know that’s the same thing.”

They sat and talked for an hour at a table that had once been a door, with the old doorknob still embedded in its side like a relic. He saw the shape of her life in the things she didn’t say. She wore no ring. She mentioned a sister once, a town two hours inland where she grew up, a father who liked the Red Sox no matter who was on the roster, a mother who collected buttons and comforted herself with organizing them by color. She did not talk about anyone she might be going home to. He felt hope the way you feel a train before you hear it.

“I don’t date students,” she said, as if it were a natural thing to say to someone who had not asked. She said it lightly but with the weight of a rule she actually held close. “I just say that out loud because there’s always somebody who thinks the rule is secret.”

He nodded and tried to make his face a way of agreeing without wanting. “Understood,” he said, because he did. He also did not.

“Also,” she said, and looked past him, out the window to where gulls fought the wind over the river, “I think places like this require us to be neighborly beyond the classroom. So if I’m ever in trouble with some stupid appliance, I’m calling you.”

“I am very good with dishwashers,” he said. “I am terrible with toasters. I don’t explain it. I just live with the contradictions.”

“Whitman would approve,” she said.

They put their coats on at the same time, and he saw the way she pulled the sleeve down over her wrist scar and then as if remembering, stopped covering it. He wanted to ask, and did not. He wanted to touch without touching. He wanted a hundred small politenesses and heard himself becoming old-fashioned in his own head.

Back at the station on Monday, there was a case with two teenagers who’d been caught shoplifting cosmetics from a pharmacy. Ze sat in a back room and watched one of them shake like a phone on vibrate. He thought of all the ways a day could go wrong. He called the girl’s mother himself and waited while the woman hustled in, angry and relieved, her eyes two live wires. Ze was kind to all of them without being good. Afterward he ate a sandwich from the machine, its lettuce limp as a mood, and thought about how the world makes us choose between mercy and not getting sued.

Nora started assigning longer work. Ze wrote an essay about light, about his mother’s kitchen in August and the blue-gray magnificence of winter afternoons when the sky was the color of an old bruise and still he felt some warming. She marked it with praise and asked in the margin if he would read aloud in class. He did, closing his eyes on certain sentences, like he was driving through a snow squall and trying not to panic.

He took to walking past the campus even on nights he didn’t have class, finding excuses to turn the wheel and glide down that street where students moved in clumps, where the lights made him ache with meaning he hadn’t earned. He began to be a little ridiculous, which is to say human, which is to say perhaps finally. He would admit it. He could hold humiliation and still show up the next day. This was progress no brochure would ever print.

At home, he cooked pasta with garlic and an ungenerous amount of cheese and ate half and put the other half in the fridge because he planned to be better the next day. He bought a new belt. Not because he needed it. Because he needed something new. He read before bed and tried not to wonder if the word beloved can exist without the beloved.

In the third week, a guest sat in on Nora’s class. She was older, older the way some women are, with cheekbones that had not given up and a scarf that had opinions. She introduced herself as Dr. Helen Myles and said she was the department chair and liked to visit rooms where the students’ faces looked actively alive. She did not look at Ze any longer than she looked at anyone else. He watched Nora become a little more formal and then relax again in increments. He watched the way they smiled at each other as people who respect each other do, the smile of colleagues, the small and bright language of work-love.

“Read me the line that hurts you,” Nora asked the room. Ze watched the class pass a copy of Baldwin’s essay around like it was warming their hands. When it came to him, he ran his finger under a sentence and felt it like a bruise you press to confirm it’s not just a memory of impact. He read aloud. His voice was bigger in that room than it was anywhere else on purpose.

After, he walked to the parking lot and caught sight of a man leaning against a car that cost more than the sum total of most of the vehicles in the lot. The man wore a coat that said I am sure about my own temperature. He had the sort of hands that have never met grout. Ze noticed two things: the way Nora’s face changed when she saw him, flicker then corrected, and the way the man held her in a hug that was polite enough for anyone watching. It was not familiarity that spoke; it was the idea of it. He thought, a friend, a brother, a life outside of this room. He told himself stories and chose the kindest one.

Days thickened. The air narrowed; March, that liar, began to deliver its two-faced weather. The city plows loitered like teenagers in a parking lot, half a threat and half just bored. Ze kept his head down and did his rounds. He ate chili with Finn at a place with tinsel still stapled to the ceiling from a holiday they didn’t specify. He said yes to shifts he didn’t need to say yes to. He said yes to lunch with his neighbor Mrs. Alvarez, who made beans and rice that tasted like a memory you didn’t know was yours.

He wrote and brought what he wrote and then took home what Nora wrote on what he wrote. He slept and then he did it again, and somewhere in that repetition he found a rhythm that did not resent itself. He bought dark chocolate and broke off squares and let them sit on his tongue before biting, a discipline and a treat. He avoided the bakery on Maple the way you avoid an ex; he walked another block and felt virtuous in a way that made him irritating to himself, but he didn’t stop feeling it.

On an evening that was more spring than winter, he pulled up to the curb outside the humanities building and watched a tow truck take a car away. The gulls approved or disapproved, who could tell. He sat and put his forehead against the steering wheel for five seconds, the way his therapist had taught him when he still went to her. The therapist had told him to count. The therapist had told him to replace the phrase I am tired of myself with I would like to be kinder than I have been. He said the words now, quietly, into the dark. He believed them only a little. You could build from that.

Nora had assigned them to bring in a two-page scene that included something both broken and blooming. He wrote about his father’s suitcase, patched with duct tape, the handle broken, the way he kept taking it out and putting it on the bed in his hospital room as if he could leave anytime. He wrote about a sapling rooting in the unlikeliest slice of dirt next to the parking garage. He brought it to class and watched as she read it, there at the desk, in the minute before things began, her mouth barely moving and then still. She said, “Will you read?” and he did, and when he looked up she smiled in a way that was pride and also something else he would not dare to name.

“Have I told you about the reading series?” she asked him afterward, handing him a flier that had been xeroxed one time too many. “Locals come, students read if they want, people clap and then eat cookies. It’s basically church.”

“I keep showing up to church,” he said.

“That sounds like you know something,” she said.

He went to the reading. He did not read. He stood at the back and watched the young ones perform being shy and then perform the opposite. Nora stood with Helen and the man in the expensive coat, and when Ze was brave enough to hover near, Nora introduced them. “Ze,” she said, “this is Julian. He runs the gallery on Bridge Street. He’s an infuriating reader of fiction.” Her tease hit as fond. Julian shook Ze’s hand with a grip that was firm enough to disclaim softness and smiled a smile that knew how to be seen. His teeth looked expensive but kept their opinions to themselves.

“I love a good sheriff,” Julian said. “I break no laws, I promise, except the aesthetic ones.”

“Those are the only ones I enforce with any pleasure,” Ze said. It surprised him that he could be funny around a man like that. It surprised him that he liked him, a little. He could see why someone might like him a lot.

When he left, the street was cindered with leftover salt, the kind that crunches and reminds you we live by negotiation with ice. He watched the river take back the bridge lights and stood there long enough that a woman out walking her dog nodded and then the second time, after another block, nodded again, as if the second acknowledgment made the first one official.

He thought about writing to Nora. He thought about a sentence that begins with I know the rules. He wrote it in his head and then put it away like you put a knife back in the drawer instead of the dishwasher. He went home and ate a bowl of cereal that had opinions about sweetness and fell asleep on the couch with the television asking him if he was still there.

There were calls that did not go well. There was a man who refused to come out and then came out yelling and then sat down and wept and by the time Ze left, nothing in his uniform felt like his. There was a parking dispute that ended with Finn getting shoved and then apologizing and then getting mad about his own apology. There was a mailbox that someone exploded with what may have been fireworks and what may have been boredom wearing a mask. He delivered bad news in doorways and good news nowhere because nobody ever wants to receive it formally. He drove. He slept. He came into the classroom and took his place.

Nora brought in photographs to go with the reading one night—Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange—and they talked about the face as a version of a page. He watched her hold the image of a woman whose children were turned away from the camera and listened to her say the sentence: We must be responsible for the eyes we use. She put the photos away like someone closing a window.

“Coffee?” she asked him after class, the word so simple he almost tripped over it. “In the building. Not like…not a thing. Just, you know.”

“Yeah,” he said. “I know.” He followed her to a little faculty kitchen with a machine that sighed as if exasperated by its own function. She found two clean mugs. They had chipped rims, old ceramic that had stopped hoping to be anything else.

“How’s the work?” she said, stirring powdered creamer as if this were not a betrayal.

“Clean,” he said. “Most of the time it’s clean. We keep it that way.”

“And yours?” she said. “The grading. The having to be the one with the chalk.”

“Grading is sometimes like seeing your face under a light you wouldn’t have chosen,” she said. “The chalk I love. The students I love. The bureaucracy…” She made a face. “I know there are people who derive actual pleasure from forms. I do not know any of them personally.”

“You’re good at it,” he said. “The room. You’re good in the room.”

“Some days,” she said, and her humility was not performative. “Some days I am better.”

Julian texted her while they stood there, the phone lighting up like a small fish in a dark pool. He saw her glance at it and then put it face down. He saw what he saw and then he asked for mercy from his own mind, which already wanted to write a story with a beginning, a middle, and a yes.

“I should go,” he said, and she said, “Me too,” and then they did not go for a minute, as if the stillness between them were doing a job, as if it needed to finish.

The next week, he read in the series. He felt his hands shake. He didn’t try to stop them. He read about light and the backpack with duct tape and he made a joke at the end that landed, to his absurd relief. Nora’s clap was specific; it was like a lighthouse, directional. Julian clapped too, and later clapped him on the back as if the two claps were adjacent. “You’ve got something,” Julian said, and Ze thought, He says that to everyone, but he also thought, I will take it.

He told Tamar about it on the phone. She howled. “You? On a stage?”

“Don’t say stage,” he said. “It was a carpeted platform.”

“That’s worse,” she said, and he laughed until he had to take the phone away from his mouth and just feel the laugh in his throat like heat.

Spring came and then went away for a minute and then came again, the way it does here, nervous. The city began to smell a little like mud. People rolled their sleeves up too soon. Ze took the jacket off his dinner chair and hung it in the closet and felt triumph over nothing, which is the best kind.

He did not know the shape the summer would take, not yet. He did not know about the heat that would press him into different decisions, an enormity that would become its own country. For now, he was a man who could hold two ideas at once. He could drive across town to answer a call and then sit in a room where someone said, Tell me why that sentence made you feel like your grandmother hugged you. His hunger was a small sound then, the kind you hear only when you turn the radio off. He kept the dial down and listened for something else—the scratch of a pencil, the soft-caught breath when a question landed, the word multitudes with new vowels each week.

On a day that looked like a clean plate, he found himself in Gus’s again, the morning spread before him like somebody’s reasonable plan. Etta slid him a blueberry muffin that had no business being so tender. “On the house,” she said. “You performed. The town owes you.”

“The town owes me,” he said, deadpan, “because I saved Julian’s aesthetic crimes from the proper authorities.”

“You like that man?” Etta asked, half teasing.

“I don’t know him,” Ze said. He found that he meant it. It was not a loop yet, that thought, it was just a line.

“You ever gonna ask out the teacher?” she said, softening when she saw him stiffen. “Listen. It’s the ways of the world. People who explain things well are worth loving.”

“I like the ethics,” he said. “She keeps them in a drawer and takes them out and polishes them in front of me.”

“And that makes you want to kiss her even more,” Etta said, because she did not respect the line he had drawn around speaking it.

He laughed and broke the muffin in half. Buttered one side. Ate the other plain. “I don’t know. Maybe I just want to be near the thing that makes sense.”

Etta nodded. “We run out of clean sense by April,” she said. “I say stock up.”

He went to class with crumbs on his sleeve and Nora had chalk on her palm, and in that small economy, they traded. He wrote something that made Helen say, later, “If you ever want to apply to the MFA, I can write a letter.” He said, “I have a job,” and she said, “It’s a part-time program,” and for the first time he allowed the sentence a future tense. He went home and stood in front of the bathroom mirror and tried to see the man in a workshop, the man with a lanyard, the man who knows adjectives without apology.

On the last night of this first part of the story, he sat in his car outside the gallery on Bridge where Julian had an opening and watched people be beautiful at art. He watched Nora inside, her laugh small and particular, her hand on her own arm, not on anyone else’s. He could see his reflection in the glass and he could see through it, both. He thought of multitudes and of a bruise the sky learns to make when it wants to tell you rain is coming. He rested his head back against the seat and let his eyes close. He told himself a simple truth. He said it in the voice he saved for dogs and for children and for drunks and for his own heart when it knocked too loudly. Wait. Just wait. You’re allowed to want and you’re allowed to wait. The wanting does not kill you. The waiting is its own kind of food. He did not yet know what he would do when hunger taught him other names. For now, he could name this. For now, it was enough to sit in the car and breathe. The night did not argue. The ocean held the town in its under-voice. He went home before the lights went out. He slept like a man who had done what he could.The heat took the town by the collar and did not shake so much as insist. It arrived in a way that made window screens suddenly more than decoration and made ceilings sound their faint electric whine as fans turned and turned like patient thumbs rubbing a worry stone. The river’s skin grew a sheen, a confidence that sent shimmer up under the bridges, and people walked slower because you have to respect a temperature that makes itself king. Ze traded the starched winter undershirts for cotton that did not pretend it was equal to the day, and he learned which seats in the cruiser turned hot first and which trees threw the kind of shade that mattered. Mornings still had their thin quiet, the gulls like white punctuation over the boats, but by noon everything felt like somebody had left the oven door open and the recipe was the town itself.

Everyone got a little extra particular, the way heat makes us weird. Mrs. Knudsen called to report her neighbor’s hydrangeas had “lost all sense of propriety,” which turned out to mean the blue had deepened into drama in a way that made her uncomfortable. Teenagers moved in shoals toward the water, shoelaces untied, laughter a decoy for the old grief that summer always carries, the grief of briefness. Finn, in shorts that made his legs look like they were still deciding about commitment, put a cooler in the back of his car and told Ze he was in love with ice again, as if it were a person he had left and then forgiven. Ze kept a hand towel draped over the seat next to him and drank water until it felt like a job. He was a good citizen of the weather and still the heat made his patience a thinner thread.

On a Saturday that smelled like sunscreen and old brass, Market Street went glittery with a festival that promised crafts and delivered, as festivals do, exactly what you expect. There were jars of jam with ambitious labels, ceramics that looked like clouds had been kiln-fired, paintings of boats so sincere Ze wanted to salute them. He nodded to the firefighter who always won the pie-eating contest and to the city councilor who had a handshake like he was holding a small bird, and he was decent with traffic cones because there are ways to be important that involve fluorescent hats. Across the way he saw Julian in linen that deserved a climate-controlled room and next to him Nora in a sundress that had learned a good lesson about pattern and restraint. Her hair was braided back, and when she laughed at something Julian said, she tipped her head in a way that made the light glad to have been invited. Ze looked exactly as long as was neighborly and then looked away because that is a kind of love too.

Just when he thought the day would be content to gleam and sweat and go home, the call came in about a boy in the water near Prescott Park, and the town’s heart moved to stand in one place. Ze put the lights on because some sounds are useful lies and because people part for a color they’ve learned to fear and respect. When he reached the river, the crowd behaved like all crowds around a single point of fear, which is to say they were generous and terrible, making space and offering advice and letting their eyes do what eyes do when they cannot change the thing they see. Officers and volunteers cut the water with their arms as if they could muscle it into giving. A man with a boat pointed in every direction at once. A woman with a towel spoke to no one and everyone, her mouth open like the word no had been stuffed inside and could not be pulled out. Ze took his place at the edge and went in up to his chest because the boundary between his job and his body had not existed for a long time. The river was cold in a way that argued with the day, and it hit his ribs with an honesty he recognized.

After, there were compressions. After, there were sirens. After, there was the sound a mother makes that has no analog in the natural world and yet is the most natural thing, the sound of something torn and still attached. Ze pressed his palms to the deck of the dock where water had made the wood silver and thought of nothing, then thought of all the stupid, beautiful days he had been allowed to have. He let the medic take his elbow and lead him away because he was not the person who could say anything that mattered in that moment. He watched a gull wheel and then sit back down on the pilaster as if deciding not to leave was the braver act. The crowd peeled apart like tape, sticky and loud. People went home to make pasta and look at their children with suspicion and renewed awe. He stood and let the sun burn a line along his forearms and accepted that some afternoons do not fit into any pocket of sense.

He did paperwork with the kind of determination that makes handwriting mean more than it does and then he went back to his apartment and put his head against the refrigerator door like it could tell him a joke. He called Tamar and did not let her be useful at first because he did not have the sentence that would fit inside a conversation. She said his name into the receiver the way their mother used to call them to dinner, and it undid something that needed undoing. He told her enough, not more than that, and she made the small animal noises people make when they want to pull your pain into their chest and learn it by heart. “You go to the ocean,” she said, not as a command but as a remembering of an old instruction. “You go let the big water tell you your body is the right size.” He said okay, and then he sat in his kitchen for a while, the air standing there like a person he didn’t mind.

He wrote that night with the lights off and the fan on, the page a place he could put his eyes when the room was done hosting his grief. He wrote the river as a person whose moods were real and not to be argued with, he wrote the way a crowd forms and then unforms, he wrote the part where his palms felt like they would glow because they had held the idea of a heart not as metaphor. He did not write the mother’s sound, because some things remain in the throat as they should. When he brought that piece to Nora, she did not mark it with her usual choir of arrows; she wrote three sentences, each one with more care than if she had written a book. She wrote that the page had its own weather and that she felt the current, and she wrote, We tell what we can and we leave what is not ours. After class she touched his sleeve near the seam as if checking for rip, and he told her that he had swallowed some of the river because it had nowhere else to go. She said, “You did the thing you could,” and then, because she is who she is, she said, “and where did that leave you?” He said it left him leaning against the fridge and it left him at his table and it left him here, and he watched her think and then let the thought go because it wasn’t needed for the moment.

The heat did not relent; it took the news as permission. There were more calls that became tests of what the body can tolerate and what the mind is allowed to name afterward. Ze used the Narcan twice in one week and, both times, the world came back into someone with a violence that made him think of thunderheads. After the second, the man who blinked awake said, “You’re an angel, man,” and Ze wanted to say he was not, that he was a man with a kit and a willingness to kneel on hot asphalt, but he did not teach in those moments, he just stood up and wiped his hands and let the gratitude land somewhere it could be used later. Finn bought popsicles at the gas station and looked like a person thinking of a different career for ten minutes and then remembering he liked being exactly where he was. They stood under a streetlight that hummed with its own private bees and ate cherry ice that painted their tongues, and Finn said, “Sky looks like an armpit,” and Ze laughed with a relief that felt like he had reached the surface.

Nora asked him if he could carry boxes into her office because the summer had encouraged a migration of books, and her wrists had developed opinions about weight. The humanities building smelled less like chalk in summer and more like cardboard warming slowly, and in the stairwell the air moved only because they did. She handed him boxes that said Norton and BOMB and Michigan in black marker and said she had read somewhere that moving books counts as exercise for the soul. He said his soul was sweaty. In the small room that held her off-balance desk and a chair that would be polite to no one, he set down a box labeled -ING Words and looked at the scar on her wrist and did not pretend he had not seen it. She saw him see it and turned her hand over, also not pretending. She told him about a teenage summer and a house with windows that stuck and a stubborn girl who thought she could make the world move if she pulled hard enough. The glass gave and took at the same time. She told it as if she had only just forgiven the physics. He set the box down on the floor with more care than he had planned and sat on the edge of her desk because otherwise the intimacy would have been too much standing up. She asked if he would take another class in the fall, and he said he wanted to but he also wanted to see if he could write without a room to turn the key in. “There are other rooms,” she said, and smiled like she had put one in her pocket for him and would not give it to him until he asked with the right words.

When the gallery’s alarm went off after midnight, the sound in the alley was spare and efficient, and the gulls, dignified by dark, declined to weigh in. Ze had driven that block enough times to know the way the streetlight skipped half the bricks and how the shadows from the iron balconies looked like a lace someone might have stolen from the nineteenth century and pinned to a building with good hips. The door had been forced open in a way that was tidy rather than brutal, and inside the air had the self-satisfied dust of rooms where things are looked at more than touched. What had been done was exactly what some people who hate would do: nothing was taken and everything hurt. Two canvases were slashed with a care that made the cuts look like monsters pretending to be rivers, and one sculpture had been lifted and then put down hard enough to crack and yet not shatter, the way a person can be hurt and still stand. Julian was there with his hair done by desperation and a composure that was part self and part performance. He met Ze’s eye and said, “This is what happens when you bring any kind of beauty into a town that believes in its own reflection,” and then he said, “I’m sorry, that was unkind,” and then he said, “I’m furious,” because sometimes the honesty arrives third.

Ze did his work with his notebook like it was a net for flies and did not mistake his liking for the man as a reason to trust his memory over someone else’s. The back door was clean of prints in a way fingerprints often announce themselves, and the broken-in felt deliberate, not rushed. On the ground near the sculpture, an earring gleamed like an accident, and when he put it in a bag it looked like a beetle that had forgotten its art. He asked Julian for a list of anyone who would be irritated with him enough to send a message dressed as critique, and Julian obliged with names and with a shrug that had method acting in it but also the gravity of a person whose livelihood had just been insulted. “Artists break their own hearts,” Julian said, “but they don’t break each other’s, not like this,” and Ze nodded because to argue would have been cruel. Off to one side of the open floor, there was a clipboard with a sign-in sheet from the last opening, loops of ink that meant almost nothing and everything.

The next morning Nora stood on the sidewalk with coffee that had abandoned ambition and asked if he had been the one to respond, and when he said yes she tilted her head in that way that made what she was about to say feel like a gift. She said she hated that the town would now talk of this for two weeks as if it were the most interesting story, and then some other loud thing would replace it. She said art gets vandalized all the time and it almost never has to do with art. She said the word petty without contempt, which he admired. He told her about the earring and the angle of the cuts and how care looks different when it hurts something, and she closed her eyes and said that human beings are so strange. Her mouth made a shape like she might ask him about Julian, and then her mouth decided not to. The boundaries were a thing they cared for together like a houseplant neither of them wanted to kill.

Harlan called him into the office and talked about eyes and about how a town needs its gossip the way a tired person needs a nap they won’t take. “You keep clean lines,” Harlan said, not unkind and not unaware. “You like a teacher and the teacher knows a gallery man and the gallery man has a problem and you have a job, and all those things can be true and also we can be very careful with the knitting of it.” Ze felt a flare of mortification not because he had done anything but because someone else had named what he had named. He nodded and said he would be careful, and he was, and he knew, as with the river, that carefulness sometimes does and sometimes does not change the ending.

He started an application he did not tell anyone about, a thing with questions that wanted him to explain why he would sit in rooms and call it school when he had a badge and a life with a shift calendar. He wrote about his mother’s kitchen and his father’s suitcase and the river and Mrs. Alvarez’s beans that tasted like somebody had written a recipe on your arm and then washed it off and it still worked. He wrote about wanting to be a person who made more good nouns and sent less bad air into the world. He sent Helen a note that began with “you said” and ended with “if it’s all right with you,” and she wrote back with delight and a schedule and two exclamation points that would have embarrassed him from anyone else and that from her felt like a wind at his back. He bought better paper, which is to say he treated himself like someone who could be taken seriously, and the receipt sat in his wallet like a ticket.

At night, when the heat hung around like a roommate who had paid half the rent and therefore could not be thrown out, he drove down to the point and took off his boots and put his feet in the water in a way that satisfied both the child he had been and the man he was letting himself be more often. Lights from Kittery made the river think glitter was a kind of argument, and he let the small bites of cold climb his ankles and make a case for attention. A couple on a bench negotiated about the word forever in low voices that knew they were too young to make it mean what it wanted to mean. Somewhere a radio tried for jazz and landed on the idea of it, and that was almost good enough. He thought about the husky with two eyes, each one their own country, and he remembered the way the dog had looked at him like he would wait for as long as Ze took to decide. Waiting felt less like a noble act and more like a food that sometimes nourishes and sometimes just fills time, but he took a bite and then another because he had promised himself he would see what this kind of patience could do to a man. He texted Nora one sentence about drinking water in the heat and she texted back a photograph of her empty glass with the lemon slice curving inside like a little boat, and he felt his body say yes to a form of being that did not yet have a finish.

The gallery thing grew stupid the way these things do. An online forum decided that vandalism was part of a larger moral failure somehow related to city bike lanes, and an op-ed used the word decadence, and Julian, to his credit, did not fan the particular flames with a statement that would satisfy the pitchfork-class. Ze found a local kid who had posted a video at two in the morning, a kid whose mother made him tea while Ze stood on the porch and asked questions with his eyebrows because the kid had already said, with his mouth, that he had not been anywhere near the gallery. The earring did not belong to anyone whose ear they could find. The slashes were made by something a little dull, a blade that needed sharpening, a fact that felt like information if you were a person who wanted to feel like you were moving forward. He wrote the words dull blade in his notes and drew a line next to them and then made the line longer to make himself feel like he had done something.

He and Finn did traffic at a night market where a woman sold soap in shapes that made Finn uncomfortable because he refused to wash with anything that looked like a baby pumpkin or a heart. They ate dumplings standing up and talked about Finn’s son’s shoulder and whether hockey had a grudge against ten-year-olds. Later, Ze drove past Nora’s building without intending to and saw her at her window with a book open and something in her other hand that might have been a spoon. The domesticity of it was a kind of art he had never been asked to applaud, and he did, privately. Julian’s car was not on the street, and then it was, and then Ze kept driving because the story you tell yourself about timing is useful but insufficient. He went home and read the page Helen had sent him about writing samples and tried not to count the times he had used the word light.

When a storm finally shouldered the heat aside, it did so with a discipline Ze admired. The rain came down like somebody had opened a serious door and decided to leave it open. The thunder texted the town ahead of time with a dry joke and then arrived with the right boots and got to work. He woke to the sound and smiled because there are noises the body recognizes as relief, things that say we are all little and also loved. He sat at his table and wrote about the storm speaking to the parched lawns in a language they remembered, and he made himself put the word mercy in a sentence without apology. He brought that to Nora and watched her read, and she did not laugh when he got grand; she pointed where the sentence could be more precise and asked if he knew the difference between rain and squall and shower, and he said he did not, and she said then that could be the work this week, naming what water does when it falls.

The call that pulled him out into the damp dark that same week was not dramatic in the way a drowning is dramatic but it became, in the way families do, an epic. A house on a side street had packed itself with argument until one of the walls flexed and it all spilled out into a night that was trying to be kind. He arrived for the end and stepped into a kitchen where there were three adults, two teenagers, and a floor with a history of spills, and he used his voice in the way you use a key you are not entirely sure opens the right door. He separated argument from the person wearing it, and it took longer than he wanted and less time than he feared. He wrote the names. He refilled the little paper cup next to the sink with tap water and watched a young man drink and not pretend he wasn’t shaking. When he went back to his cruiser, he sat with the engine off and let the rain pick at the roof and told himself he was learning how to let other people keep their dignity, and that this was maybe a kind of art too.

At the reading series, he brought a new piece and did not plan to stand up and then stood up anyway, because habit is a script but sometimes you improvise. He read about a paper cup next to a sink and about the way someone will look you in the eye when you get their name right, and he made the joke he did not mean to make and it worked again, and he thought perhaps humor is a liturgy he could join without betraying anything. When he sat down, Nora’s clap found him as always, and Helen’s smile warmed him with approval he had not thought he needed, and Julian leaned over at intermission and said he had found a way to hang the damaged paintings so that the slashes catch the light on purpose, and they agreed it was better than leaving them unseen. People ate cookies as if sugar were the kind of comfort that knows its job and doesn’t try to do more. Ze walked home slower than he had planned and put his hand on the brick of a building because sometimes you touch what has outlasted you to remind yourself of scale. He did not text anyone when he got in the door. He let the dark do the dark’s work and he lay down and he dreamed about a room with all the doors open and no one stealing a thing.

Late that month, on patrol near the shipyard when everything smells like a kind of iron you can taste, he saw the husky on a leash attached to a woman in a Red Sox cap, and the dog recognized him and did the forward lean that is respect without permission. The woman smiled and said the name they had given him was Atlas because he could carry a mood and not somersault under it. Ze scratched the ruff in a way that honored both the leash and the desire, and the dog closed his eyes with a trust that would have ruined a lesser man. The woman said they had found him through the shelter and sometimes he runs to the water and just stands there until someone says his name, and Ze said there are worse prayers, and the woman nodded like she had had a long talk with the same pastor.

He had told himself a lot of things about waiting and he repeated them not like an incantation but like a list on the fridge you don’t place under a magnet because you already know what’s on it. When the semester ended for real and there was no grade to give and no roster to mark, he did not knock on Nora’s door with flowers that would embarrass both of them. He wrote her a note that said he was grateful for rooms where language was a tool and a toy. She wrote back, folding her sentences like origami, saying she was grateful for men who arrive with their ears on. They agreed, without naming it, to meet for coffee near the end of the week. It was not a secret and it was not an announcement. It was the sort of thing two people do who have been careful and would continue to be. On the way there he got called to a fender bender that had the mood of a duel and he untangled it with the tired skill of a person who could have a second job as a therapist if he liked forms more. He texted that he’d be late and she texted that she was a person with a book and a window and patience, and he felt the hunger sit down at the table like a guest who had chosen to be polite. He was not ready to call it anything else. He was ready to pour it a glass of water and ask how its day had been.He was twelve minutes late to the coffee, twelve minutes that felt, strangely, like a small betrayal even though there had been a bumper-to-bumper ballet of tourists and a fender bender where two men had practiced the ancient art of being right. Nora was in the window with the book and the lemon wedge boat in her glass, and she looked up when the bell above the door clapped its small hands. The look she gave him was not the kind you give someone who has offended you; it was the kind you give someone you are glad to see even when they have made time rearrange itself. He said, “Sorry,” with his palms up, and she shook her head and put a slip of paper between pages as if the book needed tucking in.

“Did you use that voice?” she asked, stirring the thin ice with the straw in a way that made him think of the river darning itself.

“The one that says we have better things to do with our temper than feed it?” he said. “Yeah.”

“It works,” she said, and smiled like they were already past the part where apology was the subject and now they could talk about anything else that made a life.

They talked about nothing reckless at first, the way you test the surface of a lake with your toes. The coffee place was full of college kids who had not yet learned to be embarrassed by the way they occupy space, and a man at the far table kept rearranging his laptop like it was a chessboard and he could outplay it if he only moved it three inches to the left. She told him she had found a way to teach Dickinson that made three students swear under their breath and then come up after class to thank her, and he said he had figured out that if you point a traffic wand like a conductor’s baton, some people will actually follow it like they’re playing in an invisible orchestra. The lemon slice in her glass leaned and then righted itself; he had a ridiculous desire to keep it from capsizing, as if she needed him to manage the physics of citrus.

“Helen told me,” she said, not making a meal of it, “that you sent an application.”

He blinked and then tried on the smile he wore when someone caught him putting a dollar into a donation box. “I did,” he said. “I haven’t told anyone but my sister. And Finn, by accident, because I left the form open and he came in and read the phrase statement of purpose and said I should just write ‘I want.’”

“Finn is not wrong,” she said. “Purpose is hunger that knows its own first name.” She didn’t preen on Helen’s revelation; she just set it on the table with the napkins. “I’m glad,” she said, and the words had the soft certainty of someone offering a chair.

He could have asked about Julian, could have set the conversation on that track and watched it go where people like to make their own lives into a show called Clarity. He waited instead, not to make her do the work of honesty, but to give every sentence a chance to find its right body. She watched his hands and then let hers find the scar at her wrist and rest there like a friend. “Julian and I,” she said, and then took a breath that tamped down the drama the way you tamp down brown sugar, “we were a thing. We were a good thing for a while. We are not one now, and we are also not two people who look the other way when we see each other, because I don’t believe in pretending people vanish.”

“Two truths,” he said, a little dry, a little grateful. He found his eyes studying the shelf of syrups behind the counter—the lineup of vanilla and hazelnut, the way they promise more than they can deliver—and he decided the metaphor was too easy and let it go.

She told him a short story, not a novel, about last winter and the way loneliness knocks on the door of old loves first because it knows where the lock is. She said it without asking for his permission to have had a past, and he sat in it the way you might sit in a pew dedicated to somebody else’s ancestor. The room around them made room. When she finished, she put the lemon wedge back in the glass with care, as if she had resolved to stop worrying it, and he said only, “Thank you,” because there were no prizes for deduction today, and the tenderness in his voice made her look out the window and back in without pretending she had been distracted by anything except mercy.

They walked by the river when the coffee was gone because you do that here without planning it. The tide had opinions but it kept them to itself, rearranging the shore with secret hands. He told her about a call the week before where a woman had barricaded her garden with string and bells because she wanted to believe she could keep out the raccoons and also time, and how he had stood in the yard and listened to the argument between what we can do and what we cannot. She laughed and then didn’t, because the story was funny until it was not, and he realized again why he wanted to be careful with her; she was a person who could accompany herself from one emotion to another without apology.

They reached the spot where the stone steps go down into the water and stop at the line the river insists on, and she took one step and then a second, her sandals making a sound like a word she wasn’t going to say. He did not reach out, not because he was practicing some library-book idea of patience, but because she was steady and he knew better than to interrupt someone’s balance. “If you get in,” she said, “I’ll follow.”

“I have my boots,” he said. “We will save baptism for when the river isn’t looking.” It was a joke and it wasn’t, and she looked at him with a gleam that asked him to be a person who could bear a blessing when it arrived.

His radio did not care where they were when it barked. Harlan’s voice came through with that low, unhurried tone he uses when something is wrong and there is no use in making it wronger with speed. The gallery again, he said, and the word again did the work of thirty details. Ze closed his eyes for a second, which he had learned is different than rolling them, and then he touched Nora’s shoulder as if to tell a child breathes in her sleep—gently, an old agreement. “I have to,” he said, and she said, “Of course,” and he ran without making it look like he thought running would change the facts.

Inside, the hurt had been rewritten. Not the slashes this time, though one canvas had been revisited, its wounds widened with more confidence. The most obvious newness was a sentence on the wall in black marker, a sentence that looked like a person had written it in a hurry and then stepped back and wanted to stand by the words longer than he could afford. It said, “I am not your mirror,” and underneath, smaller, as if an afterthought left by a different hand, “We are paintings, not windows.” There was no Whitman here, no quotation marks, no credit to some poet who could take the blame. Julian stood with his hands in his hair, not because he believed the gesture would help, but because sometimes a body tells its own truth louder than your mouth can. “They’re writing,” he said to Ze with a grim laugh. “God help us. They’ve learned to narrate.”

Ze did what he does, the lists in a tidy, sturdy script that tamped down the room’s panic. He noted the angle of the marker strokes and the way the e’s stood open-mouthed, the earring from last time that did not, yet, have a sibling, the slight grit on the floor by the back door that could be brick dust from the alley or something else. He asked the questions you ask a man whose house has been invaded twice, and he did it in a way that made the man feel less like a house and more like a person in a chair. He asked about enemies and about old arguments and about interns with sticky fingers and about who had keys that were not keys, and Julian gave him names, most of which had never belonged to any real threat.

On the wall, the words looked as if they were watching him. He did not have a mystical bone in his body, but he did have a kind of respect for sentences that act like they can lift their heads and see you. He felt, absurdly, a blush at the notion the vandal might be talking to him as much as to the town. Later, when Nora asked him what had been written, he edited himself for the first time since he had met her. He told her the first sentence and let the second one sit a while longer in his pocket like a small theft he intended to return.

“A mirror is a terrible way to be,” Nora said when he gave her the one line, and he watched her try not to turn it into a seminar. “People think they want reflections. They want absolution.” She stopped herself, put a hand against a lamppost as if it were a metronome. “Sorry. I’m doing the thing.”

“You do the thing,” he said. “It’s why I showed up in the first place.”

They had not called it anything, the way they were showing up for each other, and it was a relief not to name it yet. Harlan did not write him up for the case, but he did say, “I want you to step to the left of it,” in a way that made his chest loosen and tighten the same moment. There was a detective from the state who liked to collect phrases and Ze had to stop himself from bristling when the man wrote down I am not your mirror with the satisfied care of someone who has discovered a fossil. They checked the cameras again and found only their own faces in reflection because the angles were still poor and the lights still angry with glare. Later, a kid from the pizza place two doors down said he had heard a squeak like a marker making its small song and also a laugh, quick and bright like a match. He described the laugh with a hand gesture that said it flicked and then was gone. Ze added laugh, match-flick to his notes and felt ridiculous and also useful.

He slept badly and then better, the storm’s leftover air licking the town into a calm that felt earned. On the next day off, he took Gus up on the omelet with spinach that looked like the idea of health more than the thing, and he read on his phone an email from the program that did not say yes and did not say no. It said, We would like to talk, in a tone that was more human than he had expected. Helen wrote within an hour as if she had been waiting in a chair with her sandals in her hand like a teenager at a sleepover, and she told him which professors would be on the call and which questions they liked to ask, and she told him to be exactly who he had been when he wrote about his mother’s light. He wanted to tell her he had written about the river too, but he knew better than to argue with someone who had chosen the best possible detail and held it up like a lantern.

He bought a shirt that felt like he was not lying. It was only a shirt, pale blue, nothing rhetorical or aspirational, but when he put it on he looked at himself and did not make fun of the man in the mirror. He told Tamar and she made a noise that was a cheer and a curse because their mother would have loved this and their mother was not here to love anything in person anymore. They let themselves be quiet with that and then, like good siblings, nudged their way back into the day with a shared joke about how Ze would handle being in a room full of people who knew what synecdoche meant and wielded it without fear. He said he would bring a bag of pliers and a willingness to remember anyone’s name, and she said that was a skill set most programs lacked.

Nora and he did not make plans like teenagers, frantic and constant. They found each other the way tide finds a certain rock. He helped her move a bookshelf from one part of the apartment to another and it took an hour because the thing refused to admit the geometry of doorways. “I thought everything was narrative and we just push,” she said, laughing, hair in her eyes, and he said sometimes you pivot and the villain becomes a less interesting character. In her kitchen there was a bowl of apricots that had lost their shyness and he ate one over the sink, both of them acknowledging the intimacy of that with a look and no speech.

Julian called while they were mid-pivot and Nora let the call go to voice mail because she wanted to be the person who did not answer the man in linen while there was someone with his hands on the same piece of wood she was wrestling. Later she played it and they stood together and listened to Julian’s voice try for casual and land on a tight wire. He said the press wanted him to talk about “what is broken,” and he did not know how to make a brokenness that everyone loved enough to click on it without turning into a person who points at his own wounds for attention. Ze heard the trouble and felt some sympathy that was not required by any job description. He had seen men stand up in courtrooms and make themselves into a narrative better suited for a festival than a sentencing, and it had never made him feel like a god.

The earring found its sister on a Tuesday in the least poetic way possible. Mrs. Knudsen’s grandniece came into the station with her mother because Mrs. Knudsen had acquired a talent for putting together two things that did not belong together and then naming the result as proof of somebody else’s sin. The girl had been at the night market, and she had a jewelry tree with empty branches, and she had sent a brittle text to a friend at two in the morning the night the gallery was hit again that said, come see what I can do. The earring in the evidence bag looked like the orphaned half of the pair she wore to the courthouse, and when Ze held it up the girl’s mouth made a shape of admiration for the beadwork before she remembered this was not a shop and she was not a customer. It was not slam-click closed, not yet, because the markers on her fingers could have come from anything, and the friend she had texted had a gift for lying with a straight face that made Ze nostalgic for days when he had been easier to fool.

He took the girl into the small room with the wall that made the sound of air change and he asked her about the cuts, the marker, the laugh. She was eighteen and had the stubborn grace of someone who refuses to be embarrassed by the part of herself that loves theater. She said she hated the gallery because her mother loved it and because sometimes when your mother loves a thing it sounds like she is making a speech to the jury of the world and you are the only one who is bored. She said she had not cut anything because you don’t hurt things that are already doing the job of hurting themselves by being pretentious, and he did not allow himself to be charmed because that was not part of the work, but he did allow himself to be a little pleased by the way she swung her sentences. He kept his face neutral because he was tired of the story where grown men imagine themselves equals with teenagers and think that makes them good listeners. He asked for her alibi, wrote down the wrongness in it with the same even pen he used for everything else, and he let the law be the thing it was, slow as granite when it needed to be.

At the reading that week, he sat with his hands clean for once, palms empty, and listened to a kid read a poem about his grandmother’s elbow. He felt something move in his chest that had nothing to do with Nora or his job or the weather, and he considered the possibility that this—this sitting and letting the world come into him with no badge on and no need to steer—might be a form of power he could trust. Helen said his name in the intermission, not as a summons but as a hello, and pulled him into a conversation about residency weeks and what it means to bring work and be asked to leave your certainty at the door. He told her he had always suspected certainty had a big ego and would need to be left in the car anyway, window cracked, and she laughed, an actual laugh that had no match-flick in it and made him feel that rare alignment of being exactly as funny as he meant to be.

He told Nora about the interview scheduled for Friday at two, and she made the face she makes when she wants to leap out of herself and do something for you that cannot be done by anyone else. “Tell them about the cup on the sink,” she said, as if that was a secret weapon. “Tell them about the words you keep not writing because you think they’re too big. I want you to write them and make them small enough to hold.” He wanted to kiss her mouth in that moment more than he wanted hurricane relief in August, and he moved his hand to the back of the chair instead and felt the grain. She saw him, and he saw her seeing, and the restraint warmed him in a way he would have been embarrassed to admit.

When Friday came, he parked two blocks away from the station and sat in the cruiser with the laptop open because he wanted to be a person who changed locations on purpose. He checked the camera to make sure no smear of doughnut or ketchup had claimed his shirt, and he looked at his own face on the small screen and said, quietly, “You can call your hunger by its name.” The panel appeared one by one like stars the app had decided to give him. They were not stars and he was not a ship, but he played along because the metaphor was free.

They asked him about place, the way you’d ask a farmer about weather, and he told them about the way the town speaks with its gulls first and the way a select board meeting can be both comedy and tragedy in one hour. They asked him about time, and he told them about the dull blade and the marker with its little song and the way certain sounds have been added to him like coins you carry without caring for their denomination. They asked him about what he wanted, and he said he wanted to become a person who does not flinch when his own sentences do not apologize for their longing. He said he wanted to become a better neighbor to language. Somewhere in the middle, his radio hissed with a small grumble about a noise complaint, and he shut the sound off with such gentleness that one of the faces in the grid smiled involuntarily, like she loved a man who knows how to take care of a sleeping child.

After, he walked without going anywhere and let the relief go out of him in a long ribbon he didn’t need to hold. Finn found him and clapped him on the shoulder with the precision of a man who had taken up believing in his friend as a hobby. “You say the thing about your mother’s kitchen?” Finn asked, as if this entire town had been in the loop without Ze noticing.

“I did,” he said. “I think it worked.”

“It works on me,” Finn said. “I fight tears every time you talk about lemon zest like it owes you money.”

The answer did not come for two days that felt like the week between Christmas and New Year’s when the country forgets whether it is working. He kept himself the right kind of busy, the kind that involves moving his body and not inventing problems he cannot fix. He went to see Mrs. Alvarez and helped her carry groceries up the stairs, and she gave him a jar of beans she had coaxed into bloom, and he promised to return the jar because he is the kind of man who returns jars even when no one is checking. He found Atlas once more at the edge of the river and stood with the dog and the woman in the hat, three bodies letting the wind give them shapes they had not asked for. He wrote at the table in the evening when the heat had given up its argument for the day, and he did not use the word light once. He wanted to prove to himself that his body could abstain.

The email arrived at four seventeen in the afternoon when the station smelled like cleaning fluid and hot paper. He almost did not open it because there is a superstition among men like him that if you don’t look at a thing it cannot change you. Helen had told him to be brave about good news, and he remembered that the act of opening is sometimes the first duty you owe your own future. The first word was Congratulations, and he barely saw it because the shape of the sentence left a ringing in him that might have been the blood in his ears or might have been something else altogether. He read the rest—dates and intensives and the phrase cohort that he resolved not to make fun of, not even in his head—and he stood up without realizing he had stood up and said, “Harlan,” in a voice that sounded like a man calling a dog who has come home.

They all clapped in a clumsy way because offices clap like that unless they are advertising agencies, and Finn whistled and then apologized to the copier for startling it. Ze texted Tamar a single word and she texted back a string of celebratory objects that had nothing to do with each other except they were all festive, and he laughed and felt his heart make room. He sat down again and put his face in his hands for a second because there are moments when privacy is something you manufacture for yourself with your palms and your breath. When he looked up, the day had not changed, not for anyone else, and that was its own relief.

He walked to Nora’s place after his shift because he was a man who wanted to say a sentence in person and he was learning to be the man who did the thing his want suggested when it did not hurt anyone. She opened the door with a dish towel in her hand and a look that might have meant she had been waiting, and he held up nothing but his face. “I got in,” he said, and she pressed the towel up under her eyes as if she had planned to cry about something else in the kitchen and now the towel could be useful here. She cupped his jaw with her hand and then took it back because their language had not yet included that particular punctuation mark, and they stood in a doorway that reminded both of them of all the other doorways where sentences had begun. She made a sound that was not a word and then made a word. She said, “Good,” with an intensity that made good sound like the word glory would if it were allowed into a secular apartment with a balky stove.

He wanted to kiss her then in a way that was not about triumph but about arrival. He wanted to place his mouth where all the sentences had been forming and see if the world let him keep feeling as if he had learned to hold more than one true thing at once. She must have seen it on him, because even as her hand dropped, she tipped her head as if she were listening to a far-off bell. He could have stepped; he did not. The restraint was not martyrdom; it was a vote for a later that would not be complicated by the story of a door and a rush. “Come in,” she said, and he did, and they sat with their knees almost touching on her small couch and let themselves be the right kind of full.

He told her about the schedule and the residency that would be a week of humidity and seriousness, a little village of lanyards, and she told him that he would walk into that room and know where the oxygen was because he had learned to find it in gymnasiums and select board meetings and kitchens where floor fans make their own weather. They talked about work and money and what it means to plan for being away and what it means to tell the job you will be a slightly different man when you return. They made a list on the back of an envelope of practical items that would take the thrill and give it a chair: forms, time off requests, shoes he could stand in without hating himself.

When he left, it was not late, because they were careful with late. He stood on the sidewalk and listened to the building say nothing and the town say nothing and his body say thank you. He walked past the gallery because sometimes you pass by the sore place to prove you can, and on the window there were remnants of tape from a sign that had outlived its polite commands. Inside, the words on the wall were gone, painted over in a white that did not match the surrounding white, an honest misfit that told the truth about what had happened in that room. He stood with his hands in his pockets and watched his reflection in the glass refuse to settle; it became three men depending on how he leaned. He thought about mirrors and windows and paintings and the way human beings keep trying to be each other’s weather. He was hungry again, that humane and ordinary hunger, and he let it sit with him rather than run him out, and the night gave him back the sound of his own shoes as if to say, make a beat and I’ll keep time.The week after the yes, the letter sat on the table like a polite guest, and he kept walking past it to see if its presence would keep proving itself. He had printed it and folded it with the sort of care that feels superstitious afterward, as if a crease could convince reality to hold. The mornings kept their small, spare glamour; he made coffee as if that daily act were a contract and stirred it slowly enough to watch the swirl have its say. He wrote his schedule out on a card and then rewrote it because his handwriting looked like someone he used to be, and when he was satisfied with the ink, he let himself sit in the chair by the window and just count the gulls in pairs. He called Tamar and let her sing nonsense to him about being proud, and when she said, “Ma would have told the cashier at the corner store and then mailed the cashier a clipping,” he laughed in a way that put space into his ribs.

At roll call, Harlan put his glasses down on the table and looked at Ze the way you look at a person who has carried something heavy without complaint and then tells you they are going to learn wind instruments on the weekends. “We’ll cover you for the week,” Harlan said, tapping the approved time-off form like it was a chest that might hold any number of birds. “I want you to come back with sentences sharper than your duty knife and a willingness to keep not being a pain in my ass.” Finn added, “He’s going to sit in a circle and say ‘craft’ and ‘lens’ and forget us,” and Ze said, “I’ll text when someone says ‘lens’ earnestly,” and Harlan said, “I don’t want to know,” and the room gave him the kind of grin a workplace gives when it wants to be generous and is too proud to perform it fully.

On patrol, the heat behaved like a colleague who talks too loudly and then apologizes with iced drinks. He made note of the corners of town that would need visiting while he was gone, as if the city were a plant that would miss him if not watered. He stopped into Gus’s to pay his bill because it had gotten away from him by exactly seven dollars and change, which Etta remembered as if she had built a ledger into the base of her skull. “Bring me back some big words,” she said, handing him a paper cup because one of the coffee machines was sulking. “I want one I can roll around under my tongue like a jawbreaker.” He wrote multivalent on a napkin and said, “It will stain your teeth,” and she said, “Good,” and tucked it into her apron like treasure.

He kept away from the gallery unless the job put him there, and the job did, because vandalism becomes a rhythm people can’t stop clapping on the off-beat. The second writing had been erased and then clung faintly under the new paint like a ghost that refuses to concede it is a ghost. Ze stood with Julian under the too-cold blast of the industrial unit and asked the questions he had asked before, this time with names added: the grandniece, the friend, the pizza kid, the intern who had the key with a broken plastic head that still worked if you jiggled it. Julian had made a decision to be more careful in his sentences and then kept breaking his own rule because fury kept handing him better words. “Art is a room where people bring their mistakes to see if they can be turned into light,” he said, like a man auditioning for an older version of himself, and then he said, “I don’t want to be in a story they think they’re writing about me,” and Ze nodded because we only get to choose the plot some of the time.

The video from the pizza place ended up being less dramatic than a police show would have wanted and more useful than the camera had any right to be. There was the alley, geometry with a touch of accident, and there were two blurs with shoulders in a hurry and a stutter of light when someone’s phone tilted up to check a message. You could not read faces. You could, if you thought about it long enough, feel a laugh arrive in a body and depart in a ribbon of breath, and when he played the nine seconds back and forth, it kept giving him the same absence of certainty. He wrote the sound into his notebook like you might transcribe a bird call without knowing the name that matches it and then went to find the girls again, because teenagers are resilient and will talk differently each time you walk out and walk back in.

They came to the station reluctantly because reluctance is part of the costume, and they took their seats with their mouths ready for the arithmetic of truth-telling they had been practicing since middle school. The grandniece, Sam, wore a T-shirt with a band name that might have been a password, and her friend, Agnes, had a braid so tight it looked like a decision. He saw the artisan earring in Agnes’s left ear and the new bare lobe on Sam where the pair had been separated by accident or intention, and he felt old and young in the same measure. “We’re not criminals,” Sam said, heading him off at a pass he hadn’t chosen. “We’re bored,” and Agnes added, “And mad,” as if naming emotion were an alibi. He asked them to be patient with his questions and said he would be patient with their answers, and he meant it, and that is usually an advantage.

He asked Agnes about the words on the wall, and she lifted one shoulder in a half-shrug that did not disrespect him so much as the entire category of authority. “People look at a thing and try to see themselves,” she said, and her teenage certainty did not cancel out her insight. “It’s lazy. It’s like they bought a mirror and decided it’s better than a window because it gives them back their own face. I wrote that because I was tired.” Sam said, “She wrote it. I’m not that person,” which was both true and false as all declarations at eighteen tend to be. He did not steer them into confessions with tricks; he did not have tricks. He showed them the earring, and watched a face try not to tell on a heart. He told them what the fines look like and what the courtroom smells like and how long something like this can live in the mouth of a town. He told them there might be another way and did not promise it would feel better.

He took the day and turned it into a slow, careful negotiation between harm and the town’s appetite for spectacle. He called Julian and asked if he could imagine a circle being better than a line, if he could picture sitting with the girls and hearing words that would be clumsy and necessary. To his surprise, Julian did not perform magnanimity; he said, “Only if they want to be in the room,” and when Ze said they had agreed in principle, Julia said, “Then yes. I believe in rooms,” and the sincerity hit Ze in a place he’d thought too old for that particular bruise. He called Helen because in his mind she stood in for the part of the town that remembers how to convene people without making them sorry, and she said the sentence he needed with her usual clarity. “Make the room safe and make it serious,” she said. “Adults think those are opposites. They’re not.”

They borrowed the back of the library because it remembered enough whispers to keep secrets. They did not call it a mediation because that word belongs to policy and makes mouths stiff. The chairs were the color of peaches that have not yet decided to ripen, and the carpet had a tidy pattern that didn’t mind the fact that someone had spilled a soda here last year and blamed the air conditioning. Julian chose a seat and then changed his mind and another, and when the girls came in with their mothers and their two different kinds of fear, they looked like as many people as they needed to be. Nora came because he had asked her, and because the line between town and classroom had always been an alley they both walked down without flinching. She sat not next to him and not next to anyone; she sat a little away, the kind of support that does not claim the center.

Julian said what had been broken, and he did not turn his voice into an instrument. He described the work and the time and the way a slash lives forever in a body because there are scars that do not share skin with us and belong anyway. Agnes said the words about mirrors and windows again, this time less proud of them, and Sam said about the night market and the way attention seems like a water main in summer—always on, always ready to flood. The mothers took turns asking if this could be resolved without the roar, and the town said yes through the mouths of three people who had chosen well that day. They ended with an arrangement that did not satisfy anyone’s hunger for punishment and did a quiet job for fairness; the girls would work at the gallery repairing what could be repaired under supervision, and they would sit for an afternoon while a local teacher led them through readings about art and damage, and they would come back in a month and say what they had learned. It sounded like church and detention because both systems are good at endurance, and Ze watched Nora look at the girls with the particular compassion she reserves for students she can’t save and wouldn’t try to remake into anything but themselves.

On the day he left for the residency, the town consented to be gray for an hour in the morning as if to make the goodbye easier, and then it cleared its throat and resumed being summer. He packed like a person who did not trust hotels to have towels and pillows and ended up apologizing to the suitcase for how much he asked it to carry. The campus was older than his apartment and younger than a cathedral, the trees with the practiced shade of organisms that have hosted academics for generations. People wore lanyards without irony and introduced themselves to strangers as if this was a country where nobody owed taxes. He tried to make his face into a place where people would want to put down their nerves and declare a small piece of themselves safely under new management.

In the first workshop, a man with a beard that needed its own résumé used the word ellipses like he was naming a child, and a woman with elegant glasses said narrative arc with such seriousness he looked around for someone to build scaffolding. Ze read a page about the night market and the smell of dumplings at a moment when he did not think he would be called, because that way the choosing had already been done for him. A young poet named Asha with a voice like polished wood asked him what happens if he writes the word mercy without flinching, and he liked her immediately because she did not say it like a dare but like a suggestion for a better tool. A man in a shirt with tiny anchors wanted to know if Ze thought he could write about the badge without polishing it, and Ze said the shine is not what keeps the metal honest, and the man nodded like he would be quoting that to someone else later. When he walked out of the room into the heat that had been invited in by older buildings that do not host air conditioning as a casual guest, he felt price and worth and a small, deep joy he was not ready to label.

He learned the names in a slow circle, writing them down because he is a person who believes people are someone you can carry. He sat on a stoop at night with a woman named Imogen who used to butcher hogs and now writes about opera, and they traded unlikely vocabularies until they both gave up at the phrase mise en place and accepted that cuisine had stolen the best terms from all the softer arts. He went to a reading in a room with faulty lamps and listened to a person he’d never heard of make people widen their eyes over a sentence about a horse that had seen something it could not forget, and he believed in the bargain again. When someone asked him in passing how he slept after patrol, he did not turn it into a performance about trauma; he said sometimes fine and sometimes not and most of the time I wake up and find the coffee works, and the man nodded because there’s a relief in not having to be the most interesting pain in the room.

He sent Nora a photograph of a bench with initials scratched into it, the letters so earnest they had stopped being vandalism and become part of the wood’s biography. She sent him back a picture of her own chalk hand with the imprint of the eraser on her palm like a cloud that had decided to live there. He kept wanting to write her longer things and then stopped himself because he liked the economy of it, two people saying here, here’s the thing I touched today that touched me. One night he stepped away from the bar where people were arguing about free indirect discourse because his body found it tiring to stand up and pretend to care, and he walked down to a creek that did not know he had expectations and he stepped in up to his ankles and let the cold rewrite him.

The last day, they all sat in a circle and said the kind of things people say when they have been living on a campus diet of starch and intention. Asha read two lines of her grandfather’s letters without explaining why, and someone cried and someone laughed and the air settled into a still, good thing he felt on the back of his neck. He took the train back because he wanted the time to lay itself down in a sequence he could see, and he watched towns with unfamiliar steeples go by and did not resent them their faces. He wrote a paragraph in his notebook that began with the sentence, I want to be the kind of man who calls things by their names, and he underlined be and then put the pen away because underlining can become a habit and he did not want to live in italics.

Back in town, the river welcomed him with its habitual mockery of propriety, and he went straight to the station with a bag of cookies with which he bribed his way back into everyday. Finn told him he’d survived without him but did not enjoy it, and Harlan handed him two messages, one from Helen with congratulations and a suggestion about a reading he should attend, and one from Julian with a date and a time and a note that said, “The girls are coming back to say their piece. If you can be there, be there.” He went by the gallery that afternoon and found the canvases rehung in a way that acknowledged their hurt without selling tickets to the wound; the slashes were visible without being the point. He ran his finger near the edge of a cut, not touching, the muscle memory of withholding anchoring his hand, and he told the brand-new patch of white paint, I see you, even if it does not matter.

The girls were ready the way people are ready when they have decided they will not be humiliated by something that embarrassed them before. Agnes wore a dress that might have been borrowed and stood like she was practicing owning a version of herself, and Sam had a sweatshirt tied around her waist because in New England even in heat you keep a fleece near, as a reflex. They sat with Julian and Helen and Ze and Nora, and the mothers did not sit inside the circle because they had done their job and you have to let the thing be what it is. Agnes said she now could not walk into a room with pictures on the walls without seeing the hands behind the images, and that it made her angrier and softer at the same time, and Sam said the word vandals as if trying it on and deciding not to buy it because it fit ugly. Julian said he had found himself talking less when visitors came in and wanted to be impressed by the damage, and that this had taught him not a little of what it means to be a responsible host. The room breathed in a single, unshowy rhythm. It was not absolution and it was better.

After, on the sidewalk where the late sun examines faces without mercy, Nora took his arm very briefly with a pressure that did not ask his muscles to answer. “Thank you,” she said, and he started to say for what and then did not, because gratitude is often about the furniture we move without taking credit for the dust. They walked toward the river because the body has favorite routes everyone learns without being taught, and when they reached the stone steps she had descended a month ago, she sat and took her sandals off with a care that made him want to look away and did not let him. “Did you keep something from me?” she asked, and the question did not feel like a police light; it felt like a woman who knew she would receive an answer.

He looked out at the water and let his face do what it wanted to, which was be readable. “I did,” he said. “The second sentence. I don’t know why I put it in my pocket. Maybe I wanted to have a thing you’d ask me for later so I could give it to you and have it be a gift. That’s not clean. I’m sorry.” She listened as if learning were better than winning. He told her the words, and when he spoke them, We are paintings, not windows, they sounded less like a declaration and more like a plea. “It made me think about you,” he said, because honesty once begun can be a relief. “About rooms where people stare and think they see what they came for.”

She picked up a pebble and turned it through her fingers as if checking for its story. “I like windows,” she said, not for argument but to set a line. “And I like paintings. I am not fond of mirrors, except the ones that tell me I have paint on my face. I don’t think I need the vandal’s statement to help me be who I am.” She did not scold him for the withholding; she put it away with the files she keeps for moments when names and facts will matter again. “If you keep something next time,” she added, “keep it because it would have harmed me to know it then, not because you want a future gift.” He nodded and felt very much like a student, which had ceased to embarrass him the way it once would have.

They did not head into the store of a kiss on the steps; they sat there until the light rounded off, and then they stood and walked side by side back to the street where they had left their separate lives, and the distance between their hands carried its own message that did not need a public performance. He went home and called Tamar and told her about teenagers and a gallery and how sometimes the town chooses to be tender on a Tuesday, and she said, “It’s a good day when we run out of punishment,” and he wrote the line down because there are gifts you accept even when you can’t use them immediately.

The next days arranged themselves like polite furniture. He went to a select board meeting and watched a man become incandescent over the placement of a speed bump as if it were a crème brûlée that had been torched by an enemy, and he kept his face in its gentle shape because mockery is a corrosive that works faster than you think. He fielded a call about a fox seen near the preschool and explained that the fox had in fact lived here longer than any of them and was not, on its own, a herald of apocalypse. He ran into Atlas again and the dog put his head against Ze’s hip in a way that was a benediction no church had the right to deny, and the woman in the hat told him she had started to say grace some evenings without meaning to, and he said, “Same,” and meant that he had developed a habit of saying the word thank you in different pitches to see which one made the day answer.

A heat advisory came across the radio in a tone that was calm and official as a person reading a bedtime story, and he watched as the town adopted the air of a room with a sleeping child in it, voices dropping, movements mindful. He went up three flights to carry an old box fan down to an older man and refused the ten dollars the man wanted to hand him like a trophy, and when he reached the street, his shirt was a map of someone who had been reminded gravity is part of temperature. He stood in the shade of an elm and let the relief do its work and then he drove to Nora’s with a bag of popsicles because sometimes friendship is sugar on a stick eating itself into cold water. She let him in and they ate on her porch, feet up on the rail the landlord had politely warned about, and their conversation drifted the way popsicle juice finds your wrist, slowly and with little eddies of surprise. When he stood to go, she stood too, and this time the doorframe was only wood and paint, not an altar. They both leaned forward at the same time without choreography, their mouths a study in consent, and when they met, it was not a triumph or the kind of thing a violins section is asked to participate in; it was a sentence two people said together and agreed they had meant.

He walked home in the kind of dark that smells like hot stone, and he did not touch his mouth because he is prone to thinking about symbols and tonight he wanted to let his body be its own $10 word. He lay down without turning on the fan because the sweat had stopped arguing and started to feel like a reminder that he was an animal with needs and answers. In the morning, he woke to the low bray of a ship’s horn on the river, and he let himself imagine it was calling to him by name and not calling to anyone at all. When he made coffee, he did not measure with the righteous arithmetic of a man who believes in proportion. He was generous, and the day took it and did not spill.Chapter 7

The morning wore a new skin, and Ze felt it on his own as if sleep had fitted him with something stitched in a different light. Coffee behaved like a promise rather than a chore, and the spoon sounded a brighter clink against the mug as if it had been waiting for this exact day to audition. He did not put words like after into his head and hang them like decorations in a hallway; he let the ordinary carry the secret. He shaved carefully around a cut he had given himself a week prior and decided not to read meaning into the way the nick had finally closed. His uniform lay on the back of the chair in a gentle, decent heap and he put it on like a man who believes fabric might learn his name. On the way out the door, he glanced at the folded letter on the table and nodded to it, a private salute that had all the dignity of a bow performed for an audience of one.

Finn clocked the change in him like a dog senses weather. “Someone slept,” he said, hauling his chair back with a scrape that declared itself, and Ze let his face be readable because hiding would have been a meanness. “She said yes to a popsicle,” he added, and before Ze could decide how to answer, Finn’s grin widened into something not cruel. “About time,” he said, softer than his jokes, and then Harlan came in and the room put on its weekday seriousness like a uniform of its own. The board meeting was mentioned. The foxes got their turn. The heat advisory turned their paper cups of water into a duty, and the list of addresses had the usual punctuation of birthdays, apartments, and uncooperative air conditioners. Between the lines, Ze held his own sentence and did not let it run around the room making a spectacle of itself.

The town found out about the program the way towns do, by accident and intention and the soft insistence of people who love small news that makes them bigger. The paper ran a tidy four inches with a headline that did not hurt anyone, and Etta slapped the clipping on the pie case with tape that left residue like old gossip. “Celebrity,” she said, pushing him a coffee with a blessing hidden inside. Mrs. Knudsen called to ask if he would be collecting autographs as part of his patrol because her great-nephew wanted to practice handwriting with anything that felt official. At the hardware store, a man named Dale who wore his name on a patch like a birth certificate said, “We’ll get you a little lamp,” and then grinned as if lamps and learning had the same circuitry. There was one voice on the radio show that likes to make the world sensible by narrowing it, the host reading the item and letting his tone do the work of a sneer, and Ze turned the dial not out of cowardice but because he had breakfast to digest and his heart still felt new.

He and Nora made the dinner promise the way people do who believe in the ritual of chopping and salt. He went to the market and bought parsley as if it could testify, and he found the good lemons, the ones that feel like a wrist just before it turns into a hand. He found kummel in a little jar and then put it back because his mother’s spice had never been something you purchased in this town, it had been a scent that clung to sleeves and lived in the seam of a wooden spoon. In Nora’s kitchen, the stove was honest about its temperature and the window over the sink looked at the kind of brick that has learned to accept light without needing to remake it. He zested like a man returning an old debt and the smell stepped forward and kissed his face in a way that startled him, and he told her about his mother with the clean truth of a man who will never be done telling. Nora cut onions and did not cry, and when he asked if she was some kind of witch she said, “No, I learned a trick with the knife,” and he believed her because the world is full of tricks you learn too late.

Their talk moved as if it had its own knees. She told him about the button boxes again and then told him the story she had not managed before, the one where her mother discovered that sorting made grief quieter and how she had taught the girls to stack buttons not by size but by the light they borrowed from the hour you look at them. He told her a new version of his father, the one where the suitcase had been repaired so many times that tape had become a kind of family emblem, and he made the joke he had never made aloud—“Our coat of arms is duct”—and watched her laugh with a hand to her chest like she was trying to catch the laugh before it startled the neighbors. They ate quietly for a minute because food sometimes asks for attention you owe it, and the cumin walked through the room like someone you recognize from an old photograph. When she took his plate to the sink and stood there rinsing it, he watched the way her shoulder moved under her sleeve and thought he might recognize the choreography of this forever and not be bored.

He kept his promise to step lightly around the gallery, and still the case found him sometimes in a way that felt like a dog nosing at your shoe. Agnes and Sam worked under a graduate student from the art department who had a patience you could measure in a room by sticking a thermometer under the windowsill and checking the way the air didn’t spike. The girls learned the proper way to carry a canvas, which is like carrying a sleeping child you do not own, and they learned that repair is work that does not call itself heroism. Julian learned to say less and mean more, and when Ze stood in the doorway with his hands visible and his voice set to a temperature that wouldn’t harm anyone, the four of them looked like a room learning manners in a society worth belonging to. He did not stay long; courtesy had its own clock here, and he had another place to be.

The first fire of the week did not look like fire as much as a story about the way heat sneaks under old paint and tries to restore itself to drama. A narrow brick building in the part of town where the air smells like rope and stale varnish had a workshop on the second floor, an upholsterer whose name had worn through the vowels and become something softer and older. Rags had been stacked in a way that would have been fine in February and faithless in August, and when the world leaned on them, they betrayed. The sprinkler system did its broken best and then shrugged, and when Ze climbed the stairs with the firefighters, the room smelled like a letter from a relative you wanted to like but didn’t know well enough yet, smoke and glue and old foam noises. The man who worked there held in his hands a ledger so saturated it looked like grief had learned to be paper, and he said his name in a way that told Ze he had not been asked his name in a way that listened for a while. “Abdallah,” he said, and Ze said, “Zehavit,” and the man’s mouth changed shape as if the syllables had pushed a door open. They stood there among the smolder and exchanged their brief archive of roots, not to perform but to locate each other, and Ze had the sense, foolish maybe, that somewhere his mother leaned in the way she would lean when she thought a story was about to get good.

By the time the child went missing at the street fair, the town had put back on its cheerful face because smoke had not upped the rent on hope. The call came with that hot metallic taste he now associated with every public strip of grass in summer, and when Ze reached the stage, the singer had stopped singing because mothers command silence with their bodies even when they do not intend to. The kid’s name was Theo and the mother said it like a prayer and a curse and a grocery list of possible futures, and Ze did not let his bigness become a threat. He crouched and met her eye the way you meet a person at a window, and he asked the questions that matter to children—what does he like to hide behind, does he run toward sound or away, does he know the names of birds. They found Theo where most of these stories end, in a place that had made sense only to him; he had crawled behind the plywood skirts of the stage to visit a spider the size of his hand. Ze lay on his side and talked to him with his cheek against the dusty floor and said, “Theo, you are very brave and that spider has an appointment,” and the boy backed out with the gravity of a diver, triumphant because he had been allowed to keep his bravery. The mother’s sound on reunion was softer than the river’s singing in spate, and Ze stepped away and let their bodies make the only circle in the world that matters in that moment.

There was the article, of course, the one that made a neat trick out of work and appetite. Cop Poet, the headline suggested the way a magician suggests there might be a coin behind your ear, and Ze felt the weirdness of seeing his face next to nouns that refuse to stop being abstract. He had tried very hard not to be a man whose bio line tells strangers what stories to expect. He did not resent the writer; she had been kind and had asked fewer stupid questions than he had braced for. He resented the way the words sat together as if they had always belonged, and he worried about the badge’s feelings, ridiculous even to him. Harlan printed the thing and pinned it to the corkboard with an expression that was part father and part municipal bureaucracy, and said, “Don’t let this make you weird,” and Finn, reading over his shoulder, said, “He’s already weird,” and Ze accepted the insult as medicine.

Tamar came up on a Saturday with the kind of bag you pack when you are prepared to transform any house into a clinic of the heart. She brought with her a small box of cassettes they had not listened to since one broke in the player and wound a ribbon of father’s voice around the capstan like intestines in a horror movie. They sat at his table with a once-good boombox she had rescued from a closet, and they made a ceremony of it without becoming unbearable. The tape they chose had a date on it, a year when Ze was still learning to make his body into a shape the world wanted, and his father’s voice came through with the fuzz of distance and the treble of a man trying to sound more certain than he felt. He was teaching them a song he had made up about the months, and at the end he coughed and you could hear him turn away from the microphone like a gentleman. Tamar snorted and then cried and then snorted because of the crying, and Ze sat with his elbows on his knees and felt the good ache of grief that has been allowed to grow up and pay its own rent.

They met Nora at the coffee place that has plants practicing their diction in the window, and Tamar saw in Nora the thing Ze hadn’t known he wanted anyone to see—the intelligence that doesn’t sharpen itself on other people. Tamar asked questions you can’t ask because the world doesn’t usually give you enough quiet for them, and Nora answered in the way she teaches, with a generosity that does not require confession to prove itself true. They traded mothers like artifacts, each woman talking about buttons and spices and the winters they had not forgiven, and they did not mention fathers because too many ghosts at a table makes the chairs less comfortable. After, walking, Tamar looped her arm through Ze’s the way she used to when his shoulders were the only high ground she trusted, and she said, “I like her because she keeps her magic and doesn’t try to turn it into a sale,” and he felt a whole new trunk of air open in his lungs.

The hurricane watch ad-libbed its way into the afternoon forecasts the way the word actually enters a poem even when nobody invited it. The map on the screen looked like a language exercise for children as the cone widened and narrowed without apology, and the town began its small preparations that it calls courtesy. People filled bathtubs as if they might remember being horses and needing troughs. Stores made pyramids of water bottles and then pretended to be surprised when the pyramids disappeared. Ze checked on the old men who live alone and pretend they are colonies, and he listened to one of them refuse to leave his apartment because he had earned the right to be stubborn. He made a list and then another, this one of who would take which calls if the streets became rivers and the rivers got ideas. He went home and taped the windows in an x, not because it helps but because superstition feels like last-minute study even when you know the exam will not ask about this.

They were going to have dinner with Julian because sometimes the town writes the sentence for you and you can either become a subordinate clause or you can be the subject and own the verb. It was Nora’s suggestion, made with a composure Ze recognized as a braid of bravery and boredom with the choreography of avoidance. “I don’t want the story to make us into cowards,” she said, standing in his kitchen with a dish towel practicing its folds, and he said all right because she had said us and that word, used exactly when it was right to use it, has efficient magic. Julian opened the door wearing a shirt the color of skimmed cream and an expression that suggested he had seized the chance to practice being human for a day. The apartment was all corners you forgive because the art on the walls does not forgive you back, and the table was set in the style of a man who has learned, via the hard school of breakups and openings, how to make four plates and two kinds of glass feel like they had a conversation planned.

They talked about the storm because talking about weather is a way of admitting you all share a roof even when the roof is an idea. Julian cooked fish that had been named in another language first, which seemed appropriate, and Ze’s body did not behave like a rival’s. He behaved like a man whose heart had learned to be this kind of neighbor. Julian asked about the program in a tone that had not been written by jealousy, and Ze answered with just enough content that anyone listening would be able to tell he was not doing a performance of his own goodness. Nora told a story about a student who had compared Bartleby to a modern app that declines to deliver your groceries and they all laughed because metaphors are our only real religion sometimes, and it feels good to watch one work. When the lights flickered, all three of them looked toward the window in the choreography of people who have lived in old buildings, and when the lights stayed, they pretended they had not been interested in the drama at all. On the way out, Julian put a hand on Ze’s arm with a pressure that said thank you for not being a man who needs me to fail to feel tall, and Ze let the compliment sit in his sleeve and warm him there.

The night of the storm itself did not come all at once like an omen. It came in parts, with rehearsals, and then, when it arrived, it did so without introductions. Ze parked the cruiser nose-out because he has learned that is what you do, and he kept a towel folded on the passenger seat in the old superstition he had invented the first summer he had handled a real emergency, and he checked in with Finn every hour until they both stopped pretending it was necessary. Calls stacked up and then peeled off; a tree leaned the wrong way on Lincoln; a basement filled itself with history and then turned the page. He waded into a lobby where a woman on the fourth floor had decided to make coffee as an announcement of sovereignty and had been startled by the sudden absence of electricity, and he brought her down the stairs with his flashlight and the voice he uses when telling someone not to be ashamed of how afraid they feel. The river swelled with the incredible talent all bodies of water have to take over your life, and he stood in that damp air and did the arithmetic of who would be where when the lights returned.

At two in the morning, the call came from a row of buildings not far from Nora’s, and he felt every muscle insist on believing they were all only muscles and not a map. The roof was arguing with itself about whether it still belonged on the building and the wind, an old instigator, kept challenging the rafters to a duel, and the hallway smelled like plaster sadness. Nora stood in the doorway with her landlord, a man who had once been promisingly young and now had the look of someone who had discovered properties do not love you back, and she had a sweatshirt over her nightshirt and a steadiness in her face that did not perform. “We’re fine,” she said before he asked, not because she needed to be brave for him but because she believed in not wasting anyone’s emergency. He walked the stairs and checked the roof and spoke with the crew and jotted notes that would later become forms no one born has ever loved, and when he came back down she was still in the doorway and the landlord was talking about tarps in a tone that suggested tarps might be saints if you get to know them. She reached out and touched the edge of his jacket, two fingers, not to hold him but to reassure her own balance, and he made the old animal sound that means I am here even when I am elsewhere, low in his throat and private. He left because work is a jealous companion, and she closed the door softly, as if being kind to the hinges might help.

In the morning, the world did that thing it does where it pretends it never lost its temper. Branches were proof that the night had not been a dream, and everyone suddenly remembered that brooms are useful tools and not just props in stories about witches. The river had the modesty of someone who has done something dramatic in a party and now wants to be forgiven quietly. Ze stood with Finn and the other two who had worked through and they divided the town into quadrants with a care that could almost be called affection. At the gallery, one pane had cracked but held, and Julian’s plants were being held in the arms of a neighbor who could be trusted to water them as if they were guests. Agnes and Sam arrived in rubber boots because their mothers had more sense than their daughters, and they looked at the broken window with the compassion of perpetrators who have learned where their pronouns must change. Ze watched them sweep glass as if it were a lesson with a test later, and he checked the evidence of the night to be sure the storm was the only vandal who had behaved itself.

He wrote the storm that afternoon in those hours that appear between responsibility and hunger like a door someone has left on the latch. He wrote not the rain but the sound of a tree deciding to let go and the way a second-floor window held a square of candlelight like a small theater in an unfashionable part of town that insists on showing productions it believes in. He wrote the woman with the coffee and his own hands, unfamiliar to him when they curled around the handle of her thermos to steady it while the stairwell turned into a rumor. He did not write the two fingers that touched his jacket because there are objects you carry only long enough to kiss before you set them down where they will be safe. When he read the piece at the series the following week, people listened as if the story was something they had all been a part of and now wanted to see from across the street, and he felt that particular joy you do not speak of, the one where the town and the page climb into the same small boat and decide to paddle toward something kind.

After the reading, a man approached him with a slowness that made Ze love him in advance. “I wanted to say,” the man said, and his hand did not reach for Ze; it hovered like a bird considering a branch, “I wanted to say thank you for not making yourself a movie. You could have, and you didn’t.” Ze made the sound that deflects credit without despising it, and the man nodded as if to seal the agreement. Nora found him near the door and took his program from him and folded it in half and in half again before tucking it into his pocket as if to say, I will keep the smallest parts of this safe if you do not mind. They walked out into air that had the good clean taste of a thing rinsed twice, and when they reached the corner she did not look to see if anyone was watching and he did not look either, and their kiss was not about bravery but about the way relief and desire can share a body and not run each other off the land.

He found, afterward, that his writing wanted to change. It wanted to have fewer ornaments and more floorboards. He allowed it, suspicious and pleased, and sent a paragraph to Helen who answered with exclamation points that would have offended him a year ago and now felt like the correct punctuation for a kind of gratitude that does not know where to put its hands. He sat with Mrs. Alvarez and let her tell him about her youngest moving to Florida where the air is not honest about its wetness, and he agreed to take the fan up to the old man on the second floor again because the motor had developed a new, experimental sound. He saw Atlas on a day that smelled like the inside of a bell and scratched the dog’s ruff until the animal blessed him with the full weight of his head, a priest without an altar but not without authority. In the doorway of Gus’s, Etta handed him a slice of something that might have been cake and might have been an apology from the oven, and he ate it with his eyes closed because sometimes you accept grace that way.

The call that came late did not announce itself with sirens or capital letters. It was a quiet ring from a number he recognized from the station’s list of households that pass trouble around like a bowl of beans and call it dinner. Agnes, her name unmuffled by anyone else’s voice, came through with the steadiness that sometimes replaces panic when you have used panic too often. “Sam’s not answering,” she said, not trying to harden herself into someone old, “and her mother says she went out after the storm when the town was full of people looking at damage, and nobody has seen her in hours.” Ze stood up in his small apartment and the chair made a sound like apology, and he said he would be there because sometimes the town takes all the classrooms you have built and asks you to use them at once. He put on his jacket because ritual helps, and he reached for the towel on the passenger seat and folded it again because order has its own small weather, and he stepped into a night that was finished pretending and had gone back to being itself, a place with sidewalks and a few birds sleeping with their heads hidden under their own wings. He told the radio where he was going and he told the inside of his chest what he would try not to do, which was to think of all the sentences he had loved in the last week and make them a barricade. He would not barricade. He would open. He would walk toward whatever story the night decided to hand him and hold out both hands as if for a child coming down off a kitchen chair.Chapter 9

The street had been combed flat by wind and then smoothed by rain, and the town wore the shine of a thing recently handled. Puddles held small sections of sky like they were collecting rent, and the storefronts wore their dark as if they’d finally agreed to go to bed. Ze drove with the windows cracked, letting the air say its piece—wet wood, old leaves, the faint residual bite of ozone that makes you believe the storm is still somewhere telling another neighborhood its story. When he turned onto Sam’s block, the porch lights had coordinated in a quiet conspiracy, lit in a sequence that resembled hope. He parked nose-out, habit talking in the body louder than thought, and he took the steps two at a time because the space between ring and door open is sometimes a kindness you don’t collapse.

Agnes met him with the kind of control you borrow from a grown-up and wear like it’s yours. She had her braid loosened now, tendrils gone feral around her ears, and her eyes kept trying to take inventory of a room that refused to hold still. Sam’s mother stood a little behind, her mouth at that point weather assigns to people who are not deciding what to feel but what to do. The kitchen was crowded in the manner of kitchens called into service: a bowl with a spoon in it left mid-stir, a towel stretched to dry over the back of a chair, a phone face-down as if anyone had the power to silence its ideas.

“What was she wearing?” Ze asked, the string of questions running through him with the practiced patience of an old litany. “Shoes? Jacket? Did she bring a bag? Phone?”

Agnes ticked off answers as if they were a test she’d studied for. “Black hoodie, the one with the torn cuff she won’t let me mend; shorts; high-top sneakers with paint on the laces; she had her phone but it’s…not answering.” She swallowed as if the word dead refused to be used for a battery. “She left after dinner because she wanted to see how the storm had ‘moved things around,’” and her voice went briefly soft on the way she mimicked her friend’s speech, a sudden mercy inside accuracy.

Sam’s mother handed over the kind of details you get from living in the same apartment with someone who resists being measured—playlist of the year she thought made sense to her more than the rest, the place where she tucked the move tickets from the gallery into a book of poems and then denied she had, a habit of climbing anything that looks like a choice. “She likes roofs,” her mother said, apology and pride running a relay behind her eyes. “She thinks better up high.”

“Friends hear from her?” Ze asked, looking at Agnes because teenagers are the first responders for each other’s silence. “You two,” he added, “you still sharing locations?” It was a question he had learned to ask like a brother and not a badge.

Agnes nodded and then shook her head, both truths. “We were,” she said. “She turned it off last week because she said she wanted the town to not know her routes. I told her that was ridiculous because the town is nosy and has maps, and she told me to respect the poetry of the thing.” She winced like someone who had practiced that argument with herself and always lost the playback.

“Any favorites?” Ze asked. “Particular roofs? Spots you go when the hour doesn’t know its own name?”

“The school,” Agnes said. “The loading dock ladder is stupid and rusty and she knows how to kick it to make it behave. The municipal lot on High—above the stairwell where the light is always broken. And the theater, backstage, under the risers, even when there’s nothing to hide from. She says the dust there knows how to keep company.” She looked at her own hands as if they might have hidden directions written in chalk.

Ze put a hand on the back of a chair because chairs are where the body rests its heat when it wants to be useful. He looked at the mother. “I’m going to walk some loops,” he said. “Finn’s on. I’ll call him to head toward the water. You stay near the phone. If she texts anyone, if anyone texts you, call me before you call the man who undoes the world with his radio voice. This town will try to make it a show,” he added, not unkind, “and we can make it a smaller thing first.”

On the steps he called Finn and got exactly what he expected: “Already at the river,” Finn said, breath audible, the water making itself known in his tone. “Two kids at the pier, no fear in their knees, I shooed them like pigeons. Want me at the high school after?”

“Yeah,” Ze said. “I’m checking the lot on High and the gallery. She likes heights. She turned off location. Agnes is with me for a round. I’ll drop her back after I look where she tells me. If you see anything that feels like a breadcrumb, grab it gentle.”

The municipal lot’s top deck reflected the sky the way a dull spoon reflects a face. The broken stairwell light had been broken for so long it had graduated into a story about itself, and the breeze up there had learned to weave around parked cars like a visitor who has memorized an unfamiliar floor plan. Agnes walked ahead of him and then checked herself, coming back to his side because pacing with an adult is a learned choreography. She pointed to the corner where the low wall had been chalked once with a dozen small lines like tally marks, and a word in a teenager’s handwriting—Look—faded to a suggestion. “She sits here when she wants to hear people without being obligated to say anything,” Agnes said. “She calls it eaves-resting.”

Ze looked over the edge at the town he knew better than any metaphor. The river licked at its own banks. The bricks kept being themselves. Somewhere a generator hummed unrepentantly. On the low wall near the chalk a scrap of snack wrapper stuck, and he plucked it off and pocketed it because if you want teenagers to trust you, you pick up trash using your hands instead of your mouth. He pictured the path from here to the gallery, the alley with its arrogant balconies, the back door that had been forced twice by fingers drunk on their own intentions. He did not want Sam to have that kind of loop inside her, but desire does not cancel geometry.

The gallery at night contained a different science than daytime. It held its darkness like a deep breath it was proud of sustaining, and the repaired window took the ambient light and refused to argue with it. Ze let Agnes stop on the sidewalk, her body a line he did not cross without her decision. “She came here yesterday morning,” Agnes said, not looking at him. “I shouldn’t have let her. The assignment was the gallery, but I knew it would be mostly sweeping and quiet and maybe that’s what she needed. She kept picking up the little curls of paint like they were shells and she was going to make an altar. Julian was decent. He said ‘hi’ like a person says ‘water.’” She touched her braid the way you test a memory for its temperature. “She kept looking at the white paint.” Agnes pointed. “You can see where it’s not the same. She said it was proof that nothing pretends well enough if you’ve known it intimately.”

Ze put his hand on the cool of the glass, not quite touching. He saw his own face looking serious because it had a job and refused to stop having it even when the job shifted to something softer. He resisted the impulse to cup his eyes and peer in because the business of the night was not to turn itself into a private tour. The alley coughed up the smell of wet cardboard and old cigarettes and the metallic sweetness of paint that had never intended to become a symbol. He scanned the corners with his flashlight, the beam trained to move like a knife that never cut. A tag on the cinderblock showed a new hand—looped letters, careful and shy. “Tell her to hate me,” it said in tiny script, and he felt the teenage theatre of it without mocking the politics. He took a picture because memory overpromises when the hour gets in the way.

They circled toward the high school, the big box of a building that still managed old grace when the night agreed to be theatrical. The loading dock ladder had indeed learned to perform and then sulk, and Agnes showed him the kick that made it behave—a knuckle at the second rung, sharp and sideways—and Ze filed the trick away with the tenderness of a man collecting the town’s small keys. “I’m not telling you this to impress you,” Agnes said, reading him correctly. “I’m telling you because if you ever lecture us about danger, I want to be able to tell you you’re late.”

“I am late often,” he said, deadpan, and she smiled with the unsteady permission that passes for relief. He climbed the ladder slowly, testing each rung because he has learned to let his weight be an argument the metal wins. The roof was slick with the storm’s old skin, not treacherous so much as insistent. He stood with his knees slightly bent and let his own balance teach him. At the far edge, someone had left a milk crate as a stool for the view. A fresh footprint stamped the tar, small and certain, the tread of a high-top with a chip of green paint caught in one block. He crouched to look closer, the tar tacky enough to get intimate. Agnes stood a yard back, disciplined in the art of not yelling in case a name unbalancing the air became the wrong kind of influence.

“Sam?” Ze called, not a shout, more the way you greet someone in a library when you’re not sure if they want to be found. The wind moved across the roof with good manners. A gull on the stadium light three fields over shifted its weight like an old man testing a bench. No one answered and no one not answering felt like an answer.

On the ground again, Agnes’s phone vibrated the small nonsensical rhythm that means a teenager’s social corner has hiccuped. She glanced and then bit her lip. “Her last text to me before she left,” she said, “I didn’t see it right away, I was doing dishes and my mom has this thing about the sink being clean at night,” and she scrolled until she found it and handed it over, the trust again like a gift you can bruise if you hold wrong. The message was three words and a link: I’m painting over. The link didn’t work anymore, a story that had been taken down for violating a platform’s rules or someone’s temper. Underneath, a little heart Sam had put there herself, as if to coach her friend into not worrying.

“You think she means the gallery?” Ze asked, handing the phone back with the care he gives to photographs of children and baptismal certificates. “That wall’s already been painted. Maybe there’s somewhere else that holds the words.”

“She means herself,” Agnes said, flat and bright, the teenage ability to cut through adult metaphor with the healthier version. “But she also means the underpass by the shipyard. There’s a mural there some guys spray-painted last spring, dolphins beating up a shark, it’s stupid and violent and she has wanted to fix it since April.”

The underpass smelled like damp chalk and old gum. The mural wore a layer of street dust that tried to make its colors equal to brick, and the water had crept up here the night before and receded, leaving a hemline mark like a dress that needs altering. With the flashlight low and sideways, Ze saw it—the overlay, tentative and new. A wash of white laid like apology over the shark’s teeth, the shape of a handprint where the roller ran dry, and up high, too high for Agnes, a letter begun and abandoned. W, the old, reliable start to so many words. The ladder leaned against the retaining wall, not abandoned so much as paused, and a small backpack sat a few feet away with its mouth open enough to show a plastic jar of cheap paint and a brush whose hair had given up organization.

“Sam?” Ze said, aloud now, voice moving under the road the way water finds the unseen channels. He shone the light up and the beam found a sneaker sole and the soft skin above an ankle and Sam’s face in profile, angular with purpose, perched on the top rung and hooking her elbow over the edge like she was trying to pull herself into a pocket the wall didn’t know it had. She startled not because she had been afraid but because her project had been interrupted by the person she hadn’t accounted for. “I’m almost done,” she said, defensive and sheepish at the same time, and she sounded like sixteen in a way that made Ze’s chest unclench.

“I don’t need you to be done,” he said, stepping forward and putting his hand on the ladder, the universal signal of someone who cares about physics. “I need you to decide to come down. The rung you’re on is a liar. You can fix the world once your feet are on the ground.”

She looked down at Agnes, and they did that thing girls do, telling an entire story with their faces without letting a single sentence hit the air. Sam’s eyes glittered, not with tears, exactly, but with that bright awareness that arrives when your plan meets a border. “It’s ugly,” she said, nodding at the dolphins and the shark, as if Ze were going to argue. “It’s stupid. It’s boys drawing violence for sport. I wanted to make it so that when kids walk under here they don’t learn that teeth are the hero.” The W up high waited, stubborn. “I was going to write ‘We are not your metaphor.’”

“Good sentence,” Ze said, because credit given correctly is its own ladder. “Also a lot of paint for someone on a rung I don’t trust. Come down and you can pick a wall that doesn’t lie.” He felt the ladder vibrate with the tiny shifts in her weight as she tested her decision and then conceded to it. When she reached him, he put a hand lightly on the back of the rung above her feet, a stupid, ancient move that made him feel less superstitious. On the ground she looked smaller and also more herself, her face opening and then shutting again like a store that remembers its hours too late.

“I didn’t answer,” she said to Agnes without being asked, and then to Ze, “I’m not missing. I was doing something.” Her chin came up, the defiance born of knowing you are in trouble and deciding to make the trouble worth it.

“I believe you,” Ze said, which is not the same as saying you’re not responsible for the belief. “Your mother wants to hear your voice. That’s the first thing. Second, ladders are liars. Third, Agnes gets to tell you how she felt when you didn’t answer. Fourth, the town will still be here when you want to paint on a Saturday morning the way sunlight seems to ask for it.”

Agnes made a noise that could have been a laugh if it had gotten past her sternum. “I know where to get rollers,” she said, and Sam’s shoulders dropped half an inch, the relief of being met with pragmatism. The girls did the small shoulder bump that friends do when they cannot be entirely tender in front of a man with a badge. Sam’s phone was at thirty percent and sulking. She powered it up. The group chat bloomed with other people’s small experiences of the storm, and she looked briefly overwhelmed by the sheer number of heads in her pocket.

They walked together back toward the street, and Ze kept the backpack in his hand because sometimes the body needs to be given proof it has done something. In the yellow light that had not yet remembered the guilt of fluorescent, Sam’s mother stood at the corner, hair loose, face untidy with the honest version of panic. She did not perform a tantrum; she put both hands on Sam’s shoulders and touched her forehead like a person who believes heat is information. Ze stepped away without making a show of it and kept his eyes on the gap in the curb where the water had run back to its larger body. Not far down, a frog called up the ditch with the ridiculous optimism the species insists on.

“You okay?” he asked Agnes a minute later, when their mothers and daughters gave them permission to proceed by forgetting they were there. She nodded and then shook her head, both again. “She keeps trying to be art history,” she said. “I keep wanting her to be what she is. I don’t know where to put my own anger. It’s a terrible storage problem.”

“Some people have attics for that,” he said. “Some of us rent a small unit with a roll-up door and pay by the month. You’re allowed to be angry at her for being the person you love.” Agnes made a face like she wanted to argue with his metaphor and then decided to let it sit in the sun.

“Is she going to get arrested again?” she asked, and the line they were walking converted itself briefly into a tightrope.

“Not tonight,” he said. “Tonight she is a person. Tomorrow she is still a person. The painting over…we can make it into a plan. Come up with a way to not make the town our enemy before we’ve even invited it to like the new wall.” He looked back at the white wash on the shark, the mouth now a clumsy smile, the beginnings of mercy laid in cheap pigment. There was a rough sweetness to it that would make half the city ridiculous in their indignation and the other half quietly grateful the next time a four-year-old asked them about the teeth. “We’ll talk to the city,” he added, already hearing the arguments about graffiti and permission and the cost of paint and the sanctity of dolphins beating up anything.

He walked the girls home and let their footsteps become a conversation that didn’t need him. When he reached his own stairs, he sat on them for a minute and let his shirt cool on his back, the cotton pulling warmth out of him like thread. A cat walked across the street with the haughty efficiency of a person who never doubts they are being watched. He called Finn and said, “We found her,” and Finn said, “Good,” in a way that said his own night would behave now that this had been decided. He called Harlan and said a version that fit into the formal jargon, a tidy little container labeled located safe, and Harlan said, “Write it,” not because he needed the paper but because the act of writing sometimes helps a day organize itself.

In the apartment, the fan had done its small work. He stood with his palms against the edge of the sink and considered water as a moral agent and then chose not to make a sermon about it in his own head. He could feel the hunger that had spent the last few weeks learning to tell time—the one for Nora—make itself known without impatience. He sent her a message that read simply, Found her painting kindness on a bad mural, the town is absurd, and he put the phone face down and let her decide if the hour asked for a reply. He plated out bread and cheese and a handful of almonds like someone throwing small, edible ropes to a ship that had come in and needed securing.

When Nora knocked, he was surprised but not, as if there is a timetable shared by two bodies that do not require slipping envelopes under each other’s doors. She had a sweater thrown over the night shirt he recognized from the hallway and hair that had said no to combs and yes to weather, and she stepped in with her palm flat in the air, an old world peace between them. “Agnes texted me,” she said. “She said you taught the ladder a lesson with your voice.”

“The ladder learned something,” he said. “I am not sure about me.”

They sat on the floor because chairs sometimes elevate a moment into a status it doesn’t need. He told the story in three paragraphs, none of them longer than a chair leg, and when he reached the part where Sam had said, I’m painting over, Nora shook her head with a fondness that would have embarrassed the wrong person. “Of course,” she said. “Of course she is trying to write the sentence that will argue with the world. She is my student even when she is not my student.” She took the piece of bread he handed her, the one with a smear of butter like a quiet decision, and she ate it with a care that made him believe both in food and in the appetite that confers decency.

He told her about the W high up and the shark with its new blunted teeth, and she laughed softly, the sound a string plucked under a hand that knows where the note is hiding. “I’ve been trying to teach the freshmen that art is not kinder merely because it replaces sharpness with clouds,” she said, “and I am also telling them that you do not owe the worst stories permanent residence. Maybe we’ll make a field trip and bring rollers.” She leaned her head back against the cabinet and closed her eyes and he watched the pulse at her throat behave like a small metronome counting out the time in a song he liked.

“You okay?” she asked without opening her eyes, and he could tell she meant both the night and the larger geography of things.

“I am practicing,” he said. “Sometimes it feels like playing scales. Sometimes it feels like the piece itself.” He reached for her hand and did not take it. He set his palm down on the floor next to hers and let the gravity do what it has always been willing to—pull two things toward each other without requiring vows. She tipped her fingers until they touched his knuckles, a brief, unsilly contact that made the room seem both smaller and a place that could hold it.

Later, at the table where paper found him when it wanted to, he wrote the report, the official one, and he wrote the other one, the private account that included the W and the way Agnes had said storage problem and how the road above the underpass carried the sound of tires like low rain. He made no promises to himself about changing anyone’s mind. He allowed himself exactly the hope that felt sane—that Sam would wake on Saturday and still want to paint for the kinder version of the city, that Agnes would answer her messages without checking for knives first, that the mural might find itself improved not because adults granted permission but because the town learned something about itself with brushes in hand. He put the papers away and sat for a minute in the dark before finding his bed, listening as the refrigerator hummed a note that harmonized without trying.

In the morning, the gulls came back to rehearse their announcements in the same ordinary white. He woke with the sense that the world had returned itself to him in the correct number of pieces, no spares. Coffee did its clean work. He took the long loop to his mother’s spice drawer in his head and took out the jar that had cumin’s ghost in it and shook that memory over the egg like a blessing. The badge lay on the counter where he had left it, a star in a less-than-heroic light, and he pinned it on because everyone is better when they admit what they stand for, even if it changes hour to hour. At Gus’s, Etta waved him to the counter without asking if he was whole because she assumes you are and will feed the broken parts without ceremony. “We got a herd of rollers in the back,” she said, dropping toast like it was a coin that had been waiting in her palm. “Guy from hardware brought them because he heard we were turning sharks into something less tooth-forward. Tell your girls to come by before someone uses them to paint their own porch.”

He smiled into his coffee. The town had decided, for a breath-long moment, to be extra useful. On the way to the station he drove past the underpass and saw two women in city shirts standing with their hands on their hips and their heads tilted, the official stance of people considering policy’s brief vacation. A kid on a bike slowed and watched them as if they might break into dance. The white on the shark’s mouth had dried streaky but optimistic. Above it, in thick paint now because someone had brought the right tool, the finished sentence marched across the concrete: We are not your metaphor. It looked less like defiance than like literacy, a declaration about who gets to be turned into what.

The day’s list had the usual items—car mirror taken off by a driver who did not stop, a neighbor convinced the recycling bins were plotting their overthrow, a request from Harlan to pick up paperwork at City Hall because he refused to let the mail carry anything that had been signed by a person whose name he did not respect. Agnes texted him a picture of Sam asleep with her arm over her face like a person refusing to be found even by light, and added, We’re going at ten, we got permission, Helen is coming because she said we’re not doing public art without a reader on hand, and he laughed because of course. He texted Nora a photograph of the rollers lined up on the diner’s back step like a row of small soldiers and wrote, Recruitment continues, and she sent back a paint-smeared thumb and the words: I’m bringing cookies for morale and a lecture in my pocket in case anyone asks for it by name.

He was halfway to the school when Harlan said his name in the voice that narrows the world, and he turned the wheel not because he knew what waited but because he has made a practice of arriving. A man had fallen off a ladder painting his own garage in a kind of healthy skepticism of contractors, and the ladder lay there on the driveway in a pose that suggested shame and the man looked up at the sky like he was deciding whether to argue with it directly. Ze knelt and used the voice that makes pain remember it is not the only occupant of a body. He asked where it hurt and the man said it hurt in the memory of having been young and stronger, and Ze said he had a salve for that called a joke later and something stoic now, and the paramedics appeared like a plan that had decided finally to approve itself.

At the underpass, when he got there, a modest crowd had gathered with the manners of people who have chosen daytime for their drama. Helen had a clipboard she did not need and the air of a person who will make a meeting out of anything if it will save someone from embarrassment. Julian, inevitably, had shown up with a bucket of a better white because he refuses to let poor materials declare themselves artists, and he kept his mouth shut in a way that felt like a good evolution. Sam stood on a low aluminum ladder that had been inspected by three adults and Agnes held the tray steady with both hands as if contributing steadiness to the world were a job you could list on a résumé. Nora arrived with cookies and a rag in her back pocket and she took one look at the W and nodded once, solemn, a professor blessing in the wild.

“Rules,” Helen said, not unkind and not in love with her own authority. “No names unless they’re claimed. No lectures unless invited. No photographs of faces. Paint slow.” A little boy with a train shirt said, “Can I yellow?” and his mother said, “We’ll ask,” and Nora crouched to show him a small circle down low where sun would be welcome, and he began with a seriousness that would make anyone wish institutions could be replaced with that kind of attention. The old man with the fan upstairs had come, because of course, and he leaned on his cane and asked if he might hold a roller for a minute, and Ze put it in his hand and the old man nodded like the weight was respectable.

They painted until the white found its edges, until the old image didn’t disappear but had been made to talk to its own better angels. Above the sentence, somebody had added another line, smaller, in a different hand: You can look without taking. Helen saw it and let it stand. The town passed under and through, and the sound of tires turned into percussion, and a teenager with a skateboard stopped and said, “Sick,” in a tone that made it sound like good news rather than plague, and Agnes and Sam looked at each other with that secret pride that doesn’t turn itself into a weapon.

Ze stood to the side and let his body be unneeded. He watched Nora praise without condescension, watched Julian keep riding the brakes on his own desire to improve, watched Helen sneak small lessons into the edges of conversation without turning them into school. He thought of his mother’s hands with cumin and lemon, how flavor makes the word home behave in your mouth, and he allowed himself the greedy happiness of having three parts of his life unashamed in the same light. When his radio murmured, it sounded like a neighbor telling him there were pies cooling and could he come get one when he had a second.

By late afternoon, the paint had set. The shark still looked like a shark because the town did not need to lie to itself; it had simply been asked to lose its appetite as spectacle. The sentence held. It held in that stubborn way good words do when the weather tries to talk them out of themselves, and the kids began to drift away in the direction of the river, drawn by the old promise of water and the simple truth that steam on concrete smells like invulnerability. Nora looped her arm through his not like a claim but like a friendly agreement to move in the same direction for a while, and they walked toward Gus’s because you finish things with sugar when sugar is deserved.

Etta leaned out of the pass-through and called them sinners, then handed them cinnamon in paper bags like absolution. “Put that on your list of verbs,” she said to Ze, “the kind that keeps a town friendly. We painted. We ate. We didn’t break.”

He took the bag, and he took the sentence, and he took Nora’s small, sensible contact at his elbow, and he took the way Agnes and Sam had learned something without anyone having to say the word lesson. He saved the sound of the roller on concrete, soft and certain, and put it somewhere he would be able to find it when the station smelled like hot paper again and the radio tried to convince him the world had only emergencies. He wrote nothing down in the moment. He let the day write itself onto him with the light that remained, and he allowed himself the thought that maybe the residency had been good for something more than a line on a form. It had made him greedy for towns that could hold both law and mercy without asking him to place them in separate drawers. He decided to go by the river before anything else and listen to the water practice being the same and different, and maybe, if the gulls permitted, he would tell it a quiet story about a ladder that conceded, a sentence that stood up straight, and a boy who wants yellow.
