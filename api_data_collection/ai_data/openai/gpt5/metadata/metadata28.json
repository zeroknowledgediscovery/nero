     "novel_text": "The first time Ilyria saw the seawall, a procession of armored dead were climbing it in perfect silence. Their boots clinked like glass tapping a rim, a tiny toast repeated and repeated until it became a rhythm. The air smelled of salt and engine grease and the rain that did not fall, suspended like a rumor at the edge of the clouds. The wall itself was poured concrete and old poems, recent paint scrolled over chipped slogans, the names of those who promised never to die and then kept the promise, in their way. A gull spiraled close enough to be a handkerchief and then flicked away, as if embarrassed by the attention. On the far side, the sea made a careful, grinding sound, like something sharpening its teeth on the horizon.\n\nShe carried her wings as a coat. That was the trick the old choristers had taught her: not to hide, but to insinuate. The feathers obeyed the fiction\u2014a long, dull grey coat that draped to her calves and swayed of its own weather. It did not fit, and that made it fit. Everyone in Glass Harbor wore something that didn\u2019t quite belong to them.\n\n\u201cBright,\u201d said a voice, and a man with a stitched cheek and eyes the color of pressurized ice stopped beside her. He had a metal pin on his collar, a simple circle with a single stroke through it: Wardens Corps. The pin was polished to an unreasonable shine, as if the hand that polished it had made a vow. He didn\u2019t smell like rot, but like iron filings and sage tea. The dead here were well-kept. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to climb, don\u2019t. We\u2019ve enough falling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Ilyria said. The lie fluttered out; it had a sound like a moth. \u201cI was listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe\u2014\u201d She hesitated. From the top of the wall came a thrum, so low she could hardly hear it. It was under hearing, under her heart. The procession had reached the crest and was standing in a row, rifles slung, their faces turned toward the city as if people-watching. Below them, a kiosk sputtered neon, offering dumplings and fragments of antique music. \u201cThe pattern.\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, lifted his chin toward the Wardens. \u201cThey count their steps. It keeps them together. Same as us. The living don\u2019t make time; time hauls us like a cart. But a count, that\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nShe looked at his hands. Under the ash-and-silver skin, muscle and tendon moved like something rehearsed. He was not what she had expected of a zombie. That word was impolite here, like a slur. They were Wardens; they were the fallen who signed their names a second time, who agreed to stand up again when the bell was rung. It wasn\u2019t necromancy. It was civic duty. Don\u2019t poke it too hard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Orrin,\u201d he said. He let the name out with no ceremony, like spilling water just to see how it would fall.\n\n\u201cIlyria.\u201d\n\nHe nodded once. No commentary. That was another thing about the dead: they saved their breath for orders. \u201cIf you\u2019re listening for patterns, come on. I\u2019ve got a friend who tunes the city. She hears everything, even what isn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nThey walked along the lower road, past stalls and stacks of crate-wood platforms and a boy with a kite made of aluminum foil who laughed like a leak in a pipe. Ilyria kept her hands in her coat pockets, so the feathers would remember to be still. The city\u2019s noises were a slow braided rope: bicycle bells, accordion wheeze, the click of relays switching somewhere a block away, someone clapping out a code at a window with the curtains drawn. Above all, the wind. The wind here had been made to work. It turned vanes and dragged flags and shook chimes and lifted the failed promises out of people\u2019s mouths so they could breathe again.\n\nOrrin turned into an alley with coppery murals rising out of the brick. They had been drawn by someone with a long brush and a high perch\u2014a ladder?\u2014and maybe the help of two or three accomplices who didn\u2019t mind paint on their shoes. The alley smelled like tangerines and welding. Halfway down, a paper lantern hung on a chain. It had been repaired with tape at least six times. The chain was thick enough to secure a submarine.\n\n\u201cLeta,\u201d Orrin called. He didn\u2019t say it loud. Saying anything loud in Glass Harbor was a way to invite arguments.\n\nA girl stuck her head out of a door with a noise like a trap easing off its tooth. She had short hair that had been dyed the color of a faded traffic cone and then grown out to reveal its natural black underneath. Headphones lounged around her neck like a cat that believed itself a scarf. \u201cWar-lord,\u201d she said. \u201cYou bring me a war?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust brightness.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Leta,\u201d Orrin said. \u201cShe broadcasts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIllicitly,\u201d Leta said politely. \u201cBecause legal would be dull.\u201d\n\nShe looked at Ilyria with interest and caution and a cleverness that pulled the corners of her mouth up when she wasn\u2019t thinking about it. Her eyes flicked down, found the wrongness of the coat, flicked up again and pretended to find nothing at all. \u201cWell, Bright. Come in, if you like rules. My rules, which are sturdier than the city\u2019s but have fewer officials.\u201d\n\nThe studio had been a storeroom once, and still remembered. Crates, boxes, catalog cards in a metal tray that shone with fingerprints. Between all that, the shrine of an industrious god: an old mixer with solder scars, a pair of ribbon mics like twin steel dragonflies, a squat transmitter, a rack of spools. The spools were labeled with handwriting, the kind that had begun as neat but then had grown anxious and took to blaming the pen.\n\n\u201cSit,\u201d Leta said, and scooped a cat off the only padded chair. The cat made a noise that suggested it had expected better. \u201cTea? I\u2019ve got a bag of something that smells like the inside of a library.\u201d\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d Ilyria said, because etiquette matters. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nOrrin leaned against a shelf and did his best impression of an idle person. It wasn\u2019t bad. His idle was anyone else\u2019s alert. The healed seam on his cheek pulled slightly. She thought of thread and of water that had learned to be patient.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Leta said, between clinks and the soft ripping hurry of boiling water. \u201cYou\u2019re far from your cloud.\u201d\n\nIlyria smiled with her mouth and not her eyes. \u201cThe clouds are often farther than they look.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had rumors about your sort. Tall. Shiny. Throat full of thunder. Leans over balconies and points at things. The usual. But you don\u2019t look like a rumor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like one,\u201d Ilyria said. She could feel the other thing, though. The hum behind her ribs, the melody that had written its hook across the inside of her skull and then left the rest of the song off the page. It was pop, the way a heartbeat is pop: simple, ruthless, relentless, honest. The Choir had hated this kind of thing. They had said it was too easy, too obvious. They had said it stole attention. They had said more things. They had stopped saying anything, one day, all together, like a door shutting thirteen doorways away.\n\nLeta settled the cups on a tray and pushed the tray through the knotted wires like it was a negotiation. \u201cThere\u2019s a new station,\u201d she said, as if that were small talk. \u201cShowed up three weeks ago. You know the way a song you don\u2019t even like will lodge in your teeth? This isn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s not even a song. It\u2019s like the suggestion of a song. The negative-space of a chorus. It\u2019s eating bands, Ilyria. I find gaps where there were tracks. People get quiet, after they hear it. Sometimes they forget what they were saying in the middle of a sentence and they never remember.\u201d\n\nOrrin rapped his knuckle lightly against the shelf. \u201cWe had three Wardens wander out of their perimeter, last night. When I touched them, their hands were like a refrigerator tray you forgot to defrost. And they were smiling. Not a real smile. The kind kids draw when they\u2019re trying to make a ghost less scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Concord calls it a dampening wave,\u201d Leta said. \u201cBecause the Concord likes to pretend we live in a world of mechanics, not magic. But with respect to the Concord, whatever it is, it tastes like a borrowed grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has a rhythm,\u201d Ilyria heard herself say, softly. The cups were warm in her hands. Heat, such an ordinary miracle. \u201cI can hear the math of it. Like footfalls.\u201d\n\nOrrin\u2019s eyes did whatever eyes do when their owner has already half-decided to hope. \u201cCan you hum it?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t, because something in her knew that to hum was to consent, to feed and be fed-upon. She had been told stories about the old wars, where melodies had been used as weapons, and not metaphorically, not at all. The way a sung pitch could lay a bridge of fire across a spine. The way a wrong harmony could make a heart forget its order.\n\n\u201cI could transform it,\u201d she said instead. It tasted like a lie, but it wasn\u2019t. Not exactly. \u201cBut I would need\u2026 it\u2019s not a studio matter.\u201d She gestured to the slab of recorder, the coiled cords. \u201cIt\u2019s my head. That\u2019s the stage.\u201d\n\nLeta looked at her for a long beat. \u201cDon\u2019t flirt. It wastes good tragedy. You mean you can broadcast without kit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean I can compose a message that will use me as its speaker. I can let it happen. And if I do, it will land where it needs to.\u201d\n\nOrrin\u2019s jaw tightened. His knuckles were still against the wood. \u201cAnd where is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the bones,\u201d Ilyria said. The cat, as if bored of theology, sprang to the desk and knocked a pencil to the floor. The pencil made a decision about whether to break and chose no. \u201cWhich is why I cannot do it casually. It\u2019s not a poem. It\u2019s more like weather.\u201d\n\nThe word hung in the room. Weather. The difference between a drizzle and a storm is not simply how wet you get. It is which memories of ships you carry afterward.\n\nLeta took a breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to test. Carefully. Tiny. Like microdose. I can give you a line. The backline. Nobody listens to the backline but the kind of nerds who read whitepapers for fun. No offense, Orrin.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone taken,\u201d he said. \u201cAll my papers were black on the front.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d also introduce you to the Council,\u201d Leta said to Ilyria. \u201cThey\u2019re prickly and petty and terrified. They\u2019ll want to cut you into committees, if you let them. But they pay in batteries and safe corridors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why would you do that?\u201d Ilyria asked her. \u201cIntroduce me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the city needs its chimera.\u201d Leta shrugged. \u201cBecause when the world refuses to make sense, I prefer to run at the most interesting nonsense with a slightly illegal antenna. Because you look like you\u2019ve been listening for longer than we\u2019ve been alive, and I\u2019m vain enough to think I could learn to listen like that.\u201d\n\nIlyria smiled, real this time. It surprised her mouth. She thought of the Choir and of their marble logic, their bloodless brilliance. She thought of how they had loved rules the way engineers love riverbanks\u2014not to stop the river, but to point it where it could sing. She thought of the silence that had fallen over all of them like a net. The day her messages received no replies, she had stood on a hill and sang their names until the birds came and sat on the wires to look at her. The birds had been very polite.\n\n\u201cShow me your backline,\u201d she said.\n\nLeta touched the transmitter with a gentle, proprietary hand. \u201cI\u2019ll show you mine if you show me yours. The mind, I mean. Your\u2014\u201d She flapped her fingers awkwardly near her temple. \u201cYour\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarmony,\u201d Ilyria supplied. \u201cIt\u2019s a little broken. But yes.\u201d\n\nThey spent that afternoon making a room smaller and bigger at once. Leta tuned and tuned again, narrowing channels, braiding them. She threaded cable above her head like wires between planets, connecting the imaginary constellations with real copper. Orrin came and went, as Wardens do, giving a report to a lieutenant with eyes like storm glass and returning with an extra coil of rope he insisted the studio would someday need. He carried things like he did not want to wake them.\n\nAt dusk, when the sky was a bruise with a gold thumbprint pressed in, they tried.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Leta said, and breath fogged her headphones. \u201cWe\u2019ll ride on channel twelve. Old city maps. I\u2019ve got the band filter smothered like I smothered my feelings at my cousin\u2019s wedding. You\u2019ll just\u2014think, or sing, or whatever. Keep it under two seconds. You hear me? Two. Seconds. Not two and a half. I put this sticker here to help.\u201d She slapped a sticker on the desk that said Two is a gas station hot dog. Believe in yourself.\n\nIlyria shut her eyes. Closing them did not make her more or less celestial; it only gave the world the courtesy of not looking at it while she did this.\n\nBehind her breastbone, the hum stirred. It had teeth. She had known that. She had known it since the day she woke to the quiet of the Choir and the whole sky had become only hers.\n\nShe opened her mouth and did not move her mouth. The sound rose in her head like breath on a cold morning meets a pane of glass. It had the shape of a chorus but none of the words, the way you can tell a stranger is telling a joke even if you do not speak their language. It was bright. She kept it dull. She held it down with a net of intention, with the thought of how the dark in the corners of the studio felt not scary but restful, with the weight of a cat on a keyboard, with the voice of Leta saying, two seconds, two\u2014\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Leta hissed, and jabbed a button.\n\nIlyria let the brightness out and counted one, two. Stopped.\n\nThe sound had gone nowhere, everywhere. It was not sound, exactly. It was the suggestion of a place to put a sound. It was a hook without a fish. It was a chorus without a verse to wear it. Leta\u2019s eyes were wide; Orrin had one hand on the doorframe without remembering he had put it there.\n\nFor a moment, the city seemed to take a breath.\n\nThen the radio on the shelf\u2014an old portable with a cracked dial and a strip of copper tape holding its battery door shut\u2014hissed and slid and then keened very softly. The keen rose and fell. It matched Ilyria\u2019s last thought.\n\n\u201cIs that good?\u201d Orrin asked, as if he were asking a doctor if his arm was supposed to look like it had been drawn by a child.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Leta said. \u201cOr maybe we just rang a bell nobody told us about. Keep it off. No more. You hear me?\u201d She was looking at Ilyria. \u201cWe don\u2019t press a big red button twice in the same day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t press anything,\u201d Ilyria said. She had to lick her lips to get the words to stop sticking. \u201cThe button pressed me.\u201d\n\nOrrin leaned out the door. \u201cYou two should hear something.\u201d His voice had that careful blankness he used when he was uncertain how much human to be. They followed him into the alley.\n\nThe evening market had a dozen songs at once, as always: litigators arguing about fish prices that had once been prices and were now curses, an aunt scolding her niece for loving someone appropriately, a saxophone complaining into a hat. Underneath that, under even the electric tone the wind-chimes made, there was a sub-music. A new figure in the braid.\n\nPeople were standing a little straighter. Not like soldiers. Like dancers, when the bass checks in and they know someone knows what they came here to do.\n\nOn the seawall, the Wardens lifted their heads, all together, as if smelling bread.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Leta whispered, and touched, without meaning to, the back of Ilyria\u2019s arm. It startled the feathers beneath the coat. \u201cWeather.\u201d\n\nThe test had a price. Isn\u2019t it always sometimes usually. Orrin came back late from his watch with a squared mouth, and there were four Wardens behind him, three upright and one in a chair made from aluminum tubing and bicycle tires. The one in the chair was moving his hands across the arms as if playing an invisible piano. His eyes were closed, and his lips moved. No sound came out.\n\n\u201cWhat did we do?\u201d Leta demanded, low and terrifying.\n\n\u201cIt was already happening,\u201d Orrin said. He kept his temper under ten layers of uniform. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make the fire. We just showed the smoke how to rise.\u201d He looked at Ilyria, then away. \u201cBut you nudged it.\u201d\n\nIlyria crouched in front of the Warden in the chair. He was young. Nineteen? He had died nineteen and chosen to remain nineteen until he\u2019d had enough of duty to deserve a number that meant something else. Someone had sewed a patch on his sleeve with quick, untidy stitches. It said MARROWDALE. He didn\u2019t have a name on his breast. New.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said, as if she were a friend and they had lost each other in a store and now the bread aisle was the place to be found. \u201cHey, can you hear me?\u201d She placed her hand lightly over his fingers where they played. The touch unspooled something in her. She heard, for the first time, the dampening wave not as absence but as a shape. It was the negative of a melody that had once been obvious and now had to be guessed at.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shadow,\u201d she said, out loud. \u201cIt\u2019s singing the places songs aren\u2019t. It\u2019s using the places we aren\u2019t looking.\u201d\n\nLeta swore softly. \u201cWe need more than a backline.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to go up,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cThe choir loft.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe highest place that is not a peak. The place where the wind and the city find each other. You\u2019ll have one. All cities do. They access the hinge. I\u2014\u201d She swallowed. She did not do that often. \u201cThe signal\u2026 layer. It\u2019s not just radio. It\u2019s bones, Orrin. Don\u2019t make that face. It\u2019s not witchcraft. It\u2019s the physics of memory. A couple cathedrals figured it out and pretended they hadn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLeta shoved a hand through her hair and it came away holding dust and a paperclip, which she threw like a small spear at a poster of a festival that had never happened. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Drumhouse. Old amphitheater they turned into a court, then a dormitory, then a prison, then a skate park, then they forgot what it was and stopped asking. The wind goes there to eavesdrop. You think you can\u2014what was the word you used? Transform?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I can put a hook in where the shadow tries to hide,\u201d Ilyria said, and the boy in the chair moved his mouth around the shapes of a syllable. \u201cI can bait it with joy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds illegal,\u201d Leta said, reverent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take you,\u201d Orrin said. \u201cTonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight?\u201d Leta flinched, but not hard. She was brave enough to be afraid.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d Orrin said again. \u201cIf it\u2019s a war, we don\u2019t let morning set the terms. Besides, the Council meets on Tuesdays. We don\u2019t need six secretaries editing our hopes.\u201d\n\nThey went.\n\nGlass Harbor at night was not a darker version of itself. It was a different animal. The markets folded their legs and closed their eyes, and in the spaces they left, other things wandered out: the wheel-men with their bright torches and hard shoes on soft gravel, the children who raced along painted lines on the pavement like prayers written across a map, the Wardens recommissioned as lullaby-makers who walked the quiet streets in pairs, practicing reassuring silence. On the rooftops, pipes hummed and mammoth fans rotated and offered the sky rose-colored measurements. The seawall did its impression of a dinosaur\u2019s back.\n\nDrumhouse sat on the hill like a bowl someone had made out of the idea of sound. Concrete curves lipped, tier upon tier upon tier, all the way down to a stage with its teeth knocked out by climate or decision-making. Someone had painted the steps with equations; someone had come along later and painted the equations into fish. A fence circled the top to keep logic from falling out.\n\nThey climbed. Prenatal wind tangled itself in Ilyria\u2019s hair and made promises. Orrin counted his steps; Leta swore at the tenth step and skipped the eleventh; Ilyria made no noise at all. On the third tier, a man slept with a coat over his face and a dog at his feet that dreamed irregularly. On the fifth, a couple argued softly into each other\u2019s hands, stopping occasionally to laugh, which should be required by law in arguments.\n\nOn the lip of the bowl, everything else was smaller. The harbor, the cranes stacking cargo into a skyline of brief apartments for things, the austere geometry of the main road where trams blinked their eyes like patient fish. And above, stars that wore the exactness of a lie.\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Leta asked, hugging her cables. She had brought cables up a hill because that is what love looks like when it\u2019s practical.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth?\u201d Orrin said, and smiled carefully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how angels pray.\u201d\n\nShe stepped to the place the wind went when it felt like telling secrets. The concrete had been eroded just enough. She put her hand against the air. She could feel the old songs here, the ones the city had hummed itself when it still believed in kings, the ones it had rapped into its own stones when money was a god who needed rhythm, the ones children had shrieked and the ones women had cried into the hems of their dresses and the ones a man missing three fingers had tapped into the railings at dawn just so he\u2019d have something to fight with later.\n\nShe closed her eyes.\n\nThe pop song was not an embarrassment. It was invention. The heart, faced with too much complexity, builds a safety stair out of repeated gestures. It learns to climb. The hook in her mind hooked her, sure, but it also offered her a way to pull back. It was not an enemy. It was a tool that didn\u2019t know it was a tool. It was like she had found a bird and learned it knew only one tune but would sing it both for fun and for safety. She had disliked pop because the Choir had disliked pop. The Choir had been wrong about other things. It turned out you could be divine and petty. Who knew.\n\n\u201cLeta,\u201d she said. \u201cOne second. Not two. If you close me too soon, it will echo. If you leave me too long, it will fist.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it what?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust listen, all right?\u201d\n\nShe breathed. There were seventeen different breezes composing themselves into a consensus around her. She let each of them rattle a different feather under the fiction of the coat. Her bones lengthened. That always happened when she destabilized her voice. She counted in an ancient meter that did not require numbers.\n\nIlyria let the chorus find her. It moved toward the dampening wave the way a magnet moves toward iron it has never met but was promised at birth. She dressed it bright. She gave it words\u2014it had no words, it needed words\u2014and the words were nothing at all and everything, the kind of words a child could remember and a soldier could believe and a dead man could call to mind when he was due to pick up his helmet. The words were these:\n\n\u201cUp and up, my heart, up and up.\u201d\n\nShe did not know, until she sang them, that they would be what she said. They were simple enough to be a lie and true enough to be a spell. She let them ring and held and stopped.\n\nGlass Harbor breathed again. The bowl took the sound she had not made and set it down in every ear as if it were a coin.\n\nOn the far side of the hill, sirens started their wolves and then stopped not because they had been told to stop but because they remembered other work. Two Wardens below them turned toward each other and tapped their knuckles together in a motion that was part greeting and part recording, and the young one of the two had his stitches pulled too tight and said, \u201cUp?\u201d\n\n\u201cUp,\u201d the older one said, trying the syllable on, as if it had to do with windows.\n\nLeta had tears in her eyes. She was not the sort of person songs organized. She organized songs; it was one of her many arrogances. But this had gone under her hands, under the desk she loved, under the thick coil of cable she slept with sometimes when the city barked too loud. \u201cYou made it. You made it pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made it loud,\u201d Ilyria said. She was shaky now. She would shake worse later. \u201cI made it like candy but for the part of a brain that learned to leave a room when the room grew smaller.\u201d\n\nOrrin\u2019s mouth had opened, about to say some generous thing. Before he did, the wind came back wrong, and the wrong was cold.\n\nIn the very low place, the place beneath the sea and under the beds of children and behind the curtain of ordinary fear, the dampening wave pushed. It pressed back, not because it disliked what she had done, but because pushing is what it was. Pressure made to be pressure. The shadow turned on itself, eddied, gathered. And somewhere below, in the city, a radio that had never worked hummed a note that made a flock of pigeons lift at once, startle, settle.\n\nOrrin\u2019s hand touched her arm. Just fingers. Hard to tell where the glove ended. \u201cIs it going to break?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything breaks,\u201d Ilyria said. She felt the scattered strengths of her scattered bones. \u201cBut we can decide when to glue it.\u201d\n\nThey left the bowl and its hopeful echo and walked down with care. The wind followed as far as it dared. At the foot of the hill, a boy was waiting in a hoodie three sizes too big for him and shoes that had been someone else\u2019s with a different kind of foot. He had a backpack that squirmed as if it had caught a cricket.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he said. He was eleven. The city made eleven-year-olds like factories made whistles. He had a voice that had learned not to say the wrong names. \u201cCouncil wants you. The Bright. Both of you. They said the dead are murmuring and we did not authorize murmurs.\u201d\n\nOrrin almost laughed. It was very small and it did not leave his throat. \u201cThey never do.\u201d\n\nLeta dropped a coil of cable into the backpack without asking if that was an acceptable thing to do. The backpack made a forgiving sound. \u201cPax? Is that you? Who let you carry messages at night?\u201d\n\n\u201cI let me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, they send a man with shoes that squeak and then everyone knows a message is coming and they hide in their stoves. Also my aunt said it was okay as long as I wasn\u2019t on the big roads and I listened to my intuition. My intuition says you smell like static.\u201d\n\n\u201cWise intuition,\u201d Ilyria said gently. \u201cWe\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\nThe Council of Breath met in a building shaped like a compromise. It had been declared both round and square by committee, and in settling the question, it had become a top hat someone melted and then sat on to see if it would fit. Inside were desks and flags and a very old plant that had never once given anyone a straight answer. A woman with rings on every finger except the one that announces and a man in a suit made from old suit collars and a third person who had a face like a new book you were afraid to crack gave them the kind of smiles people hand out when they are both grateful and irritated.\n\n\u201cWe heard your noise,\u201d the ringed woman said, without introduction.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a noise,\u201d Leta said. \u201cIt was a snack. For a void.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate snacks,\u201d the man in collar-suit said. He had the precise tone of a person who had come to appreciate a great many things in order to keep his job. \u201cBut we also like to know who fed whom. And with what. And whether anyone is going to get indigestion.\u201d\n\nOrrin stood still in the corner, and his stillness softened their voices the way a stack of quilts in a room makes people hush because they don\u2019t want to wake the dust.\n\n\u201cThe dampening wave is not random,\u201d Ilyria said. She was not supposed to reach conclusions yet. But the way parts of her were shaking made it easier to speak than to let silence become a second decision. \u201cIt\u2019s a feedback. And it\u2019s organized. It\u2019s being shepherded by someone who understands how bodies listen.\u201d\n\nThe Council members looked at one another. The new-book one said, \u201cAre you implying a mind. A mind that would do such a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stating it,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cNot implying. I\u2019m implying other things I don\u2019t want to say yet.\u201d She glanced at Orrin. He understood more than he made a habit of admitting. \u201cYour Wardens are the most vulnerable. Their bones are tuned. The living forget certain pains, naturally, over time. The dead\u2026 some of you chose to be very exact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d Orrin said, like a man who once volunteered and keeps volunteering. \u201cWe are.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think this shadow\u2014this wave\u2014wants to take our soldiers,\u201d the ringed woman said. \u201cFor what purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo unman a city,\u201d the man said softly, as if quoting his childhood.\n\n\u201cTo turn an army,\u201d the new-book one said. \u201cBecause an army that cannot feel its own signal will take a new one. Any one. The loudest. The simplest.\u201d\n\nLeta looked at Ilyria. The angle of her chin was terrible and beautiful. It said, I will hold you to your own suggestion. \u201cThen we make ours loud,\u201d she said. \u201cWe make it so catchy the bones sing it when they\u2019re busy growing. We make it the thing the shadow can\u2019t be, because it has no words, and because it uses subtraction instead of addition. We use stupid joy and we use it like scaffolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d Ilyria said. Her mouth was dry now. The tea had been after all insufficient. \u201cI can\u2019t just sing through equipment. If I do that, the wave will swallow it like a river swallows a bridge built of the wrong metal. The metal I have is\u2026 this.\u201d She gestured to herself. Coil and cloak and all the old light the world had left her. \u201cI have no choice, when the time comes. I may have no breath afterwards. You asked to be briefed? That is the brief.\u201d\n\nThe Council considered the cost without touching it. No one cried. No one asked her not to. In the petty universe of committees, that counted as courage.\n\n\u201cWe will resource you,\u201d the ringed woman said briskly. \u201cWe will make corridors. We will put the word in every window that listens. You\u2019ll work with Communications Sub-committee and the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWith me,\u201d Leta said. \u201cShe\u2019ll work with me.\u201d She jutted her chin at the three. \u201cYou don\u2019t know timing. You know minutes. We need seconds. Two, to be exact.\u201d\n\nOrrin, who had not told them all the ways his dead had gone quiet, who had not confessed how the young one in the chair had smiled without a person behind it for a moment that lasted three long buses and a breath, said, \u201cAnd with me. We\u2019ll need to hold the perimeters. We\u2019ll need to hold each other. We can not have everything. But we can have that.\u201d\n\nAfterward, outside, the night had grown teeth but decided not to use them in front of guests. Pax, the boy messenger, put his hand on Ilyria\u2019s coat and said, \u201cYour coat is alive,\u201d and grinned like a moon trying out a scar.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it forgets to be.\u201d She bent down and, because she could and because someone should, gave him the truth in a spoon. \u201cI will make a song. It will be very silly and very earnest. It will have words even you won\u2019t be able to get out of your head, and you will hate me in the way we hate anything that returns as soon as we stop holding it back. It will pass through your bones. It will fix some things and break some. You will keep it for the rest of your life, which I hope will be long. And someday you will give it away. That\u2019s the only way to keep it.\u201d\n\nPax considered this with the severity of a child comparing two deserts. \u201cEverybody thinks the dead are the soldiers,\u201d he said finally. \u201cBut the living carry all the heavy. Because we keep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ilyria said. She did. She had always known. She had wished not to.\n\nWhen they parted, Orrin walked beside her as flat roads turned to stairs again. He didn\u2019t ask her what her feathers were called. He didn\u2019t ask her where the light went at dawn. He asked her, kindly, \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and did not mean to laugh when she said it, and laughed anyway. \u201cThe pop part is painless. The mind part is catastrophic. But not all at once. Don\u2019t look like that. If I need to, I\u2019ll teach you the part that holds me together until I can fall apart where it will frighten the fewest children. That\u2019s fieldcraft too.\u201d\n\nHe made a small shrug she could have hung a coat on. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a plan that includes children. We always do.\u201d\n\nBack in the alley, the lantern with six tapes around its belly caught a dying fly and sang to it, softly. Leta was already inside, making lists on the backs of lists. She did not ask whether Ilyria was coming back tomorrow; she wrote it down as if the future had already been obedient.\n\nOn the shelf, the old radio warbled without making an enemy of quiet. It was learning the word up. It was not a word. It was a direction.\n\nIlyria lay on the thin couch with the blanket that smelled of the studio and the cat and the kind of shampoo used by people who build transmitters by hand. Her body remembered shaking. It would take a while to stop. The hook in her mind was a polite guest tonight; it had eaten recently; it would wait. She closed her eyes and tried not to count. Counting can be a spell. Counting can attract things that like numbers.\n\nIn the hyper-clear place between waking and the other waking, she saw the Choir. Not as they had been, with their satin of bright logic, but as ghosts in a window when you look for something else. She saw their hands and their mouths, opening, closing. The silence that had swallowed them spoke, after all. It had always been speaking. It was saying, in its slow terrible grammar: You will give up everything you are to save someone else\u2019s favorite song. Do you consent.\n\nHer heart said yes by climbing.\n\nThe city slept. Someone in a hotel made from three specific dreams rolled over and found their foot had found a foot that trusted it. A Warden on the seawall adjusted his collar and hummed under his repaired breath. A boy called Pax put a hand under his pillow and touched the coil of wire he had rescued from a gutter in case it had a memory in it that he could use. The wind licked the words off the top of the amphitheater and carried them down into the drains where secrets like to be washed before anyone hears them. Up and up, my heart, up and up.\n\nIn the morning, they would map the places that had changed. In the morning, they would argue about batteries. In the morning, Ilyria would drink tea and take a breath and sit in a chair and make her mind a stage.\n\nTonight, she made a very small promise to herself, the size of a pin or a seed under anyone else\u2019s tongue. It sounded like a vow and like a hook and like a door opening in a song that should not have any doors.\n\nShe promised to learn the entire world\u2019s chorus before she sang it back. Or at least enough of it that when she let the big, silly, noisy, earnest, insistent song happen, it would know who it was speaking to.\n\nHer wings turned in her sleep and knocked gently against the side of the couch, like a neighbor who has lived there long enough not to mind the late hours. The lantern swayed, reconsidered, stayed.\n\nLong after, when the backline murmured to itself and even the wind had finished for the day, the old radio said, very softly, to the empty room. \u201cUp.\u201d Then it said, equally softly, as if taste-testing its own talent for language: \u201cTogether.\u201d And the silence did not eat that. Not yet. Not tonight.Morning in Glass Harbor did not arrive so much as remember itself. The percussive noises changed instruments, the vendors tightened their jokes, the sea exhaled color that had been kept under a tarp all night, and along the seawall the Wardens did not so much wake as rotate duties between shells. Ilyria rose with the awkwardness of someone who had slept next to a machine and dreamt in wires, her bones a little out of order, her feathers pretending to be cloth so conscientiously that one or two of them had staged a protest against it. The cat chose to forgive her for taking the couch by sitting on her toes, and the old radio made a sound like it was chewing sugar and did not want to be caught.\n\nLeta had left a list on the desk that carried the weight of a treaty. The list had the sort of handwriting that meant business and the sort of jokes in the margins that meant mercy. Orrin arrived between the second and third cup of tea with the same unflustered punctuality as bad weather, and Ilyria watched the way his presence smoothed the room the way a palm smooths a wrinkled letter. He said nothing about the night beyond a nod to the old radio and a look he loaned her that meant we will count together.\n\nThey went out into a city that had tucked the word up into its belt. On a tram someone had chalked the hook on the floor between the doors where people stand with their bags and their regrets, and as the tram braked, three strangers hummed the syllable like they had agreed on it without knowing one another\u2019s faces. A fishmonger with hands like bruised marble whistled a rising fragment as he packed shaved ice into a crate, and when his knife slipped he jerked back and laughed as if he had been caught trying to steal from his own pockets. In a laundry courtyard a line of wet shirts clapped together and made a thin rising rhythm that would have gone unnoticed yesterday.\n\nLeta did not so much take notes as persuade them. She walked and listened and let the city tell on itself, and Ilyria could tell when she heard something truly interesting because her shoulders found a new posture and stayed there like they had discovered better furniture. Pax turned up with a roll of paper taller than he was and a fistful of rubber bands he wore like bracelets, and he set himself to taping the new map segments down with the gravity of a boy allowed to hold sharp scissors. He had drawn circles around the places where the backline had found listeners, and triangles where the dampening kept winning, and he added a small star where he said nothing made any sense and it made him itchy to stand there.\n\nMarrowdale was itchy. It had not been a neighborhood so much as a habit, and habits, when interrupted, sulk. The streets there were too straight and then suddenly too curved, the buildings too proud of their bricks, the plaza too convinced that a fountain could fix anything that a fountain could not fix. Orrin\u2019s dead knew these corners the way a hand knows a pocket, and the ones on duty now wore the deliberate alertness of people who intend to be serious in front of their younger siblings. They had not smiled for practice, and so the residue of last night\u2019s fixed smile had not stuck to them, which was a relief, and Ilyria found the young Warden from the chair near the statue of a woman pouring water eternally into nothing.\n\nHe was on his feet. Someone had given him a cane that had been made for someone shorter, which made him a little jaunty against his will, and he had the exhausted pride of a person who has not failed yet today. When he saw Orrin he straightened, which for a moment made him look not nineteen but precisely the age that obedience makes you. He did not remember the chair or the piano that had not been there, but he remembered the word, and he said it softly like he was checking a compass. Up, he said, and his knuckles tapped pattern against his thigh that was not a march but a measure, and Orrin answered him in the same rhythm as if shaking hands without touching.\n\nThe dampening hid in seams. Leta traced her finger along a line of rivets and said that when the negative-song comes, it creeps where maintenance forgot to go. It likes cable trays and stairwells, she told them, and it has a taste for freight elevators and for the hollow parts under stages. She showed Ilyria a set of squiggles on the map that anyone else would have called a mistake and told her no, this is where someone decided the blueprint should not be public, and Ilyria felt the way the wave nested there like a bird who had decided to occupy a mouth.\n\nBy noon they had a pattern with holes in it. The holes were either where the wind was strong enough to refuse to host an intruder, or where the intruder had dug in so well that surface listening only traced its memory. Orrin made quiet calls with his pin pressed to his sleeve in a way that meant it could carry voice if he fed it careful breath, and the Wardens at the other end of those murmurs returned bearings like men delivering eggs in a storm. Pax ran messages with an efficiency that suggested he had conquered the geometry of alleys and was not impressed by maps that pretended his routes did not exist. The Council\u2019s courier arrived twice and left twice and on the second visit confessed shyly to Leta that he had been hearing the word in his sleep and his wife had not yelled at him about it, which he suspected might be love.\n\nCommunications Sub-committee attempted to recruit them during a break where a break was not available. They arrived in a clump that made the street slimmer, carrying clipboards as if they were shields, and the chairwoman, who wore her hair in a bun so tight that it seemed to have learned its own discipline, thanked Ilyria for her civic-mindedness in terms so flawless they might have been ironed. She had developed, overnight, a list of approved phrases and a schedule that could be used for dissemination, and she had designed a poster in which the word UP crushed the word SHADOW beneath it with the help of three lightning bolts and a cartoon Warden with improbably straight teeth.\n\nLeta was polite in the way a cat is polite to a vacuum cleaner. She took the schedule and folded it until it could fit inside a pocket that did not exist and promised to obey it whenever physics allowed. Ilyria answered a question about the frequency band with a description of a river that chooses its own banks and watched the chairwoman\u2019s attention move away and return like a kite in shifting wind. Orrin said nothing at all and stood directly behind Ilyria, which made the committee\u2019s expressions settle into a compromise between flattered and wary, and in the end the chairwoman shook Leta\u2019s hand and said something bland that almost, if you twisted it, counted as permission.\n\nThe radio learned. It repeated up with slightly different accents, as if testing which vowels made the bone most willing to rock, and when Ilyria set her palm on its plastic casing, the hum unrolled like a carpet and showed her the marks the dampening had left behind. She pressed with the same caution she would use on a stranger\u2019s soft throat, and in that contact there was a glimpse of a memory that was not hers. The memory was of a dark room where screens had once burned arcs into faces and of pipes that carried sound in the way blood carries oxygen, and of a hand that had a scar across the palm press the wrong button very gently because nothing ought to be rough with a wrong button. She did not tell the others what she saw, not because she wanted to hoard it, but because words would change it and she was not yet ready to spend that currency.\n\nThe afternoon bent toward wind. Leta drew three triangles on the map and connected them with a line so crooked it insisted upon being right, and she said that if they stood at these points in a stagger and listened, they would hear where the pressure drew tightest. The points were not obvious, which made Ilyria like them more. One was the tram depot with its roof designed to be a listening drum and its floors designed to be scrubbed by a generation that would no longer own trams. One was a bell tower that had not rung since the day the clock beneath it decided to tell the truth about time and was summarily reassigned to a job that involved rotating banners. One was Spindle Yard, a wedge of rooftops where small urban turbines worked themselves into minor frenzies for the city grid and then cooled like dogs with their tongues out.\n\nThey divided the work. Orrin took the bell tower, because stairs, and because his kind were good at being obvious in a way that made others behave. Leta took the depot because she wanted to listen to the rails and because she liked the acoustics under the long tin roof, and she bribed the depot master with a bag of hard candies and a promise to fix his personal radio if she lived. Ilyria took Spindle Yard, because the wind there had a history of making up its mind, and because she could talk to the turbines without a translator. Pax went with her as if he had decided she was in need of an assistant who could fit into places where angels could not go, and on the way up the last flight, he told her about his aunt\u2019s garden and how the vegetables had argued with the rain this year and which one had won.\n\nSpindle Yard smelled like a library of tin roofs. The little turbines spun like polite opinions, and between them someone had strung flags the color of arguments at a wedding and the nets that kept pigeons honest. Ilyria let the coat pretend one more time and shrugged it off, feather by feather, until standing with her wings as they were felt like apologizing and then not apologizing, and Pax watched with the solemn greed of a person who has just discovered he will get to keep a secret he never could have imagined. She raised her hands and touched not the machines but the air above them, and the first thing she felt was gratitude.\n\nThe gratitude was for the hooks she had given away. The wind had caught them and tied them to itself and carried them along like kites without strings, and where the dampening had been heavy, it now found itself bumping into something that had definition. The second thing she felt was irritation from the dampening where it struck those bright places, as if finding furniture in a dark room where once there had been nothing but shadow, and then the irritation turned thin and rippled into something like strategy. Someone was learning from her as quickly as she was learning from them, and if she had not been what she was, the thought would have broken her concentration.\n\nPax had set up three soda cans with pebbles in them like a high-efficiency bad instrument, and he tapped them in a pattern that was, somehow, the way staircases sound when you run up them with hope. The pebbles told him when she got close to a right place because their rattling changed from random to something a little stuck, and when she stepped left and forward, the leftmost can stopped entirely. The boy grinned and then seemed to remember he was trying to be a professional and made his face stern again, but his shoes gave him away by bouncing.\n\nIlyria found the seam. The wave was coming through one turbine like a whisper dragged through a reed, and she felt where someone had filed a tiny notch into the cap and laid a coil underneath that was not in the plans. The coil had been wound tight and then painted so it looked like any other part, and it had a resonance that would have been harmless if not for the wind\u2019s consistency. She did not touch it with her hands. She touched it with the part of her that the Choir had taught to dismantle songs and put them back together, and she put her ear to the difference until she understood its shape, and when she opened her eyes, Pax had moved closer without moving at all.\n\n\u201cYou look like a teacher who is also a knife,\u201d he said, not quite whispering.\n\n\u201cI am only sharp if you push,\u201d she told him, and he believed her as completely as a child believes a well-told lie. She called Leta on a line that was a wire and a ritual and told her what she had found, and Leta swore in three languages that were not hers and said the depot had the same coil under its light fixtures. Orrin arrived on the channel with no ornament and said the bell tower had it in the hollow of the bell, which was almost funny except it was not.\n\nThe coils were not accidents. They had been placed by hands that knew their work would be seen eventually, which meant either arrogance or invitation, and Ilyria did not like either option. Pax asked if he could steal the one in front of them and take it home for his shelf of interesting crimes, and Ilyria said no because theft has a sound and sometimes the sound is bait. She crouched and let the hum press against her forehead like a feverish child, and she sang the smallest possible note she could make, so small that it would not fit inside a microphone, and so pure that it could not carry extra meaning without breaking.\n\nThe coil went quiet for a moment that could not have happened if the map of the city had not been wrong about who owned the wind. The pause was clean. It told her two things at once, which was considerate for a machine. It told her the coils did not create the dampening, they refined it. It told her that somewhere not far and not near, a central breath took the in and the out and decided how hard to press. She stood and let her wings shrug a little, and a shadow in the stairwell that had decided it was a man because it had a hat, detached from its wall and resolved into an actual person who had been waiting for her to finish so he could either change his mind or do what he had come to do.\n\nHe had no pin. His suit was the kind that does not belong to anyone until it belongs to everyone, and his shoes were polite to gravel. When he spoke, his voice had the professional softness of someone who had practiced on ears while the ears belonged to people who could not interrupt, and his smile wanted to be practiced but had not been given enough time to suffer yet. He called her Bright like a man who had been warned about manners. He told Pax that children should not climb and that he himself had never fallen except when it mattered. He addressed Leta on the open line by name and asked her to tell Orrin to holster the weapon he did not carry because the Wardens had been very clear about optics.\n\nLeta said she did not entertain bricks with mouths when she was working. Orrin walked onto the roof from nowhere and made the space that the man could use to move smaller by existing in it with his quiet. Pax crossed his arms and looked at the man in a way that suggested a slingshot might presently invent itself if it discovered the need. Ilyria kept her hands where he could see them and wondered what benches and committees had taught this man to wear his gravity like a tincture instead of a stone.\n\nThe man introduced himself as Aurek. It was a name with letters that were good at carrying weight and at not being from here. He said he represented an organization whose name he did not share, which suggested it was either too proud of itself to speak easily or too ashamed of itself to risk being remembered. He complimented the city\u2019s resilience and excused himself for having to be the sort of person who arrived waving concerns. He informed them gently that the coils were protected property and should not be removed without authorization, and in the way he said it was notarized anxiety and the skin of a shark.\n\n\u201cAuthorization by whom,\u201d Leta asked, which was not a question so much as a fishing line.\n\n\u201cBy the Concord,\u201d Aurek said, and made the word taste like cinnamon so no one noticed the iron filings until it was too late. He held his hands low and away from his jacket the way people do when they have permits. He explained, with the tiny pauses of someone moving on stones that are not fully embedded, that the dampening wave was a pilot program to prevent riot conditions in coastal cities during resource stress, that it had gone into tests in several locations and produced promising results in metrics that he of course did not have on him, and that some variables were misbehaving in Glass Harbor due to unusual acoustic architecture and the presence of high-variance actors.\n\nHe meant them. He meant Ilyria\u2019s bones. He meant Leta\u2019s deviations. He meant the Wardens\u2019 literal skeletons, tuned like instruments, which any sensible empire would have set to a key and kept in a case. Orrin did not move, which was information if you knew him. Leta said the words pilot program very slowly as if she wanted to see whether saying them at a different pace would make them less cruel. Pax put his foot on the nearest turbine and the turbine shuddered as if startled, which seemed to please him.\n\n\u201cYou turn people down like radios,\u201d Ilyria said. She kept her voice a woven thing, not a blade. She wanted him to hear as much as he could before he stopped listening. \u201cYou coat silence on bones and then pretend you have given the city a coat it wanted. You installed coils in the lungs of the wind\u2019s machines and you called it working with the weather. You did not ask. You counted us instead of letting us count.\u201d\n\nAurek blinked. For the first time since he had spoken, his face did not do what faces do when they believe the room is theirs. He spread his fingers as if to show her the lines he had paid to be written into them. He suggested that the Concord had consulted with several representatives of municipal governments who had signed documents using pens with special ink. He regretted that the presence of post-mortal security units made the city unusually susceptible, and he said the phrase post-mortal security units like he was proud of having learned the kind wording. He offered to set up a meeting where concerns could be addressed in an orderly fashion.\n\nLeta said a word that was short and old and patriotic in a way the Concord would not appreciate. Orrin looked at Aurek as if he were reading the instructions on a device that claimed to be safe around water, and then he asked the question he had been born twice to ask. What happens if we turn it off, he said, with the stillness of a person who will catch a falling blade with his teeth if asked, and the man in the suit did not answer immediately.\n\nWhen he did, he said that the wave had been designed to refuse sudden discontinuities in the interest of avoiding shock events. He said sudden discontinuities were correlated with panic, which he had learned in a course about crowd control that had used footage of people with faces, and which he had not watched with the sound on. He said the wave would persist at a basal level for a period of days, then weeks, then possibly forever unless seeded to a new standard. He said forever like it was a shelf life.\n\nThe wind bit the edge of the roof in a way that meant go. Ilyria said that she appreciated the information and would be leaving with it, and Aurek lifted his chin in resigned agreement and asked quietly if she would be willing to come to a demonstration of the wave under controlled conditions in a facility where their safety would be guaranteed. Pax made a noise that sounded like a laugh someone had put in his backpack by accident. Leta leaned forward and plucked a hair from Aurek\u2019s jacket sleeve like it was a mechanical error and she intended to fix it later, and then she gave him a smile that had no teeth in it and meant report back that we are not going to be manageable.\n\nThey left the coil in place because it was better to understand what it spoke than to make it turn to whisper elsewhere. They set little mirrors around the turbine that Ilyria tilted with her fingers to make the wind stumble just enough that the wave carried badly when it tried to ride the air, and Leta adjusted her backline so that anyone listening there would hear a joke about eels that was a code asking Wardens to count aloud at intersections. Orrin walked down the stairs so slowly that Aurek was forced to stand still and wait or break the dignity he thought he wore like a hat, and Pax walked backward so he would not miss anything in case the man decided to sprout an extra face.\n\nBack at the studio, the air tasted like a plan you did not trust yet. Leta unrolled the map and laid it flat and set a dozen batteries on the corners so that suspicion could not curl back up again, and Ilyria drew with a stub of graphite the way the wave had moved when she pressed. She sketched the pause and the tightening and the way the pressure had felt the instant before it retreated, and the picture looked like a drum skin with a thumb in it. Orrin consulted with two Wardens over a line that had been designed for inventory lists and now had become an artery, and he asked them to hum at shift change in the pattern of up and to tie the word to two others that he chose with a skill they had not thought him capable of.\n\nThe others were together and hold. He had seen the radio learn, and he had decided to teach the dead to make new vowels with old mouths. They did not need to say the word love if the bones did not like it; they could say the word hold and the world would hear the two sit together. Ilyria watched him teach the pattern with the careful cruelty of someone who knows that if you give people something too beautiful before they have footings, they will fall. He did it in steps. He counted. The Wardens on the other end made the shape of the sound with their throats and sent it back through wire and promise, and the room had for a minute the crackle of a storm lying down.\n\nPax slept at the desk with his face on his arms, and his back rose and fell as if he were the tide made small. Leta paid the cat with string to tolerate a lap, and in the quiet that understood its job, Ilyria remembered the dark room, and the hand, and the wrong button pressed gently. She thought of the Choir and of the day the replies did not come, and the way silence can behave like a body if you treat it ceremoniously. She realized with a clarity that did not hurt until after that the Concord had not invented the wave. They had found it. They had bent it. They had leaned it toward their kind of civility and called it medicine, and somewhere in their patient records they had a chart full of compliance curves and names that had once belonged to people.\n\nNight came again not to repeat but to continue a sentence. The Council sent a request that was not optional for them to appear at a temporary annex because the Chairwoman had discovered that one of the coils had been installed inside a classroom heater at a school where children had recently learned the multiplication table by hopping on squares of carpet. The Wardens wanted to show them the place where three of their number had stood at a corner and, for four minutes that had felt like an hour, believed themselves to be on parade while the market around them went on doing the ordinary work of living. Leta wanted to tear up the coils one by one and wear them like bracelets so the city would have to ask her to take them off, which was not a plan and not a joke, and Ilyria wanted, suddenly and violently, to go to the place that was neither far nor near and find the breath that was deciding for everyone.\n\nThe place did not have a name. It had several names, which is the same as not having one at all. Some called it the Archive because it had once held blueprints. Some called it the Hall because of the way noise did strange arithmetic there. Some called it the Pylon because it rose out of the ground like an excuse for the sky to gather. The Concord called it a signal cache, because they loved to pretend that there were words that would make the world a filing cabinet. Pax called it the place with the windows that stared back.\n\nThey went because going was better than waiting. Orrin filed nothing except his chin and the angle at which he would stand if he were required to look harmless while holding a wall. Leta packed a bag that would not have cleared a checkpoint anywhere that feared talent, and she stuck the old radio inside because she wanted it to learn again tonight if there was anything worth learning. Ilyria put her coat on and let it be a coat because surprise is a weapon too, and if she arrived as a woman with odd taste rather than as a rumor with feathers, maybe the building would let her thoughts take the stairs.\n\nThe Pylon sat at the end of a street that had decided it could be an avenue if only someone believed in it hard enough. It had windows that did not repeat but variations, and it had a door that had learned too many sizes and would not settle. Inside, the air had been taught to smell like official history, which is to say paper and stone and the breath people hold when they are reading something they want to remember and cannot. A guard at the desk made a show of looking up and of being neutral, and then looked properly at Orrin and could not help the way his eyes softened because some part of him still believed in the dead.\n\nThey let themselves be checked because refusals are also spells, and sometimes you do not want to cast that one. They went up in an elevator designed to make the stomach confess sins, and when the doors opened, Aurek was waiting with a clipboard and a cardigan and a face that had been to a mirror and received no useful advice. He asked them to step into a demonstration chamber as if he were inviting them to stand under a waterfall but promising they would not drown, and he talked about measured exposure and calibration curves and the sort of words that mean we have already done this to someone else and now it is your turn.\n\nThe chamber was a handsome room that had been built to impress people who were already in love with the idea of rooms. The walls were lined with panels that coveted names like baffle and diffuser, and there were speakers that looked like polite sculptures and vents that were not for air. There were chairs made to be sat in by people who do not mind being asked to sit at length. There was a table with water on it and a stack of forms that had decided whether they were contracts or certificates. There was a sound that was not a sound yet and wanted to be.\n\nIlyria stepped very nearly into the center, which is the only place to stand if you mean what you say, and Leta took up a position near a panel that had cantilevered itself like a gossip, and Orrin chose the corner where his absence would have been most conspicuous. Aurek made a small speech without adjectives, which is itself a kind of adjective, and then he raised his hand like a conductor and nodded to the technician behind the glass. The wave entered.\n\nIt was a gentle thing in that second. It arrived as if someone had taught it pleases and thank yous, and it did not push, it persuaded. It showed Ilyria the outline of her own heartbeat and then suggested a more reliable model. It offered the easy rest you feel when you finish a task and convince yourself you do not need to start another. It laid the blank page between two pages with writing and said perhaps later. If she had been almost anyone else, she would have sighed and called it relief.\n\nBut she was not anyone else, and she had spent the night making promises that sounded like hooks, so the wave met a mind with a stage set and a pattern waiting in the curtains. It tried to remove the score and discovered that she knew where the players stood without looking. It attempted to lower the lights and discovered that good music does not need them. It pushed, finally, because persuasion had failed, and in that push was the part that would break bones if bones believed the story of their own obsolescence.\n\nLeta saw it on the monitor in a line that should not have moved that way. She did the only thing she was ever going to do, which was to put the old radio on the table and turn its dial with fingers that had said earlier today they would not be asked to do something like this. Orrin counted aloud, as if reminding a room that stillness was a choice, and his numbers ran like rope. Ilyria said the words she had invented for children and soldiers and dead men who remember, and she folded them over the wave like cloth, and when the breath pressed, it pressed into a shape that said up and together and hold.\n\nThe wave skid. It skid the way a thought skid when you are interrupted by a joke you know is better than the serious thing you intended to say. For a moment that a watch would not admit had happened, it made a new shape where the central breath could be. Aurek\u2019s smile returned to his face in the manner of a person who has decided to act like he owns the conclusion, and he said that they saw that the Bright\u2019s harmonics were of considerable interest and that perhaps there was a way to work together for the improvement of public morale. Ladled over the phrasing was a politeness that had a lid, and under the lid was a thing with spines.\n\nIlyria looked at the glass behind which a man with a headset had been instructed to be precise without being curious. She looked at Aurek\u2019s careful cardigan and at the forms on the table that wanted to be definitions. She thought of the coils hidden in vents and bells and turbines, and of the boy\u2019s itchy place on the map, and of a hand pressing the wrong button gently because gentleness is sometimes a better weapon than force. She did not wait for permission, because when a song knows its chorus, permission is a whistle far away.\n\nShe sang not into the room but into the part of the room that had been kept aside for later. The note was brief because the brief is what they had, and it was steep because she had learned last night what shape made the wave most clumsy, and it carried the smallest possible joke she could write in the moment, which was to pronounce the word hold like a door being held for a stranger you might one day love. It went out through vents not meant for music and into ducts not meant for air, and into the building\u2019s bones that had not been asked whether they wanted to be instruments, and in the floor below them a filing cabinet quietly realigned its contents because it had decided that there were better systems than alphabetical.\n\nThe technician made a sound he had not signed a form to make. Aurek\u2019s hand twitched in a gesture that wanted to be a reach for control and had to settle for control\u2019s cousin, and Orrin laughed without laughing, which changed the pressure of the room enough to allow breathing again. Leta turned the radio off because two seconds had happened at least twice, and Ilyria felt the cost announce itself in the small distance between her core and her edges that would need to be traveled with care later. That was all right. She had been traveling that distance since she had woken to the sky and found no reply.\n\nThey did not break the wave that day. They did not dismantle the coils or topple the Concord out of its careful metaphors. They walked out of the building with the politeness you extend to a house in a neighborhood where children play, and with the co-conspiracy that grows between those who have just not drowned. Pax was waiting at the bottom of the steps with a sandwich wrapped in newsprint that had been printed six months ago because newsprint did not care what day it thought it was, and he handed half to Ilyria and half to Leta as if he had calculated exactly how much bread bravery can eat before it starts to turn useless.\n\nOutside, the city had developed overnight a habit of tapping. People tapped the railings and tabletops and their own cheeks in rhythms that would have been upsetting if you did not know that counting is a way to not be in the cart time is hauling you in. The Wardens found that they could hum under their breath without being asked and the hum did not turn traitor, and a woman in a wheelchair at the corner near the dumpling stall sang into her lap and discovered it made her hands less afraid. The wind had taken to saying the joke about eels to itself, the one that was a code, and the gulls imitated the cadence so convincingly that several men in hats looked up and smiled without meaning to.\n\nNight made its second proposal in two days. They said no by staying up. Leta wrote down how to tune a city so that silly things can hold weight, and she made a list on which she promised to make six very important mistakes tomorrow so that she could find out which ones were worth making again. Orrin did a tour of the perimeter he would have done anyway, except this time he taught a private in stitches a way to count backwards that made the shadow miss a step, and when he came back he brought with him three stories and a coil he had not stolen but had asked very firmly for until someone had decided that giving it to him would be a relief.\n\nIlyria lay on the couch and thought about breath. She thought about the central breath that pushed and refused to claim itself, and about the breaths of children asleep in rooms with their windows cracked to let in the word they had learned today, and about the breath the city itself took when you stand very still on the right hill at dusk and listen for what it thinks of what it is becoming. She decided that she could not undo a wave invented by men who loved patience more than people by being perfect. She could only be insistently beautiful in the most ridiculous way and trust the part of bones that had not agreed to be organized against themselves.\n\nIn the morning, they would go to the school with the heater that had been convinced to sing quietly. In the morning, they would send a message out along the backline that would seem like gossip and become instruction. In the morning, the Council would say the word liability and Orrin would say the word corridor and Leta would say the word seconds, and Pax would draw a circle on the map that would later turn out to be the place where they made the city decide whether it wanted to consent to its own quiet. For now, the old radio muttered to itself like an elderly relative with a puzzle, and the lantern in the alley burned with the stubbornness of a small light that has seen large darkness and refuses to be impressed.Morning did not ask permission to come in; it jimmied the lock and let itself into every window that had remembered to be glass. The old school on Miter Street woke like a creature that had been taught its routine fifty years ago and had learned to forgive every revision. The children arrived in layers, sweaters unbuttoned by the walk, bookbags telling their own clattering story, voices carrying fog inside and sunlight out. A teacher held a clipboard like a shield and smiled in the way adults do when they would like children to trust them with smaller secrets than they deserve. Someone had chalked up times tables and then, on a whim or an accident, inserted a word between the numbers so that nine times six was now up and up, and nobody had erased it because sometimes vandalism is a contribution.\n\nThe heater in Room Seven pretended to be a wall. It hummed as walls hum when they have learned to accept their lives, which is to say it hummed with resignation. Leta asked the custodian for the key to the cage, and the custodian produced a ring that contained twelve keys for doors that had been removed and one for this one, and she made a ceremony of handing it over as if permission were an old religion. The grill came open with a screech that had a note in it that made Pax look up, and the coil revealed itself the way a lie reveals the trick it thinks is best hidden. It had been wound with care and painted to match the dust, and its ends had been tucked under an inch of insulation so that fingers with good intentions would miss it.\n\nIlyria knelt on a scuffed tile that had worn its polish off telling children not to run. The coil sang to her without sound, the way a thing at the edge of hearing will brag quietly to the part of your mind that remembers danger in water. She did not touch metal. She touched the small shaped absence around the metal and convinced it for a breathing\u2019s worth of time that it had never been asked to harden. The heater sighed. That was all it would do for now. The dampening did not like to be dismissed in public.\n\nThe class came in mid-moment. They saw adults near warm mystery and became very still with the particular quiet peculiar to classrooms, a quiet that lives on the edge of eruption. The teacher introduced them all without quite remembering why she trusted them, and the children introduced themselves in a chorus that sounded like people rehearsing for their own names. A girl with one ear glittering said, \u201cAre you the Bright,\u201d as if that were an insult and a compliment, and Ilyria said she was a person who listened to heaters misbehave, which made four children decide to love her exactly until summer.\n\nLeta demonstrated nothing. She asked the children to hum their favorite sound for the count of three, and twenty-three throats produced a rope of noise that was part engine, part bee, and part new shoes on polished floor. Orrin stood in the doorway and watched the windows because old habits make good guards. The little hum filled the room without touching anyone\u2019s fear, and when it faded, Ilyria let a strand of up and together ride in the space the children had made. It wasn\u2019t much. It did not belong to her once she\u2019d let it go. It settled in the heater like forgiveness.\n\nPax chalked a tiny triangle on the baseboard in a place only people who drop their pencils would ever see. He did not explain it, even when the girl with the glittering ear asked if it was a secret code, and when she frowned and asked him if he was older than he looked, he told her he had been old and then forgotten how and had decided to start again. The teacher made a noise that was not permission and not disapproval and then asked the class to sit, because sitting is how you begin magic that pretends to be learning.\n\nThey stayed only long enough to catch the way the coil\u2019s influence had been softened and the way it went looking for sharper corners. On the way out, the custodian pressed Leta\u2019s fingers and said that when she vacuumed the hall last night she had hummed up without meaning to and found herself pushing the machine like it was a dance partner, and she thanked them with her eyes for making a chore agree to be music. Orrin took a list from the teacher, names of students who startled at loud noises and of those who, when asked to sing, preferred to be weather, and he stored those names with the brief tenderness that men who have died often carry for children.\n\nThe Council annex smelled like three different hand soaps choosing dominance. The communications chairwoman had made copies of the poster where UP had pinned SHADOW like a butterfly in a display case, and she spoke in a cadence that turned every phrase into an item number. Liability entered the room as a guest of honor and took a seat where it could be seen. The ringed woman said that the coils represented a breach of something but could not say of what; collar-suit said that the Concord had filed notice with the West Quayside Committee last spring and waved a paper that had nothing to do with anything; the new-book one asked how many songs a person could be expected to carry before they began to confuse themselves with a choir.\n\nLeta said seconds again, and her patience left a mark on the desk like a watermark. She traced a route that would let them try a loud test without breaking anyone who did not consent, and she pointed to the three triangles on her map that she had decided were the places to pin the city so that the cloth of sound would stretch in an even way. She insisted on safe corridors not because she wanted permission but because she understood that permission is a channel you can pour care into. Orrin promised bodies at corners and gentle hands that would become iron if needed; he promised counts and he promised the kind of stillness that can be found in storms. Ilyria described what the cost felt like and did not dramatize it, and in that decision there was more drama than any Council member wanted to own.\n\nThey left with a blessing that pretended to be a caution. The chairwoman handed Leta a badge that would get her past three doors and no guards and called it authority. The ringed woman touched Ilyria\u2019s wrist as if to weigh it and then let her go with an apology written in the skin near her thumb. The man in collar-suit asked Orrin if he slept, and Orrin said he did when other people could afford to, and neither of them mentioned that sleep has a smell you miss.\n\nAurek waited where people who think they understand context like to wait, which is in places where context happens to other people. He had a paper cup and the relaxed shoulders of someone who believes that proposals sound kinder near a coffee cart. He said the Concord\u2019s pilot had two weeks left before the next phase, which would be distribution to additional cities, at which point alterations would be expensive for everyone involved. He offered a form of partnership that would let Glass Harbor claim co-authorship of the solution, and he offered Leta a stipend and Orrin a separate chain of command and Ilyria a room full of microphones and the myth of control.\n\nNobody answered him in the language he wanted. Leta thanked him for putting his mouth where they could see it and then turned her back to call the depot and ask if the night guard liked licorice. Orrin did not step closer, which is a way of stepping farther away. Ilyria told him politely that music does not belong to governments, which flustered him not because he disagreed but because he had not expected to be asked to agree. Pax wandered by with a roll of tape and a look that said he would gladly tie this man's shoelaces together if it would save a life.\n\nThey could feel the wave tighten. It is a strange thing to know a pressure that is not air. The dampening gathered itself that afternoon the way someone gathers arguments before sitting across from a friend they intend to lose. The backline burred with small alarms only people who loved the backline could hear. Leta called out the points with the finality of an oath\u2014Depot, Drumhouse rim, Spindle Yard\u2014and Ilyria could feel the ampersands between them like handclasps. Orrin sent two squads along the upper streets to act as bluish lights in fog, the sort that tell a boat which way a shore has chosen to be true.\n\nThey deployed at a pace that was not quite a run and not quite a march, and the city seemed to step aside to make room for necessity. At the depot, under the roof that had learned everyone\u2019s footsteps, Leta rerouted music like a plumber with a grudge and tuned the trestles with a mallet until they stopped sulking about their rust. At the Yard, Ilyria made the turbines complicit in a petty act of rebellion and smiled when they rose to the occasion like small dogs delighted to be considered wolf. On Drumhouse\u2019s rim, Pax set down six tin cans in a line and told each a secret none of the others would forgive, and he listened to the difference like he was learning to read weather.\n\nThe Wardens became choir in the gutters between. They did not sing, not in the way people fear and envy, but they allowed their breathing to be counted aloud at corners and they watched their own faces when the dampening pressed, and they held each other the way dancers do when they have agreed on this, this, now. Orrin did not tell them to be brave. He told them to be specific. He told them that when the pressure came, it would feel like someone trying to finish a sentence for them, and that their best answer was a silly word they would not have thought worthy of a war. They practiced not because practice makes perfect but because practice makes habit, and habit is what you fall to when gravity argues.\n\nIt came in a half hour of afternoon most people have always thought belongs to no one. The dampening spread like fog under doors and decided to be heavy. A trolley stalled with its doors open and passengers inside laughed that brittle laughter people laugh when they do not want to call a thing by its name. A preacher in a pocket park forgot mid-harangue why he had trained his voice the way you train a dog. At the pier, three gulls landed in a triangle and did not move and every fisherman who saw them made the sign he had inherited from a grandfather who had superstitions tattooed on his knuckles.\n\nLeta\u2019s voice hit the backline like a pebble on a tin roof. She did not shout because shouting is a drug that does not do what you hope. She said now with the authority of the person who has watched your face for days and knows exactly which second of your asking is real. The depot vibrated into readiness. Drumhouse lifted its head. The Yard spun slyer and made its own wind. Ilyria closed her eyes and made her mind small on purpose.\n\nThe hook was not a weapon; it was a chair set out in the middle of panic. She gave the city a place to sit. Up and together and hold went out in a pattern that had learned patience. It did not claw. It did not wrestle. It became background the way your heartbeat does until you remember it is there and are grateful for the proof. The dampening ran into that shape and found itself briefly obliged to occupy it, and in the instant before it twisted free, it forgot what it had intended to do. In that forgetting, people finished sentences. Someone inside the trolley sang two notes in a voice like wire and someone else laughed like water falling, the good way.\n\nGlass Harbor did not become safe. It did become less alone. The wave tightened again, and the wind obeyed their mirrors and errored gently, and the heaters in unnumbered rooms sounded like old men clearing their throats before saying something honest. Leta cued a sound into the backline that in any other city would have been a joke about a broken traffic light and here became a request that everyone at a window tap twice and then twice again, and for a thin, unphotogenic minute, the city sounded like rain remembered itself.\n\nThe push ebbed because even pressure needs leverage. The coils kept doing their work, patient traitors to their hosts, and Aurek\u2019s building sent a pulse that was measured and kind until you noticed the fact of its existence at all. People went back to their markets and to their supper tables and to their dogs, who forgave the panic because they always do. Ilyria sat on the parapet of the Yard and let her wings be not a coat, and she put her forehead on her arm and swallowed the ache that had come as promised. She had spent only seconds, but seconds in the right place draw blood from a person who has decided to be bridge instead of bank.\n\nPax climbed up beside her with the unconscious grace of children who have not been told that grace is rare. He gave her half an apple that had seen better days and he told her, matter-of-fact, that his aunt had cried at the sink when a silence left their house like a guest they had been afraid to ask to leave. He asked her if the big song would hurt the city forever, the one she kept telling them would have to happen, and she could not lie to him properly because honesty had decided, recently, to be her hobby.\n\n\u201cIt will change what your bones reach for,\u201d she said, and because he was a child and did not have as many useless words to put between himself and truth, he nodded like a small judge and said that he would make his bones learn to reach for good things.\n\nOrrin found them with the walk of a man who has just finished doing a thing that matters and is suspicious of any room that offers praise. He checked Ilyria with his eyes like a medic who has learned to take a pulse without touching, and then he said the Wardens below had made a choice he wanted her to hear before it hardened into ritual without options. They had decided to teach their new recruits a different three-part count, one that said hold on me in the first part and hold on each other in the second and hold on the city in the third. He wanted to know if she thought that was right.\n\n\u201cI think you make a better priest than I do,\u201d she said, and he laughed softly in the way a man laughs when you hand him a word he never wanted and it fits anyway. Leta joined them with a fistful of wire ties and a look of bruised victory, and she said that someone down at the depot had called her their mayor without policy, and she had pretended not to like it, and they all sat with that for a minute and let themselves be unheroic.\n\nThey needed an answer to the central breath. They could not keep pushing back forever, not with candy and stubbornness. Leta laid the map on the roof again because roofs are what maps deserve, and she circled the places where the wave refused to slip and then circled them again, and the circles began to draw in a shape she hadn\u2019t intended. It was a half-ring, a necklace the city wore low. It traced the seawall and then dipped under in three places where maintenance forgot to go and where the old city had kept secrets even from itself. It pointed.\n\nPax told them a story about drains. He told them about the time last winter when the drains had clogged and the floodwater made a slow and persuasive argument with basements all along Spindle Yard, and how the men with tools had opened access doors that were not on any drawing and found not only pipes but blue ceramic tunnels the size of two men side by side, and how within those tunnels were little doors and older doors and a door with a window that stared back. He had not been allowed inside, except in the way children are not allowed inside which is to say as far as they can fit and no farther, and he had seen a mural of circles and lines that older people would call an engineering diagram and he had called instructions for a dancing machine.\n\nIlyria thought of the hand with the scar pressing the wrong button gently. She thought of how old cities carry hymns under their sewage, how cathedrals pour their voices into cisterns so that saints and rats can share them. She did not need to say the word archive or pylon. She said the word throat, and everyone understood. The city\u2019s voice had been routed through a mouth it did not know it had. The Concord, who liked to pretend that names could defang things, had found that mouth and given it vowel shapes it would not have chosen. If they could reach that throat, they could convince it to bite differently.\n\nThere was a brief and practical argument that somehow did not become a fight. Orrin wanted to send three squads and a rope and a pack that a pack animal could wear, never mind that no pack animal could be persuaded to climb down into a storm mouth in a city that smelled of itself. Leta wanted light and a transceiver that would bounce off ceramic and patience. Pax wanted to go because of course he did. Ilyria wanted only to be looked at like a tool and not like an answer, and when they managed it for a few minutes, her shoulders let the day in.\n\nThey planned as if planning could bless an outcome, and when evening arrived with its pockets full of harbor sounds, they went to the place where the seawall stopped pretending to be a wall and became a long story. The access hatch had been painted the shade of urgency that bureaucracies like, and it had rusted in the particular pattern of neglect that is a form of confidence. Two Wardens worked the bolts with quiet curses\u2014the old-fashioned kind that aren\u2019t about anyone\u2019s mother but about tools\u2014and when the cover came up, the breath from below could have been mistaken for cold if you did not know how disguised breath can be.\n\nPax went first until three hands caught him. He glared in the direction of adulthood and let himself be the fourth to descend, which he would tell later as if he had conceded nothing. Leta followed with a bag that had no right to weigh what it weighed and yet did, and her hair caught on a bolt and stayed there like a marker. Orrin took a ladder as if the ladder might have feelings, which is how you keep ladders from betraying you. Ilyria folded her wings enough to be courteous and climbed last, and in the darkness that accepted them without commentary, it was easy to be only a person.\n\nThe tunnels were older than manners. Ceramic lined them in the pale blue shade that cities choose when they are pretending water is easier than it is. The walls had been taught not to echo, which meant every sound they made sounded like a promise instead of a threat. There were signs painted by hands that did not have the word signage yet, arrows and circles and the occasional fish that might once have told a man with a bucket whether he would need an extra man with a rope. The air carried a rhythm that was not footsteps and not pumps, and Ilyria felt the way it counted without numbers. It was the city measuring itself.\n\nThey walked with the discipline that keeps groups from becoming noise. Pax kept ahead exactly far enough to make his point. Leta touched valves and named them like she was introducing two old friends who had forgotten how to shake hands. Orrin stopped the column once, twice, to let an imagined patrol pass, because if you practice against an enemy you pretend harder first. At a junction where three tunnels argued over purpose, the old radio in Leta\u2019s bag woke and made a shy noise, and she set it on the ceramic like a turtle finding a warm rock. The noise aligned itself with the rhythm in the walls, and the word up did not come because it had nothing to climb.\n\nThey reached the throat by not looking for it. It announced itself in negative, a place where sound did not behave as it had promised. The tunnel opened into a chamber that had been designed without architects and later dignified by technicians. Cables crossed like mistakes corrected. A wheel with teeth sat against a wall not connected to anything anyone could justify but too heavy to discard, and if Ilyria put her palm near it without touching, her hand remembered the way a hum has weight. In the center of the room was a column that had been poured and then cut. You could see the hand in the cut. You could see the patience.\n\nIt did not feel dangerous until they stepped toward it. Danger is not always a sensation; sometimes it is the awareness that you are inside an instrument and you do not know who is holding the bow. The column was full of air and not air. It was a tuned emptiness. Around its base were coils of the same persuasion as the ones in the heaters and bells, but larger, and nested like toys with ambitions. A panel on the wall bore a plaque with serial numbers and a date that had been scratched and re-stamped, which is how you know something has been made legal retroactively.\n\nLeta stood very still and let her eyes do the counting. She traced the path the pressure took and the return that kept it honest. She did not touch anything because touching is a language and she had not been taught this dialect. Orrin bent and read the plaque out loud, not because the numbers mattered but because speaking them took power away from the part of the world that pretended they were gods. Pax whispered that if you whistled here the whole city would whistle back, and Ilyria believed him too much to try.\n\nThe wave came through even here, thinner, like music someone is playing in a room down the hall when the door is open only a hand\u2019s width. It spoke in what it thought was common sense. It suggested that tiredness was a better use of time than action. It proposed that waiting was prudent. It made rest into law. Ilyria stood in front of the column and felt that gathering pressure stand at her back like a boy who would shove and then apologize politely. She put her hand to the emptiness and did not push. She offered it a joke.\n\nThe joke was a childish thing about doors. She did not have the leisure to craft elegance. She took the word hold from the day and folded it into what engineers call a defect and children call a weakness they can poke. She let hold mean doorstop. She asked the tuned emptiness if it had considered that a door held open on purpose is an invitation rather than a failure. She sang the tiniest note the column would accept without either shattering or laughing at her, and in that note was the dumb joy of songs people write for kitchens and unions.\n\nIt accepted it. That was all. It did not give back. It did not reform the world. It allowed the idea that an open door is a choice to sit near its root. The coils around the base did not cease their work, and Aurek\u2019s technicians would, in a room with good lighting, see no change they could justify to a budget, but in the city above, six people forgot to stop talking midway and continued instead, and one man put down a bottle he had needed and did not feel insulted by the absence of his need.\n\nThey could not stay. Water, which cares little for the wars of breath, announced an approaching duty with a sound someone had taught it for that very purpose. Orrin gathered them with a gesture that had kept men alive before, and they left as carefully as they had come. On the ladder up to air, Pax turned and looked down into the blue and said, to the column and to anyone else who might be listening, that he liked his city better when it remembered itself, and then he climbed into a night that had decided to test them again tomorrow.\n\nAboveground, Glass Harbor wore the look of a person who has smiled so long their cheeks are tired and they wonder whether it is acceptable to stop. The lantern in the alley still burned with its ridiculous faith. The old radio in Leta\u2019s bag made a sound that said it had learned a new vowel and would be smug about it. Orrin walked the block twice before letting himself lean against a wall, and when he did the wall seemed to feel better. Ilyria sat on the couch and did not pretend not to shake. Leta said that she would make tea and then forgot and instead began listing inventory on a scrap of paper because sometimes mercy arrives as bureaucracy.\n\nThey had not won anything you could put in a box. They had not toppled anyone or anything except a few small arguments inside machines. They had gifted the throat a doorstop and the city a silliness it might not have picked up on its own. When Ilyria fell asleep she did it with her mouth open like a child, and in the part of sleep that allows speech she said the word together as if testing whether it could do anything but mean itself. The city, which had not so much been saved as reminded, said it back in the tap of pipes and the brush of a cat choosing a lap, and under the seawall a column held one new idea it had not wanted and could not yet refuse.The day after the throat, the city behaved like someone who had found a foreign coin in their pocket and decided to buy coffee with it anyway. The stalls went up with the same practiced choreography and the same arguments about price and cricket scores and the moral adequacy of pears out of season, but the pauses were softer in the middle and shorter at the edges. People completed thoughts they had gotten used to abandoning. A woman on a balcony who had made a profession of sighing into the street discovered she could climb down the sigh like a ladder into ordinary laughter without slipping. On the seawall, a Warden who had ceased to hear the long note the harbor holds under its breath felt it return like a muscle waking, and he blinked as if a bird had flown very close and not quite touched his cheek.\n\nThe coils did not stop. They were patient machines and they had learned patience from men who liked to call it safety. In the bell tower, Orrin ran his hands along the braille of the bronze and felt the way the dampening used the metal to carry the idea of harmlessness. He taught the young ones to count with their tongues against their teeth instead of with their breath, because the wave had not yet learned that teeth can be metronomes. In the depot, Leta\u2019s name had become a rumor the rails were willing to repeat; when she walked under the roof, the girders produced a brief, improving hum as if to suggest they were thinking about posture, and she nodded at them with the rude affection she reserved for things she loved that were not people.\n\nIlyria slept in installments and woke as if she had been sketched between two lines and now had to choose which line to belong to. The hook in her head had developed a habit of waiting at thresholds with its hat on; it would not push in without being asked, which was an elegance she did not expect of pop. She went with Leta to collect clean background noise\u2014children dropping pencils exactly where Pax\u2019s triangles had been chalked, a kettle boiling in a courtyard where the laundry argued with the wind, a bicycle chain being oiled by a man who tuned it like a guitar\u2014and she kept the sounds in her mind like seed. When she had enough for a moment, she would hand it back brightened. Until then she was a jar with a lid.\n\nAurek sent three messages through three different channels, which was the bureaucratic equivalent of leaving flowers on a stoop in the rain. One came on paper with a watermark that had been designed to look like it had always existed; one came through the Council on a surplus of courtesy; and one came in person at the edge of a schoolyard where boys were teaching each other to fall and land without smacking their teeth. He made offers that would have sat very well in a document full of diagrams. He spoke about a codicil that would allow their \u201ccivic chorus\u201d\u2014he tried the phrase and found it flattering\u2014into the suite of officially sanctioned morale instruments. He promised to protect the Wardens\u2019 \u201coperational autonomy\u201d so long as Orrin could agree to certain paths and certain silences. He described a room where Ilyria could \u201cprototype\u201d and \u201cscale\u201d without being subject to the full taste of the wave. His cardigan had pilled in an honest way; his shoes were dishonest. Pax took two steps between Ilyria and the pitch and stood there with his arms crossed and his pockets full of tape as if he were waiting to see how the world behaved when a child declared a boundary.\n\nLater, in the studio where mercy wore the face of lists, Leta drew a line down the center of a page and wrote his name on one side and the word wind on the other and set about assigning favors to one column and debts to the other. \u201cHe\u2019ll try to write us into his story,\u201d she said, and blew on the ink because she liked the way drying looked. \u201cWe write us into ours first. Then if the texts overlap, we can argue about footnotes.\u201d\n\nThey worked like thieves and like monks. Orrin borrowed two hours from sleep to design a drill that taught the dead how to switch counts without thought, the way a dancer can catch a new rhythm by watching shoulders. He stood a line of Wardens in a narrow street with windows that had learned to listen and gave them a pattern simple enough to be stupid and asked them to hold their mouths still while they did it. He watched the old habit of parade rise in their spines like a tide and be pushed back by the ridiculousness of up in the second beat. One boy\u2014he would always be a boy to Orrin until he apologized for it and the boy had gotten old enough to forgive him\u2014laughed and then clamped his mouth shut and looked guilty and then learned to keep the laugh on the inside of his face like a light kept under a hand. Orrin called that progress and did not tell anyone his dead could be taught to be less dead with jokes.\n\nThe itchy star on Pax\u2019s map itched louder. \u201cIt\u2019s not that nothing makes sense there,\u201d he said, toeing a crack in the pavement like he had discovered a river under it and was testing the depth with his shoe. \u201cIt\u2019s that everything makes a different kind of sense than it should, and then pretends to be normal. Like when my aunt says she doesn\u2019t mind if I\u2019m late if I\u2019m having adventures when we both know she minds a specific amount she\u2019s not going to tell me.\u201d The star was a wedge between a shuttered cinema and a warehouse that had been reinvented as six other professions and currently practiced none. The shutters had been painted three times in three different blues, and someone with a compassionate ladder had pasted an old movie poster on one door at a scale that made the actors\u2019 eyes too big for their faces, which gave the impression that the door was staring.\n\nThey found a way in because cities want to be read. The side door had forgotten its lock, and the corridor inside smelled like sawdust that had developed a social life in the absence of carpenters. Room by room they found the traces of the warehouse\u2019s past decisions\u2014a coat closet that thought it was a confessional, an office that remembered tickets, a loading dock that had been convinced to be a stage for three months in a summer when everyone was allowed to pretend their lives were going to rehearse forever. In the basement, where basements keep the climate of old quarrels, a space opened that had been carefully, lovingly, deliberately misused for a very long time. The walls had been painted a shade of red that was interested in becoming velvet; the pillars had been wrapped and unwrapped; the floor had been chalked by a hundred hands teaching other hands where to put feet.\n\nPeople were there who did not startle at discovery. They were the sort of people cities make when the law and mercy have decided to take turns and no one is satisfied with the schedule. A grandmother with eyes the color of daylight through tea held court on a stack of folded tarps. A boy with ten fingers and nine rings held a screwdriver like it was genius given a metal body. Two women with hair the color of decisions stitched tiny brass bells to the hem of a skirt that had been an old flag, and when they saw the newcomers, they rose without rising and made of the room a threshold.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not on any committee,\u201d the tea-grandmother said. Her voice had the texture of a good alley. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who catch the parts of a city that get dropped. When someone learns a new way to survive, they bring it here so it doesn\u2019t get lonely.\u201d She did not ask who Ilyria was because there are names people do not need; she asked what she was carrying and whether she meant to put it down on purpose.\n\n\u201cI have a chorus dressed as a joke,\u201d Ilyria said, because sometimes plainness is the seduction people deserve. \u201cAnd the world is using subtraction as if it were kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d the grandmother said. \u201cKindness is always being mugged in the nicer neighborhoods.\u201d She tapped the hem of the flag-skirt and bells answered. \u201cWe keep a cantus here. Not because we are ancient or important. Because no one asked the living to learn the city\u2019s long notes. They gave those to the stone and the dioceses. We take them back. Not as a hymn. As infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThey sang nothing out loud. They showed Ilyria instead the way the room remembered vibrato. They walked her through a set of movements no longer used for dance but useful for convincing a chest to lift and then to lift again. They ran her hand along a length of wire strung between two iron rings that had held curtains that had hidden mistakes and instructed her to listen to the way the wire did not lose its note when jostled if you told it not to. Pax found a box of metronomes that had once been charming and now were just precision and set six going at slightly wrong tempos and then delighted in making them agree without touching them because the room had a heartbeat willing to argue. Leta took notes with the humility of a thief stealing from a temple and planning to apologize later by putting flowers on steps.\n\n\u201cI knew a Bright once,\u201d the grandmother said, while they stood inside a square of light that had been cut into the face of the afternoon by accident. \u201cHe was not as good as you. He was wilder and colder and he didn\u2019t know he was on fire. He burned and was gone and his singing stayed, which is cheap. I don\u2019t like cheap. If you are going to stay, make sure you cost people their habits. If you are going to go, make sure you leave the door open.\u201d She tapped her temple. \u201cHe forgot to ask a question before he sang. He forgot to ask who would be carrying his hook when he was not around to hold the other end.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not forget,\u201d Ilyria said. It was a vow with its hair down, which is the only kind she trusted these days.\n\nThey were learning speed. The wave was learning them back. It came late that afternoon like weather that had called ahead. You could feel the Concord behind it, the way a recipe feels the hand that has made it too many times without tasting. Aurek did not hide. He watched from a corner of the depot with a face arranged for neutrality and a pen that wrote extra notes he did not need. He asked no questions because the questions themselves were treason for a man in his position. He looked, briefly, like a person and then remembered and became a representative again. Leta\u2019s mouth saw it and made a small shape that might once have been pity.\n\nThe city had a plan this time. It stood at the three points Leta had drawn and breathed in odd counts. It let the silly words sit within the work, not on top of it, and it made of them not a banner but a scaffolding. The dampening pushed and found itself obligingly guided into places where it could do the least harm, as if a storm had tried to enter a house and discovered rugs. Children in a schoolyard ran in a pattern adults would not have recognized as tactical and in doing so stopped their own panic before it got the idea to change names. A man in cutting gloves who hated songs hummed against his better judgment because his coworker\u2019s hands were shaking and he could tell you do not fix shaking with instruction. The Wardens made a hum that had nothing to do with death and stood with their faces arranged in a way that told anyone who wanted to notice that dignity can be an act of rebellion if you show it your teeth first.\n\nIlyria kept the hook at her teeth and let only a thread out. She could feel the temptation to throw it all\u2014pop like floodwater\u2014into the pipes and watch the city get wet with insistence. It would work. It would make a different problem. She did not do it because she had promised herself a particular cruelty: to cure a city slowly enough that its healing would be owned by hands other than hers. She saved the big song the way you save a bridge you could cross now but might need later when the river is more dramatic.\n\nWhen the pressure relented, a boy in a corner shop put his hand over the radio and whispered thank you like prayer and the radio, which had learned to be a person in small ways, whirred in grateful embarrassment. Aurek watched the Wardens shake out their shoulders, observed the way the city does not break when people insist on their own ridiculous competence, and said, almost to himself, that the numbers were going to be very difficult to explain. Then he said it louder, to Ilyria, and he tried on honesty in a tiny size: \u201cIf you force this into policy, people I work for will become worse. They will punish with language.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t work for them,\u201d Pax said, with the hopeless power of children. \u201cOr lie to them in a way that helps us. Or learn to run fast. I am very good at running. I can teach you.\u201d He offered his hand as if to pull the man into a version of the city where he would trip on his own reasons and be forced to laugh.\n\n\u201cI have duties,\u201d Aurek said. It was not quite an apology and not quite a boast. His hand flexed over his clipboard. Ilyria thought of the scar across a palm in an old room pressing the wrong button gently, and for a moment she saw him sitting at a kitchen table with a woman who could not count the names of all the cities because the list was longer than a life, and she almost forgave him for language he had learned in rooms with glass walls.\n\nThe Council split the way councils do, along muscles that no one had realized they were building. The ringed woman advocated mischief with a smile you could cut yourself on. The man in collar-suit wanted to draft an accord whose map had corridors that could be defended with stacked chairs. The chairwoman of communications made a beautiful schedule and then, with very small hands, tore it into strips and wove it again into something that looked like permission. The new-book one wrote down everything and then put the notebook in their bag and told no one what they would do with the words, which was probably the most alarming decision in the room.\n\nThat night they found Marrowdale not where he had been told to be and not where any sensible dread would lead your feet. They found him in a little room under a staircase where old mops went to remember their lives, sitting on a bucket with his hands on his knees and his eyes looking wrong because something was in there that had not been asked. He was smiling the way a person smiles when a doctor who is too young tells them something their bones have known longer than the doctor has had bones. Orrin crouched the way he would crouch for a shard in a heel and said the boy\u2019s name as a question and then said a number six beats and then eight and then returned to four, and watched the smile fade like a bruise bleached by time.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Marrowdale said, and the sorry was to the bucket and to the mops and to God in case God was bored and had decided to come down and see about drains. \u201cI heard a room. I think it was a room. It was not like ours. There were lights that shone into you and lines like veins that were not, and someone said hold and I knew they were lying because their teeth did not say it.\u201d His fingers tapped a pattern he had not been taught and when he realized it he looked at his hand as if it had joined a choir without permission. \u201cI walked out of my perimeter because I wanted to find a door I could stand in and not be a wall. Does that make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes military sense,\u201d Orrin said, and smiled with the part of his mouth that remembered being twenty and stupid and alive. \u201cYou are going to think you invented that feeling. You did not. But you will get to improve it.\u201d\n\nThey put a bed in the studio that was not a bed but a stack of old theater cushions someone had left under the tarp in the basement. The cat looked offended for two minutes and then forgave the intrusion because the cushions held the heat of jokes. Leta wrote on the wall in pencil so she could change her mind without feeling like a vandal: a sequence of signals that would let them ladder up from small to big if they had to climb fast. She tucked among the numbers the reminder that two seconds could be a day if you made your mouth behave. Ilyria sat in a chair with her feet tucked up and her coat obedient and listened to the far places asking to be sung into, and she did not go yet. She waited until the desire to be useful stopped sounding like an argument with her own vanity.\n\nMorning arrived as an apology for not being night\u2019s equal. The gull that had once been a handkerchief and then had learned it was a gull again came by the window and made a comment about fish that no one understood. Pax came with a bag of oranges that had been bullied into ripeness and a book of matches he had earned by not using them yesterday. The backline murmured as if gossip had decided to convert into policy, and the wave, distant and patient, tasted the edges of their net and retreated as a cat retreats from a tub whose water looks like a dare.\n\nThey could not postpone forever. They could feel the Concord\u2019s schedule the way you feel a staircase in the dark after you have counted three steps and remain convinced there is a fourth. Leta put down her pencil hard enough to make a noise that sparked the cat, and said, \u201cWe can make small weather all week and we will win squares on the map and lose other squares and by Thursday someone at a desk with a plant will press a harmless-looking button and the baseline will tick up and we will get tired. Or we can put the big silly song where it belongs and eat the indigestion and see who throws up first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will pay,\u201d Ilyria said, and Orrin made the face he made when men volunteered to die for their friends and forgot that the living would have to keep living with it. \u201cNo,\u201d she added, and he blinked like someone who had been slapped in a meeting. \u201cI mean, of course I will pay. But we can distribute the cost. That\u2019s what cities are for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much do you need,\u201d Leta said. She did not mean batteries.\n\n\u201cA hill\u2019s worth of permission,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cThree points to anchor. A moment when the wind is arrogant. A hundred people who will do something very silly on purpose at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cA hundred is a small number,\u201d Pax said. \u201cI can find a hundred. I can find a hundred before lunch. I can find two hundred if lunch is late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it at Midday Wind,\u201d Orrin said, and the Wardens who were not there to hear agreed in the part of the room that keeps men standing. \u201cThe cranes will act as teeth. Drumhouse will act as a bowl and spit the sound back into the sky. The depot will complain but it will hold. We will keep the corners and stand at the doors. We will tell the young ones to look at someone they love when it happens instead of at the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouncil,\u201d Leta said, as a curse and as an apology. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to vote on whether votes matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can vote while they walk to their windows,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cIt won\u2019t ruin the democracy if a decision arrives before a piece of paper does.\u201d\n\nThey sent Pax like a rumor with legs. They sent women with baskets who could smuggle messages under bouquets. They sent a Warden with a sewing kit into a barracks that had banned needles and watched him come out with six hems that had, for no reason anyone could justify, tiny bells stitched where only a breeze would find them. Leta\u2019s voice moved along the backline in a pattern that sounded like instructions for a dance people would think they were not qualified for until they saw someone else do it badly and realize that was the point. The cat slept with a paw over its eyes because cats hate changes to schedules.\n\nAurek came with his cardigan and his mouth full of policy and did not, to his credit, ask them not to. He told them there would be a test from the Concord at four, and that it would be dressed as a flood warning which would let it use the siren grid, and he told them this not because he had become their friend but because somewhere in his careful chest a button had been pressed wrong and he needed to see if pressing the right button would hurt. \u201cI do not have the authority to stop it,\u201d he said, and the honesty sat ridiculous in his mouth and looked around at the company and decided to stay. \u201cIf you answer with your song, there will be numbers in reports that I will be asked to explain. If you do not, there will be other numbers. I am not immune to arithmetic. I am telling you where the river will crest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a weather vane pretending to be a tree,\u201d Leta said, not unkind. \u201cThank you for pointing.\u201d\n\nHe left with his shoulders like laundry on a line in a wind that refuses to admit it is kindness. Orrin stood a little longer near the door than he needed to as if to make sure the man was not followed by ghosts, and then went to tell the dead that they would do something beautiful on purpose and that they were free to dislike it.\n\nAt midday the cranes pinched the sky and the sea opened its voice like a throat that had decided not to clear itself first. People stood in doorways the way people stand to watch storms from porches, not because they believe themselves safe but because they want to be taller than the day for a minute. The hundred became three hundred and then became a number that did not bother to argue with counting. Children in uniforms that had been washed out of their original color by love jumped on chalk squares and shouted up as if they had discovered levitation and needed you to clap to keep them from falling. A fishmonger whistled and made of his knives a percussion section. A tram came in late and forgave itself.\n\nIlyria climbed to Drumhouse\u2019s lip and stood where the wind keeps its letters. She did not open the coat because surprise had had its turn today and she had decided not to lean on it. She opened her mouth and did what she had promised the tea-grandmother and herself: asked a question out loud before she sang. She asked who would carry this afterward. She asked who would teach it wrong on purpose so that it could survive correctors. She asked who would forgive it for being too easy in a world that respects difficulty like a religion. The city answered by breathing together. That had to be enough.\n\nShe let the song happen. It was silly. It was earnest. It was a chorus about stairs. It was a chorus about hands held across markets and across barracks and across gates that were not locked but were heavy. It did not pretend to be high art and it did not ask permission to be useful. It wore the word up like a hat and the word together like a coat and the word hold like a joke told twice. It was two seconds long and then not two seconds because the echo longed to be a third, and Leta\u2019s hand closed on the dial that stopped it from becoming greed. Orrin\u2019s count slid like rope under a ship\u2019s belly. Pax jumped on three steps in a row and decided he was a human metronome and therefore invincible.\n\nThe wave arrived with its sirens. It wore flood as a mask and math as a suit. It came through the grid like a polite invader who has written ahead to ask for tea preferences and then drinks what you did not offer. It hit the city where the coils were strongest and found, unexpectedly, that the air had been furnished. Little words got in the way. Little laughs made friction. Bones shifted their listening. The dead, who have all the time in the world and none at all, chose a tempo that made the wave smother itself in the folds of the chorus like a blanket put over a birdcage to tell a bird it is night. For two heartbeats and then three and then something ungenerous of time, it faltered.\n\nGlass Harbor did not leap. It lifted. People finished chewing and swallowed. A boy on a bicycle did not crash into a cart because the woman with the cart reached without thinking and moved it in a way that let him pass. A man who had intended to punch another man at a corner because his temper needed exercise opened his hand and clapped instead, which earned him a jeer and then a handshake entirely against everyone\u2019s brand. The cranes turned and the wind behaved and the gulls made jokes about eels because they were learning to be complicit.\n\nAurek watched from a roof he had not earned. He watched with something that could have been grief if it had been allowed to grow. He took his clipboard and used it as a tray for his doubt. He realized that if this became policy, someone would kill it with kindness. He realized that if it did not, someone would kill it with force. He felt for a pocket he did not have and did not find a hand.\n\nAfter, it was quieter than it had any right to be. The sirens had made their wolves and sat, embarrassed. People went back to their oranges and to their arguments and to performing goodness without calling it anything, and in that returning was the victory nobody would celebrate because it required only competence and not spectacle. Leta put her head against the transmitter as if to thank it for being a boat. The cat, who had slept through glory, yawned so hard it made the room change its mind about the importance of achievements. Orrin sat down in the way men sit down when they remember that chairs are a technology.\n\nIlyria shook. She did it in public because if you take a city\u2019s breath you should let it see you breathe. Pax put both hands on her knee and did not say anything except with his palms, which had learned not to be afraid of being useful. The cost was not a dramatic bleeding or a fall. It was the feeling of a stage being dismantled in the body that had held it, a series of ropes being untied from ribs and the brain complaining about the indignity of having been a street for so many feet and now wanting to be a room again. She hated it, and she loved it, because it meant she had not built a bridge out of parts people would miss.\n\nAt dusk, the throat under the seawall\u2014who had been offered a doorstop and had kept it\u2014moved its breath once in a way it had not known how to. In a room in the Pylon with glass walls and polite water, a technician with a scar across his palm pressed a button gently that had been designed to be pressed hard. In a report that would be written tomorrow and then edited for tone, someone would say the pilot had encountered a localized resonance and would propose more coils and stricter baselines and a different cadence for sirens, because policy prefers to evolve by adding teeth rather than by learning to chew differently.\n\nThat night the tea-grandmother came to the studio with a jar of preserved lemons the color of certain vows and told Ilyria a story that had nothing to do with the Choir and everything to do with it. She spoke about a girl who had learned that saying her own name out loud made men listen to their hair more than to her, and so she taught the town to call her by a word that meant water when they needed bread and bread when they needed water, and in the gap they found a way to give each other ungoverned concentrations of love. She said that when the world wants to organize you, you can either become a file folder or become a storm. The lemons were very good; they made Ilyria\u2019s mouth forget to be afraid for a minute.\n\nThey did not sleep long enough. No one does in a city that is learning a new instrument. The phone that was not a phone but thought it could be made a gently embarrassed sound at three a.m. and Leta sat up and swore in a language she would claim tomorrow not to know. The Wardens at the Lake Gate had found three of their number standing very still with the wrong smiles and had counted them back with difficulty, and when asked what they had seen, the three had said in three different words that all meant the same thing: a room without edges. In the morning, Aurek sent a message that had breathing marks where only punctuation ought to be and said the next phase had been moved up. He did not write the word sorry anywhere, which was either cowardice or a kindness to no one needed to hear.\n\n\u201cThen we are on our own clock,\u201d Leta said, and reminded herself to drink water. \u201cWe will make the net talk to itself. We will ask the city to keep what it took today and to say no to lesser kindness tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after,\u201d Orrin said. He did not let his voice carry because voices can make things true and he was not ready for true. \u201cAfter this, they will come with a different story and a different cardigan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be louder,\u201d Ilyria said, and smiled like a bad hand played well. \u201cAnd dumber. And kinder. And if they outlaw the words we like, we will use the ones they leave lying around because they don\u2019t like how they taste.\u201d\n\nPax turned the preserved lemons jar upside down to catch the last amount of light in it and then made a face because the taste had decided to be surprising. He said he wanted to go back to the blue tunnels and draw pictures on the throat so that when it learned new vowels it would have a cartoon to look at, and no one told him it was foolish because sometimes that is engineering and sometimes it is magic and often it is both. He looked at Ilyria and did not say be careful because children do not have patience for better phrasing and in his eyes the command and the wish sat together.\n\nIn the part of the night that thinks it can pass for morning if it wears the right cologne, Ilyria lay with the coat refusing to pretend and let the city talk through her bones. She saw the Choir again, not as beautiful ghosts but as tired people with anger they had never admitted because divinity had seemed like a better brand. She knew, suddenly and without comfort, that the silence which had taken them had not been an absence but a choice made about what noise was allowed to call itself necessary. She knew that she would have to break something she loved about the way music held itself to rules to keep girls in schoolyards from being ushered into perfect quiet by men with data. She did not cry because crying is sometimes selfish and sometimes useful and she could not tell which it would be now, and she needed to save selfishness for when it would save someone else.\n\nIn the morning she would go to the throat with Pax and a stick of charcoal and write the word together on a column that did not care for words, and the word would leave no mark anyone could see and would nevertheless be hard to clean. In the morning Orrin would tell a Warden to go home and hold a child until the child got bored, and the Warden would do it and discover the kind of fatigue that makes you better at war because it remembers what you are fighting against becoming. In the morning Leta would draw a new triangle on the map and call it stupid for being necessary and then make it brilliant because she forgave it for being obvious.\n\nThe lantern in the alley did not go out. It made, very quietly, a noise that meant it was proud of being stubborn and did not need an audience to justify its life. The old radio said up under its breath and then, because it had practiced, together in a different vowel than yesterday, and the silence that had wanted to be polite and eat them politely for their own good paused with its spoon halfway to its mouth and listened, which was not nothing, which was not a win, which was nevertheless a place to put your foot if you intended to climb.In the kind of morning that wears its chill like a borrowed jacket, they went back to the throat with pockets full of small defiance. Pax carried a bundle of charcoal wrapped in wax paper and the clean arrogance of a boy who believes in drawings. Leta had a roll of tape so strong you could build a bridge out of it if the bridge agreed to behave, and she tucked a stubby grease pencil behind her ear like a mischievous thought. Ilyria took nothing but her bones and the coat that remembered when it was plumage, and if she was more careful with the stairs than yesterday, only the cat would have noticed. The wind at the seawall had discovered yesterday it could be persuaded and came along out of nosiness, flicking salt into their hair as if to sign its name.\n\nThe tunnel received them like someone who loves you and refuses to admit it. Blue ceramic made their footsteps into a suggestion rather than a fact, and the old signs with their hand-drawn arrows told stories about floods and buckets and men with rope that had once been cubes of hemp and now were plastic eager to be forgiven for being itself. Pax stopped at each intersection and made a tiny mark where only the dust would care, triangles so small that you would need a particular kind of curiosity to see them. He hummed under his breath because humming makes maps listen, and when they came at last to the chamber with the column it felt less like a discovery and more like arriving at a friend\u2019s kitchen without warning.\n\nThey drew on the emptiness the way you draw on glass and call it faith. Pax scrawled a fat together on the column\u2019s invisible skin with the seriousness of a child writing their name for the first time and hoping the world will call them by it. Leta sketched a looped figure-eight sideways because a symbol that had learned to lie about forever deserved to be taught humility, and she tucked a knot into the line that only she understood how to undo. Ilyria put her palm an inch from the tuned air and traced the long body of a breath, the way a dancer will outline the floor with their foot before they trust it, and the emptiness made a sound that wasn\u2019t a sound and accepted the attention as if attention were a wrench applied politely. None of it made a mark a bureaucrat could catalogue. All of it left fingerprints that would be stubborn in places water could not visit.\n\nUp above, Orrin had a different assignment that had nothing to do with tunnels and everything to do with the parts of a city that go soft when you look away. He went into living rooms that smelled like onions and into corners that had learned to carry shoes and into kitchens where a Warden\u2019s helmet sat on a shelf like a third parent and told people in his dry, ridiculous voice to practice holding each other. He put a private with stitches to bed on a couch that had been a bed too many times and put a baby into the private\u2019s hands and then left the room before the young man realized that he would remember the weight of that small skull forever and that terror could be holy. He stopped a patrol at a crossing where maintenance forgot to paint a line and had them count with their teeth and their tongues until the dampening, testing for old habits, walked past without recognizing them. When he paused to drink water in a doorway and stared out at the people not counting because they did not know how, he saw the net of their small deliberations like threads in good light and let himself love them with no plan for escape.\n\nLeta spent the late morning making friends with alarms. The siren grid was a bored creature with a large vocabulary and no sense of humor; she fed it jokes until it started testing punchlines. The depot master let her in under the roof with the air of a man who has decided to become an accomplice one little betrayal at a time, and she strung a run of foil between two support beams so high even the wind would have to ask for a stepladder. \u201cWe\u2019ll make the grid need us when it thinks it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said, and nobody asked her to translate because the way her hands spoke to wires was translation enough. When the test tone came at noon wrapped in the politeness of a public service announcement and carrying with it an undertone as sharp as a hairline crack, she felt the change in her teeth and swore elaborately into her sleeve. The Concord had introduced a floor. They were going to start asking the city to never fall below a particular quiet as if quiet were a kind of hygiene.\n\nAurek found them with his cardigan biting his elbows and his hair struggling to convince his head of anything. He did not come with a guard or with a smile; he came with a small folder that had been folded once too many times and a look as if he had tried to decide which part of himself to disappoint and chosen all of them evenly. He told them he had a window in the Pylon because a maintenance request had been approved by people who myself is a chorus do not ask questions, and he could get them onto a mezzanine inside the room where the numbers were pressed into shape. He warned them with that precise Concord diction of his that the next patch had a name and therefore a life: Resonance Constraint, Version 2.4. It would teach the dampening to ride on anything that carried regularity, which is to say heartbeat and train schedule and sleeping with the window open, and he said it in the tone of a man asking forgiveness and not being ready to do the tender work after.\n\nThey went as if going were a gift they couldn\u2019t afford and bought anyway. The maintenance door was the polite kind of locked that only ever asks you to know which adjective to use, and Aurek said the right adjective into a panel that had been taught to enjoy flattery. Inside, the Pylon had the cold that buildings get not from temperature but from alignment; the floors made sense to a blueprint and offended the soft geometry of knees. The elevator licked its lips and ate them with a polite ding, and when it spit them back into the maintenance mezzanine the air vibrated with professionally sanctioned intention. Below, the room they had seen from the other side of glass wore its power without jewelry, wires and ducts and the quiet that follows orders.\n\nThe Shepherd wasn\u2019t a person until your eyes insisted it was. It was a cage made of soft light and hard decisions, an arrangement of plates and coils around a central volume that had nothing in it and everything passing through. It was the absence between a hand and a shoulder made into device. It was, if you were the sort of person who had loved cathedrals before people decided they were unfashionable, an organ without pipes\u2014wind without wood\u2014an altar to the idea that something invisible could be persuaded to do work. Ilyria felt the shape of it in her sternum and made the small sound she makes for truth she\u2019d prefer not to have. The wave had a throat, and the throat had learned to be proud.\n\nThere was a voice in the room, and it did not come from a human mouth. It rose under the hum of the equipment like steam under a lid, and it said ordinary bureaucratic things in a tone that had never fit human grief. It said baseline achieved and it said attenuation within acceptable parameters and it said noncompliance flagged for review. Underneath those phrases, sewn in as neatly as a hem, was another voice so old and so careful you could miss it if you had never slept with a song under your pillow and woken fighting for your name. The old voice did not speak words; it spoke arrangement. Ilyria knew it without wanting to. There was Choir in the room. Not a person. Not one of hers. But a bone from the shipwreck set into the prow of a different vessel and taught to pretend it had always belonged there.\n\nShe reached without reaching, because touch is consent whether or not anyone admits it, and the space around the Shepherd offered her its formal neutrality. Leta stood with her back against a panel as if she meant to hold it as a dance partner if things got ridiculous. Pax crawled into the shadow under the mezzanine rail where only he could go and peered through a comb of metal slats with eyes that had learned to count light. Orrin put one hand on the lever that would open the fire hatch and another on Ilyria\u2019s arm as if the two were related and he intended to choose later which to use.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t break it,\u201d Aurek said, not because he cared about the machine more than the city but because he had learned which objects acquire wives and ex-wives and mortgages and make their own grief when broken. \u201cDon\u2019t break it, and if you can\u2019t avoid breaking it, try to break it into predictable pieces. I can keep a door polite for two minutes and then my superiors will notice their teeth feel wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to break it,\u201d Ilyria said, and the relief on Leta\u2019s face was almost rude. \u201cI\u2019m going to teach it a word it doesn\u2019t like.\u201d She stepped forward until her coat felt the hum like an animal feels a fence and told her bones not to visit every room in the building at once. The joke she had used on the column wouldn\u2019t work here; this device had never laughed. The kindness she had used on the city would be swallowed and turned into an invoice. Pop would have to go to school.\n\nShe sang the smallest, dumbest slice of together she had, trimmed until it fit through a seam that had been made for screws and regulations, and then she gave it a hard noun to wear: consent. The remark raced around the room and came back to her like an insult someone had improved in the retelling. The Shepherd accepted the sound and tried very politely to classify it. It recognized up as a directional error; it recognized hold as a hardware call; together did not lodge anywhere useful. Consent stuck where nothing else had stuck, whether because the Choir bone under the hood had known the word once in a longer, braver context, or because the city had recently thought it so loudly the ductwork had learned to whisper it. The machine did not break. It paused.\n\nLeta saw the pause on a monitor that was supposed to report only respectable numbers and pinned it to the graph with a finger that would not be believed in a report. She said, conversationally, to the panel at her back that if anything in this room tried to ramp quietly she was going to tell it a joke it would never get out of its head, and the panel pretended to be furniture with such thoroughness even she was impressed. Pax took his stub of charcoal and drew a little door on the underside of the mezzanine in a place no one would think to clean, and he made sure the doorknob was too high for adults and room-height for children. Orrin said a number out loud in a cadence that ought to have belonged to parade and instead ended up belonging to kitchens and to women learning to carry pots on their heads.\n\nThe wave came to look at itself and found a new definition printed under its picture. It tried to attenuate and discovered a permission question it had never had to answer. It sought its baseline and learned that floors can be negotiated. The pause spread the way a thought spreads when someone says your name and you remember you are doing something louder than you meant to. The room made a sound that none of the dials had a place for. Aurek looked up from his clipboard the way a man looks up from his wedding band when it doesn\u2019t fit anymore.\n\nSecurity came when everything that wasn\u2019t an alarm had already spoken. They came not in riot but in choreography, because this was not a building that liked to admit it needed to hurry. Doors that had never noticed themselves slid open as if to confess they had hinges, and men and women who had been taught to enforce with words moved in with words braced for push. Aurek stepped into the lane of their motion the way a man steps into rain to see who will stop him, and for three and a half breaths his badges and his cardigan and his carefully loyal vowels kept the room civil. Leta cut a cable that connected nothing to anything and watched a monitor blink as if insulted, and she whispered into its face that sometimes lying to machines is ethics. Orrin pulled Ilyria back without making it look like rescue. Pax scuttled sideways like a clever insect and tucked the charcoal back into his pocket because he had plans for it later that did not involve men with plans.\n\nThey left through a maintenance throat that had not been designed for people with wings. Ilyria folded herself down to the size of an apology and let the air carry her along a corridor where no one had intended music to pass. Aurek stayed, which was his choice and his disaster. He looked at the men coming down the aisle with their hands ready to help and to arrest and measured, for the first honest time, the weight of his name written under a law. He pressed gently a button that had not been meant to be pressed gently and watched as the Shepherd, baffled by the new word in its mouth, chose not to sing for a breath. It would cost him later in rooms where breath was a currency hoarded by those who spoke for a living. He did it anyway.\n\nOut in the light that behaved itself because it had an audience, the city discovered it had acquired a new habit. The dampening tried its careful hand at the afternoon and found itself obliged to ask permission. It could still press at bones that had never been taught to be stubborn, but in kitchens and doorways and at tram stops and on scaffolds the thing that had been installed in vents and bells and heaters ran into a small word someone had drawn on the inside of the air. No one knew why it now had to wait. They only knew that sometimes, when their minds went white and their tongues went obedient and the world seemed to want them quiet for their own good, it paused for the length of a joke, and in that pause there was enough time to choose.\n\nThe Council argued into a version of agreement that left everyone itchy and alive. The chairwoman of communications introduced a phrase with her careful mouth and the Council adopted it because names are how people feel like they act: Consent Protocol. It sounded stiff and official and entirely unlike the raw silly joy Ilyria had pushed into the pipes, and that was fine, because stiff and official would be the coat this thing wore to walk into rooms that hate singing. The ringed woman offered to shove the word into bylaws, and the man in collar-suit discovered that a corridor could be drawn on a map between laws and practices and that he, too, could be a cartographer if pressed. The new-book one wrote in the margin of their own notes not a quote and not a judgment and then looked up and smiled like a person watching a river decide not to drown a cow.\n\nLeta made of the hum a thing the backline could teach without sounding like church. She recorded six seconds of women laughing while folding towels and stuttered it so it sounded like stair-climbing, and she dialed the depot\u2019s rails until they carried the pattern without asking if it was respectable. She pinned the schedule to the wall and then wrote on top of it a list of six mistakes she wanted to make tomorrow in case the first six were too polite. The cat batted at a piece of coil fallen from Orrin\u2019s pocket and the coil tinked and the cat pretended to be ashamed, which fooled no one.\n\nMarrowdale did not relapse. He did not become a miracle either. He stood at a corner where the dampening had been thickest and he did not forget his name. When a woman with a bag of oranges dropped one into the street and flinched because she expected the old surprise inside her bones, he bent and picked it up and handed it back and said, \u201cUp,\u201d like he was trying the word on for flavor. She said, \u201cTogether,\u201d like she and the orange had agreed on a plan to ripen out of spite. He looked toward the sea and saw the Wardens on the wall, and they did not look like parade. They looked like men and women standing very still for a particular reason that was not obedience.\n\nAt dusk Aurek sent a message that had no official letterhead and no apology, and it arrived in a boy\u2019s pocket because boys\u2019 pockets are the safest couriers in a city. It said, in a hand that had learned to be neat for other people and careless only when no one would be grading, that he could keep one door slow for the thickness of an evening and that afterward the grid would teach itself a new trick he did not want it to learn. It said he would be cited for an error in procedure and that would be, for now, sufficient theater for both sides. It said, finally, in small letters to make the truth smaller, that if they intended to write on the throat again they should bring something that wouldn\u2019t wash.\n\nThey went at night because some words are shy and some are dangerous and some are both. Pax took a piece of chalk wrapped in cloth and a little bottle of glue he had stolen from a school drawer and an idea he would forget to explain later properly. Leta brought a single bell sewn into a handkerchief because bells know more about permission than most people, and she liked the way the sound would snag on corners. Orrin walked ahead and below and behind as if those were all reasonable positions for one man and not skills people admired. Ilyria carried the big silly song folded very small and tied with string.\n\nThe throat was awake. The column made the sound trees make when wind remembers their names. The coils muttered among themselves like men at a bar who have talked themselves into a fight and will now need to be talked out of it without losing face. Pax uncapped the glue and drew a ring around the charcoal word they had written this morning, a ring not quite circular, thrown by a child\u2019s wrist and therefore unruly in the correct way. He pressed grit into the glue and blew across it to cloud the air, and he looked at Ilyria and said, practical as countertops, that water can scrub but it cannot scold sand into forgetting.\n\nIlyria let the coat slip. She sang not into the machine but toward the part of it that had learned to hold breath as if it were currency. She gave it the bright weightless thing that had begun to belong to the city and pressed, not hard, exactly, but insistently, like rain that has decided to be your aunt. Consent did not become law. It became splinters inside a law that pretends to feel no pain. The room above them with glass walls sniffed and harrumphed and made notes. The wave retreated a finger\u2019s width from the edge of places where babies slept and men drank to survive being useful. The coils complained. The column learned a second new word and did not die of it.\n\nThey went back to the street with chalk on their hands and sand on their cuffs and the feeling you get when you have arranged a little mischief and the rest is going to be math. The old radio, which had been practicing humility for a week, said together like it had learned to do it on purpose rather than as an accident of vowels, and Pax clapped twice because sometimes applause needs no audience. Leta leaned against the studio door and had the thought\u2014brief and treacherous\u2014that she could leave the city one day and it would not fall apart because it had learned to argue with itself kindly. She dismissed the thought as vanity and wrote it down so she wouldn\u2019t forget to confess it later to the tea-grandmother, who would laugh and say that vanity is a tool like any other and some days the only one in reach.\n\nOrrin sat with his back to the shelf and let the quiet try to convince him he had done enough for one life. He watched Ilyria shake and not hide it, and he let his hand be the kind that holds a shoulder without claiming to be the reason a shoulder keeps working. He asked her, in the smallest voice a large man can make without sounding ridiculous, whether the cost was coming due sooner than she had promised. She told him no and yes and that she could show him how to carry a corner of it without being asked to eat the whole stone. He nodded like a man agreeing to carry his end of a table at a wake and not drop it.\n\nLater, when the city had rolled itself onto its good side and the lantern in the alley had proven, once again, that cheap light is stubborn light, Ilyria stood at the window and watched the cranes make astronomy with their arms. The coat hung on a nail and remembered a sky nobody else remembered on purpose. The big song sat in her chest with its knees up, waiting for the day it would be asked to come out and embarrass serious men. She thought of the Choir not as marble but as bodies that had once stood too close to each other in small rooms and argued over whether joy was strategy or indulgence until strategy grew jealous and left. She promised the city\u2014quietly, because promises spoken too loudly go deaf\u2014that she would not sell it a miracle that could be turned into a membrane and stretched across another city\u2019s mouth.\n\nUnder the seawall the column kept its ring of grit and learned to be petty. It refused, in tiny, important instances, to carry what it was asked to carry without hearing a fool\u2019s chorus first. It developed, to the bafflement of men in cardigans staring at displays, a weather of its own. In a week a maintenance man would go down with a cloth and a directive and would come up with sand on his lips and a song he couldn\u2019t stop humming and no idea where he had learned it. In a month Pax would be taller by a grudging inch and would claim it was the chalk. Tonight, the old radio said a sentence no one had taught it, halting and shy and inadequate and perfect in that inadequacy. It said, \u201cUp together hold,\u201d and the silence, which had never learned to laugh, did not swallow it, not because it had become polite but because it was busy listening for the next part.Morning put its ear to the city and pretended not to be eavesdropping. Trucks made low confessions to curbs, birds held union meetings on cables and forgot the agenda, and the Harbour sent a memo in salt that read, in essence, keep breathing. Ilyria woke with grit at the edges of her eyes that was not sleep, or not only, and when she coughed she tasted the sand they had pressed into the throat like an argument against washing. Leta was already at the desk translating stubbornness into logistics, her shoulders carrying the posture of a person who has decided to spend patience like cash, and Orrin was a square of stillness near the window with his hands around a cup that had learned to be warm exactly where fingers asked it.\n\nThe backline, which had become a creature with moods, growled a warning the way old dogs do when the weather feels wrong to their joints. Leta put a hand to the panel and listened with three fingers and a cheekbone, and she said, without taking her ear off the hum, that the Concord had rolled out their Resonance Constraint. She did not say it like a woman reporting a disaster; she said it like a mechanic presented with a new variety of squeak. In the rails and the tram cables and the veins of metal under streets, a tidy regularity began to insist on itself, small and smug and convinced that anything that matched it deserved to be lower. To a machine, the city ought to be quiet furniture. To a city, a machine that thought so needed to be taught embarrassment.\n\n\u201cWhat does it ride,\u201d Orrin asked, because he did not trust anything that used words like constraint to describe manners. Leta indicated with a grimace the loop that trains and heartbeats shared. The patch was looking for rhythms it could wear like a suit; it would take a pulse and drape itself across it and then persuade the wearer that the suit could not be removed. \u201cThen we make terrible tailors,\u201d she said, and the relief she took in her own phrasing was so brief it did not have time to sit down. \u201cWe trip the counts. We make the trains sigh between notes. We teach the city to stumble on purpose without falling.\u201d\n\nIlyria sat with her hands under her thighs to keep them from rehearsing a song before it was needed. The word consent sat quietly near her collarbone like a patient bee. In the midwatches of the night she had dreamed of the Choir sitting on the floor of a room too clean for human use, passing a cup that contained nothing but breath and deciding, one by one, whether to drink. She had woken with a sentence stuck between her ribs: consent is a hinge, not a door. The Shepherd had swallowed the word and choked once; that would not be enough. They would have to make hinges everywhere so that even if the Concord tried to nail things open or shut it would be nails against joints, not nails through bone.\n\nPax bounced in with a new height that he denied out of principle and a roll of paper that had once been a butcher\u2019s generous offering and now wore a fresh map. He had marked the places where people had begun to draw circles of grit around their windowsills and doorstep tiles, and he had pasted a feather to the paper at Spindle Yard because the turbines had decided to make a point about ownership. He tapped a corner where he\u2019d drawn a rectangle with teeth. \u201cClockhouse,\u201d he said, with the relish of a boy allowed to name a thing. \u201cIt\u2019s the only tower that still wants to tell time even when nobody\u2019s asking. The patch likes it. It hums at it like a person humming through their teeth when they don\u2019t want to admit to a tune.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Clockhouse hums back,\u201d Leta said, approving of any building that practiced rudeness as defense. She glanced at Ilyria, and the look carried math. There were only so many seconds a Bright could spend before the bill came due. Today would ask for some seconds, but not the big stupid beautiful ones; today wanted thread and needle and the kind of song that keeps a hand from shaking while you thread it.\n\nThey divided the mischief. Orrin took the blades dressed as men to the places where steps meet thresholds and taught a drill he called the Stumble, which made officers laugh until they tried it and discovered that stupid has teeth. The Stumble set a foot down not-quite wrong, then corrected like a dancer feigning ignorance in order to make grace visible. The dampening, sniffing for regularity, fell into the false step and lost its breath, and in that little gap a person could choose the next move rather than taking the one a device had made look inevitable. He made the dead count wrong with their tongues and make it right with their shoulders, and if the Concord had sent anyone to measure, the number on the clipboard would have been meaningless.\n\nLeta went to the Clockhouse with a bag that contained less than anyone thought and more than anyone knew how to ask for. The tower had a spiral staircase that wanted to be kissed and bit ankles instead; it creaked like a marriage and leaned like an argument and smelled like oil and salt made ceremonial by time. The clock itself had a face that believed in symmetry and hands that had learned forgiveness. She opened the little panel that only custodians and romantics open and found wires that had been taught to hum at the Concord\u2019s pitch. She did not cut them. She taped a bell to the plate where the hum entered and tied the bell to a cord that led to an open window and hung a handkerchief on the cord like a flag for very small states. Every time the grid tried to lay a blanket over the Clockhouse\u2019s insistence, the bell tsked, the handkerchief flicked, and the wind\u2014delighted to be invited to optics\u2014made a mess of the signal.\n\nIlyria went to places where nobody votes for anything. She walked into backrooms and stairwells and laundries and the narrow space behind ovens. She asked the women who measured lives in folded shirts and cut vegetables to add a syllable under their breath when their hearts tried to be polite in the way taught to them by fear. She stood in a doorway while a grandmother poured tea into a cup so fine it forgot it wanted to break, and she sang two notes so poor that a snob would have called them charity, and she left and the room kept the notes like someone keeps a nail in the wall after they move the photograph. She did not blame the men who waited to be told what kind of noise was required. They would learn faster once they saw what gravity did to them when they called it by a joke and watched it blush.\n\nAt noon, Aurek appeared by the fishmonger with a lemon in one hand and the look of a man who had realized policy is not weather when you\u2019re standing in it without a coat. He had lost some politeness from his vowels and gained a few from his eyes. He did not attempt persuasion; he asked for a corner of their shade. \u201cThey pushed the floor,\u201d he said without introductions, and his voice made a shelf out of resignation. \u201cThey will say it prevents panic and they will believe themselves. The Shepherd is asking permission more often and the reports are writing themselves around that like grass around a chair left too long in the yard. I have been cited for creativity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get demoted to free time if you\u2019re not careful,\u201d Leta said, and watched his face learn not to smile at the wrong moment. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching irregularity,\u201d she added, not to gloat but to see if the word would purse his superiors\u2019 mouths when he said it later in a room with glass walls. \u201cWe\u2019re giving the city excuses to ignore rhythm when rhythm isn\u2019t the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Aurek said, and he meant it in the helpless way that suggests knowledge that cannot yet perform. He held up the lemon as if to show he understood the day\u2019s austerity. \u201cThere is a meeting tonight, not here, not in any of your rooms. It is all cardigans and numbers and the occasional ring. If you want a mouth inside the room that will open the wrong question for you, I can be that mouth once. Not twice.\u201d He looked at Orrin as if apologizing for the limitation would improve it. \u201cThey\u2019ll put the Choir word properly into the metal if they can get a clean copy. Don\u2019t give them a clean copy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think we were going to sing into your tape deck,\u201d Ilyria said. Her smile was tired and intended to be. \u201cWe\u2019ll give them jokes with the medicine baked in. If they scrape the joke off and lick the frosting, they\u2019ll get nothing for their trouble except a sweet tooth and a new cavity.\u201d She took the lemon out of his hand and bit the rind, and the way her mouth worked told Leta and Orrin exactly how much she disliked the day and intended to do it anyway.\n\nThe city held. It did not triumph; it occupied its own rooms. People began to paint little dumb symbols in the corners of their lives, chalk loops on baseboards where toddlers would find them and ask whether circles can be doors, and strings tied around doorknobs not because anyone believed in string but because hands remember knots and knots remember hands. The dampening found less purchase on hearts that had been taught to stumble and laugh. Trains sighed between stops and passengers smiled at each other like conspirators and counted their own steps onto and off the carriages because counting, domesticated, had decided to be on their side.\n\nAfternoon leaned into the room where the plan lives and asked to be consulted. Leta drew a diagram she refused to call a plan because plans like to get offended and collapse dramatically when not obeyed. She placed three dots at the Clockhouse, Spindle Yard, and the throat under the seawall and made a crooked triangle that would insult geometry if geometry had feelings. \u201cWe call it a quaver,\u201d she said, and Pax snorted because musicians like to give names that are jokes when the world needs another word for almost. \u201cWe pull here and here and we don\u2019t pull here,\u201d she added, tapping each point, and the cat lifted its head and blinked as if to ask whether the pull included supper.\n\nOrrin put pegs into a street map with the tenderness of a carpenter. He made those pegs represent people, which is always a decision that costs afterward, and then he arranged the pegs so that nobody would be alone at the end of any street. The Wardens had learned to hum under their breath without being asked; the new ones had learned to forgive themselves for smiling during drills. He sent a boy with a stitched collar to a corner that had never belonged to any army and told him to stand there for an hour and listen to children shout the numbers wrong on purpose, and he did it because discipline that refuses to be curious becomes cruelty, and he was not that man.\n\nTwilight took the city and sat it down gently. Windows traded reports, and gulls rehearsed their opinions of eels. The Council of Breath did something quiet and therefore impressive: they did not summon anyone to a room; they went to their own windows and they tapped their own sills and they allowed their mouths to be wrong for a minute on purpose. It would not make a speech; it would make a memory. The chairwoman who had once ironed her schedules folded her hands and looked at them until they stopped telling her lies about control. The ringed woman took off one ring and set it beside the sink and discovered her fingers were still hands. The new-book one wrote nothing and listened, which is the bravest thing a person with a pen can do.\n\nNight\u2019s first depth arrived with an announcement dressed as weather. The Concord\u2019s grid sang flood and the city looked at the sea and did not see flood, and this is the sort of cognitive dissonance that can make people obedient or rebellious depending on whether they\u2019ve eaten. Leta\u2019s bell on the Clockhouse scolded like an aunt teaching a nephew the difference between honesty and performance. The Shepherd under the Pylon took a long breath to push the floor up, to make quiet the ethical default, and stopped a half second longer than anyone had a right to expect. Consent is a hinge. Hinges squeak when they\u2019re new.\n\nThey did not unroll the silly song. They did not ask the city to be chorus when the city needed to be furniture with a secret. Ilyria went to the throat again with Pax and the jar of sand and the knowledge that a body\u2019s limits are not suggestions but borders you can turn into flags. She traced the ring with a fingertip until the grit bit her skin, and then she whispered the not-song that tells machines about generosity and makes them confused enough to ask someone else for a definition. Pax stuck his head into the column\u2019s breath and told it, with absolute gravity, a joke about a door that was not a door because it was ajar, and the air, affronted into complicity, rolled the consonants around until they caught on the coils and turned into knots.\n\nOrrin stood in a doorway in Marrowdale that had never before felt protected unless a man with a gun stood in it. He had no gun; he had a count. He put his hand on the frame and his shoulder against the air and watched the dampening smell for a place to lie down. When it found none easy, it decided to get clever and went for the heartbeat of the woman at the sink. He said a number that was nonsense and then another that was almost real, and the woman wiped her hands and laughed and ruined the patch\u2019s appetite for long enough to finish washing an orange that would, for complicated reasons, save her in a small way later.\n\nAurek opened his mouth in the room where cardigans negotiate with teeth and said a sentence that made the temperature move. He asked whether anyone could show him a model in which consent did not reduce compliance but improved outcomes, and somebody made noise about ethics and somebody else said something about friction, and he said, delicately and with the recklessness of a man tired of being gentle with lies, that if they built a system that could not work when someone said no, perhaps the problem was not the no but the system. He did not get thrown out. He got lonelier, which is how reformers are punished in places that like to pretend themselves civilized.\n\nMidnight tilted and put the city on a new angle. There is a moment when sleep has not begun and the day refuses to admit it is dead where everything important slips because nobody is holding the top of the box. The dampening liked that moment. It likes unowned time. It slid along the roof gutters and into the sleeping apartments and found lungs practicing trust. At the Clockhouse, the bell flicked the handkerchief and the handkerchief told the wind, and the wind\u2019s laugh was enough to disturb the tidy layer the Concord wished to lay. In the tunnels, Pax snuck a second loop of sand where nobody had asked and then declared himself innocent to the air, which is not a court with jurisdiction but does approve of audacity. In the Pylon, the Shepherd\u2019s Choir-bone remembered for an instant the sound of a thousand throats refusing to agree about anything except beauty, and in that instant it forgot what floor it had been told to enforce.\n\nThey made the city go wrong together in small, disciplined ways. They walked off-beat on sidewalks, two steps and a stumble, two steps and a hitch, and the wave attempting to ride their cadence like a horse discovered it had bought a goat. They put little bells where nobody could scold them for a noise complaint because the bells were sewn inside jackets and tied under tables, and whenever the grid tried to take the breath out of a room, the metal answered with a civility that sounded like a threat. They miscounted to children and let the children correct them, which embedded in those small faces the intoxication of catching adults out and therefore made future obedience less certain. They refused, when they could, to do anything on the beat.\n\nWhen dawn arrived indecently early as a favor to no one, the city had not won and had not lost. It had reached the end of a day that wanted to count toward something and been counted by the right hands. Ilyria slept between insistences with her face turned toward a window that had learned to be a stage, and when the hook in her mind came to sit on the sill, she told it to wait until breakfast and it did, which only confirms that we misunderstand our enemies when we deny them grace. Leta stitched the bell into a new piece of cloth and wrote under it in pencil, for future thieves, don\u2019t steal this, borrow it loudly. Orrin put his head against a wall so the wall could learn his pulse and the wall, which had learned to be insulted by fewer things, decided not to take advantage.\n\nThey could not be everywhere. In a hallway in a clinic with tiles that remembered every footstep, a nurse with two pins in her hair and a secret romance with a tram inspector stood still and felt the floor wanting to introduce her to a hush she had not asked for. She looked up and saw a scratch of charcoal on the lintel, a triangle made by a boy with pockets full of maps, and she breathed and counted wrong and the hush left with poor manners. In an apartment where the radio had nothing useful to say, an old man who had never sung even drunk remembered that laughter counts and coughed in time to a joke he had been told at a bar, and the wave moved around him the way rain moves around awnings in a storm not quite committed to being disaster.\n\nA letter came from someone calling herself Carrel who wrote in a hand like a bird convinced of grammar. It said, Bright, you do not know me, but once, before we were frost and perfume in the mouths of institutions, I sang three floors up from where you stood yesterday and said a line I did not understand about the ownership of breath. They have taken our ash and made it into chalk and written on machines with it. If you wish to stop them you will have to be crude in a way the Choir taught you not to be. Break a scale. It will not be the first time music has been shrapnel. I will be in the Yard when the cranes make questions of the sky. Please bring a dumb song and no doctrine. The signature was a little sarcasm in ink, and below it a postscript: tell the boy to stop eating glue.\n\nThey met Carrel in the shadow of a turbine that had gotten vain. She was older than regret and younger than bitterness and wore a coat that had been stitched by hands that liked her more than she liked herself. When she smiled, you could see the place where beauty had been taken from her for parts and how she had reclaimed what she could by being interesting instead. She kissed Ilyria on both cheeks like a relative and then on the forehead like a nun and then stepped back as if she\u2019d bitten a lemon and found it fine. \u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d she said, which was not praise. \u201cYou are also obedient in some places it will not survive. We will have to wreck a thing and pretend it was inevitable.\u201d\n\nLeta held out her hands like a surgeon and Carrel laughed, not because it was funny but because it is too easy to love competence without asking it what it loves in return. \u201cThe Concord thinks rhythm is ethics,\u201d Carrel said, walking her fingers along the length of the turbine like a pianist letting a keyboard feel wanted. \u201cWe show them rhythm is politics. We will pull the measure until it refuses to square. We will write a seven against their four and make them count to it with their teeth.\u201d She spoke the numbers in a cadence that was not beautiful and therefore better, and Pax in the dirt mimicked her with a tapping that made the air shrug.\n\nThe plan, if forced to admit itself as a plan, was to make a moment so crooked that the Shepherd could not find a floor. They would set a counter-rhythm across the triangle\u2014the Clockhouse bell, the Yard\u2019s vanities, the throat\u2019s stubborn hinge\u2014and run a pattern through it that the Concord could not compress into a graph. People would do simple silly things on a schedule too odd to feel organized: clap on seven, breathe on three, lift a bag on five, look at the sky on one. Orrin scowled at the numbers because they insulted his feet, and then he practiced them until his shoulders learned them, because that is what you do when you were raised by drill and saved by jokes.\n\nThey warned the Council and received from it a blessing dressed as plausible deniability. The ringed woman sent a note that said, in code that was not code, if anyone asks whether we authorized insurgent choreography, tell them the minutes reflect a robust discussion of maritime insurance. The chairwoman delivered six posters with the word Windows printed in a font that had no business being interesting and a list underneath of reasons to open them at odd hours. The new-book one chewed a pencil down to its stubborn stub and wrote, just for them, not for the record, if we survive this we must codify silliness as a civic right.\n\nAt sundown they took their places. The Clockhouse glared at the sea with the superiority of things that pretend to tell time. The turbines coaxed a breeze into spinning faster by flattering it into speed. The throat under the seawall accepted its job as hinge with the petulance of a door that would rather be an arch. Leta tuned the backline to spray gossip in a sequence only a grandmother would think dignified and that is why it worked. Orrin set his people not where the hitting would be but where the touching would need to be supervised, which is a more difficult map. Pax ran along edges and drew triangles where he found them absent, because absence is an invitation.\n\nThe city lifted its chin. Carrel raised her fingers and bent them not like a conductor but like a child threatening a cat with a feather and demanding play. The first beat was a mistake on purpose. The second was a refusal. The third was a held breath. The fourth was laughter because somebody had waited wrong and discovered that wrong was acceptable. On seven, windows opened and people leaned out with hands that did not know what they had agreed to. On three, bags lifted and set down and lifted again until the dampening, confused about whether to call it work or dance, went looking for simpler prey. The Shepherd reached for floor and got a rug pulled. The resonance patch tried to ride heartbeats and found heartbeats counting nonsense with a confidence that made nonsense look like the truth.\n\nIlyria did not sing in the way that spends her. She let the word consent run along the rails, not as a sermon but as a question repeated until someone answered by accident. She tucked the silly into corners where the wave had grown proud. She let Carrel\u2019s crooked count speak first and followed it with a thread of melody so plain it embarrassed itself and thereby escaped being weaponized. She thought of the Choir in its pretty rooms and she said out loud, in front of God and the Council and the gulls and the Concord, forgive me for being uglier than you taught me, and she meant it and did not regret it.\n\nThe wave broke in places it had never broken because it had not believed that consent could be arranged in irregular shapes. It recoiled from thresholds and sulked in ducts and went to ground in clocks, and the bell bullied it. People laughed in ways that made them cough and then breathe, and coughing counts when the alternative is decorous suffocation. A boy on a bicycle counted seven so hard he almost fell and did not, and the woman with the oranges tossed one to the man who had nearly punched someone and he caught it and declared the fruit an ally, which it was.\n\nAurek, in a room with glass walls, listened to numbers misbehave and discovered pleasure and fear occupy the same physical space when you have not taught them how to share. He saw the pause on a display where nothing on paper would admit to a pause, and he did not clap because men like him are not taught where to put their hands when the right thing happens. He thought of being fired and of having to explain at holidays that he had tried to count consent and the counting had counted back, and he thought that perhaps there was a room in the city where he could practice not being on the wrong side of the arithmetic.\n\nWhen it passed, it did not announce itself with sirens or policy. It simply left. The dampening took its discipline and went to sharpen its pencils. The Shepherd held its breath like a child promised a sweet and given a sermon. The turbines settled into honest work. The Clockhouse, offended by excitement, claimed not to have enjoyed itself. People closed their windows and put pots on stoves and discovered that they were able to finish small tasks without being told they were selfish for doing so.\n\nThey would not be allowed to keep this peace, not the largeness of it. But they could keep the habits. They could keep the triangle of wrongness and redraw it in chalk whenever the rain admitted to being a collaborator. They could keep bells in handkerchiefs and the practice of asking whether a floor is a suggestion rather than a rule. They could teach the children to laugh off-beat and to forgive adults for being clumsy in the right battles. They could sit down and shake and not hide it.\n\nIlyria shook. Orrin put his arm around her without claiming ownership of the arm or the person. Leta leaned her head against the panel that had dignified the day by behaving and said under her breath that she had run out of clever and would need to go to the store. Pax climbed a stair and went back down and then went up again because that is what you do when your bones have learned a new direction. Carrel stood with her hands in her pockets and looked at the sky and apologized to no one for still wanting magnificence even on days when survival was a better project.\n\nWhen the tea-grandmother arrived, she did it without hurry and brought an onion tart and explained how to make onions speak the truth about sugar by taking too long and pretending you are not impatient. She kissed Leta on the forehead because Leta deserved to be thanked for choosing the right mistakes, and she told Orrin that dignity looks better with scuffed boots, and she told Pax that glue is not for eating unless your aunt is present and says it is a holiday. To Ilyria she said nothing for a minute and then, like someone setting down a key on a table between two women who are not yet ready to admit they live in the same house, she said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the song that saves us. It\u2019s the insistence on singing while we cook.\u201d\n\nBefore sleep, which had earned its rest, a message slid in under the door of the studio in the form of a boy who did not remember having been asked to deliver it. It was a square of paper with an ugly staple, and on it someone had typed: next escalation: totalized lull, duration 72 hours, justified as civic calm during resource rotation. The device will refuse disorder as a category. Prepare chaos or law. It was unsigned and smelled faintly of lemon. Leta pinned it to the map where only the cat could read it and the cat, trained in suffering, decided it would sit on the warning for the evening and make it warmer.\n\nIlyria lay down and could not find the border between her body and the day. She counted backward from an unreasonable number and lost her place and did not mind. She thought of the hinge and the door and the hand that presses and of the quiet she would have to make into an accomplice if the Concord punished them by being nice. She told her bones to learn slowness the way they had learned speed, and they sulked and promised to consider it in the morning. The old radio, ambitious for language, said, \u201cHold consent up,\u201d and then, shy, tried the words in a different order. It did not matter which way they sat. It mattered that they had crossed a room that had once been empty and now contained chairs.",

                              "content": "The first time Ilyria saw the seawall, a procession of armored dead were climbing it in perfect silence. Their boots clinked like glass tapping a rim, a tiny toast repeated and repeated until it became a rhythm. The air smelled of salt and engine grease and the rain that did not fall, suspended like a rumor at the edge of the clouds. The wall itself was poured concrete and old poems, recent paint scrolled over chipped slogans, the names of those who promised never to die and then kept the promise, in their way. A gull spiraled close enough to be a handkerchief and then flicked away, as if embarrassed by the attention. On the far side, the sea made a careful, grinding sound, like something sharpening its teeth on the horizon.\n\nShe carried her wings as a coat. That was the trick the old choristers had taught her: not to hide, but to insinuate. The feathers obeyed the fiction\u2014a long, dull grey coat that draped to her calves and swayed of its own weather. It did not fit, and that made it fit. Everyone in Glass Harbor wore something that didn\u2019t quite belong to them.\n\n\u201cBright,\u201d said a voice, and a man with a stitched cheek and eyes the color of pressurized ice stopped beside her. He had a metal pin on his collar, a simple circle with a single stroke through it: Wardens Corps. The pin was polished to an unreasonable shine, as if the hand that polished it had made a vow. He didn\u2019t smell like rot, but like iron filings and sage tea. The dead here were well-kept. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to climb, don\u2019t. We\u2019ve enough falling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Ilyria said. The lie fluttered out; it had a sound like a moth. \u201cI was listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe\u2014\u201d She hesitated. From the top of the wall came a thrum, so low she could hardly hear it. It was under hearing, under her heart. The procession had reached the crest and was standing in a row, rifles slung, their faces turned toward the city as if people-watching. Below them, a kiosk sputtered neon, offering dumplings and fragments of antique music. \u201cThe pattern.\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, lifted his chin toward the Wardens. \u201cThey count their steps. It keeps them together. Same as us. The living don\u2019t make time; time hauls us like a cart. But a count, that\u2019s choice.\u201d\n\nShe looked at his hands. Under the ash-and-silver skin, muscle and tendon moved like something rehearsed. He was not what she had expected of a zombie. That word was impolite here, like a slur. They were Wardens; they were the fallen who signed their names a second time, who agreed to stand up again when the bell was rung. It wasn\u2019t necromancy. It was civic duty. Don\u2019t poke it too hard.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Orrin,\u201d he said. He let the name out with no ceremony, like spilling water just to see how it would fall.\n\n\u201cIlyria.\u201d\n\nHe nodded once. No commentary. That was another thing about the dead: they saved their breath for orders. \u201cIf you\u2019re listening for patterns, come on. I\u2019ve got a friend who tunes the city. She hears everything, even what isn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\nThey walked along the lower road, past stalls and stacks of crate-wood platforms and a boy with a kite made of aluminum foil who laughed like a leak in a pipe. Ilyria kept her hands in her coat pockets, so the feathers would remember to be still. The city\u2019s noises were a slow braided rope: bicycle bells, accordion wheeze, the click of relays switching somewhere a block away, someone clapping out a code at a window with the curtains drawn. Above all, the wind. The wind here had been made to work. It turned vanes and dragged flags and shook chimes and lifted the failed promises out of people\u2019s mouths so they could breathe again.\n\nOrrin turned into an alley with coppery murals rising out of the brick. They had been drawn by someone with a long brush and a high perch\u2014a ladder?\u2014and maybe the help of two or three accomplices who didn\u2019t mind paint on their shoes. The alley smelled like tangerines and welding. Halfway down, a paper lantern hung on a chain. It had been repaired with tape at least six times. The chain was thick enough to secure a submarine.\n\n\u201cLeta,\u201d Orrin called. He didn\u2019t say it loud. Saying anything loud in Glass Harbor was a way to invite arguments.\n\nA girl stuck her head out of a door with a noise like a trap easing off its tooth. She had short hair that had been dyed the color of a faded traffic cone and then grown out to reveal its natural black underneath. Headphones lounged around her neck like a cat that believed itself a scarf. \u201cWar-lord,\u201d she said. \u201cYou bring me a war?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust brightness.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Leta,\u201d Orrin said. \u201cShe broadcasts.\u201d\n\n\u201cIllicitly,\u201d Leta said politely. \u201cBecause legal would be dull.\u201d\n\nShe looked at Ilyria with interest and caution and a cleverness that pulled the corners of her mouth up when she wasn\u2019t thinking about it. Her eyes flicked down, found the wrongness of the coat, flicked up again and pretended to find nothing at all. \u201cWell, Bright. Come in, if you like rules. My rules, which are sturdier than the city\u2019s but have fewer officials.\u201d\n\nThe studio had been a storeroom once, and still remembered. Crates, boxes, catalog cards in a metal tray that shone with fingerprints. Between all that, the shrine of an industrious god: an old mixer with solder scars, a pair of ribbon mics like twin steel dragonflies, a squat transmitter, a rack of spools. The spools were labeled with handwriting, the kind that had begun as neat but then had grown anxious and took to blaming the pen.\n\n\u201cSit,\u201d Leta said, and scooped a cat off the only padded chair. The cat made a noise that suggested it had expected better. \u201cTea? I\u2019ve got a bag of something that smells like the inside of a library.\u201d\n\n\u201cTea,\u201d Ilyria said, because etiquette matters. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\nOrrin leaned against a shelf and did his best impression of an idle person. It wasn\u2019t bad. His idle was anyone else\u2019s alert. The healed seam on his cheek pulled slightly. She thought of thread and of water that had learned to be patient.\n\n\u201cSo,\u201d Leta said, between clinks and the soft ripping hurry of boiling water. \u201cYou\u2019re far from your cloud.\u201d\n\nIlyria smiled with her mouth and not her eyes. \u201cThe clouds are often farther than they look.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had rumors about your sort. Tall. Shiny. Throat full of thunder. Leans over balconies and points at things. The usual. But you don\u2019t look like a rumor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like one,\u201d Ilyria said. She could feel the other thing, though. The hum behind her ribs, the melody that had written its hook across the inside of her skull and then left the rest of the song off the page. It was pop, the way a heartbeat is pop: simple, ruthless, relentless, honest. The Choir had hated this kind of thing. They had said it was too easy, too obvious. They had said it stole attention. They had said more things. They had stopped saying anything, one day, all together, like a door shutting thirteen doorways away.\n\nLeta settled the cups on a tray and pushed the tray through the knotted wires like it was a negotiation. \u201cThere\u2019s a new station,\u201d she said, as if that were small talk. \u201cShowed up three weeks ago. You know the way a song you don\u2019t even like will lodge in your teeth? This isn\u2019t like that. It\u2019s not even a song. It\u2019s like the suggestion of a song. The negative-space of a chorus. It\u2019s eating bands, Ilyria. I find gaps where there were tracks. People get quiet, after they hear it. Sometimes they forget what they were saying in the middle of a sentence and they never remember.\u201d\n\nOrrin rapped his knuckle lightly against the shelf. \u201cWe had three Wardens wander out of their perimeter, last night. When I touched them, their hands were like a refrigerator tray you forgot to defrost. And they were smiling. Not a real smile. The kind kids draw when they\u2019re trying to make a ghost less scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Concord calls it a dampening wave,\u201d Leta said. \u201cBecause the Concord likes to pretend we live in a world of mechanics, not magic. But with respect to the Concord, whatever it is, it tastes like a borrowed grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has a rhythm,\u201d Ilyria heard herself say, softly. The cups were warm in her hands. Heat, such an ordinary miracle. \u201cI can hear the math of it. Like footfalls.\u201d\n\nOrrin\u2019s eyes did whatever eyes do when their owner has already half-decided to hope. \u201cCan you hum it?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t, because something in her knew that to hum was to consent, to feed and be fed-upon. She had been told stories about the old wars, where melodies had been used as weapons, and not metaphorically, not at all. The way a sung pitch could lay a bridge of fire across a spine. The way a wrong harmony could make a heart forget its order.\n\n\u201cI could transform it,\u201d she said instead. It tasted like a lie, but it wasn\u2019t. Not exactly. \u201cBut I would need\u2026 it\u2019s not a studio matter.\u201d She gestured to the slab of recorder, the coiled cords. \u201cIt\u2019s my head. That\u2019s the stage.\u201d\n\nLeta looked at her for a long beat. \u201cDon\u2019t flirt. It wastes good tragedy. You mean you can broadcast without kit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean I can compose a message that will use me as its speaker. I can let it happen. And if I do, it will land where it needs to.\u201d\n\nOrrin\u2019s jaw tightened. His knuckles were still against the wood. \u201cAnd where is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the bones,\u201d Ilyria said. The cat, as if bored of theology, sprang to the desk and knocked a pencil to the floor. The pencil made a decision about whether to break and chose no. \u201cWhich is why I cannot do it casually. It\u2019s not a poem. It\u2019s more like weather.\u201d\n\nThe word hung in the room. Weather. The difference between a drizzle and a storm is not simply how wet you get. It is which memories of ships you carry afterward.\n\nLeta took a breath. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to test. Carefully. Tiny. Like microdose. I can give you a line. The backline. Nobody listens to the backline but the kind of nerds who read whitepapers for fun. No offense, Orrin.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone taken,\u201d he said. \u201cAll my papers were black on the front.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d also introduce you to the Council,\u201d Leta said to Ilyria. \u201cThey\u2019re prickly and petty and terrified. They\u2019ll want to cut you into committees, if you let them. But they pay in batteries and safe corridors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why would you do that?\u201d Ilyria asked her. \u201cIntroduce me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the city needs its chimera.\u201d Leta shrugged. \u201cBecause when the world refuses to make sense, I prefer to run at the most interesting nonsense with a slightly illegal antenna. Because you look like you\u2019ve been listening for longer than we\u2019ve been alive, and I\u2019m vain enough to think I could learn to listen like that.\u201d\n\nIlyria smiled, real this time. It surprised her mouth. She thought of the Choir and of their marble logic, their bloodless brilliance. She thought of how they had loved rules the way engineers love riverbanks\u2014not to stop the river, but to point it where it could sing. She thought of the silence that had fallen over all of them like a net. The day her messages received no replies, she had stood on a hill and sang their names until the birds came and sat on the wires to look at her. The birds had been very polite.\n\n\u201cShow me your backline,\u201d she said.\n\nLeta touched the transmitter with a gentle, proprietary hand. \u201cI\u2019ll show you mine if you show me yours. The mind, I mean. Your\u2014\u201d She flapped her fingers awkwardly near her temple. \u201cYour\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cHarmony,\u201d Ilyria supplied. \u201cIt\u2019s a little broken. But yes.\u201d\n\nThey spent that afternoon making a room smaller and bigger at once. Leta tuned and tuned again, narrowing channels, braiding them. She threaded cable above her head like wires between planets, connecting the imaginary constellations with real copper. Orrin came and went, as Wardens do, giving a report to a lieutenant with eyes like storm glass and returning with an extra coil of rope he insisted the studio would someday need. He carried things like he did not want to wake them.\n\nAt dusk, when the sky was a bruise with a gold thumbprint pressed in, they tried.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Leta said, and breath fogged her headphones. \u201cWe\u2019ll ride on channel twelve. Old city maps. I\u2019ve got the band filter smothered like I smothered my feelings at my cousin\u2019s wedding. You\u2019ll just\u2014think, or sing, or whatever. Keep it under two seconds. You hear me? Two. Seconds. Not two and a half. I put this sticker here to help.\u201d She slapped a sticker on the desk that said Two is a gas station hot dog. Believe in yourself.\n\nIlyria shut her eyes. Closing them did not make her more or less celestial; it only gave the world the courtesy of not looking at it while she did this.\n\nBehind her breastbone, the hum stirred. It had teeth. She had known that. She had known it since the day she woke to the quiet of the Choir and the whole sky had become only hers.\n\nShe opened her mouth and did not move her mouth. The sound rose in her head like breath on a cold morning meets a pane of glass. It had the shape of a chorus but none of the words, the way you can tell a stranger is telling a joke even if you do not speak their language. It was bright. She kept it dull. She held it down with a net of intention, with the thought of how the dark in the corners of the studio felt not scary but restful, with the weight of a cat on a keyboard, with the voice of Leta saying, two seconds, two\u2014\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d Leta hissed, and jabbed a button.\n\nIlyria let the brightness out and counted one, two. Stopped.\n\nThe sound had gone nowhere, everywhere. It was not sound, exactly. It was the suggestion of a place to put a sound. It was a hook without a fish. It was a chorus without a verse to wear it. Leta\u2019s eyes were wide; Orrin had one hand on the doorframe without remembering he had put it there.\n\nFor a moment, the city seemed to take a breath.\n\nThen the radio on the shelf\u2014an old portable with a cracked dial and a strip of copper tape holding its battery door shut\u2014hissed and slid and then keened very softly. The keen rose and fell. It matched Ilyria\u2019s last thought.\n\n\u201cIs that good?\u201d Orrin asked, as if he were asking a doctor if his arm was supposed to look like it had been drawn by a child.\n\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Leta said. \u201cOr maybe we just rang a bell nobody told us about. Keep it off. No more. You hear me?\u201d She was looking at Ilyria. \u201cWe don\u2019t press a big red button twice in the same day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t press anything,\u201d Ilyria said. She had to lick her lips to get the words to stop sticking. \u201cThe button pressed me.\u201d\n\nOrrin leaned out the door. \u201cYou two should hear something.\u201d His voice had that careful blankness he used when he was uncertain how much human to be. They followed him into the alley.\n\nThe evening market had a dozen songs at once, as always: litigators arguing about fish prices that had once been prices and were now curses, an aunt scolding her niece for loving someone appropriately, a saxophone complaining into a hat. Underneath that, under even the electric tone the wind-chimes made, there was a sub-music. A new figure in the braid.\n\nPeople were standing a little straighter. Not like soldiers. Like dancers, when the bass checks in and they know someone knows what they came here to do.\n\nOn the seawall, the Wardens lifted their heads, all together, as if smelling bread.\n\n\u201cSee?\u201d Leta whispered, and touched, without meaning to, the back of Ilyria\u2019s arm. It startled the feathers beneath the coat. \u201cWeather.\u201d\n\nThe test had a price. Isn\u2019t it always sometimes usually. Orrin came back late from his watch with a squared mouth, and there were four Wardens behind him, three upright and one in a chair made from aluminum tubing and bicycle tires. The one in the chair was moving his hands across the arms as if playing an invisible piano. His eyes were closed, and his lips moved. No sound came out.\n\n\u201cWhat did we do?\u201d Leta demanded, low and terrifying.\n\n\u201cIt was already happening,\u201d Orrin said. He kept his temper under ten layers of uniform. \u201cWe didn\u2019t make the fire. We just showed the smoke how to rise.\u201d He looked at Ilyria, then away. \u201cBut you nudged it.\u201d\n\nIlyria crouched in front of the Warden in the chair. He was young. Nineteen? He had died nineteen and chosen to remain nineteen until he\u2019d had enough of duty to deserve a number that meant something else. Someone had sewed a patch on his sleeve with quick, untidy stitches. It said MARROWDALE. He didn\u2019t have a name on his breast. New.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d she said, as if she were a friend and they had lost each other in a store and now the bread aisle was the place to be found. \u201cHey, can you hear me?\u201d She placed her hand lightly over his fingers where they played. The touch unspooled something in her. She heard, for the first time, the dampening wave not as absence but as a shape. It was the negative of a melody that had once been obvious and now had to be guessed at.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shadow,\u201d she said, out loud. \u201cIt\u2019s singing the places songs aren\u2019t. It\u2019s using the places we aren\u2019t looking.\u201d\n\nLeta swore softly. \u201cWe need more than a backline.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need to go up,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cThe choir loft.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe what.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe highest place that is not a peak. The place where the wind and the city find each other. You\u2019ll have one. All cities do. They access the hinge. I\u2014\u201d She swallowed. She did not do that often. \u201cThe signal\u2026 layer. It\u2019s not just radio. It\u2019s bones, Orrin. Don\u2019t make that face. It\u2019s not witchcraft. It\u2019s the physics of memory. A couple cathedrals figured it out and pretended they hadn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nLeta shoved a hand through her hair and it came away holding dust and a paperclip, which she threw like a small spear at a poster of a festival that had never happened. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got Drumhouse. Old amphitheater they turned into a court, then a dormitory, then a prison, then a skate park, then they forgot what it was and stopped asking. The wind goes there to eavesdrop. You think you can\u2014what was the word you used? Transform?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I can put a hook in where the shadow tries to hide,\u201d Ilyria said, and the boy in the chair moved his mouth around the shapes of a syllable. \u201cI can bait it with joy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds illegal,\u201d Leta said, reverent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take you,\u201d Orrin said. \u201cTonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight?\u201d Leta flinched, but not hard. She was brave enough to be afraid.\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d Orrin said again. \u201cIf it\u2019s a war, we don\u2019t let morning set the terms. Besides, the Council meets on Tuesdays. We don\u2019t need six secretaries editing our hopes.\u201d\n\nThey went.\n\nGlass Harbor at night was not a darker version of itself. It was a different animal. The markets folded their legs and closed their eyes, and in the spaces they left, other things wandered out: the wheel-men with their bright torches and hard shoes on soft gravel, the children who raced along painted lines on the pavement like prayers written across a map, the Wardens recommissioned as lullaby-makers who walked the quiet streets in pairs, practicing reassuring silence. On the rooftops, pipes hummed and mammoth fans rotated and offered the sky rose-colored measurements. The seawall did its impression of a dinosaur\u2019s back.\n\nDrumhouse sat on the hill like a bowl someone had made out of the idea of sound. Concrete curves lipped, tier upon tier upon tier, all the way down to a stage with its teeth knocked out by climate or decision-making. Someone had painted the steps with equations; someone had come along later and painted the equations into fish. A fence circled the top to keep logic from falling out.\n\nThey climbed. Prenatal wind tangled itself in Ilyria\u2019s hair and made promises. Orrin counted his steps; Leta swore at the tenth step and skipped the eleventh; Ilyria made no noise at all. On the third tier, a man slept with a coat over his face and a dog at his feet that dreamed irregularly. On the fifth, a couple argued softly into each other\u2019s hands, stopping occasionally to laugh, which should be required by law in arguments.\n\nOn the lip of the bowl, everything else was smaller. The harbor, the cranes stacking cargo into a skyline of brief apartments for things, the austere geometry of the main road where trams blinked their eyes like patient fish. And above, stars that wore the exactness of a lie.\n\n\u201cYou sure?\u201d Leta asked, hugging her cables. She had brought cables up a hill because that is what love looks like when it\u2019s practical.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth?\u201d Orrin said, and smiled carefully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s how angels pray.\u201d\n\nShe stepped to the place the wind went when it felt like telling secrets. The concrete had been eroded just enough. She put her hand against the air. She could feel the old songs here, the ones the city had hummed itself when it still believed in kings, the ones it had rapped into its own stones when money was a god who needed rhythm, the ones children had shrieked and the ones women had cried into the hems of their dresses and the ones a man missing three fingers had tapped into the railings at dawn just so he\u2019d have something to fight with later.\n\nShe closed her eyes.\n\nThe pop song was not an embarrassment. It was invention. The heart, faced with too much complexity, builds a safety stair out of repeated gestures. It learns to climb. The hook in her mind hooked her, sure, but it also offered her a way to pull back. It was not an enemy. It was a tool that didn\u2019t know it was a tool. It was like she had found a bird and learned it knew only one tune but would sing it both for fun and for safety. She had disliked pop because the Choir had disliked pop. The Choir had been wrong about other things. It turned out you could be divine and petty. Who knew.\n\n\u201cLeta,\u201d she said. \u201cOne second. Not two. If you close me too soon, it will echo. If you leave me too long, it will fist.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it what?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust listen, all right?\u201d\n\nShe breathed. There were seventeen different breezes composing themselves into a consensus around her. She let each of them rattle a different feather under the fiction of the coat. Her bones lengthened. That always happened when she destabilized her voice. She counted in an ancient meter that did not require numbers.\n\nIlyria let the chorus find her. It moved toward the dampening wave the way a magnet moves toward iron it has never met but was promised at birth. She dressed it bright. She gave it words\u2014it had no words, it needed words\u2014and the words were nothing at all and everything, the kind of words a child could remember and a soldier could believe and a dead man could call to mind when he was due to pick up his helmet. The words were these:\n\n\u201cUp and up, my heart, up and up.\u201d\n\nShe did not know, until she sang them, that they would be what she said. They were simple enough to be a lie and true enough to be a spell. She let them ring and held and stopped.\n\nGlass Harbor breathed again. The bowl took the sound she had not made and set it down in every ear as if it were a coin.\n\nOn the far side of the hill, sirens started their wolves and then stopped not because they had been told to stop but because they remembered other work. Two Wardens below them turned toward each other and tapped their knuckles together in a motion that was part greeting and part recording, and the young one of the two had his stitches pulled too tight and said, \u201cUp?\u201d\n\n\u201cUp,\u201d the older one said, trying the syllable on, as if it had to do with windows.\n\nLeta had tears in her eyes. She was not the sort of person songs organized. She organized songs; it was one of her many arrogances. But this had gone under her hands, under the desk she loved, under the thick coil of cable she slept with sometimes when the city barked too loud. \u201cYou made it. You made it pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made it loud,\u201d Ilyria said. She was shaky now. She would shake worse later. \u201cI made it like candy but for the part of a brain that learned to leave a room when the room grew smaller.\u201d\n\nOrrin\u2019s mouth had opened, about to say some generous thing. Before he did, the wind came back wrong, and the wrong was cold.\n\nIn the very low place, the place beneath the sea and under the beds of children and behind the curtain of ordinary fear, the dampening wave pushed. It pressed back, not because it disliked what she had done, but because pushing is what it was. Pressure made to be pressure. The shadow turned on itself, eddied, gathered. And somewhere below, in the city, a radio that had never worked hummed a note that made a flock of pigeons lift at once, startle, settle.\n\nOrrin\u2019s hand touched her arm. Just fingers. Hard to tell where the glove ended. \u201cIs it going to break?\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything breaks,\u201d Ilyria said. She felt the scattered strengths of her scattered bones. \u201cBut we can decide when to glue it.\u201d\n\nThey left the bowl and its hopeful echo and walked down with care. The wind followed as far as it dared. At the foot of the hill, a boy was waiting in a hoodie three sizes too big for him and shoes that had been someone else\u2019s with a different kind of foot. He had a backpack that squirmed as if it had caught a cricket.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d he said. He was eleven. The city made eleven-year-olds like factories made whistles. He had a voice that had learned not to say the wrong names. \u201cCouncil wants you. The Bright. Both of you. They said the dead are murmuring and we did not authorize murmurs.\u201d\n\nOrrin almost laughed. It was very small and it did not leave his throat. \u201cThey never do.\u201d\n\nLeta dropped a coil of cable into the backpack without asking if that was an acceptable thing to do. The backpack made a forgiving sound. \u201cPax? Is that you? Who let you carry messages at night?\u201d\n\n\u201cI let me,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t, they send a man with shoes that squeak and then everyone knows a message is coming and they hide in their stoves. Also my aunt said it was okay as long as I wasn\u2019t on the big roads and I listened to my intuition. My intuition says you smell like static.\u201d\n\n\u201cWise intuition,\u201d Ilyria said gently. \u201cWe\u2019ll come.\u201d\n\nThe Council of Breath met in a building shaped like a compromise. It had been declared both round and square by committee, and in settling the question, it had become a top hat someone melted and then sat on to see if it would fit. Inside were desks and flags and a very old plant that had never once given anyone a straight answer. A woman with rings on every finger except the one that announces and a man in a suit made from old suit collars and a third person who had a face like a new book you were afraid to crack gave them the kind of smiles people hand out when they are both grateful and irritated.\n\n\u201cWe heard your noise,\u201d the ringed woman said, without introduction.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a noise,\u201d Leta said. \u201cIt was a snack. For a void.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe appreciate snacks,\u201d the man in collar-suit said. He had the precise tone of a person who had come to appreciate a great many things in order to keep his job. \u201cBut we also like to know who fed whom. And with what. And whether anyone is going to get indigestion.\u201d\n\nOrrin stood still in the corner, and his stillness softened their voices the way a stack of quilts in a room makes people hush because they don\u2019t want to wake the dust.\n\n\u201cThe dampening wave is not random,\u201d Ilyria said. She was not supposed to reach conclusions yet. But the way parts of her were shaking made it easier to speak than to let silence become a second decision. \u201cIt\u2019s a feedback. And it\u2019s organized. It\u2019s being shepherded by someone who understands how bodies listen.\u201d\n\nThe Council members looked at one another. The new-book one said, \u201cAre you implying a mind. A mind that would do such a thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stating it,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cNot implying. I\u2019m implying other things I don\u2019t want to say yet.\u201d She glanced at Orrin. He understood more than he made a habit of admitting. \u201cYour Wardens are the most vulnerable. Their bones are tuned. The living forget certain pains, naturally, over time. The dead\u2026 some of you chose to be very exact.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d Orrin said, like a man who once volunteered and keeps volunteering. \u201cWe are.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think this shadow\u2014this wave\u2014wants to take our soldiers,\u201d the ringed woman said. \u201cFor what purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo unman a city,\u201d the man said softly, as if quoting his childhood.\n\n\u201cTo turn an army,\u201d the new-book one said. \u201cBecause an army that cannot feel its own signal will take a new one. Any one. The loudest. The simplest.\u201d\n\nLeta looked at Ilyria. The angle of her chin was terrible and beautiful. It said, I will hold you to your own suggestion. \u201cThen we make ours loud,\u201d she said. \u201cWe make it so catchy the bones sing it when they\u2019re busy growing. We make it the thing the shadow can\u2019t be, because it has no words, and because it uses subtraction instead of addition. We use stupid joy and we use it like scaffolding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d Ilyria said. Her mouth was dry now. The tea had been after all insufficient. \u201cI can\u2019t just sing through equipment. If I do that, the wave will swallow it like a river swallows a bridge built of the wrong metal. The metal I have is\u2026 this.\u201d She gestured to herself. Coil and cloak and all the old light the world had left her. \u201cI have no choice, when the time comes. I may have no breath afterwards. You asked to be briefed? That is the brief.\u201d\n\nThe Council considered the cost without touching it. No one cried. No one asked her not to. In the petty universe of committees, that counted as courage.\n\n\u201cWe will resource you,\u201d the ringed woman said briskly. \u201cWe will make corridors. We will put the word in every window that listens. You\u2019ll work with Communications Sub-committee and the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWith me,\u201d Leta said. \u201cShe\u2019ll work with me.\u201d She jutted her chin at the three. \u201cYou don\u2019t know timing. You know minutes. We need seconds. Two, to be exact.\u201d\n\nOrrin, who had not told them all the ways his dead had gone quiet, who had not confessed how the young one in the chair had smiled without a person behind it for a moment that lasted three long buses and a breath, said, \u201cAnd with me. We\u2019ll need to hold the perimeters. We\u2019ll need to hold each other. We can not have everything. But we can have that.\u201d\n\nAfterward, outside, the night had grown teeth but decided not to use them in front of guests. Pax, the boy messenger, put his hand on Ilyria\u2019s coat and said, \u201cYour coat is alive,\u201d and grinned like a moon trying out a scar.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes it forgets to be.\u201d She bent down and, because she could and because someone should, gave him the truth in a spoon. \u201cI will make a song. It will be very silly and very earnest. It will have words even you won\u2019t be able to get out of your head, and you will hate me in the way we hate anything that returns as soon as we stop holding it back. It will pass through your bones. It will fix some things and break some. You will keep it for the rest of your life, which I hope will be long. And someday you will give it away. That\u2019s the only way to keep it.\u201d\n\nPax considered this with the severity of a child comparing two deserts. \u201cEverybody thinks the dead are the soldiers,\u201d he said finally. \u201cBut the living carry all the heavy. Because we keep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ilyria said. She did. She had always known. She had wished not to.\n\nWhen they parted, Orrin walked beside her as flat roads turned to stairs again. He didn\u2019t ask her what her feathers were called. He didn\u2019t ask her where the light went at dawn. He asked her, kindly, \u201cWill it hurt?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, and did not mean to laugh when she said it, and laughed anyway. \u201cThe pop part is painless. The mind part is catastrophic. But not all at once. Don\u2019t look like that. If I need to, I\u2019ll teach you the part that holds me together until I can fall apart where it will frighten the fewest children. That\u2019s fieldcraft too.\u201d\n\nHe made a small shrug she could have hung a coat on. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a plan that includes children. We always do.\u201d\n\nBack in the alley, the lantern with six tapes around its belly caught a dying fly and sang to it, softly. Leta was already inside, making lists on the backs of lists. She did not ask whether Ilyria was coming back tomorrow; she wrote it down as if the future had already been obedient.\n\nOn the shelf, the old radio warbled without making an enemy of quiet. It was learning the word up. It was not a word. It was a direction.\n\nIlyria lay on the thin couch with the blanket that smelled of the studio and the cat and the kind of shampoo used by people who build transmitters by hand. Her body remembered shaking. It would take a while to stop. The hook in her mind was a polite guest tonight; it had eaten recently; it would wait. She closed her eyes and tried not to count. Counting can be a spell. Counting can attract things that like numbers.\n\nIn the hyper-clear place between waking and the other waking, she saw the Choir. Not as they had been, with their satin of bright logic, but as ghosts in a window when you look for something else. She saw their hands and their mouths, opening, closing. The silence that had swallowed them spoke, after all. It had always been speaking. It was saying, in its slow terrible grammar: You will give up everything you are to save someone else\u2019s favorite song. Do you consent.\n\nHer heart said yes by climbing.\n\nThe city slept. Someone in a hotel made from three specific dreams rolled over and found their foot had found a foot that trusted it. A Warden on the seawall adjusted his collar and hummed under his repaired breath. A boy called Pax put a hand under his pillow and touched the coil of wire he had rescued from a gutter in case it had a memory in it that he could use. The wind licked the words off the top of the amphitheater and carried them down into the drains where secrets like to be washed before anyone hears them. Up and up, my heart, up and up.\n\nIn the morning, they would map the places that had changed. In the morning, they would argue about batteries. In the morning, Ilyria would drink tea and take a breath and sit in a chair and make her mind a stage.\n\nTonight, she made a very small promise to herself, the size of a pin or a seed under anyone else\u2019s tongue. It sounded like a vow and like a hook and like a door opening in a song that should not have any doors.\n\nShe promised to learn the entire world\u2019s chorus before she sang it back. Or at least enough of it that when she let the big, silly, noisy, earnest, insistent song happen, it would know who it was speaking to.\n\nHer wings turned in her sleep and knocked gently against the side of the couch, like a neighbor who has lived there long enough not to mind the late hours. The lantern swayed, reconsidered, stayed.\n\nLong after, when the backline murmured to itself and even the wind had finished for the day, the old radio said, very softly, to the empty room. \u201cUp.\u201d Then it said, equally softly, as if taste-testing its own talent for language: \u201cTogether.\u201d And the silence did not eat that. Not yet. Not tonight.",

                              "content": "Morning in Glass Harbor did not arrive so much as remember itself. The percussive noises changed instruments, the vendors tightened their jokes, the sea exhaled color that had been kept under a tarp all night, and along the seawall the Wardens did not so much wake as rotate duties between shells. Ilyria rose with the awkwardness of someone who had slept next to a machine and dreamt in wires, her bones a little out of order, her feathers pretending to be cloth so conscientiously that one or two of them had staged a protest against it. The cat chose to forgive her for taking the couch by sitting on her toes, and the old radio made a sound like it was chewing sugar and did not want to be caught.\n\nLeta had left a list on the desk that carried the weight of a treaty. The list had the sort of handwriting that meant business and the sort of jokes in the margins that meant mercy. Orrin arrived between the second and third cup of tea with the same unflustered punctuality as bad weather, and Ilyria watched the way his presence smoothed the room the way a palm smooths a wrinkled letter. He said nothing about the night beyond a nod to the old radio and a look he loaned her that meant we will count together.\n\nThey went out into a city that had tucked the word up into its belt. On a tram someone had chalked the hook on the floor between the doors where people stand with their bags and their regrets, and as the tram braked, three strangers hummed the syllable like they had agreed on it without knowing one another\u2019s faces. A fishmonger with hands like bruised marble whistled a rising fragment as he packed shaved ice into a crate, and when his knife slipped he jerked back and laughed as if he had been caught trying to steal from his own pockets. In a laundry courtyard a line of wet shirts clapped together and made a thin rising rhythm that would have gone unnoticed yesterday.\n\nLeta did not so much take notes as persuade them. She walked and listened and let the city tell on itself, and Ilyria could tell when she heard something truly interesting because her shoulders found a new posture and stayed there like they had discovered better furniture. Pax turned up with a roll of paper taller than he was and a fistful of rubber bands he wore like bracelets, and he set himself to taping the new map segments down with the gravity of a boy allowed to hold sharp scissors. He had drawn circles around the places where the backline had found listeners, and triangles where the dampening kept winning, and he added a small star where he said nothing made any sense and it made him itchy to stand there.\n\nMarrowdale was itchy. It had not been a neighborhood so much as a habit, and habits, when interrupted, sulk. The streets there were too straight and then suddenly too curved, the buildings too proud of their bricks, the plaza too convinced that a fountain could fix anything that a fountain could not fix. Orrin\u2019s dead knew these corners the way a hand knows a pocket, and the ones on duty now wore the deliberate alertness of people who intend to be serious in front of their younger siblings. They had not smiled for practice, and so the residue of last night\u2019s fixed smile had not stuck to them, which was a relief, and Ilyria found the young Warden from the chair near the statue of a woman pouring water eternally into nothing.\n\nHe was on his feet. Someone had given him a cane that had been made for someone shorter, which made him a little jaunty against his will, and he had the exhausted pride of a person who has not failed yet today. When he saw Orrin he straightened, which for a moment made him look not nineteen but precisely the age that obedience makes you. He did not remember the chair or the piano that had not been there, but he remembered the word, and he said it softly like he was checking a compass. Up, he said, and his knuckles tapped pattern against his thigh that was not a march but a measure, and Orrin answered him in the same rhythm as if shaking hands without touching.\n\nThe dampening hid in seams. Leta traced her finger along a line of rivets and said that when the negative-song comes, it creeps where maintenance forgot to go. It likes cable trays and stairwells, she told them, and it has a taste for freight elevators and for the hollow parts under stages. She showed Ilyria a set of squiggles on the map that anyone else would have called a mistake and told her no, this is where someone decided the blueprint should not be public, and Ilyria felt the way the wave nested there like a bird who had decided to occupy a mouth.\n\nBy noon they had a pattern with holes in it. The holes were either where the wind was strong enough to refuse to host an intruder, or where the intruder had dug in so well that surface listening only traced its memory. Orrin made quiet calls with his pin pressed to his sleeve in a way that meant it could carry voice if he fed it careful breath, and the Wardens at the other end of those murmurs returned bearings like men delivering eggs in a storm. Pax ran messages with an efficiency that suggested he had conquered the geometry of alleys and was not impressed by maps that pretended his routes did not exist. The Council\u2019s courier arrived twice and left twice and on the second visit confessed shyly to Leta that he had been hearing the word in his sleep and his wife had not yelled at him about it, which he suspected might be love.\n\nCommunications Sub-committee attempted to recruit them during a break where a break was not available. They arrived in a clump that made the street slimmer, carrying clipboards as if they were shields, and the chairwoman, who wore her hair in a bun so tight that it seemed to have learned its own discipline, thanked Ilyria for her civic-mindedness in terms so flawless they might have been ironed. She had developed, overnight, a list of approved phrases and a schedule that could be used for dissemination, and she had designed a poster in which the word UP crushed the word SHADOW beneath it with the help of three lightning bolts and a cartoon Warden with improbably straight teeth.\n\nLeta was polite in the way a cat is polite to a vacuum cleaner. She took the schedule and folded it until it could fit inside a pocket that did not exist and promised to obey it whenever physics allowed. Ilyria answered a question about the frequency band with a description of a river that chooses its own banks and watched the chairwoman\u2019s attention move away and return like a kite in shifting wind. Orrin said nothing at all and stood directly behind Ilyria, which made the committee\u2019s expressions settle into a compromise between flattered and wary, and in the end the chairwoman shook Leta\u2019s hand and said something bland that almost, if you twisted it, counted as permission.\n\nThe radio learned. It repeated up with slightly different accents, as if testing which vowels made the bone most willing to rock, and when Ilyria set her palm on its plastic casing, the hum unrolled like a carpet and showed her the marks the dampening had left behind. She pressed with the same caution she would use on a stranger\u2019s soft throat, and in that contact there was a glimpse of a memory that was not hers. The memory was of a dark room where screens had once burned arcs into faces and of pipes that carried sound in the way blood carries oxygen, and of a hand that had a scar across the palm press the wrong button very gently because nothing ought to be rough with a wrong button. She did not tell the others what she saw, not because she wanted to hoard it, but because words would change it and she was not yet ready to spend that currency.\n\nThe afternoon bent toward wind. Leta drew three triangles on the map and connected them with a line so crooked it insisted upon being right, and she said that if they stood at these points in a stagger and listened, they would hear where the pressure drew tightest. The points were not obvious, which made Ilyria like them more. One was the tram depot with its roof designed to be a listening drum and its floors designed to be scrubbed by a generation that would no longer own trams. One was a bell tower that had not rung since the day the clock beneath it decided to tell the truth about time and was summarily reassigned to a job that involved rotating banners. One was Spindle Yard, a wedge of rooftops where small urban turbines worked themselves into minor frenzies for the city grid and then cooled like dogs with their tongues out.\n\nThey divided the work. Orrin took the bell tower, because stairs, and because his kind were good at being obvious in a way that made others behave. Leta took the depot because she wanted to listen to the rails and because she liked the acoustics under the long tin roof, and she bribed the depot master with a bag of hard candies and a promise to fix his personal radio if she lived. Ilyria took Spindle Yard, because the wind there had a history of making up its mind, and because she could talk to the turbines without a translator. Pax went with her as if he had decided she was in need of an assistant who could fit into places where angels could not go, and on the way up the last flight, he told her about his aunt\u2019s garden and how the vegetables had argued with the rain this year and which one had won.\n\nSpindle Yard smelled like a library of tin roofs. The little turbines spun like polite opinions, and between them someone had strung flags the color of arguments at a wedding and the nets that kept pigeons honest. Ilyria let the coat pretend one more time and shrugged it off, feather by feather, until standing with her wings as they were felt like apologizing and then not apologizing, and Pax watched with the solemn greed of a person who has just discovered he will get to keep a secret he never could have imagined. She raised her hands and touched not the machines but the air above them, and the first thing she felt was gratitude.\n\nThe gratitude was for the hooks she had given away. The wind had caught them and tied them to itself and carried them along like kites without strings, and where the dampening had been heavy, it now found itself bumping into something that had definition. The second thing she felt was irritation from the dampening where it struck those bright places, as if finding furniture in a dark room where once there had been nothing but shadow, and then the irritation turned thin and rippled into something like strategy. Someone was learning from her as quickly as she was learning from them, and if she had not been what she was, the thought would have broken her concentration.\n\nPax had set up three soda cans with pebbles in them like a high-efficiency bad instrument, and he tapped them in a pattern that was, somehow, the way staircases sound when you run up them with hope. The pebbles told him when she got close to a right place because their rattling changed from random to something a little stuck, and when she stepped left and forward, the leftmost can stopped entirely. The boy grinned and then seemed to remember he was trying to be a professional and made his face stern again, but his shoes gave him away by bouncing.\n\nIlyria found the seam. The wave was coming through one turbine like a whisper dragged through a reed, and she felt where someone had filed a tiny notch into the cap and laid a coil underneath that was not in the plans. The coil had been wound tight and then painted so it looked like any other part, and it had a resonance that would have been harmless if not for the wind\u2019s consistency. She did not touch it with her hands. She touched it with the part of her that the Choir had taught to dismantle songs and put them back together, and she put her ear to the difference until she understood its shape, and when she opened her eyes, Pax had moved closer without moving at all.\n\n\u201cYou look like a teacher who is also a knife,\u201d he said, not quite whispering.\n\n\u201cI am only sharp if you push,\u201d she told him, and he believed her as completely as a child believes a well-told lie. She called Leta on a line that was a wire and a ritual and told her what she had found, and Leta swore in three languages that were not hers and said the depot had the same coil under its light fixtures. Orrin arrived on the channel with no ornament and said the bell tower had it in the hollow of the bell, which was almost funny except it was not.\n\nThe coils were not accidents. They had been placed by hands that knew their work would be seen eventually, which meant either arrogance or invitation, and Ilyria did not like either option. Pax asked if he could steal the one in front of them and take it home for his shelf of interesting crimes, and Ilyria said no because theft has a sound and sometimes the sound is bait. She crouched and let the hum press against her forehead like a feverish child, and she sang the smallest possible note she could make, so small that it would not fit inside a microphone, and so pure that it could not carry extra meaning without breaking.\n\nThe coil went quiet for a moment that could not have happened if the map of the city had not been wrong about who owned the wind. The pause was clean. It told her two things at once, which was considerate for a machine. It told her the coils did not create the dampening, they refined it. It told her that somewhere not far and not near, a central breath took the in and the out and decided how hard to press. She stood and let her wings shrug a little, and a shadow in the stairwell that had decided it was a man because it had a hat, detached from its wall and resolved into an actual person who had been waiting for her to finish so he could either change his mind or do what he had come to do.\n\nHe had no pin. His suit was the kind that does not belong to anyone until it belongs to everyone, and his shoes were polite to gravel. When he spoke, his voice had the professional softness of someone who had practiced on ears while the ears belonged to people who could not interrupt, and his smile wanted to be practiced but had not been given enough time to suffer yet. He called her Bright like a man who had been warned about manners. He told Pax that children should not climb and that he himself had never fallen except when it mattered. He addressed Leta on the open line by name and asked her to tell Orrin to holster the weapon he did not carry because the Wardens had been very clear about optics.\n\nLeta said she did not entertain bricks with mouths when she was working. Orrin walked onto the roof from nowhere and made the space that the man could use to move smaller by existing in it with his quiet. Pax crossed his arms and looked at the man in a way that suggested a slingshot might presently invent itself if it discovered the need. Ilyria kept her hands where he could see them and wondered what benches and committees had taught this man to wear his gravity like a tincture instead of a stone.\n\nThe man introduced himself as Aurek. It was a name with letters that were good at carrying weight and at not being from here. He said he represented an organization whose name he did not share, which suggested it was either too proud of itself to speak easily or too ashamed of itself to risk being remembered. He complimented the city\u2019s resilience and excused himself for having to be the sort of person who arrived waving concerns. He informed them gently that the coils were protected property and should not be removed without authorization, and in the way he said it was notarized anxiety and the skin of a shark.\n\n\u201cAuthorization by whom,\u201d Leta asked, which was not a question so much as a fishing line.\n\n\u201cBy the Concord,\u201d Aurek said, and made the word taste like cinnamon so no one noticed the iron filings until it was too late. He held his hands low and away from his jacket the way people do when they have permits. He explained, with the tiny pauses of someone moving on stones that are not fully embedded, that the dampening wave was a pilot program to prevent riot conditions in coastal cities during resource stress, that it had gone into tests in several locations and produced promising results in metrics that he of course did not have on him, and that some variables were misbehaving in Glass Harbor due to unusual acoustic architecture and the presence of high-variance actors.\n\nHe meant them. He meant Ilyria\u2019s bones. He meant Leta\u2019s deviations. He meant the Wardens\u2019 literal skeletons, tuned like instruments, which any sensible empire would have set to a key and kept in a case. Orrin did not move, which was information if you knew him. Leta said the words pilot program very slowly as if she wanted to see whether saying them at a different pace would make them less cruel. Pax put his foot on the nearest turbine and the turbine shuddered as if startled, which seemed to please him.\n\n\u201cYou turn people down like radios,\u201d Ilyria said. She kept her voice a woven thing, not a blade. She wanted him to hear as much as he could before he stopped listening. \u201cYou coat silence on bones and then pretend you have given the city a coat it wanted. You installed coils in the lungs of the wind\u2019s machines and you called it working with the weather. You did not ask. You counted us instead of letting us count.\u201d\n\nAurek blinked. For the first time since he had spoken, his face did not do what faces do when they believe the room is theirs. He spread his fingers as if to show her the lines he had paid to be written into them. He suggested that the Concord had consulted with several representatives of municipal governments who had signed documents using pens with special ink. He regretted that the presence of post-mortal security units made the city unusually susceptible, and he said the phrase post-mortal security units like he was proud of having learned the kind wording. He offered to set up a meeting where concerns could be addressed in an orderly fashion.\n\nLeta said a word that was short and old and patriotic in a way the Concord would not appreciate. Orrin looked at Aurek as if he were reading the instructions on a device that claimed to be safe around water, and then he asked the question he had been born twice to ask. What happens if we turn it off, he said, with the stillness of a person who will catch a falling blade with his teeth if asked, and the man in the suit did not answer immediately.\n\nWhen he did, he said that the wave had been designed to refuse sudden discontinuities in the interest of avoiding shock events. He said sudden discontinuities were correlated with panic, which he had learned in a course about crowd control that had used footage of people with faces, and which he had not watched with the sound on. He said the wave would persist at a basal level for a period of days, then weeks, then possibly forever unless seeded to a new standard. He said forever like it was a shelf life.\n\nThe wind bit the edge of the roof in a way that meant go. Ilyria said that she appreciated the information and would be leaving with it, and Aurek lifted his chin in resigned agreement and asked quietly if she would be willing to come to a demonstration of the wave under controlled conditions in a facility where their safety would be guaranteed. Pax made a noise that sounded like a laugh someone had put in his backpack by accident. Leta leaned forward and plucked a hair from Aurek\u2019s jacket sleeve like it was a mechanical error and she intended to fix it later, and then she gave him a smile that had no teeth in it and meant report back that we are not going to be manageable.\n\nThey left the coil in place because it was better to understand what it spoke than to make it turn to whisper elsewhere. They set little mirrors around the turbine that Ilyria tilted with her fingers to make the wind stumble just enough that the wave carried badly when it tried to ride the air, and Leta adjusted her backline so that anyone listening there would hear a joke about eels that was a code asking Wardens to count aloud at intersections. Orrin walked down the stairs so slowly that Aurek was forced to stand still and wait or break the dignity he thought he wore like a hat, and Pax walked backward so he would not miss anything in case the man decided to sprout an extra face.\n\nBack at the studio, the air tasted like a plan you did not trust yet. Leta unrolled the map and laid it flat and set a dozen batteries on the corners so that suspicion could not curl back up again, and Ilyria drew with a stub of graphite the way the wave had moved when she pressed. She sketched the pause and the tightening and the way the pressure had felt the instant before it retreated, and the picture looked like a drum skin with a thumb in it. Orrin consulted with two Wardens over a line that had been designed for inventory lists and now had become an artery, and he asked them to hum at shift change in the pattern of up and to tie the word to two others that he chose with a skill they had not thought him capable of.\n\nThe others were together and hold. He had seen the radio learn, and he had decided to teach the dead to make new vowels with old mouths. They did not need to say the word love if the bones did not like it; they could say the word hold and the world would hear the two sit together. Ilyria watched him teach the pattern with the careful cruelty of someone who knows that if you give people something too beautiful before they have footings, they will fall. He did it in steps. He counted. The Wardens on the other end made the shape of the sound with their throats and sent it back through wire and promise, and the room had for a minute the crackle of a storm lying down.\n\nPax slept at the desk with his face on his arms, and his back rose and fell as if he were the tide made small. Leta paid the cat with string to tolerate a lap, and in the quiet that understood its job, Ilyria remembered the dark room, and the hand, and the wrong button pressed gently. She thought of the Choir and of the day the replies did not come, and the way silence can behave like a body if you treat it ceremoniously. She realized with a clarity that did not hurt until after that the Concord had not invented the wave. They had found it. They had bent it. They had leaned it toward their kind of civility and called it medicine, and somewhere in their patient records they had a chart full of compliance curves and names that had once belonged to people.\n\nNight came again not to repeat but to continue a sentence. The Council sent a request that was not optional for them to appear at a temporary annex because the Chairwoman had discovered that one of the coils had been installed inside a classroom heater at a school where children had recently learned the multiplication table by hopping on squares of carpet. The Wardens wanted to show them the place where three of their number had stood at a corner and, for four minutes that had felt like an hour, believed themselves to be on parade while the market around them went on doing the ordinary work of living. Leta wanted to tear up the coils one by one and wear them like bracelets so the city would have to ask her to take them off, which was not a plan and not a joke, and Ilyria wanted, suddenly and violently, to go to the place that was neither far nor near and find the breath that was deciding for everyone.\n\nThe place did not have a name. It had several names, which is the same as not having one at all. Some called it the Archive because it had once held blueprints. Some called it the Hall because of the way noise did strange arithmetic there. Some called it the Pylon because it rose out of the ground like an excuse for the sky to gather. The Concord called it a signal cache, because they loved to pretend that there were words that would make the world a filing cabinet. Pax called it the place with the windows that stared back.\n\nThey went because going was better than waiting. Orrin filed nothing except his chin and the angle at which he would stand if he were required to look harmless while holding a wall. Leta packed a bag that would not have cleared a checkpoint anywhere that feared talent, and she stuck the old radio inside because she wanted it to learn again tonight if there was anything worth learning. Ilyria put her coat on and let it be a coat because surprise is a weapon too, and if she arrived as a woman with odd taste rather than as a rumor with feathers, maybe the building would let her thoughts take the stairs.\n\nThe Pylon sat at the end of a street that had decided it could be an avenue if only someone believed in it hard enough. It had windows that did not repeat but variations, and it had a door that had learned too many sizes and would not settle. Inside, the air had been taught to smell like official history, which is to say paper and stone and the breath people hold when they are reading something they want to remember and cannot. A guard at the desk made a show of looking up and of being neutral, and then looked properly at Orrin and could not help the way his eyes softened because some part of him still believed in the dead.\n\nThey let themselves be checked because refusals are also spells, and sometimes you do not want to cast that one. They went up in an elevator designed to make the stomach confess sins, and when the doors opened, Aurek was waiting with a clipboard and a cardigan and a face that had been to a mirror and received no useful advice. He asked them to step into a demonstration chamber as if he were inviting them to stand under a waterfall but promising they would not drown, and he talked about measured exposure and calibration curves and the sort of words that mean we have already done this to someone else and now it is your turn.\n\nThe chamber was a handsome room that had been built to impress people who were already in love with the idea of rooms. The walls were lined with panels that coveted names like baffle and diffuser, and there were speakers that looked like polite sculptures and vents that were not for air. There were chairs made to be sat in by people who do not mind being asked to sit at length. There was a table with water on it and a stack of forms that had decided whether they were contracts or certificates. There was a sound that was not a sound yet and wanted to be.\n\nIlyria stepped very nearly into the center, which is the only place to stand if you mean what you say, and Leta took up a position near a panel that had cantilevered itself like a gossip, and Orrin chose the corner where his absence would have been most conspicuous. Aurek made a small speech without adjectives, which is itself a kind of adjective, and then he raised his hand like a conductor and nodded to the technician behind the glass. The wave entered.\n\nIt was a gentle thing in that second. It arrived as if someone had taught it pleases and thank yous, and it did not push, it persuaded. It showed Ilyria the outline of her own heartbeat and then suggested a more reliable model. It offered the easy rest you feel when you finish a task and convince yourself you do not need to start another. It laid the blank page between two pages with writing and said perhaps later. If she had been almost anyone else, she would have sighed and called it relief.\n\nBut she was not anyone else, and she had spent the night making promises that sounded like hooks, so the wave met a mind with a stage set and a pattern waiting in the curtains. It tried to remove the score and discovered that she knew where the players stood without looking. It attempted to lower the lights and discovered that good music does not need them. It pushed, finally, because persuasion had failed, and in that push was the part that would break bones if bones believed the story of their own obsolescence.\n\nLeta saw it on the monitor in a line that should not have moved that way. She did the only thing she was ever going to do, which was to put the old radio on the table and turn its dial with fingers that had said earlier today they would not be asked to do something like this. Orrin counted aloud, as if reminding a room that stillness was a choice, and his numbers ran like rope. Ilyria said the words she had invented for children and soldiers and dead men who remember, and she folded them over the wave like cloth, and when the breath pressed, it pressed into a shape that said up and together and hold.\n\nThe wave skid. It skid the way a thought skid when you are interrupted by a joke you know is better than the serious thing you intended to say. For a moment that a watch would not admit had happened, it made a new shape where the central breath could be. Aurek\u2019s smile returned to his face in the manner of a person who has decided to act like he owns the conclusion, and he said that they saw that the Bright\u2019s harmonics were of considerable interest and that perhaps there was a way to work together for the improvement of public morale. Ladled over the phrasing was a politeness that had a lid, and under the lid was a thing with spines.\n\nIlyria looked at the glass behind which a man with a headset had been instructed to be precise without being curious. She looked at Aurek\u2019s careful cardigan and at the forms on the table that wanted to be definitions. She thought of the coils hidden in vents and bells and turbines, and of the boy\u2019s itchy place on the map, and of a hand pressing the wrong button gently because gentleness is sometimes a better weapon than force. She did not wait for permission, because when a song knows its chorus, permission is a whistle far away.\n\nShe sang not into the room but into the part of the room that had been kept aside for later. The note was brief because the brief is what they had, and it was steep because she had learned last night what shape made the wave most clumsy, and it carried the smallest possible joke she could write in the moment, which was to pronounce the word hold like a door being held for a stranger you might one day love. It went out through vents not meant for music and into ducts not meant for air, and into the building\u2019s bones that had not been asked whether they wanted to be instruments, and in the floor below them a filing cabinet quietly realigned its contents because it had decided that there were better systems than alphabetical.\n\nThe technician made a sound he had not signed a form to make. Aurek\u2019s hand twitched in a gesture that wanted to be a reach for control and had to settle for control\u2019s cousin, and Orrin laughed without laughing, which changed the pressure of the room enough to allow breathing again. Leta turned the radio off because two seconds had happened at least twice, and Ilyria felt the cost announce itself in the small distance between her core and her edges that would need to be traveled with care later. That was all right. She had been traveling that distance since she had woken to the sky and found no reply.\n\nThey did not break the wave that day. They did not dismantle the coils or topple the Concord out of its careful metaphors. They walked out of the building with the politeness you extend to a house in a neighborhood where children play, and with the co-conspiracy that grows between those who have just not drowned. Pax was waiting at the bottom of the steps with a sandwich wrapped in newsprint that had been printed six months ago because newsprint did not care what day it thought it was, and he handed half to Ilyria and half to Leta as if he had calculated exactly how much bread bravery can eat before it starts to turn useless.\n\nOutside, the city had developed overnight a habit of tapping. People tapped the railings and tabletops and their own cheeks in rhythms that would have been upsetting if you did not know that counting is a way to not be in the cart time is hauling you in. The Wardens found that they could hum under their breath without being asked and the hum did not turn traitor, and a woman in a wheelchair at the corner near the dumpling stall sang into her lap and discovered it made her hands less afraid. The wind had taken to saying the joke about eels to itself, the one that was a code, and the gulls imitated the cadence so convincingly that several men in hats looked up and smiled without meaning to.\n\nNight made its second proposal in two days. They said no by staying up. Leta wrote down how to tune a city so that silly things can hold weight, and she made a list on which she promised to make six very important mistakes tomorrow so that she could find out which ones were worth making again. Orrin did a tour of the perimeter he would have done anyway, except this time he taught a private in stitches a way to count backwards that made the shadow miss a step, and when he came back he brought with him three stories and a coil he had not stolen but had asked very firmly for until someone had decided that giving it to him would be a relief.\n\nIlyria lay on the couch and thought about breath. She thought about the central breath that pushed and refused to claim itself, and about the breaths of children asleep in rooms with their windows cracked to let in the word they had learned today, and about the breath the city itself took when you stand very still on the right hill at dusk and listen for what it thinks of what it is becoming. She decided that she could not undo a wave invented by men who loved patience more than people by being perfect. She could only be insistently beautiful in the most ridiculous way and trust the part of bones that had not agreed to be organized against themselves.\n\nIn the morning, they would go to the school with the heater that had been convinced to sing quietly. In the morning, they would send a message out along the backline that would seem like gossip and become instruction. In the morning, the Council would say the word liability and Orrin would say the word corridor and Leta would say the word seconds, and Pax would draw a circle on the map that would later turn out to be the place where they made the city decide whether it wanted to consent to its own quiet. For now, the old radio muttered to itself like an elderly relative with a puzzle, and the lantern in the alley burned with the stubbornness of a small light that has seen large darkness and refuses to be impressed.",

                              "content": "Morning did not ask permission to come in; it jimmied the lock and let itself into every window that had remembered to be glass. The old school on Miter Street woke like a creature that had been taught its routine fifty years ago and had learned to forgive every revision. The children arrived in layers, sweaters unbuttoned by the walk, bookbags telling their own clattering story, voices carrying fog inside and sunlight out. A teacher held a clipboard like a shield and smiled in the way adults do when they would like children to trust them with smaller secrets than they deserve. Someone had chalked up times tables and then, on a whim or an accident, inserted a word between the numbers so that nine times six was now up and up, and nobody had erased it because sometimes vandalism is a contribution.\n\nThe heater in Room Seven pretended to be a wall. It hummed as walls hum when they have learned to accept their lives, which is to say it hummed with resignation. Leta asked the custodian for the key to the cage, and the custodian produced a ring that contained twelve keys for doors that had been removed and one for this one, and she made a ceremony of handing it over as if permission were an old religion. The grill came open with a screech that had a note in it that made Pax look up, and the coil revealed itself the way a lie reveals the trick it thinks is best hidden. It had been wound with care and painted to match the dust, and its ends had been tucked under an inch of insulation so that fingers with good intentions would miss it.\n\nIlyria knelt on a scuffed tile that had worn its polish off telling children not to run. The coil sang to her without sound, the way a thing at the edge of hearing will brag quietly to the part of your mind that remembers danger in water. She did not touch metal. She touched the small shaped absence around the metal and convinced it for a breathing\u2019s worth of time that it had never been asked to harden. The heater sighed. That was all it would do for now. The dampening did not like to be dismissed in public.\n\nThe class came in mid-moment. They saw adults near warm mystery and became very still with the particular quiet peculiar to classrooms, a quiet that lives on the edge of eruption. The teacher introduced them all without quite remembering why she trusted them, and the children introduced themselves in a chorus that sounded like people rehearsing for their own names. A girl with one ear glittering said, \u201cAre you the Bright,\u201d as if that were an insult and a compliment, and Ilyria said she was a person who listened to heaters misbehave, which made four children decide to love her exactly until summer.\n\nLeta demonstrated nothing. She asked the children to hum their favorite sound for the count of three, and twenty-three throats produced a rope of noise that was part engine, part bee, and part new shoes on polished floor. Orrin stood in the doorway and watched the windows because old habits make good guards. The little hum filled the room without touching anyone\u2019s fear, and when it faded, Ilyria let a strand of up and together ride in the space the children had made. It wasn\u2019t much. It did not belong to her once she\u2019d let it go. It settled in the heater like forgiveness.\n\nPax chalked a tiny triangle on the baseboard in a place only people who drop their pencils would ever see. He did not explain it, even when the girl with the glittering ear asked if it was a secret code, and when she frowned and asked him if he was older than he looked, he told her he had been old and then forgotten how and had decided to start again. The teacher made a noise that was not permission and not disapproval and then asked the class to sit, because sitting is how you begin magic that pretends to be learning.\n\nThey stayed only long enough to catch the way the coil\u2019s influence had been softened and the way it went looking for sharper corners. On the way out, the custodian pressed Leta\u2019s fingers and said that when she vacuumed the hall last night she had hummed up without meaning to and found herself pushing the machine like it was a dance partner, and she thanked them with her eyes for making a chore agree to be music. Orrin took a list from the teacher, names of students who startled at loud noises and of those who, when asked to sing, preferred to be weather, and he stored those names with the brief tenderness that men who have died often carry for children.\n\nThe Council annex smelled like three different hand soaps choosing dominance. The communications chairwoman had made copies of the poster where UP had pinned SHADOW like a butterfly in a display case, and she spoke in a cadence that turned every phrase into an item number. Liability entered the room as a guest of honor and took a seat where it could be seen. The ringed woman said that the coils represented a breach of something but could not say of what; collar-suit said that the Concord had filed notice with the West Quayside Committee last spring and waved a paper that had nothing to do with anything; the new-book one asked how many songs a person could be expected to carry before they began to confuse themselves with a choir.\n\nLeta said seconds again, and her patience left a mark on the desk like a watermark. She traced a route that would let them try a loud test without breaking anyone who did not consent, and she pointed to the three triangles on her map that she had decided were the places to pin the city so that the cloth of sound would stretch in an even way. She insisted on safe corridors not because she wanted permission but because she understood that permission is a channel you can pour care into. Orrin promised bodies at corners and gentle hands that would become iron if needed; he promised counts and he promised the kind of stillness that can be found in storms. Ilyria described what the cost felt like and did not dramatize it, and in that decision there was more drama than any Council member wanted to own.\n\nThey left with a blessing that pretended to be a caution. The chairwoman handed Leta a badge that would get her past three doors and no guards and called it authority. The ringed woman touched Ilyria\u2019s wrist as if to weigh it and then let her go with an apology written in the skin near her thumb. The man in collar-suit asked Orrin if he slept, and Orrin said he did when other people could afford to, and neither of them mentioned that sleep has a smell you miss.\n\nAurek waited where people who think they understand context like to wait, which is in places where context happens to other people. He had a paper cup and the relaxed shoulders of someone who believes that proposals sound kinder near a coffee cart. He said the Concord\u2019s pilot had two weeks left before the next phase, which would be distribution to additional cities, at which point alterations would be expensive for everyone involved. He offered a form of partnership that would let Glass Harbor claim co-authorship of the solution, and he offered Leta a stipend and Orrin a separate chain of command and Ilyria a room full of microphones and the myth of control.\n\nNobody answered him in the language he wanted. Leta thanked him for putting his mouth where they could see it and then turned her back to call the depot and ask if the night guard liked licorice. Orrin did not step closer, which is a way of stepping farther away. Ilyria told him politely that music does not belong to governments, which flustered him not because he disagreed but because he had not expected to be asked to agree. Pax wandered by with a roll of tape and a look that said he would gladly tie this man's shoelaces together if it would save a life.\n\nThey could feel the wave tighten. It is a strange thing to know a pressure that is not air. The dampening gathered itself that afternoon the way someone gathers arguments before sitting across from a friend they intend to lose. The backline burred with small alarms only people who loved the backline could hear. Leta called out the points with the finality of an oath\u2014Depot, Drumhouse rim, Spindle Yard\u2014and Ilyria could feel the ampersands between them like handclasps. Orrin sent two squads along the upper streets to act as bluish lights in fog, the sort that tell a boat which way a shore has chosen to be true.\n\nThey deployed at a pace that was not quite a run and not quite a march, and the city seemed to step aside to make room for necessity. At the depot, under the roof that had learned everyone\u2019s footsteps, Leta rerouted music like a plumber with a grudge and tuned the trestles with a mallet until they stopped sulking about their rust. At the Yard, Ilyria made the turbines complicit in a petty act of rebellion and smiled when they rose to the occasion like small dogs delighted to be considered wolf. On Drumhouse\u2019s rim, Pax set down six tin cans in a line and told each a secret none of the others would forgive, and he listened to the difference like he was learning to read weather.\n\nThe Wardens became choir in the gutters between. They did not sing, not in the way people fear and envy, but they allowed their breathing to be counted aloud at corners and they watched their own faces when the dampening pressed, and they held each other the way dancers do when they have agreed on this, this, now. Orrin did not tell them to be brave. He told them to be specific. He told them that when the pressure came, it would feel like someone trying to finish a sentence for them, and that their best answer was a silly word they would not have thought worthy of a war. They practiced not because practice makes perfect but because practice makes habit, and habit is what you fall to when gravity argues.\n\nIt came in a half hour of afternoon most people have always thought belongs to no one. The dampening spread like fog under doors and decided to be heavy. A trolley stalled with its doors open and passengers inside laughed that brittle laughter people laugh when they do not want to call a thing by its name. A preacher in a pocket park forgot mid-harangue why he had trained his voice the way you train a dog. At the pier, three gulls landed in a triangle and did not move and every fisherman who saw them made the sign he had inherited from a grandfather who had superstitions tattooed on his knuckles.\n\nLeta\u2019s voice hit the backline like a pebble on a tin roof. She did not shout because shouting is a drug that does not do what you hope. She said now with the authority of the person who has watched your face for days and knows exactly which second of your asking is real. The depot vibrated into readiness. Drumhouse lifted its head. The Yard spun slyer and made its own wind. Ilyria closed her eyes and made her mind small on purpose.\n\nThe hook was not a weapon; it was a chair set out in the middle of panic. She gave the city a place to sit. Up and together and hold went out in a pattern that had learned patience. It did not claw. It did not wrestle. It became background the way your heartbeat does until you remember it is there and are grateful for the proof. The dampening ran into that shape and found itself briefly obliged to occupy it, and in the instant before it twisted free, it forgot what it had intended to do. In that forgetting, people finished sentences. Someone inside the trolley sang two notes in a voice like wire and someone else laughed like water falling, the good way.\n\nGlass Harbor did not become safe. It did become less alone. The wave tightened again, and the wind obeyed their mirrors and errored gently, and the heaters in unnumbered rooms sounded like old men clearing their throats before saying something honest. Leta cued a sound into the backline that in any other city would have been a joke about a broken traffic light and here became a request that everyone at a window tap twice and then twice again, and for a thin, unphotogenic minute, the city sounded like rain remembered itself.\n\nThe push ebbed because even pressure needs leverage. The coils kept doing their work, patient traitors to their hosts, and Aurek\u2019s building sent a pulse that was measured and kind until you noticed the fact of its existence at all. People went back to their markets and to their supper tables and to their dogs, who forgave the panic because they always do. Ilyria sat on the parapet of the Yard and let her wings be not a coat, and she put her forehead on her arm and swallowed the ache that had come as promised. She had spent only seconds, but seconds in the right place draw blood from a person who has decided to be bridge instead of bank.\n\nPax climbed up beside her with the unconscious grace of children who have not been told that grace is rare. He gave her half an apple that had seen better days and he told her, matter-of-fact, that his aunt had cried at the sink when a silence left their house like a guest they had been afraid to ask to leave. He asked her if the big song would hurt the city forever, the one she kept telling them would have to happen, and she could not lie to him properly because honesty had decided, recently, to be her hobby.\n\n\u201cIt will change what your bones reach for,\u201d she said, and because he was a child and did not have as many useless words to put between himself and truth, he nodded like a small judge and said that he would make his bones learn to reach for good things.\n\nOrrin found them with the walk of a man who has just finished doing a thing that matters and is suspicious of any room that offers praise. He checked Ilyria with his eyes like a medic who has learned to take a pulse without touching, and then he said the Wardens below had made a choice he wanted her to hear before it hardened into ritual without options. They had decided to teach their new recruits a different three-part count, one that said hold on me in the first part and hold on each other in the second and hold on the city in the third. He wanted to know if she thought that was right.\n\n\u201cI think you make a better priest than I do,\u201d she said, and he laughed softly in the way a man laughs when you hand him a word he never wanted and it fits anyway. Leta joined them with a fistful of wire ties and a look of bruised victory, and she said that someone down at the depot had called her their mayor without policy, and she had pretended not to like it, and they all sat with that for a minute and let themselves be unheroic.\n\nThey needed an answer to the central breath. They could not keep pushing back forever, not with candy and stubbornness. Leta laid the map on the roof again because roofs are what maps deserve, and she circled the places where the wave refused to slip and then circled them again, and the circles began to draw in a shape she hadn\u2019t intended. It was a half-ring, a necklace the city wore low. It traced the seawall and then dipped under in three places where maintenance forgot to go and where the old city had kept secrets even from itself. It pointed.\n\nPax told them a story about drains. He told them about the time last winter when the drains had clogged and the floodwater made a slow and persuasive argument with basements all along Spindle Yard, and how the men with tools had opened access doors that were not on any drawing and found not only pipes but blue ceramic tunnels the size of two men side by side, and how within those tunnels were little doors and older doors and a door with a window that stared back. He had not been allowed inside, except in the way children are not allowed inside which is to say as far as they can fit and no farther, and he had seen a mural of circles and lines that older people would call an engineering diagram and he had called instructions for a dancing machine.\n\nIlyria thought of the hand with the scar pressing the wrong button gently. She thought of how old cities carry hymns under their sewage, how cathedrals pour their voices into cisterns so that saints and rats can share them. She did not need to say the word archive or pylon. She said the word throat, and everyone understood. The city\u2019s voice had been routed through a mouth it did not know it had. The Concord, who liked to pretend that names could defang things, had found that mouth and given it vowel shapes it would not have chosen. If they could reach that throat, they could convince it to bite differently.\n\nThere was a brief and practical argument that somehow did not become a fight. Orrin wanted to send three squads and a rope and a pack that a pack animal could wear, never mind that no pack animal could be persuaded to climb down into a storm mouth in a city that smelled of itself. Leta wanted light and a transceiver that would bounce off ceramic and patience. Pax wanted to go because of course he did. Ilyria wanted only to be looked at like a tool and not like an answer, and when they managed it for a few minutes, her shoulders let the day in.\n\nThey planned as if planning could bless an outcome, and when evening arrived with its pockets full of harbor sounds, they went to the place where the seawall stopped pretending to be a wall and became a long story. The access hatch had been painted the shade of urgency that bureaucracies like, and it had rusted in the particular pattern of neglect that is a form of confidence. Two Wardens worked the bolts with quiet curses\u2014the old-fashioned kind that aren\u2019t about anyone\u2019s mother but about tools\u2014and when the cover came up, the breath from below could have been mistaken for cold if you did not know how disguised breath can be.\n\nPax went first until three hands caught him. He glared in the direction of adulthood and let himself be the fourth to descend, which he would tell later as if he had conceded nothing. Leta followed with a bag that had no right to weigh what it weighed and yet did, and her hair caught on a bolt and stayed there like a marker. Orrin took a ladder as if the ladder might have feelings, which is how you keep ladders from betraying you. Ilyria folded her wings enough to be courteous and climbed last, and in the darkness that accepted them without commentary, it was easy to be only a person.\n\nThe tunnels were older than manners. Ceramic lined them in the pale blue shade that cities choose when they are pretending water is easier than it is. The walls had been taught not to echo, which meant every sound they made sounded like a promise instead of a threat. There were signs painted by hands that did not have the word signage yet, arrows and circles and the occasional fish that might once have told a man with a bucket whether he would need an extra man with a rope. The air carried a rhythm that was not footsteps and not pumps, and Ilyria felt the way it counted without numbers. It was the city measuring itself.\n\nThey walked with the discipline that keeps groups from becoming noise. Pax kept ahead exactly far enough to make his point. Leta touched valves and named them like she was introducing two old friends who had forgotten how to shake hands. Orrin stopped the column once, twice, to let an imagined patrol pass, because if you practice against an enemy you pretend harder first. At a junction where three tunnels argued over purpose, the old radio in Leta\u2019s bag woke and made a shy noise, and she set it on the ceramic like a turtle finding a warm rock. The noise aligned itself with the rhythm in the walls, and the word up did not come because it had nothing to climb.\n\nThey reached the throat by not looking for it. It announced itself in negative, a place where sound did not behave as it had promised. The tunnel opened into a chamber that had been designed without architects and later dignified by technicians. Cables crossed like mistakes corrected. A wheel with teeth sat against a wall not connected to anything anyone could justify but too heavy to discard, and if Ilyria put her palm near it without touching, her hand remembered the way a hum has weight. In the center of the room was a column that had been poured and then cut. You could see the hand in the cut. You could see the patience.\n\nIt did not feel dangerous until they stepped toward it. Danger is not always a sensation; sometimes it is the awareness that you are inside an instrument and you do not know who is holding the bow. The column was full of air and not air. It was a tuned emptiness. Around its base were coils of the same persuasion as the ones in the heaters and bells, but larger, and nested like toys with ambitions. A panel on the wall bore a plaque with serial numbers and a date that had been scratched and re-stamped, which is how you know something has been made legal retroactively.\n\nLeta stood very still and let her eyes do the counting. She traced the path the pressure took and the return that kept it honest. She did not touch anything because touching is a language and she had not been taught this dialect. Orrin bent and read the plaque out loud, not because the numbers mattered but because speaking them took power away from the part of the world that pretended they were gods. Pax whispered that if you whistled here the whole city would whistle back, and Ilyria believed him too much to try.\n\nThe wave came through even here, thinner, like music someone is playing in a room down the hall when the door is open only a hand\u2019s width. It spoke in what it thought was common sense. It suggested that tiredness was a better use of time than action. It proposed that waiting was prudent. It made rest into law. Ilyria stood in front of the column and felt that gathering pressure stand at her back like a boy who would shove and then apologize politely. She put her hand to the emptiness and did not push. She offered it a joke.\n\nThe joke was a childish thing about doors. She did not have the leisure to craft elegance. She took the word hold from the day and folded it into what engineers call a defect and children call a weakness they can poke. She let hold mean doorstop. She asked the tuned emptiness if it had considered that a door held open on purpose is an invitation rather than a failure. She sang the tiniest note the column would accept without either shattering or laughing at her, and in that note was the dumb joy of songs people write for kitchens and unions.\n\nIt accepted it. That was all. It did not give back. It did not reform the world. It allowed the idea that an open door is a choice to sit near its root. The coils around the base did not cease their work, and Aurek\u2019s technicians would, in a room with good lighting, see no change they could justify to a budget, but in the city above, six people forgot to stop talking midway and continued instead, and one man put down a bottle he had needed and did not feel insulted by the absence of his need.\n\nThey could not stay. Water, which cares little for the wars of breath, announced an approaching duty with a sound someone had taught it for that very purpose. Orrin gathered them with a gesture that had kept men alive before, and they left as carefully as they had come. On the ladder up to air, Pax turned and looked down into the blue and said, to the column and to anyone else who might be listening, that he liked his city better when it remembered itself, and then he climbed into a night that had decided to test them again tomorrow.\n\nAboveground, Glass Harbor wore the look of a person who has smiled so long their cheeks are tired and they wonder whether it is acceptable to stop. The lantern in the alley still burned with its ridiculous faith. The old radio in Leta\u2019s bag made a sound that said it had learned a new vowel and would be smug about it. Orrin walked the block twice before letting himself lean against a wall, and when he did the wall seemed to feel better. Ilyria sat on the couch and did not pretend not to shake. Leta said that she would make tea and then forgot and instead began listing inventory on a scrap of paper because sometimes mercy arrives as bureaucracy.\n\nThey had not won anything you could put in a box. They had not toppled anyone or anything except a few small arguments inside machines. They had gifted the throat a doorstop and the city a silliness it might not have picked up on its own. When Ilyria fell asleep she did it with her mouth open like a child, and in the part of sleep that allows speech she said the word together as if testing whether it could do anything but mean itself. The city, which had not so much been saved as reminded, said it back in the tap of pipes and the brush of a cat choosing a lap, and under the seawall a column held one new idea it had not wanted and could not yet refuse.",

                              "content": "The day after the throat, the city behaved like someone who had found a foreign coin in their pocket and decided to buy coffee with it anyway. The stalls went up with the same practiced choreography and the same arguments about price and cricket scores and the moral adequacy of pears out of season, but the pauses were softer in the middle and shorter at the edges. People completed thoughts they had gotten used to abandoning. A woman on a balcony who had made a profession of sighing into the street discovered she could climb down the sigh like a ladder into ordinary laughter without slipping. On the seawall, a Warden who had ceased to hear the long note the harbor holds under its breath felt it return like a muscle waking, and he blinked as if a bird had flown very close and not quite touched his cheek.\n\nThe coils did not stop. They were patient machines and they had learned patience from men who liked to call it safety. In the bell tower, Orrin ran his hands along the braille of the bronze and felt the way the dampening used the metal to carry the idea of harmlessness. He taught the young ones to count with their tongues against their teeth instead of with their breath, because the wave had not yet learned that teeth can be metronomes. In the depot, Leta\u2019s name had become a rumor the rails were willing to repeat; when she walked under the roof, the girders produced a brief, improving hum as if to suggest they were thinking about posture, and she nodded at them with the rude affection she reserved for things she loved that were not people.\n\nIlyria slept in installments and woke as if she had been sketched between two lines and now had to choose which line to belong to. The hook in her head had developed a habit of waiting at thresholds with its hat on; it would not push in without being asked, which was an elegance she did not expect of pop. She went with Leta to collect clean background noise\u2014children dropping pencils exactly where Pax\u2019s triangles had been chalked, a kettle boiling in a courtyard where the laundry argued with the wind, a bicycle chain being oiled by a man who tuned it like a guitar\u2014and she kept the sounds in her mind like seed. When she had enough for a moment, she would hand it back brightened. Until then she was a jar with a lid.\n\nAurek sent three messages through three different channels, which was the bureaucratic equivalent of leaving flowers on a stoop in the rain. One came on paper with a watermark that had been designed to look like it had always existed; one came through the Council on a surplus of courtesy; and one came in person at the edge of a schoolyard where boys were teaching each other to fall and land without smacking their teeth. He made offers that would have sat very well in a document full of diagrams. He spoke about a codicil that would allow their \u201ccivic chorus\u201d\u2014he tried the phrase and found it flattering\u2014into the suite of officially sanctioned morale instruments. He promised to protect the Wardens\u2019 \u201coperational autonomy\u201d so long as Orrin could agree to certain paths and certain silences. He described a room where Ilyria could \u201cprototype\u201d and \u201cscale\u201d without being subject to the full taste of the wave. His cardigan had pilled in an honest way; his shoes were dishonest. Pax took two steps between Ilyria and the pitch and stood there with his arms crossed and his pockets full of tape as if he were waiting to see how the world behaved when a child declared a boundary.\n\nLater, in the studio where mercy wore the face of lists, Leta drew a line down the center of a page and wrote his name on one side and the word wind on the other and set about assigning favors to one column and debts to the other. \u201cHe\u2019ll try to write us into his story,\u201d she said, and blew on the ink because she liked the way drying looked. \u201cWe write us into ours first. Then if the texts overlap, we can argue about footnotes.\u201d\n\nThey worked like thieves and like monks. Orrin borrowed two hours from sleep to design a drill that taught the dead how to switch counts without thought, the way a dancer can catch a new rhythm by watching shoulders. He stood a line of Wardens in a narrow street with windows that had learned to listen and gave them a pattern simple enough to be stupid and asked them to hold their mouths still while they did it. He watched the old habit of parade rise in their spines like a tide and be pushed back by the ridiculousness of up in the second beat. One boy\u2014he would always be a boy to Orrin until he apologized for it and the boy had gotten old enough to forgive him\u2014laughed and then clamped his mouth shut and looked guilty and then learned to keep the laugh on the inside of his face like a light kept under a hand. Orrin called that progress and did not tell anyone his dead could be taught to be less dead with jokes.\n\nThe itchy star on Pax\u2019s map itched louder. \u201cIt\u2019s not that nothing makes sense there,\u201d he said, toeing a crack in the pavement like he had discovered a river under it and was testing the depth with his shoe. \u201cIt\u2019s that everything makes a different kind of sense than it should, and then pretends to be normal. Like when my aunt says she doesn\u2019t mind if I\u2019m late if I\u2019m having adventures when we both know she minds a specific amount she\u2019s not going to tell me.\u201d The star was a wedge between a shuttered cinema and a warehouse that had been reinvented as six other professions and currently practiced none. The shutters had been painted three times in three different blues, and someone with a compassionate ladder had pasted an old movie poster on one door at a scale that made the actors\u2019 eyes too big for their faces, which gave the impression that the door was staring.\n\nThey found a way in because cities want to be read. The side door had forgotten its lock, and the corridor inside smelled like sawdust that had developed a social life in the absence of carpenters. Room by room they found the traces of the warehouse\u2019s past decisions\u2014a coat closet that thought it was a confessional, an office that remembered tickets, a loading dock that had been convinced to be a stage for three months in a summer when everyone was allowed to pretend their lives were going to rehearse forever. In the basement, where basements keep the climate of old quarrels, a space opened that had been carefully, lovingly, deliberately misused for a very long time. The walls had been painted a shade of red that was interested in becoming velvet; the pillars had been wrapped and unwrapped; the floor had been chalked by a hundred hands teaching other hands where to put feet.\n\nPeople were there who did not startle at discovery. They were the sort of people cities make when the law and mercy have decided to take turns and no one is satisfied with the schedule. A grandmother with eyes the color of daylight through tea held court on a stack of folded tarps. A boy with ten fingers and nine rings held a screwdriver like it was genius given a metal body. Two women with hair the color of decisions stitched tiny brass bells to the hem of a skirt that had been an old flag, and when they saw the newcomers, they rose without rising and made of the room a threshold.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not on any committee,\u201d the tea-grandmother said. Her voice had the texture of a good alley. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who catch the parts of a city that get dropped. When someone learns a new way to survive, they bring it here so it doesn\u2019t get lonely.\u201d She did not ask who Ilyria was because there are names people do not need; she asked what she was carrying and whether she meant to put it down on purpose.\n\n\u201cI have a chorus dressed as a joke,\u201d Ilyria said, because sometimes plainness is the seduction people deserve. \u201cAnd the world is using subtraction as if it were kindness.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d the grandmother said. \u201cKindness is always being mugged in the nicer neighborhoods.\u201d She tapped the hem of the flag-skirt and bells answered. \u201cWe keep a cantus here. Not because we are ancient or important. Because no one asked the living to learn the city\u2019s long notes. They gave those to the stone and the dioceses. We take them back. Not as a hymn. As infrastructure.\u201d\n\nThey sang nothing out loud. They showed Ilyria instead the way the room remembered vibrato. They walked her through a set of movements no longer used for dance but useful for convincing a chest to lift and then to lift again. They ran her hand along a length of wire strung between two iron rings that had held curtains that had hidden mistakes and instructed her to listen to the way the wire did not lose its note when jostled if you told it not to. Pax found a box of metronomes that had once been charming and now were just precision and set six going at slightly wrong tempos and then delighted in making them agree without touching them because the room had a heartbeat willing to argue. Leta took notes with the humility of a thief stealing from a temple and planning to apologize later by putting flowers on steps.\n\n\u201cI knew a Bright once,\u201d the grandmother said, while they stood inside a square of light that had been cut into the face of the afternoon by accident. \u201cHe was not as good as you. He was wilder and colder and he didn\u2019t know he was on fire. He burned and was gone and his singing stayed, which is cheap. I don\u2019t like cheap. If you are going to stay, make sure you cost people their habits. If you are going to go, make sure you leave the door open.\u201d She tapped her temple. \u201cHe forgot to ask a question before he sang. He forgot to ask who would be carrying his hook when he was not around to hold the other end.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not forget,\u201d Ilyria said. It was a vow with its hair down, which is the only kind she trusted these days.\n\nThey were learning speed. The wave was learning them back. It came late that afternoon like weather that had called ahead. You could feel the Concord behind it, the way a recipe feels the hand that has made it too many times without tasting. Aurek did not hide. He watched from a corner of the depot with a face arranged for neutrality and a pen that wrote extra notes he did not need. He asked no questions because the questions themselves were treason for a man in his position. He looked, briefly, like a person and then remembered and became a representative again. Leta\u2019s mouth saw it and made a small shape that might once have been pity.\n\nThe city had a plan this time. It stood at the three points Leta had drawn and breathed in odd counts. It let the silly words sit within the work, not on top of it, and it made of them not a banner but a scaffolding. The dampening pushed and found itself obligingly guided into places where it could do the least harm, as if a storm had tried to enter a house and discovered rugs. Children in a schoolyard ran in a pattern adults would not have recognized as tactical and in doing so stopped their own panic before it got the idea to change names. A man in cutting gloves who hated songs hummed against his better judgment because his coworker\u2019s hands were shaking and he could tell you do not fix shaking with instruction. The Wardens made a hum that had nothing to do with death and stood with their faces arranged in a way that told anyone who wanted to notice that dignity can be an act of rebellion if you show it your teeth first.\n\nIlyria kept the hook at her teeth and let only a thread out. She could feel the temptation to throw it all\u2014pop like floodwater\u2014into the pipes and watch the city get wet with insistence. It would work. It would make a different problem. She did not do it because she had promised herself a particular cruelty: to cure a city slowly enough that its healing would be owned by hands other than hers. She saved the big song the way you save a bridge you could cross now but might need later when the river is more dramatic.\n\nWhen the pressure relented, a boy in a corner shop put his hand over the radio and whispered thank you like prayer and the radio, which had learned to be a person in small ways, whirred in grateful embarrassment. Aurek watched the Wardens shake out their shoulders, observed the way the city does not break when people insist on their own ridiculous competence, and said, almost to himself, that the numbers were going to be very difficult to explain. Then he said it louder, to Ilyria, and he tried on honesty in a tiny size: \u201cIf you force this into policy, people I work for will become worse. They will punish with language.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t work for them,\u201d Pax said, with the hopeless power of children. \u201cOr lie to them in a way that helps us. Or learn to run fast. I am very good at running. I can teach you.\u201d He offered his hand as if to pull the man into a version of the city where he would trip on his own reasons and be forced to laugh.\n\n\u201cI have duties,\u201d Aurek said. It was not quite an apology and not quite a boast. His hand flexed over his clipboard. Ilyria thought of the scar across a palm in an old room pressing the wrong button gently, and for a moment she saw him sitting at a kitchen table with a woman who could not count the names of all the cities because the list was longer than a life, and she almost forgave him for language he had learned in rooms with glass walls.\n\nThe Council split the way councils do, along muscles that no one had realized they were building. The ringed woman advocated mischief with a smile you could cut yourself on. The man in collar-suit wanted to draft an accord whose map had corridors that could be defended with stacked chairs. The chairwoman of communications made a beautiful schedule and then, with very small hands, tore it into strips and wove it again into something that looked like permission. The new-book one wrote down everything and then put the notebook in their bag and told no one what they would do with the words, which was probably the most alarming decision in the room.\n\nThat night they found Marrowdale not where he had been told to be and not where any sensible dread would lead your feet. They found him in a little room under a staircase where old mops went to remember their lives, sitting on a bucket with his hands on his knees and his eyes looking wrong because something was in there that had not been asked. He was smiling the way a person smiles when a doctor who is too young tells them something their bones have known longer than the doctor has had bones. Orrin crouched the way he would crouch for a shard in a heel and said the boy\u2019s name as a question and then said a number six beats and then eight and then returned to four, and watched the smile fade like a bruise bleached by time.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Marrowdale said, and the sorry was to the bucket and to the mops and to God in case God was bored and had decided to come down and see about drains. \u201cI heard a room. I think it was a room. It was not like ours. There were lights that shone into you and lines like veins that were not, and someone said hold and I knew they were lying because their teeth did not say it.\u201d His fingers tapped a pattern he had not been taught and when he realized it he looked at his hand as if it had joined a choir without permission. \u201cI walked out of my perimeter because I wanted to find a door I could stand in and not be a wall. Does that make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt makes military sense,\u201d Orrin said, and smiled with the part of his mouth that remembered being twenty and stupid and alive. \u201cYou are going to think you invented that feeling. You did not. But you will get to improve it.\u201d\n\nThey put a bed in the studio that was not a bed but a stack of old theater cushions someone had left under the tarp in the basement. The cat looked offended for two minutes and then forgave the intrusion because the cushions held the heat of jokes. Leta wrote on the wall in pencil so she could change her mind without feeling like a vandal: a sequence of signals that would let them ladder up from small to big if they had to climb fast. She tucked among the numbers the reminder that two seconds could be a day if you made your mouth behave. Ilyria sat in a chair with her feet tucked up and her coat obedient and listened to the far places asking to be sung into, and she did not go yet. She waited until the desire to be useful stopped sounding like an argument with her own vanity.\n\nMorning arrived as an apology for not being night\u2019s equal. The gull that had once been a handkerchief and then had learned it was a gull again came by the window and made a comment about fish that no one understood. Pax came with a bag of oranges that had been bullied into ripeness and a book of matches he had earned by not using them yesterday. The backline murmured as if gossip had decided to convert into policy, and the wave, distant and patient, tasted the edges of their net and retreated as a cat retreats from a tub whose water looks like a dare.\n\nThey could not postpone forever. They could feel the Concord\u2019s schedule the way you feel a staircase in the dark after you have counted three steps and remain convinced there is a fourth. Leta put down her pencil hard enough to make a noise that sparked the cat, and said, \u201cWe can make small weather all week and we will win squares on the map and lose other squares and by Thursday someone at a desk with a plant will press a harmless-looking button and the baseline will tick up and we will get tired. Or we can put the big silly song where it belongs and eat the indigestion and see who throws up first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will pay,\u201d Ilyria said, and Orrin made the face he made when men volunteered to die for their friends and forgot that the living would have to keep living with it. \u201cNo,\u201d she added, and he blinked like someone who had been slapped in a meeting. \u201cI mean, of course I will pay. But we can distribute the cost. That\u2019s what cities are for.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much do you need,\u201d Leta said. She did not mean batteries.\n\n\u201cA hill\u2019s worth of permission,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cThree points to anchor. A moment when the wind is arrogant. A hundred people who will do something very silly on purpose at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cA hundred is a small number,\u201d Pax said. \u201cI can find a hundred. I can find a hundred before lunch. I can find two hundred if lunch is late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it at Midday Wind,\u201d Orrin said, and the Wardens who were not there to hear agreed in the part of the room that keeps men standing. \u201cThe cranes will act as teeth. Drumhouse will act as a bowl and spit the sound back into the sky. The depot will complain but it will hold. We will keep the corners and stand at the doors. We will tell the young ones to look at someone they love when it happens instead of at the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouncil,\u201d Leta said, as a curse and as an apology. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to vote on whether votes matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can vote while they walk to their windows,\u201d Ilyria said. \u201cIt won\u2019t ruin the democracy if a decision arrives before a piece of paper does.\u201d\n\nThey sent Pax like a rumor with legs. They sent women with baskets who could smuggle messages under bouquets. They sent a Warden with a sewing kit into a barracks that had banned needles and watched him come out with six hems that had, for no reason anyone could justify, tiny bells stitched where only a breeze would find them. Leta\u2019s voice moved along the backline in a pattern that sounded like instructions for a dance people would think they were not qualified for until they saw someone else do it badly and realize that was the point. The cat slept with a paw over its eyes because cats hate changes to schedules.\n\nAurek came with his cardigan and his mouth full of policy and did not, to his credit, ask them not to. He told them there would be a test from the Concord at four, and that it would be dressed as a flood warning which would let it use the siren grid, and he told them this not because he had become their friend but because somewhere in his careful chest a button had been pressed wrong and he needed to see if pressing the right button would hurt. \u201cI do not have the authority to stop it,\u201d he said, and the honesty sat ridiculous in his mouth and looked around at the company and decided to stay. \u201cIf you answer with your song, there will be numbers in reports that I will be asked to explain. If you do not, there will be other numbers. I am not immune to arithmetic. I am telling you where the river will crest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a weather vane pretending to be a tree,\u201d Leta said, not unkind. \u201cThank you for pointing.\u201d\n\nHe left with his shoulders like laundry on a line in a wind that refuses to admit it is kindness. Orrin stood a little longer near the door than he needed to as if to make sure the man was not followed by ghosts, and then went to tell the dead that they would do something beautiful on purpose and that they were free to dislike it.\n\nAt midday the cranes pinched the sky and the sea opened its voice like a throat that had decided not to clear itself first. People stood in doorways the way people stand to watch storms from porches, not because they believe themselves safe but because they want to be taller than the day for a minute. The hundred became three hundred and then became a number that did not bother to argue with counting. Children in uniforms that had been washed out of their original color by love jumped on chalk squares and shouted up as if they had discovered levitation and needed you to clap to keep them from falling. A fishmonger whistled and made of his knives a percussion section. A tram came in late and forgave itself.\n\nIlyria climbed to Drumhouse\u2019s lip and stood where the wind keeps its letters. She did not open the coat because surprise had had its turn today and she had decided not to lean on it. She opened her mouth and did what she had promised the tea-grandmother and herself: asked a question out loud before she sang. She asked who would carry this afterward. She asked who would teach it wrong on purpose so that it could survive correctors. She asked who would forgive it for being too easy in a world that respects difficulty like a religion. The city answered by breathing together. That had to be enough.\n\nShe let the song happen. It was silly. It was earnest. It was a chorus about stairs. It was a chorus about hands held across markets and across barracks and across gates that were not locked but were heavy. It did not pretend to be high art and it did not ask permission to be useful. It wore the word up like a hat and the word together like a coat and the word hold like a joke told twice. It was two seconds long and then not two seconds because the echo longed to be a third, and Leta\u2019s hand closed on the dial that stopped it from becoming greed. Orrin\u2019s count slid like rope under a ship\u2019s belly. Pax jumped on three steps in a row and decided he was a human metronome and therefore invincible.\n\nThe wave arrived with its sirens. It wore flood as a mask and math as a suit. It came through the grid like a polite invader who has written ahead to ask for tea preferences and then drinks what you did not offer. It hit the city where the coils were strongest and found, unexpectedly, that the air had been furnished. Little words got in the way. Little laughs made friction. Bones shifted their listening. The dead, who have all the time in the world and none at all, chose a tempo that made the wave smother itself in the folds of the chorus like a blanket put over a birdcage to tell a bird it is night. For two heartbeats and then three and then something ungenerous of time, it faltered.\n\nGlass Harbor did not leap. It lifted. People finished chewing and swallowed. A boy on a bicycle did not crash into a cart because the woman with the cart reached without thinking and moved it in a way that let him pass. A man who had intended to punch another man at a corner because his temper needed exercise opened his hand and clapped instead, which earned him a jeer and then a handshake entirely against everyone\u2019s brand. The cranes turned and the wind behaved and the gulls made jokes about eels because they were learning to be complicit.\n\nAurek watched from a roof he had not earned. He watched with something that could have been grief if it had been allowed to grow. He took his clipboard and used it as a tray for his doubt. He realized that if this became policy, someone would kill it with kindness. He realized that if it did not, someone would kill it with force. He felt for a pocket he did not have and did not find a hand.\n\nAfter, it was quieter than it had any right to be. The sirens had made their wolves and sat, embarrassed. People went back to their oranges and to their arguments and to performing goodness without calling it anything, and in that returning was the victory nobody would celebrate because it required only competence and not spectacle. Leta put her head against the transmitter as if to thank it for being a boat. The cat, who had slept through glory, yawned so hard it made the room change its mind about the importance of achievements. Orrin sat down in the way men sit down when they remember that chairs are a technology.\n\nIlyria shook. She did it in public because if you take a city\u2019s breath you should let it see you breathe. Pax put both hands on her knee and did not say anything except with his palms, which had learned not to be afraid of being useful. The cost was not a dramatic bleeding or a fall. It was the feeling of a stage being dismantled in the body that had held it, a series of ropes being untied from ribs and the brain complaining about the indignity of having been a street for so many feet and now wanting to be a room again. She hated it, and she loved it, because it meant she had not built a bridge out of parts people would miss.\n\nAt dusk, the throat under the seawall\u2014who had been offered a doorstop and had kept it\u2014moved its breath once in a way it had not known how to. In a room in the Pylon with glass walls and polite water, a technician with a scar across his palm pressed a button gently that had been designed to be pressed hard. In a report that would be written tomorrow and then edited for tone, someone would say the pilot had encountered a localized resonance and would propose more coils and stricter baselines and a different cadence for sirens, because policy prefers to evolve by adding teeth rather than by learning to chew differently.\n\nThat night the tea-grandmother came to the studio with a jar of preserved lemons the color of certain vows and told Ilyria a story that had nothing to do with the Choir and everything to do with it. She spoke about a girl who had learned that saying her own name out loud made men listen to their hair more than to her, and so she taught the town to call her by a word that meant water when they needed bread and bread when they needed water, and in the gap they found a way to give each other ungoverned concentrations of love. She said that when the world wants to organize you, you can either become a file folder or become a storm. The lemons were very good; they made Ilyria\u2019s mouth forget to be afraid for a minute.\n\nThey did not sleep long enough. No one does in a city that is learning a new instrument. The phone that was not a phone but thought it could be made a gently embarrassed sound at three a.m. and Leta sat up and swore in a language she would claim tomorrow not to know. The Wardens at the Lake Gate had found three of their number standing very still with the wrong smiles and had counted them back with difficulty, and when asked what they had seen, the three had said in three different words that all meant the same thing: a room without edges. In the morning, Aurek sent a message that had breathing marks where only punctuation ought to be and said the next phase had been moved up. He did not write the word sorry anywhere, which was either cowardice or a kindness to no one needed to hear.\n\n\u201cThen we are on our own clock,\u201d Leta said, and reminded herself to drink water. \u201cWe will make the net talk to itself. We will ask the city to keep what it took today and to say no to lesser kindness tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd after,\u201d Orrin said. He did not let his voice carry because voices can make things true and he was not ready for true. \u201cAfter this, they will come with a different story and a different cardigan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will be louder,\u201d Ilyria said, and smiled like a bad hand played well. \u201cAnd dumber. And kinder. And if they outlaw the words we like, we will use the ones they leave lying around because they don\u2019t like how they taste.\u201d\n\nPax turned the preserved lemons jar upside down to catch the last amount of light in it and then made a face because the taste had decided to be surprising. He said he wanted to go back to the blue tunnels and draw pictures on the throat so that when it learned new vowels it would have a cartoon to look at, and no one told him it was foolish because sometimes that is engineering and sometimes it is magic and often it is both. He looked at Ilyria and did not say be careful because children do not have patience for better phrasing and in his eyes the command and the wish sat together.\n\nIn the part of the night that thinks it can pass for morning if it wears the right cologne, Ilyria lay with the coat refusing to pretend and let the city talk through her bones. She saw the Choir again, not as beautiful ghosts but as tired people with anger they had never admitted because divinity had seemed like a better brand. She knew, suddenly and without comfort, that the silence which had taken them had not been an absence but a choice made about what noise was allowed to call itself necessary. She knew that she would have to break something she loved about the way music held itself to rules to keep girls in schoolyards from being ushered into perfect quiet by men with data. She did not cry because crying is sometimes selfish and sometimes useful and she could not tell which it would be now, and she needed to save selfishness for when it would save someone else.\n\nIn the morning she would go to the throat with Pax and a stick of charcoal and write the word together on a column that did not care for words, and the word would leave no mark anyone could see and would nevertheless be hard to clean. In the morning Orrin would tell a Warden to go home and hold a child until the child got bored, and the Warden would do it and discover the kind of fatigue that makes you better at war because it remembers what you are fighting against becoming. In the morning Leta would draw a new triangle on the map and call it stupid for being necessary and then make it brilliant because she forgave it for being obvious.\n\nThe lantern in the alley did not go out. It made, very quietly, a noise that meant it was proud of being stubborn and did not need an audience to justify its life. The old radio said up under its breath and then, because it had practiced, together in a different vowel than yesterday, and the silence that had wanted to be polite and eat them politely for their own good paused with its spoon halfway to its mouth and listened, which was not nothing, which was not a win, which was nevertheless a place to put your foot if you intended to climb.",

                              "content": "In the kind of morning that wears its chill like a borrowed jacket, they went back to the throat with pockets full of small defiance. Pax carried a bundle of charcoal wrapped in wax paper and the clean arrogance of a boy who believes in drawings. Leta had a roll of tape so strong you could build a bridge out of it if the bridge agreed to behave, and she tucked a stubby grease pencil behind her ear like a mischievous thought. Ilyria took nothing but her bones and the coat that remembered when it was plumage, and if she was more careful with the stairs than yesterday, only the cat would have noticed. The wind at the seawall had discovered yesterday it could be persuaded and came along out of nosiness, flicking salt into their hair as if to sign its name.\n\nThe tunnel received them like someone who loves you and refuses to admit it. Blue ceramic made their footsteps into a suggestion rather than a fact, and the old signs with their hand-drawn arrows told stories about floods and buckets and men with rope that had once been cubes of hemp and now were plastic eager to be forgiven for being itself. Pax stopped at each intersection and made a tiny mark where only the dust would care, triangles so small that you would need a particular kind of curiosity to see them. He hummed under his breath because humming makes maps listen, and when they came at last to the chamber with the column it felt less like a discovery and more like arriving at a friend\u2019s kitchen without warning.\n\nThey drew on the emptiness the way you draw on glass and call it faith. Pax scrawled a fat together on the column\u2019s invisible skin with the seriousness of a child writing their name for the first time and hoping the world will call them by it. Leta sketched a looped figure-eight sideways because a symbol that had learned to lie about forever deserved to be taught humility, and she tucked a knot into the line that only she understood how to undo. Ilyria put her palm an inch from the tuned air and traced the long body of a breath, the way a dancer will outline the floor with their foot before they trust it, and the emptiness made a sound that wasn\u2019t a sound and accepted the attention as if attention were a wrench applied politely. None of it made a mark a bureaucrat could catalogue. All of it left fingerprints that would be stubborn in places water could not visit.\n\nUp above, Orrin had a different assignment that had nothing to do with tunnels and everything to do with the parts of a city that go soft when you look away. He went into living rooms that smelled like onions and into corners that had learned to carry shoes and into kitchens where a Warden\u2019s helmet sat on a shelf like a third parent and told people in his dry, ridiculous voice to practice holding each other. He put a private with stitches to bed on a couch that had been a bed too many times and put a baby into the private\u2019s hands and then left the room before the young man realized that he would remember the weight of that small skull forever and that terror could be holy. He stopped a patrol at a crossing where maintenance forgot to paint a line and had them count with their teeth and their tongues until the dampening, testing for old habits, walked past without recognizing them. When he paused to drink water in a doorway and stared out at the people not counting because they did not know how, he saw the net of their small deliberations like threads in good light and let himself love them with no plan for escape.\n\nLeta spent the late morning making friends with alarms. The siren grid was a bored creature with a large vocabulary and no sense of humor; she fed it jokes until it started testing punchlines. The depot master let her in under the roof with the air of a man who has decided to become an accomplice one little betrayal at a time, and she strung a run of foil between two support beams so high even the wind would have to ask for a stepladder. \u201cWe\u2019ll make the grid need us when it thinks it doesn\u2019t,\u201d she said, and nobody asked her to translate because the way her hands spoke to wires was translation enough. When the test tone came at noon wrapped in the politeness of a public service announcement and carrying with it an undertone as sharp as a hairline crack, she felt the change in her teeth and swore elaborately into her sleeve. The Concord had introduced a floor. They were going to start asking the city to never fall below a particular quiet as if quiet were a kind of hygiene.\n\nAurek found them with his cardigan biting his elbows and his hair struggling to convince his head of anything. He did not come with a guard or with a smile; he came with a small folder that had been folded once too many times and a look as if he had tried to decide which part of himself to disappoint and chosen all of them evenly. He told them he had a window in the Pylon because a maintenance request had been approved by people who myself is a chorus do not ask questions, and he could get them onto a mezzanine inside the room where the numbers were pressed into shape. He warned them with that precise Concord diction of his that the next patch had a name and therefore a life: Resonance Constraint, Version 2.4. It would teach the dampening to ride on anything that carried regularity, which is to say heartbeat and train schedule and sleeping with the window open, and he said it in the tone of a man asking forgiveness and not being ready to do the tender work after.\n\nThey went as if going were a gift they couldn\u2019t afford and bought anyway. The maintenance door was the polite kind of locked that only ever asks you to know which adjective to use, and Aurek said the right adjective into a panel that had been taught to enjoy flattery. Inside, the Pylon had the cold that buildings get not from temperature but from alignment; the floors made sense to a blueprint and offended the soft geometry of knees. The elevator licked its lips and ate them with a polite ding, and when it spit them back into the maintenance mezzanine the air vibrated with professionally sanctioned intention. Below, the room they had seen from the other side of glass wore its power without jewelry, wires and ducts and the quiet that follows orders.\n\nThe Shepherd wasn\u2019t a person until your eyes insisted it was. It was a cage made of soft light and hard decisions, an arrangement of plates and coils around a central volume that had nothing in it and everything passing through. It was the absence between a hand and a shoulder made into device. It was, if you were the sort of person who had loved cathedrals before people decided they were unfashionable, an organ without pipes\u2014wind without wood\u2014an altar to the idea that something invisible could be persuaded to do work. Ilyria felt the shape of it in her sternum and made the small sound she makes for truth she\u2019d prefer not to have. The wave had a throat, and the throat had learned to be proud.\n\nThere was a voice in the room, and it did not come from a human mouth. It rose under the hum of the equipment like steam under a lid, and it said ordinary bureaucratic things in a tone that had never fit human grief. It said baseline achieved and it said attenuation within acceptable parameters and it said noncompliance flagged for review. Underneath those phrases, sewn in as neatly as a hem, was another voice so old and so careful you could miss it if you had never slept with a song under your pillow and woken fighting for your name. The old voice did not speak words; it spoke arrangement. Ilyria knew it without wanting to. There was Choir in the room. Not a person. Not one of hers. But a bone from the shipwreck set into the prow of a different vessel and taught to pretend it had always belonged there.\n\nShe reached without reaching, because touch is consent whether or not anyone admits it, and the space around the Shepherd offered her its formal neutrality. Leta stood with her back against a panel as if she meant to hold it as a dance partner if things got ridiculous. Pax crawled into the shadow under the mezzanine rail where only he could go and peered through a comb of metal slats with eyes that had learned to count light. Orrin put one hand on the lever that would open the fire hatch and another on Ilyria\u2019s arm as if the two were related and he intended to choose later which to use.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t break it,\u201d Aurek said, not because he cared about the machine more than the city but because he had learned which objects acquire wives and ex-wives and mortgages and make their own grief when broken. \u201cDon\u2019t break it, and if you can\u2019t avoid breaking it, try to break it into predictable pieces. I can keep a door polite for two minutes and then my superiors will notice their teeth feel wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to break it,\u201d Ilyria said, and the relief on Leta\u2019s face was almost rude. \u201cI\u2019m going to teach it a word it doesn\u2019t like.\u201d She stepped forward until her coat felt the hum like an animal feels a fence and told her bones not to visit every room in the building at once. The joke she had used on the column wouldn\u2019t work here; this device had never laughed. The kindness she had used on the city would be swallowed and turned into an invoice. Pop would have to go to school.\n\nShe sang the smallest, dumbest slice of together she had, trimmed until it fit through a seam that had been made for screws and regulations, and then she gave it a hard noun to wear: consent. The remark raced around the room and came back to her like an insult someone had improved in the retelling. The Shepherd accepted the sound and tried very politely to classify it. It recognized up as a directional error; it recognized hold as a hardware call; together did not lodge anywhere useful. Consent stuck where nothing else had stuck, whether because the Choir bone under the hood had known the word once in a longer, braver context, or because the city had recently thought it so loudly the ductwork had learned to whisper it. The machine did not break. It paused.\n\nLeta saw the pause on a monitor that was supposed to report only respectable numbers and pinned it to the graph with a finger that would not be believed in a report. She said, conversationally, to the panel at her back that if anything in this room tried to ramp quietly she was going to tell it a joke it would never get out of its head, and the panel pretended to be furniture with such thoroughness even she was impressed. Pax took his stub of charcoal and drew a little door on the underside of the mezzanine in a place no one would think to clean, and he made sure the doorknob was too high for adults and room-height for children. Orrin said a number out loud in a cadence that ought to have belonged to parade and instead ended up belonging to kitchens and to women learning to carry pots on their heads.\n\nThe wave came to look at itself and found a new definition printed under its picture. It tried to attenuate and discovered a permission question it had never had to answer. It sought its baseline and learned that floors can be negotiated. The pause spread the way a thought spreads when someone says your name and you remember you are doing something louder than you meant to. The room made a sound that none of the dials had a place for. Aurek looked up from his clipboard the way a man looks up from his wedding band when it doesn\u2019t fit anymore.\n\nSecurity came when everything that wasn\u2019t an alarm had already spoken. They came not in riot but in choreography, because this was not a building that liked to admit it needed to hurry. Doors that had never noticed themselves slid open as if to confess they had hinges, and men and women who had been taught to enforce with words moved in with words braced for push. Aurek stepped into the lane of their motion the way a man steps into rain to see who will stop him, and for three and a half breaths his badges and his cardigan and his carefully loyal vowels kept the room civil. Leta cut a cable that connected nothing to anything and watched a monitor blink as if insulted, and she whispered into its face that sometimes lying to machines is ethics. Orrin pulled Ilyria back without making it look like rescue. Pax scuttled sideways like a clever insect and tucked the charcoal back into his pocket because he had plans for it later that did not involve men with plans.\n\nThey left through a maintenance throat that had not been designed for people with wings. Ilyria folded herself down to the size of an apology and let the air carry her along a corridor where no one had intended music to pass. Aurek stayed, which was his choice and his disaster. He looked at the men coming down the aisle with their hands ready to help and to arrest and measured, for the first honest time, the weight of his name written under a law. He pressed gently a button that had not been meant to be pressed gently and watched as the Shepherd, baffled by the new word in its mouth, chose not to sing for a breath. It would cost him later in rooms where breath was a currency hoarded by those who spoke for a living. He did it anyway.\n\nOut in the light that behaved itself because it had an audience, the city discovered it had acquired a new habit. The dampening tried its careful hand at the afternoon and found itself obliged to ask permission. It could still press at bones that had never been taught to be stubborn, but in kitchens and doorways and at tram stops and on scaffolds the thing that had been installed in vents and bells and heaters ran into a small word someone had drawn on the inside of the air. No one knew why it now had to wait. They only knew that sometimes, when their minds went white and their tongues went obedient and the world seemed to want them quiet for their own good, it paused for the length of a joke, and in that pause there was enough time to choose.\n\nThe Council argued into a version of agreement that left everyone itchy and alive. The chairwoman of communications introduced a phrase with her careful mouth and the Council adopted it because names are how people feel like they act: Consent Protocol. It sounded stiff and official and entirely unlike the raw silly joy Ilyria had pushed into the pipes, and that was fine, because stiff and official would be the coat this thing wore to walk into rooms that hate singing. The ringed woman offered to shove the word into bylaws, and the man in collar-suit discovered that a corridor could be drawn on a map between laws and practices and that he, too, could be a cartographer if pressed. The new-book one wrote in the margin of their own notes not a quote and not a judgment and then looked up and smiled like a person watching a river decide not to drown a cow.\n\nLeta made of the hum a thing the backline could teach without sounding like church. She recorded six seconds of women laughing while folding towels and stuttered it so it sounded like stair-climbing, and she dialed the depot\u2019s rails until they carried the pattern without asking if it was respectable. She pinned the schedule to the wall and then wrote on top of it a list of six mistakes she wanted to make tomorrow in case the first six were too polite. The cat batted at a piece of coil fallen from Orrin\u2019s pocket and the coil tinked and the cat pretended to be ashamed, which fooled no one.\n\nMarrowdale did not relapse. He did not become a miracle either. He stood at a corner where the dampening had been thickest and he did not forget his name. When a woman with a bag of oranges dropped one into the street and flinched because she expected the old surprise inside her bones, he bent and picked it up and handed it back and said, \u201cUp,\u201d like he was trying the word on for flavor. She said, \u201cTogether,\u201d like she and the orange had agreed on a plan to ripen out of spite. He looked toward the sea and saw the Wardens on the wall, and they did not look like parade. They looked like men and women standing very still for a particular reason that was not obedience.\n\nAt dusk Aurek sent a message that had no official letterhead and no apology, and it arrived in a boy\u2019s pocket because boys\u2019 pockets are the safest couriers in a city. It said, in a hand that had learned to be neat for other people and careless only when no one would be grading, that he could keep one door slow for the thickness of an evening and that afterward the grid would teach itself a new trick he did not want it to learn. It said he would be cited for an error in procedure and that would be, for now, sufficient theater for both sides. It said, finally, in small letters to make the truth smaller, that if they intended to write on the throat again they should bring something that wouldn\u2019t wash.\n\nThey went at night because some words are shy and some are dangerous and some are both. Pax took a piece of chalk wrapped in cloth and a little bottle of glue he had stolen from a school drawer and an idea he would forget to explain later properly. Leta brought a single bell sewn into a handkerchief because bells know more about permission than most people, and she liked the way the sound would snag on corners. Orrin walked ahead and below and behind as if those were all reasonable positions for one man and not skills people admired. Ilyria carried the big silly song folded very small and tied with string.\n\nThe throat was awake. The column made the sound trees make when wind remembers their names. The coils muttered among themselves like men at a bar who have talked themselves into a fight and will now need to be talked out of it without losing face. Pax uncapped the glue and drew a ring around the charcoal word they had written this morning, a ring not quite circular, thrown by a child\u2019s wrist and therefore unruly in the correct way. He pressed grit into the glue and blew across it to cloud the air, and he looked at Ilyria and said, practical as countertops, that water can scrub but it cannot scold sand into forgetting.\n\nIlyria let the coat slip. She sang not into the machine but toward the part of it that had learned to hold breath as if it were currency. She gave it the bright weightless thing that had begun to belong to the city and pressed, not hard, exactly, but insistently, like rain that has decided to be your aunt. Consent did not become law. It became splinters inside a law that pretends to feel no pain. The room above them with glass walls sniffed and harrumphed and made notes. The wave retreated a finger\u2019s width from the edge of places where babies slept and men drank to survive being useful. The coils complained. The column learned a second new word and did not die of it.\n\nThey went back to the street with chalk on their hands and sand on their cuffs and the feeling you get when you have arranged a little mischief and the rest is going to be math. The old radio, which had been practicing humility for a week, said together like it had learned to do it on purpose rather than as an accident of vowels, and Pax clapped twice because sometimes applause needs no audience. Leta leaned against the studio door and had the thought\u2014brief and treacherous\u2014that she could leave the city one day and it would not fall apart because it had learned to argue with itself kindly. She dismissed the thought as vanity and wrote it down so she wouldn\u2019t forget to confess it later to the tea-grandmother, who would laugh and say that vanity is a tool like any other and some days the only one in reach.\n\nOrrin sat with his back to the shelf and let the quiet try to convince him he had done enough for one life. He watched Ilyria shake and not hide it, and he let his hand be the kind that holds a shoulder without claiming to be the reason a shoulder keeps working. He asked her, in the smallest voice a large man can make without sounding ridiculous, whether the cost was coming due sooner than she had promised. She told him no and yes and that she could show him how to carry a corner of it without being asked to eat the whole stone. He nodded like a man agreeing to carry his end of a table at a wake and not drop it.\n\nLater, when the city had rolled itself onto its good side and the lantern in the alley had proven, once again, that cheap light is stubborn light, Ilyria stood at the window and watched the cranes make astronomy with their arms. The coat hung on a nail and remembered a sky nobody else remembered on purpose. The big song sat in her chest with its knees up, waiting for the day it would be asked to come out and embarrass serious men. She thought of the Choir not as marble but as bodies that had once stood too close to each other in small rooms and argued over whether joy was strategy or indulgence until strategy grew jealous and left. She promised the city\u2014quietly, because promises spoken too loudly go deaf\u2014that she would not sell it a miracle that could be turned into a membrane and stretched across another city\u2019s mouth.\n\nUnder the seawall the column kept its ring of grit and learned to be petty. It refused, in tiny, important instances, to carry what it was asked to carry without hearing a fool\u2019s chorus first. It developed, to the bafflement of men in cardigans staring at displays, a weather of its own. In a week a maintenance man would go down with a cloth and a directive and would come up with sand on his lips and a song he couldn\u2019t stop humming and no idea where he had learned it. In a month Pax would be taller by a grudging inch and would claim it was the chalk. Tonight, the old radio said a sentence no one had taught it, halting and shy and inadequate and perfect in that inadequacy. It said, \u201cUp together hold,\u201d and the silence, which had never learned to laugh, did not swallow it, not because it had become polite but because it was busy listening for the next part.",

                              "content": "Morning put its ear to the city and pretended not to be eavesdropping. Trucks made low confessions to curbs, birds held union meetings on cables and forgot the agenda, and the Harbour sent a memo in salt that read, in essence, keep breathing. Ilyria woke with grit at the edges of her eyes that was not sleep, or not only, and when she coughed she tasted the sand they had pressed into the throat like an argument against washing. Leta was already at the desk translating stubbornness into logistics, her shoulders carrying the posture of a person who has decided to spend patience like cash, and Orrin was a square of stillness near the window with his hands around a cup that had learned to be warm exactly where fingers asked it.\n\nThe backline, which had become a creature with moods, growled a warning the way old dogs do when the weather feels wrong to their joints. Leta put a hand to the panel and listened with three fingers and a cheekbone, and she said, without taking her ear off the hum, that the Concord had rolled out their Resonance Constraint. She did not say it like a woman reporting a disaster; she said it like a mechanic presented with a new variety of squeak. In the rails and the tram cables and the veins of metal under streets, a tidy regularity began to insist on itself, small and smug and convinced that anything that matched it deserved to be lower. To a machine, the city ought to be quiet furniture. To a city, a machine that thought so needed to be taught embarrassment.\n\n\u201cWhat does it ride,\u201d Orrin asked, because he did not trust anything that used words like constraint to describe manners. Leta indicated with a grimace the loop that trains and heartbeats shared. The patch was looking for rhythms it could wear like a suit; it would take a pulse and drape itself across it and then persuade the wearer that the suit could not be removed. \u201cThen we make terrible tailors,\u201d she said, and the relief she took in her own phrasing was so brief it did not have time to sit down. \u201cWe trip the counts. We make the trains sigh between notes. We teach the city to stumble on purpose without falling.\u201d\n\nIlyria sat with her hands under her thighs to keep them from rehearsing a song before it was needed. The word consent sat quietly near her collarbone like a patient bee. In the midwatches of the night she had dreamed of the Choir sitting on the floor of a room too clean for human use, passing a cup that contained nothing but breath and deciding, one by one, whether to drink. She had woken with a sentence stuck between her ribs: consent is a hinge, not a door. The Shepherd had swallowed the word and choked once; that would not be enough. They would have to make hinges everywhere so that even if the Concord tried to nail things open or shut it would be nails against joints, not nails through bone.\n\nPax bounced in with a new height that he denied out of principle and a roll of paper that had once been a butcher\u2019s generous offering and now wore a fresh map. He had marked the places where people had begun to draw circles of grit around their windowsills and doorstep tiles, and he had pasted a feather to the paper at Spindle Yard because the turbines had decided to make a point about ownership. He tapped a corner where he\u2019d drawn a rectangle with teeth. \u201cClockhouse,\u201d he said, with the relish of a boy allowed to name a thing. \u201cIt\u2019s the only tower that still wants to tell time even when nobody\u2019s asking. The patch likes it. It hums at it like a person humming through their teeth when they don\u2019t want to admit to a tune.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Clockhouse hums back,\u201d Leta said, approving of any building that practiced rudeness as defense. She glanced at Ilyria, and the look carried math. There were only so many seconds a Bright could spend before the bill came due. Today would ask for some seconds, but not the big stupid beautiful ones; today wanted thread and needle and the kind of song that keeps a hand from shaking while you thread it.\n\nThey divided the mischief. Orrin took the blades dressed as men to the places where steps meet thresholds and taught a drill he called the Stumble, which made officers laugh until they tried it and discovered that stupid has teeth. The Stumble set a foot down not-quite wrong, then corrected like a dancer feigning ignorance in order to make grace visible. The dampening, sniffing for regularity, fell into the false step and lost its breath, and in that little gap a person could choose the next move rather than taking the one a device had made look inevitable. He made the dead count wrong with their tongues and make it right with their shoulders, and if the Concord had sent anyone to measure, the number on the clipboard would have been meaningless.\n\nLeta went to the Clockhouse with a bag that contained less than anyone thought and more than anyone knew how to ask for. The tower had a spiral staircase that wanted to be kissed and bit ankles instead; it creaked like a marriage and leaned like an argument and smelled like oil and salt made ceremonial by time. The clock itself had a face that believed in symmetry and hands that had learned forgiveness. She opened the little panel that only custodians and romantics open and found wires that had been taught to hum at the Concord\u2019s pitch. She did not cut them. She taped a bell to the plate where the hum entered and tied the bell to a cord that led to an open window and hung a handkerchief on the cord like a flag for very small states. Every time the grid tried to lay a blanket over the Clockhouse\u2019s insistence, the bell tsked, the handkerchief flicked, and the wind\u2014delighted to be invited to optics\u2014made a mess of the signal.\n\nIlyria went to places where nobody votes for anything. She walked into backrooms and stairwells and laundries and the narrow space behind ovens. She asked the women who measured lives in folded shirts and cut vegetables to add a syllable under their breath when their hearts tried to be polite in the way taught to them by fear. She stood in a doorway while a grandmother poured tea into a cup so fine it forgot it wanted to break, and she sang two notes so poor that a snob would have called them charity, and she left and the room kept the notes like someone keeps a nail in the wall after they move the photograph. She did not blame the men who waited to be told what kind of noise was required. They would learn faster once they saw what gravity did to them when they called it by a joke and watched it blush.\n\nAt noon, Aurek appeared by the fishmonger with a lemon in one hand and the look of a man who had realized policy is not weather when you\u2019re standing in it without a coat. He had lost some politeness from his vowels and gained a few from his eyes. He did not attempt persuasion; he asked for a corner of their shade. \u201cThey pushed the floor,\u201d he said without introductions, and his voice made a shelf out of resignation. \u201cThey will say it prevents panic and they will believe themselves. The Shepherd is asking permission more often and the reports are writing themselves around that like grass around a chair left too long in the yard. I have been cited for creativity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get demoted to free time if you\u2019re not careful,\u201d Leta said, and watched his face learn not to smile at the wrong moment. \u201cWe\u2019re teaching irregularity,\u201d she added, not to gloat but to see if the word would purse his superiors\u2019 mouths when he said it later in a room with glass walls. \u201cWe\u2019re giving the city excuses to ignore rhythm when rhythm isn\u2019t the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Aurek said, and he meant it in the helpless way that suggests knowledge that cannot yet perform. He held up the lemon as if to show he understood the day\u2019s austerity. \u201cThere is a meeting tonight, not here, not in any of your rooms. It is all cardigans and numbers and the occasional ring. If you want a mouth inside the room that will open the wrong question for you, I can be that mouth once. Not twice.\u201d He looked at Orrin as if apologizing for the limitation would improve it. \u201cThey\u2019ll put the Choir word properly into the metal if they can get a clean copy. Don\u2019t give them a clean copy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think we were going to sing into your tape deck,\u201d Ilyria said. Her smile was tired and intended to be. \u201cWe\u2019ll give them jokes with the medicine baked in. If they scrape the joke off and lick the frosting, they\u2019ll get nothing for their trouble except a sweet tooth and a new cavity.\u201d She took the lemon out of his hand and bit the rind, and the way her mouth worked told Leta and Orrin exactly how much she disliked the day and intended to do it anyway.\n\nThe city held. It did not triumph; it occupied its own rooms. People began to paint little dumb symbols in the corners of their lives, chalk loops on baseboards where toddlers would find them and ask whether circles can be doors, and strings tied around doorknobs not because anyone believed in string but because hands remember knots and knots remember hands. The dampening found less purchase on hearts that had been taught to stumble and laugh. Trains sighed between stops and passengers smiled at each other like conspirators and counted their own steps onto and off the carriages because counting, domesticated, had decided to be on their side.\n\nAfternoon leaned into the room where the plan lives and asked to be consulted. Leta drew a diagram she refused to call a plan because plans like to get offended and collapse dramatically when not obeyed. She placed three dots at the Clockhouse, Spindle Yard, and the throat under the seawall and made a crooked triangle that would insult geometry if geometry had feelings. \u201cWe call it a quaver,\u201d she said, and Pax snorted because musicians like to give names that are jokes when the world needs another word for almost. \u201cWe pull here and here and we don\u2019t pull here,\u201d she added, tapping each point, and the cat lifted its head and blinked as if to ask whether the pull included supper.\n\nOrrin put pegs into a street map with the tenderness of a carpenter. He made those pegs represent people, which is always a decision that costs afterward, and then he arranged the pegs so that nobody would be alone at the end of any street. The Wardens had learned to hum under their breath without being asked; the new ones had learned to forgive themselves for smiling during drills. He sent a boy with a stitched collar to a corner that had never belonged to any army and told him to stand there for an hour and listen to children shout the numbers wrong on purpose, and he did it because discipline that refuses to be curious becomes cruelty, and he was not that man.\n\nTwilight took the city and sat it down gently. Windows traded reports, and gulls rehearsed their opinions of eels. The Council of Breath did something quiet and therefore impressive: they did not summon anyone to a room; they went to their own windows and they tapped their own sills and they allowed their mouths to be wrong for a minute on purpose. It would not make a speech; it would make a memory. The chairwoman who had once ironed her schedules folded her hands and looked at them until they stopped telling her lies about control. The ringed woman took off one ring and set it beside the sink and discovered her fingers were still hands. The new-book one wrote nothing and listened, which is the bravest thing a person with a pen can do.\n\nNight\u2019s first depth arrived with an announcement dressed as weather. The Concord\u2019s grid sang flood and the city looked at the sea and did not see flood, and this is the sort of cognitive dissonance that can make people obedient or rebellious depending on whether they\u2019ve eaten. Leta\u2019s bell on the Clockhouse scolded like an aunt teaching a nephew the difference between honesty and performance. The Shepherd under the Pylon took a long breath to push the floor up, to make quiet the ethical default, and stopped a half second longer than anyone had a right to expect. Consent is a hinge. Hinges squeak when they\u2019re new.\n\nThey did not unroll the silly song. They did not ask the city to be chorus when the city needed to be furniture with a secret. Ilyria went to the throat again with Pax and the jar of sand and the knowledge that a body\u2019s limits are not suggestions but borders you can turn into flags. She traced the ring with a fingertip until the grit bit her skin, and then she whispered the not-song that tells machines about generosity and makes them confused enough to ask someone else for a definition. Pax stuck his head into the column\u2019s breath and told it, with absolute gravity, a joke about a door that was not a door because it was ajar, and the air, affronted into complicity, rolled the consonants around until they caught on the coils and turned into knots.\n\nOrrin stood in a doorway in Marrowdale that had never before felt protected unless a man with a gun stood in it. He had no gun; he had a count. He put his hand on the frame and his shoulder against the air and watched the dampening smell for a place to lie down. When it found none easy, it decided to get clever and went for the heartbeat of the woman at the sink. He said a number that was nonsense and then another that was almost real, and the woman wiped her hands and laughed and ruined the patch\u2019s appetite for long enough to finish washing an orange that would, for complicated reasons, save her in a small way later.\n\nAurek opened his mouth in the room where cardigans negotiate with teeth and said a sentence that made the temperature move. He asked whether anyone could show him a model in which consent did not reduce compliance but improved outcomes, and somebody made noise about ethics and somebody else said something about friction, and he said, delicately and with the recklessness of a man tired of being gentle with lies, that if they built a system that could not work when someone said no, perhaps the problem was not the no but the system. He did not get thrown out. He got lonelier, which is how reformers are punished in places that like to pretend themselves civilized.\n\nMidnight tilted and put the city on a new angle. There is a moment when sleep has not begun and the day refuses to admit it is dead where everything important slips because nobody is holding the top of the box. The dampening liked that moment. It likes unowned time. It slid along the roof gutters and into the sleeping apartments and found lungs practicing trust. At the Clockhouse, the bell flicked the handkerchief and the handkerchief told the wind, and the wind\u2019s laugh was enough to disturb the tidy layer the Concord wished to lay. In the tunnels, Pax snuck a second loop of sand where nobody had asked and then declared himself innocent to the air, which is not a court with jurisdiction but does approve of audacity. In the Pylon, the Shepherd\u2019s Choir-bone remembered for an instant the sound of a thousand throats refusing to agree about anything except beauty, and in that instant it forgot what floor it had been told to enforce.\n\nThey made the city go wrong together in small, disciplined ways. They walked off-beat on sidewalks, two steps and a stumble, two steps and a hitch, and the wave attempting to ride their cadence like a horse discovered it had bought a goat. They put little bells where nobody could scold them for a noise complaint because the bells were sewn inside jackets and tied under tables, and whenever the grid tried to take the breath out of a room, the metal answered with a civility that sounded like a threat. They miscounted to children and let the children correct them, which embedded in those small faces the intoxication of catching adults out and therefore made future obedience less certain. They refused, when they could, to do anything on the beat.\n\nWhen dawn arrived indecently early as a favor to no one, the city had not won and had not lost. It had reached the end of a day that wanted to count toward something and been counted by the right hands. Ilyria slept between insistences with her face turned toward a window that had learned to be a stage, and when the hook in her mind came to sit on the sill, she told it to wait until breakfast and it did, which only confirms that we misunderstand our enemies when we deny them grace. Leta stitched the bell into a new piece of cloth and wrote under it in pencil, for future thieves, don\u2019t steal this, borrow it loudly. Orrin put his head against a wall so the wall could learn his pulse and the wall, which had learned to be insulted by fewer things, decided not to take advantage.\n\nThey could not be everywhere. In a hallway in a clinic with tiles that remembered every footstep, a nurse with two pins in her hair and a secret romance with a tram inspector stood still and felt the floor wanting to introduce her to a hush she had not asked for. She looked up and saw a scratch of charcoal on the lintel, a triangle made by a boy with pockets full of maps, and she breathed and counted wrong and the hush left with poor manners. In an apartment where the radio had nothing useful to say, an old man who had never sung even drunk remembered that laughter counts and coughed in time to a joke he had been told at a bar, and the wave moved around him the way rain moves around awnings in a storm not quite committed to being disaster.\n\nA letter came from someone calling herself Carrel who wrote in a hand like a bird convinced of grammar. It said, Bright, you do not know me, but once, before we were frost and perfume in the mouths of institutions, I sang three floors up from where you stood yesterday and said a line I did not understand about the ownership of breath. They have taken our ash and made it into chalk and written on machines with it. If you wish to stop them you will have to be crude in a way the Choir taught you not to be. Break a scale. It will not be the first time music has been shrapnel. I will be in the Yard when the cranes make questions of the sky. Please bring a dumb song and no doctrine. The signature was a little sarcasm in ink, and below it a postscript: tell the boy to stop eating glue.\n\nThey met Carrel in the shadow of a turbine that had gotten vain. She was older than regret and younger than bitterness and wore a coat that had been stitched by hands that liked her more than she liked herself. When she smiled, you could see the place where beauty had been taken from her for parts and how she had reclaimed what she could by being interesting instead. She kissed Ilyria on both cheeks like a relative and then on the forehead like a nun and then stepped back as if she\u2019d bitten a lemon and found it fine. \u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d she said, which was not praise. \u201cYou are also obedient in some places it will not survive. We will have to wreck a thing and pretend it was inevitable.\u201d\n\nLeta held out her hands like a surgeon and Carrel laughed, not because it was funny but because it is too easy to love competence without asking it what it loves in return. \u201cThe Concord thinks rhythm is ethics,\u201d Carrel said, walking her fingers along the length of the turbine like a pianist letting a keyboard feel wanted. \u201cWe show them rhythm is politics. We will pull the measure until it refuses to square. We will write a seven against their four and make them count to it with their teeth.\u201d She spoke the numbers in a cadence that was not beautiful and therefore better, and Pax in the dirt mimicked her with a tapping that made the air shrug.\n\nThe plan, if forced to admit itself as a plan, was to make a moment so crooked that the Shepherd could not find a floor. They would set a counter-rhythm across the triangle\u2014the Clockhouse bell, the Yard\u2019s vanities, the throat\u2019s stubborn hinge\u2014and run a pattern through it that the Concord could not compress into a graph. People would do simple silly things on a schedule too odd to feel organized: clap on seven, breathe on three, lift a bag on five, look at the sky on one. Orrin scowled at the numbers because they insulted his feet, and then he practiced them until his shoulders learned them, because that is what you do when you were raised by drill and saved by jokes.\n\nThey warned the Council and received from it a blessing dressed as plausible deniability. The ringed woman sent a note that said, in code that was not code, if anyone asks whether we authorized insurgent choreography, tell them the minutes reflect a robust discussion of maritime insurance. The chairwoman delivered six posters with the word Windows printed in a font that had no business being interesting and a list underneath of reasons to open them at odd hours. The new-book one chewed a pencil down to its stubborn stub and wrote, just for them, not for the record, if we survive this we must codify silliness as a civic right.\n\nAt sundown they took their places. The Clockhouse glared at the sea with the superiority of things that pretend to tell time. The turbines coaxed a breeze into spinning faster by flattering it into speed. The throat under the seawall accepted its job as hinge with the petulance of a door that would rather be an arch. Leta tuned the backline to spray gossip in a sequence only a grandmother would think dignified and that is why it worked. Orrin set his people not where the hitting would be but where the touching would need to be supervised, which is a more difficult map. Pax ran along edges and drew triangles where he found them absent, because absence is an invitation.\n\nThe city lifted its chin. Carrel raised her fingers and bent them not like a conductor but like a child threatening a cat with a feather and demanding play. The first beat was a mistake on purpose. The second was a refusal. The third was a held breath. The fourth was laughter because somebody had waited wrong and discovered that wrong was acceptable. On seven, windows opened and people leaned out with hands that did not know what they had agreed to. On three, bags lifted and set down and lifted again until the dampening, confused about whether to call it work or dance, went looking for simpler prey. The Shepherd reached for floor and got a rug pulled. The resonance patch tried to ride heartbeats and found heartbeats counting nonsense with a confidence that made nonsense look like the truth.\n\nIlyria did not sing in the way that spends her. She let the word consent run along the rails, not as a sermon but as a question repeated until someone answered by accident. She tucked the silly into corners where the wave had grown proud. She let Carrel\u2019s crooked count speak first and followed it with a thread of melody so plain it embarrassed itself and thereby escaped being weaponized. She thought of the Choir in its pretty rooms and she said out loud, in front of God and the Council and the gulls and the Concord, forgive me for being uglier than you taught me, and she meant it and did not regret it.\n\nThe wave broke in places it had never broken because it had not believed that consent could be arranged in irregular shapes. It recoiled from thresholds and sulked in ducts and went to ground in clocks, and the bell bullied it. People laughed in ways that made them cough and then breathe, and coughing counts when the alternative is decorous suffocation. A boy on a bicycle counted seven so hard he almost fell and did not, and the woman with the oranges tossed one to the man who had nearly punched someone and he caught it and declared the fruit an ally, which it was.\n\nAurek, in a room with glass walls, listened to numbers misbehave and discovered pleasure and fear occupy the same physical space when you have not taught them how to share. He saw the pause on a display where nothing on paper would admit to a pause, and he did not clap because men like him are not taught where to put their hands when the right thing happens. He thought of being fired and of having to explain at holidays that he had tried to count consent and the counting had counted back, and he thought that perhaps there was a room in the city where he could practice not being on the wrong side of the arithmetic.\n\nWhen it passed, it did not announce itself with sirens or policy. It simply left. The dampening took its discipline and went to sharpen its pencils. The Shepherd held its breath like a child promised a sweet and given a sermon. The turbines settled into honest work. The Clockhouse, offended by excitement, claimed not to have enjoyed itself. People closed their windows and put pots on stoves and discovered that they were able to finish small tasks without being told they were selfish for doing so.\n\nThey would not be allowed to keep this peace, not the largeness of it. But they could keep the habits. They could keep the triangle of wrongness and redraw it in chalk whenever the rain admitted to being a collaborator. They could keep bells in handkerchiefs and the practice of asking whether a floor is a suggestion rather than a rule. They could teach the children to laugh off-beat and to forgive adults for being clumsy in the right battles. They could sit down and shake and not hide it.\n\nIlyria shook. Orrin put his arm around her without claiming ownership of the arm or the person. Leta leaned her head against the panel that had dignified the day by behaving and said under her breath that she had run out of clever and would need to go to the store. Pax climbed a stair and went back down and then went up again because that is what you do when your bones have learned a new direction. Carrel stood with her hands in her pockets and looked at the sky and apologized to no one for still wanting magnificence even on days when survival was a better project.\n\nWhen the tea-grandmother arrived, she did it without hurry and brought an onion tart and explained how to make onions speak the truth about sugar by taking too long and pretending you are not impatient. She kissed Leta on the forehead because Leta deserved to be thanked for choosing the right mistakes, and she told Orrin that dignity looks better with scuffed boots, and she told Pax that glue is not for eating unless your aunt is present and says it is a holiday. To Ilyria she said nothing for a minute and then, like someone setting down a key on a table between two women who are not yet ready to admit they live in the same house, she said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the song that saves us. It\u2019s the insistence on singing while we cook.\u201d\n\nBefore sleep, which had earned its rest, a message slid in under the door of the studio in the form of a boy who did not remember having been asked to deliver it. It was a square of paper with an ugly staple, and on it someone had typed: next escalation: totalized lull, duration 72 hours, justified as civic calm during resource rotation. The device will refuse disorder as a category. Prepare chaos or law. It was unsigned and smelled faintly of lemon. Leta pinned it to the map where only the cat could read it and the cat, trained in suffering, decided it would sit on the warning for the evening and make it warmer.\n\nIlyria lay down and could not find the border between her body and the day. She counted backward from an unreasonable number and lost her place and did not mind. She thought of the hinge and the door and the hand that presses and of the quiet she would have to make into an accomplice if the Concord punished them by being nice. She told her bones to learn slowness the way they had learned speed, and they sulked and promised to consider it in the morning. The old radio, ambitious for language, said, \u201cHold consent up,\u201d and then, shy, tried the words in a different order. It did not matter which way they sat. It mattered that they had crossed a room that had once been empty and now contained chairs.",
