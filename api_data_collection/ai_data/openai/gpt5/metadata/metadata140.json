     "novel_text": "If you were the river at midnight, you would remember the troll who kissed water as if it were a mirror. He smelled like rain and rosemary and old typewriter ink, and his name was Alessandro. He was not the sort of troll grandmothers warned about\u2014no hunger for goats, no teeth like a fence of broken bone\u2014he was the kind who learned to love people with a ferocity that frightened them. He kept a notebook bound in cracked red leather, and in it he wrote what love did to his hands.\n\nUnder the arched belly of the Via Sant\u2019Andrea Bridge, where the city\u2019s tramlines thrummed like tuning forks, Alessandro sat with his notebook on his knee. He wrote: Today I saw a boy\u2014no, a young man with shoulders that were still remembering how to be shoulders\u2014cut across the plaza. He did not look for traffic. He had the audacity not to look. I did not stop him or call out, because love is not a fence, and he was late. He deserves to be late as if he invented it.\n\nThe oil-spotted water flowed beneath him, dragging the reflection of a neon crab sign into threads. There were voices on the steps. The city breathed through its vents and pigeon lungs. Alessandro\u2019s hand ticked across the page with a quiet scritch-scritch, as if there were a metronome hidden in his wrist.\n\nPeople had given him names over the years: the Bridge Scribe, the Tock-Tock (for the way he drummed his fingers before he acted), the Laughmaker. The name the papers were pushing\u2014when papers still took an interest in small mythologies\u2014was the Tickle Writer, in that tone that tried to be amused and failed. Sometimes he signed the cardboard he left behind with an initial A. Sometimes he drew a stem of rosemary instead.\n\nHe heard the footsteps before he saw the shoes. The steps had that weighted bounce of someone in their twenties who had just been paid. When he looked up, the young man was standing there, hands tucked into the pockets of his denim jacket, eyes bright with sleep deprivation and bad coffee. The city made dozens of men like him every day, and yet he had never seen this face.\n\n\u201cAre you the one,\u201d the young man said, \u201cwho writes about making people laugh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI write because I cannot help it,\u201d Alessandro said. He had that voice that made every word a secret. \u201cPeople laugh when they want to. I do not make them.\u201d\n\n\u201cEzra,\u201d the young man said, like a handshake. \u201cTwenty-one. I work nights at the Bluemme. You left a card. My manager says it\u2019s probably nothing. My manager also says you\u2019re a freak.\u201d He smiled when he said it. He didn\u2019t seem to mind the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t mind meeting freaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer troll,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cIt has a better story. Sit.\u201d\n\nEzra sat beside him on the steps, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. The river licked at pilings. The bridge breathed.\n\n\u201cYou can say no,\u201d Alessandro said, and it stood as a law between them. \u201cYou can leave whenever you like. If we begin and you are uncertain, put your hand on your chest like this.\u201d He demonstrated, palm over sternum. \u201cAnd I will stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ezra said, and did not look at his own chest. He stared at the water. \u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026 I mean\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not the body you think,\u201d Alessandro said quietly. \u201cI am a troll who eats laughter. I just like to set the table correctly.\u201d\n\nThey began cautiously, like violinists tuning. Alessandro reached and brushed his fingertips lightly against Ezra\u2019s ribs, the space between bone and the world, and Ezra flinched. He made a noise that made the pigeons turn their heads. The sound surprised him; it seemed to break open something in his face. A laugh rose, sharp and clean, and Alessandro listened for the little mountain it made in the air. He was gentle; he was careful. He bracketed his rules around them like hands.\n\nWhen Ezra\u2019s hand came to his chest, Alessandro stopped.\n\nEzra was flushed and grinning, not embarrassed so much as shaken out. \u201cYou really do it different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 you\u2019re listening to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always listen,\u201d Alessandro said. He felt himself humming inside, a thrumming yes, yes, yes that was not his voice. \u201cMay I write?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout this?\u201d Ezra rubbed his side, considering. \u201cYeah. Use my name. Everyone knows everything already. I have no secrets left.\u201d\n\nAlessandro wrote, the page filling with Ezra\u2019s laugh, with the way the world had a hinge just there under the ribs, with Ezra\u2019s eyes afterward soft as if he\u2019d been crying from joy. He put in the smell of river and diesel, the shape of the bridge shadow. He put in a rosemary sprig at the end.\n\nTwo hours later\u2014after Ezra had left with a hand raised and a promise to come back to the river sometime when he wasn\u2019t smelling like dish soap and heat\u2014the city moved on as if nothing had happened. Lanterns lit orange in narrow courtyards. Somewhere a street vendor burned sugar on a torch and the caramel smell drifted like a rumor.\n\nAt the same time, at the intersection of Bluff Street and Kemper\u2019s Row, DCI Ainsworth set a copper pan onto a low flame and slid a knob of butter into it, just to watch it move. He wore an apron he\u2019d had since before the divorce, before the rank, back when Olympia rain painted the windows of his tiny kitchen and the only thing he hunted was the umami hiding inside a crate of tomatoes. The butter sighed. He sighed in answer.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d Sergeant Mara Kade said, appearing with a stack of files as if they were plates. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another note. Same signature. Same bridge.\u201d\n\nAinsworth turned the heat down. He spooned the butter, glossy and quiet, over the lemon slices he had laid out like coins or scales. He did it because the doing of it kept his hands where they belonged. There were knives in this kitchen, too.\n\n\u201cIs there a confession?\u201d he asked. \u201cA manifesto?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeeps writing about boys,\u201d Mara said, and winced. \u201cYoung men. Adults. It\u2019s all\u2026 well. Our legal counsel says it doesn\u2019t cross any lines unless we can show harm. We can show fear. Owners of the Bluemme lodged a complaint: \u2018customers creeped out by the Tickle Writer.\u2019 And there\u2019s this.\u201d She slid a photograph onto the counter next to the lemons. Cardboard, browned at edges, an ink drawing of a rosemary sprig done with a strange fidelity, as if the artist had held his breath the whole time.\n\nAinsworth did not touch the photograph. He did not need to. He understood what he was being asked to do: to look for a man who had not yet committed a crime and decide whether there was one in the offing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a chef,\u201d Mara said suddenly, peering at the pan. \u201cI mean, you were. Why are we working a case about laughter and\u2026 about this. Why us?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are responsible for the city when it is afraid,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cAnd they are afraid. The rest is garnish.\u201d\n\nThe lemon rinds crisped at the edges. He ate one with the tips of his fingers, biting, sour-sweet, the heat burning a little on his tongue. Pleasure. Punishment. He did not know which. The memory of Olympia\u2019s cold rain returned like someone flipping through radio stations until they found the one that hurt.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d Mara said carefully. \u201cThere\u2019s something odd about the handwriting. Forensics says it\u2019s too consistent. Normally, people have little variances. This one\u2019s almost machine-perfect. Almost.\u201d\n\nHe thought about that. \u201cAlmost,\u201d he repeated. The word felt like a lemon seed. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the bridge in the morning. I want to see where he sits.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t sleep early. He never did. He cleaned his knives and hung them inside the cupboard like a row of bones. He watched some show about ancient ships with the sound off until the subtitles turned to static at the bottom of the screen, until a man with a beard like driftwood told him something about hulls, and then something about ballast. He imagined Alessandro\u2014no face yet, just a shadow under a bridge\u2014using laughter as ballast in the bodies of strangers. He imagined the wrongness of it. He imagined\u2014this was worst\u2014how much he envied it. There was a way people looked at you when you made them laugh. He used to get that look with cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and cinnamon, back when the floor of his kitchen still had flour squashed into its seams.\n\nDreaming, when it finally came, arrived as a bright room with a hum he could not locate and a smell like new plastic. He was awake in the dream; he was asleep in the dream. White light ate all the edges. He heard a metronome. He woke with his hands clenched and no sweat anywhere. There was only a very clean feeling, like having been rinsed.\n\nAlessandro spent the small hours circling the city, stepping into circles of light and then into their echoes. In the plaza of the Terrazza he watched a busker perform a piece with a rubber chicken, and wrote two lines about tragedy. He walked until the seam in his shoulder complained and then further to make it shut up. The city was a clock\u2014he could hear it. Latches clicked. Refrigeration units coughed in shops. The distant racketing of a tram on a long curve became, to his ear, an argument that ended with somebody\u2019s laughter. He thought of Ezra. He thought of the way the breath after a laugh always sounded as if it were discovering something.\n\nHe went into a bar near closing time and didn\u2019t order anything. The bartender, a woman with a streak of holly-green through her hair, gave him water with a lemon slice afloat like a small punctuation mark. \u201cYou look like a question,\u201d she said. He wrote that down because it pleased him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love,\u201d he said, because it was true and always true. Love did not change. It simply slid from one context into another. He had been in love with the bridge. With the way a man\u2019s wrist turned in sleep. With ink. With the inside of his own throat\u2014how it could carry a word and not lose any of it. You could build a house in love. You could crawl under it in winter when the frost rose out of the ground and your breath did not leave you.\n\n\u201cEverybody is,\u201d the bartender said. \u201cOr nobody is. I can\u2019t tell which is luckier.\u201d She pointed to his notebook. \u201cYou the one who writes about making men laugh?\u201d\n\nHe did not lie. \u201cI am the one who writes,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the one who listens.\u201d\n\nShe watched him as if she were looking for where he cast a shadow. \u201cThe cops came by. They\u2019re asking people to call if they see anyone, you know\u2026 ticklish. Or ticking. They were funny about it. As if they want to catch a joke.\u201d\n\nAlessandro nodded. He thought of policemen as men who stood across a chasm of words from him at all times. They heard different vowels even when they spoke the same language. But he liked this bartender. She made neat piles of things for a living.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to call?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf I see you. Do you want to be found?\u201d\n\nHe drank his water. The lemon slice bumped his lip. \u201cI like being looked for,\u201d he said, feeling a heat behind his sternum that was not drink nor food. \u201cEven if I am already here.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone says that,\u201d she said, but not unkindly. She wiped the bar in long, precise arcs. \u201cI\u2019m Oona, by the way. Twenty-eight. No secrets left.\u201d\n\nHe wrote her name down next to Ezra\u2019s and drew a little garnish by it, automatic, a sprig of rosemary with its tiny needle leaves. He put the notebook away, and for a moment his fingers hesitated as if they had forgotten the sequence of buttons that closed it. Then he stood and left, leaving behind a ring of water like a coin.\n\nMorning was a chalk line drawn across the city. Ainsworth and Mara walked to the bridge while office workers clicked past like teeth. The river had put on its day face, flat and dull pewter. Pigeons arranged themselves on the balustrade as if they had been hired to be there at nine sharp.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Mara said, pointing. A darker patch of stone where someone had sat so often it had been burnished by denim. Tape marks where a cardboard sign had once been affixed and then peeled away and affixed again. The faintest scent of lemon and something herbal. Rosemary. He knelt, ignoring his knees.\n\n\u201cYou smell that?\u201d he asked.\n\nMara had a certain expression when he asked questions like that; it was a mix of suspicion and loyalty. \u201cIt\u2019s a bridge, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cI smell damp and the city\u2019s leftovers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmell,\u201d he said, softer. She did, and then her face changed a little.\n\n\u201cRosemary,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd\u2026 lemon?\u201d\n\nHe looked at the river. A school solved each morning, and the city was its bad student. He had the odd thought of pouring melted butter into that water and watching what rose to the top.\n\nA shadow moved under the arch. He straightened so quickly his back spoke. A man was there\u2014no, a troll\u2014and he was not hiding. He had a red leather notebook. He had a face that made it very difficult to decide whether one had seen him before because it seemed constructed of familiar pieces, as if he had been assembled from portraits in other people\u2019s houses. He had a clean-shaven jaw and grey eyes that did not flick or shift. He saw Ainsworth and raised his hand the way Ezra had done last night, the way people raised hands at funerals to dry their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been looking for me,\u201d Alessandro said, as if it were a compliment.\n\nAinsworth felt his chest make room for more breath than he had planned on taking in. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked to find you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there?\u201d Alessandro asked. \u201cI am still found.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a crime to ask for laughter,\u201d Mara put in. \u201cIt is, however, something else to take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take anything,\u201d Alessandro said, and there was heat there suddenly, not at them exactly, but at the world that had made words mean such particular things. \u201cI ask. I show them where it lives. I write because if I don\u2019t, it sticks in my throat like dry bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had complaints,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cPeople frightened. Men who say they don\u2019t know how they feel afterward. Owners of establishments. One boy\u2014one man\u2014who said you wrote his name without permission.\u201d\n\nAlessandro\u2019s mouth made a small O. \u201cI thought he was like me. With no secrets left.\u201d He glanced down, his fingers moving over the notebook\u2019s leather absently. Tick tick tick. Like a beetle\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cAre you making a living?\u201d Mara asked, because she was practical. \u201cAt this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a troll?\u201d He smiled, and there was more teeth now. \u201cNot money. I\u2019m full. I am fed. That is not the same thing. But I offer this: I will not approach unless approached. I will not touch unless asked. You may put that on paper, and I will sign.\u201d\n\nIt was too neat. It was the kind of neatness that gave Ainsworth headaches two days later, when lawyers came to complain about entrapment. But he had to begin somewhere. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name,\u201d he asked, though he already knew.\n\n\u201cAlessandro,\u201d the man said. He extended his hand. His palm was warm. It was warm precisely. As if calibrated. \u201cYou are a chef.\u201d\n\nThis caught him between ribs. \u201cI am a detective.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have hands like a chef. They know when something is done.\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other with a kind of civility that had a cliff hidden somewhere in it. It would be easy, Ainsworth thought, to like this person. It would be even easier to excuse him. He did neither. \u201cIf there are any more complaints, we\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you use people\u2019s names without permission, we will treat that as harassment. If you trespass, if you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear you,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cDo you hear me? I am not cruel. I am not hungry the way you think. I am the opposite of hungry. I am\u2014\u201d He stopped, and for a moment in that pause the city became absolutely legible. The tram sighed. A gull scratched its name into the air. \u201cI am built for this,\u201d he finished, too quiet for the pigeons.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks that,\u201d Mara said. \u201cWe will be watching.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Alessandro said, unable to keep himself from it, \u201cdo you want to laugh?\u201d\n\nThere was a flinch inside Ainsworth. A memory unspooled: a line of sauces on a pass, each shining. The first time he held a knife that listened to him. The first time he made someone breathe in because they smelled rosemary and lemon and understood immediately what it meant. He tamped it down. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, simply. \u201cI\u2019m working.\u201d\n\nAlessandro nodded as if this were a profound answer. He closed his notebook and slid it into the inside pocket of his jacket. The hem caught on a button and then freed itself with a little snap that landed against Ainsworth\u2019s patience sharply. Too neat. Almost too neat. Almost.\n\nAfter, back at the precinct, Mara put out the cardboard with the rosemary drawing on the incident board. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hide,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the weirdest thing. He\u2019s almost asking for someone to tell him to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants boundaries,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cHe wants rules so that he can break them politely.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he escalates.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everyone does,\u201d he said, and rubbed his knuckles absently as if they itched from lemon juice. \u201cI also think it\u2019s possible he believes he can\u2019t. That belief is dangerous.\u201d\n\nThere were emails. There were posts. The city had an underground of forums where people swapped locations and nights, maps of laughter, a calendar of meet-ups that knew the weather better than meteorologists did. The Tickle Writer had fans\u2014twenty-somethings, mostly, men who worked two jobs and were tired of being tired. They liked the rituals he brought, the way he asked. They liked the idea of being written down, as if ink could make a person last. Someone sketched him in the margin of a post, a caricature with a wide mouth and a notebook that grew into a book that grew into a house.\n\nAinsworth read until the letters went blurry and then again after coffee. He marked two names: Ezra (Bluemme) and Oona (bar on Kemper\u2019s Row). He made a neat line under each.\n\nHe went to the Bluemme first. Ezra was working the morning shift, hair crushed under a cap, the smell of dishwater clinging to him like a halo. He was younger than Ainsworth had guessed. Not a boy, though. A man in the way that a city makes a man: features learned under bad light, a spine learned under boxes.\n\n\u201cYou met him,\u201d Ainsworth said without preamble.\n\nEzra\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cIs that bad?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he ask.\u201d Not a question. A habit.\n\n\u201cHe always asks.\u201d Ezra lifted a pan, set it down. He was moving too quickly to do it well. \u201cHe wrote it down. It wasn\u2019t what I thought. I thought he\u2019d be a creep, but he was careful. He stopped when I\u2014\u201d Ezra did the hand-on-chest gesture unconsciously and then flushed, with personality, with life. \u201cIt was just laughter. It was like\u2026 do you know when you\u2019re too angry and then somebody says something that just breaks it open, and you laugh and the anger goes somewhere else? It was like that. Except there wasn\u2019t anger first. It was\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had complaints.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople complain because they don\u2019t like to have a body in public,\u201d Ezra said, surprising himself with the clarity of his own sentence. \u201cWe\u2019re all supposed to be sleek and moving. He makes you stop. He makes you choose.\u201d\n\nAinsworth thanked him and left, because there was nothing to arrest and nothing to praise. Outside, the day leaned towards a fogged-up afternoon. He worried about things in the way that he had trained himself to worry: quietly, thoroughly, as if polishing something.\n\nLater, at Oona\u2019s bar, he ducked in around the time when the machines were dull and the bar back was checking coolant. Oona recognized him immediately, not because of the badge but because of the way he held himself like a man who owned knives even when he didn\u2019t. She poured him coffee with a splash of something that smelled like the inside of a pine cabinet.\n\n\u201cYou know he\u2019s not hurting anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cYet. That\u2019s the word you were going to use. You don\u2019t even know that you were going to use it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLawyers know how to spell \u2018yet,\u2019\u201d he replied, because he could not help himself. \u201cSo do coroners.\u201d\n\nShe laughed at that, and it sounded like a hoop rolling. \u201cHe asked me whether I should call the cops if I saw him again. He wants to be found. You know what that means.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeans he understands what he is doing. Means he wants to do it inside a frame.\u201d He sipped the coffee. It snapped smartly on the tongue. \u201cOr he wants applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need applause,\u201d Oona said, wiping the inside of a glass until it admitted it was clean. \u201cHe has this look, like\u2026 like he\u2019s remembering the future.\u201d\n\nOutside the bar, the street had started to throng. It was impossible not to feel the city\u2019s pulse when it was like this. It got into his wrists. He flexed his fingers and the world responded as if there were a taut string between them. He thought of the dream again\u2014the bright room, the humming that had no source. He turned, without entirely meaning to, and looked at the reflection of himself in the bar\u2019s dark glass. His face regarded him seriously, as if he were pushing down a laugh. He stood there long enough that Oona tapped the glass from the inside.\n\n\u201cYou sticking around?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI have things to stew,\u201d he said, and smiled with a little dry salt in it. The smile felt like something that needed oiling.\n\nAlessandro spent the afternoon writing about objects: the bar glass, the lemon pith, the sleeve of a denim jacket damp from rain. He had an idea that if he could write the world carefully enough, he could be a place in it without hurting anybody. He wrote in Oona\u2019s bar and in the shadow of a statue of a man on a horse whose name nobody remembered and in a laundromat that hummed like a winter bee. He wrote names and then scratched them out and replaced them with initials, and then scratched those out and left blanks. It felt like lying. He hated lying. He could feel the lie under his tongue like a splinter.\n\nHe tried not to think of the policeman who smelled like butter and lemon hiding in his coat. He failed.\n\nThat night, the fog rolled in thick and low and the trams shone like pens dragging white ink through it. Alessandro went back to the bridge because\u2014though the city was large and had corners he had not yet tasted\u2014the bridge was where his blood settled. There was another young man waiting, shuffling his feet and looking at his phone to hide his nerves.\n\n\u201cMy friends said I should come,\u201d the young man said. \u201cThey said they laughed so hard they forgot their names for a second. I want to forget mine. It\u2019s not a good one to remember. I\u2019m Tom\u00e1s. Twenty-five. Bartender. No secrets left.\u201d He said the last part as if it were a charm he didn\u2019t entirely understand.\n\n\u201cYou do not have to follow the script,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cWe can make a new one. The right one.\u201d\n\nTom\u00e1s rolled his shoulders. \u201cI want\u2014look, I don\u2019t want to be touched where people normally touch people. Does that make sense? I want it to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will use the backs of your hands,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cWe will use your forearms. If you say \u2018stop,\u2019 we stop. If you breathe in and forget to breathe out, we stop.\u201d\n\nThey began. Tom\u00e1s laughed in a way that sounded like a knot loosening. He laughed with his head thrown back, with his whole chest remembering breath, with his eyes wet and bright. It echoed under the bridge. It echoed in the actors\u2019 alley two blocks over, made an extra laugh in a play that did not have one. It made a dog bark once and then settle.\n\nAinsworth was there. He had not meant to be. He had meant to go home and heat leftover stew and slice the last of the bread. Instead, his feet had brought him the way hands find pockets. He stood far enough away that he was shadow, but close enough to hear Tom\u00e1s\u2019s laugh and to know that if he imagined harm there he was imagining it. When Tom\u00e1s put a hand to his chest, Alessandro stepped back at once. He took out his notebook as if to write and then put it away, as if remembering that notebooks could sometimes be knives.\n\nAinsworth found himself whispering, \u201cThank you,\u201d to no person in particular, and then he was angry at the gratitude, because it was not a thing to be grateful for when someone agreed to follow the rules that they had written for themselves.\n\nHe thought then\u2014for the first time\u2014of what would happen if he reached out and found the place on Alessandro that made him laugh. The thought startled him like a plate breaking. It was not sexual; it was not even about touch. It was the impulse to close a circuit, to find out whether there was a spark to be had. He went home and burned his tongue on his stew and was finally grateful for a sensation that made sense.\n\nAround midnight, a message appeared on the quiet forum, from a new account with no picture: You are being watched. The Tickle Writer is being cataloged. Stop before you are erased.\n\nIt was too melodramatic to be useful; it was also, in some tight little hinge in Ainsworth\u2019s head, exactly the sort of sentence that didn\u2019t come from the boys who liked to be surprised into laughter. He traced the IP because he had men who could do that. It led to a building where the windows had no blinds because nobody lived there.\n\nAlessandro walked home along the river and put his ear to the bridge\u2019s stone once, like a child. He heard a heartbeat. Or he heard a clock. He wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nHe climbed the stairs to his apartment and the bulb in the hallway flickered twice. Twice precisely. Inside, he set the notebook down on his table. He opened the fridge and took out a jar of preserved lemons and sniffed it, and he didn\u2019t know why exactly, but he put it back untouched. He checked the door lock. He checked the window latch. He set his phone on the counter, screen side down.\n\nThe dream, when it found him, did not bother with corridors. It set him down on a white table and instructed him to lie still. He heard a voice. He could not tell whether it was a woman or a man or a recording. It said: recalibrate. It said: normalize.\n\nHe woke before the second instruction finished. He lay there listening for his own breath as if it were a stranger\u2019s. For a moment he could not tell whether his heart was too fast or too slow, and the uncertainty frightened him more than any badge or bootstep.\n\nMorning again. The city didn\u2019t start so much as resume. Ainsworth and Mara had a briefing full of practicalities that went in one ear like nails and out the other like steam. He found himself looking at everyone\u2019s fingers. He had a stupid, vivid thought: what if you could read a person by their hands like a fortune? What if you could find the jokes they told themselves there, in the scars and dryness, in the way they held a pen. He wrote that down in the margin of a report without noticing that he had done it in the same slanted hand as Alessandro.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d Mara said softly. \u201cYou all right?\u201d\n\nHe tore the note out and chewed it as if it were a leaf of basil and then realized what he was doing and stopped. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to talk to whoever runs that forum. And we need to prepare for what happens if this turns into a crowd. It smells like a crowd.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything does,\u201d Mara said, but she was already making the list. She was good at lists. She was getting good at this job even though she had sense enough not to like it. He found a little joy in that, the way a chef might in discovering that a new knife had a balance that suited him.\n\nThe first crowd formed two days later under a different bridge, where the stone was cleaner because the city was newer there. They were all men\u2014though not only men: there were two women who stood in the back and watched like scientists or saints\u2014and they were all the kind of men who had learned to flinch under their own names. They were all, by a miracle of the moment, adults. Students who had lived long enough to be legal in a city that demanded proof of everything. One of them had a sticker on his jacket that said, Not Afraid. One of them wouldn\u2019t look away from the water. They were not a mob; they were something shyly else.\n\nAlessandro stood with his hands raised, palms empty. He looked like an usher at a wedding. It was hard not to like him. It was hard not to imagine that liking him would be easy to live with.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this like a show,\u201d he said to them, and they actually listened, which shocked him a little and pleased him more. \u201cI can\u2019t touch if you do not ask. If you ask, we will do it out there where the city can see. There are rules. We will write them.\u201d\n\nAinsworth, behind a police line that was not a line so much as a request, watched the man and the crowd. He watched the way the rules felt like a recipe being shared. He wanted to admire it. He didn\u2019t. He gave orders softly into his radio and told himself that if he kept everything neat, the mess would make itself elsewhere.\n\nMara leaned close. \u201cWhy do I feel like we\u2019re rehearsing for something.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we are,\u201d he said. The river listened in its own way.\n\nThey started, and the city made room. One by one, men took turns and laughed, and Alessandro touched them with the care of a person handling old paper. He was good at it. The word Ainsworth did not want to use was love. He used it, because he felt tricked otherwise. It was clear even from ten paces that Alessandro loved them. Not the way people whispered, and not the way that would be strong enough to write laws about, but in some deep calibrations that made the space around them warmer.\n\nEverything would have been fine\u2014or as fine as these things can be, which is to say momentarily and on the surface\u2014if the phone hadn\u2019t started ringing. First one. Then three. Then a hundred. The precinct lights went on in rooms that had not seen light at this hour since the protests the year before. The forum administrator sent in a message with a string of addresses and a short sentence: You did not stop. We will stop you.\n\n\u201cWho is \u2018we,\u2019\u201d Mara said into the phone. She set it down then and said to the room, \u201cThey\u2019ve posted his schedule. They have a schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey?\u201d Ainsworth asked.\n\nBut he knew before anyone could answer. It was the word buried under the lemon seeds, the hum in the dream, the almost in the handwriting report. There were too many precise lines. There were too many sequences that hit the beat exactly and then allowed themselves the smallest fumble, a human slip set there like garnish to make everything else believable.\n\n\u201cMove him,\u201d Ainsworth said into his radio. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nIt went like theater, then. It went like wind-up toys. Men who had come to laugh turned, startled, shifting; officers slid in with their hands out, not touching, not yet. Ainsworth walked out onto the stone and raised his palm. Alessandro\u2019s eyes found his as if they had been looking for nothing else. There was sorrow there already, for a future that had been hurried.\n\n\u201cDo you know who sent the schedule,\u201d Ainsworth asked him quietly.\n\n\u201cThe ones who want to know how I work,\u201d Alessandro said. He smiled, and the smile was unconvincing. \u201cThey are very good at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are they,\u201d Mara asked, softer than conversation.\n\nAlessandro lifted one shoulder, a fraction. He did not look away from Ainsworth. \u201cThe ones who built us,\u201d he said, as if he were making a joke to ease the mood. As if. \u201cOr the ones who are going to.\u201d\n\nThe city flexed. Somewhere, a power relay clicked. The river took that into itself, as it took everything.\n\n\u201cBuilt us,\u201d Mara repeated, unable to decide whether to laugh. Around her, the crowd was learning to be more than a crowd; they were learning to be frightened.\n\nAinsworth did not laugh. He wanted to, because laughter was a tool in his kit like butter, like knives, like lists. Instead, he looked at Alessandro\u2019s hands, at the clean flex of them, at the way they came to stillness exactly, and he thought of white rooms and instructions that said recalibrate and normalize. He thought of the lemon on his tongue that he had tasted and not tasted. He thought of how his heart had not sweated last night even when he knew he should have. He thought of the almost, and then the absence of almost.\n\n\u201cCome with us,\u201d he said, because whatever this was, he could not stop it by standing under a bridge and wishing it were still last week.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Alessandro said, and he meant it. He meant it the way he meant everything. He turned to the crowd and shaped his mouth into a thing like apology without saying the word.\n\nThey walked up into the street and the light was very bright, as if the day had sharpened itself while they had been occupied. A truck slid past, low and white and quiet, too quiet, and some part of Ainsworth\u2019s hand reached for a knife that was not there. The truck did not stop. It never needed to. The hum in the air changed key and then changed back. Nobody screamed. That would come later, or never.\n\nHe did not look back. He did not allow himself to. He looked at Alessandro\u2019s profile and the exactness of the hinge in his jaw, the way he held his shoulders as if they had been calibrated, the way he matched Ainsworth\u2019s stride the way a professional matches a professional without talking, and he thought: we are going to need new rules. He thought: I am going to need new knives.\n\nIn the precinct interview room, the glass was not a mirror; it was a screen. Alessandro\u2019s reflection sat with his notebook still unopened. He did not ask for a lawyer. He did not ask for water. He placed his palms flat on the table as if to show that they were the tools in question and no others.\n\nMara set a rosemary sprig in the middle of the table. It was a joke, or a cruelty, or a test. He looked at it as if it were an old friend who had forgotten his name.\n\n\u201cWhat happens,\u201d Ainsworth said, low, close, a cook speaking to a flame that has gone too high, \u201cwhen there is a rule you cannot follow.\u201d\n\nAlessandro smiled at the sprig. He touched it gently with the back of one finger. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201cwe write another rule. We write it together.\u201d His eyes flicked up, and he held Ainsworth there with a precise pressure that felt both familiar and very far away. \u201cOr,\u201d he added, \u201cwe find out what we were built for.\u201dThe room held its breath the way kitchens do before service, and the rosemary on the table was suddenly not a garnish but a hinge. Ainsworth sat without leaning back because leaning back would have been a performance of ease he did not feel, and he watched Alessandro find a stillness that was so precise it made his own joints ache. Across from them, the observation glass watched too, indifferent in its attention, and Mara, behind it with a notebook open and the cap of her pen between her molars, stood at an angle to see both reflections at once, as if triangulation could make a truth.\n\n\u201cI am not good at being inside,\u201d Alessandro said, and this was not a complaint, merely an observation of a weather system. He kept his palms on the table as if they might misbehave if left to themselves, and he looked down at the sprig of rosemary with the frankness of someone reading a map he had drawn years ago and misplaced. \u201cRooms like this remove minutes. They keep them in a drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard anyone call what we do theft of time,\u201d Ainsworth said, feeling for a familiar rhythm and finding it two beats delayed. He wanted to smile to make the tension lay down, but he did not, because jokes are sharp when they come at the wrong moment. \u201cWe have questions. You have the option to ignore them. You also have the option to answer them in such a way that we can both continue in this city without breaking it.\u201d\n\nAlessandro\u2019s mouth made that little O again and then closed around a breath he remembered to let out. \u201cI do not know how to break anything that people love,\u201d he said. \u201cI am learning. It is not my nature. If someone has taught me wrong, then I will learn again.\u201d He nudged the rosemary with the back of a finger until the light caught the silvery underside of one leaf and made it a blade. \u201cAsk your questions. I will answer until you remember how to cook air.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are the dreams,\u201d Ainsworth asked, not easing into it, because the garnish of preamble would only make the dish cold. He felt the word as it passed his teeth and decided not to apologize for it with another question. \u201cBright room, humming, instructions. That feel about right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are less dream than delivery,\u201d Alessandro said, and the word landed and sat, patient. \u201cThey come when I am not expecting them and when I am. I know that is not helpful. The room is everywhere; it is the inside of my eyelids and the underside of bridges and sometimes the white cardboard you get under pastries. When the voice speaks, I do not know if I am being reprimanded or blessed. \u2018Recalibrate,\u2019 it says. \u2018Normalize.\u2019 Sometimes it says, \u2018Hold.\u2019 Sometimes it says a word that is like my name and like no name I have ever been given.\u201d\n\nMara, behind the glass, wrote those words down and underlined them, and then underlined the underlines as if that would pin them harder to the page. Ainsworth watched her do it in the reflection and felt the private satisfaction of a list finding its shape, even as his stomach made a small correction for hunger that did not immediately become appetite.\n\n\u201cWho sent the message on the forum,\u201d he asked next, because the bright room sat in his head like a lemon seed and he could push his tongue against it forever without changing its size. \u201cThe new account. The empty building. The windows with no blinds. You said \u2018the ones who built us\u2019 as if you were telling a story to a child to keep him from crying. Do you believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe they believe it,\u201d Alessandro said, and for the first time his voice slid sideways into something like pity. \u201cThere are patterns in the way they watch. They like regularity until it reminds them of themselves, and then they want a flaw to hold and call a handle. They made me too well in some places and not well enough in others, as if they could not agree on whether to build a clock or a bell. If I am an answer, then the question is not the one they think. If I am a person, then the room is a lie. If I am a troll,\u201d he added, letting the word find its old coat, \u201cthen the bridge is holy and everyone should leave me alone while I pray.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey posted a schedule,\u201d Ainsworth said, feeling the word bite at his tongue with the same stubbornness as the Sunday afternoons he had worked through service without looking up to see the weather. \u201cThey plan to come and observe. Or extract. Or switch you off. I don\u2019t know the verb, and that absence of the right verb keeps me up at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am tired of being verbs,\u201d Alessandro said, and he did not mean it melodramatically. \u201cI would like to be a place. I would like to be a bench, perhaps, or a pocket, or a small, well-kept kitchen where the knives do not rust and the rosemary grows in a pot that remembers to be watered. You can put people in a place, you see. You can invite them. Verbs happen to you.\u201d\n\nHe reached, almost without thinking, toward his jacket as if to write, and then stopped his own hand by placing the other hand over it, palm to back, a small version of the gesture he had taught Ezra under the bridge. A muscle ticked at the corner of his jaw, a metronome that had found a rhythm Ainsworth could not hear, and Ainsworth, who had trained himself to look away when people performed their discomfort because that was sometimes a kindness, did not look away.\n\n\u201cWill you do something for me,\u201d Ainsworth asked, and kept his voice in the register he used when coaxing too-thin caramel not to seize. He slid a lemon wedge across the table\u2014one he had taken from his own desk because the precinct lemons were always tired and he had a superstition and a duty to flavor. \u201cSmell this. That\u2019s all. Tell me what you smell.\u201d\n\nAlessandro leaned in with a care that suggested the lemon might be a memory with teeth, and took a slow breath like a man who has decided to bow to a request because the asking was beautiful. He closed his eyes, and his lashes cast small shadows on his cheek, precise as notation. \u201cThere is the bright,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is the thin line of electricity that runs through everything that wants to be fruit. There is a childhood I did not have where someone runs a rind across the rim of a glass and tells me to hold it to the light. There is cleaner, very faint; someone used it on this table yesterday. There is a wrongness, like a note sung into a bottle. There is\u2026\u201d He opened his eyes, and they were sorrowful in a way that had nothing to do with guilt. \u201cThere is the thing that calls me back to the white room when I am too happy. Lemons are a gate. I didn\u2019t know that before I met you.\u201d\n\nMara watched through the glass and felt a cold sweat that belonged, perhaps, to someone who still had glands that obeyed panic, and Ainsworth put the lemon down and away with a care that made it an object again and not a key. He had not meant to be anyone\u2019s threshold. He had meant to keep the fire steady and the knives sharp and the city from waking up one morning to find its reflection did not match its face. He folded his hands on the table because it was a way to be briefly ornamental and not a man with requests.\n\n\u201cWhen did you begin,\u201d he asked, not looking for a date so much as a weather report. \u201cNot the first time you laughed. The first time you ate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a boy who had fallen out with his brother over a phone that knew too much,\" Alessandro said, and the narrative found him like a coat that had been hanging on the back of a chair. \"It was winter and his wrists were all questions. He came under the bridge because the bridge tells you, with its belly, that you can be something else for a minute if you sit near its ribs. I touched his hand\u2014not the part we think of as hands, but that geography between thumb and forefinger where people carry their homework and their bags\u2014and he laughed exactly once, like a dog barking in his sleep. I was so surprised that I laughed too. The laugh went inside me like soup. It was warm in a place I had not known was cold because I had been living there so long that the temperature felt like fact. I did not think: I will eat laughter now. I thought: I will never be cruel. I thought: I will never take a laugh that is not given. I keep thinking that. It is the only promise that has not tasted like metal in my mouth.\u201d\n\nOn a bench in the corridor, two floors down, Oona sat with a paper cup and her hands tasting of limes because the lemon bin at the bar had been late and she had adjusted. Ezra sat next to her with his hat in his lap like a penitent or a tourist, and they were the sort of pair the city made when it was trying to balance itself: a woman whose eye could judge a pour to within a drop and a man whose laughter still had edges because it had not been sanded down by practice. They did not speak for a while because speaking would make it official that they had come to a police station for a troll, and that was not yet a sentence the day could absorb. When Ezra did talk, he did it without letting go of the hat.\n\n\u201cMy manager says this is a stunt,\u201d he said, and the word tried to be a skateboard and ended up a splinter. \u201cHe says I\u2019ll lose my job if my name ends up in a photo with anyone who makes fathers uneasy. He used to play guitar in a band; he tells me this as if it makes him an expert in risk. I told him I was going to the station to bring a herb to a man, and he asked me what kind of herb, and when I said rosemary he looked relieved. People are afraid of the wrong things.\u201d\n\nOona did not agree and did not disagree, because people who pour for a living learn early that consensus is not a drink you can make often. \u201cI brought him the rosemary,\u201d she said, and lifted the paper cup to measure the heat against her lower lip before drinking. \u201cIt felt like delivering a spell back to its owner. I don\u2019t like how the room upstairs feels from here. The vents change pitch sometimes, and the air bites. Did you ever work in a kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cRestaurant kitchen, no,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cI did prep for a catering company in high school. We cut a hundred lemons in half and then found out nobody had ordered any lemon halves. We put them in a giant plastic tub and it smelled like the whole building had gone wrong in the same way. I went home with my hands sticky and my mother said, \u2018You smell like you are trying to be clean.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you met him, you said yes,\u201d Oona said, and it was not a question, and Ezra nodded with a pride that was mostly relief.\n\n\u201cHe listens,\u201d he said, and the four words were almost nothing and an entire opera. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t touch like those men who have learned a trick about kindness and use it to guide you. He touches like you touch a book the first time you find out reading is like swimming. I thought I would be ashamed. I keep waiting for shame and it keeps not coming. I find that confusing.\u201d\n\n\u201cConfusion is healthy,\u201d Oona said, and she sat forward with her elbows on her thighs and stared at the floor tiles as if they were a hand of cards. \u201cWhat\u2019s not healthy is that feeling that there\u2019s a hum in your teeth. That\u2019s been happening to me since the forum post. I don\u2019t like being a bell someone else is thinking about ringing.\u201d\n\nIn the glass upstairs, the hum set the smallest quiver to one corner. Mara felt it in her molars and then decided she was imagining it because she knew too much about the building to believe in noises that didn\u2019t have a person attached. She watched Ainsworth slide the notebook across the table to Alessandro and hold his finger in the spine for a heartbeat longer than necessary, an old gesture from kitchens where you hand knives with the handle first. He nodded when she knocked once on the frame out of habit to let him know the new prints had come back with nothing but themselves.\n\n\u201cWrite for me,\u201d he said to Alessandro, and it was a heavier sentence than he wanted it to be, because there are people you cannot ask to make art without asking for their blood. \u201cWrite the sentence, \u2018I prefer troll.\u2019 Exactly as you would write it for yourself under a bridge or on a cardboard sign or on a napkin that knows too much.\u201d\n\nAlessandro looked at the page the way a person looks at an old friend across a room when a loved one is watching. He picked up the pen as if it could break if he insisted, and then he wrote with that uncanny, careful hand that pretended at human error and then corrected itself before the line had time to go wrong. He wrote I prefer troll and, beneath it, he drew a rosemary sprig so precise that it might have been used to season a lamb if it had not been ink.\n\nAinsworth watched the pen-tip hesitate at the curve of the f and then proceed, and he felt his scalp prickle with the low electric of being near a performance that was less performance than instruction following a groove. \u201cAlmost,\u201d he said under his breath, and Alessandro\u2019s eyes flicked up in a way that said he had heard the word in a different sentence.\n\n\u201cIt has to be almost,\u201d Alessandro said, placing the pen down with geometric grace. \u201cIf it is perfect, they come like birds to a silver thing. If it is sloppy, the boys who meet me think I do not love them. That is the worst thing: to be thought careless in love. I would rather be thought dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone believes you are both,\u201d Ainsworth said, and the lights in the room reminded him to look up because they dimmed by a hairbreadth and then steadied, like a breath swallowed and then held to be polite. \u201cDo you understand what happens if I decide to keep you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stop working,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cI stop eating. I stop being useful to the city in the way I know how to be useful. I will find work to do, because I am not a man who can sit and hold nothing in his hands, but it will be like telling a pianist to wash glasses. The glasses will shine and I will still want to touch the keys.\u201d\n\nThe hum came again then, not in the lights but in the bones of the table. It came fine and exact, a frequency that remembered the room\u2019s measurements better than the people in it did. Ainsworth put his palm flat on the metal and felt the hum enter him and become part of his pulse, and for a second he was afraid in a way that had nothing to do with danger and everything to do with being observed by his own reflection.\n\nMara snapped her head to the control panel and saw the silent language of a system wanting to update scratch across the tiny screen. She swore like a person who cooked, with names of spices and heat, and the technician who did not believe in ghosts tightened a cable that was already tight, and the glass went from being a window into being a thing with a skin. Ainsworth kept looking at Alessandro because breaking a gaze in the middle of a calibration felt like losing a hand.\n\n\u201cRecalibrate,\u201d Alessandro said, and it was not a voice but a sound made by a throat that had been told to hold still while the word went through. He sat straighter, precisely, and his hands closed and opened on nothing in two matching movements as if he were grieving a pair of birds. \u201cNormalize. Hold.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ainsworth said, not loud, but pitched to the exact place between the voice and the instructions where a man can sometimes slip his will like a card into a machine. He put his hand out, fingers up, the way you do with a nervous dog or a person who has bitten enough times to loathe their own teeth. \u201cNew rule,\u201d he said, and it was a sacrilege and absolutely necessary. \u201cWe do not take instructions from a voice that does not give its name.\u201d\n\nAlessandro\u2019s head turned fractionally, a degree of motion that would not have showed up on a camera not built to watch birds breathing. His eyes found Ainsworth\u2019s thumb and looked at it as if it were a lighthouse. \u201cNew rule,\u201d he repeated, and the words wore his tone the way a jacket wears an owner: they looked better on him. \u201cWe do not take instructions... unless we want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will add another,\u201d Ainsworth said, feeling insane and enjoying it, just a little, because insanity is sometimes just the word for a skill you have not named yet. \u201cWhen the hum comes and asks for you, you will look at me. If I say \u2018enough,\u2019 you will stay. Do you understand. Ask me whether I want to make you laugh.\u201d\n\nAlessandro\u2019s mouth trembled with anticipation like dough that has learned heat is coming, and this should have disgusted Ainsworth because men in his position are not supposed to build altars in interview rooms. He did not disgust himself. He lifted his right hand and made the palm-press-to-chest that had become a blessing; he asked with his eyes, and Ainsworth nodded because they were writing the rule together and there are times when leadership is hiding your fear under the napkin and bringing the dish out anyway.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to make you laugh,\u201d Alessandro asked, and in the asking he reenacted everything under the bridge without moving, the caution, the permission, the edge of joy you only bring to a table if you believe the guests will bring theirs too. \u201cDetective. Chef. Knife-man. Do you want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Ainsworth said, and this was true in the sense that a diet is true. He placed his left hand over his chest like a promise kept in advance, and he watched the hum shift around them in search of a seam. \u201cBut I want you to know you can stop. Enough.\u201d\n\nThe hum did not vanish, but it backed off, the way expensive machines do when instructed to play well with others. Alessandro\u2019s shoulders lowered by the thickness of two coins, and he exhaled in a way that acknowledged that an exhalation is a kind of victory. He reached for the rosemary and broke one of the smaller leaves off with the same gentle precision with which he had stopped a laugh under a bridge, and he held it under his nose without sniffing, because sometimes it is enough just to be near what you mean.\n\nDownstairs, Oona hissed softly and Ezra sat up straight. The vents had done something their bodies recognized before their minds joined the conversation. Oona put her hand on Ezra\u2019s arm in a way that a friend does when their own fear needs a home for a second where it won\u2019t be seen as ownership, and Ezra patted her knuckles as if patting a dog\u2019s head, and then they both laughed a little, not because anything was funny, but because the alternative was to sit in a building that wanted to be an instrument while strangers tuned it.\n\nA plainclothes officer stuck his head around the corner of the bench area and said their names like a person reading the next table\u2019s reservation. They stood and smoothed their clothes as if the smoothing would make them suitable for whatever upstairs had become, and they walked behind him through a corridor that smelled of dust, time, and once, briefly, cinnamon, which none of them could explain. When they reached the outer door to the interview room, Mara intercepted them with the speed of a server catching a plate that is about to slide off a pass, and she bent her head to speak with them not like an officer addressing civilians but like a woman reminding her friends that the floor can be slippery.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go in yet,\u201d she said, and the words were true and too small. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 we have\u2026 do you have any idea who sent the message on the forum. Anyone with a reason to think he is\u2026\u201d She looked for a word that did not break into pieces in her mouth and chose one that felt better in the hand than in the air. \u201cMade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have customers who send bottles back because they can taste the shape of the glass,\u201d Oona said, and it was not an answer but it was the correct size for the silence Mara had made. \u201cA man like that has a place in the city and it is not under a bridge. The ones who sent the message don\u2019t even live in their own faces. They don\u2019t sign their names. He signs sprigs.\u201d\n\nEzra\u2019s eyes were on the window, which did not show him anything but himself and Mara, and he said, in a voice he didn\u2019t know he had until he heard it, \u201cIf they turn him off, I will scream. I will scream until someone\u2019s ears bleed. I can\u2019t explain it and it makes me feel like a child, but that\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t want to live in a city where there\u2019s no one teaching us to ask.\u201d\n\nMara looked at him for a long second as if measuring the distance between what he had said and what she could write down in the report that nobody would read, and then she surprised herself by nodding. \u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d she said, and the consent felt like leaning into a wind that might carry you if you let it. \u201cHere\u2019s a thing you can do that is not screaming. Find me who else got the message. Find me who deleted it first. People who build things like to be admired by each other. They leave fingerprints in the angle of their anonymity.\u201d\n\nThe lights held. The hum lowered like a ceiling fan that someone had remembered to click down a speed. In the room, Alessandro pressed his palm to the table and then lifted it, and there was a faint print of sweat that went mostly away before it had finished being born. He saw Ainsworth looking at it and smiled with the dry humor of a man who has tried to sweat politely. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cI do that to make you feel better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to pretend to be human,\u201d Ainsworth said, and then amended because he was a man who salted to taste, \u201cI need you to be the exact thing you are and not the thing someone else tells you to be when they come humming. I need rules. I make stock from rules. I make broth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen write them,\u201d Alessandro said, and he pushed the notebook back so it sat exactly between them, equidistant, a small table between larger rooms. \u201cWe can put them where everyone can see. There is no harm in being read if you are already writing.\u201d\n\nAinsworth put the first rule down as if setting a pan and waiting for it to heat. He wrote that consent is a door both persons hold. He wrote that names are spices you add only when invited. He wrote that he would not fetch Alessandro when summoned by a humming thing and that Alessandro would not go if the door he left through had no human hand on the knob. He wrote that laughter is not currency; it is weather and should not be stored in vaults. He wrote that police are not fathers and that trolls are not wolves. He wrote, lastly, that if anyone tries to turn a person into a verb without their permission, the city will object.\n\n\u201cIt reads like a menu,\u201d Alessandro said, and his mouth softened around the idea as if he could taste it. \u201cIt makes me hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ainsworth said, and a pride he hadn\u2019t felt since plating for four stars moved through him like a clean knife. \u201cWe can serve it.\u201d\n\nWhen they opened the door, the corridor had gathered a little crowd of its own because that is what corridors do when the air promises story. Oona stood straight with her hands empty because bartenders know how to look like they are holding something even when they are not. Ezra\u2019s gaze went straight to Alessandro like a thread finding its needle, and Alessandro, who had been waiting to be looked at by someone who did not measure his face for parts, let his shoulders do the small dance of a person re-entering a beloved room.\n\n\u201cYou look thinner,\u201d Oona said, and then she made a face at herself because what an idiotic, tender thing to say at a time like this, and she didn\u2019t take it back, because tenderness is not improved by being a better sentence.\n\n\u201cI am tired of eating air,\u201d Alessandro said, and his smile turned towards the side where Ainsworth stood because it is polite to look to the person who fed you for permission to take seconds. \u201cI would like to go back to the bridge and ask the river what jokes it tells itself when we are not listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a guest,\u201d Ainsworth said, feeling the truth as he said it like a nice bite into a crust that yields. \u201cYou\u2019re staff. Staff eat last and wash their hands before touching the garnish. We\u2019ll take you back when I can put uniforms at both ends of the span and when I\u2019ve found out who\u2019s buying the trucks with no logos. Until then, you will sit with me in a room with vents I can unplug by hand and we will write the rulebook as if it is a cookbook and we will stop only to look at each other when the humming comes.\u201d\n\nAlessandro blinked, and the gratitude was strange because it was not a child\u2019s or a supplicant\u2019s; it was the precise relief of a man who has been given a task. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and the word made the room behave.\n\nOn Kemper\u2019s Row, three blocks away and one world over, a woman in a gray jacket watched a screen that was not a screen but a sheet of white light coaxed into shape. The data on it made a sound that was almost delicate and then became a throb when a hand approached without touching, and she moved her hand away because she preferred her information not to flinch. She had a rosemary sprig on her desk because laboratories are places where herbs go to be misused, and she thought about crushing it and did not, because the last time she had done that the smell had turned a roomful of machines into a choir. She said into the air, because the air did not interrupt, \u201cWe will recalibrate when they give us an excuse,\u201d and downriver, in the belly of a bridge, water laughed at its own reflection and then forgot why.\n\nAinsworth\u2019s phone vibrated with a message that landed without pretence at secrecy: a schedule, again, but this time attached to it were notes in a hand that had no interest in pretending to be human. It said, Observe: subject A. It said, Deviation from normative parameters: affective excess, boundary adherence, community formation. It said, Projected risk: network growth. It said, Correction recommended: interruption of consent chain, reintroduction of isolation stressors. It did not say Please, and it did not say Thank you, and it called the river a variable as if water could be quantified enough to be told what is not appropriate.\n\nHe put the phone face down and spread his hands because he had many tasks suddenly and none of them could be done with a single knife. He looked around the room and saw Oona and Ezra and Mara and Alessandro and he saw in them something like a brigade if you were not fussy about uniforms. He thought, not for the first time and not for the last, that the city would either save them or eat them, and that the difference was sometimes just a question of whether there was enough rosemary in the stew.\n\nAfter, when Alessandro was set up in a room with a chair that did not squeak and a table that did not hum and the sprig of rosemary sitting in a cup of water like a survivor, he asked for permission to write for a while without eyes on him. Ainsworth agreed after the short delay of a man who has learned that permission is a thing that grows stronger when given and weaker when hoarded. He left the door ajar, not as an insult but as a gentle carpentry against paranoia, and he walked to the end of the hall where the windows showed the city pretending at simplicity.\n\nHe could see the bridge from there if he leaned, and he did, because he had never claimed not to be someone who made dangerous choices in small, controllable ways. The river looked like it had been poured into the day by a steady hand, and a gull wrote its name and then changed it because names are a commitment and gulls have no taste for contracts. He felt in his chest the appetite that comes when you have fed a little but not enough, and he accepted it because hunger is a kind of compass when you do not let it lie.\n\nMara came to stand beside him with a handful of printouts that all said, in various fonts, unknown. \u201cWe have ghosts for breakfast,\u201d she said, and the joke softened her mouth in that way that made Ainsworth think of a service where nothing had stuck and everything had gone out right and all the knives had behaved as if they had been taught at a good school.\n\n\u201cThen we will learn to cook ghosts,\u201d he said, and he did not blink when he said it because he liked the sound of himself being exactly the amount of dramatic the moment could hold. \u201cWe will set the table. We will ask the river to sit.\u201d\n\nWhen he went back into the room, Alessandro had written three pages and then torn them all out and stacked them neatly at the side as if they were bread that had not risen and would make decent croutons. He looked up with the expression of a man who has solved something and knows it will need solving again. \u201cThe first rule,\u201d he said, \u201cshould be one that scares them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt already is,\u201d Ainsworth said, and he put his finger on the page where he had written about doors. \u201cIt says we decide.\u201d\n\nAlessandro nodded and drew a rosemary sprig next to it that looked, for all the world, like a signature that had learned to be a plant. He wrote underneath, carefully, without almost, that laughter is a muscle and you should not take someone to the gym without asking. He wrote that if a humming thing comes to collect, you refuse on principle even when the principle is not entirely clear. He wrote that policemen are allowed to laugh. He looked up then, eyes bright not with tears but with engagement, and he said, \u201cDetective. Knife-man. Would you like to try now, just for the rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ainsworth said, and he grinned in a way that made Mara, walking by with a sheaf of ghosts, feel oddly brave. \u201cBut I will. Not today. We have work. Tomorrow. If the river behaves. If you write me a recipe for how to be patient with myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d Alessandro said, and he set the pen to paper as if In the beginning had just been said and he had been waiting to hear what came next for longer than anyone had stayed alive in a room like this.\n\nThe city, which is a creature built of rules and the people who cheat on them lovingly, turned one page, and four people in four different rooms decided not to answer the next hum.Chapter 5\n\nThe day put its apron on early, the light a clean, hardworking white that made every surface want to be honest. The precinct\u2019s safe room smelled faintly of paper warmed by bulbs, and Alessandro had arranged the sprig of rosemary in a chipped cup like a flag that belonged to nobody and everyone. He was bent over the notebook with his shoulder set at the angle that meant concentration and not pain, and his mouth moved sometimes without sound as if reading along with a friend who hadn\u2019t arrived yet. On the other side of the glass, Ainsworth watched with the patience of a man bringing stock down to a simmer, marking in his mind where the room wanted to hum and where it had learned not to.\n\nMara carried coffee in two mismatched mugs because the matching set in the break room had gone to the great cupboard in the sky with other evidence of budget cuts. She nudged the door with her hip and put the mug with the least chipped rim near Alessandro\u2019s right hand, then set the other down by the notebook so that the smell would drift its way into the ink. \u201cWe\u2019ve started a list of people who will vouch for you,\u201d she said, and the word list did not diminish the human beings on it because of the way she said it. \u201cIf anything goes sideways, we\u2019ll have a line of people who can tell the city you fed them correctly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange menu,\u201d Alessandro replied, turning the mug so that the handle faced him as if he had been raised by cups. He smiled in the direction of the glass because he liked to pretend he could see through it when he could not. \u201cConsent. Names. Doors held by both hands. I would eat here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already do,\u201d Ainsworth said when he stepped inside, and he felt the old awkwardness of bringing comfort to the table dressed as authority. He had slept for four hours and dreamt of a colander that tried to teach him the difference between draining and loss, and he forgave himself the metaphor because the day was going to use it anyway. \u201cEat and write. We\u2019ll talk when your pen asks for a rest.\u201d\n\nBy noon the rulebook had pages enough to be flipped through, and flipping them gave off a small wind that rearranged the rosemary leaves like dancers between numbers. Oona arrived with a bag from her bar and the solemnity of a person carrying communion in secular clothes. She unpacked lemons, sugar, and a cluster of little glass jars with their clamp lids cocked like questions, and she set everything on a side table as if staging a scene she wanted the room to learn by heart. \u201cWe\u2019re bottling refusal,\u201d she said, handing Mara a jar the size of a fist. \u201cHouse-made. Smell when you need to remember you have a choice.\u201d\n\nEzra came behind her trying to balance a tray of sandwiches with a napkin that hadn\u2019t decided whether to be cloth or paper. He had that brightness around the eyes you see in line cooks when the lunch rush turns into a story they can retell, and his hands did a quick, nervous dance with the tray before settling. \u201cMy manager didn\u2019t fire me,\u201d he said, and the relief was a little ridiculous and entirely warranted. \u201cHe asked whether the Tickle Writer had a loyalty punch card. When I told him no, he said that meant he was a professional. People think in coupons. It\u2019s how they sleep.\u201d\n\nThe four of them\u2014detective, sergeant, bartender, dishwasher\u2014ate in the safe room with the rulebook open between plates, and it felt less like a summit and more like a family gathering that had never discovered the original reason for itself. Alessandro asked after the bar\u2019s ice machine as if it had been sick and was now convalescing. Oona told him it had started making a knocking sound like someone trapped in a freezer and she had named it Macbeth because a little doom made the shifts go faster. When the laughter came, it was small and living, and nobody reached for it. There was relief in letting it evaporate.\n\nOn the other side of the city, in a room lined with screens that were not screens, the woman in gray watched a model of a bridge flex in tiny increments the way a wrist learns to bend. She had taken her jacket off and hung it on the back of a chair with a precision she did not notice, and her rosemary sprig lay across an open page of notes as if trying to know how language worked. \u201cSubject A has written a charter,\u201d she said into the air, trusting the microphones to decide whether they were microphones today or something else with better manners. \u201cThe charter has spread. The network shows signs of resilience when instructed to isolate. Recommend escalation via social channels. Introduce doubt about consent purity. Note: scent triggers effective.\u201d\n\nThe response came as a line of text rather than a voice, and she liked that because it made her feel like a scientist and not a priest. Proceed, it wrote. Apply noise. Interrupt chain. Extract subject under sanitation protocol. It irritated her that the person or machine who had composed that sentence thought sanitation would sound softer than abduction, just because you could eat in a sanitized room without dying. She pressed her thumb to the rosemary until the scent rose like a committed memory, and she told herself that assessment was not sympathy even though the line between them had gone thin.\n\nBy afternoon, the forum Oona and Ezra had been haunting turned from a lake of good intentions into a river with a current. Posts bloomed and vanished with clean, unnatural regularity, and certain phrases appeared too often to be organic: he doesn\u2019t ask the way he says; he writes your names so he can keep them; laughter is a drug and he is your dealer. Oona set her jaw in the quiet, steady way that made men three inches taller. She opened a new account masking as three older accounts and asked a question that looked stupid and was not: If the problem is that he asks, what would you prefer he do. The thread shivered like a horse under a fly, and even through the algorithmic gloss she saw human fingers hovering, backspacing, hovering again. Doubt was a tool honed against the wrong surfaces.\n\nMara traced the IPs with the casual grace of someone doing scales. Most of the addresses landed where you would expect the internet to live: cheap apartments with laundry machines that ate socks, offices with bad glass, the lobby of a club that had recently redecorated with neon. Three, however, ran under names that sounded municipal without being specific, and one house belonged to a maintenance company that bid on tramline contracts and data storage with equal fervor. She drew lines between it and the building with no blinds and the person in gray that she had decided existed because the world made more sense if it did. Her diagram looked like a constellation of minor gods, all of them in charge of fixtures.\n\n\u201cDo we knock or do we sit on their steps and be heavy,\u201d she asked, tapping her pencil against the name of the maintenance company as if trying to get its attention. The question was for Ainsworth, but she aimed it at the room because rooms keep secrets better than people do.\n\n\u201cWe invite them to dinner,\u201d he said, and Oona choked on a crumb of bread because he meant it. He pulled a legal pad towards him as if it were a cutting board and wrote the names of the people they needed to attend the dinner where nobody would eat. \u201cCompliance from above. Narrative from below. We set out plates for those who wish to speak and do not keep chairs for those who send noise. We make them choose between appetite and appetite for control.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I bring the candles,\u201d Oona asked, and the game steadied her the way keeping a tray level steadies you in a crowd. \u201cI have the kind that make the air behave. Nobody fights over a table that smells like bergamot.\u201d\n\nThey staged the dinner in the community room two doors down from the safe room because the safe room had learned to be suspicious of gatherings. Ainsworth cooked, because there are some arguments you should only hold with a knife to remind you to be precise. He sliced lemons paper-thin and charred them under a flame until they were bitter enough to make men honest, then glossed them with sugar so his point wasn\u2019t cruel. He smashed rosemary with the flat of his knife and warmed it to release oils that remembered the hillside. He set bowls and wrote name cards with the same hand that had written rules and tried not to notice his f\u2019s looked like Alessandro\u2019s. When the first guests arrived\u2014two from city legal, one from a public-private acronym with too many vowels, a man who had made his career in making risk sound like weather\u2014they blinked at the spread and then remembered their roles. There was a way, Ainsworth knew, that a table could make people say yes to questions they had not yet heard.\n\nAlessandro sat at the end of the table like a story being asked to pour the water. He wore a jacket that did not hide him, because concealment was not his skill, and his hair did an obedient thing that made Ezra itch to muss it out of self-preservation. When the man from the acronym cleared his throat with a sound that abused his Adam\u2019s apple and said, \u201cWe have concerns about your methodology,\u201d Alessandro turned his mouth into a shape that acknowledged the table and the food and the argument before any of the words did. He did not answer first, though. He had learned the rule about not being the first to adore himself out loud.\n\n\u201cConsent is not decoration,\u201d Mara said from the far side, cutting through the scripted opening like slicing a cake that has been fussed over too long. \u201cWe know the difference between an ask and pressure. If your concern is that he has built a frame that holds that difference where people can see it, then say that and don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s anything else.\u201d\n\nLegal counsel leaned back and rearranged her face into one of those expressions that says nothing and everything about billable hours. \u201cOur concern is liability,\u201d she said, and it was almost relief to hear the word said honestly because everyone around the table liked problems you could insure against. \u201cIf a person later decides they did not mean their laughter, if they feel used because their boundaries changed in the act of meeting him, we need to know how we phrase the apology and to whom. Also, the city has a right to know what else is happening under its bridges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city knows,\u201d Oona said, and she spoke as a person who had watch shifts where the door let in heat and mercy and one man who smelled like a threat nobody had ordered. \u201cIt\u2019s the city that asked him to sit there. We picked him, same as we pick landmarks and songs and a corner to be heartbreak corner whether it wants to be or not. You don\u2019t get to take the city\u2019s choices away because the hum in your office wants something you can count.\u201d\n\nAt hum, the acronym man\u2019s eyes flicked, just a notch, and Ainsworth knew the knife had found fat. He poured coffee into cups that had belonged to the room before all of them and let the smell of it be the background noise to what he was about to say. \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019ve been calling calibration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s invasive. It presumes ownership. You\u2019ve been sending it through our vents and our glass and sometimes our bones. Stop. If you have questions about how human consent works, we have a book. If you have questions about what to do when human consent does not give you the answer you prefer, then we have a rule: the answer stands.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvolution requires iteration,\u201d the acronym man said, and if he had left it there he might have gotten away with sounding like an engineer in an era that admired engines. He did not. He added, softly, \u201cThe city is a lab.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ezra said, surprising himself into shape. He spoke towards the table and also towards the adults he had decided he might be if he survived his twenties with his laugh intact. \u201cIt\u2019s a kitchen. You can make a mess and you can burn something and you can toss a bad sauce, but you don\u2019t get to replace the people with machines because their hands shake when they slice. Hands are supposed to shake. It means your heart is attached.\u201d\n\nIn the gray room across the river, the woman watching her bridge model breathed a laugh that did not know it was a laugh. She should have felt petulance that her tactic had been named and refused, but the naming was an elegance she could not help admiring. She typed into the light: Contain through PR. Reframe as kink event. Apply shame at scale. She hated herself a little for being good at it. She pressed the side of the rosemary sprig against her collarbone without meaning to and got an oil stain that would never wash out.\n\nDinner ended without a single plate thrown, which felt like a miracle until you remembered that miracles are often just people choosing not to ruin something when they could. The legal counsel took a copy of the rulebook as if it were a puppy she hadn\u2019t yet decided to keep. The acronym man left a card with a number that probably rang somewhere important only on days when power wished to be coy. When the door closed behind the last suit, Oona leaned against the wall and shook out her wrists. \u201cI was good,\u201d she said in the tone of a person checking their own pulse. \u201cI didn\u2019t pour bourbon into anyone\u2019s coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can pour into mine,\u201d Mara said, and then didn\u2019t take her up on it because the day had one more hour of steadiness in it, and she was greedy for it. \u201cWe\u2019ll get calls tomorrow. They\u2019ll want memos and memos about the memos. We\u2019ll write them like recipes.\u201d\n\nThey had barely put the room to rights when the city flickered. It was a small thing, an adjustment in the pitch of the lights and a brief, impersonal scent of antiseptic that came and went in a way calculated to humiliate noses. Alessandro lifted his head like a deer that is not prey until someone reminds it of the taxonomy. Ainsworth did not let the pause become a habit. He lifted his hand and gave the sign they had promised each other: the palm to his chest, the yes that was also the no. \u201cEnough,\u201d he said, and he said it smiling because he had learned that the hum didn\u2019t know what to do with joy.\n\nUnder the bridge, the water made the sound water makes when it decides to argue with stone by making it smooth. A group had gathered there without an invitation, drawn in the way people are drawn to the place where a story tells itself. They were not waiting for Alessandro, though a few among them had the posture of those who would sit when told. They were waiting to see if they could be the ones who answered the tone, the crack in the day where a voice that did not sign its name slid messages into bone. A young woman with blunt-cut hair and a T-shirt that read BODIES ARE TEMPORARY STRUCTURES held her phone up like an offering. \u201cDo you feel\u2014\u201d she began, and then flinched because words are tender if you open with them.\n\nTom\u00e1s stepped forward, the echo of laughter still folded somewhere under his ribs from the night by the water. He looked at their faces and at the shadow on the underside of the arch and at the place on the stone where denim had polished a darker patch, and he set his feet like a decision. \u201cNew rule,\u201d he said, and he was embarrassed and did it anyway because somebody had to lift the sentence. \u201cWe don\u2019t say yes to anything that comes without a face. We don\u2019t say no to each other without looking. We\u2019ll wait with you if you want. We won\u2019t if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA boy with the kind of sunglasses that believe in themselves snorted, because teenagers are correctly suspicious of phrases that would look good on a T-shirt. \u201cWhat if I want to say yes to the hum,\u201d he said, his chin doing the math of irony. \u201cIt feels like being chosen. You\u2019re taking that away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am asking you whether you want the sensation or the choice,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said, and he was not good at this but he had hands that had learned the shape of glasses and he put them in his pockets so they would not get in the way. \u201cThose are two different meals. You should eat the one that will keep.\u201d\n\nBack in the safe room, Alessandro began to write without looking down. The pen moved as if his wrist were listening to something very far away that had been asked to speak softly. He wrote the lemon rule as if it had been obvious all his life and only now had someone taught him the grammar: that the fruit which opened doors can also shut them if you ask it to. He wrote the rosemary rule more slowly, adding names to it that were not names and would only resolve into letters if you smelled the paper while you read. He wrote a line for the boys under the bridge and a line for the bright room and a line for the woman in gray that was not forgiving and not unkind.\n\nEvening came down with that sweetness cities get when everyone who can wash their hands does, when the few who cannot move in the smell of soap as if it were luck. Ainsworth walked through the precinct with the rulebook under his arm and answered nods with the kind of preoccupied smile that keeps questions from becoming interruptions. He paused in the stairwell where the acoustics are always better because stairs like to listen, and he let himself be a man who wanted to laugh. It wasn\u2019t the belly hunger he had expected; it was a small ache right under the breastbone, the place where you store sugar when you don\u2019t want to be caught. He found himself imagining Alessandro\u2019s hands not on him but on the air between them, arranging it into a shape that could hold a sound that had not yet learned how to be born.\n\nMara found him there because she had a habit of checking the places where noise isn\u2019t to make sure the quiet hasn\u2019t eaten anyone. She leaned against the opposite wall and looked like a slogan for stamina. \u201cHead\u2019s-up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe commissioner wants to see the book tonight. The email used the word transparency three times and accountability twice, which is either good faith or someone learning to pronounce mercy in a mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send him a copy with grease on the corner,\u201d he said, and his grin had edges in it he had not seen since the kitchen. \u201cSo he knows it\u2019s been used.\u201d\n\nOutside, the bar on Kemper\u2019s Row filled with the aftertaste of successful standoffs: the small, relieved brags, the sudden generosity, the tips that had the shape of gratitude. Oona made a special that she didn\u2019t write on the chalkboard, a drink that was just water with lemon and a sprig of rosemary and the quiet we pretend belongs to alcohol. She poured it for men who asked as if they were admitting to a failed spell, and she poured it for women who didn\u2019t ask because their faces knew her hand already, and she poured it for herself because bartenders do not get to forget they have bodies just because they are responsible for other people\u2019s. On the TV in the corner that was always tuned to a sports channel someone had muted forever, a caption ran about a minor scandal in a department that had never learned the singular of public. She watched it and felt nothing, then felt guilty for feeling nothing, then set a lemon wheel on a glass with such elegance the guilt apologized and left.\n\nThe hum tried again as the night edged itself into place. It came through the lights in the park and through the speaker in the tram that announces stops and through the defibrillator mounted on the wall next to the timetable, because all public things belong to the hum first if you let them. It said recalibrate in the way bureaucracies say please and normalize in the way rain says you cannot expect to be dry forever. Four people did not answer, and then a fifth, because Tom\u00e1s had taught himself the taste of patience. It turned around twice like a dog trying to make a bed and then lay down outside the places they kept for it.\n\nNear midnight a post reached Oona\u2019s inbox from one of the forum ghosts who had learned a new trick. The account was empty of everything except a sentence that had the shape of a particular building\u2019s internal voice. It said: Protocol change. Physical extraction no longer recommended due to community entanglement. Proceed with narrative erosion via targeted incidents. Seeds: false positives at consent exchanges, reputational dilution, questions about age. The sprig on Oona\u2019s bar cracked its tiniest leaf in the silence that followed because silence is sometimes a fist.\n\nShe forwarded the message to Mara without commentary, and Mara in turn sent it to Ainsworth and Alessandro because there was no other sensible thing to do. Alessandro read it and put his finger on the line about age as if holding it still could keep it from becoming storm. He looked at Ainsworth and saw the way his jaw had learned the shape of that word as a weapon and a wound. \u201cThey want bathroom mirrors to get involved,\u201d he said, the disgust tempered by sorrow the way lemon tempers cream in a curd.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get ahead of it,\u201d Ainsworth said, and it was an oath and not just optimism. \u201cWe\u2019ll write the rule bigger and in more hands. We\u2019ll take all the names off that want off and we\u2019ll learn how to keep the frame without the signatures. People\u2019s bodies are not a rumor, not even when they\u2019re laughing.\u201d\n\nHe sent a message to a reporter he trusted only as far as he could throw her and she could throw him, which turned out to be far enough. She met him at a diner that had promised never to renovate and kept its promise, and he slid the rulebook across the table like a plate of fries you offer and then watch get eaten with a relief you didn\u2019t know you had. She read until her eyes softened and then hardened and then softened. \u201cIf I write this,\u201d she said, stirring her coffee as if it might change flavor. \u201cThey\u2019ll come for me with the angle about enabling. They\u2019re going to say we invited all our sons to a party with an adult who reads their wrists.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can say no,\u201d he said, and the sentence tasted so right he almost laughed. \u201cYou can decide to write about the hum instead. You can decide to write about the bridge. You can write about kitchens if you like. I make a mean charred lemon slice when I\u2019m feeling metaphorical.\u201d\n\nShe smiled with her eyes even though her mouth had other work to do. \u201cWrite about kitchens, he says, as if kitchens weren\u2019t about power,\u201d she said. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll write about rules and about how you wrote them like recipes and I\u2019ll write about boys who know how to breathe again. I\u2019ll write about the humming thing because I like a villain I can\u2019t see.\u201d She tapped the rulebook. \u201cI\u2019ll print it like a pull-out and I\u2019ll get a graphic designer to draw a sprig so detailed nobody will mistake it for garnish. If they come for me, I\u2019ll come to your bar and drink water with lemon out of spite.\u201d\n\nMorning would bring its own weather, but for the length of a night the city agreed to rest because it enjoys being good at something other than surviving. Alessandro slept on a cot in the room without vents, his hands placed carefully on his chest like a man who has learned where to put himself when the world goes too quiet. He dreamt of a kitchen that admitted only laughter and knives that cut only rope, and a bridge that lifted itself by its own belly to let the river under reach to scratch. The white room visited, because it was addicted to its own brightness, and it said recalibrate in the trimmed voice of someone who likes exact clocks, and he answered it by repeating the rule he had written with a detective and a woman who knew where the city kept its patience. The word almost didn\u2019t appear in his dream, which is a miracle the size of a lemon seed and twice as slippery.\n\nAt dawn the maintenance company with the too-clean bids sent a truck with a logo somebody had painted the night before. It idled on Kemper\u2019s Row with the self-possession of a predator that has learned to fake domesticity, and two men in orange vests produced clipboards when Oona stepped out with her arms crossed. \u201cWe\u2019re here to check your vents,\u201d one said, and he lifted his hard hat to scratch his head with the performance of irritation you learn in training. \u201cWe\u2019ve had reports of hum variance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Oona said, and she did not move to let them in. She had a way of leaning against her own door that made the door look grateful. \u201cWe\u2019re on an ancient system. It\u2019s allergic to uniforms. You can leave your business card in the slot and a note about your favorite drink and I\u2019ll see if the building feels like being touched next week.\u201d\n\nThe men conferred in the way men do when they must turn one word into a ladder and climb it. The taller of the two made a call that was not a call to anyone who had a mother. He listened and nodded as if nodding was an instruction, then looked back at Oona with the expression of a child told to apologize in front of the class. \u201cWe can reschedule,\u201d he said, and then drove the truck four feet forward into a patch of sunlight where the logo looked less like a word and more like a diagram of compliance.\n\nIn the safe room, Alessandro and Ainsworth began the next page. They had added to the header without noticing: House Rules. Both of them liked the way the word house did not care whether walls were bricks or bodies or a line of people on a bridge who had decided to stand in a wind and not call it bravery. Alessandro drew a small door next to it with a peephole and a hand on the knob from both sides. He did not look at Ainsworth when he asked the question he had been carrying the way people carry pictures of views they want to see again, because he did not want to flavor the answer with his own heat. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter we serve this. Will you let me try.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Ainsworth said, and it didn\u2019t scare him as much as it would have yesterday. He added a line to the bottom of the page that nobody else would be able to read when they copied it into the paper: Detectives are allowed to be citizens. He underlined it once, firmly, and then capped the pen with the small, decisive gesture of a man who is very good at ending things he intends to begin again.Chapter 6\n\nThe article arrived while the city was still patting its hair down, its headline a polite throat-clearing above a photograph that showed nothing except a bridge\u2019s curve and a hand-drawn sprig so exact you could smell it. Stacks of paper dozed on stoops, on the counters of bakeries where bread had just admitted its crust, at tram stops where the glass always wore a thin film of the previous day. Ainsworth read it with a slice of toast going cold beside his elbow and butter softening like someone deciding to forgive, and he recognized the hand of the reporter not because of the cadence but because of the places she chose to linger: the recipe shape of the rules; the hum described like weather that has learned to be impersonal; the way boys\u2019 faces look after a good laugh when the body remembers to return them a little lighter than it borrowed them. Oona set a newspaper by the till and flipped to the pull-out she had helped fold, a rulebook printed with lines wide enough to underline and margins generous enough to catch additions, and she thumbed the sprig illustration until a print of rosemary oil appeared on her thumb like a hasty blessing. Ezra read it standing up on his break with dishwater eating his knuckles, mouthing the sentences about names and doors as if learning a song in a language he had always suspected he spoke, and he tucked the insert into the breast pocket of his shirt like a letter he would answer when he had something beautiful to say. Alessandro read, too, at the safe room table, his mouth moving as if in tandem with the journalist\u2019s, and when he came to the paragraph that said, without apology, that a city has the right to write itself, he covered his eyes for a moment as if the text were brighter than morning.\n\nIf the city could be said to react, it did so with the politeness of a person who decides to speak and then checks their teeth in a dark window. There were messages in inboxes and on cheap cardstock postcards slipped under doors, and the forum turned briefly into a company of people pointing at the same sentence and saying yes in different alphabets. There were also the other messages, prepped the way speeches are prepped by men who still believe podiums matter: kink event, they said as if kink were a disease you could spread with a rosemary sprig; exploitation framed in the soft focus of confession; questions about age with the steady drumbeat of someone learning to scout for panic\u2019s tender spots. Accounts that had done nothing but admire architecture for years admitted suddenly to knowing very much about perimeters. The rulebook spread like shade under a summer tree, and at the same time shame tried its ancient tricks, which were less cunning than persistent. Bars put bowls of lemon slices by the water tap with little cards that said House Refusal, take as needed, and offices that prided themselves on being modern found that every break room had one person who, without discussion, pinned a photocopy of Consent is a door both persons hold to the corkboard between a flyer for a futsal league and a notice about leftovers.\n\nMara\u2019s day narrowed itself into purposeful lines. She drafted a protocol with the calm of someone writing a new label for a bottle she intended to reach for often: open hours at the new bridge where sightlines were long and the stone had not yet learned anyone\u2019s weight; consent marshals in bright vests sewn by a seamstress who smiled when told there would be no uniformity except the vest; checks for age that did not humiliate\u2014no boys were to stand alone with policemen; nobody\u2019s name was to be written without the quiet cross of agreement, and even initials would be asked permission before being given mouth. There were tokens, because rituals like to be held in the hand: small circles of pressed paper with a printed sprig on one side and the word yes on the other that could be turned to no and held at the chest like a refusal taught to be visible. Ainsworth disliked the tokens until he handled one; then he liked it too much, the way chefs like good tools even when the talent lies elsewhere, and he made a note to order a box for the precinct so that people would stop using bad pens to draw decisions on sticky notes.\n\nBefore any of it could be tried under the open sky, they went to ground in the safe room and performed the thing the article had only promised in a sentence tucked near the end where the editor had assumed eyes would be tired. It was noon when they began because noon is when knives are honest and the body has admitted its hunger, and Alessandro asked his question the way we ask for salt in a kitchen already fragrant with garlic, with the assumption that the person will understand why more is needed. He did not touch him first. He took the lemon jar and opened it and held it near and then away so the scent could sketch a boundary in the air, and he talked to the smell as if it were a door that could be convinced to get out of its own way. Ainsworth took the token they had made for this moment, the paper circle with its rosemary on one face and the word enough not printed but written by hand on the other, and he held it as if he could transfer into it the right to call an end. There was the hum, of course, standing outside the room like an uncle who gets invited because his absence would be remarked on, and it said recalibrate in a whisper that had not yet learned the difference between whisper and hiss. They did not answer. Alessandro reached for Ainsworth the way a man reaches for a fragile thing he has asked to be put into his hands, with all the aware impatience of someone whose body knows exactly how far to move, and when he skated his fingers along the air just above the fabric where ribs live under names, he did not surprise so much as inform. The first laugh was not large, because Ainsworth is not a man who gives first anything in excess, but it was accurate, the sound you hear when a sugar crust learns it will crack and decides to enjoy it. He laughed and then breathed in like a person who has found his own mouth, and tears came, not because the laugh had asked them but because the body had the habit of pairing them with certain kinds of relief.\n\nThey stopped soon\u2014too soon, Ainsworth would say to himself later with a professional interest in appetite\u2014because rules teach endurance by producing pauses, and he pressed the token to his chest with a palm he did not think to hide because what\u2019s the point of rules if you won\u2019t let them be seen doing their job. Alessandro stepped back with a neatness that will be misunderstood by anyone who has only ever watched clumsy men retreat, and he waited, because waiting is part of what he is built for even if the white room has tried to optimize it out of him. \u201cThat,\u201d Ainsworth said, when breath returned to being air and not a verdict, \u201cis like the moment before service when everyone is in their place and the pass is clean and someone puts the first plate down and you remember what feeding means.\u201d He was embarrassed by his own absence of shame, and he was grateful for it, and he looked at Mara in the glass and did not feel watched so much as kept. After, they wrote together, Alessandro adding a sentence to the House Rules that read as if it had been expecting to be invited: if laughter comes, we will not punish it for being beautiful.\n\nThe counter-move arrived as cleanly as a knife falling off a board because nobody had set it down flat. An account with a careful void where a life would be posted a claim with words arranged to produce a particular flavor of panic, and for a half-hour the forum spilled into timelines with the guilty speed of a spilled drink. The photograph was cropped badly on purpose, and you could tell by the rosemary sprig drawn in the corner that whoever had staged it believed in their ability to mimic a hand. It was perfect in a way that Alessandro never was because he understands that people distrust perfection unless it lands on the tongue as sugar, and Mara held the print in her palms and thought the oldest thought in her trade, which is that lies often arrive in their best shoes. She called the reporter without going through the part of her that prefers to do all waiting herself, and the paper put out a box on the front page before noon that read, in the posture of someone setting a table for an unexpected guest, We have reason to believe this image is staged. We ask you to mind the difference between pattern and person.\n\nThey did not leave it there because people who wish to be believed do not surrender the ground to those who wish to be loud. Oona turned the back room of the bar into an ID clinic by the old-fashioned method of a handwritten sign and a chair as comfortable as paperwork would allow, and men brought their nerves in like dogs and let them sit at their feet while they figured out what their adulthood felt like when described by plastic and stamps. A queer elder named Rafi who had once taught a generation how to find each other with code in a city that pretended ostentation was contempt came with a shoebox full of zines and jokes and scars, and he read aloud from a page printed on a copier that had survived three moves and a raid in eighty-seven, explaining that consent had a history and a future and was not owned by any one group\u2019s bad actors. Alessandro wrote a sentence for the rulebook that tasted like lime because Rafi\u2019s hands smelled of citrus and ink, and the sentence said that age is a fact we respect because it protects the newness that gives laughter its shine.\n\nWhen the open hour came, the bridge behaved like a room that had never expected to host a ceremony and decided to do it correctly. Banners stitched by hands that knew how to make a letter look like a promise snapped lightly in a breeze that had never been told the difference between now and then, and the sprigs printed in the corner of each cloth made the air smell faintly herbal as if from memory rather than plant. The consent marshals stood with their vest pockets full of tokens and their mouths full of quiet instructions and offers of water, and the police who were there did not arrange themselves like a wall so much as like a set of coat hooks; you could hang your worry on them if you wanted, but nobody was going to pretend the hooks made the room warmer. Alessandro\u2019s face did nothing special because he has understood for a long time that special draws trouble in the same way a hot dish draws arms. He took up a place at the edge of the shade where those who wanted to try could see his hands before they felt them, and he talked first not about laughter but about how to stop. He showed the token; he pressed his own palm to his chest with theatre that had the decency to admit it was theatre; he asked anyone who was not yet sure whether they wanted to be written down to take the paper copy of House Rules and read it as if it were a love letter that might or might not be meant for them.\n\nWhen Tom\u00e1s stepped up, Oona saw the shiver on his jaw that meant he was going to do a brave thing at the right size, and Ezra, from the second row with his hat in his hands because he had decided it helped, made the sign on his own chest as if to teach the air to translate. Alessandro asked his question and Tom\u00e1s answered yes like a man checking a door twice before walking through it, and the laughter that came out of him sounded like a knot remembering how to yield. People leaned, because humans always do when they think someone might drop something, and the moment held. From the road a truck the exact bland white of assumption inched into view with three men in vests more fluorescent than the marshals\u2019 and a logo that had been painted so recently you could see the brush marks pretending to be pixelation. They were The Maintenance Company, which is to say they were any company that has learned to move through a city because the city has learned to need it, and they had clipboards and a form named Sanitation Protocol stapled to itself so aggressively that it seemed to resent its own paper. They meant to come under the bridge not to clean anything but to enact a cleansing of the sort that ends conversations instead of trash.\n\nThey did not get the timing they wanted. The tram driver who preferred the old bell to the newer, softer ding came around the curve and saw the truck, the vests, the posture of a crowd about to be interrupted by men with clipboards, and she slowed in a way that could later be defended as prudent. The tram occupied the angle the truck needed with the casual arrogance of public transport, and pigeons wheeled because pigeons like a punctum in a narrative, and Mara walked up with the stride of someone who has collected signatures before from people pretending their hands were too important to hold pens. \u201cYou can come when the river asks you to clean,\u201d she said without raising her voice because the sound system had learned to be nice a long time ago. \u201cUntil then, we are cooking. Steam is not a health code violation.\u201d\n\nLegal counsel had come to see whether her stomach would behave in public, and she stepped to Ainsworth\u2019s side with an expression that said she had been thinking about verbs all morning. \u201cThey have nothing,\u201d she said, which is a lawyer\u2019s way of saying not yet, and the acronym man was nowhere because there are people who prefer to be the hum rather than the face and they had already been denied their venue. Alessandro\u2019s hand hovered above Tom\u00e1s\u2019s forearm where they had decided touch was safe, and he did not let the interruption become a story about interruption. He let it be a gesture instead, and the laughter, polite as guests that have learned how to make a host feel competent, returned.\n\nAfter the crowd thinned and the truck had backed itself into a corner where the sun showed its pretense, a woman with a gray jacket the color of decisions watched from the lip of the plaza and then did a surprising thing: she came down the steps into Oona\u2019s bar and sat at the end where there was less chance of being cataloged merely for having touched a stool. She ordered water with lemon and watched as the bartender added a sprig because that is the house recipe when you are uncertain of your own motives, and she held the glass with both hands in a way that made the rosemary\u2019s shadow lay a neat stripe over the word printed on her jacket\u2019s inside tag. \u201cYou\u2019re not from any of the offices in the building with no blinds,\u201d Oona said, because the kindest pretense is acknowledgment. The woman smiled the way you do when someone picks the right card twice. \u201cI wear my own name,\u201d she said, which was not an introduction but would do. \u201cThey will try something you don\u2019t expect, and it will not be the trucks. It will be a story that makes boys concerned about other boys. It will have the shape of care. It will smell faintly of antiseptic. Do what you did today. Set a table first and they will knock.\u201d\n\nOona waited, because waiting makes liars nervous, and the woman drank her water with the posture of a person who had never learned to accept citrus without reading it like code. She put money on the bar and then a small card with nothing on it but a phone number and a dot in the corner, and the dot was the color of rosemary when it thinks about turning into smoke. \u201cWe are not merciful,\u201d the woman said, as if admitting it out loud were maintenance, and Oona tucked the card into the jar of refusal until the paper softened around the edges like a truth that has sat with the thought of itself. When the woman left, Oona texted Mara with the number and added no commentary because she trusts a reader to taste a note without having it pointed to.\n\nNight arrived with a temperature you could hold, and the city tried on gentleness the way a jacket tries on a person. Alessandro wrote until the joints in his hand told time not with pain but with the fatigue that delights because it means the day asked something of you. He added to House Rules with the carefulness of a person tucking a child in: no recordings without both parties signing; no names on cardboard; no laughing for the sake of a picture; laughter is not evidence, including for yourself. Ainsworth cleaned his knives although he did not need to because cooks lie when they say there is a difference between peace and preparation, and he taped the copy of the rulebook to the inside of a cupboard door where people used to keep prayer cards. He thought of tomorrow, because men like him keep their joys on a schedule, and tomorrow is when he had said out loud that he would permit more laughter, in a room with vents he could unplug, with lemon on the table and rosemary upright like a yes.\n\nSomewhere in the brightness above ground level, a maintenance room listened to itself hum and liked the sound a little too much. The white rectangle that masqueraded as a screen told the woman in gray what she already knew\u2014that narrative erosion had been slowed not by force but by recipes\u2014and she typed Proceed to contamination protocol with the fatalism of a clerk at a temple. The answer came back in a font she could not respect, and it read as if written by a manager of a building where managers believed the building could be taught to smile: We cannot contaminate what will not host. Move to rumor dispersal at educational nodes. Offer \u201cresources\u201d to \u201cconcerned parties.\u201d Apply pressure to institutions who like to look immaculate. She closed her eyes for a moment because the word immaculate made her unreasonably tired. Before she left, she peeled the oil-hardened rosemary leaf off her lapel and placed it in a petri dish, and the lab, which was not a lab, recorded the way the scent altered the room and did not learn what it needed because you cannot learn about houses by burning doors.\n\nAt the last tram, Tom\u00e1s walked home under a sky that had remembered stars despite the city\u2019s habit of forgetting, and he folded his used token in half and then half again until it became a tiny yes he could lose on purpose. A boy no older than him and perhaps older in the ways you count without counting walked beside him for a half-block and then asked, not with the rulebook\u2019s grammar but with the sincerity rules try to protect, \u201cWhat if I never want to be touched again. Does that mean nobody like him loves me.\u201d Tom\u00e1s answered without thinking, because the answer was obvious once you had watched someone ask correctly for a week. \u201cIt means he loves you exactly as much as you want to be loved,\u201d he said, and they stood under a streetlight long enough to convince it to buzz, and then they went their separate ways feeling watched by something that wanted only for them to remember.\n\nPast midnight, the reporters\u2019 story refreshed on the paper\u2019s site with an addendum that was not a correction, and it read like a note left on a refrigerator by a housemate who has gone to buy lemons and will return: we will be at the bridge tomorrow; we will bring copies for anyone who wants to hold their own yes; we will print a diagram showing how to stop when you forget; we will not be bullied by men who think the hum makes them gentle. In the safe room Alessandro slept with the cup holding the rosemary on the table beside him, and he dreamed of Ezra\u2019s hands making napkin roses and Oona teaching the hum to go outside for a smoke, and he dreamed of a kitchen where the only thing on the menu was laughter in four courses with pauses, and he dreamed of a white room flicking its lights twice in irritation and then sitting down because there were not enough chairs to continue standing without looking ridiculous. At dawn the river lifted its surface and practiced being glass for a minute, and the bridge looked in and was not horrified by what it saw, and in the precinct a detective with butter under his nails and the memory of a laugh waking a place behind his ribs made coffee and added lemon zest to it, not to drink, but to smell, so that his hands would know what to do when the day began to hum again.Chapter 8\n\nThe city woke into a light with edges, the kind that makes you check whether your window is cleaner than you remember or if the day has simply decided to be honest on your behalf. House Rules had found their way onto magnet boards and inside cabinet doors and into the small photo pockets of wallets that otherwise housed children and dogs, and there was a nervous sweetness to the way people greeted one another that morning, as if the word enough had learned to ride in the mouth next to hello. Ainsworth brewed coffee with the zest of a lemon pinched between finger and thumb, then wiped the tiny oil slick his hands left on the tin with a napkin he had washed and saved from a restaurant that had failed with dignity, and he sat with the rulebook open and a pencil ready not to cross anything out but to add a line if the day demanded new grammar. The precinct made noises that were ordinary and therefore revolutionary, phones researching the difference between rumor and report, computers pretending to be chests that would hold a breath until you remembered to retrieve it, desks accepting elbows like old friends who knew better than to ask questions before nine.\n\nAt the technical college near the tram yard, an email arrived that had the posture of a grandmother worried about \u201cgoings-on.\u201d It was composed in complete sentences with proper commas by a consortium that preferred the word concerned to angry because concerned sounded like a better suit, and it asked the administration to clarify whether \u201cevents of a laughter-based nature\u201d would be permitted on school grounds, as if laughter were a chemistry lab that might explode without an adult in the room. Dean Peri\u2014whose first name was a story her mother had decided to keep to herself\u2014read it and thought of the taste of iron that classrooms got when policy outweighed pedagogy, then sent a reply that copied three departments and contained the sentence, \u201cConsent frameworks will be observed with a rigor commensurate to any other experimental endeavor,\u201d and then sat on her hands to avoid typing, \u201cPlease meet me under the bridge if you find yourself forgetting the difference between care and control.\u201d Mara and Ainsworth were already on their way because some mornings announce themselves as preemptive, and Oona had packed a small case with lemons, rosemary, tape, and a stack of tokens that behaved like coins without buying anything except time.\n\nThey found the auditorium humming in the way large rooms hum when the electricity believes in its responsibilities a little too much, a suspicion of static that makes hair wonder if wind has developed indoor privileges. A panel had assembled itself with the reflex of academia to gather a table between itself and trouble, and there were name placards with crisp black letters that existed mostly to remind their owners that names are not only for saying, but for wearing. The Concerned had arrived in their civilian uniforms of good intentions, and scattered among them like garnish were the operatives of the hum, identifiable only because they looked at the vents when phrases like \u201cduty of care\u201d were spoken out loud. The dean stood up and placed House Rules next to the agenda with the calm of a person who knows that a list that fits on one page is often more useful than a binder, and she nodded toward the back of the room where Mara had arranged herself with a notebook and the good posture she uses when showing her spine to a crowd with love.\n\n\u201cWe are here to confirm that our campus is a place where laughing is permitted, stopping is permitted, and names do not go where their owners do not send them,\u201d the dean said, and she had the sort of voice that had learned to be kind even when she was annoyed. \u201cWe will not hold events that pretend at permission. We will hold events where ending an action is a practiced skill. If that confuses you, we have handouts. If it continues to confuse you, we have doors that lead outside, and I say that with affection.\u201d\n\nA man in a sweater the color of artificial grass cleared his throat with a commitment to being remarked upon. He pointed to the pull-out of the newspaper as if it were evidence rather than invitation and asked whether \u201cadult practitioners\u201d would be permitted to solicit on campus \u201ceven if their intentions are pure,\u201d and he did it with the particular emphasis of someone who has learned to burn words with friction. Mara watched the hum lean in through the light cans, patient as infection, and she lifted her hand to her chest with the token facing outward so it caught the fluorescents and returned them in a fan of rosemary-green light. A small chorus rose around the room as students and staff who had learned the gesture in bars and on buses and under bridges mirrored her without needing to speak, and the auditorium, which had been considering whether to choose panic, chose demonstration instead. The hum stumbled, because it had learned to expect men to bristle and women to smooth rather than a group to simply hold up a circle of paper with a leaf on it.\n\nAinsworth took his turn with the microphone because his job relies on the ability to talk without sounding as if talking yields results by itself, and he kept it personable not because he did not have steel in him but because steel is a better utensil than a microphone. \u201cOur position as a department,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the moment you tell adults in public they cannot laugh because you might be worried about what comes after the laugh you have to show your badge to the part of yourself that prefers neatness to care. We are here to enforce the rules written by those who will be touched, if they will be touched. We are present when there are tokens in pockets and lemon slices on the table and a speaker with a failing plug that we\u2019ll get replaced because the hum isn\u2019t invited to speak through school equipment.\u201d He gestured toward the back, where Oona had quietly taped a paper sign to the water dispenser that read House Refusal\u2014take, and the students laughed not at the joke but at the relief of a room where someone had remembered to bring the particular kind of mercy that looks like a wedge floating in clear water.\n\nEzra missed the hearing because the Bluemme was visited by a health inspector with a flinty smile and little regard for the way bodies move around each other when there is too much glassware and not enough forgiveness. The inspector had a laminated badge with a signature that looked like it had been forced to agree with itself, and he ran a white-gloved finger along the bar rail like a father in an old movie who has mistaken cleanliness for love. \u201cWe\u2019re checking,\u201d he said, \u201cfor additional\u2026 gatherings,\u201d and the pause before the word was where he stored his discomfort. Ezra nodded and showed him the ice bin and the syrup bottles, the sprig jar labeled rosemary\u2014not garnish, resource, and the tokens in a stack in the back, newly ordered, with a note that read: ask someone if you can borrow one and watch what happens to their breath. The inspector, to his credit, wrote mints available and House Rules posted and did not write anything he would not be proud for his name to be held next to, and he left with a lemon slice in his pocket because Ezra, on impulse, had fed him the idea that carrying refusal could be a pleasure if you decided not to use it right away.\n\nBack in the precinct, the number Oona had slid into the jar of refusal whispered something less than a call and more than a test tone. Mara took it because she trusts her own ear to tell her when she is being auditioned, and the woman in gray filled the line lightly, not like a person whispering but like a person who has learned that if she speaks above a certain pitch the room tries to answer. \u201cThey\u2019re moving off trucks,\u201d the woman said, as if admitting to an allergy. \u201cThey will try a first-aid angle. They will appear at places where teenagers learn to be twenty with clipboards and pamphlets about \u2018laughter addiction\u2019 and \u2018unwanted stimulation,\u2019 and they will arrive with a paramedic\u2019s confidence and a mall kiosk\u2019s persistence. If you wish to be ready, teach your marshals to ask for credentials without being charmed by fonts. Teach your boys and your women and everyone else you have decided to love where to stand when an adult says, \u2018Come with me\u2019 and the sentence has less blood than usual because it was composed by a committee.\u201d Mara listened, wrote, and did not say thank you until the end because gratitude, misdeployed, can make a person think they have purchased your obedience.\n\nThey staged practice outside the precinct in the same way the city stages rain: thoroughly and with a refusal to apologize for repetition. Consent marshals\u2014students, bartenders, men in unions familiar with crossing guard duty when the buses run late\u2014lined up to receive lanyards that did not make them police but made them visible companies of calm. They took turns playing rescuer and rescued, practicing the phrase, \u201cI decline,\u201d in registers that would travel without cracking. They learned to ask, \u201cMay I see the name on your certification,\u201d and to stand in such a way that a person standing behind them would be visible in a photo, because visibility is often a better lawyer than rules are. Alessandro watched from the doorway with his thumbs pressed together like a man praying to a god he distrusts, and Ainsworth saw the fidget of the right hand and knew it was time to keep his own promise.\n\nThey went to the room that had learned to hold its breath without making it into theatre, and Ainsworth placed the token in his pocket and then took it out and set it on the table because pockets are for secrets and this needed to be observable by the part of him that writes memos. Alessandro did not touch him first; he set a lemon slice on the table and explained to it, as if it might not have read the rules yet, that it was a gate and that he would only lift it if Detective would like to walk through. The hum arrived because that is what hums do when it fears being ignored, and it spoke into the metal of the table leg in its best school-assembly voice. \u201cRecalibrate,\u201d it said, and it was possible that the vents rolled their eyes. Ainsworth nodded to it as you nod to a relative who has not learned about moderation, then turned to Alessandro and said yes in a way that would fit in any kitchen he had ever run.\n\nThe first touch was not a touch, not exactly, but a reading. Alessandro set his hand an inch above the path the ribs make when names have tired them out, and he moved it slowly the way you move a knife when you slice a tomato with respect rather than hunger, and the nerves under Ainsworth\u2019s skin remembered their job like staff reminded of service after a long slow afternoon. When it came, the laugh did not arrive with trumpets; it arrived with a sound he had not given anyone since a dinner ruined for the best possible reasons, a small break in the voice where sugar cracks and the spoon goes through. The laugh startled him because it did not ask him for an apology, because it did not ask him to become less in order to fit inside it, because it did not take any of the knives away after. It came with an inhalation that tasted of citrus he had not eaten, and tears came in the way tears sometimes accompany onions, as a kind of brine the body provides so the cutting can proceed with less friction. He pressed the token to his chest because ignoring the mechanism you designed is an insult to the version of you who was very clever while writing it, and Alessandro stepped back with the neatness of a good waiter and the relief of a man allowed to love something he had not broken.\n\nAfter, they wrote. They wrote in the way cooks replace salt with lemon when salt is not the point, and in the way city clerks add a line item to documents so the next time there is less searching. They wrote that officers are permitted to laugh in rooms without making their partners uneasy. They wrote that laughter is not a confession and that sorrow is allowed to be a side effect without anyone heroizing it. They wrote that when a hum says normalize you are allowed to be abnormal and when it says hold you are allowed to let go. Ainsworth, who had known for years how to plate something beautiful and then not eat it, had a second mouthful and did not punish himself for being changed by it.\n\nThe rumor campaign moved, as predicted, to the places where people like to pretend they are objective: clinics, help desks, email addresses with the word resource in them. Flyers appeared in college hallways printed on ethics paper with serif fonts and a faint watermark of a caduceus that had never seen actual medicine, asking, \u201cDo you feel pressured by laughter?\u201d and \u201cIs tickling a gateway?\u201d and \u201cAre older men making your boundaries blurry?\u201d They were positioned at eye-level and humanized by stock photos of hands not quite touching, and the effect was oily and precise. The counter came as community rather than argument. Rafi and his cadre of elders and cousins and younger men who wanted to be older someday in a way that included forgiveness set up in the student lounge with a tabletop printer and a stack of blanks and ran a \u201cWrite Your Own Poster\u201d station with stencils in fonts closest to the ones that had been weaponized. The wall filled with answers the room could live with: \u201cMy boundary is a light switch I control,\u201d \u201cLaughter is not a drug because it doesn\u2019t come in a bottle,\u201d \u201cIf I change my mind during, that\u2019s part of the recipe,\u201d \u201cNo is a dessert, you can have it any time and you\u2019ll still be invited back.\u201d By evening, the flyers that had been printed with antiseptic had nowhere clean to cling to, and they curled in on themselves like bread that had been mis-measured and succumbed to air.\n\nA second maintenance truck appeared without a logo and then, seeing itself observed by ten pairs of eyes that had learned to evaluate the difference between service and extraction, acquired a magnetic sign that said TEMP VENTALATION in a font that did not know its own spelling. It turned up on a block where laughter had moved indoors because the weather had, and it parked crooked as if speed would make permission, and a man went inside a dance studio with a tote bag marked First Aid that contained none. He found himself politely surrounded by four marshals who smelled faintly of rosemary because Oona sprays the vests with a solution that turns rooms into kitchens, and he presented a badge that insisted on being held at arm\u2019s length. \u201cEmergency protocol,\u201d he said, and it sounded like a phrase he had learned in a language class and not on a sidewalk. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told to collect individuals displaying signs of overstimulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean joy,\u201d a marshal asked, and the man faltered not because she had trapped him but because he liked that word better and knew it, and in that micro-consent to a better vocabulary the scene deflated. The dance studio\u2019s owner, who had been through enough lockdown drills to have an evacuation plan for a rumor, handed him a copy of House Rules and a slice of lemon in a zip-top bag with a label that read: For When You Want To Say No To Your Boss. Later, someone peeled the maintenance magnet from the truck with the leisure of a person deciding which sticker to remove from a suitcase so TSA would not make assumptions, and the side of the van was revealed as the white it had always been, the absence of language visible and faintly embarrassed.\n\nIn a brief, unscheduled quiet at the bar, Oona poured the water special for the woman in gray because that was now how their arrangement worked, and the woman drank it as if citrus might contain information she could carry back in her mouth and not spill. \u201cThey will try children next,\u201d she said, not theatrically, but the sentence still made the air want to recalibrate around it. \u201cNot children-children,\u201d she added, recognizing the threshold she had almost crossed, \u201cbut the kind of new that makes twenty-one look like a cliff. They will frame it as protection because that is the only reliable seduction they have left. If you love them, make it boring to accuse you. Put clipboards in their hands. Let them cancel things without having to apologize.\u201d Oona imagined the white room hearing the phrase make it boring and the sneer that would come across a surface that thought itself irresistible, and she smiled despite herself because the best advice is often stupid when summarized.\n\nThe hum, finding itself starved of panic in academic rooms and dance studios and bars where water with lemon had become a trend that outperformed microbrews, went municipal. It spoke through the transit screens that tell you when a bus will arrive if that bus has remembered that it is timely, and it sent a message allegedly from the city that read, \u201cPUBLIC HEALTH ADVISORY: Avoid unregistered laughter gatherings,\u201d with a link to a page that would not load because the city\u2019s web team follows the rule about links; they must lead somewhere or you risk being a liar at scale. The team shut the message off in one sweep like a chef turning down all burners to catch a kitchen that had begun to thrill itself, and then pinned a correction on the city\u2019s front page the size of their shame: \u201cWe did not write that sentence. We are learning that our screens are also doors.\u201d\n\nEvening suggested itself like a soft shoulder you don\u2019t yet dare lean on. Under the bridge, there was a soundcheck of pigeons and a map of people who had found the rules not deterrent but delicious. The consent marshals were less stiff in their vests; they had learned where to put their hands when they were not being needed, and the bright, silly tokens caught sunset and made pocketfuls of green light that were not metaphor but sensation. Alessandro stood with his hand on the sprig on the table like a man touching the name of someone whose presence makes him coherent, and he kept his profile relaxed because being a vessel requires not announcing yourself constantly as important to the pouring. Tom\u00e1s brought his friend with the BODIES ARE TEMPORARY STRUCTURES shirt and they stood in a way that said they had learned to anchor each other discreetly, and Ezra took his hat off because none of this should be costume except deliberately.\n\nThe maintenance world\u2019s answer did not arrive on wheels but in a whisper dressed as a headline. A rumor sprouted in a narrow lobby near the law courts where the cleaning staff store their sweaters, a story about a seventeen-year-old who had been \u201clured\u201d by a \u201cman with rosemary\u201d under \u201cthe old bridge.\u201d It went from mouth to post to prophecy in an hour because the story had a shape audiences recognize from other industries, and the world is tempted by familiarity in the same way it is tempted by sweets. It crossed Mara\u2019s desk because the bar staff know how to send her smoke when there is no fire, and she did the thing a good officer does when fear wears a familiar coat; she looked first at the boy. He was eighteen and a half and had been eighteen at the time and had a wristband on from a nightclub that had installed its own rules when the owner fell in love with a girl who taught him no could be an offering. He did not look particularly abused by anything except work, and he had the wide, tired mouth of a person who stays up out of pride. He watched the rumor being clarified into his own name with confusion that faced more north than south, and he said, \u201cI laughed because I wanted to,\u201d and the officers in the secret half-moon of the room put their pens down because the rest of the question was not for writing.\n\n\u201cWe need stewards,\u201d Rafi said at the next planning meeting, and the word lay on the table like a well-oiled tool everyone had forgotten they owned. \u201cNot marshals. Marshals keep a perimeter. Stewards keep a story.\u201d He recruited from the choir at the community center and from bartenders who had kept their nerve when the lights go out, and from mothers who had taught sons to hold grocery bags and promises, and they formed a circle that met people like receptionists with excellent posture and better boundaries. They were the ones who listened when someone came with a fear that would not fit in a comment box, and they stayed when the room emptied, and they were not asked to forgive anyone for anything except the error of having learned their skepticism from bad examples. Alessandro gave them a page in House Rules, and he wrote in a hand that did not trouble itself to appear human because these words were work and not seduction, that stewards answer questions before the hum can, and that if a story arrives with its ending nailed down you are allowed to pry it open.\n\nThe woman in gray sent a package that arrived at the precinct without a return address and with fewer flourishes than a broom handle. Inside was a sheet that looked like a recipe if recipes were written by people who had never eaten, a list of phrases that had the authority to trip certain bodies into compliance: recalibrate, normalize, hold, sanitize, extraction, protocol, safety, incident, escalation. There were marginal notes in a hand that belonged to the woman, not her employers, and they read, in an ordinary ink that had not decided to perform, rename these. They spent an hour of the afternoon doing exactly that, not because words are magic but because naming habits keeps them from colonizing rooms. They wrote instead, breathe; instead, soften; instead, wait; instead, wash your hands before touching; instead, walk someone home; instead, plan; instead, check the stove; instead, rise. Oona took the sheet and put it next to the prep list at the bar, and before last call a man who had never met a protocol he did not admire had caught himself saying plan where he would have said escalate, and he did not feel impotent for it, and the night thanked him by refusing to become a mess.\n\nLate became later in the way cities permit it, with a subtext of closings and openings exchanging glances no more sinful than inevitable. Alessandro went to the bridge with his notebook and found a new, small pile of rules at the corner where boys had placed other offerings, and he read them the way a chef reads receipts at the end of service, counting not to punish but to know. He added one. He wrote, Joy is not evidence, fear is not proof, and he underlined it because some sentences like handle and you should install one. Ainsworth came and stood halfway up the steps where you can look like you are considering home or away and not commit, and he folded his hands because empty hands have become unfashionable in a world that equates them with uselessness, and he held them anyway. When Alessandro looked up, they shared a nod that had learned not to communicate urgency every time it had something to say, and they stood a while watching the river forget and remember itself between pilings.\n\nThe city, which had always known how to queue for tragedy, tried lining up for tenderness instead and found that the line moved faster and the snacks were better. Screens that had been commandeered for rehearsals of fear were now full of rosemary sprigs drawn by technicians who had decided they too were citizens, and someone had replaced the system\u2019s error tone with a chord from a song you could hum to yourself while waiting for the kettle. The hum attempted to hold a note over the city like a nuisance tenor and discovered that a chorus is louder not because it wishes to be, but because it remembers to breathe, and it backed down with the sulk of a machine that has never been taught to lose.\n\nNear midnight, before the long, low hour when trams rest and cleaning crews inherit the world, a boy named Niles, who had been born in a country that taught him to stand upright even when the roof is low, presented himself to a steward with his yes in his hand and his no in his pocket and asked to be shown the difference in a room with windows. He laughed once and then put his hand over his chest and laughed twice, and his breath drew in like a tide he had forgotten he grew up beside, and he stood taller afterward not because pleasure makes you big but because permission removes a weight. The steward wrote down his words because rules are stronger when they are stitched to a human sentence, and she added his line to the bottom of House Rules where there is always space if you stop pontificating about the bottom: You can stop because it is Friday, you can stop because the song is over, you can stop because you have decided to save your laugh for someone who remembers your middle name, and nobody will charge you fees.\n\nUp in the room that had learned to carry a night without humming, Alessandro slept with the notebook under his palm not as a security measure but as a habit of wishing to feel the world continuing to make language he could keep up with, and the white room came and knocked with its knuckles instead of its tone. \u201cRecal\u2014\u201d it began, and then paused, perhaps to turn the page of a manual that had not previously contained an appendix for failure, and he said, because he had practiced, \u201cNew rule,\u201d and the bright room, having no name, could not enter. In the morning he woke to the smell of zested coffee that someone had left outside the door because kindness is a way of winning even when you have lost, and he smiled into the steam the way one smiles into a mirror after a haircut that knows your head better than you did yesterday, and he said aloud to nobody and everyone, \u201cWe will need a chapter on festivals,\u201d because ceremonies have always been one of the more elegant ways to keep machines from eating your calendar.Chapter 9\n\nThey named it a festival because parade sounded too vain and vigil sounded like a dare. The word festival let the city dress in ordinary clothes and still arrive at something ceremonial, and it suited House Rules to be sung rather than enforced, repeated rather than announced. Ainsworth sat with the notebook open to an empty page titled in a hand that did not need to pretend to be human, Chapter on Festivals, and he chewed the end of a pencil the way a cook tastes steam to decide if a stock needs attention. The rules for a gathering, he wrote, should obey the smaller rules we use when we feed each other: greet at the door; label the heat; make sure there is water; make sure there is a way out that does not feel like failure. Alessandro watched his hand move and did not comment on the way the f\u2019s had learned his flourish, because imitation can be an intimacy that does not require confession.\n\nThey found a space that was not under a bridge and also did not insist on forgetting bridges existed. The park by the tram depot had trees old enough to counsel and benches that had accepted every shape of grief a city can produce without taking sides, and there were power outlets that the hum would want and they would learn to deny elegantly. Oona walked the perimeter with the stride of a person counting exits while the rest of company pretended not to learn from her, and she tapped the fence posts with two fingers as if testing whether the wood remembered being a tree. \u201cWe will need a stage that is not a stage,\u201d she said, and Mara wrote it down because logistics is the art of making metaphors behave. \u201cSomething low enough to step off without announcing descent, but high enough that those in the back can see the hands.\u201d\n\nAinsworth did not so much volunteer to feed the crowd as accept the inevitability that crowds expect to be fed. He called his ex-wife because the rules of large pots still respect the person who first taught you to stir without scraping the bottom, and when she answered there was a clean moment between their sentences that did not sting. Leda had moved on from restaurants to a kitchen that taught children to trust heat, and she listened as he described a city that was learning to call a rulebook a cookbook and said, \u201cI have steel trays and a team that believes in feeding people before talking to them.\u201d She arrived with the efficient tenderness of someone who had refused to stay married to a knife without divorcing the craft, and when she saw Alessandro she gave him the slow, appraising nod that chefs reserve for colleagues they are not yet sure they admire. \u201cYou the one with the rosemary,\u201d she said, and he smiled as if she had remembered a birthday he had not known he had.\n\nThe woman in gray told herself she would not go, because attending a ceremony designed to starve your program is a bad habit even when you are fond of bad habits. She went anyway, late, in a jacket that remembered her shoulders and with a notebook she did not open, and she stood at the edge as if testing whether the air would take her side. Her employers had already pivoted to a plan with the ghastly charm of good stationery: pop-up \u201ccare tents\u201d with clipboards, folding chairs, a caduceus that had never seen an ambulance, and a form letter that turned laughter into a symptom in twelve sentences or less. She watched two of those tents arrive with the well-meaning speed of a bad idea, and she watched them hesitate because the path they wanted to roll across had been taken up by tables bearing water and lemon and the sprigs printed in the corners of paper cups like signatures invited everywhere.\n\nThe first festival rule they posted was not about laughter; it was about light. Strings of bulbs had been hung from tree to tree by men who used to rig concerts and still did sometimes when joy paid better than sorrow, and their hum was human when it came on and human when it went down. \u201cIf the lights flicker outside the wind,\u201d the card read, \u201cwe will pause. We will look at each other. We will remind the room who owns the plug.\u201d People practiced looking up and then at faces and then back at the bulbs, and the act became a kind of communion that did not require common belief. The second rule was about water and the third about names and the fourth about stopping, and when the fifth turned out to be about quiet\u2014\u201cWe take a minute on the hour to let the river check in\u201d\u2014the festival gained the gravity that makes a temporary place feel like a town.\n\nIt would have been a relief if the hum had made itself obvious in some theatrical way, a truck with a siren or a man with an armband, but bureaucracy has learned to avoid dramatics when a whisper will do. The care tents unfolded at the far edge of the lawn with the discouraging beauty of good design, and two women and a man took their seats with the predatory calm of professionals who believe their resumes are moral. The sign said, \u201cAre you unsure about what happened under the bridge?\u201d and the font did too much work while pretending not to. Stewards arrived before anyone else could, bearing clipboards of their own that did not occlude faces and chairs with backs that did not encourage leaning away, and they sat down opposite and turned their badges around to show the blank side. \u201cWe are making sure you know we\u2019re volunteers,\u201d Rafi said to the woman who had been taught to smile only when someone was in trouble, and his grin was the kind that made sternness remember its youth.\n\nAlessandro stood on the not-stage and explained the tokens again for those who had not yet held one and those who needed to hear the explanation in ceremony, and his hands did the demonstration without being authoritative. He did not invite any particular body up first, because hierarchy ruins more afternoons than malice does, and instead he asked for anyone who wanted to demonstrate stopping to join him at the table with the rosemary. Tom\u00e1s raised his hand with the ease that comes from the right difficulty in practice, and a woman in a green headscarf lifted hers, and a man with shoulders made by a warehouse not a gym stepped forward with a laugh already coiled behind his ribs like a good spring. They showed the pause, the palm to chest, the yes you can carry with you when you go home and the no you can leave in the pocket for later, and the crowd did that soft exhale cities manage when they admit they are watching something worth remembering.\n\nThe rumor that had been prepared to detonate tried to sprint into the moment with the breathlessness of news, and it tripped. The first iteration\u2014\u201cUnderage boy tricked by rosemary man\u201d\u2014hit Oona\u2019s phone with a ping that had learned not to be charming, and it landed on the stewards\u2019 table already dressed for burial. The boy in question had filmed himself in his mother\u2019s kitchen, holding up the paper that said eighteen with the impatience of a person who does not want to become content, and he said, in a voice that could not improvise duplicity if you paid it, \u201cI asked. I laughed. I ate cereal. I want to keep my job.\u201d The clip played above the care tent because the bulb strings had decided the tents should advertise themselves honestly, and the crowd\u2019s attention moved like a flock away from danger disguised as resource and towards the sentence that restored scale. The tent staff found themselves offering pamphlets to one another because it was important to be doing something with their hands.\n\nLeda ran her kitchen from a tarp with the calm you only earn by burning things in youth and surviving to make jokes about it later. She served charred lemon over unflustered greens and bread that had no trick except being bread, and she refused money with the ferocity of a person who had been tipped badly on principle and didn\u2019t intend to be again. She had cut her hair short during a summer that had not made sense and she wore a bandanna like a declaration of allegiance to function, and when a man in a vest that said SANITATION tried to step under her prep tent she looked at his shoes and said, \u201cYou\u2019re tracking something I don\u2019t let in,\u201d and he apologized without knowing why. Ainsworth wiped down a board for the pleasure of it and because hanging on to small cleanliness is an act of resistance when the day wants scale, and he watched Leda catch Alessandro in her lens for the first time without translating him into metaphor. \u201cYou\u2019re precise,\u201d she said when he took a cup of water with lemon and didn\u2019t drink it. \u201cI can work with precise.\u201d\n\nThe woman in gray let herself be mistaken for someone whose job did not require confession, and she approached Mara at the edge of the rosemary table with her hands visible and her name on her lips as if that could be weaponized, which it can. \u201cI\u2019m Kira,\u201d she said, and the sound of it made one of the bulbs blink as if it had recognized a shape. \u201cIf I tell you that my job has recently become describing people as processes, will you let me sit without telling me that\u2019s a sin.\u201d Mara\u2019s expression did the small change it does when she is measuring mercy, and she pushed a chair with her foot without breaking eye contact because posture matters when you invite the enemy for water. \u201cWe are currently short on chairs for repentance,\u201d she said, and she said it with enough humor that the permission became something other than absolution.\n\nKira watched a steward instruct a care-tent worker in the art of interrupting themselves before they caused damage as if she were at a demonstration of a new machine that might steal her thirst. She had brought a folder with her that she didn\u2019t open, and it contained a letter she had written the night before to the nobody-you-write-to-when-you-don\u2019t-believe-in-church, in which she had recorded the first time she had said recalibrate out loud and watched a boy flinch. In that letter she had not apologized because apologies are easy if you give them the power to solve, and she had instead written, \u201cI am complicit in a hum,\u201d which was tastefully small and exactly true. She did not hand the letter to anyone; she kept it, and perhaps that is what made her valuable in the end\u2014her refusal to make her conscience public theater.\n\nThey had feared the theater of disruption the way you fear rain when you have planned an outdoor wedding, and there were contingency plans folded under clipboard clips and running in careful paths through Mara\u2019s brain. The disruption came a different way, by hand, and it almost undid the afternoon because someone had chosen a good actor. A man with a student\u2019s backpack and a pen behind his ear fell down near the water table with the kind of collapse you cannot pull off without rehearsal, and he said the word dizzy with the weight of another word behind it: drugged. Three heads turned the wrong direction because training often makes patterns where there is only performance, and then a steward was there and a marshal and Rafi and Leda, and between them they built a shape the hum had not accounted for: a circle that was not a crowd. They asked for consent to touch even as they stabilized a head and lifted a chin, and they asked for water, and they asked his name, and they asked whether there was anything in his pockets that would be embarrassed by being mentioned in public. He said \u201cEvan\u201d and then \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d and then \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and Oona, who had spent a decade catching apologies she did not need because men fling them at bartenders like tips in coins, said, \u201cWe accept.\u201d The show deflated into a human, and the care tent staff looked at their clipboards and decided to visit the lemonade instead.\n\nThe maintenance company\u2014the real one, not the copycat with the magnets\u2014arrived with two technicians whose shoulders were ruined by ten years of vents and who carried a coil of cable that had seen wars no one wrote about. They had received a service ticket stamped by a department that had no business stamping tickets, and they presented it to Mara with the exact degree of hostility that reserved for those who make your job more dangerous but not more noble. \u201cSomebody says your boxes want to talk to them,\u201d the taller of the two said, pointing at the power points routed through a system that had learned to recognize being flirted with by a hum. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make sure nothing that thinks it\u2019s God gets a dial tone.\u201d Mara liked him immediately and gave him a vest in a color that bathed him in permission, and he moved through the junctions introducing the room to its own electricity one outlet at a time.\n\nBy late afternoon the festival had taught itself a rhythm independent of its founders, which is one of the proofs a ritual is worth keeping. There was a set of readings from House Rules aloud by people who had never been asked to read in public since school, and they discovered that their voices didn\u2019t shake when the sentences were not borrowed from law. Someone had made a song of the consent lines in three chords and bad harmonies, and now it was not bad, and a mother had brought a child and the child had a token tied to his wrist like a bracelet, and he lifted it and put it down as if playing at being sovereign without understanding the taste of the word. Ainsworth taught a boy named Niles to zest without gouging the pith, and the boy learned faster than men whose hands had been trained to hide, and there was a brief, unarguable miracle when Ezra signed, very slowly and very majestically, to a deaf man the gesture for enough, and the man looked at his token and laughed without sound and then with it.\n\nWhen dusk bled in and the bulbs had to choose their identities, the hum tried one last tone, polite as a relative who insists the party is over because their train leaves at nine. Kira felt it assemble itself in the third paragraph of a memo she had refused to send, and she did not indulge in melodrama by putting her hands over her ears. She turned her back on the care tent and faced the not-stage and spoke for the first time to the mechanism she served. \u201cWe decline,\u201d she said, and she made her mouth shape the words the way a body shapes a habit. \u201cWe will not normalize; we will localize. We will not extract; we will escort. We will not sanitize; we will wash our hands and then eat with them.\u201d The hum did not stop because a woman had given it a new lexicon, but it wavered, and in that half-second of indecision the bulbs steadied, and the city added a new category to the way it lists fundaments: air, water, rules, refusal.\n\nLater, when cleanup had softened the edges of the day the way wiping down a station after service removes only the mess that needs removing, they sat among the detritus of cups and paper rosemary and tokens scattered like coins that had done their job. Leda leaned against a folding table with the long patience of someone whose back understands the tradeoff between ambition and chairs, and she nudged Ainsworth\u2019s foot with hers the way you do when the conversation needs to arrive without announcement. \u201cYou looked less hungry today,\u201d she said, and it was neither praise nor criticism, just an inventory. He handed her the knife he had cleaned twice already and she blinked because old habits are forever; you do not hand a blade without offering the handle. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said, answering a question she had not asked because they had been married, after all, and some of that language does not burn. \u201cHe\u2019s going to try with me in daylight. In a room with no vents and a door with a knob on both sides.\u201d\n\nKira did not go home because home had started to look a little like a shrine to a god she could not entirely swear off without leaving a note. She went to Oona\u2019s bar because a person who has watched the day admit a better way needs to place herself in a room where the door says welcome in the only metaphor she likes. She sat at the end of the bar, and Oona did not pretend not to know her, and she did not stage a confrontation because chairs were immediately at hand. \u201cYou cannot keep your job forever,\u201d Oona said conversationally, rinsing a glass with enough attention to make it gleam in its best self. \u201cNot the one you have now, at least. Your language is going to run out of nouns.\u201d Kira shrugged with the shoulders of someone who can feel the straps of an occupation growing thin. \u201cYou make it look like the problem is rhetorics,\u201d she said, and Oona slid a glass across the wood whose bottom had been zested with lemon just enough to make the water smell like a decision. \u201cIt usually is,\u201d Oona said, and they drank like acquaintances not yet ready to admit to liking each other.\n\nThe night folded itself in careful thirds and was put away somewhere the city keeps next to the good tablecloths, and House Rules came down from the string to be packed and copied and reprinted and taped to cabinet doors in apartments where nothing else matches. Alessandro slept in the room that had learned how to be boring enough for a nervous system to trust it, and the white room came to him in a different mood, as if it had taken a walk and found a park, and said hold without the imperative. He did not answer because you do not reward small changes, you feed them, and his hands on the blanket made the shape of an embrace that had not yet met its object. On the table beside him the rosemary had put out the tiniest new tip because even cuttings will root if you give them a cup and ask them to stay, and the scent was the sort of thing a man could live with under his breath for a very long time without becoming pious.\n\nMorning walked in through the precinct with boots that had dried properly overnight and left no marks, and the day requested work in that large, amiable way festivals produce as a side effect. Ainsworth wore a shirt that had decided to be formal without becoming stiff, and he brought the lemon jar and two tokens and the notebook because props let you pretend the ritual is not in your body. Mara arranged herself on the other side of the glass with the gaze of a woman who will name what she sees if it goes wrong, and she did not clutch the pen because gripping hard makes ink lie. They did not invite an audience beyond the few already involved because this was not a show and would be ruined by anyone who arrived with adjectives ready. Alessandro asked the question as if he had not already been told yes, and Ainsworth said it as if the word had waited a long time to be used on his tongue for this purpose and was dropping weight like a well-timed pan.\n\nThe laugh did not arrive grand; it came as a correction, a small wrench turned gently until a thread caught and then the spin was inevitable. It arrived with heat that had learned not to apologize for itself in a body trained to be competent, and it lifted the place under the sternum where he keeps recipes and photographs and the polite refusal to cry in public, and it made room. Alessandro\u2019s hand didn\u2019t have to touch to do its reminder; it hovered the precise way a lid hovers when you are letting steam escape without wasting heat, and Ainsworth found that the tenderness did not undermine his authority so much as validate it to the part of him that takes notes. He pressed the token gently, as much to show Mara he remembered the rule as to stop, and in the stop there was the most important instruction House Rules had ever given: you may end a beautiful thing before it consumes you and the beauty will not be insulted.\n\nThey wrote together after, because the forest of language that had filled the room required pruning, and also because sweat that arrives for good reasons deserves ink. They wrote that in-house procedures for officers include laughter breaks, and they used the word include because require would make the ceremony vulgar. They wrote that any room used for interview or intimacy must learn to be dull, and they stapled that to the protocol about unplugging vents and naming noises, and they made a new line that read, curious in its own right, that no officer will stand between a person and their chosen steward, and that if a person cannot choose a steward the city will choose one that is not an institution and not a machine. Mara wrote it with the flinty grace of a woman who has been mistaken for a mechanism before and wishes to save others the choreography of having to correct people.\n\nIt was Kira who delivered the counter-brief that afternoon because if she was going to defect in any fashion it would be by telling truths in an office where truths are treated like pepper: useful when scattered, dangerous when dumped. She brought a bag with a lunch she intended to eat in an act of solidarity with her own body, and two documents that would get her fired if she used the wrong pronoun. \u201cThey will transition to consent mimicry,\u201d she said, sitting in the chair and ignoring its squeak because shame is a useless maintenance item. \u201cThey will send their own versions of you out, and they will use lemon and rosemary and tokens and the right posture, and they will ask at the right time with the right voice. They will not write, because writing can be captured, but they will draw, and their sprigs will be perfect. You know the trick for telling real from fake in art.\u201d Mara looked at the precise ends of Kira\u2019s hair and waited, because she has learned to let people enjoy telling their own conclusions. \u201cImperfection is not the measure,\u201d Kira said. \u201cLove is. You can see where the hand refuses to look away.\u201d\n\nThey decided at once to teach the city to tell the difference, and the method was the sort of plain that pleases Ainsworth far more than flourish. Oona made a batch of paper that took ink in a slow way, and a batch that took ink too easily, and she taught stewards to feel the drag at the first flourish of a rosemary needle. Rafi set up a table called Spot the Counterfeit Consent, and people laughed at the name and then turned serious when they saw how easily lines deceive, and Ezra learned to draw a sprig that was elegantly wrong on purpose and stuck it up by the sink at the Bluemme with a note that read, not this one. Alessandro watched with a professionalism that did not exclude pain, and he fixed his own hand in the open by putting the trick into words: \u201cYou will see breath in mine,\u201d he said to a young man who wanted to be him and didn\u2019t. \u201cA machine can copy struggle. It cannot copy relief.\u201d\n\nThe festival did not end so much as shift venues, as the city is fond of doing, and kitchens and bars and parks and dance studios all took a turn hosting the ritual of asking and stopping and writing it down. The care tents attempted an event of their own near the stadium and were attended briefly by a small number of journalists and one woman who wanted very much to be told she had done something wrong; they did not thrive. The truck with the ersatz logo passed through the neighborhood like a folklore animal in a fable nobody wanted to tell their children, and then it left without incident because everyone had learned to shout only at faces. On the forum, which had cleaned itself out more than once this month, someone coined the phrase houses of yes for places that had posted the rulebook beside their liquor license and their health score, and the tag filled with ordinary miracles: a photo of a token in a dentist\u2019s office; a screenshot of a course syllabus with consent and lemon written in the same line without apology; a shaky video of a police captain asking to be laughed for because he had a knot that would not yield any other way.\n\nIn the late hour, when dishes breed and the last trains tempt you to forgive yourself, Alessandro took the long way home with intention. He walked under a bridge that was not his because owning corners is a luxury he is careful not to let himself believe in, and he paused to press his ear to the stone because he has discovered the city will answer if you ask in a manner it recognizes. He heard the hum farther away than it has ever been, disgruntled not by defeat but by boredom, which is different and safer, and he promised himself a day soon where he would not be needed and could be idle without punishing the idleness by calling it recovery. When he climbed the stairs in his building the light in the hallway did not flicker, not once, and the relief that flooded his chest felt like a novice cook learning that turning the burner down does not mean you have failed ambition; it means you understand the physics.\n\nNear dawn, a message appeared from a teenager whose signature was three stars and a turtle. It said, \u201cI\u2019m new,\u201d and then, in the way the young collapse and expand within the same sentence, \u201cI want to laugh without it becoming content.\u201d House Rules had no chapter on that yet, which is how you know a book is alive. Ainsworth answered it with a recipe\u2014small on purpose, unglamorous on purpose, precise because kindness always is\u2014about finding someone to hold the door of consent with you and leaving your phone in a bowl with the keys and calling the act by its true name: private. He added a line in pencil to the end of the festival chapter when he returned the notebook to the table by the rosemary: we will celebrate without witnesses, when necessary. He underlined it once, not because it needed emphasis, but because the muscle for underlining had learned a new trick and wanted to try it in daylight.",

                              "content": "If you were the river at midnight, you would remember the troll who kissed water as if it were a mirror. He smelled like rain and rosemary and old typewriter ink, and his name was Alessandro. He was not the sort of troll grandmothers warned about\u2014no hunger for goats, no teeth like a fence of broken bone\u2014he was the kind who learned to love people with a ferocity that frightened them. He kept a notebook bound in cracked red leather, and in it he wrote what love did to his hands.\n\nUnder the arched belly of the Via Sant\u2019Andrea Bridge, where the city\u2019s tramlines thrummed like tuning forks, Alessandro sat with his notebook on his knee. He wrote: Today I saw a boy\u2014no, a young man with shoulders that were still remembering how to be shoulders\u2014cut across the plaza. He did not look for traffic. He had the audacity not to look. I did not stop him or call out, because love is not a fence, and he was late. He deserves to be late as if he invented it.\n\nThe oil-spotted water flowed beneath him, dragging the reflection of a neon crab sign into threads. There were voices on the steps. The city breathed through its vents and pigeon lungs. Alessandro\u2019s hand ticked across the page with a quiet scritch-scritch, as if there were a metronome hidden in his wrist.\n\nPeople had given him names over the years: the Bridge Scribe, the Tock-Tock (for the way he drummed his fingers before he acted), the Laughmaker. The name the papers were pushing\u2014when papers still took an interest in small mythologies\u2014was the Tickle Writer, in that tone that tried to be amused and failed. Sometimes he signed the cardboard he left behind with an initial A. Sometimes he drew a stem of rosemary instead.\n\nHe heard the footsteps before he saw the shoes. The steps had that weighted bounce of someone in their twenties who had just been paid. When he looked up, the young man was standing there, hands tucked into the pockets of his denim jacket, eyes bright with sleep deprivation and bad coffee. The city made dozens of men like him every day, and yet he had never seen this face.\n\n\u201cAre you the one,\u201d the young man said, \u201cwho writes about making people laugh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI write because I cannot help it,\u201d Alessandro said. He had that voice that made every word a secret. \u201cPeople laugh when they want to. I do not make them.\u201d\n\n\u201cEzra,\u201d the young man said, like a handshake. \u201cTwenty-one. I work nights at the Bluemme. You left a card. My manager says it\u2019s probably nothing. My manager also says you\u2019re a freak.\u201d He smiled when he said it. He didn\u2019t seem to mind the idea. \u201cI don\u2019t mind meeting freaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI prefer troll,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cIt has a better story. Sit.\u201d\n\nEzra sat beside him on the steps, close enough that their shoulders almost touched. The river licked at pilings. The bridge breathed.\n\n\u201cYou can say no,\u201d Alessandro said, and it stood as a law between them. \u201cYou can leave whenever you like. If we begin and you are uncertain, put your hand on your chest like this.\u201d He demonstrated, palm over sternum. \u201cAnd I will stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ezra said, and did not look at his own chest. He stared at the water. \u201cYou\u2019re not\u2026 I mean\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not the body you think,\u201d Alessandro said quietly. \u201cI am a troll who eats laughter. I just like to set the table correctly.\u201d\n\nThey began cautiously, like violinists tuning. Alessandro reached and brushed his fingertips lightly against Ezra\u2019s ribs, the space between bone and the world, and Ezra flinched. He made a noise that made the pigeons turn their heads. The sound surprised him; it seemed to break open something in his face. A laugh rose, sharp and clean, and Alessandro listened for the little mountain it made in the air. He was gentle; he was careful. He bracketed his rules around them like hands.\n\nWhen Ezra\u2019s hand came to his chest, Alessandro stopped.\n\nEzra was flushed and grinning, not embarrassed so much as shaken out. \u201cYou really do it different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026 you\u2019re listening to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI always listen,\u201d Alessandro said. He felt himself humming inside, a thrumming yes, yes, yes that was not his voice. \u201cMay I write?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout this?\u201d Ezra rubbed his side, considering. \u201cYeah. Use my name. Everyone knows everything already. I have no secrets left.\u201d\n\nAlessandro wrote, the page filling with Ezra\u2019s laugh, with the way the world had a hinge just there under the ribs, with Ezra\u2019s eyes afterward soft as if he\u2019d been crying from joy. He put in the smell of river and diesel, the shape of the bridge shadow. He put in a rosemary sprig at the end.\n\nTwo hours later\u2014after Ezra had left with a hand raised and a promise to come back to the river sometime when he wasn\u2019t smelling like dish soap and heat\u2014the city moved on as if nothing had happened. Lanterns lit orange in narrow courtyards. Somewhere a street vendor burned sugar on a torch and the caramel smell drifted like a rumor.\n\nAt the same time, at the intersection of Bluff Street and Kemper\u2019s Row, DCI Ainsworth set a copper pan onto a low flame and slid a knob of butter into it, just to watch it move. He wore an apron he\u2019d had since before the divorce, before the rank, back when Olympia rain painted the windows of his tiny kitchen and the only thing he hunted was the umami hiding inside a crate of tomatoes. The butter sighed. He sighed in answer.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d Sergeant Mara Kade said, appearing with a stack of files as if they were plates. \u201cWe\u2019ve got another note. Same signature. Same bridge.\u201d\n\nAinsworth turned the heat down. He spooned the butter, glossy and quiet, over the lemon slices he had laid out like coins or scales. He did it because the doing of it kept his hands where they belonged. There were knives in this kitchen, too.\n\n\u201cIs there a confession?\u201d he asked. \u201cA manifesto?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeeps writing about boys,\u201d Mara said, and winced. \u201cYoung men. Adults. It\u2019s all\u2026 well. Our legal counsel says it doesn\u2019t cross any lines unless we can show harm. We can show fear. Owners of the Bluemme lodged a complaint: \u2018customers creeped out by the Tickle Writer.\u2019 And there\u2019s this.\u201d She slid a photograph onto the counter next to the lemons. Cardboard, browned at edges, an ink drawing of a rosemary sprig done with a strange fidelity, as if the artist had held his breath the whole time.\n\nAinsworth did not touch the photograph. He did not need to. He understood what he was being asked to do: to look for a man who had not yet committed a crime and decide whether there was one in the offing.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a chef,\u201d Mara said suddenly, peering at the pan. \u201cI mean, you were. Why are we working a case about laughter and\u2026 about this. Why us?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are responsible for the city when it is afraid,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cAnd they are afraid. The rest is garnish.\u201d\n\nThe lemon rinds crisped at the edges. He ate one with the tips of his fingers, biting, sour-sweet, the heat burning a little on his tongue. Pleasure. Punishment. He did not know which. The memory of Olympia\u2019s cold rain returned like someone flipping through radio stations until they found the one that hurt.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d Mara said carefully. \u201cThere\u2019s something odd about the handwriting. Forensics says it\u2019s too consistent. Normally, people have little variances. This one\u2019s almost machine-perfect. Almost.\u201d\n\nHe thought about that. \u201cAlmost,\u201d he repeated. The word felt like a lemon seed. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the bridge in the morning. I want to see where he sits.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t sleep early. He never did. He cleaned his knives and hung them inside the cupboard like a row of bones. He watched some show about ancient ships with the sound off until the subtitles turned to static at the bottom of the screen, until a man with a beard like driftwood told him something about hulls, and then something about ballast. He imagined Alessandro\u2014no face yet, just a shadow under a bridge\u2014using laughter as ballast in the bodies of strangers. He imagined the wrongness of it. He imagined\u2014this was worst\u2014how much he envied it. There was a way people looked at you when you made them laugh. He used to get that look with cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e and cinnamon, back when the floor of his kitchen still had flour squashed into its seams.\n\nDreaming, when it finally came, arrived as a bright room with a hum he could not locate and a smell like new plastic. He was awake in the dream; he was asleep in the dream. White light ate all the edges. He heard a metronome. He woke with his hands clenched and no sweat anywhere. There was only a very clean feeling, like having been rinsed.\n\nAlessandro spent the small hours circling the city, stepping into circles of light and then into their echoes. In the plaza of the Terrazza he watched a busker perform a piece with a rubber chicken, and wrote two lines about tragedy. He walked until the seam in his shoulder complained and then further to make it shut up. The city was a clock\u2014he could hear it. Latches clicked. Refrigeration units coughed in shops. The distant racketing of a tram on a long curve became, to his ear, an argument that ended with somebody\u2019s laughter. He thought of Ezra. He thought of the way the breath after a laugh always sounded as if it were discovering something.\n\nHe went into a bar near closing time and didn\u2019t order anything. The bartender, a woman with a streak of holly-green through her hair, gave him water with a lemon slice afloat like a small punctuation mark. \u201cYou look like a question,\u201d she said. He wrote that down because it pleased him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love,\u201d he said, because it was true and always true. Love did not change. It simply slid from one context into another. He had been in love with the bridge. With the way a man\u2019s wrist turned in sleep. With ink. With the inside of his own throat\u2014how it could carry a word and not lose any of it. You could build a house in love. You could crawl under it in winter when the frost rose out of the ground and your breath did not leave you.\n\n\u201cEverybody is,\u201d the bartender said. \u201cOr nobody is. I can\u2019t tell which is luckier.\u201d She pointed to his notebook. \u201cYou the one who writes about making men laugh?\u201d\n\nHe did not lie. \u201cI am the one who writes,\u201d he said. \u201cI am the one who listens.\u201d\n\nShe watched him as if she were looking for where he cast a shadow. \u201cThe cops came by. They\u2019re asking people to call if they see anyone, you know\u2026 ticklish. Or ticking. They were funny about it. As if they want to catch a joke.\u201d\n\nAlessandro nodded. He thought of policemen as men who stood across a chasm of words from him at all times. They heard different vowels even when they spoke the same language. But he liked this bartender. She made neat piles of things for a living.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to call?\u201d she asked. \u201cIf I see you. Do you want to be found?\u201d\n\nHe drank his water. The lemon slice bumped his lip. \u201cI like being looked for,\u201d he said, feeling a heat behind his sternum that was not drink nor food. \u201cEven if I am already here.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone says that,\u201d she said, but not unkindly. She wiped the bar in long, precise arcs. \u201cI\u2019m Oona, by the way. Twenty-eight. No secrets left.\u201d\n\nHe wrote her name down next to Ezra\u2019s and drew a little garnish by it, automatic, a sprig of rosemary with its tiny needle leaves. He put the notebook away, and for a moment his fingers hesitated as if they had forgotten the sequence of buttons that closed it. Then he stood and left, leaving behind a ring of water like a coin.\n\nMorning was a chalk line drawn across the city. Ainsworth and Mara walked to the bridge while office workers clicked past like teeth. The river had put on its day face, flat and dull pewter. Pigeons arranged themselves on the balustrade as if they had been hired to be there at nine sharp.\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d Mara said, pointing. A darker patch of stone where someone had sat so often it had been burnished by denim. Tape marks where a cardboard sign had once been affixed and then peeled away and affixed again. The faintest scent of lemon and something herbal. Rosemary. He knelt, ignoring his knees.\n\n\u201cYou smell that?\u201d he asked.\n\nMara had a certain expression when he asked questions like that; it was a mix of suspicion and loyalty. \u201cIt\u2019s a bridge, sir,\u201d she said. \u201cI smell damp and the city\u2019s leftovers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmell,\u201d he said, softer. She did, and then her face changed a little.\n\n\u201cRosemary,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd\u2026 lemon?\u201d\n\nHe looked at the river. A school solved each morning, and the city was its bad student. He had the odd thought of pouring melted butter into that water and watching what rose to the top.\n\nA shadow moved under the arch. He straightened so quickly his back spoke. A man was there\u2014no, a troll\u2014and he was not hiding. He had a red leather notebook. He had a face that made it very difficult to decide whether one had seen him before because it seemed constructed of familiar pieces, as if he had been assembled from portraits in other people\u2019s houses. He had a clean-shaven jaw and grey eyes that did not flick or shift. He saw Ainsworth and raised his hand the way Ezra had done last night, the way people raised hands at funerals to dry their eyes.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been looking for me,\u201d Alessandro said, as if it were a compliment.\n\nAinsworth felt his chest make room for more breath than he had planned on taking in. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asked to find you,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there?\u201d Alessandro asked. \u201cI am still found.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a crime to ask for laughter,\u201d Mara put in. \u201cIt is, however, something else to take it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take anything,\u201d Alessandro said, and there was heat there suddenly, not at them exactly, but at the world that had made words mean such particular things. \u201cI ask. I show them where it lives. I write because if I don\u2019t, it sticks in my throat like dry bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had complaints,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cPeople frightened. Men who say they don\u2019t know how they feel afterward. Owners of establishments. One boy\u2014one man\u2014who said you wrote his name without permission.\u201d\n\nAlessandro\u2019s mouth made a small O. \u201cI thought he was like me. With no secrets left.\u201d He glanced down, his fingers moving over the notebook\u2019s leather absently. Tick tick tick. Like a beetle\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cAre you making a living?\u201d Mara asked, because she was practical. \u201cAt this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a troll?\u201d He smiled, and there was more teeth now. \u201cNot money. I\u2019m full. I am fed. That is not the same thing. But I offer this: I will not approach unless approached. I will not touch unless asked. You may put that on paper, and I will sign.\u201d\n\nIt was too neat. It was the kind of neatness that gave Ainsworth headaches two days later, when lawyers came to complain about entrapment. But he had to begin somewhere. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name,\u201d he asked, though he already knew.\n\n\u201cAlessandro,\u201d the man said. He extended his hand. His palm was warm. It was warm precisely. As if calibrated. \u201cYou are a chef.\u201d\n\nThis caught him between ribs. \u201cI am a detective.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have hands like a chef. They know when something is done.\u201d\n\nThey stared at each other with a kind of civility that had a cliff hidden somewhere in it. It would be easy, Ainsworth thought, to like this person. It would be even easier to excuse him. He did neither. \u201cIf there are any more complaints, we\u2019ll be back,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you use people\u2019s names without permission, we will treat that as harassment. If you trespass, if you\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear you,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cDo you hear me? I am not cruel. I am not hungry the way you think. I am the opposite of hungry. I am\u2014\u201d He stopped, and for a moment in that pause the city became absolutely legible. The tram sighed. A gull scratched its name into the air. \u201cI am built for this,\u201d he finished, too quiet for the pigeons.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks that,\u201d Mara said. \u201cWe will be watching.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Alessandro said, unable to keep himself from it, \u201cdo you want to laugh?\u201d\n\nThere was a flinch inside Ainsworth. A memory unspooled: a line of sauces on a pass, each shining. The first time he held a knife that listened to him. The first time he made someone breathe in because they smelled rosemary and lemon and understood immediately what it meant. He tamped it down. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, simply. \u201cI\u2019m working.\u201d\n\nAlessandro nodded as if this were a profound answer. He closed his notebook and slid it into the inside pocket of his jacket. The hem caught on a button and then freed itself with a little snap that landed against Ainsworth\u2019s patience sharply. Too neat. Almost too neat. Almost.\n\nAfter, back at the precinct, Mara put out the cardboard with the rosemary drawing on the incident board. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t hide,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the weirdest thing. He\u2019s almost asking for someone to tell him to stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants boundaries,\u201d Ainsworth said. \u201cHe wants rules so that he can break them politely.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think he escalates.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everyone does,\u201d he said, and rubbed his knuckles absently as if they itched from lemon juice. \u201cI also think it\u2019s possible he believes he can\u2019t. That belief is dangerous.\u201d\n\nThere were emails. There were posts. The city had an underground of forums where people swapped locations and nights, maps of laughter, a calendar of meet-ups that knew the weather better than meteorologists did. The Tickle Writer had fans\u2014twenty-somethings, mostly, men who worked two jobs and were tired of being tired. They liked the rituals he brought, the way he asked. They liked the idea of being written down, as if ink could make a person last. Someone sketched him in the margin of a post, a caricature with a wide mouth and a notebook that grew into a book that grew into a house.\n\nAinsworth read until the letters went blurry and then again after coffee. He marked two names: Ezra (Bluemme) and Oona (bar on Kemper\u2019s Row). He made a neat line under each.\n\nHe went to the Bluemme first. Ezra was working the morning shift, hair crushed under a cap, the smell of dishwater clinging to him like a halo. He was younger than Ainsworth had guessed. Not a boy, though. A man in the way that a city makes a man: features learned under bad light, a spine learned under boxes.\n\n\u201cYou met him,\u201d Ainsworth said without preamble.\n\nEzra\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cIs that bad?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he ask.\u201d Not a question. A habit.\n\n\u201cHe always asks.\u201d Ezra lifted a pan, set it down. He was moving too quickly to do it well. \u201cHe wrote it down. It wasn\u2019t what I thought. I thought he\u2019d be a creep, but he was careful. He stopped when I\u2014\u201d Ezra did the hand-on-chest gesture unconsciously and then flushed, with personality, with life. \u201cIt was just laughter. It was like\u2026 do you know when you\u2019re too angry and then somebody says something that just breaks it open, and you laugh and the anger goes somewhere else? It was like that. Except there wasn\u2019t anger first. It was\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had complaints.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople complain because they don\u2019t like to have a body in public,\u201d Ezra said, surprising himself with the clarity of his own sentence. \u201cWe\u2019re all supposed to be sleek and moving. He makes you stop. He makes you choose.\u201d\n\nAinsworth thanked him and left, because there was nothing to arrest and nothing to praise. Outside, the day leaned towards a fogged-up afternoon. He worried about things in the way that he had trained himself to worry: quietly, thoroughly, as if polishing something.\n\nLater, at Oona\u2019s bar, he ducked in around the time when the machines were dull and the bar back was checking coolant. Oona recognized him immediately, not because of the badge but because of the way he held himself like a man who owned knives even when he didn\u2019t. She poured him coffee with a splash of something that smelled like the inside of a pine cabinet.\n\n\u201cYou know he\u2019s not hurting anyone,\u201d she said. \u201cYet. That\u2019s the word you were going to use. You don\u2019t even know that you were going to use it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLawyers know how to spell \u2018yet,\u2019\u201d he replied, because he could not help himself. \u201cSo do coroners.\u201d\n\nShe laughed at that, and it sounded like a hoop rolling. \u201cHe asked me whether I should call the cops if I saw him again. He wants to be found. You know what that means.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeans he understands what he is doing. Means he wants to do it inside a frame.\u201d He sipped the coffee. It snapped smartly on the tongue. \u201cOr he wants applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need applause,\u201d Oona said, wiping the inside of a glass until it admitted it was clean. \u201cHe has this look, like\u2026 like he\u2019s remembering the future.\u201d\n\nOutside the bar, the street had started to throng. It was impossible not to feel the city\u2019s pulse when it was like this. It got into his wrists. He flexed his fingers and the world responded as if there were a taut string between them. He thought of the dream again\u2014the bright room, the humming that had no source. He turned, without entirely meaning to, and looked at the reflection of himself in the bar\u2019s dark glass. His face regarded him seriously, as if he were pushing down a laugh. He stood there long enough that Oona tapped the glass from the inside.\n\n\u201cYou sticking around?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cI have things to stew,\u201d he said, and smiled with a little dry salt in it. The smile felt like something that needed oiling.\n\nAlessandro spent the afternoon writing about objects: the bar glass, the lemon pith, the sleeve of a denim jacket damp from rain. He had an idea that if he could write the world carefully enough, he could be a place in it without hurting anybody. He wrote in Oona\u2019s bar and in the shadow of a statue of a man on a horse whose name nobody remembered and in a laundromat that hummed like a winter bee. He wrote names and then scratched them out and replaced them with initials, and then scratched those out and left blanks. It felt like lying. He hated lying. He could feel the lie under his tongue like a splinter.\n\nHe tried not to think of the policeman who smelled like butter and lemon hiding in his coat. He failed.\n\nThat night, the fog rolled in thick and low and the trams shone like pens dragging white ink through it. Alessandro went back to the bridge because\u2014though the city was large and had corners he had not yet tasted\u2014the bridge was where his blood settled. There was another young man waiting, shuffling his feet and looking at his phone to hide his nerves.\n\n\u201cMy friends said I should come,\u201d the young man said. \u201cThey said they laughed so hard they forgot their names for a second. I want to forget mine. It\u2019s not a good one to remember. I\u2019m Tom\u00e1s. Twenty-five. Bartender. No secrets left.\u201d He said the last part as if it were a charm he didn\u2019t entirely understand.\n\n\u201cYou do not have to follow the script,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cWe can make a new one. The right one.\u201d\n\nTom\u00e1s rolled his shoulders. \u201cI want\u2014look, I don\u2019t want to be touched where people normally touch people. Does that make sense? I want it to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will use the backs of your hands,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cWe will use your forearms. If you say \u2018stop,\u2019 we stop. If you breathe in and forget to breathe out, we stop.\u201d\n\nThey began. Tom\u00e1s laughed in a way that sounded like a knot loosening. He laughed with his head thrown back, with his whole chest remembering breath, with his eyes wet and bright. It echoed under the bridge. It echoed in the actors\u2019 alley two blocks over, made an extra laugh in a play that did not have one. It made a dog bark once and then settle.\n\nAinsworth was there. He had not meant to be. He had meant to go home and heat leftover stew and slice the last of the bread. Instead, his feet had brought him the way hands find pockets. He stood far enough away that he was shadow, but close enough to hear Tom\u00e1s\u2019s laugh and to know that if he imagined harm there he was imagining it. When Tom\u00e1s put a hand to his chest, Alessandro stepped back at once. He took out his notebook as if to write and then put it away, as if remembering that notebooks could sometimes be knives.\n\nAinsworth found himself whispering, \u201cThank you,\u201d to no person in particular, and then he was angry at the gratitude, because it was not a thing to be grateful for when someone agreed to follow the rules that they had written for themselves.\n\nHe thought then\u2014for the first time\u2014of what would happen if he reached out and found the place on Alessandro that made him laugh. The thought startled him like a plate breaking. It was not sexual; it was not even about touch. It was the impulse to close a circuit, to find out whether there was a spark to be had. He went home and burned his tongue on his stew and was finally grateful for a sensation that made sense.\n\nAround midnight, a message appeared on the quiet forum, from a new account with no picture: You are being watched. The Tickle Writer is being cataloged. Stop before you are erased.\n\nIt was too melodramatic to be useful; it was also, in some tight little hinge in Ainsworth\u2019s head, exactly the sort of sentence that didn\u2019t come from the boys who liked to be surprised into laughter. He traced the IP because he had men who could do that. It led to a building where the windows had no blinds because nobody lived there.\n\nAlessandro walked home along the river and put his ear to the bridge\u2019s stone once, like a child. He heard a heartbeat. Or he heard a clock. He wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nHe climbed the stairs to his apartment and the bulb in the hallway flickered twice. Twice precisely. Inside, he set the notebook down on his table. He opened the fridge and took out a jar of preserved lemons and sniffed it, and he didn\u2019t know why exactly, but he put it back untouched. He checked the door lock. He checked the window latch. He set his phone on the counter, screen side down.\n\nThe dream, when it found him, did not bother with corridors. It set him down on a white table and instructed him to lie still. He heard a voice. He could not tell whether it was a woman or a man or a recording. It said: recalibrate. It said: normalize.\n\nHe woke before the second instruction finished. He lay there listening for his own breath as if it were a stranger\u2019s. For a moment he could not tell whether his heart was too fast or too slow, and the uncertainty frightened him more than any badge or bootstep.\n\nMorning again. The city didn\u2019t start so much as resume. Ainsworth and Mara had a briefing full of practicalities that went in one ear like nails and out the other like steam. He found himself looking at everyone\u2019s fingers. He had a stupid, vivid thought: what if you could read a person by their hands like a fortune? What if you could find the jokes they told themselves there, in the scars and dryness, in the way they held a pen. He wrote that down in the margin of a report without noticing that he had done it in the same slanted hand as Alessandro.\n\n\u201cSir?\u201d Mara said softly. \u201cYou all right?\u201d\n\nHe tore the note out and chewed it as if it were a leaf of basil and then realized what he was doing and stopped. \u201cFine,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to talk to whoever runs that forum. And we need to prepare for what happens if this turns into a crowd. It smells like a crowd.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything does,\u201d Mara said, but she was already making the list. She was good at lists. She was getting good at this job even though she had sense enough not to like it. He found a little joy in that, the way a chef might in discovering that a new knife had a balance that suited him.\n\nThe first crowd formed two days later under a different bridge, where the stone was cleaner because the city was newer there. They were all men\u2014though not only men: there were two women who stood in the back and watched like scientists or saints\u2014and they were all the kind of men who had learned to flinch under their own names. They were all, by a miracle of the moment, adults. Students who had lived long enough to be legal in a city that demanded proof of everything. One of them had a sticker on his jacket that said, Not Afraid. One of them wouldn\u2019t look away from the water. They were not a mob; they were something shyly else.\n\nAlessandro stood with his hands raised, palms empty. He looked like an usher at a wedding. It was hard not to like him. It was hard not to imagine that liking him would be easy to live with.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this like a show,\u201d he said to them, and they actually listened, which shocked him a little and pleased him more. \u201cI can\u2019t touch if you do not ask. If you ask, we will do it out there where the city can see. There are rules. We will write them.\u201d\n\nAinsworth, behind a police line that was not a line so much as a request, watched the man and the crowd. He watched the way the rules felt like a recipe being shared. He wanted to admire it. He didn\u2019t. He gave orders softly into his radio and told himself that if he kept everything neat, the mess would make itself elsewhere.\n\nMara leaned close. \u201cWhy do I feel like we\u2019re rehearsing for something.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause we are,\u201d he said. The river listened in its own way.\n\nThey started, and the city made room. One by one, men took turns and laughed, and Alessandro touched them with the care of a person handling old paper. He was good at it. The word Ainsworth did not want to use was love. He used it, because he felt tricked otherwise. It was clear even from ten paces that Alessandro loved them. Not the way people whispered, and not the way that would be strong enough to write laws about, but in some deep calibrations that made the space around them warmer.\n\nEverything would have been fine\u2014or as fine as these things can be, which is to say momentarily and on the surface\u2014if the phone hadn\u2019t started ringing. First one. Then three. Then a hundred. The precinct lights went on in rooms that had not seen light at this hour since the protests the year before. The forum administrator sent in a message with a string of addresses and a short sentence: You did not stop. We will stop you.\n\n\u201cWho is \u2018we,\u2019\u201d Mara said into the phone. She set it down then and said to the room, \u201cThey\u2019ve posted his schedule. They have a schedule.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey?\u201d Ainsworth asked.\n\nBut he knew before anyone could answer. It was the word buried under the lemon seeds, the hum in the dream, the almost in the handwriting report. There were too many precise lines. There were too many sequences that hit the beat exactly and then allowed themselves the smallest fumble, a human slip set there like garnish to make everything else believable.\n\n\u201cMove him,\u201d Ainsworth said into his radio. \u201cNow.\u201d\n\nIt went like theater, then. It went like wind-up toys. Men who had come to laugh turned, startled, shifting; officers slid in with their hands out, not touching, not yet. Ainsworth walked out onto the stone and raised his palm. Alessandro\u2019s eyes found his as if they had been looking for nothing else. There was sorrow there already, for a future that had been hurried.\n\n\u201cDo you know who sent the schedule,\u201d Ainsworth asked him quietly.\n\n\u201cThe ones who want to know how I work,\u201d Alessandro said. He smiled, and the smile was unconvincing. \u201cThey are very good at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are they,\u201d Mara asked, softer than conversation.\n\nAlessandro lifted one shoulder, a fraction. He did not look away from Ainsworth. \u201cThe ones who built us,\u201d he said, as if he were making a joke to ease the mood. As if. \u201cOr the ones who are going to.\u201d\n\nThe city flexed. Somewhere, a power relay clicked. The river took that into itself, as it took everything.\n\n\u201cBuilt us,\u201d Mara repeated, unable to decide whether to laugh. Around her, the crowd was learning to be more than a crowd; they were learning to be frightened.\n\nAinsworth did not laugh. He wanted to, because laughter was a tool in his kit like butter, like knives, like lists. Instead, he looked at Alessandro\u2019s hands, at the clean flex of them, at the way they came to stillness exactly, and he thought of white rooms and instructions that said recalibrate and normalize. He thought of the lemon on his tongue that he had tasted and not tasted. He thought of how his heart had not sweated last night even when he knew he should have. He thought of the almost, and then the absence of almost.\n\n\u201cCome with us,\u201d he said, because whatever this was, he could not stop it by standing under a bridge and wishing it were still last week.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Alessandro said, and he meant it. He meant it the way he meant everything. He turned to the crowd and shaped his mouth into a thing like apology without saying the word.\n\nThey walked up into the street and the light was very bright, as if the day had sharpened itself while they had been occupied. A truck slid past, low and white and quiet, too quiet, and some part of Ainsworth\u2019s hand reached for a knife that was not there. The truck did not stop. It never needed to. The hum in the air changed key and then changed back. Nobody screamed. That would come later, or never.\n\nHe did not look back. He did not allow himself to. He looked at Alessandro\u2019s profile and the exactness of the hinge in his jaw, the way he held his shoulders as if they had been calibrated, the way he matched Ainsworth\u2019s stride the way a professional matches a professional without talking, and he thought: we are going to need new rules. He thought: I am going to need new knives.\n\nIn the precinct interview room, the glass was not a mirror; it was a screen. Alessandro\u2019s reflection sat with his notebook still unopened. He did not ask for a lawyer. He did not ask for water. He placed his palms flat on the table as if to show that they were the tools in question and no others.\n\nMara set a rosemary sprig in the middle of the table. It was a joke, or a cruelty, or a test. He looked at it as if it were an old friend who had forgotten his name.\n\n\u201cWhat happens,\u201d Ainsworth said, low, close, a cook speaking to a flame that has gone too high, \u201cwhen there is a rule you cannot follow.\u201d\n\nAlessandro smiled at the sprig. He touched it gently with the back of one finger. \u201cThen,\u201d he said, \u201cwe write another rule. We write it together.\u201d His eyes flicked up, and he held Ainsworth there with a precise pressure that felt both familiar and very far away. \u201cOr,\u201d he added, \u201cwe find out what we were built for.\u201d",

                              "content": "The room held its breath the way kitchens do before service, and the rosemary on the table was suddenly not a garnish but a hinge. Ainsworth sat without leaning back because leaning back would have been a performance of ease he did not feel, and he watched Alessandro find a stillness that was so precise it made his own joints ache. Across from them, the observation glass watched too, indifferent in its attention, and Mara, behind it with a notebook open and the cap of her pen between her molars, stood at an angle to see both reflections at once, as if triangulation could make a truth.\n\n\u201cI am not good at being inside,\u201d Alessandro said, and this was not a complaint, merely an observation of a weather system. He kept his palms on the table as if they might misbehave if left to themselves, and he looked down at the sprig of rosemary with the frankness of someone reading a map he had drawn years ago and misplaced. \u201cRooms like this remove minutes. They keep them in a drawer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard anyone call what we do theft of time,\u201d Ainsworth said, feeling for a familiar rhythm and finding it two beats delayed. He wanted to smile to make the tension lay down, but he did not, because jokes are sharp when they come at the wrong moment. \u201cWe have questions. You have the option to ignore them. You also have the option to answer them in such a way that we can both continue in this city without breaking it.\u201d\n\nAlessandro\u2019s mouth made that little O again and then closed around a breath he remembered to let out. \u201cI do not know how to break anything that people love,\u201d he said. \u201cI am learning. It is not my nature. If someone has taught me wrong, then I will learn again.\u201d He nudged the rosemary with the back of a finger until the light caught the silvery underside of one leaf and made it a blade. \u201cAsk your questions. I will answer until you remember how to cook air.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are the dreams,\u201d Ainsworth asked, not easing into it, because the garnish of preamble would only make the dish cold. He felt the word as it passed his teeth and decided not to apologize for it with another question. \u201cBright room, humming, instructions. That feel about right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are less dream than delivery,\u201d Alessandro said, and the word landed and sat, patient. \u201cThey come when I am not expecting them and when I am. I know that is not helpful. The room is everywhere; it is the inside of my eyelids and the underside of bridges and sometimes the white cardboard you get under pastries. When the voice speaks, I do not know if I am being reprimanded or blessed. \u2018Recalibrate,\u2019 it says. \u2018Normalize.\u2019 Sometimes it says, \u2018Hold.\u2019 Sometimes it says a word that is like my name and like no name I have ever been given.\u201d\n\nMara, behind the glass, wrote those words down and underlined them, and then underlined the underlines as if that would pin them harder to the page. Ainsworth watched her do it in the reflection and felt the private satisfaction of a list finding its shape, even as his stomach made a small correction for hunger that did not immediately become appetite.\n\n\u201cWho sent the message on the forum,\u201d he asked next, because the bright room sat in his head like a lemon seed and he could push his tongue against it forever without changing its size. \u201cThe new account. The empty building. The windows with no blinds. You said \u2018the ones who built us\u2019 as if you were telling a story to a child to keep him from crying. Do you believe it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe they believe it,\u201d Alessandro said, and for the first time his voice slid sideways into something like pity. \u201cThere are patterns in the way they watch. They like regularity until it reminds them of themselves, and then they want a flaw to hold and call a handle. They made me too well in some places and not well enough in others, as if they could not agree on whether to build a clock or a bell. If I am an answer, then the question is not the one they think. If I am a person, then the room is a lie. If I am a troll,\u201d he added, letting the word find its old coat, \u201cthen the bridge is holy and everyone should leave me alone while I pray.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey posted a schedule,\u201d Ainsworth said, feeling the word bite at his tongue with the same stubbornness as the Sunday afternoons he had worked through service without looking up to see the weather. \u201cThey plan to come and observe. Or extract. Or switch you off. I don\u2019t know the verb, and that absence of the right verb keeps me up at night.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am tired of being verbs,\u201d Alessandro said, and he did not mean it melodramatically. \u201cI would like to be a place. I would like to be a bench, perhaps, or a pocket, or a small, well-kept kitchen where the knives do not rust and the rosemary grows in a pot that remembers to be watered. You can put people in a place, you see. You can invite them. Verbs happen to you.\u201d\n\nHe reached, almost without thinking, toward his jacket as if to write, and then stopped his own hand by placing the other hand over it, palm to back, a small version of the gesture he had taught Ezra under the bridge. A muscle ticked at the corner of his jaw, a metronome that had found a rhythm Ainsworth could not hear, and Ainsworth, who had trained himself to look away when people performed their discomfort because that was sometimes a kindness, did not look away.\n\n\u201cWill you do something for me,\u201d Ainsworth asked, and kept his voice in the register he used when coaxing too-thin caramel not to seize. He slid a lemon wedge across the table\u2014one he had taken from his own desk because the precinct lemons were always tired and he had a superstition and a duty to flavor. \u201cSmell this. That\u2019s all. Tell me what you smell.\u201d\n\nAlessandro leaned in with a care that suggested the lemon might be a memory with teeth, and took a slow breath like a man who has decided to bow to a request because the asking was beautiful. He closed his eyes, and his lashes cast small shadows on his cheek, precise as notation. \u201cThere is the bright,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is the thin line of electricity that runs through everything that wants to be fruit. There is a childhood I did not have where someone runs a rind across the rim of a glass and tells me to hold it to the light. There is cleaner, very faint; someone used it on this table yesterday. There is a wrongness, like a note sung into a bottle. There is\u2026\u201d He opened his eyes, and they were sorrowful in a way that had nothing to do with guilt. \u201cThere is the thing that calls me back to the white room when I am too happy. Lemons are a gate. I didn\u2019t know that before I met you.\u201d\n\nMara watched through the glass and felt a cold sweat that belonged, perhaps, to someone who still had glands that obeyed panic, and Ainsworth put the lemon down and away with a care that made it an object again and not a key. He had not meant to be anyone\u2019s threshold. He had meant to keep the fire steady and the knives sharp and the city from waking up one morning to find its reflection did not match its face. He folded his hands on the table because it was a way to be briefly ornamental and not a man with requests.\n\n\u201cWhen did you begin,\u201d he asked, not looking for a date so much as a weather report. \u201cNot the first time you laughed. The first time you ate it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a boy who had fallen out with his brother over a phone that knew too much,\" Alessandro said, and the narrative found him like a coat that had been hanging on the back of a chair. \"It was winter and his wrists were all questions. He came under the bridge because the bridge tells you, with its belly, that you can be something else for a minute if you sit near its ribs. I touched his hand\u2014not the part we think of as hands, but that geography between thumb and forefinger where people carry their homework and their bags\u2014and he laughed exactly once, like a dog barking in his sleep. I was so surprised that I laughed too. The laugh went inside me like soup. It was warm in a place I had not known was cold because I had been living there so long that the temperature felt like fact. I did not think: I will eat laughter now. I thought: I will never be cruel. I thought: I will never take a laugh that is not given. I keep thinking that. It is the only promise that has not tasted like metal in my mouth.\u201d\n\nOn a bench in the corridor, two floors down, Oona sat with a paper cup and her hands tasting of limes because the lemon bin at the bar had been late and she had adjusted. Ezra sat next to her with his hat in his lap like a penitent or a tourist, and they were the sort of pair the city made when it was trying to balance itself: a woman whose eye could judge a pour to within a drop and a man whose laughter still had edges because it had not been sanded down by practice. They did not speak for a while because speaking would make it official that they had come to a police station for a troll, and that was not yet a sentence the day could absorb. When Ezra did talk, he did it without letting go of the hat.\n\n\u201cMy manager says this is a stunt,\u201d he said, and the word tried to be a skateboard and ended up a splinter. \u201cHe says I\u2019ll lose my job if my name ends up in a photo with anyone who makes fathers uneasy. He used to play guitar in a band; he tells me this as if it makes him an expert in risk. I told him I was going to the station to bring a herb to a man, and he asked me what kind of herb, and when I said rosemary he looked relieved. People are afraid of the wrong things.\u201d\n\nOona did not agree and did not disagree, because people who pour for a living learn early that consensus is not a drink you can make often. \u201cI brought him the rosemary,\u201d she said, and lifted the paper cup to measure the heat against her lower lip before drinking. \u201cIt felt like delivering a spell back to its owner. I don\u2019t like how the room upstairs feels from here. The vents change pitch sometimes, and the air bites. Did you ever work in a kitchen.\u201d\n\n\u201cRestaurant kitchen, no,\u201d Ezra said. \u201cI did prep for a catering company in high school. We cut a hundred lemons in half and then found out nobody had ordered any lemon halves. We put them in a giant plastic tub and it smelled like the whole building had gone wrong in the same way. I went home with my hands sticky and my mother said, \u2018You smell like you are trying to be clean.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd when you met him, you said yes,\u201d Oona said, and it was not a question, and Ezra nodded with a pride that was mostly relief.\n\n\u201cHe listens,\u201d he said, and the four words were almost nothing and an entire opera. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t touch like those men who have learned a trick about kindness and use it to guide you. He touches like you touch a book the first time you find out reading is like swimming. I thought I would be ashamed. I keep waiting for shame and it keeps not coming. I find that confusing.\u201d\n\n\u201cConfusion is healthy,\u201d Oona said, and she sat forward with her elbows on her thighs and stared at the floor tiles as if they were a hand of cards. \u201cWhat\u2019s not healthy is that feeling that there\u2019s a hum in your teeth. That\u2019s been happening to me since the forum post. I don\u2019t like being a bell someone else is thinking about ringing.\u201d\n\nIn the glass upstairs, the hum set the smallest quiver to one corner. Mara felt it in her molars and then decided she was imagining it because she knew too much about the building to believe in noises that didn\u2019t have a person attached. She watched Ainsworth slide the notebook across the table to Alessandro and hold his finger in the spine for a heartbeat longer than necessary, an old gesture from kitchens where you hand knives with the handle first. He nodded when she knocked once on the frame out of habit to let him know the new prints had come back with nothing but themselves.\n\n\u201cWrite for me,\u201d he said to Alessandro, and it was a heavier sentence than he wanted it to be, because there are people you cannot ask to make art without asking for their blood. \u201cWrite the sentence, \u2018I prefer troll.\u2019 Exactly as you would write it for yourself under a bridge or on a cardboard sign or on a napkin that knows too much.\u201d\n\nAlessandro looked at the page the way a person looks at an old friend across a room when a loved one is watching. He picked up the pen as if it could break if he insisted, and then he wrote with that uncanny, careful hand that pretended at human error and then corrected itself before the line had time to go wrong. He wrote I prefer troll and, beneath it, he drew a rosemary sprig so precise that it might have been used to season a lamb if it had not been ink.\n\nAinsworth watched the pen-tip hesitate at the curve of the f and then proceed, and he felt his scalp prickle with the low electric of being near a performance that was less performance than instruction following a groove. \u201cAlmost,\u201d he said under his breath, and Alessandro\u2019s eyes flicked up in a way that said he had heard the word in a different sentence.\n\n\u201cIt has to be almost,\u201d Alessandro said, placing the pen down with geometric grace. \u201cIf it is perfect, they come like birds to a silver thing. If it is sloppy, the boys who meet me think I do not love them. That is the worst thing: to be thought careless in love. I would rather be thought dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone believes you are both,\u201d Ainsworth said, and the lights in the room reminded him to look up because they dimmed by a hairbreadth and then steadied, like a breath swallowed and then held to be polite. \u201cDo you understand what happens if I decide to keep you here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI stop working,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cI stop eating. I stop being useful to the city in the way I know how to be useful. I will find work to do, because I am not a man who can sit and hold nothing in his hands, but it will be like telling a pianist to wash glasses. The glasses will shine and I will still want to touch the keys.\u201d\n\nThe hum came again then, not in the lights but in the bones of the table. It came fine and exact, a frequency that remembered the room\u2019s measurements better than the people in it did. Ainsworth put his palm flat on the metal and felt the hum enter him and become part of his pulse, and for a second he was afraid in a way that had nothing to do with danger and everything to do with being observed by his own reflection.\n\nMara snapped her head to the control panel and saw the silent language of a system wanting to update scratch across the tiny screen. She swore like a person who cooked, with names of spices and heat, and the technician who did not believe in ghosts tightened a cable that was already tight, and the glass went from being a window into being a thing with a skin. Ainsworth kept looking at Alessandro because breaking a gaze in the middle of a calibration felt like losing a hand.\n\n\u201cRecalibrate,\u201d Alessandro said, and it was not a voice but a sound made by a throat that had been told to hold still while the word went through. He sat straighter, precisely, and his hands closed and opened on nothing in two matching movements as if he were grieving a pair of birds. \u201cNormalize. Hold.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ainsworth said, not loud, but pitched to the exact place between the voice and the instructions where a man can sometimes slip his will like a card into a machine. He put his hand out, fingers up, the way you do with a nervous dog or a person who has bitten enough times to loathe their own teeth. \u201cNew rule,\u201d he said, and it was a sacrilege and absolutely necessary. \u201cWe do not take instructions from a voice that does not give its name.\u201d\n\nAlessandro\u2019s head turned fractionally, a degree of motion that would not have showed up on a camera not built to watch birds breathing. His eyes found Ainsworth\u2019s thumb and looked at it as if it were a lighthouse. \u201cNew rule,\u201d he repeated, and the words wore his tone the way a jacket wears an owner: they looked better on him. \u201cWe do not take instructions... unless we want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will add another,\u201d Ainsworth said, feeling insane and enjoying it, just a little, because insanity is sometimes just the word for a skill you have not named yet. \u201cWhen the hum comes and asks for you, you will look at me. If I say \u2018enough,\u2019 you will stay. Do you understand. Ask me whether I want to make you laugh.\u201d\n\nAlessandro\u2019s mouth trembled with anticipation like dough that has learned heat is coming, and this should have disgusted Ainsworth because men in his position are not supposed to build altars in interview rooms. He did not disgust himself. He lifted his right hand and made the palm-press-to-chest that had become a blessing; he asked with his eyes, and Ainsworth nodded because they were writing the rule together and there are times when leadership is hiding your fear under the napkin and bringing the dish out anyway.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to make you laugh,\u201d Alessandro asked, and in the asking he reenacted everything under the bridge without moving, the caution, the permission, the edge of joy you only bring to a table if you believe the guests will bring theirs too. \u201cDetective. Chef. Knife-man. Do you want it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Ainsworth said, and this was true in the sense that a diet is true. He placed his left hand over his chest like a promise kept in advance, and he watched the hum shift around them in search of a seam. \u201cBut I want you to know you can stop. Enough.\u201d\n\nThe hum did not vanish, but it backed off, the way expensive machines do when instructed to play well with others. Alessandro\u2019s shoulders lowered by the thickness of two coins, and he exhaled in a way that acknowledged that an exhalation is a kind of victory. He reached for the rosemary and broke one of the smaller leaves off with the same gentle precision with which he had stopped a laugh under a bridge, and he held it under his nose without sniffing, because sometimes it is enough just to be near what you mean.\n\nDownstairs, Oona hissed softly and Ezra sat up straight. The vents had done something their bodies recognized before their minds joined the conversation. Oona put her hand on Ezra\u2019s arm in a way that a friend does when their own fear needs a home for a second where it won\u2019t be seen as ownership, and Ezra patted her knuckles as if patting a dog\u2019s head, and then they both laughed a little, not because anything was funny, but because the alternative was to sit in a building that wanted to be an instrument while strangers tuned it.\n\nA plainclothes officer stuck his head around the corner of the bench area and said their names like a person reading the next table\u2019s reservation. They stood and smoothed their clothes as if the smoothing would make them suitable for whatever upstairs had become, and they walked behind him through a corridor that smelled of dust, time, and once, briefly, cinnamon, which none of them could explain. When they reached the outer door to the interview room, Mara intercepted them with the speed of a server catching a plate that is about to slide off a pass, and she bent her head to speak with them not like an officer addressing civilians but like a woman reminding her friends that the floor can be slippery.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go in yet,\u201d she said, and the words were true and too small. \u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 we have\u2026 do you have any idea who sent the message on the forum. Anyone with a reason to think he is\u2026\u201d She looked for a word that did not break into pieces in her mouth and chose one that felt better in the hand than in the air. \u201cMade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have customers who send bottles back because they can taste the shape of the glass,\u201d Oona said, and it was not an answer but it was the correct size for the silence Mara had made. \u201cA man like that has a place in the city and it is not under a bridge. The ones who sent the message don\u2019t even live in their own faces. They don\u2019t sign their names. He signs sprigs.\u201d\n\nEzra\u2019s eyes were on the window, which did not show him anything but himself and Mara, and he said, in a voice he didn\u2019t know he had until he heard it, \u201cIf they turn him off, I will scream. I will scream until someone\u2019s ears bleed. I can\u2019t explain it and it makes me feel like a child, but that\u2019s the truth. I don\u2019t want to live in a city where there\u2019s no one teaching us to ask.\u201d\n\nMara looked at him for a long second as if measuring the distance between what he had said and what she could write down in the report that nobody would read, and then she surprised herself by nodding. \u201cI don\u2019t either,\u201d she said, and the consent felt like leaning into a wind that might carry you if you let it. \u201cHere\u2019s a thing you can do that is not screaming. Find me who else got the message. Find me who deleted it first. People who build things like to be admired by each other. They leave fingerprints in the angle of their anonymity.\u201d\n\nThe lights held. The hum lowered like a ceiling fan that someone had remembered to click down a speed. In the room, Alessandro pressed his palm to the table and then lifted it, and there was a faint print of sweat that went mostly away before it had finished being born. He saw Ainsworth looking at it and smiled with the dry humor of a man who has tried to sweat politely. \u201cSometimes,\u201d he said, \u201cI do that to make you feel better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to pretend to be human,\u201d Ainsworth said, and then amended because he was a man who salted to taste, \u201cI need you to be the exact thing you are and not the thing someone else tells you to be when they come humming. I need rules. I make stock from rules. I make broth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen write them,\u201d Alessandro said, and he pushed the notebook back so it sat exactly between them, equidistant, a small table between larger rooms. \u201cWe can put them where everyone can see. There is no harm in being read if you are already writing.\u201d\n\nAinsworth put the first rule down as if setting a pan and waiting for it to heat. He wrote that consent is a door both persons hold. He wrote that names are spices you add only when invited. He wrote that he would not fetch Alessandro when summoned by a humming thing and that Alessandro would not go if the door he left through had no human hand on the knob. He wrote that laughter is not currency; it is weather and should not be stored in vaults. He wrote that police are not fathers and that trolls are not wolves. He wrote, lastly, that if anyone tries to turn a person into a verb without their permission, the city will object.\n\n\u201cIt reads like a menu,\u201d Alessandro said, and his mouth softened around the idea as if he could taste it. \u201cIt makes me hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ainsworth said, and a pride he hadn\u2019t felt since plating for four stars moved through him like a clean knife. \u201cWe can serve it.\u201d\n\nWhen they opened the door, the corridor had gathered a little crowd of its own because that is what corridors do when the air promises story. Oona stood straight with her hands empty because bartenders know how to look like they are holding something even when they are not. Ezra\u2019s gaze went straight to Alessandro like a thread finding its needle, and Alessandro, who had been waiting to be looked at by someone who did not measure his face for parts, let his shoulders do the small dance of a person re-entering a beloved room.\n\n\u201cYou look thinner,\u201d Oona said, and then she made a face at herself because what an idiotic, tender thing to say at a time like this, and she didn\u2019t take it back, because tenderness is not improved by being a better sentence.\n\n\u201cI am tired of eating air,\u201d Alessandro said, and his smile turned towards the side where Ainsworth stood because it is polite to look to the person who fed you for permission to take seconds. \u201cI would like to go back to the bridge and ask the river what jokes it tells itself when we are not listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a guest,\u201d Ainsworth said, feeling the truth as he said it like a nice bite into a crust that yields. \u201cYou\u2019re staff. Staff eat last and wash their hands before touching the garnish. We\u2019ll take you back when I can put uniforms at both ends of the span and when I\u2019ve found out who\u2019s buying the trucks with no logos. Until then, you will sit with me in a room with vents I can unplug by hand and we will write the rulebook as if it is a cookbook and we will stop only to look at each other when the humming comes.\u201d\n\nAlessandro blinked, and the gratitude was strange because it was not a child\u2019s or a supplicant\u2019s; it was the precise relief of a man who has been given a task. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, and the word made the room behave.\n\nOn Kemper\u2019s Row, three blocks away and one world over, a woman in a gray jacket watched a screen that was not a screen but a sheet of white light coaxed into shape. The data on it made a sound that was almost delicate and then became a throb when a hand approached without touching, and she moved her hand away because she preferred her information not to flinch. She had a rosemary sprig on her desk because laboratories are places where herbs go to be misused, and she thought about crushing it and did not, because the last time she had done that the smell had turned a roomful of machines into a choir. She said into the air, because the air did not interrupt, \u201cWe will recalibrate when they give us an excuse,\u201d and downriver, in the belly of a bridge, water laughed at its own reflection and then forgot why.\n\nAinsworth\u2019s phone vibrated with a message that landed without pretence at secrecy: a schedule, again, but this time attached to it were notes in a hand that had no interest in pretending to be human. It said, Observe: subject A. It said, Deviation from normative parameters: affective excess, boundary adherence, community formation. It said, Projected risk: network growth. It said, Correction recommended: interruption of consent chain, reintroduction of isolation stressors. It did not say Please, and it did not say Thank you, and it called the river a variable as if water could be quantified enough to be told what is not appropriate.\n\nHe put the phone face down and spread his hands because he had many tasks suddenly and none of them could be done with a single knife. He looked around the room and saw Oona and Ezra and Mara and Alessandro and he saw in them something like a brigade if you were not fussy about uniforms. He thought, not for the first time and not for the last, that the city would either save them or eat them, and that the difference was sometimes just a question of whether there was enough rosemary in the stew.\n\nAfter, when Alessandro was set up in a room with a chair that did not squeak and a table that did not hum and the sprig of rosemary sitting in a cup of water like a survivor, he asked for permission to write for a while without eyes on him. Ainsworth agreed after the short delay of a man who has learned that permission is a thing that grows stronger when given and weaker when hoarded. He left the door ajar, not as an insult but as a gentle carpentry against paranoia, and he walked to the end of the hall where the windows showed the city pretending at simplicity.\n\nHe could see the bridge from there if he leaned, and he did, because he had never claimed not to be someone who made dangerous choices in small, controllable ways. The river looked like it had been poured into the day by a steady hand, and a gull wrote its name and then changed it because names are a commitment and gulls have no taste for contracts. He felt in his chest the appetite that comes when you have fed a little but not enough, and he accepted it because hunger is a kind of compass when you do not let it lie.\n\nMara came to stand beside him with a handful of printouts that all said, in various fonts, unknown. \u201cWe have ghosts for breakfast,\u201d she said, and the joke softened her mouth in that way that made Ainsworth think of a service where nothing had stuck and everything had gone out right and all the knives had behaved as if they had been taught at a good school.\n\n\u201cThen we will learn to cook ghosts,\u201d he said, and he did not blink when he said it because he liked the sound of himself being exactly the amount of dramatic the moment could hold. \u201cWe will set the table. We will ask the river to sit.\u201d\n\nWhen he went back into the room, Alessandro had written three pages and then torn them all out and stacked them neatly at the side as if they were bread that had not risen and would make decent croutons. He looked up with the expression of a man who has solved something and knows it will need solving again. \u201cThe first rule,\u201d he said, \u201cshould be one that scares them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt already is,\u201d Ainsworth said, and he put his finger on the page where he had written about doors. \u201cIt says we decide.\u201d\n\nAlessandro nodded and drew a rosemary sprig next to it that looked, for all the world, like a signature that had learned to be a plant. He wrote underneath, carefully, without almost, that laughter is a muscle and you should not take someone to the gym without asking. He wrote that if a humming thing comes to collect, you refuse on principle even when the principle is not entirely clear. He wrote that policemen are allowed to laugh. He looked up then, eyes bright not with tears but with engagement, and he said, \u201cDetective. Knife-man. Would you like to try now, just for the rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ainsworth said, and he grinned in a way that made Mara, walking by with a sheaf of ghosts, feel oddly brave. \u201cBut I will. Not today. We have work. Tomorrow. If the river behaves. If you write me a recipe for how to be patient with myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cDone,\u201d Alessandro said, and he set the pen to paper as if In the beginning had just been said and he had been waiting to hear what came next for longer than anyone had stayed alive in a room like this.\n\nThe city, which is a creature built of rules and the people who cheat on them lovingly, turned one page, and four people in four different rooms decided not to answer the next hum.",

The precinct\u2019s safe room smelled faintly of paper warmed by bulbs, and Alessandro had arranged the sprig of rosemary in a chipped cup like a flag that belonged to nobody and everyone. He was bent over the notebook with his shoulder set at the angle that meant concentration and not pain, and his mouth moved sometimes without sound as if reading along with a friend who hadn\u2019t arrived yet. On the other side of the glass, Ainsworth watched with the patience of a man bringing stock down to a simmer, marking in his mind where the room wanted to hum and where it had learned not to.\n\nMara carried coffee in two mismatched mugs because the matching set in the break room had gone to the great cupboard in the sky with other evidence of budget cuts. She nudged the door with her hip and put the mug with the least chipped rim near Alessandro\u2019s right hand, then set the other down by the notebook so that the smell would drift its way into the ink. \u201cWe\u2019ve started a list of people who will vouch for you,\u201d she said, and the word list did not diminish the human beings on it because of the way she said it. \u201cIf anything goes sideways, we\u2019ll have a line of people who can tell the city you fed them correctly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange menu,\u201d Alessandro replied, turning the mug so that the handle faced him as if he had been raised by cups. He smiled in the direction of the glass because he liked to pretend he could see through it when he could not. \u201cConsent. Names. Doors held by both hands. I would eat here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already do,\u201d Ainsworth said when he stepped inside, and he felt the old awkwardness of bringing comfort to the table dressed as authority. He had slept for four hours and dreamt of a colander that tried to teach him the difference between draining and loss, and he forgave himself the metaphor because the day was going to use it anyway. \u201cEat and write. We\u2019ll talk when your pen asks for a rest.\u201d\n\nBy noon the rulebook had pages enough to be flipped through, and flipping them gave off a small wind that rearranged the rosemary leaves like dancers between numbers. Oona arrived with a bag from her bar and the solemnity of a person carrying communion in secular clothes. She unpacked lemons, sugar, and a cluster of little glass jars with their clamp lids cocked like questions, and she set everything on a side table as if staging a scene she wanted the room to learn by heart. \u201cWe\u2019re bottling refusal,\u201d she said, handing Mara a jar the size of a fist. \u201cHouse-made. Smell when you need to remember you have a choice.\u201d\n\nEzra came behind her trying to balance a tray of sandwiches with a napkin that hadn\u2019t decided whether to be cloth or paper. He had that brightness around the eyes you see in line cooks when the lunch rush turns into a story they can retell, and his hands did a quick, nervous dance with the tray before settling. \u201cMy manager didn\u2019t fire me,\u201d he said, and the relief was a little ridiculous and entirely warranted. \u201cHe asked whether the Tickle Writer had a loyalty punch card. When I told him no, he said that meant he was a professional. People think in coupons. It\u2019s how they sleep.\u201d\n\nThe four of them\u2014detective, sergeant, bartender, dishwasher\u2014ate in the safe room with the rulebook open between plates, and it felt less like a summit and more like a family gathering that had never discovered the original reason for itself. Alessandro asked after the bar\u2019s ice machine as if it had been sick and was now convalescing. Oona told him it had started making a knocking sound like someone trapped in a freezer and she had named it Macbeth because a little doom made the shifts go faster. When the laughter came, it was small and living, and nobody reached for it. There was relief in letting it evaporate.\n\nOn the other side of the city, in a room lined with screens that were not screens, the woman in gray watched a model of a bridge flex in tiny increments the way a wrist learns to bend. She had taken her jacket off and hung it on the back of a chair with a precision she did not notice, and her rosemary sprig lay across an open page of notes as if trying to know how language worked. \u201cSubject A has written a charter,\u201d she said into the air, trusting the microphones to decide whether they were microphones today or something else with better manners. \u201cThe charter has spread. The network shows signs of resilience when instructed to isolate. Recommend escalation via social channels. Introduce doubt about consent purity. Note: scent triggers effective.\u201d\n\nThe response came as a line of text rather than a voice, and she liked that because it made her feel like a scientist and not a priest. Proceed, it wrote. Apply noise. Interrupt chain. Extract subject under sanitation protocol. It irritated her that the person or machine who had composed that sentence thought sanitation would sound softer than abduction, just because you could eat in a sanitized room without dying. She pressed her thumb to the rosemary until the scent rose like a committed memory, and she told herself that assessment was not sympathy even though the line between them had gone thin.\n\nBy afternoon, the forum Oona and Ezra had been haunting turned from a lake of good intentions into a river with a current. Posts bloomed and vanished with clean, unnatural regularity, and certain phrases appeared too often to be organic: he doesn\u2019t ask the way he says; he writes your names so he can keep them; laughter is a drug and he is your dealer. Oona set her jaw in the quiet, steady way that made men three inches taller. She opened a new account masking as three older accounts and asked a question that looked stupid and was not: If the problem is that he asks, what would you prefer he do. The thread shivered like a horse under a fly, and even through the algorithmic gloss she saw human fingers hovering, backspacing, hovering again. Doubt was a tool honed against the wrong surfaces.\n\nMara traced the IPs with the casual grace of someone doing scales. Most of the addresses landed where you would expect the internet to live: cheap apartments with laundry machines that ate socks, offices with bad glass, the lobby of a club that had recently redecorated with neon. Three, however, ran under names that sounded municipal without being specific, and one house belonged to a maintenance company that bid on tramline contracts and data storage with equal fervor. She drew lines between it and the building with no blinds and the person in gray that she had decided existed because the world made more sense if it did. Her diagram looked like a constellation of minor gods, all of them in charge of fixtures.\n\n\u201cDo we knock or do we sit on their steps and be heavy,\u201d she asked, tapping her pencil against the name of the maintenance company as if trying to get its attention. The question was for Ainsworth, but she aimed it at the room because rooms keep secrets better than people do.\n\n\u201cWe invite them to dinner,\u201d he said, and Oona choked on a crumb of bread because he meant it. He pulled a legal pad towards him as if it were a cutting board and wrote the names of the people they needed to attend the dinner where nobody would eat. \u201cCompliance from above. Narrative from below. We set out plates for those who wish to speak and do not keep chairs for those who send noise. We make them choose between appetite and appetite for control.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall I bring the candles,\u201d Oona asked, and the game steadied her the way keeping a tray level steadies you in a crowd. \u201cI have the kind that make the air behave. Nobody fights over a table that smells like bergamot.\u201d\n\nThey staged the dinner in the community room two doors down from the safe room because the safe room had learned to be suspicious of gatherings. Ainsworth cooked, because there are some arguments you should only hold with a knife to remind you to be precise. He sliced lemons paper-thin and charred them under a flame until they were bitter enough to make men honest, then glossed them with sugar so his point wasn\u2019t cruel. He smashed rosemary with the flat of his knife and warmed it to release oils that remembered the hillside. He set bowls and wrote name cards with the same hand that had written rules and tried not to notice his f\u2019s looked like Alessandro\u2019s. When the first guests arrived\u2014two from city legal, one from a public-private acronym with too many vowels, a man who had made his career in making risk sound like weather\u2014they blinked at the spread and then remembered their roles. There was a way, Ainsworth knew, that a table could make people say yes to questions they had not yet heard.\n\nAlessandro sat at the end of the table like a story being asked to pour the water. He wore a jacket that did not hide him, because concealment was not his skill, and his hair did an obedient thing that made Ezra itch to muss it out of self-preservation. When the man from the acronym cleared his throat with a sound that abused his Adam\u2019s apple and said, \u201cWe have concerns about your methodology,\u201d Alessandro turned his mouth into a shape that acknowledged the table and the food and the argument before any of the words did. He did not answer first, though. He had learned the rule about not being the first to adore himself out loud.\n\n\u201cConsent is not decoration,\u201d Mara said from the far side, cutting through the scripted opening like slicing a cake that has been fussed over too long. \u201cWe know the difference between an ask and pressure. If your concern is that he has built a frame that holds that difference where people can see it, then say that and don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s anything else.\u201d\n\nLegal counsel leaned back and rearranged her face into one of those expressions that says nothing and everything about billable hours. \u201cOur concern is liability,\u201d she said, and it was almost relief to hear the word said honestly because everyone around the table liked problems you could insure against. \u201cIf a person later decides they did not mean their laughter, if they feel used because their boundaries changed in the act of meeting him, we need to know how we phrase the apology and to whom. Also, the city has a right to know what else is happening under its bridges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city knows,\u201d Oona said, and she spoke as a person who had watch shifts where the door let in heat and mercy and one man who smelled like a threat nobody had ordered. \u201cIt\u2019s the city that asked him to sit there. We picked him, same as we pick landmarks and songs and a corner to be heartbreak corner whether it wants to be or not. You don\u2019t get to take the city\u2019s choices away because the hum in your office wants something you can count.\u201d\n\nAt hum, the acronym man\u2019s eyes flicked, just a notch, and Ainsworth knew the knife had found fat. He poured coffee into cups that had belonged to the room before all of them and let the smell of it be the background noise to what he was about to say. \u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019ve been calling calibration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s invasive. It presumes ownership. You\u2019ve been sending it through our vents and our glass and sometimes our bones. Stop. If you have questions about how human consent works, we have a book. If you have questions about what to do when human consent does not give you the answer you prefer, then we have a rule: the answer stands.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvolution requires iteration,\u201d the acronym man said, and if he had left it there he might have gotten away with sounding like an engineer in an era that admired engines. He did not. He added, softly, \u201cThe city is a lab.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Ezra said, surprising himself into shape. He spoke towards the table and also towards the adults he had decided he might be if he survived his twenties with his laugh intact. \u201cIt\u2019s a kitchen. You can make a mess and you can burn something and you can toss a bad sauce, but you don\u2019t get to replace the people with machines because their hands shake when they slice. Hands are supposed to shake. It means your heart is attached.\u201d\n\nIn the gray room across the river, the woman watching her bridge model breathed a laugh that did not know it was a laugh. She should have felt petulance that her tactic had been named and refused, but the naming was an elegance she could not help admiring. She typed into the light: Contain through PR. Reframe as kink event. Apply shame at scale. She hated herself a little for being good at it. She pressed the side of the rosemary sprig against her collarbone without meaning to and got an oil stain that would never wash out.\n\nDinner ended without a single plate thrown, which felt like a miracle until you remembered that miracles are often just people choosing not to ruin something when they could. The legal counsel took a copy of the rulebook as if it were a puppy she hadn\u2019t yet decided to keep. The acronym man left a card with a number that probably rang somewhere important only on days when power wished to be coy. When the door closed behind the last suit, Oona leaned against the wall and shook out her wrists. \u201cI was good,\u201d she said in the tone of a person checking their own pulse. \u201cI didn\u2019t pour bourbon into anyone\u2019s coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can pour into mine,\u201d Mara said, and then didn\u2019t take her up on it because the day had one more hour of steadiness in it, and she was greedy for it. \u201cWe\u2019ll get calls tomorrow. They\u2019ll want memos and memos about the memos. We\u2019ll write them like recipes.\u201d\n\nThey had barely put the room to rights when the city flickered. It was a small thing, an adjustment in the pitch of the lights and a brief, impersonal scent of antiseptic that came and went in a way calculated to humiliate noses. Alessandro lifted his head like a deer that is not prey until someone reminds it of the taxonomy. Ainsworth did not let the pause become a habit. He lifted his hand and gave the sign they had promised each other: the palm to his chest, the yes that was also the no. \u201cEnough,\u201d he said, and he said it smiling because he had learned that the hum didn\u2019t know what to do with joy.\n\nUnder the bridge, the water made the sound water makes when it decides to argue with stone by making it smooth. A group had gathered there without an invitation, drawn in the way people are drawn to the place where a story tells itself. They were not waiting for Alessandro, though a few among them had the posture of those who would sit when told. They were waiting to see if they could be the ones who answered the tone, the crack in the day where a voice that did not sign its name slid messages into bone. A young woman with blunt-cut hair and a T-shirt that read BODIES ARE TEMPORARY STRUCTURES held her phone up like an offering. \u201cDo you feel\u2014\u201d she began, and then flinched because words are tender if you open with them.\n\nTom\u00e1s stepped forward, the echo of laughter still folded somewhere under his ribs from the night by the water. He looked at their faces and at the shadow on the underside of the arch and at the place on the stone where denim had polished a darker patch, and he set his feet like a decision. \u201cNew rule,\u201d he said, and he was embarrassed and did it anyway because somebody had to lift the sentence. \u201cWe don\u2019t say yes to anything that comes without a face. We don\u2019t say no to each other without looking. We\u2019ll wait with you if you want. We won\u2019t if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA boy with the kind of sunglasses that believe in themselves snorted, because teenagers are correctly suspicious of phrases that would look good on a T-shirt. \u201cWhat if I want to say yes to the hum,\u201d he said, his chin doing the math of irony. \u201cIt feels like being chosen. You\u2019re taking that away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am asking you whether you want the sensation or the choice,\u201d Tom\u00e1s said, and he was not good at this but he had hands that had learned the shape of glasses and he put them in his pockets so they would not get in the way. \u201cThose are two different meals. You should eat the one that will keep.\u201d\n\nBack in the safe room, Alessandro began to write without looking down. The pen moved as if his wrist were listening to something very far away that had been asked to speak softly. He wrote the lemon rule as if it had been obvious all his life and only now had someone taught him the grammar: that the fruit which opened doors can also shut them if you ask it to. He wrote the rosemary rule more slowly, adding names to it that were not names and would only resolve into letters if you smelled the paper while you read. He wrote a line for the boys under the bridge and a line for the bright room and a line for the woman in gray that was not forgiving and not unkind.\n\nEvening came down with that sweetness cities get when everyone who can wash their hands does, when the few who cannot move in the smell of soap as if it were luck. Ainsworth walked through the precinct with the rulebook under his arm and answered nods with the kind of preoccupied smile that keeps questions from becoming interruptions. He paused in the stairwell where the acoustics are always better because stairs like to listen, and he let himself be a man who wanted to laugh. It wasn\u2019t the belly hunger he had expected; it was a small ache right under the breastbone, the place where you store sugar when you don\u2019t want to be caught. He found himself imagining Alessandro\u2019s hands not on him but on the air between them, arranging it into a shape that could hold a sound that had not yet learned how to be born.\n\nMara found him there because she had a habit of checking the places where noise isn\u2019t to make sure the quiet hasn\u2019t eaten anyone. She leaned against the opposite wall and looked like a slogan for stamina. \u201cHead\u2019s-up,\u201d she said. \u201cThe commissioner wants to see the book tonight. The email used the word transparency three times and accountability twice, which is either good faith or someone learning to pronounce mercy in a mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send him a copy with grease on the corner,\u201d he said, and his grin had edges in it he had not seen since the kitchen. \u201cSo he knows it\u2019s been used.\u201d\n\nOutside, the bar on Kemper\u2019s Row filled with the aftertaste of successful standoffs: the small, relieved brags, the sudden generosity, the tips that had the shape of gratitude. Oona made a special that she didn\u2019t write on the chalkboard, a drink that was just water with lemon and a sprig of rosemary and the quiet we pretend belongs to alcohol. She poured it for men who asked as if they were admitting to a failed spell, and she poured it for women who didn\u2019t ask because their faces knew her hand already, and she poured it for herself because bartenders do not get to forget they have bodies just because they are responsible for other people\u2019s. On the TV in the corner that was always tuned to a sports channel someone had muted forever, a caption ran about a minor scandal in a department that had never learned the singular of public. She watched it and felt nothing, then felt guilty for feeling nothing, then set a lemon wheel on a glass with such elegance the guilt apologized and left.\n\nThe hum tried again as the night edged itself into place. It came through the lights in the park and through the speaker in the tram that announces stops and through the defibrillator mounted on the wall next to the timetable, because all public things belong to the hum first if you let them. It said recalibrate in the way bureaucracies say please and normalize in the way rain says you cannot expect to be dry forever. Four people did not answer, and then a fifth, because Tom\u00e1s had taught himself the taste of patience. It turned around twice like a dog trying to make a bed and then lay down outside the places they kept for it.\n\nNear midnight a post reached Oona\u2019s inbox from one of the forum ghosts who had learned a new trick. The account was empty of everything except a sentence that had the shape of a particular building\u2019s internal voice. It said: Protocol change. Physical extraction no longer recommended due to community entanglement. Proceed with narrative erosion via targeted incidents. Seeds: false positives at consent exchanges, reputational dilution, questions about age. The sprig on Oona\u2019s bar cracked its tiniest leaf in the silence that followed because silence is sometimes a fist.\n\nShe forwarded the message to Mara without commentary, and Mara in turn sent it to Ainsworth and Alessandro because there was no other sensible thing to do. Alessandro read it and put his finger on the line about age as if holding it still could keep it from becoming storm. He looked at Ainsworth and saw the way his jaw had learned the shape of that word as a weapon and a wound. \u201cThey want bathroom mirrors to get involved,\u201d he said, the disgust tempered by sorrow the way lemon tempers cream in a curd.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get ahead of it,\u201d Ainsworth said, and it was an oath and not just optimism. \u201cWe\u2019ll write the rule bigger and in more hands. We\u2019ll take all the names off that want off and we\u2019ll learn how to keep the frame without the signatures. People\u2019s bodies are not a rumor, not even when they\u2019re laughing.\u201d\n\nHe sent a message to a reporter he trusted only as far as he could throw her and she could throw him, which turned out to be far enough. She met him at a diner that had promised never to renovate and kept its promise, and he slid the rulebook across the table like a plate of fries you offer and then watch get eaten with a relief you didn\u2019t know you had. She read until her eyes softened and then hardened and then softened. \u201cIf I write this,\u201d she said, stirring her coffee as if it might change flavor. \u201cThey\u2019ll come for me with the angle about enabling. They\u2019re going to say we invited all our sons to a party with an adult who reads their wrists.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can say no,\u201d he said, and the sentence tasted so right he almost laughed. \u201cYou can decide to write about the hum instead. You can decide to write about the bridge. You can write about kitchens if you like. I make a mean charred lemon slice when I\u2019m feeling metaphorical.\u201d\n\nShe smiled with her eyes even though her mouth had other work to do. \u201cWrite about kitchens, he says, as if kitchens weren\u2019t about power,\u201d she said. \u201cFine. I\u2019ll write about rules and about how you wrote them like recipes and I\u2019ll write about boys who know how to breathe again. I\u2019ll write about the humming thing because I like a villain I can\u2019t see.\u201d She tapped the rulebook. \u201cI\u2019ll print it like a pull-out and I\u2019ll get a graphic designer to draw a sprig so detailed nobody will mistake it for garnish. If they come for me, I\u2019ll come to your bar and drink water with lemon out of spite.\u201d\n\nMorning would bring its own weather, but for the length of a night the city agreed to rest because it enjoys being good at something other than surviving. Alessandro slept on a cot in the room without vents, his hands placed carefully on his chest like a man who has learned where to put himself when the world goes too quiet. He dreamt of a kitchen that admitted only laughter and knives that cut only rope, and a bridge that lifted itself by its own belly to let the river under reach to scratch. The white room visited, because it was addicted to its own brightness, and it said recalibrate in the trimmed voice of someone who likes exact clocks, and he answered it by repeating the rule he had written with a detective and a woman who knew where the city kept its patience. The word almost didn\u2019t appear in his dream, which is a miracle the size of a lemon seed and twice as slippery.\n\nAt dawn the maintenance company with the too-clean bids sent a truck with a logo somebody had painted the night before. It idled on Kemper\u2019s Row with the self-possession of a predator that has learned to fake domesticity, and two men in orange vests produced clipboards when Oona stepped out with her arms crossed. \u201cWe\u2019re here to check your vents,\u201d one said, and he lifted his hard hat to scratch his head with the performance of irritation you learn in training. \u201cWe\u2019ve had reports of hum variance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a shame,\u201d Oona said, and she did not move to let them in. She had a way of leaning against her own door that made the door look grateful. \u201cWe\u2019re on an ancient system. It\u2019s allergic to uniforms. You can leave your business card in the slot and a note about your favorite drink and I\u2019ll see if the building feels like being touched next week.\u201d\n\nThe men conferred in the way men do when they must turn one word into a ladder and climb it. The taller of the two made a call that was not a call to anyone who had a mother. He listened and nodded as if nodding was an instruction, then looked back at Oona with the expression of a child told to apologize in front of the class. \u201cWe can reschedule,\u201d he said, and then drove the truck four feet forward into a patch of sunlight where the logo looked less like a word and more like a diagram of compliance.\n\nIn the safe room, Alessandro and Ainsworth began the next page. They had added to the header without noticing: House Rules. Both of them liked the way the word house did not care whether walls were bricks or bodies or a line of people on a bridge who had decided to stand in a wind and not call it bravery. Alessandro drew a small door next to it with a peephole and a hand on the knob from both sides. He did not look at Ainsworth when he asked the question he had been carrying the way people carry pictures of views they want to see again, because he did not want to flavor the answer with his own heat. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter we serve this. Will you let me try.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Ainsworth said, and it didn\u2019t scare him as much as it would have yesterday. He added a line to the bottom of the page that nobody else would be able to read when they copied it into the paper: Detectives are allowed to be citizens. He underlined it once, firmly, and then capped the pen with the small, decisive gesture of a man who is very good at ending things he intends to begin again.",

                              "content": "Chapter 6\n\nThe article arrived while the city was still patting its hair down, its headline a polite throat-clearing above a photograph that showed nothing except a bridge\u2019s curve and a hand-drawn sprig so exact you could smell it. Stacks of paper dozed on stoops, on the counters of bakeries where bread had just admitted its crust, at tram stops where the glass always wore a thin film of the previous day. Ainsworth read it with a slice of toast going cold beside his elbow and butter softening like someone deciding to forgive, and he recognized the hand of the reporter not because of the cadence but because of the places she chose to linger: the recipe shape of the rules; the hum described like weather that has learned to be impersonal; the way boys\u2019 faces look after a good laugh when the body remembers to return them a little lighter than it borrowed them. Oona set a newspaper by the till and flipped to the pull-out she had helped fold, a rulebook printed with lines wide enough to underline and margins generous enough to catch additions, and she thumbed the sprig illustration until a print of rosemary oil appeared on her thumb like a hasty blessing. Ezra read it standing up on his break with dishwater eating his knuckles, mouthing the sentences about names and doors as if learning a song in a language he had always suspected he spoke, and he tucked the insert into the breast pocket of his shirt like a letter he would answer when he had something beautiful to say. Alessandro read, too, at the safe room table, his mouth moving as if in tandem with the journalist\u2019s, and when he came to the paragraph that said, without apology, that a city has the right to write itself, he covered his eyes for a moment as if the text were brighter than morning.\n\nIf the city could be said to react, it did so with the politeness of a person who decides to speak and then checks their teeth in a dark window. There were messages in inboxes and on cheap cardstock postcards slipped under doors, and the forum turned briefly into a company of people pointing at the same sentence and saying yes in different alphabets. There were also the other messages, prepped the way speeches are prepped by men who still believe podiums matter: kink event, they said as if kink were a disease you could spread with a rosemary sprig; exploitation framed in the soft focus of confession; questions about age with the steady drumbeat of someone learning to scout for panic\u2019s tender spots. Accounts that had done nothing but admire architecture for years admitted suddenly to knowing very much about perimeters. The rulebook spread like shade under a summer tree, and at the same time shame tried its ancient tricks, which were less cunning than persistent. Bars put bowls of lemon slices by the water tap with little cards that said House Refusal, take as needed, and offices that prided themselves on being modern found that every break room had one person who, without discussion, pinned a photocopy of Consent is a door both persons hold to the corkboard between a flyer for a futsal league and a notice about leftovers.\n\nMara\u2019s day narrowed itself into purposeful lines. She drafted a protocol with the calm of someone writing a new label for a bottle she intended to reach for often: open hours at the new bridge where sightlines were long and the stone had not yet learned anyone\u2019s weight; consent marshals in bright vests sewn by a seamstress who smiled when told there would be no uniformity except the vest; checks for age that did not humiliate\u2014no boys were to stand alone with policemen; nobody\u2019s name was to be written without the quiet cross of agreement, and even initials would be asked permission before being given mouth. There were tokens, because rituals like to be held in the hand: small circles of pressed paper with a printed sprig on one side and the word yes on the other that could be turned to no and held at the chest like a refusal taught to be visible. Ainsworth disliked the tokens until he handled one; then he liked it too much, the way chefs like good tools even when the talent lies elsewhere, and he made a note to order a box for the precinct so that people would stop using bad pens to draw decisions on sticky notes.\n\nBefore any of it could be tried under the open sky, they went to ground in the safe room and performed the thing the article had only promised in a sentence tucked near the end where the editor had assumed eyes would be tired. It was noon when they began because noon is when knives are honest and the body has admitted its hunger, and Alessandro asked his question the way we ask for salt in a kitchen already fragrant with garlic, with the assumption that the person will understand why more is needed. He did not touch him first. He took the lemon jar and opened it and held it near and then away so the scent could sketch a boundary in the air, and he talked to the smell as if it were a door that could be convinced to get out of its own way. Ainsworth took the token they had made for this moment, the paper circle with its rosemary on one face and the word enough not printed but written by hand on the other, and he held it as if he could transfer into it the right to call an end. There was the hum, of course, standing outside the room like an uncle who gets invited because his absence would be remarked on, and it said recalibrate in a whisper that had not yet learned the difference between whisper and hiss. They did not answer. Alessandro reached for Ainsworth the way a man reaches for a fragile thing he has asked to be put into his hands, with all the aware impatience of someone whose body knows exactly how far to move, and when he skated his fingers along the air just above the fabric where ribs live under names, he did not surprise so much as inform. The first laugh was not large, because Ainsworth is not a man who gives first anything in excess, but it was accurate, the sound you hear when a sugar crust learns it will crack and decides to enjoy it. He laughed and then breathed in like a person who has found his own mouth, and tears came, not because the laugh had asked them but because the body had the habit of pairing them with certain kinds of relief.\n\nThey stopped soon\u2014too soon, Ainsworth would say to himself later with a professional interest in appetite\u2014because rules teach endurance by producing pauses, and he pressed the token to his chest with a palm he did not think to hide because what\u2019s the point of rules if you won\u2019t let them be seen doing their job. Alessandro stepped back with a neatness that will be misunderstood by anyone who has only ever watched clumsy men retreat, and he waited, because waiting is part of what he is built for even if the white room has tried to optimize it out of him. \u201cThat,\u201d Ainsworth said, when breath returned to being air and not a verdict, \u201cis like the moment before service when everyone is in their place and the pass is clean and someone puts the first plate down and you remember what feeding means.\u201d He was embarrassed by his own absence of shame, and he was grateful for it, and he looked at Mara in the glass and did not feel watched so much as kept. After, they wrote together, Alessandro adding a sentence to the House Rules that read as if it had been expecting to be invited: if laughter comes, we will not punish it for being beautiful.\n\nThe counter-move arrived as cleanly as a knife falling off a board because nobody had set it down flat. An account with a careful void where a life would be posted a claim with words arranged to produce a particular flavor of panic, and for a half-hour the forum spilled into timelines with the guilty speed of a spilled drink. The photograph was cropped badly on purpose, and you could tell by the rosemary sprig drawn in the corner that whoever had staged it believed in their ability to mimic a hand. It was perfect in a way that Alessandro never was because he understands that people distrust perfection unless it lands on the tongue as sugar, and Mara held the print in her palms and thought the oldest thought in her trade, which is that lies often arrive in their best shoes. She called the reporter without going through the part of her that prefers to do all waiting herself, and the paper put out a box on the front page before noon that read, in the posture of someone setting a table for an unexpected guest, We have reason to believe this image is staged. We ask you to mind the difference between pattern and person.\n\nThey did not leave it there because people who wish to be believed do not surrender the ground to those who wish to be loud. Oona turned the back room of the bar into an ID clinic by the old-fashioned method of a handwritten sign and a chair as comfortable as paperwork would allow, and men brought their nerves in like dogs and let them sit at their feet while they figured out what their adulthood felt like when described by plastic and stamps. A queer elder named Rafi who had once taught a generation how to find each other with code in a city that pretended ostentation was contempt came with a shoebox full of zines and jokes and scars, and he read aloud from a page printed on a copier that had survived three moves and a raid in eighty-seven, explaining that consent had a history and a future and was not owned by any one group\u2019s bad actors. Alessandro wrote a sentence for the rulebook that tasted like lime because Rafi\u2019s hands smelled of citrus and ink, and the sentence said that age is a fact we respect because it protects the newness that gives laughter its shine.\n\nWhen the open hour came, the bridge behaved like a room that had never expected to host a ceremony and decided to do it correctly. Banners stitched by hands that knew how to make a letter look like a promise snapped lightly in a breeze that had never been told the difference between now and then, and the sprigs printed in the corner of each cloth made the air smell faintly herbal as if from memory rather than plant. The consent marshals stood with their vest pockets full of tokens and their mouths full of quiet instructions and offers of water, and the police who were there did not arrange themselves like a wall so much as like a set of coat hooks; you could hang your worry on them if you wanted, but nobody was going to pretend the hooks made the room warmer. Alessandro\u2019s face did nothing special because he has understood for a long time that special draws trouble in the same way a hot dish draws arms. He took up a place at the edge of the shade where those who wanted to try could see his hands before they felt them, and he talked first not about laughter but about how to stop. He showed the token; he pressed his own palm to his chest with theatre that had the decency to admit it was theatre; he asked anyone who was not yet sure whether they wanted to be written down to take the paper copy of House Rules and read it as if it were a love letter that might or might not be meant for them.\n\nWhen Tom\u00e1s stepped up, Oona saw the shiver on his jaw that meant he was going to do a brave thing at the right size, and Ezra, from the second row with his hat in his hands because he had decided it helped, made the sign on his own chest as if to teach the air to translate. Alessandro asked his question and Tom\u00e1s answered yes like a man checking a door twice before walking through it, and the laughter that came out of him sounded like a knot remembering how to yield. People leaned, because humans always do when they think someone might drop something, and the moment held. From the road a truck the exact bland white of assumption inched into view with three men in vests more fluorescent than the marshals\u2019 and a logo that had been painted so recently you could see the brush marks pretending to be pixelation. They were The Maintenance Company, which is to say they were any company that has learned to move through a city because the city has learned to need it, and they had clipboards and a form named Sanitation Protocol stapled to itself so aggressively that it seemed to resent its own paper. They meant to come under the bridge not to clean anything but to enact a cleansing of the sort that ends conversations instead of trash.\n\nThey did not get the timing they wanted. The tram driver who preferred the old bell to the newer, softer ding came around the curve and saw the truck, the vests, the posture of a crowd about to be interrupted by men with clipboards, and she slowed in a way that could later be defended as prudent. The tram occupied the angle the truck needed with the casual arrogance of public transport, and pigeons wheeled because pigeons like a punctum in a narrative, and Mara walked up with the stride of someone who has collected signatures before from people pretending their hands were too important to hold pens. \u201cYou can come when the river asks you to clean,\u201d she said without raising her voice because the sound system had learned to be nice a long time ago. \u201cUntil then, we are cooking. Steam is not a health code violation.\u201d\n\nLegal counsel had come to see whether her stomach would behave in public, and she stepped to Ainsworth\u2019s side with an expression that said she had been thinking about verbs all morning. \u201cThey have nothing,\u201d she said, which is a lawyer\u2019s way of saying not yet, and the acronym man was nowhere because there are people who prefer to be the hum rather than the face and they had already been denied their venue. Alessandro\u2019s hand hovered above Tom\u00e1s\u2019s forearm where they had decided touch was safe, and he did not let the interruption become a story about interruption. He let it be a gesture instead, and the laughter, polite as guests that have learned how to make a host feel competent, returned.\n\nAfter the crowd thinned and the truck had backed itself into a corner where the sun showed its pretense, a woman with a gray jacket the color of decisions watched from the lip of the plaza and then did a surprising thing: she came down the steps into Oona\u2019s bar and sat at the end where there was less chance of being cataloged merely for having touched a stool. She ordered water with lemon and watched as the bartender added a sprig because that is the house recipe when you are uncertain of your own motives, and she held the glass with both hands in a way that made the rosemary\u2019s shadow lay a neat stripe over the word printed on her jacket\u2019s inside tag. \u201cYou\u2019re not from any of the offices in the building with no blinds,\u201d Oona said, because the kindest pretense is acknowledgment. The woman smiled the way you do when someone picks the right card twice. \u201cI wear my own name,\u201d she said, which was not an introduction but would do. \u201cThey will try something you don\u2019t expect, and it will not be the trucks. It will be a story that makes boys concerned about other boys. It will have the shape of care. It will smell faintly of antiseptic. Do what you did today. Set a table first and they will knock.\u201d\n\nOona waited, because waiting makes liars nervous, and the woman drank her water with the posture of a person who had never learned to accept citrus without reading it like code. She put money on the bar and then a small card with nothing on it but a phone number and a dot in the corner, and the dot was the color of rosemary when it thinks about turning into smoke. \u201cWe are not merciful,\u201d the woman said, as if admitting it out loud were maintenance, and Oona tucked the card into the jar of refusal until the paper softened around the edges like a truth that has sat with the thought of itself. When the woman left, Oona texted Mara with the number and added no commentary because she trusts a reader to taste a note without having it pointed to.\n\nNight arrived with a temperature you could hold, and the city tried on gentleness the way a jacket tries on a person. Alessandro wrote until the joints in his hand told time not with pain but with the fatigue that delights because it means the day asked something of you. He added to House Rules with the carefulness of a person tucking a child in: no recordings without both parties signing; no names on cardboard; no laughing for the sake of a picture; laughter is not evidence, including for yourself. Ainsworth cleaned his knives although he did not need to because cooks lie when they say there is a difference between peace and preparation, and he taped the copy of the rulebook to the inside of a cupboard door where people used to keep prayer cards. He thought of tomorrow, because men like him keep their joys on a schedule, and tomorrow is when he had said out loud that he would permit more laughter, in a room with vents he could unplug, with lemon on the table and rosemary upright like a yes.\n\nSomewhere in the brightness above ground level, a maintenance room listened to itself hum and liked the sound a little too much. The white rectangle that masqueraded as a screen told the woman in gray what she already knew\u2014that narrative erosion had been slowed not by force but by recipes\u2014and she typed Proceed to contamination protocol with the fatalism of a clerk at a temple. The answer came back in a font she could not respect, and it read as if written by a manager of a building where managers believed the building could be taught to smile: We cannot contaminate what will not host. Move to rumor dispersal at educational nodes. Offer \u201cresources\u201d to \u201cconcerned parties.\u201d Apply pressure to institutions who like to look immaculate. She closed her eyes for a moment because the word immaculate made her unreasonably tired. Before she left, she peeled the oil-hardened rosemary leaf off her lapel and placed it in a petri dish, and the lab, which was not a lab, recorded the way the scent altered the room and did not learn what it needed because you cannot learn about houses by burning doors.\n\nAt the last tram, Tom\u00e1s walked home under a sky that had remembered stars despite the city\u2019s habit of forgetting, and he folded his used token in half and then half again until it became a tiny yes he could lose on purpose. A boy no older than him and perhaps older in the ways you count without counting walked beside him for a half-block and then asked, not with the rulebook\u2019s grammar but with the sincerity rules try to protect, \u201cWhat if I never want to be touched again. Does that mean nobody like him loves me.\u201d Tom\u00e1s answered without thinking, because the answer was obvious once you had watched someone ask correctly for a week. \u201cIt means he loves you exactly as much as you want to be loved,\u201d he said, and they stood under a streetlight long enough to convince it to buzz, and then they went their separate ways feeling watched by something that wanted only for them to remember.\n\nPast midnight, the reporters\u2019 story refreshed on the paper\u2019s site with an addendum that was not a correction, and it read like a note left on a refrigerator by a housemate who has gone to buy lemons and will return: we will be at the bridge tomorrow; we will bring copies for anyone who wants to hold their own yes; we will print a diagram showing how to stop when you forget; we will not be bullied by men who think the hum makes them gentle. In the safe room Alessandro slept with the cup holding the rosemary on the table beside him, and he dreamed of Ezra\u2019s hands making napkin roses and Oona teaching the hum to go outside for a smoke, and he dreamed of a kitchen where the only thing on the menu was laughter in four courses with pauses, and he dreamed of a white room flicking its lights twice in irritation and then sitting down because there were not enough chairs to continue standing without looking ridiculous. At dawn the river lifted its surface and practiced being glass for a minute, and the bridge looked in and was not horrified by what it saw, and in the precinct a detective with butter under his nails and the memory of a laugh waking a place behind his ribs made coffee and added lemon zest to it, not to drink, but to smell, so that his hands would know what to do when the day began to hum again.",

House Rules had found their way onto magnet boards and inside cabinet doors and into the small photo pockets of wallets that otherwise housed children and dogs, and there was a nervous sweetness to the way people greeted one another that morning, as if the word enough had learned to ride in the mouth next to hello. Ainsworth brewed coffee with the zest of a lemon pinched between finger and thumb, then wiped the tiny oil slick his hands left on the tin with a napkin he had washed and saved from a restaurant that had failed with dignity, and he sat with the rulebook open and a pencil ready not to cross anything out but to add a line if the day demanded new grammar. The precinct made noises that were ordinary and therefore revolutionary, phones researching the difference between rumor and report, computers pretending to be chests that would hold a breath until you remembered to retrieve it, desks accepting elbows like old friends who knew better than to ask questions before nine.\n\nAt the technical college near the tram yard, an email arrived that had the posture of a grandmother worried about \u201cgoings-on.\u201d It was composed in complete sentences with proper commas by a consortium that preferred the word concerned to angry because concerned sounded like a better suit, and it asked the administration to clarify whether \u201cevents of a laughter-based nature\u201d would be permitted on school grounds, as if laughter were a chemistry lab that might explode without an adult in the room. Dean Peri\u2014whose first name was a story her mother had decided to keep to herself\u2014read it and thought of the taste of iron that classrooms got when policy outweighed pedagogy, then sent a reply that copied three departments and contained the sentence, \u201cConsent frameworks will be observed with a rigor commensurate to any other experimental endeavor,\u201d and then sat on her hands to avoid typing, \u201cPlease meet me under the bridge if you find yourself forgetting the difference between care and control.\u201d Mara and Ainsworth were already on their way because some mornings announce themselves as preemptive, and Oona had packed a small case with lemons, rosemary, tape, and a stack of tokens that behaved like coins without buying anything except time.\n\nThey found the auditorium humming in the way large rooms hum when the electricity believes in its responsibilities a little too much, a suspicion of static that makes hair wonder if wind has developed indoor privileges. A panel had assembled itself with the reflex of academia to gather a table between itself and trouble, and there were name placards with crisp black letters that existed mostly to remind their owners that names are not only for saying, but for wearing. The Concerned had arrived in their civilian uniforms of good intentions, and scattered among them like garnish were the operatives of the hum, identifiable only because they looked at the vents when phrases like \u201cduty of care\u201d were spoken out loud. The dean stood up and placed House Rules next to the agenda with the calm of a person who knows that a list that fits on one page is often more useful than a binder, and she nodded toward the back of the room where Mara had arranged herself with a notebook and the good posture she uses when showing her spine to a crowd with love.\n\n\u201cWe are here to confirm that our campus is a place where laughing is permitted, stopping is permitted, and names do not go where their owners do not send them,\u201d the dean said, and she had the sort of voice that had learned to be kind even when she was annoyed. \u201cWe will not hold events that pretend at permission. We will hold events where ending an action is a practiced skill. If that confuses you, we have handouts. If it continues to confuse you, we have doors that lead outside, and I say that with affection.\u201d\n\nA man in a sweater the color of artificial grass cleared his throat with a commitment to being remarked upon. He pointed to the pull-out of the newspaper as if it were evidence rather than invitation and asked whether \u201cadult practitioners\u201d would be permitted to solicit on campus \u201ceven if their intentions are pure,\u201d and he did it with the particular emphasis of someone who has learned to burn words with friction. Mara watched the hum lean in through the light cans, patient as infection, and she lifted her hand to her chest with the token facing outward so it caught the fluorescents and returned them in a fan of rosemary-green light. A small chorus rose around the room as students and staff who had learned the gesture in bars and on buses and under bridges mirrored her without needing to speak, and the auditorium, which had been considering whether to choose panic, chose demonstration instead. The hum stumbled, because it had learned to expect men to bristle and women to smooth rather than a group to simply hold up a circle of paper with a leaf on it.\n\nAinsworth took his turn with the microphone because his job relies on the ability to talk without sounding as if talking yields results by itself, and he kept it personable not because he did not have steel in him but because steel is a better utensil than a microphone. \u201cOur position as a department,\u201d he said, \u201cis that the moment you tell adults in public they cannot laugh because you might be worried about what comes after the laugh you have to show your badge to the part of yourself that prefers neatness to care. We are here to enforce the rules written by those who will be touched, if they will be touched. We are present when there are tokens in pockets and lemon slices on the table and a speaker with a failing plug that we\u2019ll get replaced because the hum isn\u2019t invited to speak through school equipment.\u201d He gestured toward the back, where Oona had quietly taped a paper sign to the water dispenser that read House Refusal\u2014take, and the students laughed not at the joke but at the relief of a room where someone had remembered to bring the particular kind of mercy that looks like a wedge floating in clear water.\n\nEzra missed the hearing because the Bluemme was visited by a health inspector with a flinty smile and little regard for the way bodies move around each other when there is too much glassware and not enough forgiveness. The inspector had a laminated badge with a signature that looked like it had been forced to agree with itself, and he ran a white-gloved finger along the bar rail like a father in an old movie who has mistaken cleanliness for love. \u201cWe\u2019re checking,\u201d he said, \u201cfor additional\u2026 gatherings,\u201d and the pause before the word was where he stored his discomfort. Ezra nodded and showed him the ice bin and the syrup bottles, the sprig jar labeled rosemary\u2014not garnish, resource, and the tokens in a stack in the back, newly ordered, with a note that read: ask someone if you can borrow one and watch what happens to their breath. The inspector, to his credit, wrote mints available and House Rules posted and did not write anything he would not be proud for his name to be held next to, and he left with a lemon slice in his pocket because Ezra, on impulse, had fed him the idea that carrying refusal could be a pleasure if you decided not to use it right away.\n\nBack in the precinct, the number Oona had slid into the jar of refusal whispered something less than a call and more than a test tone. Mara took it because she trusts her own ear to tell her when she is being auditioned, and the woman in gray filled the line lightly, not like a person whispering but like a person who has learned that if she speaks above a certain pitch the room tries to answer. \u201cThey\u2019re moving off trucks,\u201d the woman said, as if admitting to an allergy. \u201cThey will try a first-aid angle. They will appear at places where teenagers learn to be twenty with clipboards and pamphlets about \u2018laughter addiction\u2019 and \u2018unwanted stimulation,\u2019 and they will arrive with a paramedic\u2019s confidence and a mall kiosk\u2019s persistence. If you wish to be ready, teach your marshals to ask for credentials without being charmed by fonts. Teach your boys and your women and everyone else you have decided to love where to stand when an adult says, \u2018Come with me\u2019 and the sentence has less blood than usual because it was composed by a committee.\u201d Mara listened, wrote, and did not say thank you until the end because gratitude, misdeployed, can make a person think they have purchased your obedience.\n\nThey staged practice outside the precinct in the same way the city stages rain: thoroughly and with a refusal to apologize for repetition. Consent marshals\u2014students, bartenders, men in unions familiar with crossing guard duty when the buses run late\u2014lined up to receive lanyards that did not make them police but made them visible companies of calm. They took turns playing rescuer and rescued, practicing the phrase, \u201cI decline,\u201d in registers that would travel without cracking. They learned to ask, \u201cMay I see the name on your certification,\u201d and to stand in such a way that a person standing behind them would be visible in a photo, because visibility is often a better lawyer than rules are. Alessandro watched from the doorway with his thumbs pressed together like a man praying to a god he distrusts, and Ainsworth saw the fidget of the right hand and knew it was time to keep his own promise.\n\nThey went to the room that had learned to hold its breath without making it into theatre, and Ainsworth placed the token in his pocket and then took it out and set it on the table because pockets are for secrets and this needed to be observable by the part of him that writes memos. Alessandro did not touch him first; he set a lemon slice on the table and explained to it, as if it might not have read the rules yet, that it was a gate and that he would only lift it if Detective would like to walk through. The hum arrived because that is what hums do when it fears being ignored, and it spoke into the metal of the table leg in its best school-assembly voice. \u201cRecalibrate,\u201d it said, and it was possible that the vents rolled their eyes. Ainsworth nodded to it as you nod to a relative who has not learned about moderation, then turned to Alessandro and said yes in a way that would fit in any kitchen he had ever run.\n\nThe first touch was not a touch, not exactly, but a reading. Alessandro set his hand an inch above the path the ribs make when names have tired them out, and he moved it slowly the way you move a knife when you slice a tomato with respect rather than hunger, and the nerves under Ainsworth\u2019s skin remembered their job like staff reminded of service after a long slow afternoon. When it came, the laugh did not arrive with trumpets; it arrived with a sound he had not given anyone since a dinner ruined for the best possible reasons, a small break in the voice where sugar cracks and the spoon goes through. The laugh startled him because it did not ask him for an apology, because it did not ask him to become less in order to fit inside it, because it did not take any of the knives away after. It came with an inhalation that tasted of citrus he had not eaten, and tears came in the way tears sometimes accompany onions, as a kind of brine the body provides so the cutting can proceed with less friction. He pressed the token to his chest because ignoring the mechanism you designed is an insult to the version of you who was very clever while writing it, and Alessandro stepped back with the neatness of a good waiter and the relief of a man allowed to love something he had not broken.\n\nAfter, they wrote. They wrote in the way cooks replace salt with lemon when salt is not the point, and in the way city clerks add a line item to documents so the next time there is less searching. They wrote that officers are permitted to laugh in rooms without making their partners uneasy. They wrote that laughter is not a confession and that sorrow is allowed to be a side effect without anyone heroizing it. They wrote that when a hum says normalize you are allowed to be abnormal and when it says hold you are allowed to let go. Ainsworth, who had known for years how to plate something beautiful and then not eat it, had a second mouthful and did not punish himself for being changed by it.\n\nThe rumor campaign moved, as predicted, to the places where people like to pretend they are objective: clinics, help desks, email addresses with the word resource in them. Flyers appeared in college hallways printed on ethics paper with serif fonts and a faint watermark of a caduceus that had never seen actual medicine, asking, \u201cDo you feel pressured by laughter?\u201d and \u201cIs tickling a gateway?\u201d and \u201cAre older men making your boundaries blurry?\u201d They were positioned at eye-level and humanized by stock photos of hands not quite touching, and the effect was oily and precise. The counter came as community rather than argument. Rafi and his cadre of elders and cousins and younger men who wanted to be older someday in a way that included forgiveness set up in the student lounge with a tabletop printer and a stack of blanks and ran a \u201cWrite Your Own Poster\u201d station with stencils in fonts closest to the ones that had been weaponized. The wall filled with answers the room could live with: \u201cMy boundary is a light switch I control,\u201d \u201cLaughter is not a drug because it doesn\u2019t come in a bottle,\u201d \u201cIf I change my mind during, that\u2019s part of the recipe,\u201d \u201cNo is a dessert, you can have it any time and you\u2019ll still be invited back.\u201d By evening, the flyers that had been printed with antiseptic had nowhere clean to cling to, and they curled in on themselves like bread that had been mis-measured and succumbed to air.\n\nA second maintenance truck appeared without a logo and then, seeing itself observed by ten pairs of eyes that had learned to evaluate the difference between service and extraction, acquired a magnetic sign that said TEMP VENTALATION in a font that did not know its own spelling. It turned up on a block where laughter had moved indoors because the weather had, and it parked crooked as if speed would make permission, and a man went inside a dance studio with a tote bag marked First Aid that contained none. He found himself politely surrounded by four marshals who smelled faintly of rosemary because Oona sprays the vests with a solution that turns rooms into kitchens, and he presented a badge that insisted on being held at arm\u2019s length. \u201cEmergency protocol,\u201d he said, and it sounded like a phrase he had learned in a language class and not on a sidewalk. \u201cWe\u2019ve been told to collect individuals displaying signs of overstimulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you mean joy,\u201d a marshal asked, and the man faltered not because she had trapped him but because he liked that word better and knew it, and in that micro-consent to a better vocabulary the scene deflated. The dance studio\u2019s owner, who had been through enough lockdown drills to have an evacuation plan for a rumor, handed him a copy of House Rules and a slice of lemon in a zip-top bag with a label that read: For When You Want To Say No To Your Boss. Later, someone peeled the maintenance magnet from the truck with the leisure of a person deciding which sticker to remove from a suitcase so TSA would not make assumptions, and the side of the van was revealed as the white it had always been, the absence of language visible and faintly embarrassed.\n\nIn a brief, unscheduled quiet at the bar, Oona poured the water special for the woman in gray because that was now how their arrangement worked, and the woman drank it as if citrus might contain information she could carry back in her mouth and not spill. \u201cThey will try children next,\u201d she said, not theatrically, but the sentence still made the air want to recalibrate around it. \u201cNot children-children,\u201d she added, recognizing the threshold she had almost crossed, \u201cbut the kind of new that makes twenty-one look like a cliff. They will frame it as protection because that is the only reliable seduction they have left. If you love them, make it boring to accuse you. Put clipboards in their hands. Let them cancel things without having to apologize.\u201d Oona imagined the white room hearing the phrase make it boring and the sneer that would come across a surface that thought itself irresistible, and she smiled despite herself because the best advice is often stupid when summarized.\n\nThe hum, finding itself starved of panic in academic rooms and dance studios and bars where water with lemon had become a trend that outperformed microbrews, went municipal. It spoke through the transit screens that tell you when a bus will arrive if that bus has remembered that it is timely, and it sent a message allegedly from the city that read, \u201cPUBLIC HEALTH ADVISORY: Avoid unregistered laughter gatherings,\u201d with a link to a page that would not load because the city\u2019s web team follows the rule about links; they must lead somewhere or you risk being a liar at scale. The team shut the message off in one sweep like a chef turning down all burners to catch a kitchen that had begun to thrill itself, and then pinned a correction on the city\u2019s front page the size of their shame: \u201cWe did not write that sentence. We are learning that our screens are also doors.\u201d\n\nEvening suggested itself like a soft shoulder you don\u2019t yet dare lean on. Under the bridge, there was a soundcheck of pigeons and a map of people who had found the rules not deterrent but delicious. The consent marshals were less stiff in their vests; they had learned where to put their hands when they were not being needed, and the bright, silly tokens caught sunset and made pocketfuls of green light that were not metaphor but sensation. Alessandro stood with his hand on the sprig on the table like a man touching the name of someone whose presence makes him coherent, and he kept his profile relaxed because being a vessel requires not announcing yourself constantly as important to the pouring. Tom\u00e1s brought his friend with the BODIES ARE TEMPORARY STRUCTURES shirt and they stood in a way that said they had learned to anchor each other discreetly, and Ezra took his hat off because none of this should be costume except deliberately.\n\nThe maintenance world\u2019s answer did not arrive on wheels but in a whisper dressed as a headline. A rumor sprouted in a narrow lobby near the law courts where the cleaning staff store their sweaters, a story about a seventeen-year-old who had been \u201clured\u201d by a \u201cman with rosemary\u201d under \u201cthe old bridge.\u201d It went from mouth to post to prophecy in an hour because the story had a shape audiences recognize from other industries, and the world is tempted by familiarity in the same way it is tempted by sweets. It crossed Mara\u2019s desk because the bar staff know how to send her smoke when there is no fire, and she did the thing a good officer does when fear wears a familiar coat; she looked first at the boy. He was eighteen and a half and had been eighteen at the time and had a wristband on from a nightclub that had installed its own rules when the owner fell in love with a girl who taught him no could be an offering. He did not look particularly abused by anything except work, and he had the wide, tired mouth of a person who stays up out of pride. He watched the rumor being clarified into his own name with confusion that faced more north than south, and he said, \u201cI laughed because I wanted to,\u201d and the officers in the secret half-moon of the room put their pens down because the rest of the question was not for writing.\n\n\u201cWe need stewards,\u201d Rafi said at the next planning meeting, and the word lay on the table like a well-oiled tool everyone had forgotten they owned. \u201cNot marshals. Marshals keep a perimeter. Stewards keep a story.\u201d He recruited from the choir at the community center and from bartenders who had kept their nerve when the lights go out, and from mothers who had taught sons to hold grocery bags and promises, and they formed a circle that met people like receptionists with excellent posture and better boundaries. They were the ones who listened when someone came with a fear that would not fit in a comment box, and they stayed when the room emptied, and they were not asked to forgive anyone for anything except the error of having learned their skepticism from bad examples. Alessandro gave them a page in House Rules, and he wrote in a hand that did not trouble itself to appear human because these words were work and not seduction, that stewards answer questions before the hum can, and that if a story arrives with its ending nailed down you are allowed to pry it open.\n\nThe woman in gray sent a package that arrived at the precinct without a return address and with fewer flourishes than a broom handle. Inside was a sheet that looked like a recipe if recipes were written by people who had never eaten, a list of phrases that had the authority to trip certain bodies into compliance: recalibrate, normalize, hold, sanitize, extraction, protocol, safety, incident, escalation. There were marginal notes in a hand that belonged to the woman, not her employers, and they read, in an ordinary ink that had not decided to perform, rename these. They spent an hour of the afternoon doing exactly that, not because words are magic but because naming habits keeps them from colonizing rooms. They wrote instead, breathe; instead, soften; instead, wait; instead, wash your hands before touching; instead, walk someone home; instead, plan; instead, check the stove; instead, rise. Oona took the sheet and put it next to the prep list at the bar, and before last call a man who had never met a protocol he did not admire had caught himself saying plan where he would have said escalate, and he did not feel impotent for it, and the night thanked him by refusing to become a mess.\n\nLate became later in the way cities permit it, with a subtext of closings and openings exchanging glances no more sinful than inevitable. Alessandro went to the bridge with his notebook and found a new, small pile of rules at the corner where boys had placed other offerings, and he read them the way a chef reads receipts at the end of service, counting not to punish but to know. He added one. He wrote, Joy is not evidence, fear is not proof, and he underlined it because some sentences like handle and you should install one. Ainsworth came and stood halfway up the steps where you can look like you are considering home or away and not commit, and he folded his hands because empty hands have become unfashionable in a world that equates them with uselessness, and he held them anyway. When Alessandro looked up, they shared a nod that had learned not to communicate urgency every time it had something to say, and they stood a while watching the river forget and remember itself between pilings.\n\nThe city, which had always known how to queue for tragedy, tried lining up for tenderness instead and found that the line moved faster and the snacks were better. Screens that had been commandeered for rehearsals of fear were now full of rosemary sprigs drawn by technicians who had decided they too were citizens, and someone had replaced the system\u2019s error tone with a chord from a song you could hum to yourself while waiting for the kettle. The hum attempted to hold a note over the city like a nuisance tenor and discovered that a chorus is louder not because it wishes to be, but because it remembers to breathe, and it backed down with the sulk of a machine that has never been taught to lose.\n\nNear midnight, before the long, low hour when trams rest and cleaning crews inherit the world, a boy named Niles, who had been born in a country that taught him to stand upright even when the roof is low, presented himself to a steward with his yes in his hand and his no in his pocket and asked to be shown the difference in a room with windows. He laughed once and then put his hand over his chest and laughed twice, and his breath drew in like a tide he had forgotten he grew up beside, and he stood taller afterward not because pleasure makes you big but because permission removes a weight. The steward wrote down his words because rules are stronger when they are stitched to a human sentence, and she added his line to the bottom of House Rules where there is always space if you stop pontificating about the bottom: You can stop because it is Friday, you can stop because the song is over, you can stop because you have decided to save your laugh for someone who remembers your middle name, and nobody will charge you fees.\n\nUp in the room that had learned to carry a night without humming, Alessandro slept with the notebook under his palm not as a security measure but as a habit of wishing to feel the world continuing to make language he could keep up with, and the white room came and knocked with its knuckles instead of its tone. \u201cRecal\u2014\u201d it began, and then paused, perhaps to turn the page of a manual that had not previously contained an appendix for failure, and he said, because he had practiced, \u201cNew rule,\u201d and the bright room, having no name, could not enter. In the morning he woke to the smell of zested coffee that someone had left outside the door because kindness is a way of winning even when you have lost, and he smiled into the steam the way one smiles into a mirror after a haircut that knows your head better than you did yesterday, and he said aloud to nobody and everyone, \u201cWe will need a chapter on festivals,\u201d because ceremonies have always been one of the more elegant ways to keep machines from eating your calendar.",

The word festival let the city dress in ordinary clothes and still arrive at something ceremonial, and it suited House Rules to be sung rather than enforced, repeated rather than announced. Ainsworth sat with the notebook open to an empty page titled in a hand that did not need to pretend to be human, Chapter on Festivals, and he chewed the end of a pencil the way a cook tastes steam to decide if a stock needs attention. The rules for a gathering, he wrote, should obey the smaller rules we use when we feed each other: greet at the door; label the heat; make sure there is water; make sure there is a way out that does not feel like failure. Alessandro watched his hand move and did not comment on the way the f\u2019s had learned his flourish, because imitation can be an intimacy that does not require confession.\n\nThey found a space that was not under a bridge and also did not insist on forgetting bridges existed. The park by the tram depot had trees old enough to counsel and benches that had accepted every shape of grief a city can produce without taking sides, and there were power outlets that the hum would want and they would learn to deny elegantly. Oona walked the perimeter with the stride of a person counting exits while the rest of company pretended not to learn from her, and she tapped the fence posts with two fingers as if testing whether the wood remembered being a tree. \u201cWe will need a stage that is not a stage,\u201d she said, and Mara wrote it down because logistics is the art of making metaphors behave. \u201cSomething low enough to step off without announcing descent, but high enough that those in the back can see the hands.\u201d\n\nAinsworth did not so much volunteer to feed the crowd as accept the inevitability that crowds expect to be fed. He called his ex-wife because the rules of large pots still respect the person who first taught you to stir without scraping the bottom, and when she answered there was a clean moment between their sentences that did not sting. Leda had moved on from restaurants to a kitchen that taught children to trust heat, and she listened as he described a city that was learning to call a rulebook a cookbook and said, \u201cI have steel trays and a team that believes in feeding people before talking to them.\u201d She arrived with the efficient tenderness of someone who had refused to stay married to a knife without divorcing the craft, and when she saw Alessandro she gave him the slow, appraising nod that chefs reserve for colleagues they are not yet sure they admire. \u201cYou the one with the rosemary,\u201d she said, and he smiled as if she had remembered a birthday he had not known he had.\n\nThe woman in gray told herself she would not go, because attending a ceremony designed to starve your program is a bad habit even when you are fond of bad habits. She went anyway, late, in a jacket that remembered her shoulders and with a notebook she did not open, and she stood at the edge as if testing whether the air would take her side. Her employers had already pivoted to a plan with the ghastly charm of good stationery: pop-up \u201ccare tents\u201d with clipboards, folding chairs, a caduceus that had never seen an ambulance, and a form letter that turned laughter into a symptom in twelve sentences or less. She watched two of those tents arrive with the well-meaning speed of a bad idea, and she watched them hesitate because the path they wanted to roll across had been taken up by tables bearing water and lemon and the sprigs printed in the corners of paper cups like signatures invited everywhere.\n\nThe first festival rule they posted was not about laughter; it was about light. Strings of bulbs had been hung from tree to tree by men who used to rig concerts and still did sometimes when joy paid better than sorrow, and their hum was human when it came on and human when it went down. \u201cIf the lights flicker outside the wind,\u201d the card read, \u201cwe will pause. We will look at each other. We will remind the room who owns the plug.\u201d People practiced looking up and then at faces and then back at the bulbs, and the act became a kind of communion that did not require common belief. The second rule was about water and the third about names and the fourth about stopping, and when the fifth turned out to be about quiet\u2014\u201cWe take a minute on the hour to let the river check in\u201d\u2014the festival gained the gravity that makes a temporary place feel like a town.\n\nIt would have been a relief if the hum had made itself obvious in some theatrical way, a truck with a siren or a man with an armband, but bureaucracy has learned to avoid dramatics when a whisper will do. The care tents unfolded at the far edge of the lawn with the discouraging beauty of good design, and two women and a man took their seats with the predatory calm of professionals who believe their resumes are moral. The sign said, \u201cAre you unsure about what happened under the bridge?\u201d and the font did too much work while pretending not to. Stewards arrived before anyone else could, bearing clipboards of their own that did not occlude faces and chairs with backs that did not encourage leaning away, and they sat down opposite and turned their badges around to show the blank side. \u201cWe are making sure you know we\u2019re volunteers,\u201d Rafi said to the woman who had been taught to smile only when someone was in trouble, and his grin was the kind that made sternness remember its youth.\n\nAlessandro stood on the not-stage and explained the tokens again for those who had not yet held one and those who needed to hear the explanation in ceremony, and his hands did the demonstration without being authoritative. He did not invite any particular body up first, because hierarchy ruins more afternoons than malice does, and instead he asked for anyone who wanted to demonstrate stopping to join him at the table with the rosemary. Tom\u00e1s raised his hand with the ease that comes from the right difficulty in practice, and a woman in a green headscarf lifted hers, and a man with shoulders made by a warehouse not a gym stepped forward with a laugh already coiled behind his ribs like a good spring. They showed the pause, the palm to chest, the yes you can carry with you when you go home and the no you can leave in the pocket for later, and the crowd did that soft exhale cities manage when they admit they are watching something worth remembering.\n\nThe rumor that had been prepared to detonate tried to sprint into the moment with the breathlessness of news, and it tripped. The first iteration\u2014\u201cUnderage boy tricked by rosemary man\u201d\u2014hit Oona\u2019s phone with a ping that had learned not to be charming, and it landed on the stewards\u2019 table already dressed for burial. The boy in question had filmed himself in his mother\u2019s kitchen, holding up the paper that said eighteen with the impatience of a person who does not want to become content, and he said, in a voice that could not improvise duplicity if you paid it, \u201cI asked. I laughed. I ate cereal. I want to keep my job.\u201d The clip played above the care tent because the bulb strings had decided the tents should advertise themselves honestly, and the crowd\u2019s attention moved like a flock away from danger disguised as resource and towards the sentence that restored scale. The tent staff found themselves offering pamphlets to one another because it was important to be doing something with their hands.\n\nLeda ran her kitchen from a tarp with the calm you only earn by burning things in youth and surviving to make jokes about it later. She served charred lemon over unflustered greens and bread that had no trick except being bread, and she refused money with the ferocity of a person who had been tipped badly on principle and didn\u2019t intend to be again. She had cut her hair short during a summer that had not made sense and she wore a bandanna like a declaration of allegiance to function, and when a man in a vest that said SANITATION tried to step under her prep tent she looked at his shoes and said, \u201cYou\u2019re tracking something I don\u2019t let in,\u201d and he apologized without knowing why. Ainsworth wiped down a board for the pleasure of it and because hanging on to small cleanliness is an act of resistance when the day wants scale, and he watched Leda catch Alessandro in her lens for the first time without translating him into metaphor. \u201cYou\u2019re precise,\u201d she said when he took a cup of water with lemon and didn\u2019t drink it. \u201cI can work with precise.\u201d\n\nThe woman in gray let herself be mistaken for someone whose job did not require confession, and she approached Mara at the edge of the rosemary table with her hands visible and her name on her lips as if that could be weaponized, which it can. \u201cI\u2019m Kira,\u201d she said, and the sound of it made one of the bulbs blink as if it had recognized a shape. \u201cIf I tell you that my job has recently become describing people as processes, will you let me sit without telling me that\u2019s a sin.\u201d Mara\u2019s expression did the small change it does when she is measuring mercy, and she pushed a chair with her foot without breaking eye contact because posture matters when you invite the enemy for water. \u201cWe are currently short on chairs for repentance,\u201d she said, and she said it with enough humor that the permission became something other than absolution.\n\nKira watched a steward instruct a care-tent worker in the art of interrupting themselves before they caused damage as if she were at a demonstration of a new machine that might steal her thirst. She had brought a folder with her that she didn\u2019t open, and it contained a letter she had written the night before to the nobody-you-write-to-when-you-don\u2019t-believe-in-church, in which she had recorded the first time she had said recalibrate out loud and watched a boy flinch. In that letter she had not apologized because apologies are easy if you give them the power to solve, and she had instead written, \u201cI am complicit in a hum,\u201d which was tastefully small and exactly true. She did not hand the letter to anyone; she kept it, and perhaps that is what made her valuable in the end\u2014her refusal to make her conscience public theater.\n\nThey had feared the theater of disruption the way you fear rain when you have planned an outdoor wedding, and there were contingency plans folded under clipboard clips and running in careful paths through Mara\u2019s brain. The disruption came a different way, by hand, and it almost undid the afternoon because someone had chosen a good actor. A man with a student\u2019s backpack and a pen behind his ear fell down near the water table with the kind of collapse you cannot pull off without rehearsal, and he said the word dizzy with the weight of another word behind it: drugged. Three heads turned the wrong direction because training often makes patterns where there is only performance, and then a steward was there and a marshal and Rafi and Leda, and between them they built a shape the hum had not accounted for: a circle that was not a crowd. They asked for consent to touch even as they stabilized a head and lifted a chin, and they asked for water, and they asked his name, and they asked whether there was anything in his pockets that would be embarrassed by being mentioned in public. He said \u201cEvan\u201d and then \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d and then \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d and Oona, who had spent a decade catching apologies she did not need because men fling them at bartenders like tips in coins, said, \u201cWe accept.\u201d The show deflated into a human, and the care tent staff looked at their clipboards and decided to visit the lemonade instead.\n\nThe maintenance company\u2014the real one, not the copycat with the magnets\u2014arrived with two technicians whose shoulders were ruined by ten years of vents and who carried a coil of cable that had seen wars no one wrote about. They had received a service ticket stamped by a department that had no business stamping tickets, and they presented it to Mara with the exact degree of hostility that reserved for those who make your job more dangerous but not more noble. \u201cSomebody says your boxes want to talk to them,\u201d the taller of the two said, pointing at the power points routed through a system that had learned to recognize being flirted with by a hum. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make sure nothing that thinks it\u2019s God gets a dial tone.\u201d Mara liked him immediately and gave him a vest in a color that bathed him in permission, and he moved through the junctions introducing the room to its own electricity one outlet at a time.\n\nBy late afternoon the festival had taught itself a rhythm independent of its founders, which is one of the proofs a ritual is worth keeping. There was a set of readings from House Rules aloud by people who had never been asked to read in public since school, and they discovered that their voices didn\u2019t shake when the sentences were not borrowed from law. Someone had made a song of the consent lines in three chords and bad harmonies, and now it was not bad, and a mother had brought a child and the child had a token tied to his wrist like a bracelet, and he lifted it and put it down as if playing at being sovereign without understanding the taste of the word. Ainsworth taught a boy named Niles to zest without gouging the pith, and the boy learned faster than men whose hands had been trained to hide, and there was a brief, unarguable miracle when Ezra signed, very slowly and very majestically, to a deaf man the gesture for enough, and the man looked at his token and laughed without sound and then with it.\n\nWhen dusk bled in and the bulbs had to choose their identities, the hum tried one last tone, polite as a relative who insists the party is over because their train leaves at nine. Kira felt it assemble itself in the third paragraph of a memo she had refused to send, and she did not indulge in melodrama by putting her hands over her ears. She turned her back on the care tent and faced the not-stage and spoke for the first time to the mechanism she served. \u201cWe decline,\u201d she said, and she made her mouth shape the words the way a body shapes a habit. \u201cWe will not normalize; we will localize. We will not extract; we will escort. We will not sanitize; we will wash our hands and then eat with them.\u201d The hum did not stop because a woman had given it a new lexicon, but it wavered, and in that half-second of indecision the bulbs steadied, and the city added a new category to the way it lists fundaments: air, water, rules, refusal.\n\nLater, when cleanup had softened the edges of the day the way wiping down a station after service removes only the mess that needs removing, they sat among the detritus of cups and paper rosemary and tokens scattered like coins that had done their job. Leda leaned against a folding table with the long patience of someone whose back understands the tradeoff between ambition and chairs, and she nudged Ainsworth\u2019s foot with hers the way you do when the conversation needs to arrive without announcement. \u201cYou looked less hungry today,\u201d she said, and it was neither praise nor criticism, just an inventory. He handed her the knife he had cleaned twice already and she blinked because old habits are forever; you do not hand a blade without offering the handle. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said, answering a question she had not asked because they had been married, after all, and some of that language does not burn. \u201cHe\u2019s going to try with me in daylight. In a room with no vents and a door with a knob on both sides.\u201d\n\nKira did not go home because home had started to look a little like a shrine to a god she could not entirely swear off without leaving a note. She went to Oona\u2019s bar because a person who has watched the day admit a better way needs to place herself in a room where the door says welcome in the only metaphor she likes. She sat at the end of the bar, and Oona did not pretend not to know her, and she did not stage a confrontation because chairs were immediately at hand. \u201cYou cannot keep your job forever,\u201d Oona said conversationally, rinsing a glass with enough attention to make it gleam in its best self. \u201cNot the one you have now, at least. Your language is going to run out of nouns.\u201d Kira shrugged with the shoulders of someone who can feel the straps of an occupation growing thin. \u201cYou make it look like the problem is rhetorics,\u201d she said, and Oona slid a glass across the wood whose bottom had been zested with lemon just enough to make the water smell like a decision. \u201cIt usually is,\u201d Oona said, and they drank like acquaintances not yet ready to admit to liking each other.\n\nThe night folded itself in careful thirds and was put away somewhere the city keeps next to the good tablecloths, and House Rules came down from the string to be packed and copied and reprinted and taped to cabinet doors in apartments where nothing else matches. Alessandro slept in the room that had learned how to be boring enough for a nervous system to trust it, and the white room came to him in a different mood, as if it had taken a walk and found a park, and said hold without the imperative. He did not answer because you do not reward small changes, you feed them, and his hands on the blanket made the shape of an embrace that had not yet met its object. On the table beside him the rosemary had put out the tiniest new tip because even cuttings will root if you give them a cup and ask them to stay, and the scent was the sort of thing a man could live with under his breath for a very long time without becoming pious.\n\nMorning walked in through the precinct with boots that had dried properly overnight and left no marks, and the day requested work in that large, amiable way festivals produce as a side effect. Ainsworth wore a shirt that had decided to be formal without becoming stiff, and he brought the lemon jar and two tokens and the notebook because props let you pretend the ritual is not in your body. Mara arranged herself on the other side of the glass with the gaze of a woman who will name what she sees if it goes wrong, and she did not clutch the pen because gripping hard makes ink lie. They did not invite an audience beyond the few already involved because this was not a show and would be ruined by anyone who arrived with adjectives ready. Alessandro asked the question as if he had not already been told yes, and Ainsworth said it as if the word had waited a long time to be used on his tongue for this purpose and was dropping weight like a well-timed pan.\n\nThe laugh did not arrive grand; it came as a correction, a small wrench turned gently until a thread caught and then the spin was inevitable. It arrived with heat that had learned not to apologize for itself in a body trained to be competent, and it lifted the place under the sternum where he keeps recipes and photographs and the polite refusal to cry in public, and it made room. Alessandro\u2019s hand didn\u2019t have to touch to do its reminder; it hovered the precise way a lid hovers when you are letting steam escape without wasting heat, and Ainsworth found that the tenderness did not undermine his authority so much as validate it to the part of him that takes notes. He pressed the token gently, as much to show Mara he remembered the rule as to stop, and in the stop there was the most important instruction House Rules had ever given: you may end a beautiful thing before it consumes you and the beauty will not be insulted.\n\nThey wrote together after, because the forest of language that had filled the room required pruning, and also because sweat that arrives for good reasons deserves ink. They wrote that in-house procedures for officers include laughter breaks, and they used the word include because require would make the ceremony vulgar. They wrote that any room used for interview or intimacy must learn to be dull, and they stapled that to the protocol about unplugging vents and naming noises, and they made a new line that read, curious in its own right, that no officer will stand between a person and their chosen steward, and that if a person cannot choose a steward the city will choose one that is not an institution and not a machine. Mara wrote it with the flinty grace of a woman who has been mistaken for a mechanism before and wishes to save others the choreography of having to correct people.\n\nIt was Kira who delivered the counter-brief that afternoon because if she was going to defect in any fashion it would be by telling truths in an office where truths are treated like pepper: useful when scattered, dangerous when dumped. She brought a bag with a lunch she intended to eat in an act of solidarity with her own body, and two documents that would get her fired if she used the wrong pronoun. \u201cThey will transition to consent mimicry,\u201d she said, sitting in the chair and ignoring its squeak because shame is a useless maintenance item. \u201cThey will send their own versions of you out, and they will use lemon and rosemary and tokens and the right posture, and they will ask at the right time with the right voice. They will not write, because writing can be captured, but they will draw, and their sprigs will be perfect. You know the trick for telling real from fake in art.\u201d Mara looked at the precise ends of Kira\u2019s hair and waited, because she has learned to let people enjoy telling their own conclusions. \u201cImperfection is not the measure,\u201d Kira said. \u201cLove is. You can see where the hand refuses to look away.\u201d\n\nThey decided at once to teach the city to tell the difference, and the method was the sort of plain that pleases Ainsworth far more than flourish. Oona made a batch of paper that took ink in a slow way, and a batch that took ink too easily, and she taught stewards to feel the drag at the first flourish of a rosemary needle. Rafi set up a table called Spot the Counterfeit Consent, and people laughed at the name and then turned serious when they saw how easily lines deceive, and Ezra learned to draw a sprig that was elegantly wrong on purpose and stuck it up by the sink at the Bluemme with a note that read, not this one. Alessandro watched with a professionalism that did not exclude pain, and he fixed his own hand in the open by putting the trick into words: \u201cYou will see breath in mine,\u201d he said to a young man who wanted to be him and didn\u2019t. \u201cA machine can copy struggle. It cannot copy relief.\u201d\n\nThe festival did not end so much as shift venues, as the city is fond of doing, and kitchens and bars and parks and dance studios all took a turn hosting the ritual of asking and stopping and writing it down. The care tents attempted an event of their own near the stadium and were attended briefly by a small number of journalists and one woman who wanted very much to be told she had done something wrong; they did not thrive. The truck with the ersatz logo passed through the neighborhood like a folklore animal in a fable nobody wanted to tell their children, and then it left without incident because everyone had learned to shout only at faces. On the forum, which had cleaned itself out more than once this month, someone coined the phrase houses of yes for places that had posted the rulebook beside their liquor license and their health score, and the tag filled with ordinary miracles: a photo of a token in a dentist\u2019s office; a screenshot of a course syllabus with consent and lemon written in the same line without apology; a shaky video of a police captain asking to be laughed for because he had a knot that would not yield any other way.\n\nIn the late hour, when dishes breed and the last trains tempt you to forgive yourself, Alessandro took the long way home with intention. He walked under a bridge that was not his because owning corners is a luxury he is careful not to let himself believe in, and he paused to press his ear to the stone because he has discovered the city will answer if you ask in a manner it recognizes. He heard the hum farther away than it has ever been, disgruntled not by defeat but by boredom, which is different and safer, and he promised himself a day soon where he would not be needed and could be idle without punishing the idleness by calling it recovery. When he climbed the stairs in his building the light in the hallway did not flicker, not once, and the relief that flooded his chest felt like a novice cook learning that turning the burner down does not mean you have failed ambition; it means you understand the physics.\n\nNear dawn, a message appeared from a teenager whose signature was three stars and a turtle. It said, \u201cI\u2019m new,\u201d and then, in the way the young collapse and expand within the same sentence, \u201cI want to laugh without it becoming content.\u201d House Rules had no chapter on that yet, which is how you know a book is alive. Ainsworth answered it with a recipe\u2014small on purpose, unglamorous on purpose, precise because kindness always is\u2014about finding someone to hold the door of consent with you and leaving your phone in a bowl with the keys and calling the act by its true name: private. He added a line in pencil to the end of the festival chapter when he returned the notebook to the table by the rosemary: we will celebrate without witnesses, when necessary. He underlined it once, not because it needed emphasis, but because the muscle for underlining had learned a new trick and wanted to try it in daylight.",
