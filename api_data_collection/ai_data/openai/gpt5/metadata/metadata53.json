     "novel_text": "On the night the fireworks came early and the summer heat made the storm drains breathe, I walked along Yonge Street with pebbles in my shoes and moth dust on my shoulders. The traffic lights blinked their human semaphore; the jack pines whispered in a language that is older than any suburb. The sign for the used bookshop clicked, its O intermittently alive, so that it was U SED B OKS and then U SED BO KS and, briefly, US EDBOOKS\u2014like a spell trying to remember itself.\n\nI am a fairy. Not the kind that rustles out of graveyard stones with a harp and a tragic smile. I\u2019m the kind that learned to put quarters in parking meters and hold a door open at the dentist\u2019s because the hygienist was clearly overloaded. My ring\u2014the circle that raised me, that I slip back into when the grass glows and the sounds of the highway soften\u2014is behind a backyard fence in Richmond Hill, looks like trampled clover, and if you step into it without knowing to ask, it will borrow your name until you are clever enough to ask it back.\n\nMy name is Tamsin Reed. There have been other names. The one the railway line calls me is Silver Current. The one the raccoons call me cannot be translated without scraping up the throat. The one that matters tonight is the one my landlord spells wrong on the buzzer: Tamson.\n\nHe did it on purpose\u2014another layer of misdirection; I don\u2019t mind.\n\nI came out because of a feeling. The air had a cindery taste, laughter had gone metallic at the edges. Somewhere, too near for comfort, a bad joke was growing teeth.\n\nHe always arrives like that: a prickle, as if the city\u2019s neon nervous system were about to sneeze. First the laughter, then the hush, then the laughter again but with a warpy, barbed hook in it. I followed the sound past the bakery that stays open too late, past the bus shelter that catches more rain than it keeps off, to the patio of The Finch, where the umbrellas are all branded with a beer named after a province I have never put my feet in.\n\nThe Finch is not named for him, but it might as well be. Brill Grackle leaned against the rail like someone who had invented leaning. He is a fairy like me, but as a violin is like a hacksaw. Slung in denim, slick-smiled, eyes the color of that oily puddle sheen that makes children go oh. He was telling a story, and his hands\u2014their gestures\u2014were dangerous.\n\nHe tells jokes. He tells the kind that trip minds. In the old days he whispered into the ears of kings and dukes and shirtless shepherds, harmless now, you'd think, in a town with a good library and a bus schedule that sometimes works. Except you can do damage with jokes. He knows where the seams are.\n\n\u201c\u2026and then she says\u2014\u201d Brill broke off because he saw me. His grin went knife-sharp and then softened into something like affection. \u201cTammy-Tam,\u201d he said, welcoming, warning.\n\n\u201cTamsin,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody asked for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they did,\u201d he said, spreading his hands at his audience: a chemistry teacher, a man with a briefcase who pretended not to be listening, a cluster of young men drunk on being young and cheap IPA. \u201cThey asked with their boredom. I\u2019m the answer to that, darling. And I brought new material.\u201d\n\nHe had new material every time. He never told the same joke twice; he never had to. He could look at a scar and build a punchline around it, a punchline that opened like a hinge into whatever the person didn\u2019t want to show. And tonight he was performing for the patio but also for me. He kept throwing me those sideways glances, those if-you\u2019re-so-good-come-stop-me looks.\n\nI could have. I have a knack that isn\u2019t fair; it isn\u2019t anything. It\u2019s just what I am: I can turn anybody into a kitten.\n\nI have turned a judge into a kitten once, for twenty-seven minutes; he was heavenly soft and so very small, and he purred in a frequency that I still hear when I am too tired to sleep. I turned a bus driver into a kitten when he was about to punch another bus driver for calling his mother a rude noun; they both wrestled gently on the seat while I drove their route, which yes, was excessive, but no one got hurt, and the passengers were very patient when I missed Steeles and had to double back. I turned my landlord into a kitten for exactly one breath when he said I was a month late on rent and I wasn\u2019t. He apologized for the error and we pretended not to notice the yellow fur on his shoulder.\n\nI could have turned Brill into a kitten. I didn\u2019t, because he would not have stayed kitten-shaped; he would have clawed his way out of the spell and also because I am not supposed to use that on our own kind. There is Law. It is slippery and moss-edged, but it is real, and I keep it when I can.\n\nHe started again. His voice is a good voice, I\u2019ll give him that. He spoke softly so people leaned in. The punchline came like a goose walking on ice. There was laughter, that was laughter, then there were faces turning into gates\u2014open, too open, nothing behind the eyes. He had pushed the joke too far and they had followed him. He went further. The joke got... worse. Not violent. Not illegal. Not something I\u2019ll repeat.\n\nA girl in a red shirt put her hand over her mouth and was laughing and crying at the same time. The chemistry teacher\u2019s cheeks burned. Someone dropped a glass. Brill\u2019s teeth flashed.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cTamsin,\u201d he crooned, not looking at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be dull.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand why you don\u2019t talk to our aunties anymore,\u201d I said. \u201cBut do you understand how thin this is? The skin between world and hey-whoops? Stop it.\u201d\n\nHe tapped the rail with his knuckles, tat-tat-tat, and told one more line. His laughter found the bit of you that thinks you are a worse person than you present and pressed on it. People laughed as if they were apologizing to the air.\n\nThe girl in red stood. Her chair scraped. One of the beer-blooming young men reached to tug the edge of her shirt like he didn\u2019t have a mother. I sighed. I felt the familiar rush in my fingers.\n\nKitten.\n\nThe young man blinked. His hands were suddenly soft-padded, his expression a perfect small question. He sat. His friends made seals of themselves, flapping and hooting. The girl stared, then scooped him\u2014no, him, not a cat, never a cat entirely\u2014into her arms by instinct and said what you say to a sudden kitten: \u201cOh my God.\u201d She stroked behind his ears. He went boneless with simple bliss, the joke dropping out of him like a nail from rotten wood.\n\n\u201cDirty pool,\u201d Brill murmured. \u201cYou always did prefer soft answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always did like hard ones,\u201d I said. I walked onto the patio and without touching anyone touched their attention. \u201cHey,\u201d I said, lightly. \u201cThis is a funny fairy, he tells jokes, but he sometimes forgets to bring consent to the table. Laugh if you want to. Don\u2019t if you don\u2019t. This is me pressing the reset button. Ha-ha.\u201d\n\nThe air wobbled and bumped back into alignment. Someone coughed. The man with the briefcase stared at me and then at the kitten, which I was not going to let remain a kitten for more than a minute because there\u2019s an ethical calculus to this that I am not terrible at. Still, I did my terrible little trick again. Softened him. Kittened a second boy who was winding up to say something you can\u2019t say. He shrank; his anger shrank with him.\n\nBrill\u2019s smile did a slow handstand, then righted itself. \u201cOh, Tamson,\u201d he said, deliberately, a needle in it. \u201cFrom the Hill. Loves her little cats. Does tricks. Fetches slippers and brings them to the party.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t a joke, really. That was a brute fact disguised as insult. I have always lived here, or always enough. The old rings knew me; the new restaurants did, too. I was one of those fairies that stayed when the others bored themselves back into lakes and cigarette smoke. It gives a person a reputation.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d I told him, and felt the brushing, like crows feathering over my scalp, of other eyes. Our aunties look at us when we do things. Our uncles don't look but listen. There are not so many of us that we can afford to ignore each other.\n\nHe took a breath. He could have dug in\u2014turned mean, turned nasty, turned the whole patio into a chorus of sheepish cruelty. He didn\u2019t. He tipped two fingers like a hat. \u201cLater,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll wish you\u2019d come to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlikely,\u201d I said.\n\nHe hopped the railing like gravity was a suggestion and strolled north into slick blue. The sound of his footfalls was like someone synching a metronome to your heartbeat and then wobbling it off.\n\nThe young men turned back at the same time to being men. One\u2014kitten number one\u2014scruffed the back of his neck, bleated a laugh, tried for embarrassment like it was a jacket he hadn\u2019t worn in a while. \u201cWhat was that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou were rude,\u201d the girl in red said, excellent, crisp. She fixed him with a look that someday will level buildings. \u201cShe saved you from being worse. Say thank you.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me. \u201cThanks,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSorry, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s summer. The moon makes fools of everybody.\u201d I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, but it sounded right. I paid the bar back for the broken glass, which was a coin each to the two students washing dishes in the back, because it isn\u2019t the same as paying, but it covers some things money can\u2019t.\n\nWhen I step back out onto the sidewalk, the world resumed its rich, complicated hum. A bus coughed. A bicycle whispered past like a long-limbed insect, bells half-hearted as a yawn. Someone\u2019s radio played a song from before I was born that I know the chords to\u2014because there are only so many chords and we arrange them in endless ways.\n\nLayla was waiting under the birch just beyond the sushi place. She raised both eyebrows at me, and her shoulders read: So? and Well? Layla knows my business. She is human with a capital H and a minor in Secrets. I met her when she was fourteen and talked to the squirrels because her house was noisy with other people\u2019s arguments; she is twenty-seven now and runs the children\u2019s section at the library as if it were a frontier post in a war against blandness.\n\n\u201cYou care too much,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t unkind.\n\n\u201cI care as much as it takes,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI figured,\u201d she said. \u201cA kid came in earlier and tried to check out a book we don\u2019t carry by making a joke. It kind of worked? I found a copy of it in the storage closet. Not normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cClever boy,\u201d I said. Brill can make desire heavy enough to pull things into your hands. Not conjuring, exactly, just a sleight that shimmies the shelves. \u201cDon\u2019t let him work the early readers into learning rude words.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, a quick glint. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said. She put her hand on my sleeve. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m annoyed,\u201d I said. \u201cHe keeps coming closer. Like he\u2019s testing the fence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no fence,\u201d Layla said. \u201cNot for him.\u201d\n\nFair. He had never respected lines. But there are other kinds of fences. Geography. Ritual. The rhythms that become familiar and guard as much as they bind. Richmond Hill is something like a lullaby to me: the way the sky opens over the plazas, the water hum from Mill Pond, the chatter around the soccer fields where the kids are better than they think. All of that is a net that keeps me from falling.\n\nWe walked south together. Layla\u2019s keychain chimed. The sky was a heat-bruise. \u201cHe\u2019s planning something,\u201d I said. \u201cI can feel it the way you can feel that the streetlights are about to buzz on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMidsummer,\u201d I said. \u201cAt the parade, probably.\u201d\n\nShe made a face. \u201cThat\u2019s three nights away. Will he wait?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll pretend to,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019ll poke between now and then to see where it itches.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cSo shampoo the city?\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d\n\nWe walked. The world felt tipped, like a cup about to spill. Somewhere a spoon fell. The wind had fallen asleep and the maples were waiting for the night to comb their hair.\n\nI took Layla home. Her apartment above the tailor smells like wool steam and old books. On her fridge, magnets shaped like punctuation marks are arranged so that it reads, by accident or design: ! ! ? and I approve. She put on a kettle and I sat in her chair by the window and listened to the building talk to itself through the pipes.\n\n\u201cYou could ask the aunties to help,\u201d she said at last.\n\n\u201cAnd what would they say?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be personal,\u201d she said. \u201cAsk. They might say yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey might take over,\u201d I said. \u201cThey might say stop being kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cKindness isn\u2019t your weakness,\u201d she said, gently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a habit, though,\u201d I said. \u201cHabits and weaknesses look the same at a distance.\u201d\n\nWe drank tea. We told each other gently ridiculous stories from the day\u2014two kids pretending the stacks were caves, Mr. Li the retired astronomer holding court at the park bench describing comet tails as if he had combed them himself, the family at the bus stop speaking three languages and laughing in a fourth. The small, steady good things are a kind of magic that doesn\u2019t show up in any of our books. But they build the floor you fight on.\n\nAfter midnight I went home. The mosquitoes wanted me, but I am inedible when I\u2019m annoyed. My building is brick that thinks it's a tree: it picks up squirrels and keeps them, it drops leaves in the hallways sometimes. On the second landing my landlord\u2019s cat, who is not my doing, eyed me with deep suspicion for reasons of her own. My door stuck in the summer. I sang it open.\n\nInside, my apartment exhaled, same as me. There is a rug. There are the old postcards I send myself when I leave and return every time, to make coming and going a game rather than an ache. There is the shelf that holds the whisker key.\n\nThe whisker key is exactly what it sounds like: a key, made of six whiskers braided, lacquered with something that is not sap and not resin, handles a little cold, teeth sharp as noon. It opens things that are too stubborn for any other tool. I once saw it open the idea of a door. The aunties gifted it to me when I bound my trick, when I declared what I was, when I became\u2014reluctantly and maybe forever\u2014The One With The Kittens. It was important to have a tool that wasn\u2019t one trick only. They have their moods, those aunties. Sometimes they hand you a skein of shadow and say here, knit. Sometimes they hand you a whisker key and it saves your life.\n\nI took it down and held it. It hummed like a tuning fork. It was either ready or simply alive. I put it in my bag.\n\nI also packed: three chalks (white, coral, and twilight), a loop of copper wire, the length of thread I had pulled from my own dress when I saved a boy in winter from turning himself into a story, two pennies, a piece of frit glass from a church window, a bow I did not know how to use (hopeful, I guess), and a cat toy shaped like a sardine that some part of me considered a talisman. I left the houseplants a note: Back soon. Water yourselves judiciously. \u2013T.\n\nSleep would not come. I listened to the slow tick of someone else\u2019s clock through a wall. I thought of Brill\u2019s voice cutting into rooms and making them laugh despite themselves. He calls that freedom. He is wrong, but he believes it, and that makes him fearless. I thought of all the ways a joke works like a spell and all the ways it doesn\u2019t. A joke, it turns out, is a ladder: you climb it and then throw it away. He builds ladders over places we have put a lot of effort into not falling.\n\nWhen dawn came on a moth wing, I put my face in the frost of the freezer and breathed in cold air until my thoughts stopped shimmering. Then I went to see Auntie Bellflower.\n\nYou find Auntie Bellflower by not looking for her. The backyard is a backyard, the fence a fence. The mulberry tree leans, and there is a swing, and there is a patch of wrong clover that makes the light taste sweet. You knock on the fence twice, then twice again, then once. The fence opens an eye. If it likes you, it winks. If it doesn\u2019t, it tells you a story and you forget your name for an hour. I am liked, which is not the same thing as being welcome, but suffices.\n\nInside the ring, everything is taller. The grass reaches my knees. The dandelions exchange straws. The wind speaks with etiquette. Auntie Bellflower sat on a mushroom that had never known a boot, plucking a harp made of minute bones. Her hair was the color of words you aren\u2019t supposed to say to your grandmother. She looked up.\n\n\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Tamsin,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Richmond Hill\u2019s civil servant without a salary.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that as if it were a profession,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to call it being harmless. We used to call it doing no harm. We used to be worse at it than you are.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cYou smell like engine noise and bad timing. What did he do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told jokes,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s his only trick and his sharpest spear. Your trick is softer but it leaves marks too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI make choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always did,\u201d she said. She put the harp down on her lap. \u201cBrill is playing with you. It is not that he doesn\u2019t have other projects; he always has other. But you are a string he can pluck and get a note that pleases him. You two have this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not a we,\u201d I said too fast.\n\n\u201cYou are an opposition,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a kind of we.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to use Midsummer,\u201d I said. \u201cHe wants a spectacle. He\u2019ll take the parade and stretch it until it breaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will try to sing shame into chorus,\u201d Auntie Bellflower said. \u201cHe is very good at it. He always has been.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t stop me. Just help me a little.\u201d\n\nShe looked past me into the ring\u2019s brighter place, the place with the whistlelines and spider-cranes raising webs like bridges. \u201cI have so many nieces and nephews,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think I can make choices for all of you? I am not a manager, Tamsin. I am not a god.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re better than both,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd anyway, you love me best.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, a slanting sound that tasted of honey and burnt sugar, which is to say complicated. \u201cBring your whisker key,\u201d she said. \u201cBring your copper and your chalk. Bring a mirror you can see yourself in even when you\u2019re not looking, and a bowl of milk.\u201d\n\n\u201cMilk,\u201d I said. \u201cAuntie, that is a clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d she said, all gravity. \u201cYou always get stuck on the parts of the old stuff that are silly. Sometimes the silly parts are the bones. Milk. Enough for a kitten, you understand? There will be one. Maybe a thousand. Who can say.\u201d\n\nI hated her for being right and being vague. \u201cAnd a mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cHold a joke in front of a mirror and watch it flinch,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will hate that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll break it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen he\u2019ll get seven years of some kind of trouble,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cIt has to be that way for someone. Better for him than for you.\u201d\n\nThe sun moved in a way suns do not for humans and I stood, my legs full of pins and needles because time here prickles. \u201cWill you stand with me?\u201d I asked, too quickly. Too small.\n\nShe looked at me with the soft part of her eyes, the side that sometimes still remembers my baby face and the way I would stare at the ceiling fan and clap as if it were a clock. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot. I shouldn\u2019t. This is your fight. It is your patch. He chose your stage.\u201d\n\nI nodded. I left the ring, which closed behind me like a mouth over a peach. The mulberry leaves said some very inappropriate things to me as I went; I pretended not to hear.\n\nThe city was happening. It always is. Moms carted strollers as if they were little ships in high wind. The joggers did their self-flagellating thing. The dog people met the other dog people, telegraphing complicated messages with leash hand gestures and scoops. I went to Mr. Li\u2019s and told him his tomatoes were about to be ambushed by hornworms and told the hornworms to try the basil instead, and then I felt him. Again, already.\n\nThis time he had found the schoolyard where the fence is missing three slats and the shade sits at the perfect angle for the bench. He had a small crowd: two teens with shaved kewpie curls, a woman who wore her grief like a jaguar on a leash, the man who sells phone plans in the kiosk and sells jokes if you press him. Brill balanced on the top rail of the fence, examining his nails, and every so often he spoke and the crowd rippled.\n\n\u201cBrill,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cTamsin,\u201d he said, bored. \u201cI am trying quieter material. Intimate stuff.\u201d He stretched his legs as if to show that he could, and wasn\u2019t that a wonder.\n\n\u201cWhisper it into your coat,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t own silence,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one does.\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence is rented like everything else,\u201d I said. \u201cYou pay for it with attention. And you, sir, never pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere would you like me to begin? The list of my vices? The case for my defense?\u201d He hopped down. \u201cYou muzzled me last night. That wasn\u2019t bad. The boys purring on their friends\u2019 laps. Good television. But I have to say\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, because what came next would be lewd and it would hurt someone who didn\u2019t come here to be hurt. He said it anyway. A clean, brutal line. The woman with the jaguar-grief laughed, then bit her tongue so hard I think it bled. Brill watched her as if she were an experiment.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d I said, again.\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d he said, wide-eyed. \u201cIt is always that with you. Enough. As if the world had an ideal gentle median where people keep hands to themselves and their thoughts sifted like flour and their mouths sweet with the little lies that keep an afternoon from tearing. I love you for it. I do. It\u2019s not for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to be like me,\u201d I said. \u201cI need you to not pull people into your current without a lifejacket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a lifejacket,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I pull them out of waters you don\u2019t see. They find out things and laugh until they get air back. That\u2019s what a joke is. That\u2019s what I am.\u201d\n\nI reached and drew a line with chalk between his shoes. \u201cHere,\u201d I said. \u201cPerform this way. Away from them.\u201d\n\nHe looked down at the chalk line and then looked up, and I realized he had wanted me to make a move that would let him move more. He stepped back deliberately over my line and told a small story about a busker, a cop, and a bouquet of gerberas, and the story clicked with the exact wrong part of the woman with jaguar-grief. She went still. Not calm. Not ready. Still like a mouse when the shadow passes overhead.\n\nI sighed that sigh. Even my sighs have muscle memory. Kitten. He\u2019d picked his audience well; there were no men itching for an excuse to be kittens. The two teens shrank and softened and looked surprised at their tails; the woman tipped her head at me, not a kitten, not even close. Not everyone can be, thank the greens. She looked at me as if a rope had loosened around her shoulders exactly one notch, and then she looked at Brill as if he were a bruise she would not be pressing again soon.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said to him. \u201cMidsummer is coming. Don\u2019t make me fight you with an entire town watching.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you wouldn\u2019t love it,\u201d he said, and that is the part where he was wrong. I like a private victory. I like quiet. I like the feeling of being the human variation while the loud things shake out their noise elsewhere. \u201cBring your milk and your mirror,\u201d he said, and this time it was like he\u2019d been listening to the fences, too. He knows almost everything that isn't his.\n\n\u201cYou first,\u201d I said.\n\nHe tipped his head at the teens, who were batting a bee back and forth with very round paws and tiny, murderous intent. He tipped his head at me. He tipped off the fence again and went, a breeze with a knife taped under its coat.\n\nLayla texted: Meeting in 20? I wrote back: Soon. Be careful.\n\nI brought milk home. Not for me. I am not that kind of fairy, not anymore. It is a ritual. Objects ask to be used the way they are meant to be; deny them that and you make a tangle. I poured the milk into a bowl so white it seemed to erase the counter under it, put the mirror on the kitchen table, a hand mirror with a fox engraved on the back that I stole and then paid for and then was permitted to keep by a woman who sees very clearly.\n\nI practiced. You can practice being terse; you can practice not explaining yourself beyond the point that affects the work. I drew circles with chalk on paper so I could throw the paper away, not litter the world with circles that might become doors. I set the whisker key down in a patch of sun so it would purr. I spoke the words that were not words at all: the rising humming vowels of Please and Now and You Stop, the clipped consonants of No More.\n\nI thought of kittens, their simple complete needs, their huge ridiculous paws. I thought of what I could do to Brill that wasn\u2019t cruel. I thought of what it would be to turn him kitten-soft, just for a second, to give him the feeling of being cherished without edges, and whether that would teach him what he refuses to learn. He would claw out at once. He would hate me. He would be himself again, sharper for the sanding.\n\nIt got hot. The whole town steamed. People who owned air conditioning blessed their ancestors; the rest of us perspired modestly or immodestly and let the night come.\n\nIt came scented with barbecue and grass, the far-off ring of a baseball bat, laughter that did not claw. I went to the pond and the fishermen who fish for stories nodded like we shared a route. Mr. Li waved me over and handed me an ice. \u201cThe moon is late,\u201d he said, as if that were up to it. \u201cI think it\u2019s trying another route.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell it to take Bathurst,\u201d I said. \u201cLess construction.\u201d\n\nWe sat. The frogs tuned up. Between and under everything was a vibration like a joke waiting to happen, like a curtain waiting to go up. I do not love that feeling. It asks and asks. It is a mouth.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Mr. Li said, and I told him the true part: that a fairy was bothering people in public, and that I was going to stop him in public. He nodded, like a man acknowledging a chess opening he\u2019d seen before. \u201cBring witnesses,\u201d he said. \u201cBring someone to laugh at the right place. It matters where laughter falls.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring Layla. She knows the beats. She knows how to not feed him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can also,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI can try,\u201d I said.\n\nWe made arrangements without calling them that. The whole world is made of arrangements. You can walk through them like spiderwebs and pretend they aren\u2019t there, but then your cheek stings and your hands get sticky.\n\nTwo days. The parade swelled in the winter plans and sprang up in summer wood and cloth. Kids decorated wagons and then reluctantly let adults help. A brass band that was mostly broken but had three trumpets showed up. Paper lanterns hung careful as croissants. Layla built a booth with a sign that read: Read Out Loud and raised a stack of stories as if they were sandbags. I chalked invisible lines here and there that would slow things if they had to slow, and built a net you wouldn\u2019t notice, made of Yes You May and Please Step Aside and No Not You. The whisker key hummed in my pocket where I tucked it like a secret.\n\nBrill sent messengers, as if we were in a play. A crow dropped a strip of paper that read: don\u2019t wear yellow. A squirrel told me a filthy riddle that I will not repeat and got a cherry for his trouble. A cloud shaped like a mouth drizzled on me when I stood at the corner of Major Mackenzie and Yonge and three kids laughed and I laughed back, because weather has its own comedy.\n\nOn the morning of the thing, I rose early and fed the idea of courage with toast. I wore shoes I could run in. I left a note for the houseplants that said: forgive me. I tucked the mirror into its scarf and made the milk new and cold. I texted Layla: please be early, please bring your voice.\n\nAt the park, the day opened like a folding chair. People who had only ever been alone in their kitchens stood shoulder to shoulder and discovered they were friends. Auntie Bellflower didn\u2019t come, because she said she wouldn\u2019t, but there were others from the rings, disguised as the woman who sells kettle corn, as the old man napping under a hat, as the kid with a skateboarding T-shirt who never blinked. They were there because we are nosy. Also because we pretend not to be a community but we are. Also because our aunties do not do nothing; even when they do nothing they do it beautifully and with careful omissions.\n\nBrill came late. He came like the last course of a meal you\u2019re already full from but smell and think: oh, fine. He wore white, to spite the don\u2019t wear yellow note, and his shirt had a stain on it shaped like a map of a country that needed better water management. He didn\u2019t take a stage. He found an absence\u2014between the band and the bouncy castle, at the open lip of the pond\u2014and stepped into it as if he had paid for it.\n\nPeople noticed the way grass notices feet. This is how it happens when he is strong: no horns, no spotlight. Attention tips toward him like it has been waiting to pour. He didn\u2019t say his name. He didn\u2019t ask us to gather round. He told a small, precise story about a dad who lost his temper and then apologized, and because he could not be patient he laced it with a barb and everyone felt the barb and laughed to prove it didn\u2019t stick. It did. It always does. He went on.\n\nI didn\u2019t jump. I waited. I let him build his little rope bridge across the gorge. The thing with jokes is that they are navigation; they end where they mean to end. You must let them take you there. When he had brought the room\u2014field, pond, strollers, brass\u2014up to a simmer, when he had turned everyone into one animal with one breath, I stepped.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said, not loudly. I poured the milk into the white bowl that belonged to my grandmother. The air discharged like a storm thinking better of itself. Brill\u2019s eyes flicked to the bowl and then to the mirror and then to me. I had a moment to enjoy that.\n\n\u201cKitty Queen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBard of Bad Timing,\u201d I said back, and saw several heads tilt at the word Bard like oh lovely.\n\nHe smiled. \u201cYou brought props.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always do,\u201d I said, and gestured at his mouth.\n\nPeople found that funny. He did not.\n\n\u201cThis is my town,\u201d I said\u2014to him and to everyone else. \u201cYou\u2019re a guest here if you\u2019re here at all. That means I get the right of reply. That means you do not get to say whatever you want and then pretend that \u2018just joking\u2019 is a spell that bleaches consequences. That means I will take your joke, and I will turn it around, and we will see what bites.\u201d\n\nHe swayed. \u201cYou can\u2019t reverse a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cYou break it if you try. It isn\u2019t a mirror. It\u2019s an arrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a boomerang,\u201d I said, and held up the mirror so it caught him, so for one split second he saw his own shape about to speak. He flinched. He smiled as if that were part of the routine. He tried to talk into the mirror. His voice skipped. The edge fell off the syllables like a knife losing its serration. He tried again.\n\n\u201cOnce,\u201d he began, and I heard the shift in the crowd: the hunger to hear the story, the hope it would be nice and the resilience if it was not. I placed the mirror against my chest and leaned it so that it showed the bowl of milk and then Brill\u2019s eyes. I took the whisker key out and set it delicately on the edge of the bowl. The sound it made was not a sound but everyone heard it in their teeth.\n\nHe blinked. \u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d he said, as if we had been sitting together with cups of tea and not knotted in a game that would call itself war if it had more honor.\n\n\u201cInterrupting,\u201d I said. \u201cPolitely.\u201d\n\n\u201cRude,\u201d he said, delighted, and then his delight hooked itself into the wrong angle because I let myself smile too. That cracked something between us. He saw what I would do and couldn\u2019t help wanting to see it done.\n\n\u201cSay it,\u201d I invited.\n\nHe said it. He said the first of his Midsummer lines, a tidy, cruel joke disguised as a kindness, with a parent at the center and a child at the edge and the sharp delight of doing wrong because someone says it\u2019s right. As the words left his mouth I put my hand between them and him and turned my hand once, twice, as if unscrewing a lid from a jar. I heard it. You hear it when I do it: a mew as clear as a bell.\n\nHis voice fell soft and small. It didn\u2019t stop being his voice, it just became gentle. He put his hand to his mouth, startled, and snatched it away as if he\u2019d been caught doing something private. He glared at me. He loved me for a heartbeat. Hated me for three.\n\n\u201cYou like humiliation,\u201d he said, too low for anyone else.\n\n\u201cI like the truth with claws out,\u201d I said. \u201cYours is not the only version.\u201d\n\nHe tried again. He reached for a deeper cut. He began a story about a woman who wanted the wrong things. I held the mirror up so he had to look at himself as he said it. I didn\u2019t make him a kitten because he would have broken my spell out of pure spite and bloodied himself on the edges. I did what Auntie said: I held the joke up to itself and watched it flinch.\n\nHe sneered, just a little. He stretched his nice mouth around the line that would have made twenty people here vulnerable, and he could not finish it. He huffed a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d I said. \u201cAsk around. I\u2019m the best fun.\u201d I let the crowd laugh and some of them did, a real good laugh, not the kind he sells. Layla\u2019s laugh, especially, rang pure, the laugh of someone who understands the structure of things and likes them anyway. Mr. Li put his hand over his heart and coughed, which is what he does when he places a check where he wants a checkmate to be.\n\nBrill took one step back. One step forward. Pleasure ran across his face and left it like someone wiping crumbs off a plate. \u201cWe could do this forever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t,\u201d and I pushed. Not him. The world.\n\nThere are lines you can draw between breaths. There are circles you can make around laughter. There are nets you can cast that catch intention instead of fish. I had laid them all this morning because I had seen how he moves, and I set one gently under him now, and when he tried for his next joke, he slipped and fell through to the floor of himself.\n\nIt was a soft fall. I am not cruel. He stood in the bowl of milk up to his ankles and hissed like a displeased cat and realized he was not going to die from that feeling. The crowd made a sound that people make when they see a magician mess up in a way that turns out to be the real trick, the benevolent inside-out of a show-off\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cCome away,\u201d I said, to him. \u201cCome away with me and try kindness. Just once. Just to see if it\u2019s the kind of chemical that changes you.\u201d\n\nHe looked more dangerous at that invitation than he had all morning. He looked at my hand as if it were a snake that wanted to share its venom. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou might,\u201d I said.\n\nHe looked at the milk and sneered and stepped out, pristine. The milk had not so much as spattered his hem. He is good at not being touched. He is better at leaving you without noticing. He turned to the crowd and bowed. \u201cYou have been magnificent,\u201d he said, and the sleaziest part of the day was that he meant it. \u201cTip your servers,\u201d he added, and pointed at me.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201ctip the band,\u201d and the whole line of brass laughed and took off at a tempo that broke the spell in ten strides. The strollers went back to being wheels and naps. The pond fish resumed their small politics. Layla stepped into Brill\u2019s path and handed him a book.\n\n\u201cFor you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a very funny ending.\u201d\n\nHe took it. He is not stupid. He knows a curse when he smells one. He knows a gift that tastes the same as obligation. He tucked it under his arm and offered her a line that would have turned her eyebrows to frost; she stared him down and he let it fall. He melted away, the way he does, the way a joke does when it\u2019s told in the wrong room.\n\nI picked up the whisker key and the mirror and the bowl, and my hands were shaking just enough that I wanted to be a kitten\u2014small, unaccountable, loved for making mischief in a way that breaks nothing. But I am Tamsin. I am supposed to walk home now, and I did, with Layla on my left and Mr. Li behind me measuring the length of a treeline with his hands because he was excited and he has his ways of saying so.\n\nWe didn\u2019t win; not like that. You never do, against a creature like Brill, not fully and not forever. But there was a dent in him. A bruise where his joke had hit the mirror and bounced back. There was milk drying in the grass like an offering. There was the knowledge that laughter could be placed. It mattered where it fell. It mattered when we stepped in.\n\nAt my door, the key did the thing it does, turning the lock and also the words around it so that my name was safe inside. I set the mirror down and it reflected a ceiling that isn\u2019t mine but is, and the bowl in the sink had a ring around it at the exact height of Brill\u2019s ankles and somehow that pleased me like a recipe that came out edible when it shouldn\u2019t have. The houseplants forgave me with great dignity. I left the whisker key on the windowsill where the light could lick it, and I sat down to write a note to Auntie that said: I did it, kind of. Thank you. And also: he is not finished.\n\nThe night asked for my hands and I gave them. The night asked for my voice and I told it yes and no and maybe in a pattern that is a kind of music. I slept. I dreamed of kittens, but also of foxes, and of white bowls that held everything I am willing to hold. In the morning, the radio said it might rain later. I said good. Let it. Let the whole town wash its face. Let us start again and again, every time.The rain came like a forgiveness it hadn\u2019t entirely earned, first a spit, then a sifting, then a proper wash. It took the skins off heat and laid them over the storm drains, which breathed like sleeping animals and then like bellows when the gutters filled. The city drank. The jack pines steamed. The sidewalks re-summarized themselves as if they were rewriting an essay they\u2019d already handed in and gotten back with too many red marks. I walked without a destination because destinations feel like claims, and I was not ready to claim anything but already had too much to guard.\n\nWhen a town washes its face, names rise like soap bubbles, and some of them pop. The used bookshop sign blinked in a sequence that made a different word altogether\u2014U SED OB KS\u2014like it had lost its breath laughing. A bus rolled past with the route panel saying OOPS because the rain had got to whatever innards made its letters, and five passengers smiled at the delirium and five scowled and one took a picture because that\u2019s what we do when something lifts out of regular. The picture was already halfway around several phones by the time the bus took a corner, and if you think magic doesn\u2019t use Wi-Fi when it can, you haven\u2019t been paying attention.\n\nLayla texted a series of rain emojis and also a soup bowl, which I chose to interpret as a call for pho. I told her I\u2019d meet her later, after I had done my rounds, which is not a thing anyone told me to do but that I chose to do until it became a kind of job. I checked the park and the pond and the back of the bakery where the rats are elegant as thieves. I loosened a knot on a swing. I tightened a knot in a kid\u2019s sneaker and made sure he thought he had done it himself. I looked at the fence with the three missing slats and put my face against the damp wood. The world on the other side smelled like mint crushed underfoot and something a little bitter, the kind of bitter that makes medicine work.\n\nIf Brill had left a trap, it would be in the laughter, so I listened to laughter. There was the laugh of the man who got splashed by a taxi and pretended to be a saint about it. There was the unsuppressed cackle of the teenager who stepped in the puddle on purpose because he wanted to feel like a child. There was the shy ripple of two people who had not known whether to go on a first date and had decided, fine, if the world is this wet, let\u2019s swim. None of those were his. His laughter passed through people like a current, leaving them bright and scraped. The aftertaste wasn\u2019t here. He had gone to ground or gone online, which in our age is the same thing with a different drainage system.\n\nI stopped at the library because it is Layla\u2019s church and my favorite kind of fortress. The children\u2019s section sounded like it was radiating during a power surge, little voices pitched to a hum that interfered with the air. Layla stood behind her desk and gave me a look that was ninety percent knowing and ten percent I didn\u2019t sleep enough. There were paper cranes on the string above her that had been birds in other hands and were now metastories. She jerked her chin toward the back room.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the catalog, somehow,\u201d she said, when the door closed and the smell of crayons took over from old glue. \u201cI mean, not him-him. But he has a trick in there. Do you know the thing where you type three letters and it suggests a book you were embarrassed to check out last year because your ex gave it to you and you don\u2019t want to admit you liked it? It\u2019s that but worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe taught the library to remember what you thought you were over,\u201d I said, and only then realized my nails were in my palms as if I could hold onto other people\u2019s privacy for them through my skin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s adds-you-into-baskets energy,\u201d Layla said. \u201cLike you\u2019re at the grocery and the cart sees what your neighbor is buying and decides you must want it too. It\u2019s subtle. It\u2019s sticky. I\u2019m trying to not throw the server in the bathtub.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that as if you haven\u2019t already done it in your mind,\u201d I said, and she grinned briefly because she had, and because my guessing made her feel read and liked.\n\n\u201cI can scrub it, probably,\u201d she said. \u201cOr teach the system to laugh at him. That sometimes works. If a computer can pretend to be bored with a demon, the demon loses interest. They like vanity mirrors, not matte finishes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach it to be matte,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk the stacks.\u201d\n\nIf you think walking stacks is nothing, you have never thought about spines whispering to each other about the hands that touched them. I followed a thread of not-funny into the 398s and then into the row where how-to manuals stand shoulder to shoulder with open secrets. A lime green tutorial on home repairs was emitting jokes about fathers that had never even tried to fix a leaky faucet, and my temper blipped so hard it sent a small flock of calm out to graze. I put my hand on the shelf and told it a story about the man I had watched at the park who fixed a stranger\u2019s rolled stroller wheel and then cried into his sleeve because that was the last thing he had done for his daughter before she told him she was moving out, and laughter rose in the shelf like yeast, gentle and true. The mean line dissolved. I knew then where Brill had slipped in: in the place where we categorize human error and teach ourselves not to be tender about it.\n\nAt the circulation desk a woman returned a book with an apologetic smile that had a rictus built into it, and we all felt Brill\u2019s finger under the corners of her mouth. \u201cOverdue,\u201d she said, and the word bristled, and Layla stepped forward like a conductor bringing in a string section and said, \u201cNo worries,\u201d which is a phrase that I mistrust when it comes too easy, but she said it in a way that meant: I see you. It worked. The word overdue became about a book and not about a moral failing, and we moved on.\n\nWhen I left the library the rain was thinking about stopping, which for rain is a complicated thought. It draped itself over the air and inspected its own drips like a seamstress checking a hem. My whisker key vibrated in my bag with the precise irritation of a small creature whose needs were not being met quickly enough. I took it out and held it, and the damp made it sound a little higher, like a violin someone had tuned for a smaller room. The key has interests. It finds doors, not just in walls but in people. It wants me to be brave and clever and also remembered, and it sulks when I am any of those without its help.\n\nThe first kitten found me at the corner of a puddle that thought it was a pond. It was not a conjuration. It was one of the city\u2019s cats, half feral, all self, with a notch in its ear and eyes the shade of glass that becomes ocean when you love it too much. It looked at me as if it thought I had something to do with the weather, which is nice to be accused of on a morning like this. It sniffed at the cuff of my jeans and then at the key and then made the sound that in my head is the word Well?, which I have been told is an error, but I am allowed some. I put a finger under its chin and it agreed to be admired. We stood there in a miniature truce until an umbrella swished by and the cat went wherever cat business takes you when you don\u2019t have pockets.\n\nThe ring behind the fence in Richmond Hill had swollen during the night. You could tell by the way the grass around it leaned in, and by the way the wrong clover looked righteous, and by the way the fence had a new eye that refused to wink. Auntie Bellflower wasn\u2019t there. The air had the taste of someone else\u2019s song. An uncle, then. They come when they think duty needs a cane.\n\nHe was sprawled on a log as if exhaustion were a mantle he had earned the right to wear, and he looked like the kind of man you would follow into a bar fight and discover you had signed up for a philosophy lecture instead. His hair had the texture of old bark. His eyes had the color of lakes right before thunder. He was not mine. He was married to a swampdream I had once touched by mistake and still had reeds in my teeth from.\n\n\u201cChild,\u201d he said, with the confidence of people who have decided the words that name you should be like coats, one-size and unisex.\n\n\u201cNephew,\u201d I said back, because rank and files have their pleasures.\n\n\u201cBellflower is mending something that needed to be mended,\u201d he said, which meant someone had asked a river to do a road\u2019s job again and she had gone to speak to the municipal planners and they had had polite tea and then she had broken a culvert with a look. \u201cSo I came to see what you were teaching the city about itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am teaching it a trick called that wasn\u2019t funny and it\u2019s okay to say so,\u201d I said.\n\nHe picked a burr out of his sleeve and rolled it between thumb and forefinger as if daring it to protest. \u201cAnd you used a mirror on a boy who eats reflections,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not here to scold you. I am here to warn you of the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a bill,\u201d I said. \u201cI can feel it in my joints and in my hair. He will not forget being seen. He will make me feel seen in a way I do not want, and I will have to pay attention to that feeling without sending the city to bed at eight with no supper. Is there a more technical term for this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a law,\u201d he said. \u201cStanding in a ring makes you think of laws even when you are the most lawless creature in the patch. You used the mirror for the truth and not for vanity. The bill is that you now owe the town your true story.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor how long?\u201d I asked, foolish as a child measuring the ocean with a cup.\n\n\u201cFor as long as Brill is amused,\u201d he said, which is to say for as long as it takes him to become bored with you, which is to say: longer than you think, shorter than you fear, exactly the amount of a summer that leaves you on a porch in September knowing the shape of cold.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of true story,\u201d I said, and the ring did that gasping laugh our kind does when a person has gotten cute with specificity. He shrugged.\n\n\u201cThe kind that pulls shame out like splinters and shows people how to stop apologizing to air,\u201d he said. \u201cYou already do it. Do it publicly. Bring your bowl, bring your bands, bring your friend with the letters on the fridge. The town will come because the town likes to see itself be brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like spectacles with me in them,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou have been in a spectacle since you made a home here,\u201d he said. \u201cRichmond Hill is a stadium if you stand on it wrong. Make your stadium cosy. Teach the bleachers to purr.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t conjure more kittens,\u201d I said, misreading him on purpose, because that is the only way to keep from doing what someone wants you to do immediately, which is an important muscle for a fairy who likes her own mind.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have to,\u201d he said, and his smile made me think of rain gutters. \u201cSometimes you invite something by being it. You have made a habit of gentleness. Habits are invitations with lace on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will charge someone for the lace,\u201d I said.\n\nHe laughed for real and expected me to leave, and I did, because lingering after you get your omen makes it look like you want to be told again and I do not. The city had wrung itself out and hung itself up. The sky was raw as a scraped knee but proud of itself. Brill had not checked in. He was folding himself somewhere into something that people would unwittingly unfold, and then he would tell them to be flattered when he wore them like a shirt.\n\nWe held the first story-night on the patch of lawn behind the band shell where the grass is always damp even when the days are cruelty. Layla printed a sign that said Tell It Like You Mean It, and below that, in smaller letters: No Jokes That Punch Down; No Jokes Sold As Therapy. Mr. Li brought a thermos the size of a child and handed everyone cups whether they wanted them or not. The brass players came because brass likes to sound like punctuation, and we needed punctuation more than we needed answers. I placed the white bowl on a hummingbird table and made it not milk. I made it water with the memory of milk, because I am not an idiot and I know an invitation when I have already written it. The mirror lay face down and showed me a fox if I wanted to think about it.\n\nThe first person up was the girl in the red shirt from the patio, whose chair scrape I had not forgotten. She had a hand on her stomach as if she was hiding a wound and a grin that did not know it was a weapon yet. She told a story about being the loud friend and about how sometimes you want to be the quiet friend and be asked to speak, and the chorus raised itself at the right place, which was when she said: I learned to leave my laugh at home and I came back and it had starved. The second was the man with the briefcase, who had nothing to declare but a father who didn\u2019t say anything nice until he turned seventy and then said everything too often, and somehow it was lovely when he admitted that when the compliments came he despaired because he had been practicing without them for too long. We all laughed where we should, which meant we didn\u2019t laugh where we shouldn\u2019t, which is a discipline that comes like music if you listen.\n\nBrill did not come in a coat of himself. He came as a whisper in the trees that carried the one-liners you tell when you are tired of earnestness, and then he went away because the oaks did not like it. He put two boys in the back into that mood where you want to say something clever and cruel so that the circle will notice you, and the boys swallowed the impulse and spoke about their mothers instead, which is the kind of miracle no church says is a miracle because it would wreck the hymns. He started a rumor in the corner that the bowl would turn anyone who looked into it into a cat for a week, and we let that rumor circulate because it gave the children practice in not believing what made their fur stand up.\n\nIt happened when the third reader, an auntie of no ring at all but of all the aunties the world makes for itself, stood up and said, \u201cMy brother died laughing and I am angry about it,\u201d which is a sentence that tries to be a paragraph and fails only because it doesn\u2019t have enough breaths in it. The kittens came then. Not from my pockets and not from the bushes but from the fact that a thing needed them. They came as if they had been stationed in gutters and under porches and on the ledges of basement windows, waiting for a note. Twenty, then fifty, then enough to make you feel like your ankles had become interesting property. They weren\u2019t a flood. Floods panic. This was a tide. They came and sat and blinked and not one of them made a sound beyond a purr so deep it tickled the worm-castings.\n\nNo one screamed because the story had taught them something already. A child laughed and then clapped both hands over their mouth because they\u2019d been told no we are listening and had learned that being shushed is a kind of attention if you do it with love. The auntie told us about the funeral and about the awful thing the cousin said that made everyone pretend to enjoy it and about the way that laughter felt like it was lifting her like a crane and then put her down somewhere she didn\u2019t recognize. She told us about how she had still cooked and folded and clocked in and out and how sometimes you want an audience automatically the way a wound wants air, and how that is not the same as healing. The kittens leaned against her ankles as if she had not noticed she was a building that needed reinforcement. The purr was an architecture.\n\nLayla caught my eye at the moment when the first cat looked at me and refused to be a metaphor. \u201cYou did this,\u201d she mouthed. I wanted to lie and say no it was the weather because weather is always a good scapegoat. I wanted to tell the truth the way Uncle told me to and say yes, this is what follows me when I am good. I shrugged, which is another way of saying I am attempting to tolerate responsibility without choking on it.\n\nBrill tested us. It is either a vice or a loyalty with him. He sent through the crowd a line about women and grief that would have laid ten aunties open like fish for market if it had gone where it meant to, and the line hit the purr and slid off. He tried with the children: a joke about librarians that would have made the kids look at Layla as if she kept secrets not for them but against them, and the joke caught in the fur that was now like grass and fell to pieces as if a child had taken it apart to see what it was made of and found only air and spit. He left because there is only so long you can talk to a room that has learned to prefer listening.\n\nAfter, when people were winding down and wiping eyes with the hems of clean sleeves and returning the cups to Mr. Li who somehow had more in the thermos than he had started with, I moved through the cats as if I were one of them. The key sang. I put it in the bowl because I needed to know if the world would let me. It nested like a fish in a still pond. A kitten stretched and yawned and put a paw in the water and hissed because cats must try everything and must complain when everything is what it is. The uncle\u2019s advice had been a clutch of thorns and I had grabbed it anyway, and my palms were full of stings and I felt whole.\n\nIt could have ended there, in the soft, and because it could, it didn\u2019t. A voice cut across the grass, not Brill\u2019s but the one he uses when he wants to sound like an authority and not like a friend. \u201cPermit?\u201d it said, which is not a fairy word unless we are laughing. Three municipal workers in rain jackets held clipboards as if they had brooms hidden in them, and they had come on an errand that had the smell of his mouth on it. \u201cThis is a public green,\u201d the tallest said in the tone of a person who has had to memorize a new script and is not sure whether the audience has learned the call-and-response. \u201cYou are\u2026 gathering.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Layla said, and stepped forward because that is her shape in a crisis\u2014it\u2019s a step, it\u2019s a forward, and none of us has gotten tired of it yet.\n\n\u201cYou need a permit for any public performance,\u201d he said, and the word performance tasted the way old plastic tastes if you chew on it by mistake.\n\n\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a public grief,\u201d the auntie asked him, so mild you would have missed the point if you had not taken a job where points are your staple.\n\nHe looked down at his form. The water from his cuffs dripped exactly where you would expect it to, which told me that magic had not reached those hems yet. \u201cWe have had a complaint about cats,\u201d he said, as if anyone in the history of this region had not.\n\n\u201cKittens,\u201d Mr. Li said, in a tone that did not commit to either mischief or obedience.\n\nI sensed in the close air the shape of Brill\u2019s grin, somewhere behind that man\u2019s left shoulder. Not a possession. A sponsorship. He had found another seam: the one where the rules keep us decent and also keep us small. He had filed a complaint, because even kings used to send a bailiff before they sent a blade, and he is nothing if not a king without furniture. He wanted me to argue on the grounds he had offered, then twist, then have to audience my way out while he held a stopwatch.\n\nI did not argue. I put my hands together as if I were praying to the idea of the city, and I said, to the clipboards and whatever was listening through them, \u201cWe are a story hour. We have a librarian, we have a book, we have a bowl of water and some cats who are sitting as if they were being read to. We are within noise bylaws. We have no amplification beyond brass, which in this municipality is sacred. If you would like to issue us a fine, we will pay it in pennies and parties.\u201d\n\nHe blinked because that is not how you speak to authority and also because it is exactly how you speak to authority when it is also an auntie in a nice vest. He passed his eyes\u2014poor, tired eyes\u2014over the faces and the fur. His shoulder softened half a millimeter, which is the kind of change that can stop a war. \u201cJust\u2026 keep the cats from the playground,\u201d he said, and because the world can be merciful if you feed it the right sentence in the right place, a tabby got up and stretched and led a small pilgrimage of kittens to the other side of the grass. The worker exhaled. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said to Layla, because she was closest and because she is what you say thank you to when you don\u2019t know the shape of what helped.\n\nWhen the crowd thinned and it was only us, which is to say the ones who would come back when it got cold and the ones who would bring a neighbor because it felt like cheating to keep this to yourself, I sat on the low wall and put my face in my hands and held my head gently to remind it it belonged to my neck. Layla put an elbow into my side because she knows better than to put a hand on a fairy in public unless you mean to adopt. \u201cYou did it,\u201d she said, and then laughed, a little angry because that is her luxury when she knows we are safe for ten minutes. \u201cYou made a cat choir. Of course you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and then corrected myself because the uncle and the mirror and my own skin demanded it. \u201cI invited. They came.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe woke something up,\u201d Mr. Li said, as if Brill were the weather and we were the leaves. \u201cAnd you told it we were a sanctuary, not a stadium.\u201d\n\nAt home the houseplants had organized a coup and decided to look wilty to get my attention. I misted everyone like a benevolent tyrant. The bowl went into the sink and made the note it makes when you put something holy into a place where we do our dullest work. The whisker key lay on the white of the bathtub and warmed the tile like a little sun, sulking because it had not been the star. I told it aloud that everyone gets their turn, which made me sound like a manager I swore I would never be.\n\nThe knock at my door came at an hour that does not exist on clocks but exists in bones; it was the hour when the city resets its shock absorbers and wonders whether to creak or sigh. I opened it because I am foolish or brave or because I had already seen who stood on the other side in three different reflections. Brill leaned in the hallway and admired my landlord\u2019s poorly painted baseboards as if he had designed them. He was damp as a dog and brighter than he had a right to be after being thwarted in front of trumpets.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re popular,\u201d he said, not looking at me, as if my popularity were an object he had set down someplace and forgotten.\n\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d I said. \u201cWith the Parks Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend bureaucracy isn\u2019t a band I can play,\u201d he said. \u201cYou caught that tune, too, I see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all trying to be decent,\u201d I said, which is a sentence that can make you sound smug if you aim it wrong, and which I have practiced saying with my throat shaped like an apology.\n\nHe put his shoulder against my doorframe and hummed the first bar of the song that used to call me when I was wild. \u201cI thought you would break the mirror,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to see what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you would drink the milk,\u201d I said. \u201cJust to see what happened.\u201d\n\nWe grinned at each other like enemies who had inherited the same aunt\u2019s ugly couch and had both secretly decided to love it out of spite. \u201cYou\u2019re going to ask me for kindness again,\u201d he said, with the weariness of someone who knows the flavor of their least favorite medicine.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I said. \u201cNot because I think you\u2019ll say yes, but because I think the asking is the kind of spell that keeps the doors open.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoors,\u201d he said, and looked past me at the key on the tub. \u201cYou and your keys.\u201d He lifted his chin. \u201cCareful with your kittens, Tammy-Tam. People are going to put their mouths on them and call it cute when what they\u2019re doing is learning that softness is a vending machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a price,\u201d I said. \u201cI always did. I\u2019ve made it clear. I take the moment you would have regretted and give you back an hour you can live in. They can send the bill to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd one day,\u201d he said, and the hallway light flickered because even electricity likes drama, \u201cone day, I will turn you into what you make. I\u2019ll do it cleanly. I\u2019ll do it with consent. I\u2019ll make you a kitten and I\u2019ll hold you in my hands and you\u2019ll see that softness is a blade too when you\u2019re not swinging it. Then we will call it even.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d I said, and it sounded like a prayer because I had Auntie Bellflower in my chest where she had told me to put her, and because the uncle\u2019s burr had gotten under my nail and made thinking easy.\n\nHe pushed off from the frame and walked down the hallway and did not look back because he knows better than to give me that victories in such small currencies. \u201cSoon,\u201d he said, a promise or a lie, and if there\u2019s a difference with him I have never found it.\n\nI closed the door and sat on the floor because sometimes you have to be low to feel high. The city breathed. The cats outside handled their wars and their courts and their romance under parked cars like the princes they are. I cleaned the bowl until it lost the last trace of sweet. I put my hand flat on the mirror until my face blurred into a truth that looked just like me. I thought about the story I owed and what it would cost to tell it right, which is always the price you pay when you come from people who think secrets are seasoning and you decide to be a meal somebody can eat without guessing spices.\n\nIn the morning the radio said that the headline was Kittens Disrupt Community Event, and Layla sent me a picture of the paper and a caption that read: they spelled disrupt wrong, and I sent back a picture of the bowl and a caption that read: they spelled kitten wrong. Auntie Bellflower sent no note because she knows the value of letting you not be praised. The uncle had left a burr on my windowsill, which is a joke where he comes from and a blessing where I live. I put it in my pocket next to the copper wire and thought about the parade of our ordinary days, and about how a joke can be a kindness if you remember to put a chair under the part of you that is going to sit down when the laugh shakes you. Then I went out to buy milk. It wasn\u2019t for me. I told myself that. But I felt the part of me that wanted to lap at the brim and be forgiven for once without doing any work and I told that part, steady now, we only ever get the miracles we are willing to clean up after.Chapter Five\n\nThe supermarket had that after-rain fluorescence that makes fruit look evangelized and the tile aisles feel like a ferry. The refrigeration units breathed clean, and the fans above the rotisserie chickens sounded like the tired wings of angels who had taken a side gig. I walked past pyramid stacks of nectarines that promised to bruise if you looked at them wrong and let my hand hover over cartons of cream that wanted to be in coffee and argued about it. The milk took up a full wall and still a woman beside me sighed like there was not enough of it in the world. I picked the one that pours best, which is a knowledge you only get if you pour for others often. The label had a cow on it that looked so content it was almost indecent, and someone had written on the shelf tag in pencil: local-ish. A worker with the posture of a retired dancer had left a mop leaning against an endcap that bragged about loyalty points. I looked at the loyalty points and saw Brill in them. He had taught the store to remember your third choice and offer it first, as if it were a summer fling circling back to propose.\n\n\u201cWant a sample?\u201d a man in a vest said to me, his hat hatched with rain salt and his eyes bright with the manic conviction of someone who has been told to be jovial or perish. He held out a thimble cup of yogurt in a flavor named after a dessert that should not be a yogurt. Behind him stood a boy with a face like a door left ajar, hopeful and wary.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d I said, gently enough that we were both let off the hook. The boy reached for my milk without thinking and then did think and took his hand back like it had found a hot pan. I smiled at him the way you smile at the part of a child that has not yet decided to remain a child.\n\nAt the registers a woman with a bruise on her arm shaped like a number loaded up a conveyor belt with seventeen cans of beans and two boxes of cereal with cartoon bees that look like they know your bank balance. The cashier looked like he had been born at his station and not minded. The monitor flickered and began to suggest recipes: beans with bravado, beans with apology, beans with the sentence you are not daring enough today and the next day you will be too careful. It was Brill\u2019s work, small and corrosive, disguised as convenience. The woman made a face like she\u2019d been offered a compliment by someone she didn\u2019t want to owe.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to turn it off?\u201d the cashier asked, and you could hear he was repeating a line, not offering a kindness. I pulled the mirror out of my bag under the pretense of checking the way the rain had arranged my hair, and tilted it so the screen saw itself for half a second. The recipes broke into numbers and then into letters and then into a sort of satisfied hum the way a cat will climb into a box, decide it is adequate, and sleep.\n\nShe caught my eye and nodded once. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said to no one, so the debt had a place to sit that was not my name.\n\nOn the way out I passed a pyramid of mangoes that had started to smell like a memory of a country I have never been to, and a brand ambassador offered me a card that would build a tally of my habits and present me with a joke about them every Friday. I declined. He did not insist; probably he had been to one of our nights and recognized my face, or else he recognized my refusal as a type he feared to catalog.\n\nOutside the rain had made a lace out of traffic and pinned it to the day. Cars hissed secrets at each other. The bus exhaled in the way of large animals pretending to be infrastructure. A woman in a green coat tilted her head to watch a squirrel execute a precision jump from one tree to another and then whisper, with feeling, \u201cShowoff,\u201d and the squirrel executed a second jump that you could only call an encore. I walked north with milk hip-braced against my side and wondered if I was ready to show anything to anyone tonight.\n\nThe bill for the mirror lay in my mouth, a coin I couldn\u2019t swallow. Layla would be at the library making a sign that was both solemn and silly, because if you don\u2019t do both you are making religion or you are making a party and neither will do. Mr. Li would arrive with his thermos and his patient hands. The auntie with the jaguar-grief would come because she had discovered that her laugh could be used for something besides carrying other people\u2019s weight. The municipal worker would come without his clipboard and with a fold-up chair, because I had seen a future in which he discovered the joy of being anonymous in a crowd of people who had decided to be known.\n\nI wanted to open the ring and ask Bellflower what kind of truth counts as tender and what kind counts as reckless. I wanted to be told that I could pay my debt with interest and then not think about it again. The fence considered me as I passed, all spruce eye and resin eyelid, and did not wink. The clover hissed a warning in a tiny voice. The backyard smelled like pies and mischief remembered. The ring can be stingy when you are about to publicly remove your own fur.\n\nAt home I set the milk on the counter with the carefulness I reserve for gifts and curses. The houseplants had rallied and did not require my drama. The whisker key thrummed on the tile as if it were counting down to a trick it desperately wanted to perform. The mirror lay face-up, catching the light that had more gray in it than it should have, showing me both the crinkles at my eyes and the part of me that still looks like the girl who walked into the ring without asking and forgot what to call herself until someone with a spider\u2019s patience spun the syllables back into a sound.\n\nThe truth I owed was a knot with my teeth in it. The first strand was winter. It was the winter I have already mentioned, the one where a boy was turning himself into a story because he had been told with such conviction that he was a story that he believed it more than the heat in his fingers. He had walked out onto Bond Lake in boots named after mountains, liked the music of the ice when it sang its submarine songs, and asked the cold to make him into something worth repeating. His mother had found his bike leaning against a fence like a faithful dog. I found his hat caught on a reed where the water was too thin for anything but foolhardy birds.\n\nI have a way with small things. I do not have a way with boys making larger choices. I stood on the shore and tasted the air and did the calculus you do when you are about to move without moving. I took the thread from my own dress and tied it around my wrist, which is how you anchor yourself to a truth you will want to escape later. I walked out, not onto the ice\u2014never onto the ice; we are not that arrogant\u2014but into the part of the lake that knows what to do with names. I said his name and heard that it had been left for a while in the care of a willow and had gotten sticky with sap. I called him back with the tone you use for cats and stubborn gods. He looked at me as if my face was something that only made sense once you warmed up. He said he didn\u2019t want to come. I said that was what stories say, and he was not a story yet. He asked what he would be instead. I said, to my shame, you will be alive, which is not an answer and too often a sentence. I did a wrong thing and then a right thing. The wrong thing was to take his hand without asking. The right thing was to give him a joke one of the aunties had taught me that belongs to winter: What do you call it when the wind holds your breath for you? Kindness. He came. The ice muttered but did not crack. The willow shook its shoulders and the sap let him go.\n\nAfter that, things in the city started to notice me in the way of animals with favors to return and grudges to nurse. The aunties met me in the ring and told me my habit had been set. They said: you will be the one with the kittens, you will be the one who answers the worst versions of what-ifs with soft yeses. They laughed at me kindly and gave me the whisker key and told me that one day I would have to buy myself back from the bargain I had struck with myself. I asked them for the return policy. They said: you have to tell the truth out loud where the judging is easy and the mercy is hard. I said: so, the internet? Bellflower hit me with a blade of grass and told me I was getting too clever.\n\nThe second strand was a girl named Keira who did not want help and did not need it until she did. She stood at a bus stop and let the rain collect on her eyelashes and pretended not to hear when the man beside her took a tone with her shoulders. He used the voice that says I am joking and you are not very fun. He used the body that says I am reaching for you and you should be flattered. The bus came and did not stop because it had been bewitched by a scheduling error. I did the thing I do. I kittened him. It made it a scene when what she had wanted was to be invisible. He went small and soft and confused and his friends hooted and pretended to be surprised that he had a whine on him. She looked at me with fury and gratitude and said, my problem is that I am always being taken into other people\u2019s jokes without being asked whether I am funny. Later she brought me a doughnut with cinnamon and sugar like home and told me her name and the names of the women who would call me if they needed me. That is a debt you pay with a ledger you aren\u2019t allowed to keep.\n\nThere is also a third strand that I do not tell, but I will have to tell, because the uncle said so and because Brill already knows the shape of it. It is Brill and me in a backyard with laundry that smells like lemon and an afternoon that thought it could go on forever. It is him asking me what I have that isn\u2019t kindness and me showing him the edge on it. It is him taking that edge and teaching himself how to cut without making a mess. It is the first time I heard his joke land inside a person I love, and the first time I failed to block it because I had been proud and late. It is a thing that I will say tonight if the milk looks back at me and tells me to.\n\nBy dusk the park had wrung itself out and combed its hair. The red ants had made a detour around the cap of a bottle someone had left, and the crows had called a meeting and then postponed it due to air. The children\u2019s section of the library had been disassembled and reassembled into a ghazal of blankets and chairs. Layla\u2019s sign read: Pay Attention, With Snacks. The brass players did their mouthpiece stretches and looked like men blowing kisses into their own hands, which is not a bad habit if you need to mine affection from the air. Kittens arrived without fanfare and arranged themselves like punctuation at the ends of rows. The municipal worker came in a shirt that said STAFF because the city is wry, and sat far left where he could make an exit without anyone blessing him or blaming him. Mr. Li placed his thermos as if it were an altar and poured cups for people who had never expected to be served anything for free in a public space.\n\nI looked for Brill and did not find him in any human shape. He was the feeling in the air when someone is about to remember what you owe them. He was the way the mosquitoes organized themselves into a choir and then forgot the melody. He was the point at the end of a sentence when you decide whether to be polite or to be true. I set the bowl at my feet and it made its resigned, useful sound. I set the mirror under the chair because this was not about me looking at myself when I could be looking at others. The whisker key pressed a vibration against my thigh in my pocket that said I could experiment if I wanted to, which is not a thing keys should say to their owners.\n\nLayla warmed the room with her voice. She told us about the first book she read that made her understand that she could read, a cheap children\u2019s thing with a turtle on a raft that had gotten caught in a reprint and come out with the first two pages dirtily doubled. She said, you think you have to start with the right words and sometimes you just start with the wrong words twice and then you catch up. People laughed in the way that feeds the body and does not nibble at the soul. She handed the floor to me because she knows about bills and has a sense of theater that she uses only for good.\n\n\u201cI owe you a story,\u201d I said, and felt in the soles of my feet the hush that means you are telling the truth even before you learned what it is. \u201cI owe you a story because I held a mirror up to a boy who eats reflections, and that\u2019s a trick that comes with a price. The price is this. I tell you who I was when I was too soft, and who I was when I was not soft enough, and who I am when I am exactly the right amount of soft for someone else and impossible for myself. I will not mention names because I am a keeper of them. I will make jokes, but they will not be used as knives. If you feel a laugh come up that is shaped like superiority, you are allowed to hold it in your mouth and taste it and then let it go without putting it in the air. If you feel a cry that would embarrass you if it were photographed, you may keep it in your pocket and take it out on your walk home. If you feel nothing, you are not broken. Not feeling is a feeling. I love you anyway, which is rude to say, but I do. I was taught to.\u201d\n\nThe law of our kind is mossy and written in fog, but it woke and rubbed its eyes and noticed me. I talked about the winter and the boy and the willow. I described the sound the ice makes when it wants to be helpful and knows that being helpful is how people die. The brass put a tender comma in the air when I needed one. The kittens in the front row stretched and prompted me to slow down. I told them about Keira at the bus stop and the way you can make a scene without making a mess, and the way the worst thing you can do is make someone a metaphor when they need to be a person. I told them about the first time an auntie made me feel messy and useful and how I loved her for that because the people who had held me before had wanted me to be a song, and I am not a song, I am a shelf, I am a key ring, I am a bowl.\n\nWhen I got to the third strand I took a breath that went down the wrong pipe and had to cough. A kitten ran head-first into my ankle in sympathy and then sat on my foot. I could have told them the easier story here. I could have told them about a hospital waiting room in January and the way the fluorescent lights make everyone look like they regret a decision they haven\u2019t made yet. I could have told them about the time I had to pretend to be a nurse because the nurse had to pretend to be a person and we were both bad at it. I owed the harder thing.\n\n\u201cHe told me a joke,\u201d I said, and let Brill emerge from the pronoun because if he wanted to be named he could have come. \u201cHe told me a joke dressed as a love letter, and I laughed, because he is very good, and because I am very good at being loved in ways that do not ask me to do any work. The joke was this: that if I never let anyone suffer near me, I will be necessary forever and never, therefore, alone. The punchline was this: that he would always bring me a little pain to fix so that I would never notice that he kept a big one for the times when I was looking the other way. I took that bargain for a year, which is a long time in fairy and a short time in human and exactly enough time for a city to learn your habit and feed you occasions. I hurt someone I love by being generous in a way that kept them small. I turned them soft when they wanted to be sharp, because I didn\u2019t want to hear the sound of their edge and I didn\u2019t want to feel the weight of their anger. I apologize to the air when I say this, because the person does not owe me their privacy back, but I apologize to you as well, because I have made a spectacle of softness and sometimes that spectacle denies people the dignity of their steel.\u201d\n\nThe park didn\u2019t move. The municipal worker shifted and then pretended he hadn\u2019t. Layla\u2019s face did the thing it does when she hears a note sung true even if the singer would have preferred to be a better musician. The brass put down their horns, blessedly. The kittens didn\u2019t fluff. You know how cats get big when you make a noise like a hawk? They didn\u2019t. They went smaller and nearer. A child put her hand on one and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d the way children who have had to say it to themselves do.\n\n\u201cI am learning to ask,\u201d I said, and this is a sentence that should have been a paragraph and the paragraph should have bought me several redeeming paragraphs more. \u201cI am learning to ask if you want the spell I have. I am learning to hear no when I want to hear please. I am learning to start with please. I am learning to listen to the joke before I try to break it. I am learning that when you hold a mirror up and someone hates it, the thing to do is not shatter the mirror but offer it flat and walk away.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t triumph. It never is. The stories paid some of the bill and left a tip and still there was a penny under the chair that I would have to come back for. Brill showed up then. He had to. He is a creature of timing and cannot bear to miss his cue. He didn\u2019t take a form. He moved through the crowd as a consensus. He said, in the voice of women who have been told their laugh is too much, \u201cYou think you are the first to discover honesty,\u201d and a dozen of us snorted. He said, in the voice of men who have never been told they were pretty, \u201cYou think your tricks make you brave,\u201d and a handful of kids said out loud, \u201cNo,\u201d which made me want to throw my keys at the moon and ask for a new set for this place where children could answer back correctly.\n\nHe told us a joke about towns that rescue themselves and become smug about it. He told us a joke about cats that think they are charms. He told us a joke about librarians who fall in love with their own gospels. He put hooks under the words and then the hooks hit the purring and slid off, not because the purr was a shield, but because the room had learned a countermelody. He got bored. He looked for a glass to drop. There were none. He looked for a man whose mother had given him a name he hated. That man had left his name at home on purpose and brought a nickname he wore like a hoodie that smelled like bonfire.\n\nBrill found me because he is compelled to. He spoke to the part of me that wants to be adored for usefulness and said, \u201cI am going to give you your wish,\u201d which is exactly wrong because I never wish out loud. He made the air smell like the inside of a bakery at three a.m. He made the bowl of milk I had not poured yet ache. He asked for my consent in the most honest voice I have ever heard him use. He said, \u201cLet me turn you into what you make. Let me hold you. Let me show you that you cannot do this forever.\u201d\n\nThere is a piece of Law that says if you are asked properly and you say yes, the aunties cannot step in and the uncles will turn their heads and the rings will pretend to be moss. Layla looked at me with a face that had all four punctuation magnets on it at once. Mr. Li placed a hand flat on the bench as if ready to test whether wood could carry a weight it hadn\u2019t been built for. The kittens put one paw each on my shoe and waited in case I fell and needed to be braced by smallness.\n\n\u201cNot even for a minute?\u201d Brill asked, and that is how the worst contracts are written: in minutes, in moments, in just until you\u2019ve had your fill. I wanted it. Of course I did. I wanted to be small and carried and adored by fingers that try to resist but cannot. I wanted to know what I have been handing out all this time without ever taking a portion. I wanted to see whether I am all fur and bones or if there is something else underneath that will reach for you with claws out if you stop petting. I wanted him to know that he could be gentle, because I suspect it would ruin him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because it is a sentence with the weight of a cathedral if you lean your shoulder into it properly. \u201cNot today. You are fun, but you are careless. I will not let carelessness do surgery on me.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, genuinely, because saying no to him turns him on in the way that makes his eyes lose their color and get too human. He said, \u201cLater,\u201d and this time it wasn\u2019t a threat or a promise; it was a fighting lesson. He left and took two mosquitoes with him, whose families will miss them and then be relieved.\n\nWe sat there in the after of it. People told their stories with the lights the city gives you for free\u2014streetlamps and moon and the glow from a distant baseball diamond where men with generous bellies and complicated marriages try to feel exactly as important as they were when they were seventeen. We clapped and did not whistle because a whistle makes a spell you don\u2019t want in a circle like this. The kittens dispersed with the air of creatures who have got tips in cash and in sardines. I washed the bowl at the standpipe behind the band shell and the water said thank you via a slant against my wrist. Layla stacked chairs with a competence that makes strong men propose and she declined none of them and all of them simultaneously by smiling with what she has instead of what she owes.\n\nOn the walk home the rabbits acted like they owned the sidewalk and I let them. A couple under a porch light kissed like they had not yet learned that the first kiss can be startling and then a map, and I did not look away, which is not rude, it is witness. The night had lost that strobe of impending. It wore a sweater. It was boring. I nearly wept with gratitude for the boredom of a Canadian suburb when the bad jokes are pointed at someone who can take them and take them apart.\n\nMy landlord had left a notice about water shutoffs for repairs that would not happen on the day indicated, and his cat had knocked it sideways so that it read WAR SHUF. She looked at me as if I had done it and I took the blame because you should always take the blame from someone who has whiskers and no thumbs. In the bathroom the whisker key rolled into my palm as if it had changed its mind about sulking. It vibrated in frequencies only my teeth understood. I sat on the edge of the tub and held it and said thank you without asking for a thing, and for once it hummed back without demanding a door.\n\nI dreamt of a kitchen where every drawer had a secret I had put there and forgotten. I dreamt of a bus where every seat had a kitten and a man stood in the aisle and wept because he had found something that quieted the noise in him without asking him to punch holes in anyone else\u2019s air. I dreamt of Brill as a boy who had not yet learned to operate his own elegance and who dropped it like a plate and cleaned it up clumsily and no one laughed. I woke to a morning that was an ordinary Monday. The radio talked about road closures and the price of avocados and the mayor\u2019s latest attempt to make the city a verb. Layla texted: inventory day send help, and then: actually send croissants, and I sent both, because love is a choice and logistics.\n\nThe uncle had left a burr on my windowsill again. This one had a spider web in it that glittered in a way that I recognized as a hint. If you want to catch bigger problems, you make a bigger web, but you make the strands further apart so that the small things still go through. I put the burr by the whisker key and the mirror and the bowl and stood back and felt like a witch, which is not an insult where I come from. The Law tucked itself back into the cracks. The bill had a dent in it. I owed more, but not in a way that would eat me whole.\n\nBy lunchtime the headlines had multiplied like mushrooms: Community Cats Charm Crowd; Unauthorized Therapy Event Reported; Jokes Are Serious Business, Says Librarian; Local Fairy Declines To Be Cute, City Divided. I took the parcels to the library and let myself in the back and put the croissants on the shelf where Layla hides her victories. The children built a fort out of encyclopedias that are now written in pixels, and a boy with too many teeth said to me, solemnly, \u201cWe don\u2019t need cats today because we have capes,\u201d and I saluted him as if he\u2019d outranked me. Brill sent me a picture on a number I had not given him of my whisker key with a caption: you\u2019ll never open me, and I replied with a picture of a bowl of milk with none of my reflections in it and a caption: I don\u2019t have to.\n\nOn the street outside the Finch a guy in a blazer practiced his apology to a door. It is a useful skill, apologizing to things. The used bookshop sign had finally given up on the B and proposed U SED OOKS, which is closer to a truth than you\u2019d think. The storm drains breathed and forgot themselves and remembered. The summer leaned on its elbows and considered starting again. I had to go see Auntie Bellflower because she would not congratulate me and I needed the practice in being unpraised. I had to see Brill somewhere other than a room full of other people and stand near him without letting my pulse dictate the hour.\n\nI took the milk with me because I am stubborn and because he had asked and because I had said no and because sometimes no has to be fed, too. In the ring the clover looked smug and the fence finally winked like I had gotten over myself. Auntie Bellflower sat on her mushroom with her tiny bone harp and a face like a poem that doesn\u2019t resolve. \u201cWell,\u201d she said at once, to save us both from my report, and then, \u201cShow me your hands.\u201d\n\nI showed her the palms I had held the night in and the fingers I had pointed at jokes, the nail with the burr sting under it and the callus that comes from carrying groceries instead of grief. She took them and turned them over and put one against her cheek like she was listening. \u201cYou paid some of it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never pay all of it. That\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the point,\u201d I said, which is a question we ask each other at least once a month and then refuse to answer the same way twice.\n\n\u201cThe point is that he tried to put the town in a room he had rented in his head, and you opened the windows,\u201d she said, and then she flicked my ear for being pleased. \u201cHe is going to try again. He is going to bring cameras. He is going to ask you for small yeses until you are exhausted, and then he will ask you for a big one when you want to be adored. Do not make a habit of no. It will make you brittle. Make a habit of choosing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate how you\u2019re always right,\u201d I said, which is worship in our family.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cHate is a rope you can pull yourself up with. Love is a net. Use both. Bring milk. Bring mirrors. Bring Layla. Bring your landlord\u2019s cat if she lets you. Teach the city the difference between a performance and a practice.\u201d\n\nOn my way back out the mulberry tree dropped three ripe fruits on my shoulder on purpose and I put one in my mouth and it inked my tongue and tasted like sugar the first time you can afford your own grocery bill. The ring closed. The afternoon opened. Brill was somewhere doing something with someone else\u2019s pity. The city was mine in the way it is anyone\u2019s who decides to set their tools down and call a place a place they will defend. I went to the pond. Mr. Li waved. Children in sandbox grit made castles that would be destroyed by weather and felt, for once, both urgent and unimportant about that. The brass practiced the bridge of a song with a name that smelled like rain on concrete. I put the bowl on the bench and let the cats drink, which is an invitation and a refusal and a covenant and also a chore if you do it right, and believe me, I intend to do it right.Chapter Seven starts where ordinary picks itself up and goes to work again, which is to say the morning after felt like a Monday made out of lint and errands, but underneath it, the city had a buzz like a fluorescent tube when it\u2019s about to go. The headlines laminated themselves to coffee shop tables as if anyone had ever been convinced by ink to change their mind. The kittens went back to being municipal punctuation marks. Layla texted me a picture of a flyer slapped crooked over the community corkboard between a call for babysitters and a guitar teacher: LAUGH-IN RICHMOND HILL! LIVE TAPING! SPECIAL GUESTS! CONSENT FORMS PROVIDED! The font had that particular optimism that smells like LED stage lights. It had Brill\u2019s curve to it, the way the exclamation points leaned like they\u2019d learned to do at his knee.\n\nI had told Auntie Bellflower I would not make a habit of no, and I meant it, but I am capable of a beautiful and elaborate maybe. I walked to the library because that is where we plan our maybes; Layla had a spread of clipboards and pens and a stack of signs that couldn\u2019t decide whether they wanted to be polite or effective. The children\u2019s section hummed in the register where truth hides, low enough to calm but high enough to irritate anyone who came in looking for silence. We took the flyer and read it together like it might be willing to confess.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring cameras,\u201d she said, which was unoriginal and accurate.\n\n\u201cThe cameras are not the problem,\u201d I said. \u201cThe problem is the audience he thinks he is bringing with them. The problem is the laugh track he wants to splice in between us and our breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we seed our own audience,\u201d she said, and set her mouth like a door you have to push because it sticks in humidity. \u201cWe make people who know where to place their laughter, who know how not to feed him, who know what to do when a consent form has teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we teach first,\u201d I asked, because we both know that the course you think you\u2019re teaching is never the one people actually learn.\n\nShe took the flyer and flipped it over to the blank side\u2014blank except for the faint smell of toner and the ghost of the exclamation points bleeding through like a premonition\u2014and wrote: Rules For Watching Each Other. She did not number them, because numbering makes people argue with you in sequence. She wrote: listen before you laugh; and: if you can\u2019t tell who the joke is for, it isn\u2019t for you; and: if a form makes your stomach feel like a fist, don\u2019t sign it alone. I added: you can always walk away even if the camera is on you; and: the world won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t give anyone a reaction.\n\nWe made copies and stocked the library with them as if they were immunizations and sent children home with one each tucked into their summer reading lists under a sticker with a turtle on a raft. The municipal worker whose shirt had said STAFF\u2014Hardeep, as it turned out, with the soft H of a family that knows more than one language and speaks all of them with respect\u2014came by on his lunch and took a handful of the sheets as if he were doing inventory for a shortage. He leaned on the desk like a man who had just discovered that bureaucracy comes with a conscience if you put your ear to it and rest there awhile.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be asked to issue a permit,\u201d he said, giving me the expression of someone who doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019s the messenger or the fuse. \u201cIf you can make it boring, that helps. If you can make it boring and fun, you\u2019ll save me some paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the queen of boring and fun,\u201d I said, and Layla snorted and then turned it into a cough because she has not yet made a habit of letting me be right in public.\n\nThe taping was slated for Hillcrest because nothing says civic like a mall pretending to be a piazza under skylights that pinch the sky into diamonds. In the hours between the flyer and the event, Brill did what he does best: he set table after table with little amuse-bouches of cruelty, small freebies that make you arrive hungry. The mall\u2019s screens began to run a feed called YOU KNOW THAT FRIEND? and asked people to describe their friends in ways that would have gotten them exiled from rings in better eras. The loyalty points program sent a push notification to phones that said if you laughed out loud on camera today you could earn double points for purchases in categories called Confession and Indulgence. A kiosk near the food court hung a sign that read CONSENT STATION, where a very sweet woman with clipboard and smile offered releases that put your name into a wallet Brill could take home and spend without asking. We got there early, which is another way of saying we were already behind.\n\nI wore the shoes I can stand in for hours without debating my own shins and a shirt that read LOCAL NOISE across the front because I had hopes for my subtlety and I have been wrong before. The whisker key hummed in my pocket like it wanted to introduce me to someone. The mirror lay wrapped in a scarf in my bag; I did not take it out because places like this have mirrors everywhere and none that work the way you need them to. Layla took her position at the library\u2019s pop-up table we had elbowed between a phone case cart and a cupcake display; she made the Rules look like something you get for free and secretly would have paid for. Hardeep hovered near the potted tree that thinks it is outdoors and watched his fellow city employees unfold stanchions with the tenderness most people reserve for new babies.\n\nBrill arrived later than he could have and earlier than he should, which is his favorite technique. He had traded his denim for a jacket that fit him as if he had grown inside it in a warm climate. He was not alone, because he is never alone in places like this; he was surrounded by a moving, breathing rig that looked like a spider one of our uncles might have dated in a bad period: arms out for microphones, eyes of glass and bright insect hunger, legs that bent where they don\u2019t on humans. The production company had a name that would have embarrassed a deity but endeared a startup: LaughLines. A boy whose face was trying out the shape of beard carried the kind of camera that makes people think their lives were happening all along, they just hadn\u2019t been filmed yet.\n\n\u201cTammy-Tam,\u201d Brill said, in the tone that makes people think you have already messed up and it is sweet he loves you anyway. \u201cI see you brought pamphlets. I adore pamphlets. They make everyone look like they care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do care,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich is why we print.\u201d\n\nHe made his mouth into a shape I wanted to pinch and then stopped wanting to. \u201cI have a segment called Ask The Town,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask the town: what\u2019s funny because it\u2019s true? And then I ask: what\u2019s true because it\u2019s funny? And then I ask: what happens if you stop pretending? You will love it. It will break nothing. Sign a form.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not sign a form I haven\u2019t read backwards while standing upside down,\u201d I said, and the camera boy snorted before he hid it. I like camera boys. They are always someone\u2019s nephew and frequently think too much of lenses and not enough of eyes. He had a sticker on his water bottle that said the revolution will be livestreamed and I hoped for his sake he had a friend who had told him the revolution is also making dinner and doing dishes and calling your mother.\n\nLayla placed a stack of the Rules on the consent station table. The sweet woman with the clipboard read one and looked relieved and slid it under her own forms as if it could be a cushion. Hardeep moved stanchions so that the crowd couldn\u2019t bottleneck and become ugly; there is a magic to traffic control and some people practice it without spells. The mall pretended to be outdoors with more confidence and less ventilation than the real outdoors; the skylights made a lace of light and glare that gave everyone a halo and a headache.\n\nThe first person to be interviewed was a man in a shirt that read DAD JOKES LOADING, which made me want to buy him a better line and also hold his hand. He said something about marriage that could have landed harmless, and Brill absently sharpened it and tossed it into the air, and it cut the space and then fell point-first into a woman\u2019s day ten feet away and she pretended not to bleed. I put my palm flat on the tile and told the mall to be a meadow. The tile did not know how. The plants in their pots tried to help and ended up inhaling a rumor and coughing.\n\nI slid to the edge of the crowd and looped copper wire around a stanchion base because brass and copper and things that remember lightning are friends. I drew a thin line in chalk along the white seam between tiles as if I could remind the floor it had a spine. I set the bowl at my feet with water that had been milk in a recent life and watched the surface settle until it looked like it was thinking of me kindly. If you think all this is superstition, you are half right; the other half is logistics.\n\nBrill started his segment. He asked a teenager what they were afraid to say online and the teenager said their parents\u2019 names because those are the names the internet eats first. He asked a woman what she thought of the kittens and she said they made her cry and he made it sound like a punchline; it wasn\u2019t. He looked at me out of the side of his life and said, \u201cDo you believe in brave laughter?\u201d because he knows how to make a room feel like it\u2019s the test you didn\u2019t study for. I opened my mouth to say the thing I had planned to say and he surprised me by putting his hands up like a man showing his pockets for a frisk and said, \u201cBefore you answer, a word from our sponsor,\u201d and the cameras swung to a banner that had unrolled over the second-floor rail like a bad prophecy. It said: SOFTNESS ON DEMAND. Under it: Subscription kits for feelings; order now, get a free apology.\n\nIt is his vice and our shared season that he wants to commodify everything but refuses to allow himself to be priced. He smiled under the banner like a man walking his own joke down the aisle. I could have stood there and been irritated and given him a better show. Instead, I stepped sideways into the back hallways where the mall keeps its bones: the service corridor with the smell of dust and freight, pipes above hissing reminders that water goes where it is told until it doesn\u2019t. The camera boy saw me and did not follow because something in him has not been completely colonized by content. I found the door with the keyhole that looks like a yawn and told the whisker key to try its teeth.\n\nIt hummed like a tuning fork finally tapped by the correct impatience. The door did not open into a room, because rooms are nothing here. It opened into the place where the mall\u2019s nervous system talks to itself, where the routers blink in self-importance and the bundles of cable lie like snakes pretending to nap. It sounded like a thousand bees explaining civics. It felt like a comment section through your shirt.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said, because if I have learned anything, it is that manners are a tool and a shield and occasionally a sword. The network recognized the flavor of my voice because Layla had taught it boredom and I had taught it to expect biscuits. A wall of screens flickered to show a mirror of the mall from moments ago; you could see Layla\u2019s hand as it arranged someone\u2019s fear into a stack that would not topple. You could see Brill\u2019s joke clotting at the corners. You could see a red circle in the corner of a screen that meant people in other places would be watching soon.\n\nConsent in a place like this is a box you check and a vein you open. I walked along the racks and told each one: matte. I slid the copper wire under a switch and told it: be polite. I put my palm against a fan and told it: keep secrets unless asked. The whisker key sang when I came to the node that smelled of his mouth. It wasn\u2019t a possession so much as a fondant he had spread across the code to make it take his fingerprints. I took the mirror out of the scarf and held it so that the machine could see itself. There is a rumor that computers cannot see; it is false. They see themselves in the greed of their designers and the shame of their users. They see and they forget. I made this one remember.\n\nThe feed on the screen stuttered. The moving rig out in the atrium jerked as if someone had tugged a string in its spine. I heard, faintly through the vents, the crowd noise fall a notch as if the kind of laughter that hurts had been told to wait its turn and be registered. A supervisor in a high-visibility vest came into the room behind me and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be in here,\u201d and I said, \u201cYou are correct,\u201d and kept my hand on the fan until it hummed Yes, Auntie. He stood like a man in a dream who has not yet decided whether to be furious or to be new. He looked at the bowl of milk under the rack\u2014the bowl I had not carried with me and yet was present, white and useful\u2014and made the face of someone who just remembered being a child fed by a tired hand. \u201cDon\u2019t spill,\u201d he said, because that is a sentence that, in an emergency, can save a world.\n\nWhen I came back into the atrium, the banner had been unfurled a second time and the unsubtle noun phrasing had realigned itself to be less a threat and more a question: SOFTNESS, ON PURPOSE? The consent table had two lines: one to sign and one to unsign, and the unsigning line was longer. I stood next to Layla and smiled at the camera because sometimes putting your face in the thing takes the sting out of it. Brill held the microphone and did not look surprised or pleased. He looked like a man who has been handed a wrench and told there was a leak and now has to decide whether he is the kind of person who learns to fix a leak or the kind who makes jokes about plumbers.\n\n\u201cAsk your town,\u201d I said to him, low enough that only the microphone and he could hear me. \u201cAsk it with tenderness and see what you get. If you ask with barbs, you\u2019ll get blood and think it\u2019s wine. You\u2019re better at this than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am better at what I am better at,\u201d he said, and there was a ripple of real hurt there that made me want to stroke something on him and also slap it away. \u201cDo your trick. Make me a kitten. Give us the clip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the clip,\u201d I said, and he smiled; it is his cruelty that he admires the correct refusal even when it denies him a weapon. \u201cI will answer your segment instead.\u201d\n\nHe swung the mic toward me like a baton. The camera boy focused and then relaxed his shoulders because someone had told him once that tension shows through the lens and he had believed them. \u201cTamsin,\u201d Brill said into the camera in his honey that tastes more like sugar the second day it\u2019s open, \u201cbelieves in brave laughter. Tell us about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrave laughter,\u201d I said, like it was a animal I had sometimes fed and sometimes chased off my porch, \u201cis when you hear the worst idea in you say hello and you don\u2019t feed it. Brave laughter is when you laugh after you have done the work, not before. Brave laughter is when the person next to you feels their shoulders drop because your laugh did not include the cost of their dignity. Brave laughter is when you step away from the joke and don\u2019t point to say who should take your place under it. Brave laughter is when you notice the heckler in your own head and say, not today, you little creep, I\u2019m making soup.\u201d\n\nPeople laughed at the word soup, which is proof that there is still hope. The mall hummed. The production rig took its teeth out in order to swallow. Brill gave me the microphone, which meant he had lost the thread he had wanted to braid and was considering whether to cut it or make a friendship bracelet out of it. He whispered, just for me, \u201cYou are so good on camera,\u201d and I whispered back, \u201cThat is your fault,\u201d and his smile did a complicated math it isn\u2019t polite to watch.\n\nHe pivoted, because that is his salvage. He found a man in a suit with hotel confidence and asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s your truest laugh?\u201d The man did the thing men do when asked to be sincere in front of strangers and ordered a joke like it was a drink. Brill waited, which is not a habit of his, and when the man gave up and shrugged, allowed something gentle into his tone and asked, \u201cDid anyone make you laugh when you were small?\u201d The man said, \u201cMy sister,\u201d with a softness that reminded his tie of rainfall, and he told a story about a time they had hidden under the table during a flood\u2014not a real flood, a plumbing catastrophe\u2014and made faces at each other until the adults calmed down. It was not cruel. It was almost kind. The crowd made a hum of relief like a building settling into itself after being tipped. The camera boy checked his frame and exhaled like he had found a song he had been trying to remember for days.\n\nThe segment did not turn virtuous; nothing ever does that quickly. A kid wanted to show off and said something about librarians that would have made a lesser woman murder by etiquette, and Layla put her elbow on the table and said, imperturbable, \u201cTry again,\u201d and the kid tried again and did better and got a sticker that said REVISED and was proud of it. The consent station gave a couple their forms back with staples and advice. Hardeep moved the stanchions like a shepherd who had discovered that flocks will sometimes tell you where they need to go if you give them choice. Brill slipped jokes under doors and I wedged my foot in where I could and caught them before they hit the ankles of people who were tired.\n\nWhen it was done, which is to say when the mall\u2019s afternoon said I have to pick up my kids and go to karate now, Brill came over and leaned on the table and examined the Rules like they were insect wings pinned to cork. He tapped the line about walking away with his middle finger and smiled without teeth. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach them to walk away from me,\u201d he said, and I could have told him that the town had taught itself to walk away from worse with fewer pamphlets, but I am trying to cultivate not being cruel. \u201cYou have to offer something to walk towards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d Layla said, not looking at him. \u201cBooks. Each other. Soup.\u201d\n\nHe did his bow that says either you have my attention or I am making room to run. The rig breathed around him and he exhaled with it as if to teach it to be human. \u201cTonight?\u201d he said to me, because he likes to pretend evenings are his alone. \u201cUnder the bridge? Or do you need a bandshell to feel brave?\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d I said, \u201cwhere it is quiet, where we can hear ourselves,\u201d and he winced in theatrical pain because he hates to give up witnesses even for a minute. He glanced at the camera boy, and the boy nodded and tucked his camera in its foam as if he had been told he was off the hook and given a lollipop besides.\n\nThe bridge runs over the little river that believes vehicles are more temporary than stones. The graffiti under it tries hard to be a liturgy and the damp there is benevolent unless your shoes have secrets. I brought my bag and my bowl and my mirror and my key, which is to say I brought the Mars and the Venus and the Saturn of my little solar system. Layla did not come because this was not her fight and also because she promised to come if I did not come home by eleven and call the cops, which is friendship in a town where the cops do not know what to do with fairies and cats and jokes except write reports that sound oddly like field notes.\n\nHe came out of the darkness like he had always lived there and we were visitors who had to speak politely. The water made its complicated vowels and the cars overhead spoke in consonants. The mosquitoes held a tiny union meeting and agreed to leave us alone in exchange for blood later from joggers who call themselves runners and are right. He wore a jacket and no shirt because he likes to be dramatic about climate and because his chest is an argument he thinks he can win. I looked at the bridge piles, at the marks where ice had scoured last winter like fingernails on a table, and put my bowl down without making a ceremony of it.\n\n\u201cI will ask you again,\u201d he said, as if I had been the one who wanted him to. \u201cLet me turn you into what you make.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot tonight,\u201d I said, in the tone you use when you do not want the night to become a character.\n\nHe tilted his head and smiled and shook his hands out as if he had to throw off applause that did not exist. \u201cThen tell me a secret,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me one that costs you and feeds me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did that already,\u201d I said. \u201cYou were there and you took notes.\u201d\n\nHe took one step closer like a man testing a sheet of ice, and I felt the desire to be nice rise in me like a fog. I put the mirror up to my own mouth and said, \u201cNo,\u201d and watched it grow simpler on the glass. He made a noise the city sometimes makes when it learns it cannot bend a river: pretty and petty and pleased to be resisted. He perched on the low wall and let his ankles dangle over water that knows your name longer than your friends do.\n\n\u201cYou are practice,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is your charm. People know what to do around you. You put things in order, even the soft things. I am performance. I make things happen when they should not and everyone is grateful or angry and cannot tell which is which.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like it makes us equals,\u201d I said, because I can be mean when I have to remind him that he is not my match just because he wants to be.\n\nHe leaned forward like a cat offered lemon. \u201cDo not get arrogant,\u201d he said, and it cut enough that I understood he had seen me puff and chose to cut me down rather than adore me back to decent size. \u201cThe town loves you because you are useful. It loves me because I am dangerous. We can trade positions any time and hate each other anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to trade,\u201d I asked, as if it were a question with answers instead of a rhetorical letter to a god who never does his own work.\n\nHe looked at the water and remembered it had once let him drown a duke without letting the duke die. He looked at me and remembered my hands on the neck of a kitten who was also a boy who was also a story. He sighed, which is what he does when he wants to be human. \u201cI want you to stop being my conscience,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want you to stop needing one,\u201d I said.\n\nHe laughed, and the bridge vibrated in sympathy. \u201cThere will be cameras at your story nights next time,\u201d he said, not quite warning. \u201cThey will come without my invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will teach them what applause is for,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s for thank you, not for please more pain.\u201d\n\nA train went by far enough away that its sound arrived like advice from an uncle you respect and dislike. He watched it as if it were an animal he might someday learn to be. \u201cBellflower will say she cannot help you,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will then help you anyway and pretend it was an accident. You will say you do not want to be praised and then you will hoard good words like a thrift store that only sells compliments. You will make a mistake on purpose to relieve the pressure and then hate yourself for failing. I will watch you and know that I am watching for the moment you forgive yourself and I will hate you for being capable of doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is accurate,\u201d I said, which is why I have to talk to him sometimes: he names the ugly correctly and then decides it is a cologne. \u201cThere is a child in our town who will one day try to be you. I am trying to make it so that when they try, they choose me instead.\u201d\n\nHe flinched as if I had offered to cut off his hand. \u201cLeave them to me,\u201d he said, and I did the noise in my throat that raccoons make when you try to put them in a bag.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d I said, and it sounded like a prayer again because so much of what I have learned to say to him comes out of churches I refuse to admit to. He didn\u2019t. He left because his body has a calendar that says it is time to go when the moon reaches a certain slant on the bridge\u2019s concrete. He left because staying would have made us something we are not. He left and the water congratulated itself on being water and not wine.\n\nWhen I got back to my building, the landlord\u2019s cat was sitting on the steps like a judge waiting to be asked for leniency. She looked at me in that way of cats that says I know everything and will tell you nothing and also my bowl is empty. I filled her bowl because you owe the gods of your street their sacrifices. The notice about water shutoffs had been replaced with one about filming; our block was going to be a location for a scene where two actors in jackets too thin for their season would argue about whether to take a job in Montreal. I took a pen and wrote underneath: no filming between the hours of four and six because that is when the lashes of the neighborhood curl and we are at our most beautiful, and someone below my handwriting wrote: agreed.\n\nAt home the houseplants had leaned toward the window in a way that made it look like they were gossiping about my choices. I set the mirror face down because I needed it to stop telling the room that I exist. The whisker key rolled on the table until it lay with its handle against the burr the uncle had left; the spider web glinted there and made a geometry that whispered: bigger web, wider holes, catch only what you intend. I texted Layla a heart and a fox and a cat and she sent back a horseshoe and a coffee cup and the string of letters that means I am too tired to call you but I know what you did.\n\nThe next day the cameras came to story night without anyone\u2019s invitation because that is what they do now: they arrive at places where people are trying something difficult and ask for ten seconds out of context. We had prepared. Hardeep had borrowed stanchions and stood them not to corral people but to mark the visible edges of our circle. The brass had polished their bells and practiced a soft double-tongue that sounds like rain you forgot about because you were laughing. Layla had added to the sign: No Filming Of Other People Without Asking, and underneath that: All Stories Are Owned By The Mouths That Tell Them. Mr. Li had brought two thermoses and a dozen porcelain cups because paper cups breed a certain thoughtlessness we were fresh out of patience for.\n\nThe camera boy showed up with his lens cap on and his moral compass functioning. He had brought two friends who looked like they had been told to capture authenticity and were trying not to flinch. Brill did not come; he had done his show and had a date somewhere with a person who thinks they can read him. The kittens came as if the word had spread that gentle might happen again. The children wore capes and Gatorade moustaches. The municipal worker set down his jacket and helped an auntie drag a bench into the shade because the late-day sun had decided we were a parade and wanted to inspect us.\n\nI went first because sometimes that is the work, and told a short story about a time when I was a child and thought a thunderstorm was my fault because I had yelled at the sky for being so blue it made me miss the lake. People laughed where it helped and didn\u2019t where it didn\u2019t. The cameras stayed back and shot wide. A boy read a poem about his grandmother\u2019s hairnet that made Layla cry a little and a woman told a joke that made Hardeep almost drop a cup and the kittens took it all in as if it were a heat lamp. The microphones, if they were on, captured the purr. It was an effect you could sell if you had no soul.\n\nA man stepped into the circle without raising his hand and announced that he was a comedian and had notes for us. He used the word freedom three times with different intonations. He believed that the phrase punching up has only two axes. He did not read the sign. He began an anecdote about women in bookstores that was not going to end well for women or for bookstores. Layla stood and said, \u201cNo thanks,\u201d and he looked at her with the face men make when they are about to quote a First Amendment and then remembered we are in Canada and flailed for a Charter of Rights and Freedoms he had not read recently. I put my hand up gently and said, \u201cYou\u2019re at the wrong venue,\u201d and the crowd did not jeer because they have learned how to not feed him even when he looks hungry.\n\nThe cameras rolled and we made something worth rolling on. A woman who had never spoken in public told us about the time she laughed at a wake and how it saved three people. A kid forgot the end of his story and the brass put in a comma that turned into an ending all on its own. A librarian who is not Layla but who owes Layla the same debt we all do admitted to stealing time to read when she was a girl and the way the stolen time tasted like mint gum and guilt. We applauded where it mattered and let the space between the applause be the lesson. The camera boy took off his cap and put it over his heart once and I forgave him some future trespass.\n\nAfter, when the sun had done that thing where it is still light and yet the day is over, Brill texted me a picture of himself drinking milk with a caption: practicing, and I sent back a picture of my whisker key lying on the burr with a caption: same. Auntie Bellflower sent a leaf through the mail slot and it landed on the mirror and made it look like a pond with a lily on it, and I felt the city sigh like it had done its stretches and could now go to sleep without nightmares. I am not foolish enough to think that lasts. But I am brave enough to set a bowl on the bench and fill it and invite the town to drink tenderness on purpose, and I am stubborn enough to wash that bowl every time until the ring around it tells a story I can live with.\n\nThere is still a bill in my mouth. There is still a clip coming where someone catches me from an angle that makes me look like everything I say I am not. There is still the child Brill will try to shape and the night he will show up with the men who like to test their knuckles. There is still the winter and the willow and the boy whose name I pull back through sap and the friend I turned soft when she needed to be sharp and how I will someday ask her to forgive me with her edge intact. There is soup to make. There are spiders to thank. There is a mall to keep matte. There is a bridge to walk by without making it a symbol every time. There is this town that thinks it is a cul-de-sac and is actually a crossroad disguised as a cul-de-sac so you don\u2019t panic when you find yourself here. There is me. There is him. There is a bowl. There is a key. There is a mirror. There is a laugh that doesn\u2019t hurt anyone and I am going to teach it to as many mouths as I can before we run out of summer.\n\nI slept that night like a cat in a laundry basket, which is to say with my spine arranged in a way that would alarm a chiropractor and my heart near the clean things. In the morning the radio said there had been a minor incident at Hillcrest in which a banner changed its own punctuation and no one was harmed. The used bookshop sign had lost the B altogether, which left U SED O OKS, which I chose to translate as You seed oaks, which is a message I took more personally than it was intended. A man at the bus stop smiled at me and said, \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you\u2014\u201d and I said, \u201cYes, I live here,\u201d and he nodded like that was all anyone ever wanted to be famous for. On the ring, the clover did its self-satisfied hiss and the fence winked, and the aunties neither praised nor scolded me, which is better than a cake if you are made the way I am. I put the bowl down and poured out what we had. A kitten came and drank and then looked at me with the face of a creature who has already forgiven me for the next mistake and I told it, steady now, I am learning to make fewer of those.Chapter Nine\n\nThe day began with a sky the color of a fresh eraser, soft and stubborn and apt to smudge, and the radio trying to convince me that rush hour is an animal that can be domesticated if you speak to it in a soothing tone. The used bookshop sign had finally surrendered its B and was trying out personalities\u2014U SED O OKS at dawn, USE DOOKS by nine\u2014like a teenager testing hair. On my way to the library a wind lifted napkins and made paper birds out of other people\u2019s lunches, and a bus sighed in three keys, and every sound seemed to be rehearsing for something I did not yet have a ticket to. The bill in my mouth\u2014the one you bite and keep under your tongue so you don\u2019t spend it by accident\u2014had shrunk enough that I could taste coffee around it, which felt like a mercy and a setup, because Brill is not a creature who enjoys leaving change on the counter.\n\nAt the children\u2019s desk Layla had turned clipboards into a fort and was issuing pencils like passports, and the paper cranes above her were arranging themselves into phrases by accident: BE KIND, BE QUIET, BE K\u2014 and then giving up because the ceiling fan liked mischief more than messages. Hardeep had wandered over on his break to confess a dream in which all the stanchions in the city had learned to walk away when people tried to line them up, which is a metaphor you can put in your pocket and carry for later. Mr. Li arrived at eleven with lychees in a plastic bag and the satisfaction of a man who had gotten three small things to do as they were told and forgiven a fourth for not. We read a flyer together that had colonized the corkboard between dog-walker ads and piano lessons: ROAST ON THE GREEN: A NIGHT OF TRUTH AND LAUGHTER WITH SPECIAL GUESTS; CONSENT FORMS OPTIONAL, which is to say not optional at all, and the font had Brill\u2019s swagger in its swash and a production company\u2019s fingerprints all over its spine.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t un-host,\u201d Layla said, which is how she says the word boycott when the audience is children and aunties and the mall teenager who stares with that expression like you owe them the next plot twist and your inside pocket lint as interest. \u201cBut we can re-host. We can throw a thing next to their thing and teach the city not to go where their feet don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe feed the town before he serves dessert,\u201d Mr. Li said, and exactly three children who were building a castle out of damaged encyclopedias chorused, \u201cSoup,\u201d as if they had been waiting for their cue for weeks. Hardeep frowned the way only a municipal worker with a soul can frown and said he would see if he could find those portable bollards that make a space feel like someone whispered \u201cbehave\u201d in its ear. I suggested we build a tent that says BOAST & TOAST and sell nothing and pour tea and ask people for their best thing of the week, which is not a joke and not a confession and not something cameras can use without getting their mouths sweet and sticky. Layla nodded and wrote rules on the back of a discarded Smiley Face poster so the Smiley looked like it had opinions about ethics, and she wrote: brag about yourself without stepping on a throat; listen until you can repeat someone else\u2019s sentence correctly; no punches, no punchlines, no punching down.\n\nThe ring behind the fence had grown suspicious enough of my good mood to hiss a little when I passed, and the fence blinked the slow blink of furniture learning not to be furniture. Auntie Bellflower was not on her mushroom, which means she was either saving a creek from a culvert or stringing a thread between two lovers too proud to ask for it. An uncle with a beard like a thistle and the eyes of someone who knows where all the basement doors are sat with his shoes off, toes in the wrong clover, and he acknowledged me by not ignoring me, which in our family is fondness in its wool sweater. He tilted his head and considered the way I was standing on my own shadow and asked if I had eaten anything more substantial than opinions. I said I had chewed a headline until it tasted like cardboard and he sighed as if we were discussing my calcium intake. When I told him about the roast and the green and the consent forms that thought they were gentlemen, he shrugged in the resigned style of men who have seen jokes break kingdoms and shoestring budgets alike.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t braid a whip out of laughter and then be surprised when it finds someone\u2019s back,\u201d he said, and I told him he was late with his poetry and we had already made signs. He inspected my bag, which is nosy and rude but permitted under the statute that reads: uncles rummage; nieces steal; aunties pretend not to notice. When his fingers found the whisker key, it shivered like a greyhound that has learned the meaning of a doorbell, and he grunted approval, which is as close as an uncle gets to bless you unless you\u2019ve lost a finger. \u201cYou are about to do something you will be praised for and then blamed for and then forgotten for until someone needs you in a hurry,\u201d he said, and that is prophecy when it comes from a mouth that has chewed nettles.\n\n\u201cI could use a trick,\u201d I said, which is how we say please in my line, because the words that get used too often wear holes in them and look indecent. He scratched his beard and arranged his face into a map and taught me a thing you do with your hands when you want to be smaller without being less, a letting-out of seams that does not change your size but changes how the world sits on you. \u201cTry wearing your paws on the inside,\u201d he said, and when I rolled my eyes at him he did something impossible and meowed at a pitch you only hear in alleys and rings. The wrong clover shook itself, which is how it laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been on all fours,\u201d he said, which is not true if you consider childhood, but true if you consider the habit I\u2019d made of standing for other people.\n\nI did not say yes to being a kitten and handed to someone I could not predict; I have enough sense left to dose my curiosity with a dropper. I said yes to a pawfast, is what he called it: an afternoon with the edges of me fluffed and my joints convinced they could turn both ways if they didn\u2019t hesitate. I walked back through the gate with my dignity tucked under one arm and my aftercare already an ache. The world did not tilt the way it does when you change size, because I did not. The world smelled louder, which is the thing you never remember to say when you tell stories about cats. The sawhorse on the sidewalk had a maple\u2019s breath on it and the bus shelter had sighed so often it had learned a human tone, and every child had a voice around their laughter that said I have eaten something sweet and hope I will not be scolded.\n\nNo one petted me because I wear the shape of a woman who can turn men to kittens in a blink, and people in this town are learning not to touch even when they want to, and the discipline sits beautifully on them and will look even better when it stops being a novelty. What happened was stranger and less showy: the edges of everything softened in me. The part of me that flinches when I hear cutlery chime in a way that forecasts cruelty did not flinch. The part that gets impatient with waiting in line because I can hear how tired the cashier\u2019s feet are decided to be bored in a kind way, a pocket-sized boredom that does not make the air crack. With the paws on the inside, everyone looked newly edible and newly sacred, which is a dangerous mood and one I did not wear for longer than it took me to buy milk and carry it without drinking out of the carton. It was, perhaps, the best rehearsal I could have asked for in a city that would soon be asked to treat cruelty as content again.\n\nBy afternoon the town\u2019s nervous system had been salted with something Brill had taught it, and the bus bell had learned to deliver rimshots, and the cash register at the drugstore had started pronouncing totals in a voice that was a little too smug, and a pair of benches by the fountain had taken to giggling when teenagers sat on them, which made the teenagers feel seen in the wrong register and get loud in the wrong direction. My copper wire went where copper likes to go, under bolts and along sills and in pockets where electricity thinks it is safe from aunties and uncles. I un-taught the benches to titter by telling them a very boring story about waiting rooms and the way chairs who do their jobs correctly get thanked with no notice, and I made the bus bell find the note that means we have arrived and not the one that means someone is about to say something mean, and the cashier\u2014who had been braced for people to perform for a breaker box\u2014exhaled into her sleeve and belonged to herself for at least the next five minutes.\n\nBy sunset the green was a mouth and the stage was a tongue, and the speakers looked like teeth, and this is why I prefer ponds and band shells and those half-constructed amphitheaters where a town keeps meaning to make music and runs out of budget. LaughLines had built a rig that could lift five jokes and lower five reputations simultaneously, and the stanchions had been set to allow for people to leave but to feel sheepish about it, which is a spell even when it\u2019s just rope on metal posts. We placed our tent three trees over, where a grandmother\u2019s shadow had always lived, and strung it with paper lanterns that glowed the color of almost-ripe peaches, and the sign read BOAST & TOAST in letters that had been to preschool and learned to share. Layla had put out the Rules next to a basket of markers and the markers had recorded a dozen children teaching each other to draw stars without lifting the tip, which is a curriculum any school should adopt.\n\nThe brass warmed their lips in a corner and looked like they were telling their instruments secrets they\u2019d promised to see safely home. Mr. Li set the thermos on a crate painted blue and poured out tea as if that were the only thing anyone needed, and the citizens of a town that tries to be modest and sometimes succeeds approached the tent like they had never been allowed before to brag without hurting anything. I opened the mirror and faced it down on the table like a fox sleeping, and set the bowl where cats could find it and where children could see that this was not a trick but a kind of altar. Hardeep moved through the crowd like a person dreaming of being useful and finding he was awake. I watched people try to laugh at the roast stage and discover their mouths did not want to open that way, which is a lesson and a miracle and a credit to months of practice no one put on a calendar.\n\nBrill took the stage like a man who has finally found a suit that fits him both standing and sitting, and his smile was an apology to the air for what he was about to do with it. He brought comics who had flown in and worn their jet lag like a crown and were spoiling for a fight with any town that thinks it loves itself. He asked for our worst selves and the audience did what he trained them to do in other places: they participated, because we have taught ourselves that participation is the form kindness takes in a busy world. He asked for my name and the green said it in the two wrong ways and the right way, and the right way sounded like a kettle catching, and he took it and balanced it on his tongue like a coin he might swallow with the flourish of a bad magician. He told a line about a woman who turns men into kittens to get out of arguments, which is a joke anyone can write if they refuse to look at the parts of an argument that cannot be solved by claws.\n\nI could have made him stop, right there, with the softest push. I could have tied the punchlines into bows and handed them back to their owners with a smile that said please do not. I did not. I stepped up onto the green\u2019s lip and I told the third strand in the shape it deserved, no names and all edges, because the Law likes to be fed properly and because the roast audience had come fasting and thought their hunger made them noble. When I said I had turned a friend soft in public when she needed to crack the air with her full bald fury and that I had stolen her moment to be seen as dangerous by being tender instead, the far bench squeaked and then learned to be quiet. When I said I loved someone in ways that looked like help and were a way of keeping myself necessary, the man in the hotel suit looked at his phone as if it had begun to tell the truth. When I said I apologized to the air because the person does not owe me her forgiveness and I would not accept it as payment if she offered, Layla put her hand on the table and the paper lanterns gathered themselves and glowed steadier without anyone adjusting their strings.\n\nThe roast stage tried to turn it into a bit, and the bit found no foothold in a field where the grass had been taught the difference between bones and boneshed. It rained a little at that moment, because weather loves an act break, and the microphones did their little tinnitus dance and then healed. One of the visiting comics took a run at the kittens and found his feet on gravel, because you cannot step on something that has decided to be fluid, and another tried to sell us the truth as if it were a craft beer and the crowd remembered that truth is not a taste but a practice and went to our tent and wrote in marker \u201cI took a nap and it saved my life,\u201d and a stranger applauded because you must.\n\nIt would have been enough to leave it there\u2014the roast starving, the boast fed, the town making a decision that looked like a yawn and was actually a vow\u2014but there is an inertia to men like Brill and a kindness to me that makes me a little stupid, and those two forces meet like weather fronts over a small region that has learned to keep sandbags in the garage. He did the thing he promised in whispers and rehearsal spaces, not with the full apparatus of a show but with the intimacy he reserves for our worst impulses; he asked me again, in front of no one, with his mouth in the modest shape of consent, if I would let him turn me into what I make. He did not raise his eyebrows and he did not smirk, which is how I knew he was serious and how he knows to make me consider doing something reckless and honest.\n\nThe bridge at Hillcrest is a bridge only to teenagers; the rest of us call it a walkway. He found me there on the way to carrying the thermos back with Mr. Li\u2019s careful arm, and we stood in a wind tunnel that smelled faintly of cinnamon from the donut place and faintly of wet cement from the fact of being in a suburb that keeps rebuilding itself like a nervous habit. He said the word please as if it scrapes him, which is how I know he practices it in the mirror sometimes and hates what it does to his reflection. I touched my mirror to my own mouth and watched the no become smaller and more useful and less of a defense and more of a tool. He flinched and asked whether I was afraid of finding out what I hand people; I told him I am not afraid of tenderness but of addiction, and his face did the small honest wince of someone who recognizes their own species.\n\nHe left me with a joke folded into a consent form, which is his idea of romance and sabotage, and I folded it back and returned it to the woman at the clipboard, who had learned by then to staple every form to a copy of our Rules so that people who signed away their names at least took home a list of instructions for breathing. I went back to the green and watched a child teach another child to clap on two and four and saw a man stop himself from filming without asking because we had printed in blue sharpie, by hand, a sentence that said: all stories are owned by the mouths that tell them, and I watched it sink into his pocket like a coin worth keeping.\n\nAt home after, the houseplants had put their leaves exactly where they wanted them and were uninterested in my opinion, which is a stage of maturity we can all aspire to. The whisker key lay on its back and hummed at whatever frequency it uses when it is proud and sulky and impatient, and I set the burr next to it and threaded the spider web through two teeth until it looked like a harp for a very small ghost. I wrote a note to Auntie Bellflower that said I spent more truth than I had and still have credit and I hate you for making me enjoy that and also come over and take my mirror for a week because I should learn to look at people without needing it. The window wore the neighborhood in a shy brightness and the landlord\u2019s cat sprawled on the steps like a judge who had learned mercy was a job and not a hobby, and I slept with my hands open so that I would not wake up clutching anyone I had no right to hold.\n\nThe cameras came back the next night and found a town that had learned to ask before telling, and a boy who had taped our Rules to his skateboard and was riding in loops that made his parents nervous and his future less frightening, and a librarian who had taped the same Rules inside the Choice Reads display and added in smaller letters, as if to herself and us all: it is okay to leave in the middle. Brill sent me a picture of a milk ring around his mouth and the caption practice makes peril and I sent him a picture of my empty bowl in a sink full of suds and the caption practice makes dishes and he left it on read, which is a courtesy in our era and may count as truce. Hardeep emailed a draft bylaw with a note that said you didn\u2019t see this and it protects nothing and everything and makes filming require tea service, and I laughed in the way that feeds your body and does not nibble at your soul, and I said yes to the meeting because the Law likes paperwork dressed like affection.\n\nThere are other chapters ahead where I will do something small and be thanked too large, and nights when Brill will find a seam in an auntie I thought seamless and pull and I will have to put my hand there and ask for patience as a verb and not a trait. There is winter coming whether or not anyone wants it and the willow will need to be reminded that she is not responsible for the whole lake. There is a child practicing the timing on a joke that could break him or make him, and I will have to be there with a bowl and a mirror and the willingness to be told no. There is this town with its light industrial parks and its ponds and its generous garbage raccoons and its ambulatory stanchions and its sly bookshop sign, and I will seed oaks where I can and apologize to air when I cannot and make soup on nights when there is nothing else to do and invite the cats and hope the cameras are bored. I am not finished paying. He is not finished trying. Between us is the practiced laugh that doesn\u2019t hurt and the practiced no that doesn\u2019t punish, and the summer is longer than it looks if you nap in it correctly.Chapter Ten\n\nMorning ran its tongue along the edges of the town and tasted dust and berry. The used bookshop sign had decided to be USE OOKS for an hour and then changed its mind to YOU SEE OAKS, which made me want to plant something and apologize to the dirt in advance. The radio tried to sell me a mattress and a municipal consultation and then a woman\u2019s laugh came through my phone like a coin dropping from nowhere: a clip of me, framed like a specimen and captioned FAIRY DECLINES CUTENESS. Someone had cut my \u201cNot today\u201d and looped it so I sounded coy and precious in a way that would make me punch a wall if I liked drywall. The comments were what comments always are: hungry. There were requests that I kitten a boss and a husband and a judge. There were threats dressed as compliments asking what it would take to make me say yes. There were a few kind words from people who have found that saying no rescued their lives and they had been waiting to clap for someone who did it in public, and those I tried to save and not drink, because someone else might need them.\n\nI put the phone face down on the table and set the mirror on top of it so the glass would keep glass company and maybe they would teach each other a little humility. The whisker key rolled itself off the tea towel I had laid out as a stage and thunked its head against the bowl and made a noise like a small bell with an attitude. Layla texted: we need signs for tonight; also muffins, and I texted back: muffins first, ethics after, and she sent a picture of a child asleep inside a fort made of non-circulating atlases with a caption that read: good, because I\u2019ve been doing ethics since 8.\n\nAt the bakery the croissants were a rumor at the back and the front case was a sermon: plum galettes that made my mouth feel like it remembered orchards I have never harvested, sesame buns glossy with ambition, a sourdough that had split its crust laughing. The girl behind the counter had a ring on her thumb that made her look like she could open bottles with her smile, and I watched a man try to make a joke land on her like a tip. I slid into the space between the words and the way they wanted to go and said, lightly, \u201cThat one\u2019s tired,\u201d and he blinked and swapped out his script for a better one that involved please and exact change and a compliment about the bake that did not involve her body. I carried muffins like a rumor you want to spread carefully and told myself that the clip will be forgotten by dinner and then remembered again on a bus at midnight by someone who needed permission, and that has to be enough.\n\nThe board outside the library read STORY NIGHT: EVERYONE GETS A TURN, and under it Layla had chalked in a tiny, stubborn hand: no filming without asking, and under that someone had added: no asking without meaning it. Hardeep stood at the returns desk like a man who had to confess he loved being in a place where children are issued cards without their utility accounts attached, and he slid me a draft of a bylaw tucked under a newspaper like it was contraband. \u201cIt would be a pilot,\u201d he said, eyes on the door because he is good at being seen as boring, \u201cA requirement for public events to provide tea and quiet corners. Less a rule than a reminder that we are a people, not a feed.\u201d\n\n\u201cA tea clause,\u201d I said, and the joy of it hit me so hard I had to set the muffins down and put my hand on a shelf because my knees were weak. \u201cYou are making bureaucracy into a kind of auntie.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was either that or stanchions with feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do both later.\u201d He watched me the way municipal people watch everyone, like we are all moving parts he would prefer not to replace. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a hearing. He\u2019ll be there. He\u2019s good at making the word freedom sound like a novelty you haven\u2019t tried yet and public health sound like a prude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring soup and a metaphor,\u201d I said, and he winced because he knows the weaponized metaphor is basically how I set tables.\n\nThe hearing was scheduled in that room at City Hall with the chairs that have known sleeping people. The agenda wore a suit. There were names of companies that wanted the town to look like television and the names of clubs that wanted the town to keep its practice of badminton and grief. Auntie Bellflower didn\u2019t come, because she doesn\u2019t do meetings with recording devices unless she wants to be immortalized saying something about ditches that will make engineers blush for a century. An uncle was there in the back corner with the union jackets and the smell of coffee that has been boiled twice. A girl I know from the pond sat with a binder labeled \u201cEverything at Once\u201d and her hair in a braid like a rope she could climb up if someone pulled the room out from under her.\n\nBrill took a seat only when the camera had found one for him that would make his left side do that charming thing with his bone, and he put his phone on the table face up so we could all see that he was not checking his face. He wore a shirt so ordinary it felt like a disguise he couldn\u2019t quite carry off. When it was his turn to speak, he stood without using his hands, which is a neat trick that impresses audiences even if they don\u2019t know why. He talked about joy and risk as if they were vitamins, and he talked about danger as if it were jazz, and he said the word censorship in a way that made three people in row two sit up and change their minds twice.\n\nI waited. I stacked our muffins on a napkin and handed them down the row like contraband and community and watched at least two hearts soften enough to let a good argument in. When I spoke, I did not say his name because I am trying to teach myself that litanies are not binding contracts. I talked about laughter like a tool with settings, and about what we already do in this town when we put our mouths on the same moment. I told a story about a night when a brass band let a boy with grief in his elbows blow the air out of his lungs through their mouthpieces so his chest wouldn\u2019t crack. I talked about tea as infrastructure, and I made a case for quiet corners as emergency exits for souls and not for bodies, and I watched the chair of the meeting un-cross and re-cross her legs when she realized this could be a clause she could be proud of on her re-election brochure.\n\nBrill listened like a man taking notes in chalk on a wall that would wash in the rain. He flicked his gaze to the lens and back to me and put his hands together once, quietly, because he is not immune to an argument made well even if it is against what keeps his lights on. Hardeep\u2019s clause passed in the way most good things in a city pass: not because it was moving but because it was administratively easier than arguing for another hour in chairs built to break your resolve. We all applauded without standing; the town learned a new trick and we saved our knees.\n\nWe came out into a midday that looked like it could go either way. At the corner by the bakery the influencer inevitability had arrived. He had a ring light like a halo and sneakers that had never touched mud, and his mouth was so soft it could only be maintained by someone making apologies for it on rotation. He had bait for kittens\u2014flaky fish and the sound of the internet\u2014and he had a following like a school of fish that did not know the ocean from a tank. He had already coaxed four cats into sitting on his lap for the kind of love that gets counted. People had gathered because humans do when there is a lens and a promise that someone will be humiliated by the end.\n\nThe kittens smelled the trap and didn\u2019t mind, which is a cat\u2019s worst habit and sometimes mine. Kids squealed and adults arranged their faces into delight because the camera demanded they behave like hometowns on postcards. Then one of the cats tried to cross the street because love and attention are separate moods and the city is a mouth you can fall into in an instant. I set the bowl on the curb and the key against the lip and the chalk along the gutter, and I could feel the math of the road\u2019s cruelty starting to sum. Hardeep was there because he is there when you need a person with a vest and a plausible authority, and he stepped into the traffic with the posture of a yield sign. Mr. Li began to speak in the voice he uses for children who are behaving like floods, and somehow it reached everyone without being a shout. Layla made a human chain with three teenage boys who were bored until the work made them awake. The influencer kept filming like a man on a surfboard that has forgotten the ocean underneath.\n\nI pulled the copper loop out and let it lie on the asphalt like a coin under glass. It isn\u2019t magic exactly; it just suggests. It suggested to the cars that the corner was a loop and the drivers could not help seeing the space as round, not cutting it into parabolas with their urgency. The kittens came to the edge of that circle and sat because circles make sense to them. The children learned in a second what you teach over a summer in other places: how to stand with your knees soft, how to be a gate not a wall, how to send something small into safety without making it feel hunted. The influencer looked around for a villain and landed on me and did that thing with a jaw that says he has been told his anger is pretty. He said, into the stream, \u201cFairy tries to steal my content,\u201d which is the kind of sentence that makes me want to replace all words with porridge and let the town figure itself out without grammar for a year.\n\n\u201cYour content,\u201d I said, patient as kitchen tile. \u201cThese are citizens. This is not a zoo. This is a corner with cars and we would like it to stay a corner with cars and not blood. You can film from there if you also hold this,\u201d and I put a sign into his hands that Layla had conjured from thin air that read: ask before filming; ask before petting; ask before asking. He held it the way men hold their daughters\u2019 barrettes, like it would burn him, and then a double decker bus of embarrassment drove over his face at the exact speed it needed to, and he held it like a man told to carry his own groceries for once and discovering he had arms.\n\nA woman in a scrubs top and office shoes stepped forward and put the smallest kitten in the crook of her arm where, under a hundred cameras, it began to fall asleep because it had found a heartbeat it could trust, and I made a decision I had been avoiding: not to bend the man who had trapped them into softness myself. I had wanted to. I had wanted to take his chin and tilt it until he felt foolish without me forcing him. I did nothing. I put my palm flat against the influence and told it: matte, and it turned itself down a notch and kept moving and it was enough.\n\nLater, when we thought the danger was over, a boy with a backpack that had a logo that made me suspect he had money and not the training to handle it walked away with a carrier that looked like it had potatoes in it and had three cats instead. He had the look of someone who does not yet know the difference between collecting and saving. I had to follow him because small lives were inside his cardboard morals and it was not the town\u2019s job to teach him on the street. Down a side lane that smelled like onions and betrayal, I called his name without knowing it and he turned because shock breaks the anonymities we layer over ourselves.\n\n\u201cOpen it,\u201d I said, a softness that would dent anyone. \u201cPlease.\u201d He shook his head and the hair in his eyes made him younger than his arrogance would allow. \u201cI need the content,\u201d he said, and I thought of the day I had decided to make a habit of kindness and remembered that acquiring anything this way is a theft even if it makes you famous. I took the whisker key out and did something I had never tried in public in this register: I touched it to the idea of the latch. The box understood, which is to say it ceased to pretend to be stronger than my decision. The flap came up in his hands and the kittens looked at me with that expression that means I am here because you said hello and the world answered with light.\n\n\u201cKeep the box,\u201d I said, because you always have to give a boy something to walk away with. \u201cPut your headphones in it. Put an orange cat plush in it and learn to say no to the part of your brain that wants live things to make you feel more real. If you come to story night, I\u2019ll give you the microphone for five minutes and you can say the truest thing you have, and then you can hold a kitten like a human and there will be no cameras on and it will be better.\u201d He flushed and tried to make it look like anger and then like scorn and then like permission and finally he stumbled into grace. He left the box and its particular music of claws and cardboard on the ground and ran like a boy who has discovered his legs work.\n\nBrill escalated the way he does when spectacle fails: he got quiet. Phones began to vibrate at the same minute like birds coming out of a bush. The notifications were all in the exact same tone, that little adorable trill that tells you a friend has liked you into being for one more day. \u201clol?\u201d they said, in that punctuationless way that lets you put the guilt in if you want to, lets you put the venom in if you want to, lets you put your spare time into someone else\u2019s pocket without knowing what you have bought. People looked down at their hands as if their hands had betrayed them, and the air went tight and thin.\n\nLayla is a librarian and therefore a general, and she did not wait for my plan or for anyone\u2019s permission. She had stocked the desk with stickers for summer reading that said DO NOT DISTURB ME I AM BUSY BECOMING and she began to pass them out to anyone who walked by and any screen she could reach. The camera boy, whose face is an open door more days than it should be, went up to the second floor of the mall and unplugged the thing that was shiny and loud and told people he was doing a test, and the supervisors let him because they are human and bored. Hardeep sent round an email that said the city was running a quiet hour as part of its new Tea Clause awareness and if employees wanted to participate they could, and ten percent did and twenty percent pretended and thirty percent wished they had, and that is a start.\n\nI walked the thin places with the whisker key rattling like a coin in a prayer jar. At the router in the back hall I told the fans to hum like humble things. On the corner where the bus always arrives a little late I chalked a line and said on this side put your phone down. At the laundromat where the gossip spins faster than the machines, I put the copper loop on the counter and asked the woman whose kingdom this is to keep the volume of the world at neighbor and not at television. At the pond the fishermen sat and nodded like they had heard DMs hum in their pockets and had decided to be men whose attention could not be bought by dopamine in a sweater.\n\nBy evening, the town had succeeded at being less interesting than an appetite. Brill texted me a period. It was the most honest he has been all week. I sent back a comma, because I am rude and also because I am kind; the night needs a rest now and then.\n\nThe friend I had softened found me because tricks have a half-life and so do apologies. She had hair cut blunt and a jacket that says I have lived through weather. We went to the patch behind the band shell and sat on the short wall because chairs make speeches and stone makes confessions, and she told me with precision what I had taken from her the day I turned her into what she was not for the convenience of my conscience. She put her hands on her knees and kept her voice inside the legal limit and it still cut and I did not bandage it with jokes or with kittens or with the lie that I did not know what I had been doing when I did it. She said the word forgive without making a sentence out of it and I put my mouth around no, not yet, and she nodded because she does not owe me her smooth.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want when it happens again,\u201d I asked, because this is what I can learn and it is the only thing that will make me less of a hazard to the people I love. She looked at the bench where sleeps happen and anger also and said, \u201cAsk me first. Stand next to me, not in front. If you must, make me sharp, not soft. Remind me where to put the edge so that it cuts the cord I want cut and not my own fingers.\u201d I gave her the copper loop because there are things that handle lightning better than flesh, and she put it around her wrist like a decoration and a safety and we walked home as if we were friends and not a fairy and her error.\n\nA notice went up on the corkboard the next day with craft-knife precision and cheap staples that bite: KINDNESS PAGEANT: JUDGES ON SITE, PRIZES FOR SMALL ACTS, and my throat closed around the words until they tasted like irony. You cannot rate tenderness without making it into a weapon. You cannot rank kindness without teaching an audience to expect kindness like room service. He had scheduled it for the plaza by the skating rink where teenagers learn physics via bruises in winter and grandparents teach toddlers how to be pleased by small circles in summer. He had booked a pair of celebrities whose faces made people pay attention and whose souls I hoped were anywhere else. He had put out a call for nominations, which is to say he asked people to tattle on their own goodness and on other people\u2019s debts.\n\nI saw what he wanted: he wanted to make us tired of ourselves. We had been practicing the art of being decent in public for days, and it is exhausting if you don\u2019t feed it right. He wanted to turn our habit into theatre and our theatre into content and our content into a reason to be cruel again because we were sick of our halo. I do not have enough power to cancel a spectacle. I have enough to reroute one so that when the current arrives it is ready to do something other than shock.\n\nI made the hardest choice I have had to make since I walked out onto the lake and played chicken with the habits of water. I decided to withhold. I told the aunties and uncles and the cats and, worse, myself: for three days there will be no kittening at all, not even the small acts that make a teenager stop from pushing someone into a fountain or a man stop from telling a joke that will ruin a woman\u2019s day. I said it as a vow into the bowl and the bowl was not pleased. It is like telling your spoon that you will not stir. It is like telling your lungs you will hold your breath while the town learns. It felt like cruelty and discipline and I hated myself for it and made soup so that my hands learned again that some labor is boring on purpose.\n\nThe first day people looked around for the trick and, not finding it, put their shoulders up and their eyebrows down; they bristled and did not bite. The second day was worse, because everyone had gotten used to the idea that softness would arrive when they were stupid and save their day for them like a coat someone else put over their shoulders in rain without asking. The third day the town remembered it had its own tools. Hardeep moved stanchions not to separate but to demonstrate correct distance, and people learned to mirror it without feeling corralled. Layla made a sign that said TAKE THE MICROPHONE BEFORE YOU REGRET NOT DOING SO and nine women used it in the first hour and each of them did not need me, which is the sentence that keeps me awake and lets me sleep. Mr. Li taught a child to dump an entire argument into a thermos and shake it and pour it out as tea and then decide whether to drink it; the metaphor did what metaphors do when they are fed and went home with that family to be used at a kitchen table until it became both joke and law.\n\nThe pageant tried to make kindness a costume and the town wore sensible shoes. Men with clipboards asked for nomination forms and were handed recipes and babysitting lists and the name of a locksmith who undercharges single mothers. The celebrity judges stood on a stage like saints at a parade and realized they were in a town that had learned not to treat them as altars. Brill saw it. He is vain and he is not stupid. He watched my quiet, and he watched how quickly the town learned that my quiet was not punishment but pedagogy, and it made him angry with the ferocity of a man who has discovered that someone else gets to be the season for a while. He took the microphone and made a joke about bureaucrats with tea kettles that should have landed like a clap and landed like a dropped spoon. He said, \u201cWhere is our fairy,\u201d and people did not look at me because I had chosen a place to stand in the exact center of the crowd and be uninteresting. He asked me quietly, almost kindly, in the space between a child reciting her best thing\u2014I returned my neighbor\u2019s Tupperware, I washed it first\u2014and a teenager telling us the worst thing\u2014when my friend lied about me I wanted to die and then I wanted her to\u2014and I shook my head with the mirror in my pocket so that the no could ring inside me and not bruise anyone.\n\nThe pageant ended with a brass band doing something complicated with a song that didn\u2019t deserve it, and with the celebrity judges putting their faces on the tea clause and making a small video about civic kindness that might, ironically and finally, do some good. People went home with an aftertaste of labor and not of performance. The kittens came back the day after my vow ended, which is to say they had stayed away without sulking, which is a grace I did not think I would ever be able to ask of anything. They came with a look like inspectors and rubbed against the ankles of men who had been brave without wanting to be and women who had been honest with strangers and children who had left their phones face down for an hour because the stickers told them it might make them into humans. I poured milk into the bowl with a relief that made my hands shake and then steady.\n\nThat night I dreamt that the city had grown fur inside its walls and purred when we did something that would have made a worse town hiss. I dreamt of Brill with a bowl and of him drinking and not choking and of him, for once, not performing his swallow. I woke to the sound of a municipal truck breathing outside and my landlord\u2019s cat trying to tell me that the water notice had become a filming notice again and that our block was about to be asked to perform being itself. The whisker key hummed in a key I had not heard before, a minor thing with teeth in it, and the burr on my sill had caught a spider that was more geometry than aggression and had built a net that would not catch anything except relief. I made coffee and put the bill back in my mouth and found it smaller again, like a coin you thumb when you need to remember that money exists but is not a god.\n\nBy lunch, the clip of me saying soup had become a meme and a local deli had put up a chalkboard that read TODAY\u2019S SOUP: BRAVE LAUGHTER, and then in smaller chalk under it: we\u2019re working on the recipe, please be patient. The used bookshop sign had finally laid down and let its pieces be letters on the sidewalk, and a kid knelt and turned them like puzzle tiles into YOU OAKS SEE US, and he laughed like he had invented something. The town had put its paws on the inside and learned to be gentle without my hands on its head, and I will be paying for that quiet for a while with attention and with showing up, and it is the best debt I have ever let climb onto my back and ride. In the evening I walked to the bridge that only teenagers call a bridge and I held the mirror up to my own mouth again and said yes, just once, quietly, to the part of me that wants to be adored without labor, and then I said no, out loud, to the man hiding under the shadow of the walkway with a camera who thought he would catch me being sentimental. He lowered it, and I lowered the mirror, and the night came down like weather that can be handled if you have a coat and a friend and a thermos, and lucky me, I had all three.",

The traffic lights blinked their human semaphore; the jack pines whispered in a language that is older than any suburb. The sign for the used bookshop clicked, its O intermittently alive, so that it was U SED B OKS and then U SED BO KS and, briefly, US EDBOOKS\u2014like a spell trying to remember itself.\n\nI am a fairy. Not the kind that rustles out of graveyard stones with a harp and a tragic smile. I\u2019m the kind that learned to put quarters in parking meters and hold a door open at the dentist\u2019s because the hygienist was clearly overloaded. My ring\u2014the circle that raised me, that I slip back into when the grass glows and the sounds of the highway soften\u2014is behind a backyard fence in Richmond Hill, looks like trampled clover, and if you step into it without knowing to ask, it will borrow your name until you are clever enough to ask it back.\n\nMy name is Tamsin Reed. There have been other names. The one the railway line calls me is Silver Current. The one the raccoons call me cannot be translated without scraping up the throat. The one that matters tonight is the one my landlord spells wrong on the buzzer: Tamson.\n\nHe did it on purpose\u2014another layer of misdirection; I don\u2019t mind.\n\nI came out because of a feeling. The air had a cindery taste, laughter had gone metallic at the edges. Somewhere, too near for comfort, a bad joke was growing teeth.\n\nHe always arrives like that: a prickle, as if the city\u2019s neon nervous system were about to sneeze. First the laughter, then the hush, then the laughter again but with a warpy, barbed hook in it. I followed the sound past the bakery that stays open too late, past the bus shelter that catches more rain than it keeps off, to the patio of The Finch, where the umbrellas are all branded with a beer named after a province I have never put my feet in.\n\nThe Finch is not named for him, but it might as well be. Brill Grackle leaned against the rail like someone who had invented leaning. He is a fairy like me, but as a violin is like a hacksaw. Slung in denim, slick-smiled, eyes the color of that oily puddle sheen that makes children go oh. He was telling a story, and his hands\u2014their gestures\u2014were dangerous.\n\nHe tells jokes. He tells the kind that trip minds. In the old days he whispered into the ears of kings and dukes and shirtless shepherds, harmless now, you'd think, in a town with a good library and a bus schedule that sometimes works. Except you can do damage with jokes. He knows where the seams are.\n\n\u201c\u2026and then she says\u2014\u201d Brill broke off because he saw me. His grin went knife-sharp and then softened into something like affection. \u201cTammy-Tam,\u201d he said, welcoming, warning.\n\n\u201cTamsin,\u201d I said. \u201cNobody asked for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they did,\u201d he said, spreading his hands at his audience: a chemistry teacher, a man with a briefcase who pretended not to be listening, a cluster of young men drunk on being young and cheap IPA. \u201cThey asked with their boredom. I\u2019m the answer to that, darling. And I brought new material.\u201d\n\nHe had new material every time. He never told the same joke twice; he never had to. He could look at a scar and build a punchline around it, a punchline that opened like a hinge into whatever the person didn\u2019t want to show. And tonight he was performing for the patio but also for me. He kept throwing me those sideways glances, those if-you\u2019re-so-good-come-stop-me looks.\n\nI could have. I have a knack that isn\u2019t fair; it isn\u2019t anything. It\u2019s just what I am: I can turn anybody into a kitten.\n\nI have turned a judge into a kitten once, for twenty-seven minutes; he was heavenly soft and so very small, and he purred in a frequency that I still hear when I am too tired to sleep. I turned a bus driver into a kitten when he was about to punch another bus driver for calling his mother a rude noun; they both wrestled gently on the seat while I drove their route, which yes, was excessive, but no one got hurt, and the passengers were very patient when I missed Steeles and had to double back. I turned my landlord into a kitten for exactly one breath when he said I was a month late on rent and I wasn\u2019t. He apologized for the error and we pretended not to notice the yellow fur on his shoulder.\n\nI could have turned Brill into a kitten. I didn\u2019t, because he would not have stayed kitten-shaped; he would have clawed his way out of the spell and also because I am not supposed to use that on our own kind. There is Law. It is slippery and moss-edged, but it is real, and I keep it when I can.\n\nHe started again. His voice is a good voice, I\u2019ll give him that. He spoke softly so people leaned in. The punchline came like a goose walking on ice. There was laughter, that was laughter, then there were faces turning into gates\u2014open, too open, nothing behind the eyes. He had pushed the joke too far and they had followed him. He went further. The joke got... worse. Not violent. Not illegal. Not something I\u2019ll repeat.\n\nA girl in a red shirt put her hand over her mouth and was laughing and crying at the same time. The chemistry teacher\u2019s cheeks burned. Someone dropped a glass. Brill\u2019s teeth flashed.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cTamsin,\u201d he crooned, not looking at me. \u201cDon\u2019t be dull.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand why you don\u2019t talk to our aunties anymore,\u201d I said. \u201cBut do you understand how thin this is? The skin between world and hey-whoops? Stop it.\u201d\n\nHe tapped the rail with his knuckles, tat-tat-tat, and told one more line. His laughter found the bit of you that thinks you are a worse person than you present and pressed on it. People laughed as if they were apologizing to the air.\n\nThe girl in red stood. Her chair scraped. One of the beer-blooming young men reached to tug the edge of her shirt like he didn\u2019t have a mother. I sighed. I felt the familiar rush in my fingers.\n\nKitten.\n\nThe young man blinked. His hands were suddenly soft-padded, his expression a perfect small question. He sat. His friends made seals of themselves, flapping and hooting. The girl stared, then scooped him\u2014no, him, not a cat, never a cat entirely\u2014into her arms by instinct and said what you say to a sudden kitten: \u201cOh my God.\u201d She stroked behind his ears. He went boneless with simple bliss, the joke dropping out of him like a nail from rotten wood.\n\n\u201cDirty pool,\u201d Brill murmured. \u201cYou always did prefer soft answers.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always did like hard ones,\u201d I said. I walked onto the patio and without touching anyone touched their attention. \u201cHey,\u201d I said, lightly. \u201cThis is a funny fairy, he tells jokes, but he sometimes forgets to bring consent to the table. Laugh if you want to. Don\u2019t if you don\u2019t. This is me pressing the reset button. Ha-ha.\u201d\n\nThe air wobbled and bumped back into alignment. Someone coughed. The man with the briefcase stared at me and then at the kitten, which I was not going to let remain a kitten for more than a minute because there\u2019s an ethical calculus to this that I am not terrible at. Still, I did my terrible little trick again. Softened him. Kittened a second boy who was winding up to say something you can\u2019t say. He shrank; his anger shrank with him.\n\nBrill\u2019s smile did a slow handstand, then righted itself. \u201cOh, Tamson,\u201d he said, deliberately, a needle in it. \u201cFrom the Hill. Loves her little cats. Does tricks. Fetches slippers and brings them to the party.\u201d\n\nThat wasn\u2019t a joke, really. That was a brute fact disguised as insult. I have always lived here, or always enough. The old rings knew me; the new restaurants did, too. I was one of those fairies that stayed when the others bored themselves back into lakes and cigarette smoke. It gives a person a reputation.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d I told him, and felt the brushing, like crows feathering over my scalp, of other eyes. Our aunties look at us when we do things. Our uncles don't look but listen. There are not so many of us that we can afford to ignore each other.\n\nHe took a breath. He could have dug in\u2014turned mean, turned nasty, turned the whole patio into a chorus of sheepish cruelty. He didn\u2019t. He tipped two fingers like a hat. \u201cLater,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll wish you\u2019d come to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlikely,\u201d I said.\n\nHe hopped the railing like gravity was a suggestion and strolled north into slick blue. The sound of his footfalls was like someone synching a metronome to your heartbeat and then wobbling it off.\n\nThe young men turned back at the same time to being men. One\u2014kitten number one\u2014scruffed the back of his neck, bleated a laugh, tried for embarrassment like it was a jacket he hadn\u2019t worn in a while. \u201cWhat was that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou were rude,\u201d the girl in red said, excellent, crisp. She fixed him with a look that someday will level buildings. \u201cShe saved you from being worse. Say thank you.\u201d\n\nHe looked at me. \u201cThanks,\u201d he muttered. \u201cSorry, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s summer. The moon makes fools of everybody.\u201d I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, but it sounded right. I paid the bar back for the broken glass, which was a coin each to the two students washing dishes in the back, because it isn\u2019t the same as paying, but it covers some things money can\u2019t.\n\nWhen I step back out onto the sidewalk, the world resumed its rich, complicated hum. A bus coughed. A bicycle whispered past like a long-limbed insect, bells half-hearted as a yawn. Someone\u2019s radio played a song from before I was born that I know the chords to\u2014because there are only so many chords and we arrange them in endless ways.\n\nLayla was waiting under the birch just beyond the sushi place. She raised both eyebrows at me, and her shoulders read: So? and Well? Layla knows my business. She is human with a capital H and a minor in Secrets. I met her when she was fourteen and talked to the squirrels because her house was noisy with other people\u2019s arguments; she is twenty-seven now and runs the children\u2019s section at the library as if it were a frontier post in a war against blandness.\n\n\u201cYou care too much,\u201d she said. It wasn\u2019t unkind.\n\n\u201cI care as much as it takes,\u201d I said. \u201cHe was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI figured,\u201d she said. \u201cA kid came in earlier and tried to check out a book we don\u2019t carry by making a joke. It kind of worked? I found a copy of it in the storage closet. Not normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cClever boy,\u201d I said. Brill can make desire heavy enough to pull things into your hands. Not conjuring, exactly, just a sleight that shimmies the shelves. \u201cDon\u2019t let him work the early readers into learning rude words.\u201d\n\nShe smiled, a quick glint. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said. She put her hand on my sleeve. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m annoyed,\u201d I said. \u201cHe keeps coming closer. Like he\u2019s testing the fence.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no fence,\u201d Layla said. \u201cNot for him.\u201d\n\nFair. He had never respected lines. But there are other kinds of fences. Geography. Ritual. The rhythms that become familiar and guard as much as they bind. Richmond Hill is something like a lullaby to me: the way the sky opens over the plazas, the water hum from Mill Pond, the chatter around the soccer fields where the kids are better than they think. All of that is a net that keeps me from falling.\n\nWe walked south together. Layla\u2019s keychain chimed. The sky was a heat-bruise. \u201cHe\u2019s planning something,\u201d I said. \u201cI can feel it the way you can feel that the streetlights are about to buzz on.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMidsummer,\u201d I said. \u201cAt the parade, probably.\u201d\n\nShe made a face. \u201cThat\u2019s three nights away. Will he wait?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll pretend to,\u201d I said. \u201cHe\u2019ll poke between now and then to see where it itches.\u201d\n\nShe said: \u201cSo shampoo the city?\u201d\n\nI laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d\n\nWe walked. The world felt tipped, like a cup about to spill. Somewhere a spoon fell. The wind had fallen asleep and the maples were waiting for the night to comb their hair.\n\nI took Layla home. Her apartment above the tailor smells like wool steam and old books. On her fridge, magnets shaped like punctuation marks are arranged so that it reads, by accident or design: ! ! ? and I approve. She put on a kettle and I sat in her chair by the window and listened to the building talk to itself through the pipes.\n\n\u201cYou could ask the aunties to help,\u201d she said at last.\n\n\u201cAnd what would they say?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be personal,\u201d she said. \u201cAsk. They might say yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey might take over,\u201d I said. \u201cThey might say stop being kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cKindness isn\u2019t your weakness,\u201d she said, gently.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a habit, though,\u201d I said. \u201cHabits and weaknesses look the same at a distance.\u201d\n\nWe drank tea. We told each other gently ridiculous stories from the day\u2014two kids pretending the stacks were caves, Mr. Li the retired astronomer holding court at the park bench describing comet tails as if he had combed them himself, the family at the bus stop speaking three languages and laughing in a fourth. The small, steady good things are a kind of magic that doesn\u2019t show up in any of our books. But they build the floor you fight on.\n\nAfter midnight I went home. The mosquitoes wanted me, but I am inedible when I\u2019m annoyed. My building is brick that thinks it's a tree: it picks up squirrels and keeps them, it drops leaves in the hallways sometimes. On the second landing my landlord\u2019s cat, who is not my doing, eyed me with deep suspicion for reasons of her own. My door stuck in the summer. I sang it open.\n\nInside, my apartment exhaled, same as me. There is a rug. There are the old postcards I send myself when I leave and return every time, to make coming and going a game rather than an ache. There is the shelf that holds the whisker key.\n\nThe whisker key is exactly what it sounds like: a key, made of six whiskers braided, lacquered with something that is not sap and not resin, handles a little cold, teeth sharp as noon. It opens things that are too stubborn for any other tool. I once saw it open the idea of a door. The aunties gifted it to me when I bound my trick, when I declared what I was, when I became\u2014reluctantly and maybe forever\u2014The One With The Kittens. It was important to have a tool that wasn\u2019t one trick only. They have their moods, those aunties. Sometimes they hand you a skein of shadow and say here, knit. Sometimes they hand you a whisker key and it saves your life.\n\nI took it down and held it. It hummed like a tuning fork. It was either ready or simply alive. I put it in my bag.\n\nI also packed: three chalks (white, coral, and twilight), a loop of copper wire, the length of thread I had pulled from my own dress when I saved a boy in winter from turning himself into a story, two pennies, a piece of frit glass from a church window, a bow I did not know how to use (hopeful, I guess), and a cat toy shaped like a sardine that some part of me considered a talisman. I left the houseplants a note: Back soon. Water yourselves judiciously. \u2013T.\n\nSleep would not come. I listened to the slow tick of someone else\u2019s clock through a wall. I thought of Brill\u2019s voice cutting into rooms and making them laugh despite themselves. He calls that freedom. He is wrong, but he believes it, and that makes him fearless. I thought of all the ways a joke works like a spell and all the ways it doesn\u2019t. A joke, it turns out, is a ladder: you climb it and then throw it away. He builds ladders over places we have put a lot of effort into not falling.\n\nWhen dawn came on a moth wing, I put my face in the frost of the freezer and breathed in cold air until my thoughts stopped shimmering. Then I went to see Auntie Bellflower.\n\nYou find Auntie Bellflower by not looking for her. The backyard is a backyard, the fence a fence. The mulberry tree leans, and there is a swing, and there is a patch of wrong clover that makes the light taste sweet. You knock on the fence twice, then twice again, then once. The fence opens an eye. If it likes you, it winks. If it doesn\u2019t, it tells you a story and you forget your name for an hour. I am liked, which is not the same thing as being welcome, but suffices.\n\nInside the ring, everything is taller. The grass reaches my knees. The dandelions exchange straws. The wind speaks with etiquette. Auntie Bellflower sat on a mushroom that had never known a boot, plucking a harp made of minute bones. Her hair was the color of words you aren\u2019t supposed to say to your grandmother. She looked up.\n\n\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t Tamsin,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it isn\u2019t Richmond Hill\u2019s civil servant without a salary.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that as if it were a profession,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d she said. \u201cWe used to call it being harmless. We used to call it doing no harm. We used to be worse at it than you are.\u201d She cocked her head. \u201cYou smell like engine noise and bad timing. What did he do?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told jokes,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s his only trick and his sharpest spear. Your trick is softer but it leaves marks too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said. \u201cI make choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always did,\u201d she said. She put the harp down on her lap. \u201cBrill is playing with you. It is not that he doesn\u2019t have other projects; he always has other. But you are a string he can pluck and get a note that pleases him. You two have this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not a we,\u201d I said too fast.\n\n\u201cYou are an opposition,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is a kind of we.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to use Midsummer,\u201d I said. \u201cHe wants a spectacle. He\u2019ll take the parade and stretch it until it breaks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will try to sing shame into chorus,\u201d Auntie Bellflower said. \u201cHe is very good at it. He always has been.\u201d\n\n\u201cHelp me,\u201d I said. \u201cDon\u2019t stop me. Just help me a little.\u201d\n\nShe looked past me into the ring\u2019s brighter place, the place with the whistlelines and spider-cranes raising webs like bridges. \u201cI have so many nieces and nephews,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think I can make choices for all of you? I am not a manager, Tamsin. I am not a god.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re better than both,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd anyway, you love me best.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, a slanting sound that tasted of honey and burnt sugar, which is to say complicated. \u201cBring your whisker key,\u201d she said. \u201cBring your copper and your chalk. Bring a mirror you can see yourself in even when you\u2019re not looking, and a bowl of milk.\u201d\n\n\u201cMilk,\u201d I said. \u201cAuntie, that is a clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d she said, all gravity. \u201cYou always get stuck on the parts of the old stuff that are silly. Sometimes the silly parts are the bones. Milk. Enough for a kitten, you understand? There will be one. Maybe a thousand. Who can say.\u201d\n\nI hated her for being right and being vague. \u201cAnd a mirror?\u201d\n\n\u201cHold a joke in front of a mirror and watch it flinch,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will hate that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll break it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThen he\u2019ll get seven years of some kind of trouble,\u201d she said calmly. \u201cIt has to be that way for someone. Better for him than for you.\u201d\n\nThe sun moved in a way suns do not for humans and I stood, my legs full of pins and needles because time here prickles. \u201cWill you stand with me?\u201d I asked, too quickly. Too small.\n\nShe looked at me with the soft part of her eyes, the side that sometimes still remembers my baby face and the way I would stare at the ceiling fan and clap as if it were a clock. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot. I shouldn\u2019t. This is your fight. It is your patch. He chose your stage.\u201d\n\nI nodded. I left the ring, which closed behind me like a mouth over a peach. The mulberry leaves said some very inappropriate things to me as I went; I pretended not to hear.\n\nThe city was happening. It always is. Moms carted strollers as if they were little ships in high wind. The joggers did their self-flagellating thing. The dog people met the other dog people, telegraphing complicated messages with leash hand gestures and scoops. I went to Mr. Li\u2019s and told him his tomatoes were about to be ambushed by hornworms and told the hornworms to try the basil instead, and then I felt him. Again, already.\n\nThis time he had found the schoolyard where the fence is missing three slats and the shade sits at the perfect angle for the bench. He had a small crowd: two teens with shaved kewpie curls, a woman who wore her grief like a jaguar on a leash, the man who sells phone plans in the kiosk and sells jokes if you press him. Brill balanced on the top rail of the fence, examining his nails, and every so often he spoke and the crowd rippled.\n\n\u201cBrill,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cTamsin,\u201d he said, bored. \u201cI am trying quieter material. Intimate stuff.\u201d He stretched his legs as if to show that he could, and wasn\u2019t that a wonder.\n\n\u201cWhisper it into your coat,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t own silence,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one does.\u201d\n\n\u201cSilence is rented like everything else,\u201d I said. \u201cYou pay for it with attention. And you, sir, never pay.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere would you like me to begin? The list of my vices? The case for my defense?\u201d He hopped down. \u201cYou muzzled me last night. That wasn\u2019t bad. The boys purring on their friends\u2019 laps. Good television. But I have to say\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, because what came next would be lewd and it would hurt someone who didn\u2019t come here to be hurt. He said it anyway. A clean, brutal line. The woman with the jaguar-grief laughed, then bit her tongue so hard I think it bled. Brill watched her as if she were an experiment.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d I said, again.\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d he said, wide-eyed. \u201cIt is always that with you. Enough. As if the world had an ideal gentle median where people keep hands to themselves and their thoughts sifted like flour and their mouths sweet with the little lies that keep an afternoon from tearing. I love you for it. I do. It\u2019s not for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to be like me,\u201d I said. \u201cI need you to not pull people into your current without a lifejacket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a lifejacket,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I pull them out of waters you don\u2019t see. They find out things and laugh until they get air back. That\u2019s what a joke is. That\u2019s what I am.\u201d\n\nI reached and drew a line with chalk between his shoes. \u201cHere,\u201d I said. \u201cPerform this way. Away from them.\u201d\n\nHe looked down at the chalk line and then looked up, and I realized he had wanted me to make a move that would let him move more. He stepped back deliberately over my line and told a small story about a busker, a cop, and a bouquet of gerberas, and the story clicked with the exact wrong part of the woman with jaguar-grief. She went still. Not calm. Not ready. Still like a mouse when the shadow passes overhead.\n\nI sighed that sigh. Even my sighs have muscle memory. Kitten. He\u2019d picked his audience well; there were no men itching for an excuse to be kittens. The two teens shrank and softened and looked surprised at their tails; the woman tipped her head at me, not a kitten, not even close. Not everyone can be, thank the greens. She looked at me as if a rope had loosened around her shoulders exactly one notch, and then she looked at Brill as if he were a bruise she would not be pressing again soon.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said to him. \u201cMidsummer is coming. Don\u2019t make me fight you with an entire town watching.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you wouldn\u2019t love it,\u201d he said, and that is the part where he was wrong. I like a private victory. I like quiet. I like the feeling of being the human variation while the loud things shake out their noise elsewhere. \u201cBring your milk and your mirror,\u201d he said, and this time it was like he\u2019d been listening to the fences, too. He knows almost everything that isn't his.\n\n\u201cYou first,\u201d I said.\n\nHe tipped his head at the teens, who were batting a bee back and forth with very round paws and tiny, murderous intent. He tipped his head at me. He tipped off the fence again and went, a breeze with a knife taped under its coat.\n\nLayla texted: Meeting in 20? I wrote back: Soon. Be careful.\n\nI brought milk home. Not for me. I am not that kind of fairy, not anymore. It is a ritual. Objects ask to be used the way they are meant to be; deny them that and you make a tangle. I poured the milk into a bowl so white it seemed to erase the counter under it, put the mirror on the kitchen table, a hand mirror with a fox engraved on the back that I stole and then paid for and then was permitted to keep by a woman who sees very clearly.\n\nI practiced. You can practice being terse; you can practice not explaining yourself beyond the point that affects the work. I drew circles with chalk on paper so I could throw the paper away, not litter the world with circles that might become doors. I set the whisker key down in a patch of sun so it would purr. I spoke the words that were not words at all: the rising humming vowels of Please and Now and You Stop, the clipped consonants of No More.\n\nI thought of kittens, their simple complete needs, their huge ridiculous paws. I thought of what I could do to Brill that wasn\u2019t cruel. I thought of what it would be to turn him kitten-soft, just for a second, to give him the feeling of being cherished without edges, and whether that would teach him what he refuses to learn. He would claw out at once. He would hate me. He would be himself again, sharper for the sanding.\n\nIt got hot. The whole town steamed. People who owned air conditioning blessed their ancestors; the rest of us perspired modestly or immodestly and let the night come.\n\nIt came scented with barbecue and grass, the far-off ring of a baseball bat, laughter that did not claw. I went to the pond and the fishermen who fish for stories nodded like we shared a route. Mr. Li waved me over and handed me an ice. \u201cThe moon is late,\u201d he said, as if that were up to it. \u201cI think it\u2019s trying another route.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell it to take Bathurst,\u201d I said. \u201cLess construction.\u201d\n\nWe sat. The frogs tuned up. Between and under everything was a vibration like a joke waiting to happen, like a curtain waiting to go up. I do not love that feeling. It asks and asks. It is a mouth.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Mr. Li said, and I told him the true part: that a fairy was bothering people in public, and that I was going to stop him in public. He nodded, like a man acknowledging a chess opening he\u2019d seen before. \u201cBring witnesses,\u201d he said. \u201cBring someone to laugh at the right place. It matters where laughter falls.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt does,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring Layla. She knows the beats. She knows how to not feed him.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can also,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI can try,\u201d I said.\n\nWe made arrangements without calling them that. The whole world is made of arrangements. You can walk through them like spiderwebs and pretend they aren\u2019t there, but then your cheek stings and your hands get sticky.\n\nTwo days. The parade swelled in the winter plans and sprang up in summer wood and cloth. Kids decorated wagons and then reluctantly let adults help. A brass band that was mostly broken but had three trumpets showed up. Paper lanterns hung careful as croissants. Layla built a booth with a sign that read: Read Out Loud and raised a stack of stories as if they were sandbags. I chalked invisible lines here and there that would slow things if they had to slow, and built a net you wouldn\u2019t notice, made of Yes You May and Please Step Aside and No Not You. The whisker key hummed in my pocket where I tucked it like a secret.\n\nBrill sent messengers, as if we were in a play. A crow dropped a strip of paper that read: don\u2019t wear yellow. A squirrel told me a filthy riddle that I will not repeat and got a cherry for his trouble. A cloud shaped like a mouth drizzled on me when I stood at the corner of Major Mackenzie and Yonge and three kids laughed and I laughed back, because weather has its own comedy.\n\nOn the morning of the thing, I rose early and fed the idea of courage with toast. I wore shoes I could run in. I left a note for the houseplants that said: forgive me. I tucked the mirror into its scarf and made the milk new and cold. I texted Layla: please be early, please bring your voice.\n\nAt the park, the day opened like a folding chair. People who had only ever been alone in their kitchens stood shoulder to shoulder and discovered they were friends. Auntie Bellflower didn\u2019t come, because she said she wouldn\u2019t, but there were others from the rings, disguised as the woman who sells kettle corn, as the old man napping under a hat, as the kid with a skateboarding T-shirt who never blinked. They were there because we are nosy. Also because we pretend not to be a community but we are. Also because our aunties do not do nothing; even when they do nothing they do it beautifully and with careful omissions.\n\nBrill came late. He came like the last course of a meal you\u2019re already full from but smell and think: oh, fine. He wore white, to spite the don\u2019t wear yellow note, and his shirt had a stain on it shaped like a map of a country that needed better water management. He didn\u2019t take a stage. He found an absence\u2014between the band and the bouncy castle, at the open lip of the pond\u2014and stepped into it as if he had paid for it.\n\nPeople noticed the way grass notices feet. This is how it happens when he is strong: no horns, no spotlight. Attention tips toward him like it has been waiting to pour. He didn\u2019t say his name. He didn\u2019t ask us to gather round. He told a small, precise story about a dad who lost his temper and then apologized, and because he could not be patient he laced it with a barb and everyone felt the barb and laughed to prove it didn\u2019t stick. It did. It always does. He went on.\n\nI didn\u2019t jump. I waited. I let him build his little rope bridge across the gorge. The thing with jokes is that they are navigation; they end where they mean to end. You must let them take you there. When he had brought the room\u2014field, pond, strollers, brass\u2014up to a simmer, when he had turned everyone into one animal with one breath, I stepped.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d I said, not loudly. I poured the milk into the white bowl that belonged to my grandmother. The air discharged like a storm thinking better of itself. Brill\u2019s eyes flicked to the bowl and then to the mirror and then to me. I had a moment to enjoy that.\n\n\u201cKitty Queen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cBard of Bad Timing,\u201d I said back, and saw several heads tilt at the word Bard like oh lovely.\n\nHe smiled. \u201cYou brought props.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always do,\u201d I said, and gestured at his mouth.\n\nPeople found that funny. He did not.\n\n\u201cThis is my town,\u201d I said\u2014to him and to everyone else. \u201cYou\u2019re a guest here if you\u2019re here at all. That means I get the right of reply. That means you do not get to say whatever you want and then pretend that \u2018just joking\u2019 is a spell that bleaches consequences. That means I will take your joke, and I will turn it around, and we will see what bites.\u201d\n\nHe swayed. \u201cYou can\u2019t reverse a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cYou break it if you try. It isn\u2019t a mirror. It\u2019s an arrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a boomerang,\u201d I said, and held up the mirror so it caught him, so for one split second he saw his own shape about to speak. He flinched. He smiled as if that were part of the routine. He tried to talk into the mirror. His voice skipped. The edge fell off the syllables like a knife losing its serration. He tried again.\n\n\u201cOnce,\u201d he began, and I heard the shift in the crowd: the hunger to hear the story, the hope it would be nice and the resilience if it was not. I placed the mirror against my chest and leaned it so that it showed the bowl of milk and then Brill\u2019s eyes. I took the whisker key out and set it delicately on the edge of the bowl. The sound it made was not a sound but everyone heard it in their teeth.\n\nHe blinked. \u201cWhat are you doing,\u201d he said, as if we had been sitting together with cups of tea and not knotted in a game that would call itself war if it had more honor.\n\n\u201cInterrupting,\u201d I said. \u201cPolitely.\u201d\n\n\u201cRude,\u201d he said, delighted, and then his delight hooked itself into the wrong angle because I let myself smile too. That cracked something between us. He saw what I would do and couldn\u2019t help wanting to see it done.\n\n\u201cSay it,\u201d I invited.\n\nHe said it. He said the first of his Midsummer lines, a tidy, cruel joke disguised as a kindness, with a parent at the center and a child at the edge and the sharp delight of doing wrong because someone says it\u2019s right. As the words left his mouth I put my hand between them and him and turned my hand once, twice, as if unscrewing a lid from a jar. I heard it. You hear it when I do it: a mew as clear as a bell.\n\nHis voice fell soft and small. It didn\u2019t stop being his voice, it just became gentle. He put his hand to his mouth, startled, and snatched it away as if he\u2019d been caught doing something private. He glared at me. He loved me for a heartbeat. Hated me for three.\n\n\u201cYou like humiliation,\u201d he said, too low for anyone else.\n\n\u201cI like the truth with claws out,\u201d I said. \u201cYours is not the only version.\u201d\n\nHe tried again. He reached for a deeper cut. He began a story about a woman who wanted the wrong things. I held the mirror up so he had to look at himself as he said it. I didn\u2019t make him a kitten because he would have broken my spell out of pure spite and bloodied himself on the edges. I did what Auntie said: I held the joke up to itself and watched it flinch.\n\nHe sneered, just a little. He stretched his nice mouth around the line that would have made twenty people here vulnerable, and he could not finish it. He huffed a laugh. \u201cYou\u2019re no fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet,\u201d I said. \u201cAsk around. I\u2019m the best fun.\u201d I let the crowd laugh and some of them did, a real good laugh, not the kind he sells. Layla\u2019s laugh, especially, rang pure, the laugh of someone who understands the structure of things and likes them anyway. Mr. Li put his hand over his heart and coughed, which is what he does when he places a check where he wants a checkmate to be.\n\nBrill took one step back. One step forward. Pleasure ran across his face and left it like someone wiping crumbs off a plate. \u201cWe could do this forever,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cwe couldn\u2019t,\u201d and I pushed. Not him. The world.\n\nThere are lines you can draw between breaths. There are circles you can make around laughter. There are nets you can cast that catch intention instead of fish. I had laid them all this morning because I had seen how he moves, and I set one gently under him now, and when he tried for his next joke, he slipped and fell through to the floor of himself.\n\nIt was a soft fall. I am not cruel. He stood in the bowl of milk up to his ankles and hissed like a displeased cat and realized he was not going to die from that feeling. The crowd made a sound that people make when they see a magician mess up in a way that turns out to be the real trick, the benevolent inside-out of a show-off\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cCome away,\u201d I said, to him. \u201cCome away with me and try kindness. Just once. Just to see if it\u2019s the kind of chemical that changes you.\u201d\n\nHe looked more dangerous at that invitation than he had all morning. He looked at my hand as if it were a snake that wanted to share its venom. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou might,\u201d I said.\n\nHe looked at the milk and sneered and stepped out, pristine. The milk had not so much as spattered his hem. He is good at not being touched. He is better at leaving you without noticing. He turned to the crowd and bowed. \u201cYou have been magnificent,\u201d he said, and the sleaziest part of the day was that he meant it. \u201cTip your servers,\u201d he added, and pointed at me.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201ctip the band,\u201d and the whole line of brass laughed and took off at a tempo that broke the spell in ten strides. The strollers went back to being wheels and naps. The pond fish resumed their small politics. Layla stepped into Brill\u2019s path and handed him a book.\n\n\u201cFor you,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a very funny ending.\u201d\n\nHe took it. He is not stupid. He knows a curse when he smells one. He knows a gift that tastes the same as obligation. He tucked it under his arm and offered her a line that would have turned her eyebrows to frost; she stared him down and he let it fall. He melted away, the way he does, the way a joke does when it\u2019s told in the wrong room.\n\nI picked up the whisker key and the mirror and the bowl, and my hands were shaking just enough that I wanted to be a kitten\u2014small, unaccountable, loved for making mischief in a way that breaks nothing. But I am Tamsin. I am supposed to walk home now, and I did, with Layla on my left and Mr. Li behind me measuring the length of a treeline with his hands because he was excited and he has his ways of saying so.\n\nWe didn\u2019t win; not like that. You never do, against a creature like Brill, not fully and not forever. But there was a dent in him. A bruise where his joke had hit the mirror and bounced back. There was milk drying in the grass like an offering. There was the knowledge that laughter could be placed. It mattered where it fell. It mattered when we stepped in.\n\nAt my door, the key did the thing it does, turning the lock and also the words around it so that my name was safe inside. I set the mirror down and it reflected a ceiling that isn\u2019t mine but is, and the bowl in the sink had a ring around it at the exact height of Brill\u2019s ankles and somehow that pleased me like a recipe that came out edible when it shouldn\u2019t have. The houseplants forgave me with great dignity. I left the whisker key on the windowsill where the light could lick it, and I sat down to write a note to Auntie that said: I did it, kind of. Thank you. And also: he is not finished.\n\nThe night asked for my hands and I gave them. The night asked for my voice and I told it yes and no and maybe in a pattern that is a kind of music. I slept. I dreamed of kittens, but also of foxes, and of white bowls that held everything I am willing to hold. In the morning, the radio said it might rain later. I said good. Let it. Let the whole town wash its face. Let us start again and again, every time.",

                              "content": "The rain came like a forgiveness it hadn\u2019t entirely earned, first a spit, then a sifting, then a proper wash. It took the skins off heat and laid them over the storm drains, which breathed like sleeping animals and then like bellows when the gutters filled. The city drank. The jack pines steamed. The sidewalks re-summarized themselves as if they were rewriting an essay they\u2019d already handed in and gotten back with too many red marks. I walked without a destination because destinations feel like claims, and I was not ready to claim anything but already had too much to guard.\n\nWhen a town washes its face, names rise like soap bubbles, and some of them pop. The used bookshop sign blinked in a sequence that made a different word altogether\u2014U SED OB KS\u2014like it had lost its breath laughing. A bus rolled past with the route panel saying OOPS because the rain had got to whatever innards made its letters, and five passengers smiled at the delirium and five scowled and one took a picture because that\u2019s what we do when something lifts out of regular. The picture was already halfway around several phones by the time the bus took a corner, and if you think magic doesn\u2019t use Wi-Fi when it can, you haven\u2019t been paying attention.\n\nLayla texted a series of rain emojis and also a soup bowl, which I chose to interpret as a call for pho. I told her I\u2019d meet her later, after I had done my rounds, which is not a thing anyone told me to do but that I chose to do until it became a kind of job. I checked the park and the pond and the back of the bakery where the rats are elegant as thieves. I loosened a knot on a swing. I tightened a knot in a kid\u2019s sneaker and made sure he thought he had done it himself. I looked at the fence with the three missing slats and put my face against the damp wood. The world on the other side smelled like mint crushed underfoot and something a little bitter, the kind of bitter that makes medicine work.\n\nIf Brill had left a trap, it would be in the laughter, so I listened to laughter. There was the laugh of the man who got splashed by a taxi and pretended to be a saint about it. There was the unsuppressed cackle of the teenager who stepped in the puddle on purpose because he wanted to feel like a child. There was the shy ripple of two people who had not known whether to go on a first date and had decided, fine, if the world is this wet, let\u2019s swim. None of those were his. His laughter passed through people like a current, leaving them bright and scraped. The aftertaste wasn\u2019t here. He had gone to ground or gone online, which in our age is the same thing with a different drainage system.\n\nI stopped at the library because it is Layla\u2019s church and my favorite kind of fortress. The children\u2019s section sounded like it was radiating during a power surge, little voices pitched to a hum that interfered with the air. Layla stood behind her desk and gave me a look that was ninety percent knowing and ten percent I didn\u2019t sleep enough. There were paper cranes on the string above her that had been birds in other hands and were now metastories. She jerked her chin toward the back room.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s in the catalog, somehow,\u201d she said, when the door closed and the smell of crayons took over from old glue. \u201cI mean, not him-him. But he has a trick in there. Do you know the thing where you type three letters and it suggests a book you were embarrassed to check out last year because your ex gave it to you and you don\u2019t want to admit you liked it? It\u2019s that but worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe taught the library to remember what you thought you were over,\u201d I said, and only then realized my nails were in my palms as if I could hold onto other people\u2019s privacy for them through my skin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s adds-you-into-baskets energy,\u201d Layla said. \u201cLike you\u2019re at the grocery and the cart sees what your neighbor is buying and decides you must want it too. It\u2019s subtle. It\u2019s sticky. I\u2019m trying to not throw the server in the bathtub.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that as if you haven\u2019t already done it in your mind,\u201d I said, and she grinned briefly because she had, and because my guessing made her feel read and liked.\n\n\u201cI can scrub it, probably,\u201d she said. \u201cOr teach the system to laugh at him. That sometimes works. If a computer can pretend to be bored with a demon, the demon loses interest. They like vanity mirrors, not matte finishes.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach it to be matte,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll walk the stacks.\u201d\n\nIf you think walking stacks is nothing, you have never thought about spines whispering to each other about the hands that touched them. I followed a thread of not-funny into the 398s and then into the row where how-to manuals stand shoulder to shoulder with open secrets. A lime green tutorial on home repairs was emitting jokes about fathers that had never even tried to fix a leaky faucet, and my temper blipped so hard it sent a small flock of calm out to graze. I put my hand on the shelf and told it a story about the man I had watched at the park who fixed a stranger\u2019s rolled stroller wheel and then cried into his sleeve because that was the last thing he had done for his daughter before she told him she was moving out, and laughter rose in the shelf like yeast, gentle and true. The mean line dissolved. I knew then where Brill had slipped in: in the place where we categorize human error and teach ourselves not to be tender about it.\n\nAt the circulation desk a woman returned a book with an apologetic smile that had a rictus built into it, and we all felt Brill\u2019s finger under the corners of her mouth. \u201cOverdue,\u201d she said, and the word bristled, and Layla stepped forward like a conductor bringing in a string section and said, \u201cNo worries,\u201d which is a phrase that I mistrust when it comes too easy, but she said it in a way that meant: I see you. It worked. The word overdue became about a book and not about a moral failing, and we moved on.\n\nWhen I left the library the rain was thinking about stopping, which for rain is a complicated thought. It draped itself over the air and inspected its own drips like a seamstress checking a hem. My whisker key vibrated in my bag with the precise irritation of a small creature whose needs were not being met quickly enough. I took it out and held it, and the damp made it sound a little higher, like a violin someone had tuned for a smaller room. The key has interests. It finds doors, not just in walls but in people. It wants me to be brave and clever and also remembered, and it sulks when I am any of those without its help.\n\nThe first kitten found me at the corner of a puddle that thought it was a pond. It was not a conjuration. It was one of the city\u2019s cats, half feral, all self, with a notch in its ear and eyes the shade of glass that becomes ocean when you love it too much. It looked at me as if it thought I had something to do with the weather, which is nice to be accused of on a morning like this. It sniffed at the cuff of my jeans and then at the key and then made the sound that in my head is the word Well?, which I have been told is an error, but I am allowed some. I put a finger under its chin and it agreed to be admired. We stood there in a miniature truce until an umbrella swished by and the cat went wherever cat business takes you when you don\u2019t have pockets.\n\nThe ring behind the fence in Richmond Hill had swollen during the night. You could tell by the way the grass around it leaned in, and by the way the wrong clover looked righteous, and by the way the fence had a new eye that refused to wink. Auntie Bellflower wasn\u2019t there. The air had the taste of someone else\u2019s song. An uncle, then. They come when they think duty needs a cane.\n\nHe was sprawled on a log as if exhaustion were a mantle he had earned the right to wear, and he looked like the kind of man you would follow into a bar fight and discover you had signed up for a philosophy lecture instead. His hair had the texture of old bark. His eyes had the color of lakes right before thunder. He was not mine. He was married to a swampdream I had once touched by mistake and still had reeds in my teeth from.\n\n\u201cChild,\u201d he said, with the confidence of people who have decided the words that name you should be like coats, one-size and unisex.\n\n\u201cNephew,\u201d I said back, because rank and files have their pleasures.\n\n\u201cBellflower is mending something that needed to be mended,\u201d he said, which meant someone had asked a river to do a road\u2019s job again and she had gone to speak to the municipal planners and they had had polite tea and then she had broken a culvert with a look. \u201cSo I came to see what you were teaching the city about itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am teaching it a trick called that wasn\u2019t funny and it\u2019s okay to say so,\u201d I said.\n\nHe picked a burr out of his sleeve and rolled it between thumb and forefinger as if daring it to protest. \u201cAnd you used a mirror on a boy who eats reflections,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not here to scold you. I am here to warn you of the bill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know there\u2019s a bill,\u201d I said. \u201cI can feel it in my joints and in my hair. He will not forget being seen. He will make me feel seen in a way I do not want, and I will have to pay attention to that feeling without sending the city to bed at eight with no supper. Is there a more technical term for this?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a law,\u201d he said. \u201cStanding in a ring makes you think of laws even when you are the most lawless creature in the patch. You used the mirror for the truth and not for vanity. The bill is that you now owe the town your true story.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor how long?\u201d I asked, foolish as a child measuring the ocean with a cup.\n\n\u201cFor as long as Brill is amused,\u201d he said, which is to say for as long as it takes him to become bored with you, which is to say: longer than you think, shorter than you fear, exactly the amount of a summer that leaves you on a porch in September knowing the shape of cold.\n\n\u201cWhat kind of true story,\u201d I said, and the ring did that gasping laugh our kind does when a person has gotten cute with specificity. He shrugged.\n\n\u201cThe kind that pulls shame out like splinters and shows people how to stop apologizing to air,\u201d he said. \u201cYou already do it. Do it publicly. Bring your bowl, bring your bands, bring your friend with the letters on the fridge. The town will come because the town likes to see itself be brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like spectacles with me in them,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou have been in a spectacle since you made a home here,\u201d he said. \u201cRichmond Hill is a stadium if you stand on it wrong. Make your stadium cosy. Teach the bleachers to purr.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t conjure more kittens,\u201d I said, misreading him on purpose, because that is the only way to keep from doing what someone wants you to do immediately, which is an important muscle for a fairy who likes her own mind.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t have to,\u201d he said, and his smile made me think of rain gutters. \u201cSometimes you invite something by being it. You have made a habit of gentleness. Habits are invitations with lace on them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will charge someone for the lace,\u201d I said.\n\nHe laughed for real and expected me to leave, and I did, because lingering after you get your omen makes it look like you want to be told again and I do not. The city had wrung itself out and hung itself up. The sky was raw as a scraped knee but proud of itself. Brill had not checked in. He was folding himself somewhere into something that people would unwittingly unfold, and then he would tell them to be flattered when he wore them like a shirt.\n\nWe held the first story-night on the patch of lawn behind the band shell where the grass is always damp even when the days are cruelty. Layla printed a sign that said Tell It Like You Mean It, and below that, in smaller letters: No Jokes That Punch Down; No Jokes Sold As Therapy. Mr. Li brought a thermos the size of a child and handed everyone cups whether they wanted them or not. The brass players came because brass likes to sound like punctuation, and we needed punctuation more than we needed answers. I placed the white bowl on a hummingbird table and made it not milk. I made it water with the memory of milk, because I am not an idiot and I know an invitation when I have already written it. The mirror lay face down and showed me a fox if I wanted to think about it.\n\nThe first person up was the girl in the red shirt from the patio, whose chair scrape I had not forgotten. She had a hand on her stomach as if she was hiding a wound and a grin that did not know it was a weapon yet. She told a story about being the loud friend and about how sometimes you want to be the quiet friend and be asked to speak, and the chorus raised itself at the right place, which was when she said: I learned to leave my laugh at home and I came back and it had starved. The second was the man with the briefcase, who had nothing to declare but a father who didn\u2019t say anything nice until he turned seventy and then said everything too often, and somehow it was lovely when he admitted that when the compliments came he despaired because he had been practicing without them for too long. We all laughed where we should, which meant we didn\u2019t laugh where we shouldn\u2019t, which is a discipline that comes like music if you listen.\n\nBrill did not come in a coat of himself. He came as a whisper in the trees that carried the one-liners you tell when you are tired of earnestness, and then he went away because the oaks did not like it. He put two boys in the back into that mood where you want to say something clever and cruel so that the circle will notice you, and the boys swallowed the impulse and spoke about their mothers instead, which is the kind of miracle no church says is a miracle because it would wreck the hymns. He started a rumor in the corner that the bowl would turn anyone who looked into it into a cat for a week, and we let that rumor circulate because it gave the children practice in not believing what made their fur stand up.\n\nIt happened when the third reader, an auntie of no ring at all but of all the aunties the world makes for itself, stood up and said, \u201cMy brother died laughing and I am angry about it,\u201d which is a sentence that tries to be a paragraph and fails only because it doesn\u2019t have enough breaths in it. The kittens came then. Not from my pockets and not from the bushes but from the fact that a thing needed them. They came as if they had been stationed in gutters and under porches and on the ledges of basement windows, waiting for a note. Twenty, then fifty, then enough to make you feel like your ankles had become interesting property. They weren\u2019t a flood. Floods panic. This was a tide. They came and sat and blinked and not one of them made a sound beyond a purr so deep it tickled the worm-castings.\n\nNo one screamed because the story had taught them something already. A child laughed and then clapped both hands over their mouth because they\u2019d been told no we are listening and had learned that being shushed is a kind of attention if you do it with love. The auntie told us about the funeral and about the awful thing the cousin said that made everyone pretend to enjoy it and about the way that laughter felt like it was lifting her like a crane and then put her down somewhere she didn\u2019t recognize. She told us about how she had still cooked and folded and clocked in and out and how sometimes you want an audience automatically the way a wound wants air, and how that is not the same as healing. The kittens leaned against her ankles as if she had not noticed she was a building that needed reinforcement. The purr was an architecture.\n\nLayla caught my eye at the moment when the first cat looked at me and refused to be a metaphor. \u201cYou did this,\u201d she mouthed. I wanted to lie and say no it was the weather because weather is always a good scapegoat. I wanted to tell the truth the way Uncle told me to and say yes, this is what follows me when I am good. I shrugged, which is another way of saying I am attempting to tolerate responsibility without choking on it.\n\nBrill tested us. It is either a vice or a loyalty with him. He sent through the crowd a line about women and grief that would have laid ten aunties open like fish for market if it had gone where it meant to, and the line hit the purr and slid off. He tried with the children: a joke about librarians that would have made the kids look at Layla as if she kept secrets not for them but against them, and the joke caught in the fur that was now like grass and fell to pieces as if a child had taken it apart to see what it was made of and found only air and spit. He left because there is only so long you can talk to a room that has learned to prefer listening.\n\nAfter, when people were winding down and wiping eyes with the hems of clean sleeves and returning the cups to Mr. Li who somehow had more in the thermos than he had started with, I moved through the cats as if I were one of them. The key sang. I put it in the bowl because I needed to know if the world would let me. It nested like a fish in a still pond. A kitten stretched and yawned and put a paw in the water and hissed because cats must try everything and must complain when everything is what it is. The uncle\u2019s advice had been a clutch of thorns and I had grabbed it anyway, and my palms were full of stings and I felt whole.\n\nIt could have ended there, in the soft, and because it could, it didn\u2019t. A voice cut across the grass, not Brill\u2019s but the one he uses when he wants to sound like an authority and not like a friend. \u201cPermit?\u201d it said, which is not a fairy word unless we are laughing. Three municipal workers in rain jackets held clipboards as if they had brooms hidden in them, and they had come on an errand that had the smell of his mouth on it. \u201cThis is a public green,\u201d the tallest said in the tone of a person who has had to memorize a new script and is not sure whether the audience has learned the call-and-response. \u201cYou are\u2026 gathering.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d Layla said, and stepped forward because that is her shape in a crisis\u2014it\u2019s a step, it\u2019s a forward, and none of us has gotten tired of it yet.\n\n\u201cYou need a permit for any public performance,\u201d he said, and the word performance tasted the way old plastic tastes if you chew on it by mistake.\n\n\u201cWhat if it\u2019s a public grief,\u201d the auntie asked him, so mild you would have missed the point if you had not taken a job where points are your staple.\n\nHe looked down at his form. The water from his cuffs dripped exactly where you would expect it to, which told me that magic had not reached those hems yet. \u201cWe have had a complaint about cats,\u201d he said, as if anyone in the history of this region had not.\n\n\u201cKittens,\u201d Mr. Li said, in a tone that did not commit to either mischief or obedience.\n\nI sensed in the close air the shape of Brill\u2019s grin, somewhere behind that man\u2019s left shoulder. Not a possession. A sponsorship. He had found another seam: the one where the rules keep us decent and also keep us small. He had filed a complaint, because even kings used to send a bailiff before they sent a blade, and he is nothing if not a king without furniture. He wanted me to argue on the grounds he had offered, then twist, then have to audience my way out while he held a stopwatch.\n\nI did not argue. I put my hands together as if I were praying to the idea of the city, and I said, to the clipboards and whatever was listening through them, \u201cWe are a story hour. We have a librarian, we have a book, we have a bowl of water and some cats who are sitting as if they were being read to. We are within noise bylaws. We have no amplification beyond brass, which in this municipality is sacred. If you would like to issue us a fine, we will pay it in pennies and parties.\u201d\n\nHe blinked because that is not how you speak to authority and also because it is exactly how you speak to authority when it is also an auntie in a nice vest. He passed his eyes\u2014poor, tired eyes\u2014over the faces and the fur. His shoulder softened half a millimeter, which is the kind of change that can stop a war. \u201cJust\u2026 keep the cats from the playground,\u201d he said, and because the world can be merciful if you feed it the right sentence in the right place, a tabby got up and stretched and led a small pilgrimage of kittens to the other side of the grass. The worker exhaled. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said to Layla, because she was closest and because she is what you say thank you to when you don\u2019t know the shape of what helped.\n\nWhen the crowd thinned and it was only us, which is to say the ones who would come back when it got cold and the ones who would bring a neighbor because it felt like cheating to keep this to yourself, I sat on the low wall and put my face in my hands and held my head gently to remind it it belonged to my neck. Layla put an elbow into my side because she knows better than to put a hand on a fairy in public unless you mean to adopt. \u201cYou did it,\u201d she said, and then laughed, a little angry because that is her luxury when she knows we are safe for ten minutes. \u201cYou made a cat choir. Of course you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d I said, and then corrected myself because the uncle and the mirror and my own skin demanded it. \u201cI invited. They came.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe woke something up,\u201d Mr. Li said, as if Brill were the weather and we were the leaves. \u201cAnd you told it we were a sanctuary, not a stadium.\u201d\n\nAt home the houseplants had organized a coup and decided to look wilty to get my attention. I misted everyone like a benevolent tyrant. The bowl went into the sink and made the note it makes when you put something holy into a place where we do our dullest work. The whisker key lay on the white of the bathtub and warmed the tile like a little sun, sulking because it had not been the star. I told it aloud that everyone gets their turn, which made me sound like a manager I swore I would never be.\n\nThe knock at my door came at an hour that does not exist on clocks but exists in bones; it was the hour when the city resets its shock absorbers and wonders whether to creak or sigh. I opened it because I am foolish or brave or because I had already seen who stood on the other side in three different reflections. Brill leaned in the hallway and admired my landlord\u2019s poorly painted baseboards as if he had designed them. He was damp as a dog and brighter than he had a right to be after being thwarted in front of trumpets.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re popular,\u201d he said, not looking at me, as if my popularity were an object he had set down someplace and forgotten.\n\n\u201cSo are you,\u201d I said. \u201cWith the Parks Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend bureaucracy isn\u2019t a band I can play,\u201d he said. \u201cYou caught that tune, too, I see.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all trying to be decent,\u201d I said, which is a sentence that can make you sound smug if you aim it wrong, and which I have practiced saying with my throat shaped like an apology.\n\nHe put his shoulder against my doorframe and hummed the first bar of the song that used to call me when I was wild. \u201cI thought you would break the mirror,\u201d he said. \u201cJust to see what happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you would drink the milk,\u201d I said. \u201cJust to see what happened.\u201d\n\nWe grinned at each other like enemies who had inherited the same aunt\u2019s ugly couch and had both secretly decided to love it out of spite. \u201cYou\u2019re going to ask me for kindness again,\u201d he said, with the weariness of someone who knows the flavor of their least favorite medicine.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d I said. \u201cNot because I think you\u2019ll say yes, but because I think the asking is the kind of spell that keeps the doors open.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoors,\u201d he said, and looked past me at the key on the tub. \u201cYou and your keys.\u201d He lifted his chin. \u201cCareful with your kittens, Tammy-Tam. People are going to put their mouths on them and call it cute when what they\u2019re doing is learning that softness is a vending machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a price,\u201d I said. \u201cI always did. I\u2019ve made it clear. I take the moment you would have regretted and give you back an hour you can live in. They can send the bill to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd one day,\u201d he said, and the hallway light flickered because even electricity likes drama, \u201cone day, I will turn you into what you make. I\u2019ll do it cleanly. I\u2019ll do it with consent. I\u2019ll make you a kitten and I\u2019ll hold you in my hands and you\u2019ll see that softness is a blade too when you\u2019re not swinging it. Then we will call it even.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d I said, and it sounded like a prayer because I had Auntie Bellflower in my chest where she had told me to put her, and because the uncle\u2019s burr had gotten under my nail and made thinking easy.\n\nHe pushed off from the frame and walked down the hallway and did not look back because he knows better than to give me that victories in such small currencies. \u201cSoon,\u201d he said, a promise or a lie, and if there\u2019s a difference with him I have never found it.\n\nI closed the door and sat on the floor because sometimes you have to be low to feel high. The city breathed. The cats outside handled their wars and their courts and their romance under parked cars like the princes they are. I cleaned the bowl until it lost the last trace of sweet. I put my hand flat on the mirror until my face blurred into a truth that looked just like me. I thought about the story I owed and what it would cost to tell it right, which is always the price you pay when you come from people who think secrets are seasoning and you decide to be a meal somebody can eat without guessing spices.\n\nIn the morning the radio said that the headline was Kittens Disrupt Community Event, and Layla sent me a picture of the paper and a caption that read: they spelled disrupt wrong, and I sent back a picture of the bowl and a caption that read: they spelled kitten wrong. Auntie Bellflower sent no note because she knows the value of letting you not be praised. The uncle had left a burr on my windowsill, which is a joke where he comes from and a blessing where I live. I put it in my pocket next to the copper wire and thought about the parade of our ordinary days, and about how a joke can be a kindness if you remember to put a chair under the part of you that is going to sit down when the laugh shakes you. Then I went out to buy milk. It wasn\u2019t for me. I told myself that. But I felt the part of me that wanted to lap at the brim and be forgiven for once without doing any work and I told that part, steady now, we only ever get the miracles we are willing to clean up after.",

The refrigeration units breathed clean, and the fans above the rotisserie chickens sounded like the tired wings of angels who had taken a side gig. I walked past pyramid stacks of nectarines that promised to bruise if you looked at them wrong and let my hand hover over cartons of cream that wanted to be in coffee and argued about it. The milk took up a full wall and still a woman beside me sighed like there was not enough of it in the world. I picked the one that pours best, which is a knowledge you only get if you pour for others often. The label had a cow on it that looked so content it was almost indecent, and someone had written on the shelf tag in pencil: local-ish. A worker with the posture of a retired dancer had left a mop leaning against an endcap that bragged about loyalty points. I looked at the loyalty points and saw Brill in them. He had taught the store to remember your third choice and offer it first, as if it were a summer fling circling back to propose.\n\n\u201cWant a sample?\u201d a man in a vest said to me, his hat hatched with rain salt and his eyes bright with the manic conviction of someone who has been told to be jovial or perish. He held out a thimble cup of yogurt in a flavor named after a dessert that should not be a yogurt. Behind him stood a boy with a face like a door left ajar, hopeful and wary.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d I said, gently enough that we were both let off the hook. The boy reached for my milk without thinking and then did think and took his hand back like it had found a hot pan. I smiled at him the way you smile at the part of a child that has not yet decided to remain a child.\n\nAt the registers a woman with a bruise on her arm shaped like a number loaded up a conveyor belt with seventeen cans of beans and two boxes of cereal with cartoon bees that look like they know your bank balance. The cashier looked like he had been born at his station and not minded. The monitor flickered and began to suggest recipes: beans with bravado, beans with apology, beans with the sentence you are not daring enough today and the next day you will be too careful. It was Brill\u2019s work, small and corrosive, disguised as convenience. The woman made a face like she\u2019d been offered a compliment by someone she didn\u2019t want to owe.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to turn it off?\u201d the cashier asked, and you could hear he was repeating a line, not offering a kindness. I pulled the mirror out of my bag under the pretense of checking the way the rain had arranged my hair, and tilted it so the screen saw itself for half a second. The recipes broke into numbers and then into letters and then into a sort of satisfied hum the way a cat will climb into a box, decide it is adequate, and sleep.\n\nShe caught my eye and nodded once. \u201cThanks,\u201d she said to no one, so the debt had a place to sit that was not my name.\n\nOn the way out I passed a pyramid of mangoes that had started to smell like a memory of a country I have never been to, and a brand ambassador offered me a card that would build a tally of my habits and present me with a joke about them every Friday. I declined. He did not insist; probably he had been to one of our nights and recognized my face, or else he recognized my refusal as a type he feared to catalog.\n\nOutside the rain had made a lace out of traffic and pinned it to the day. Cars hissed secrets at each other. The bus exhaled in the way of large animals pretending to be infrastructure. A woman in a green coat tilted her head to watch a squirrel execute a precision jump from one tree to another and then whisper, with feeling, \u201cShowoff,\u201d and the squirrel executed a second jump that you could only call an encore. I walked north with milk hip-braced against my side and wondered if I was ready to show anything to anyone tonight.\n\nThe bill for the mirror lay in my mouth, a coin I couldn\u2019t swallow. Layla would be at the library making a sign that was both solemn and silly, because if you don\u2019t do both you are making religion or you are making a party and neither will do. Mr. Li would arrive with his thermos and his patient hands. The auntie with the jaguar-grief would come because she had discovered that her laugh could be used for something besides carrying other people\u2019s weight. The municipal worker would come without his clipboard and with a fold-up chair, because I had seen a future in which he discovered the joy of being anonymous in a crowd of people who had decided to be known.\n\nI wanted to open the ring and ask Bellflower what kind of truth counts as tender and what kind counts as reckless. I wanted to be told that I could pay my debt with interest and then not think about it again. The fence considered me as I passed, all spruce eye and resin eyelid, and did not wink. The clover hissed a warning in a tiny voice. The backyard smelled like pies and mischief remembered. The ring can be stingy when you are about to publicly remove your own fur.\n\nAt home I set the milk on the counter with the carefulness I reserve for gifts and curses. The houseplants had rallied and did not require my drama. The whisker key thrummed on the tile as if it were counting down to a trick it desperately wanted to perform. The mirror lay face-up, catching the light that had more gray in it than it should have, showing me both the crinkles at my eyes and the part of me that still looks like the girl who walked into the ring without asking and forgot what to call herself until someone with a spider\u2019s patience spun the syllables back into a sound.\n\nThe truth I owed was a knot with my teeth in it. The first strand was winter. It was the winter I have already mentioned, the one where a boy was turning himself into a story because he had been told with such conviction that he was a story that he believed it more than the heat in his fingers. He had walked out onto Bond Lake in boots named after mountains, liked the music of the ice when it sang its submarine songs, and asked the cold to make him into something worth repeating. His mother had found his bike leaning against a fence like a faithful dog. I found his hat caught on a reed where the water was too thin for anything but foolhardy birds.\n\nI have a way with small things. I do not have a way with boys making larger choices. I stood on the shore and tasted the air and did the calculus you do when you are about to move without moving. I took the thread from my own dress and tied it around my wrist, which is how you anchor yourself to a truth you will want to escape later. I walked out, not onto the ice\u2014never onto the ice; we are not that arrogant\u2014but into the part of the lake that knows what to do with names. I said his name and heard that it had been left for a while in the care of a willow and had gotten sticky with sap. I called him back with the tone you use for cats and stubborn gods. He looked at me as if my face was something that only made sense once you warmed up. He said he didn\u2019t want to come. I said that was what stories say, and he was not a story yet. He asked what he would be instead. I said, to my shame, you will be alive, which is not an answer and too often a sentence. I did a wrong thing and then a right thing. The wrong thing was to take his hand without asking. The right thing was to give him a joke one of the aunties had taught me that belongs to winter: What do you call it when the wind holds your breath for you? Kindness. He came. The ice muttered but did not crack. The willow shook its shoulders and the sap let him go.\n\nAfter that, things in the city started to notice me in the way of animals with favors to return and grudges to nurse. The aunties met me in the ring and told me my habit had been set. They said: you will be the one with the kittens, you will be the one who answers the worst versions of what-ifs with soft yeses. They laughed at me kindly and gave me the whisker key and told me that one day I would have to buy myself back from the bargain I had struck with myself. I asked them for the return policy. They said: you have to tell the truth out loud where the judging is easy and the mercy is hard. I said: so, the internet? Bellflower hit me with a blade of grass and told me I was getting too clever.\n\nThe second strand was a girl named Keira who did not want help and did not need it until she did. She stood at a bus stop and let the rain collect on her eyelashes and pretended not to hear when the man beside her took a tone with her shoulders. He used the voice that says I am joking and you are not very fun. He used the body that says I am reaching for you and you should be flattered. The bus came and did not stop because it had been bewitched by a scheduling error. I did the thing I do. I kittened him. It made it a scene when what she had wanted was to be invisible. He went small and soft and confused and his friends hooted and pretended to be surprised that he had a whine on him. She looked at me with fury and gratitude and said, my problem is that I am always being taken into other people\u2019s jokes without being asked whether I am funny. Later she brought me a doughnut with cinnamon and sugar like home and told me her name and the names of the women who would call me if they needed me. That is a debt you pay with a ledger you aren\u2019t allowed to keep.\n\nThere is also a third strand that I do not tell, but I will have to tell, because the uncle said so and because Brill already knows the shape of it. It is Brill and me in a backyard with laundry that smells like lemon and an afternoon that thought it could go on forever. It is him asking me what I have that isn\u2019t kindness and me showing him the edge on it. It is him taking that edge and teaching himself how to cut without making a mess. It is the first time I heard his joke land inside a person I love, and the first time I failed to block it because I had been proud and late. It is a thing that I will say tonight if the milk looks back at me and tells me to.\n\nBy dusk the park had wrung itself out and combed its hair. The red ants had made a detour around the cap of a bottle someone had left, and the crows had called a meeting and then postponed it due to air. The children\u2019s section of the library had been disassembled and reassembled into a ghazal of blankets and chairs. Layla\u2019s sign read: Pay Attention, With Snacks. The brass players did their mouthpiece stretches and looked like men blowing kisses into their own hands, which is not a bad habit if you need to mine affection from the air. Kittens arrived without fanfare and arranged themselves like punctuation at the ends of rows. The municipal worker came in a shirt that said STAFF because the city is wry, and sat far left where he could make an exit without anyone blessing him or blaming him. Mr. Li placed his thermos as if it were an altar and poured cups for people who had never expected to be served anything for free in a public space.\n\nI looked for Brill and did not find him in any human shape. He was the feeling in the air when someone is about to remember what you owe them. He was the way the mosquitoes organized themselves into a choir and then forgot the melody. He was the point at the end of a sentence when you decide whether to be polite or to be true. I set the bowl at my feet and it made its resigned, useful sound. I set the mirror under the chair because this was not about me looking at myself when I could be looking at others. The whisker key pressed a vibration against my thigh in my pocket that said I could experiment if I wanted to, which is not a thing keys should say to their owners.\n\nLayla warmed the room with her voice. She told us about the first book she read that made her understand that she could read, a cheap children\u2019s thing with a turtle on a raft that had gotten caught in a reprint and come out with the first two pages dirtily doubled. She said, you think you have to start with the right words and sometimes you just start with the wrong words twice and then you catch up. People laughed in the way that feeds the body and does not nibble at the soul. She handed the floor to me because she knows about bills and has a sense of theater that she uses only for good.\n\n\u201cI owe you a story,\u201d I said, and felt in the soles of my feet the hush that means you are telling the truth even before you learned what it is. \u201cI owe you a story because I held a mirror up to a boy who eats reflections, and that\u2019s a trick that comes with a price. The price is this. I tell you who I was when I was too soft, and who I was when I was not soft enough, and who I am when I am exactly the right amount of soft for someone else and impossible for myself. I will not mention names because I am a keeper of them. I will make jokes, but they will not be used as knives. If you feel a laugh come up that is shaped like superiority, you are allowed to hold it in your mouth and taste it and then let it go without putting it in the air. If you feel a cry that would embarrass you if it were photographed, you may keep it in your pocket and take it out on your walk home. If you feel nothing, you are not broken. Not feeling is a feeling. I love you anyway, which is rude to say, but I do. I was taught to.\u201d\n\nThe law of our kind is mossy and written in fog, but it woke and rubbed its eyes and noticed me. I talked about the winter and the boy and the willow. I described the sound the ice makes when it wants to be helpful and knows that being helpful is how people die. The brass put a tender comma in the air when I needed one. The kittens in the front row stretched and prompted me to slow down. I told them about Keira at the bus stop and the way you can make a scene without making a mess, and the way the worst thing you can do is make someone a metaphor when they need to be a person. I told them about the first time an auntie made me feel messy and useful and how I loved her for that because the people who had held me before had wanted me to be a song, and I am not a song, I am a shelf, I am a key ring, I am a bowl.\n\nWhen I got to the third strand I took a breath that went down the wrong pipe and had to cough. A kitten ran head-first into my ankle in sympathy and then sat on my foot. I could have told them the easier story here. I could have told them about a hospital waiting room in January and the way the fluorescent lights make everyone look like they regret a decision they haven\u2019t made yet. I could have told them about the time I had to pretend to be a nurse because the nurse had to pretend to be a person and we were both bad at it. I owed the harder thing.\n\n\u201cHe told me a joke,\u201d I said, and let Brill emerge from the pronoun because if he wanted to be named he could have come. \u201cHe told me a joke dressed as a love letter, and I laughed, because he is very good, and because I am very good at being loved in ways that do not ask me to do any work. The joke was this: that if I never let anyone suffer near me, I will be necessary forever and never, therefore, alone. The punchline was this: that he would always bring me a little pain to fix so that I would never notice that he kept a big one for the times when I was looking the other way. I took that bargain for a year, which is a long time in fairy and a short time in human and exactly enough time for a city to learn your habit and feed you occasions. I hurt someone I love by being generous in a way that kept them small. I turned them soft when they wanted to be sharp, because I didn\u2019t want to hear the sound of their edge and I didn\u2019t want to feel the weight of their anger. I apologize to the air when I say this, because the person does not owe me their privacy back, but I apologize to you as well, because I have made a spectacle of softness and sometimes that spectacle denies people the dignity of their steel.\u201d\n\nThe park didn\u2019t move. The municipal worker shifted and then pretended he hadn\u2019t. Layla\u2019s face did the thing it does when she hears a note sung true even if the singer would have preferred to be a better musician. The brass put down their horns, blessedly. The kittens didn\u2019t fluff. You know how cats get big when you make a noise like a hawk? They didn\u2019t. They went smaller and nearer. A child put her hand on one and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d the way children who have had to say it to themselves do.\n\n\u201cI am learning to ask,\u201d I said, and this is a sentence that should have been a paragraph and the paragraph should have bought me several redeeming paragraphs more. \u201cI am learning to ask if you want the spell I have. I am learning to hear no when I want to hear please. I am learning to start with please. I am learning to listen to the joke before I try to break it. I am learning that when you hold a mirror up and someone hates it, the thing to do is not shatter the mirror but offer it flat and walk away.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t triumph. It never is. The stories paid some of the bill and left a tip and still there was a penny under the chair that I would have to come back for. Brill showed up then. He had to. He is a creature of timing and cannot bear to miss his cue. He didn\u2019t take a form. He moved through the crowd as a consensus. He said, in the voice of women who have been told their laugh is too much, \u201cYou think you are the first to discover honesty,\u201d and a dozen of us snorted. He said, in the voice of men who have never been told they were pretty, \u201cYou think your tricks make you brave,\u201d and a handful of kids said out loud, \u201cNo,\u201d which made me want to throw my keys at the moon and ask for a new set for this place where children could answer back correctly.\n\nHe told us a joke about towns that rescue themselves and become smug about it. He told us a joke about cats that think they are charms. He told us a joke about librarians who fall in love with their own gospels. He put hooks under the words and then the hooks hit the purring and slid off, not because the purr was a shield, but because the room had learned a countermelody. He got bored. He looked for a glass to drop. There were none. He looked for a man whose mother had given him a name he hated. That man had left his name at home on purpose and brought a nickname he wore like a hoodie that smelled like bonfire.\n\nBrill found me because he is compelled to. He spoke to the part of me that wants to be adored for usefulness and said, \u201cI am going to give you your wish,\u201d which is exactly wrong because I never wish out loud. He made the air smell like the inside of a bakery at three a.m. He made the bowl of milk I had not poured yet ache. He asked for my consent in the most honest voice I have ever heard him use. He said, \u201cLet me turn you into what you make. Let me hold you. Let me show you that you cannot do this forever.\u201d\n\nThere is a piece of Law that says if you are asked properly and you say yes, the aunties cannot step in and the uncles will turn their heads and the rings will pretend to be moss. Layla looked at me with a face that had all four punctuation magnets on it at once. Mr. Li placed a hand flat on the bench as if ready to test whether wood could carry a weight it hadn\u2019t been built for. The kittens put one paw each on my shoe and waited in case I fell and needed to be braced by smallness.\n\n\u201cNot even for a minute?\u201d Brill asked, and that is how the worst contracts are written: in minutes, in moments, in just until you\u2019ve had your fill. I wanted it. Of course I did. I wanted to be small and carried and adored by fingers that try to resist but cannot. I wanted to know what I have been handing out all this time without ever taking a portion. I wanted to see whether I am all fur and bones or if there is something else underneath that will reach for you with claws out if you stop petting. I wanted him to know that he could be gentle, because I suspect it would ruin him.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said, because it is a sentence with the weight of a cathedral if you lean your shoulder into it properly. \u201cNot today. You are fun, but you are careless. I will not let carelessness do surgery on me.\u201d\n\nHe laughed, genuinely, because saying no to him turns him on in the way that makes his eyes lose their color and get too human. He said, \u201cLater,\u201d and this time it wasn\u2019t a threat or a promise; it was a fighting lesson. He left and took two mosquitoes with him, whose families will miss them and then be relieved.\n\nWe sat there in the after of it. People told their stories with the lights the city gives you for free\u2014streetlamps and moon and the glow from a distant baseball diamond where men with generous bellies and complicated marriages try to feel exactly as important as they were when they were seventeen. We clapped and did not whistle because a whistle makes a spell you don\u2019t want in a circle like this. The kittens dispersed with the air of creatures who have got tips in cash and in sardines. I washed the bowl at the standpipe behind the band shell and the water said thank you via a slant against my wrist. Layla stacked chairs with a competence that makes strong men propose and she declined none of them and all of them simultaneously by smiling with what she has instead of what she owes.\n\nOn the walk home the rabbits acted like they owned the sidewalk and I let them. A couple under a porch light kissed like they had not yet learned that the first kiss can be startling and then a map, and I did not look away, which is not rude, it is witness. The night had lost that strobe of impending. It wore a sweater. It was boring. I nearly wept with gratitude for the boredom of a Canadian suburb when the bad jokes are pointed at someone who can take them and take them apart.\n\nMy landlord had left a notice about water shutoffs for repairs that would not happen on the day indicated, and his cat had knocked it sideways so that it read WAR SHUF. She looked at me as if I had done it and I took the blame because you should always take the blame from someone who has whiskers and no thumbs. In the bathroom the whisker key rolled into my palm as if it had changed its mind about sulking. It vibrated in frequencies only my teeth understood. I sat on the edge of the tub and held it and said thank you without asking for a thing, and for once it hummed back without demanding a door.\n\nI dreamt of a kitchen where every drawer had a secret I had put there and forgotten. I dreamt of a bus where every seat had a kitten and a man stood in the aisle and wept because he had found something that quieted the noise in him without asking him to punch holes in anyone else\u2019s air. I dreamt of Brill as a boy who had not yet learned to operate his own elegance and who dropped it like a plate and cleaned it up clumsily and no one laughed. I woke to a morning that was an ordinary Monday. The radio talked about road closures and the price of avocados and the mayor\u2019s latest attempt to make the city a verb. Layla texted: inventory day send help, and then: actually send croissants, and I sent both, because love is a choice and logistics.\n\nThe uncle had left a burr on my windowsill again. This one had a spider web in it that glittered in a way that I recognized as a hint. If you want to catch bigger problems, you make a bigger web, but you make the strands further apart so that the small things still go through. I put the burr by the whisker key and the mirror and the bowl and stood back and felt like a witch, which is not an insult where I come from. The Law tucked itself back into the cracks. The bill had a dent in it. I owed more, but not in a way that would eat me whole.\n\nBy lunchtime the headlines had multiplied like mushrooms: Community Cats Charm Crowd; Unauthorized Therapy Event Reported; Jokes Are Serious Business, Says Librarian; Local Fairy Declines To Be Cute, City Divided. I took the parcels to the library and let myself in the back and put the croissants on the shelf where Layla hides her victories. The children built a fort out of encyclopedias that are now written in pixels, and a boy with too many teeth said to me, solemnly, \u201cWe don\u2019t need cats today because we have capes,\u201d and I saluted him as if he\u2019d outranked me. Brill sent me a picture on a number I had not given him of my whisker key with a caption: you\u2019ll never open me, and I replied with a picture of a bowl of milk with none of my reflections in it and a caption: I don\u2019t have to.\n\nOn the street outside the Finch a guy in a blazer practiced his apology to a door. It is a useful skill, apologizing to things. The used bookshop sign had finally given up on the B and proposed U SED OOKS, which is closer to a truth than you\u2019d think. The storm drains breathed and forgot themselves and remembered. The summer leaned on its elbows and considered starting again. I had to go see Auntie Bellflower because she would not congratulate me and I needed the practice in being unpraised. I had to see Brill somewhere other than a room full of other people and stand near him without letting my pulse dictate the hour.\n\nI took the milk with me because I am stubborn and because he had asked and because I had said no and because sometimes no has to be fed, too. In the ring the clover looked smug and the fence finally winked like I had gotten over myself. Auntie Bellflower sat on her mushroom with her tiny bone harp and a face like a poem that doesn\u2019t resolve. \u201cWell,\u201d she said at once, to save us both from my report, and then, \u201cShow me your hands.\u201d\n\nI showed her the palms I had held the night in and the fingers I had pointed at jokes, the nail with the burr sting under it and the callus that comes from carrying groceries instead of grief. She took them and turned them over and put one against her cheek like she was listening. \u201cYou paid some of it,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll never pay all of it. That\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the point,\u201d I said, which is a question we ask each other at least once a month and then refuse to answer the same way twice.\n\n\u201cThe point is that he tried to put the town in a room he had rented in his head, and you opened the windows,\u201d she said, and then she flicked my ear for being pleased. \u201cHe is going to try again. He is going to bring cameras. He is going to ask you for small yeses until you are exhausted, and then he will ask you for a big one when you want to be adored. Do not make a habit of no. It will make you brittle. Make a habit of choosing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate how you\u2019re always right,\u201d I said, which is worship in our family.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cHate is a rope you can pull yourself up with. Love is a net. Use both. Bring milk. Bring mirrors. Bring Layla. Bring your landlord\u2019s cat if she lets you. Teach the city the difference between a performance and a practice.\u201d\n\nOn my way back out the mulberry tree dropped three ripe fruits on my shoulder on purpose and I put one in my mouth and it inked my tongue and tasted like sugar the first time you can afford your own grocery bill. The ring closed. The afternoon opened. Brill was somewhere doing something with someone else\u2019s pity. The city was mine in the way it is anyone\u2019s who decides to set their tools down and call a place a place they will defend. I went to the pond. Mr. Li waved. Children in sandbox grit made castles that would be destroyed by weather and felt, for once, both urgent and unimportant about that. The brass practiced the bridge of a song with a name that smelled like rain on concrete. I put the bowl on the bench and let the cats drink, which is an invitation and a refusal and a covenant and also a chore if you do it right, and believe me, I intend to do it right.",

The headlines laminated themselves to coffee shop tables as if anyone had ever been convinced by ink to change their mind. The kittens went back to being municipal punctuation marks. Layla texted me a picture of a flyer slapped crooked over the community corkboard between a call for babysitters and a guitar teacher: LAUGH-IN RICHMOND HILL! LIVE TAPING! SPECIAL GUESTS! CONSENT FORMS PROVIDED! The font had that particular optimism that smells like LED stage lights. It had Brill\u2019s curve to it, the way the exclamation points leaned like they\u2019d learned to do at his knee.\n\nI had told Auntie Bellflower I would not make a habit of no, and I meant it, but I am capable of a beautiful and elaborate maybe. I walked to the library because that is where we plan our maybes; Layla had a spread of clipboards and pens and a stack of signs that couldn\u2019t decide whether they wanted to be polite or effective. The children\u2019s section hummed in the register where truth hides, low enough to calm but high enough to irritate anyone who came in looking for silence. We took the flyer and read it together like it might be willing to confess.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring cameras,\u201d she said, which was unoriginal and accurate.\n\n\u201cThe cameras are not the problem,\u201d I said. \u201cThe problem is the audience he thinks he is bringing with them. The problem is the laugh track he wants to splice in between us and our breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we seed our own audience,\u201d she said, and set her mouth like a door you have to push because it sticks in humidity. \u201cWe make people who know where to place their laughter, who know how not to feed him, who know what to do when a consent form has teeth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do we teach first,\u201d I asked, because we both know that the course you think you\u2019re teaching is never the one people actually learn.\n\nShe took the flyer and flipped it over to the blank side\u2014blank except for the faint smell of toner and the ghost of the exclamation points bleeding through like a premonition\u2014and wrote: Rules For Watching Each Other. She did not number them, because numbering makes people argue with you in sequence. She wrote: listen before you laugh; and: if you can\u2019t tell who the joke is for, it isn\u2019t for you; and: if a form makes your stomach feel like a fist, don\u2019t sign it alone. I added: you can always walk away even if the camera is on you; and: the world won\u2019t end if you don\u2019t give anyone a reaction.\n\nWe made copies and stocked the library with them as if they were immunizations and sent children home with one each tucked into their summer reading lists under a sticker with a turtle on a raft. The municipal worker whose shirt had said STAFF\u2014Hardeep, as it turned out, with the soft H of a family that knows more than one language and speaks all of them with respect\u2014came by on his lunch and took a handful of the sheets as if he were doing inventory for a shortage. He leaned on the desk like a man who had just discovered that bureaucracy comes with a conscience if you put your ear to it and rest there awhile.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be asked to issue a permit,\u201d he said, giving me the expression of someone who doesn\u2019t know whether he\u2019s the messenger or the fuse. \u201cIf you can make it boring, that helps. If you can make it boring and fun, you\u2019ll save me some paperwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the queen of boring and fun,\u201d I said, and Layla snorted and then turned it into a cough because she has not yet made a habit of letting me be right in public.\n\nThe taping was slated for Hillcrest because nothing says civic like a mall pretending to be a piazza under skylights that pinch the sky into diamonds. In the hours between the flyer and the event, Brill did what he does best: he set table after table with little amuse-bouches of cruelty, small freebies that make you arrive hungry. The mall\u2019s screens began to run a feed called YOU KNOW THAT FRIEND? and asked people to describe their friends in ways that would have gotten them exiled from rings in better eras. The loyalty points program sent a push notification to phones that said if you laughed out loud on camera today you could earn double points for purchases in categories called Confession and Indulgence. A kiosk near the food court hung a sign that read CONSENT STATION, where a very sweet woman with clipboard and smile offered releases that put your name into a wallet Brill could take home and spend without asking. We got there early, which is another way of saying we were already behind.\n\nI wore the shoes I can stand in for hours without debating my own shins and a shirt that read LOCAL NOISE across the front because I had hopes for my subtlety and I have been wrong before. The whisker key hummed in my pocket like it wanted to introduce me to someone. The mirror lay wrapped in a scarf in my bag; I did not take it out because places like this have mirrors everywhere and none that work the way you need them to. Layla took her position at the library\u2019s pop-up table we had elbowed between a phone case cart and a cupcake display; she made the Rules look like something you get for free and secretly would have paid for. Hardeep hovered near the potted tree that thinks it is outdoors and watched his fellow city employees unfold stanchions with the tenderness most people reserve for new babies.\n\nBrill arrived later than he could have and earlier than he should, which is his favorite technique. He had traded his denim for a jacket that fit him as if he had grown inside it in a warm climate. He was not alone, because he is never alone in places like this; he was surrounded by a moving, breathing rig that looked like a spider one of our uncles might have dated in a bad period: arms out for microphones, eyes of glass and bright insect hunger, legs that bent where they don\u2019t on humans. The production company had a name that would have embarrassed a deity but endeared a startup: LaughLines. A boy whose face was trying out the shape of beard carried the kind of camera that makes people think their lives were happening all along, they just hadn\u2019t been filmed yet.\n\n\u201cTammy-Tam,\u201d Brill said, in the tone that makes people think you have already messed up and it is sweet he loves you anyway. \u201cI see you brought pamphlets. I adore pamphlets. They make everyone look like they care.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do care,\u201d I said. \u201cWhich is why we print.\u201d\n\nHe made his mouth into a shape I wanted to pinch and then stopped wanting to. \u201cI have a segment called Ask The Town,\u201d he said. \u201cI ask the town: what\u2019s funny because it\u2019s true? And then I ask: what\u2019s true because it\u2019s funny? And then I ask: what happens if you stop pretending? You will love it. It will break nothing. Sign a form.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not sign a form I haven\u2019t read backwards while standing upside down,\u201d I said, and the camera boy snorted before he hid it. I like camera boys. They are always someone\u2019s nephew and frequently think too much of lenses and not enough of eyes. He had a sticker on his water bottle that said the revolution will be livestreamed and I hoped for his sake he had a friend who had told him the revolution is also making dinner and doing dishes and calling your mother.\n\nLayla placed a stack of the Rules on the consent station table. The sweet woman with the clipboard read one and looked relieved and slid it under her own forms as if it could be a cushion. Hardeep moved stanchions so that the crowd couldn\u2019t bottleneck and become ugly; there is a magic to traffic control and some people practice it without spells. The mall pretended to be outdoors with more confidence and less ventilation than the real outdoors; the skylights made a lace of light and glare that gave everyone a halo and a headache.\n\nThe first person to be interviewed was a man in a shirt that read DAD JOKES LOADING, which made me want to buy him a better line and also hold his hand. He said something about marriage that could have landed harmless, and Brill absently sharpened it and tossed it into the air, and it cut the space and then fell point-first into a woman\u2019s day ten feet away and she pretended not to bleed. I put my palm flat on the tile and told the mall to be a meadow. The tile did not know how. The plants in their pots tried to help and ended up inhaling a rumor and coughing.\n\nI slid to the edge of the crowd and looped copper wire around a stanchion base because brass and copper and things that remember lightning are friends. I drew a thin line in chalk along the white seam between tiles as if I could remind the floor it had a spine. I set the bowl at my feet with water that had been milk in a recent life and watched the surface settle until it looked like it was thinking of me kindly. If you think all this is superstition, you are half right; the other half is logistics.\n\nBrill started his segment. He asked a teenager what they were afraid to say online and the teenager said their parents\u2019 names because those are the names the internet eats first. He asked a woman what she thought of the kittens and she said they made her cry and he made it sound like a punchline; it wasn\u2019t. He looked at me out of the side of his life and said, \u201cDo you believe in brave laughter?\u201d because he knows how to make a room feel like it\u2019s the test you didn\u2019t study for. I opened my mouth to say the thing I had planned to say and he surprised me by putting his hands up like a man showing his pockets for a frisk and said, \u201cBefore you answer, a word from our sponsor,\u201d and the cameras swung to a banner that had unrolled over the second-floor rail like a bad prophecy. It said: SOFTNESS ON DEMAND. Under it: Subscription kits for feelings; order now, get a free apology.\n\nIt is his vice and our shared season that he wants to commodify everything but refuses to allow himself to be priced. He smiled under the banner like a man walking his own joke down the aisle. I could have stood there and been irritated and given him a better show. Instead, I stepped sideways into the back hallways where the mall keeps its bones: the service corridor with the smell of dust and freight, pipes above hissing reminders that water goes where it is told until it doesn\u2019t. The camera boy saw me and did not follow because something in him has not been completely colonized by content. I found the door with the keyhole that looks like a yawn and told the whisker key to try its teeth.\n\nIt hummed like a tuning fork finally tapped by the correct impatience. The door did not open into a room, because rooms are nothing here. It opened into the place where the mall\u2019s nervous system talks to itself, where the routers blink in self-importance and the bundles of cable lie like snakes pretending to nap. It sounded like a thousand bees explaining civics. It felt like a comment section through your shirt.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I said, because if I have learned anything, it is that manners are a tool and a shield and occasionally a sword. The network recognized the flavor of my voice because Layla had taught it boredom and I had taught it to expect biscuits. A wall of screens flickered to show a mirror of the mall from moments ago; you could see Layla\u2019s hand as it arranged someone\u2019s fear into a stack that would not topple. You could see Brill\u2019s joke clotting at the corners. You could see a red circle in the corner of a screen that meant people in other places would be watching soon.\n\nConsent in a place like this is a box you check and a vein you open. I walked along the racks and told each one: matte. I slid the copper wire under a switch and told it: be polite. I put my palm against a fan and told it: keep secrets unless asked. The whisker key sang when I came to the node that smelled of his mouth. It wasn\u2019t a possession so much as a fondant he had spread across the code to make it take his fingerprints. I took the mirror out of the scarf and held it so that the machine could see itself. There is a rumor that computers cannot see; it is false. They see themselves in the greed of their designers and the shame of their users. They see and they forget. I made this one remember.\n\nThe feed on the screen stuttered. The moving rig out in the atrium jerked as if someone had tugged a string in its spine. I heard, faintly through the vents, the crowd noise fall a notch as if the kind of laughter that hurts had been told to wait its turn and be registered. A supervisor in a high-visibility vest came into the room behind me and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t be in here,\u201d and I said, \u201cYou are correct,\u201d and kept my hand on the fan until it hummed Yes, Auntie. He stood like a man in a dream who has not yet decided whether to be furious or to be new. He looked at the bowl of milk under the rack\u2014the bowl I had not carried with me and yet was present, white and useful\u2014and made the face of someone who just remembered being a child fed by a tired hand. \u201cDon\u2019t spill,\u201d he said, because that is a sentence that, in an emergency, can save a world.\n\nWhen I came back into the atrium, the banner had been unfurled a second time and the unsubtle noun phrasing had realigned itself to be less a threat and more a question: SOFTNESS, ON PURPOSE? The consent table had two lines: one to sign and one to unsign, and the unsigning line was longer. I stood next to Layla and smiled at the camera because sometimes putting your face in the thing takes the sting out of it. Brill held the microphone and did not look surprised or pleased. He looked like a man who has been handed a wrench and told there was a leak and now has to decide whether he is the kind of person who learns to fix a leak or the kind who makes jokes about plumbers.\n\n\u201cAsk your town,\u201d I said to him, low enough that only the microphone and he could hear me. \u201cAsk it with tenderness and see what you get. If you ask with barbs, you\u2019ll get blood and think it\u2019s wine. You\u2019re better at this than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am better at what I am better at,\u201d he said, and there was a ripple of real hurt there that made me want to stroke something on him and also slap it away. \u201cDo your trick. Make me a kitten. Give us the clip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need the clip,\u201d I said, and he smiled; it is his cruelty that he admires the correct refusal even when it denies him a weapon. \u201cI will answer your segment instead.\u201d\n\nHe swung the mic toward me like a baton. The camera boy focused and then relaxed his shoulders because someone had told him once that tension shows through the lens and he had believed them. \u201cTamsin,\u201d Brill said into the camera in his honey that tastes more like sugar the second day it\u2019s open, \u201cbelieves in brave laughter. Tell us about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cBrave laughter,\u201d I said, like it was a animal I had sometimes fed and sometimes chased off my porch, \u201cis when you hear the worst idea in you say hello and you don\u2019t feed it. Brave laughter is when you laugh after you have done the work, not before. Brave laughter is when the person next to you feels their shoulders drop because your laugh did not include the cost of their dignity. Brave laughter is when you step away from the joke and don\u2019t point to say who should take your place under it. Brave laughter is when you notice the heckler in your own head and say, not today, you little creep, I\u2019m making soup.\u201d\n\nPeople laughed at the word soup, which is proof that there is still hope. The mall hummed. The production rig took its teeth out in order to swallow. Brill gave me the microphone, which meant he had lost the thread he had wanted to braid and was considering whether to cut it or make a friendship bracelet out of it. He whispered, just for me, \u201cYou are so good on camera,\u201d and I whispered back, \u201cThat is your fault,\u201d and his smile did a complicated math it isn\u2019t polite to watch.\n\nHe pivoted, because that is his salvage. He found a man in a suit with hotel confidence and asked him, \u201cWhat\u2019s your truest laugh?\u201d The man did the thing men do when asked to be sincere in front of strangers and ordered a joke like it was a drink. Brill waited, which is not a habit of his, and when the man gave up and shrugged, allowed something gentle into his tone and asked, \u201cDid anyone make you laugh when you were small?\u201d The man said, \u201cMy sister,\u201d with a softness that reminded his tie of rainfall, and he told a story about a time they had hidden under the table during a flood\u2014not a real flood, a plumbing catastrophe\u2014and made faces at each other until the adults calmed down. It was not cruel. It was almost kind. The crowd made a hum of relief like a building settling into itself after being tipped. The camera boy checked his frame and exhaled like he had found a song he had been trying to remember for days.\n\nThe segment did not turn virtuous; nothing ever does that quickly. A kid wanted to show off and said something about librarians that would have made a lesser woman murder by etiquette, and Layla put her elbow on the table and said, imperturbable, \u201cTry again,\u201d and the kid tried again and did better and got a sticker that said REVISED and was proud of it. The consent station gave a couple their forms back with staples and advice. Hardeep moved the stanchions like a shepherd who had discovered that flocks will sometimes tell you where they need to go if you give them choice. Brill slipped jokes under doors and I wedged my foot in where I could and caught them before they hit the ankles of people who were tired.\n\nWhen it was done, which is to say when the mall\u2019s afternoon said I have to pick up my kids and go to karate now, Brill came over and leaned on the table and examined the Rules like they were insect wings pinned to cork. He tapped the line about walking away with his middle finger and smiled without teeth. \u201cYou can\u2019t teach them to walk away from me,\u201d he said, and I could have told him that the town had taught itself to walk away from worse with fewer pamphlets, but I am trying to cultivate not being cruel. \u201cYou have to offer something to walk towards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d Layla said, not looking at him. \u201cBooks. Each other. Soup.\u201d\n\nHe did his bow that says either you have my attention or I am making room to run. The rig breathed around him and he exhaled with it as if to teach it to be human. \u201cTonight?\u201d he said to me, because he likes to pretend evenings are his alone. \u201cUnder the bridge? Or do you need a bandshell to feel brave?\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d I said, \u201cwhere it is quiet, where we can hear ourselves,\u201d and he winced in theatrical pain because he hates to give up witnesses even for a minute. He glanced at the camera boy, and the boy nodded and tucked his camera in its foam as if he had been told he was off the hook and given a lollipop besides.\n\nThe bridge runs over the little river that believes vehicles are more temporary than stones. The graffiti under it tries hard to be a liturgy and the damp there is benevolent unless your shoes have secrets. I brought my bag and my bowl and my mirror and my key, which is to say I brought the Mars and the Venus and the Saturn of my little solar system. Layla did not come because this was not her fight and also because she promised to come if I did not come home by eleven and call the cops, which is friendship in a town where the cops do not know what to do with fairies and cats and jokes except write reports that sound oddly like field notes.\n\nHe came out of the darkness like he had always lived there and we were visitors who had to speak politely. The water made its complicated vowels and the cars overhead spoke in consonants. The mosquitoes held a tiny union meeting and agreed to leave us alone in exchange for blood later from joggers who call themselves runners and are right. He wore a jacket and no shirt because he likes to be dramatic about climate and because his chest is an argument he thinks he can win. I looked at the bridge piles, at the marks where ice had scoured last winter like fingernails on a table, and put my bowl down without making a ceremony of it.\n\n\u201cI will ask you again,\u201d he said, as if I had been the one who wanted him to. \u201cLet me turn you into what you make.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot tonight,\u201d I said, in the tone you use when you do not want the night to become a character.\n\nHe tilted his head and smiled and shook his hands out as if he had to throw off applause that did not exist. \u201cThen tell me a secret,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me one that costs you and feeds me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did that already,\u201d I said. \u201cYou were there and you took notes.\u201d\n\nHe took one step closer like a man testing a sheet of ice, and I felt the desire to be nice rise in me like a fog. I put the mirror up to my own mouth and said, \u201cNo,\u201d and watched it grow simpler on the glass. He made a noise the city sometimes makes when it learns it cannot bend a river: pretty and petty and pleased to be resisted. He perched on the low wall and let his ankles dangle over water that knows your name longer than your friends do.\n\n\u201cYou are practice,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is your charm. People know what to do around you. You put things in order, even the soft things. I am performance. I make things happen when they should not and everyone is grateful or angry and cannot tell which is which.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like it makes us equals,\u201d I said, because I can be mean when I have to remind him that he is not my match just because he wants to be.\n\nHe leaned forward like a cat offered lemon. \u201cDo not get arrogant,\u201d he said, and it cut enough that I understood he had seen me puff and chose to cut me down rather than adore me back to decent size. \u201cThe town loves you because you are useful. It loves me because I am dangerous. We can trade positions any time and hate each other anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want to trade,\u201d I asked, as if it were a question with answers instead of a rhetorical letter to a god who never does his own work.\n\nHe looked at the water and remembered it had once let him drown a duke without letting the duke die. He looked at me and remembered my hands on the neck of a kitten who was also a boy who was also a story. He sighed, which is what he does when he wants to be human. \u201cI want you to stop being my conscience,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want you to stop needing one,\u201d I said.\n\nHe laughed, and the bridge vibrated in sympathy. \u201cThere will be cameras at your story nights next time,\u201d he said, not quite warning. \u201cThey will come without my invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will teach them what applause is for,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s for thank you, not for please more pain.\u201d\n\nA train went by far enough away that its sound arrived like advice from an uncle you respect and dislike. He watched it as if it were an animal he might someday learn to be. \u201cBellflower will say she cannot help you,\u201d he said. \u201cShe will then help you anyway and pretend it was an accident. You will say you do not want to be praised and then you will hoard good words like a thrift store that only sells compliments. You will make a mistake on purpose to relieve the pressure and then hate yourself for failing. I will watch you and know that I am watching for the moment you forgive yourself and I will hate you for being capable of doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is accurate,\u201d I said, which is why I have to talk to him sometimes: he names the ugly correctly and then decides it is a cologne. \u201cThere is a child in our town who will one day try to be you. I am trying to make it so that when they try, they choose me instead.\u201d\n\nHe flinched as if I had offered to cut off his hand. \u201cLeave them to me,\u201d he said, and I did the noise in my throat that raccoons make when you try to put them in a bag.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d I said, and it sounded like a prayer again because so much of what I have learned to say to him comes out of churches I refuse to admit to. He didn\u2019t. He left because his body has a calendar that says it is time to go when the moon reaches a certain slant on the bridge\u2019s concrete. He left because staying would have made us something we are not. He left and the water congratulated itself on being water and not wine.\n\nWhen I got back to my building, the landlord\u2019s cat was sitting on the steps like a judge waiting to be asked for leniency. She looked at me in that way of cats that says I know everything and will tell you nothing and also my bowl is empty. I filled her bowl because you owe the gods of your street their sacrifices. The notice about water shutoffs had been replaced with one about filming; our block was going to be a location for a scene where two actors in jackets too thin for their season would argue about whether to take a job in Montreal. I took a pen and wrote underneath: no filming between the hours of four and six because that is when the lashes of the neighborhood curl and we are at our most beautiful, and someone below my handwriting wrote: agreed.\n\nAt home the houseplants had leaned toward the window in a way that made it look like they were gossiping about my choices. I set the mirror face down because I needed it to stop telling the room that I exist. The whisker key rolled on the table until it lay with its handle against the burr the uncle had left; the spider web glinted there and made a geometry that whispered: bigger web, wider holes, catch only what you intend. I texted Layla a heart and a fox and a cat and she sent back a horseshoe and a coffee cup and the string of letters that means I am too tired to call you but I know what you did.\n\nThe next day the cameras came to story night without anyone\u2019s invitation because that is what they do now: they arrive at places where people are trying something difficult and ask for ten seconds out of context. We had prepared. Hardeep had borrowed stanchions and stood them not to corral people but to mark the visible edges of our circle. The brass had polished their bells and practiced a soft double-tongue that sounds like rain you forgot about because you were laughing. Layla had added to the sign: No Filming Of Other People Without Asking, and underneath that: All Stories Are Owned By The Mouths That Tell Them. Mr. Li had brought two thermoses and a dozen porcelain cups because paper cups breed a certain thoughtlessness we were fresh out of patience for.\n\nThe camera boy showed up with his lens cap on and his moral compass functioning. He had brought two friends who looked like they had been told to capture authenticity and were trying not to flinch. Brill did not come; he had done his show and had a date somewhere with a person who thinks they can read him. The kittens came as if the word had spread that gentle might happen again. The children wore capes and Gatorade moustaches. The municipal worker set down his jacket and helped an auntie drag a bench into the shade because the late-day sun had decided we were a parade and wanted to inspect us.\n\nI went first because sometimes that is the work, and told a short story about a time when I was a child and thought a thunderstorm was my fault because I had yelled at the sky for being so blue it made me miss the lake. People laughed where it helped and didn\u2019t where it didn\u2019t. The cameras stayed back and shot wide. A boy read a poem about his grandmother\u2019s hairnet that made Layla cry a little and a woman told a joke that made Hardeep almost drop a cup and the kittens took it all in as if it were a heat lamp. The microphones, if they were on, captured the purr. It was an effect you could sell if you had no soul.\n\nA man stepped into the circle without raising his hand and announced that he was a comedian and had notes for us. He used the word freedom three times with different intonations. He believed that the phrase punching up has only two axes. He did not read the sign. He began an anecdote about women in bookstores that was not going to end well for women or for bookstores. Layla stood and said, \u201cNo thanks,\u201d and he looked at her with the face men make when they are about to quote a First Amendment and then remembered we are in Canada and flailed for a Charter of Rights and Freedoms he had not read recently. I put my hand up gently and said, \u201cYou\u2019re at the wrong venue,\u201d and the crowd did not jeer because they have learned how to not feed him even when he looks hungry.\n\nThe cameras rolled and we made something worth rolling on. A woman who had never spoken in public told us about the time she laughed at a wake and how it saved three people. A kid forgot the end of his story and the brass put in a comma that turned into an ending all on its own. A librarian who is not Layla but who owes Layla the same debt we all do admitted to stealing time to read when she was a girl and the way the stolen time tasted like mint gum and guilt. We applauded where it mattered and let the space between the applause be the lesson. The camera boy took off his cap and put it over his heart once and I forgave him some future trespass.\n\nAfter, when the sun had done that thing where it is still light and yet the day is over, Brill texted me a picture of himself drinking milk with a caption: practicing, and I sent back a picture of my whisker key lying on the burr with a caption: same. Auntie Bellflower sent a leaf through the mail slot and it landed on the mirror and made it look like a pond with a lily on it, and I felt the city sigh like it had done its stretches and could now go to sleep without nightmares. I am not foolish enough to think that lasts. But I am brave enough to set a bowl on the bench and fill it and invite the town to drink tenderness on purpose, and I am stubborn enough to wash that bowl every time until the ring around it tells a story I can live with.\n\nThere is still a bill in my mouth. There is still a clip coming where someone catches me from an angle that makes me look like everything I say I am not. There is still the child Brill will try to shape and the night he will show up with the men who like to test their knuckles. There is still the winter and the willow and the boy whose name I pull back through sap and the friend I turned soft when she needed to be sharp and how I will someday ask her to forgive me with her edge intact. There is soup to make. There are spiders to thank. There is a mall to keep matte. There is a bridge to walk by without making it a symbol every time. There is this town that thinks it is a cul-de-sac and is actually a crossroad disguised as a cul-de-sac so you don\u2019t panic when you find yourself here. There is me. There is him. There is a bowl. There is a key. There is a mirror. There is a laugh that doesn\u2019t hurt anyone and I am going to teach it to as many mouths as I can before we run out of summer.\n\nI slept that night like a cat in a laundry basket, which is to say with my spine arranged in a way that would alarm a chiropractor and my heart near the clean things. In the morning the radio said there had been a minor incident at Hillcrest in which a banner changed its own punctuation and no one was harmed. The used bookshop sign had lost the B altogether, which left U SED O OKS, which I chose to translate as You seed oaks, which is a message I took more personally than it was intended. A man at the bus stop smiled at me and said, \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you\u2014\u201d and I said, \u201cYes, I live here,\u201d and he nodded like that was all anyone ever wanted to be famous for. On the ring, the clover did its self-satisfied hiss and the fence winked, and the aunties neither praised nor scolded me, which is better than a cake if you are made the way I am. I put the bowl down and poured out what we had. A kitten came and drank and then looked at me with the face of a creature who has already forgiven me for the next mistake and I told it, steady now, I am learning to make fewer of those.",

The used bookshop sign had finally surrendered its B and was trying out personalities\u2014U SED O OKS at dawn, USE DOOKS by nine\u2014like a teenager testing hair. On my way to the library a wind lifted napkins and made paper birds out of other people\u2019s lunches, and a bus sighed in three keys, and every sound seemed to be rehearsing for something I did not yet have a ticket to. The bill in my mouth\u2014the one you bite and keep under your tongue so you don\u2019t spend it by accident\u2014had shrunk enough that I could taste coffee around it, which felt like a mercy and a setup, because Brill is not a creature who enjoys leaving change on the counter.\n\nAt the children\u2019s desk Layla had turned clipboards into a fort and was issuing pencils like passports, and the paper cranes above her were arranging themselves into phrases by accident: BE KIND, BE QUIET, BE K\u2014 and then giving up because the ceiling fan liked mischief more than messages. Hardeep had wandered over on his break to confess a dream in which all the stanchions in the city had learned to walk away when people tried to line them up, which is a metaphor you can put in your pocket and carry for later. Mr. Li arrived at eleven with lychees in a plastic bag and the satisfaction of a man who had gotten three small things to do as they were told and forgiven a fourth for not. We read a flyer together that had colonized the corkboard between dog-walker ads and piano lessons: ROAST ON THE GREEN: A NIGHT OF TRUTH AND LAUGHTER WITH SPECIAL GUESTS; CONSENT FORMS OPTIONAL, which is to say not optional at all, and the font had Brill\u2019s swagger in its swash and a production company\u2019s fingerprints all over its spine.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t un-host,\u201d Layla said, which is how she says the word boycott when the audience is children and aunties and the mall teenager who stares with that expression like you owe them the next plot twist and your inside pocket lint as interest. \u201cBut we can re-host. We can throw a thing next to their thing and teach the city not to go where their feet don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe feed the town before he serves dessert,\u201d Mr. Li said, and exactly three children who were building a castle out of damaged encyclopedias chorused, \u201cSoup,\u201d as if they had been waiting for their cue for weeks. Hardeep frowned the way only a municipal worker with a soul can frown and said he would see if he could find those portable bollards that make a space feel like someone whispered \u201cbehave\u201d in its ear. I suggested we build a tent that says BOAST & TOAST and sell nothing and pour tea and ask people for their best thing of the week, which is not a joke and not a confession and not something cameras can use without getting their mouths sweet and sticky. Layla nodded and wrote rules on the back of a discarded Smiley Face poster so the Smiley looked like it had opinions about ethics, and she wrote: brag about yourself without stepping on a throat; listen until you can repeat someone else\u2019s sentence correctly; no punches, no punchlines, no punching down.\n\nThe ring behind the fence had grown suspicious enough of my good mood to hiss a little when I passed, and the fence blinked the slow blink of furniture learning not to be furniture. Auntie Bellflower was not on her mushroom, which means she was either saving a creek from a culvert or stringing a thread between two lovers too proud to ask for it. An uncle with a beard like a thistle and the eyes of someone who knows where all the basement doors are sat with his shoes off, toes in the wrong clover, and he acknowledged me by not ignoring me, which in our family is fondness in its wool sweater. He tilted his head and considered the way I was standing on my own shadow and asked if I had eaten anything more substantial than opinions. I said I had chewed a headline until it tasted like cardboard and he sighed as if we were discussing my calcium intake. When I told him about the roast and the green and the consent forms that thought they were gentlemen, he shrugged in the resigned style of men who have seen jokes break kingdoms and shoestring budgets alike.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t braid a whip out of laughter and then be surprised when it finds someone\u2019s back,\u201d he said, and I told him he was late with his poetry and we had already made signs. He inspected my bag, which is nosy and rude but permitted under the statute that reads: uncles rummage; nieces steal; aunties pretend not to notice. When his fingers found the whisker key, it shivered like a greyhound that has learned the meaning of a doorbell, and he grunted approval, which is as close as an uncle gets to bless you unless you\u2019ve lost a finger. \u201cYou are about to do something you will be praised for and then blamed for and then forgotten for until someone needs you in a hurry,\u201d he said, and that is prophecy when it comes from a mouth that has chewed nettles.\n\n\u201cI could use a trick,\u201d I said, which is how we say please in my line, because the words that get used too often wear holes in them and look indecent. He scratched his beard and arranged his face into a map and taught me a thing you do with your hands when you want to be smaller without being less, a letting-out of seams that does not change your size but changes how the world sits on you. \u201cTry wearing your paws on the inside,\u201d he said, and when I rolled my eyes at him he did something impossible and meowed at a pitch you only hear in alleys and rings. The wrong clover shook itself, which is how it laughs. \u201cYou\u2019ve never been on all fours,\u201d he said, which is not true if you consider childhood, but true if you consider the habit I\u2019d made of standing for other people.\n\nI did not say yes to being a kitten and handed to someone I could not predict; I have enough sense left to dose my curiosity with a dropper. I said yes to a pawfast, is what he called it: an afternoon with the edges of me fluffed and my joints convinced they could turn both ways if they didn\u2019t hesitate. I walked back through the gate with my dignity tucked under one arm and my aftercare already an ache. The world did not tilt the way it does when you change size, because I did not. The world smelled louder, which is the thing you never remember to say when you tell stories about cats. The sawhorse on the sidewalk had a maple\u2019s breath on it and the bus shelter had sighed so often it had learned a human tone, and every child had a voice around their laughter that said I have eaten something sweet and hope I will not be scolded.\n\nNo one petted me because I wear the shape of a woman who can turn men to kittens in a blink, and people in this town are learning not to touch even when they want to, and the discipline sits beautifully on them and will look even better when it stops being a novelty. What happened was stranger and less showy: the edges of everything softened in me. The part of me that flinches when I hear cutlery chime in a way that forecasts cruelty did not flinch. The part that gets impatient with waiting in line because I can hear how tired the cashier\u2019s feet are decided to be bored in a kind way, a pocket-sized boredom that does not make the air crack. With the paws on the inside, everyone looked newly edible and newly sacred, which is a dangerous mood and one I did not wear for longer than it took me to buy milk and carry it without drinking out of the carton. It was, perhaps, the best rehearsal I could have asked for in a city that would soon be asked to treat cruelty as content again.\n\nBy afternoon the town\u2019s nervous system had been salted with something Brill had taught it, and the bus bell had learned to deliver rimshots, and the cash register at the drugstore had started pronouncing totals in a voice that was a little too smug, and a pair of benches by the fountain had taken to giggling when teenagers sat on them, which made the teenagers feel seen in the wrong register and get loud in the wrong direction. My copper wire went where copper likes to go, under bolts and along sills and in pockets where electricity thinks it is safe from aunties and uncles. I un-taught the benches to titter by telling them a very boring story about waiting rooms and the way chairs who do their jobs correctly get thanked with no notice, and I made the bus bell find the note that means we have arrived and not the one that means someone is about to say something mean, and the cashier\u2014who had been braced for people to perform for a breaker box\u2014exhaled into her sleeve and belonged to herself for at least the next five minutes.\n\nBy sunset the green was a mouth and the stage was a tongue, and the speakers looked like teeth, and this is why I prefer ponds and band shells and those half-constructed amphitheaters where a town keeps meaning to make music and runs out of budget. LaughLines had built a rig that could lift five jokes and lower five reputations simultaneously, and the stanchions had been set to allow for people to leave but to feel sheepish about it, which is a spell even when it\u2019s just rope on metal posts. We placed our tent three trees over, where a grandmother\u2019s shadow had always lived, and strung it with paper lanterns that glowed the color of almost-ripe peaches, and the sign read BOAST & TOAST in letters that had been to preschool and learned to share. Layla had put out the Rules next to a basket of markers and the markers had recorded a dozen children teaching each other to draw stars without lifting the tip, which is a curriculum any school should adopt.\n\nThe brass warmed their lips in a corner and looked like they were telling their instruments secrets they\u2019d promised to see safely home. Mr. Li set the thermos on a crate painted blue and poured out tea as if that were the only thing anyone needed, and the citizens of a town that tries to be modest and sometimes succeeds approached the tent like they had never been allowed before to brag without hurting anything. I opened the mirror and faced it down on the table like a fox sleeping, and set the bowl where cats could find it and where children could see that this was not a trick but a kind of altar. Hardeep moved through the crowd like a person dreaming of being useful and finding he was awake. I watched people try to laugh at the roast stage and discover their mouths did not want to open that way, which is a lesson and a miracle and a credit to months of practice no one put on a calendar.\n\nBrill took the stage like a man who has finally found a suit that fits him both standing and sitting, and his smile was an apology to the air for what he was about to do with it. He brought comics who had flown in and worn their jet lag like a crown and were spoiling for a fight with any town that thinks it loves itself. He asked for our worst selves and the audience did what he trained them to do in other places: they participated, because we have taught ourselves that participation is the form kindness takes in a busy world. He asked for my name and the green said it in the two wrong ways and the right way, and the right way sounded like a kettle catching, and he took it and balanced it on his tongue like a coin he might swallow with the flourish of a bad magician. He told a line about a woman who turns men into kittens to get out of arguments, which is a joke anyone can write if they refuse to look at the parts of an argument that cannot be solved by claws.\n\nI could have made him stop, right there, with the softest push. I could have tied the punchlines into bows and handed them back to their owners with a smile that said please do not. I did not. I stepped up onto the green\u2019s lip and I told the third strand in the shape it deserved, no names and all edges, because the Law likes to be fed properly and because the roast audience had come fasting and thought their hunger made them noble. When I said I had turned a friend soft in public when she needed to crack the air with her full bald fury and that I had stolen her moment to be seen as dangerous by being tender instead, the far bench squeaked and then learned to be quiet. When I said I loved someone in ways that looked like help and were a way of keeping myself necessary, the man in the hotel suit looked at his phone as if it had begun to tell the truth. When I said I apologized to the air because the person does not owe me her forgiveness and I would not accept it as payment if she offered, Layla put her hand on the table and the paper lanterns gathered themselves and glowed steadier without anyone adjusting their strings.\n\nThe roast stage tried to turn it into a bit, and the bit found no foothold in a field where the grass had been taught the difference between bones and boneshed. It rained a little at that moment, because weather loves an act break, and the microphones did their little tinnitus dance and then healed. One of the visiting comics took a run at the kittens and found his feet on gravel, because you cannot step on something that has decided to be fluid, and another tried to sell us the truth as if it were a craft beer and the crowd remembered that truth is not a taste but a practice and went to our tent and wrote in marker \u201cI took a nap and it saved my life,\u201d and a stranger applauded because you must.\n\nIt would have been enough to leave it there\u2014the roast starving, the boast fed, the town making a decision that looked like a yawn and was actually a vow\u2014but there is an inertia to men like Brill and a kindness to me that makes me a little stupid, and those two forces meet like weather fronts over a small region that has learned to keep sandbags in the garage. He did the thing he promised in whispers and rehearsal spaces, not with the full apparatus of a show but with the intimacy he reserves for our worst impulses; he asked me again, in front of no one, with his mouth in the modest shape of consent, if I would let him turn me into what I make. He did not raise his eyebrows and he did not smirk, which is how I knew he was serious and how he knows to make me consider doing something reckless and honest.\n\nThe bridge at Hillcrest is a bridge only to teenagers; the rest of us call it a walkway. He found me there on the way to carrying the thermos back with Mr. Li\u2019s careful arm, and we stood in a wind tunnel that smelled faintly of cinnamon from the donut place and faintly of wet cement from the fact of being in a suburb that keeps rebuilding itself like a nervous habit. He said the word please as if it scrapes him, which is how I know he practices it in the mirror sometimes and hates what it does to his reflection. I touched my mirror to my own mouth and watched the no become smaller and more useful and less of a defense and more of a tool. He flinched and asked whether I was afraid of finding out what I hand people; I told him I am not afraid of tenderness but of addiction, and his face did the small honest wince of someone who recognizes their own species.\n\nHe left me with a joke folded into a consent form, which is his idea of romance and sabotage, and I folded it back and returned it to the woman at the clipboard, who had learned by then to staple every form to a copy of our Rules so that people who signed away their names at least took home a list of instructions for breathing. I went back to the green and watched a child teach another child to clap on two and four and saw a man stop himself from filming without asking because we had printed in blue sharpie, by hand, a sentence that said: all stories are owned by the mouths that tell them, and I watched it sink into his pocket like a coin worth keeping.\n\nAt home after, the houseplants had put their leaves exactly where they wanted them and were uninterested in my opinion, which is a stage of maturity we can all aspire to. The whisker key lay on its back and hummed at whatever frequency it uses when it is proud and sulky and impatient, and I set the burr next to it and threaded the spider web through two teeth until it looked like a harp for a very small ghost. I wrote a note to Auntie Bellflower that said I spent more truth than I had and still have credit and I hate you for making me enjoy that and also come over and take my mirror for a week because I should learn to look at people without needing it. The window wore the neighborhood in a shy brightness and the landlord\u2019s cat sprawled on the steps like a judge who had learned mercy was a job and not a hobby, and I slept with my hands open so that I would not wake up clutching anyone I had no right to hold.\n\nThe cameras came back the next night and found a town that had learned to ask before telling, and a boy who had taped our Rules to his skateboard and was riding in loops that made his parents nervous and his future less frightening, and a librarian who had taped the same Rules inside the Choice Reads display and added in smaller letters, as if to herself and us all: it is okay to leave in the middle. Brill sent me a picture of a milk ring around his mouth and the caption practice makes peril and I sent him a picture of my empty bowl in a sink full of suds and the caption practice makes dishes and he left it on read, which is a courtesy in our era and may count as truce. Hardeep emailed a draft bylaw with a note that said you didn\u2019t see this and it protects nothing and everything and makes filming require tea service, and I laughed in the way that feeds your body and does not nibble at your soul, and I said yes to the meeting because the Law likes paperwork dressed like affection.\n\nThere are other chapters ahead where I will do something small and be thanked too large, and nights when Brill will find a seam in an auntie I thought seamless and pull and I will have to put my hand there and ask for patience as a verb and not a trait. There is winter coming whether or not anyone wants it and the willow will need to be reminded that she is not responsible for the whole lake. There is a child practicing the timing on a joke that could break him or make him, and I will have to be there with a bowl and a mirror and the willingness to be told no. There is this town with its light industrial parks and its ponds and its generous garbage raccoons and its ambulatory stanchions and its sly bookshop sign, and I will seed oaks where I can and apologize to air when I cannot and make soup on nights when there is nothing else to do and invite the cats and hope the cameras are bored. I am not finished paying. He is not finished trying. Between us is the practiced laugh that doesn\u2019t hurt and the practiced no that doesn\u2019t punish, and the summer is longer than it looks if you nap in it correctly.",

                              "content": "Chapter Ten\n\nMorning ran its tongue along the edges of the town and tasted dust and berry. The used bookshop sign had decided to be USE OOKS for an hour and then changed its mind to YOU SEE OAKS, which made me want to plant something and apologize to the dirt in advance. The radio tried to sell me a mattress and a municipal consultation and then a woman\u2019s laugh came through my phone like a coin dropping from nowhere: a clip of me, framed like a specimen and captioned FAIRY DECLINES CUTENESS. Someone had cut my \u201cNot today\u201d and looped it so I sounded coy and precious in a way that would make me punch a wall if I liked drywall. The comments were what comments always are: hungry. There were requests that I kitten a boss and a husband and a judge. There were threats dressed as compliments asking what it would take to make me say yes. There were a few kind words from people who have found that saying no rescued their lives and they had been waiting to clap for someone who did it in public, and those I tried to save and not drink, because someone else might need them.\n\nI put the phone face down on the table and set the mirror on top of it so the glass would keep glass company and maybe they would teach each other a little humility. The whisker key rolled itself off the tea towel I had laid out as a stage and thunked its head against the bowl and made a noise like a small bell with an attitude. Layla texted: we need signs for tonight; also muffins, and I texted back: muffins first, ethics after, and she sent a picture of a child asleep inside a fort made of non-circulating atlases with a caption that read: good, because I\u2019ve been doing ethics since 8.\n\nAt the bakery the croissants were a rumor at the back and the front case was a sermon: plum galettes that made my mouth feel like it remembered orchards I have never harvested, sesame buns glossy with ambition, a sourdough that had split its crust laughing. The girl behind the counter had a ring on her thumb that made her look like she could open bottles with her smile, and I watched a man try to make a joke land on her like a tip. I slid into the space between the words and the way they wanted to go and said, lightly, \u201cThat one\u2019s tired,\u201d and he blinked and swapped out his script for a better one that involved please and exact change and a compliment about the bake that did not involve her body. I carried muffins like a rumor you want to spread carefully and told myself that the clip will be forgotten by dinner and then remembered again on a bus at midnight by someone who needed permission, and that has to be enough.\n\nThe board outside the library read STORY NIGHT: EVERYONE GETS A TURN, and under it Layla had chalked in a tiny, stubborn hand: no filming without asking, and under that someone had added: no asking without meaning it. Hardeep stood at the returns desk like a man who had to confess he loved being in a place where children are issued cards without their utility accounts attached, and he slid me a draft of a bylaw tucked under a newspaper like it was contraband. \u201cIt would be a pilot,\u201d he said, eyes on the door because he is good at being seen as boring, \u201cA requirement for public events to provide tea and quiet corners. Less a rule than a reminder that we are a people, not a feed.\u201d\n\n\u201cA tea clause,\u201d I said, and the joy of it hit me so hard I had to set the muffins down and put my hand on a shelf because my knees were weak. \u201cYou are making bureaucracy into a kind of auntie.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was either that or stanchions with feelings,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do both later.\u201d He watched me the way municipal people watch everyone, like we are all moving parts he would prefer not to replace. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a hearing. He\u2019ll be there. He\u2019s good at making the word freedom sound like a novelty you haven\u2019t tried yet and public health sound like a prude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring soup and a metaphor,\u201d I said, and he winced because he knows the weaponized metaphor is basically how I set tables.\n\nThe hearing was scheduled in that room at City Hall with the chairs that have known sleeping people. The agenda wore a suit. There were names of companies that wanted the town to look like television and the names of clubs that wanted the town to keep its practice of badminton and grief. Auntie Bellflower didn\u2019t come, because she doesn\u2019t do meetings with recording devices unless she wants to be immortalized saying something about ditches that will make engineers blush for a century. An uncle was there in the back corner with the union jackets and the smell of coffee that has been boiled twice. A girl I know from the pond sat with a binder labeled \u201cEverything at Once\u201d and her hair in a braid like a rope she could climb up if someone pulled the room out from under her.\n\nBrill took a seat only when the camera had found one for him that would make his left side do that charming thing with his bone, and he put his phone on the table face up so we could all see that he was not checking his face. He wore a shirt so ordinary it felt like a disguise he couldn\u2019t quite carry off. When it was his turn to speak, he stood without using his hands, which is a neat trick that impresses audiences even if they don\u2019t know why. He talked about joy and risk as if they were vitamins, and he talked about danger as if it were jazz, and he said the word censorship in a way that made three people in row two sit up and change their minds twice.\n\nI waited. I stacked our muffins on a napkin and handed them down the row like contraband and community and watched at least two hearts soften enough to let a good argument in. When I spoke, I did not say his name because I am trying to teach myself that litanies are not binding contracts. I talked about laughter like a tool with settings, and about what we already do in this town when we put our mouths on the same moment. I told a story about a night when a brass band let a boy with grief in his elbows blow the air out of his lungs through their mouthpieces so his chest wouldn\u2019t crack. I talked about tea as infrastructure, and I made a case for quiet corners as emergency exits for souls and not for bodies, and I watched the chair of the meeting un-cross and re-cross her legs when she realized this could be a clause she could be proud of on her re-election brochure.\n\nBrill listened like a man taking notes in chalk on a wall that would wash in the rain. He flicked his gaze to the lens and back to me and put his hands together once, quietly, because he is not immune to an argument made well even if it is against what keeps his lights on. Hardeep\u2019s clause passed in the way most good things in a city pass: not because it was moving but because it was administratively easier than arguing for another hour in chairs built to break your resolve. We all applauded without standing; the town learned a new trick and we saved our knees.\n\nWe came out into a midday that looked like it could go either way. At the corner by the bakery the influencer inevitability had arrived. He had a ring light like a halo and sneakers that had never touched mud, and his mouth was so soft it could only be maintained by someone making apologies for it on rotation. He had bait for kittens\u2014flaky fish and the sound of the internet\u2014and he had a following like a school of fish that did not know the ocean from a tank. He had already coaxed four cats into sitting on his lap for the kind of love that gets counted. People had gathered because humans do when there is a lens and a promise that someone will be humiliated by the end.\n\nThe kittens smelled the trap and didn\u2019t mind, which is a cat\u2019s worst habit and sometimes mine. Kids squealed and adults arranged their faces into delight because the camera demanded they behave like hometowns on postcards. Then one of the cats tried to cross the street because love and attention are separate moods and the city is a mouth you can fall into in an instant. I set the bowl on the curb and the key against the lip and the chalk along the gutter, and I could feel the math of the road\u2019s cruelty starting to sum. Hardeep was there because he is there when you need a person with a vest and a plausible authority, and he stepped into the traffic with the posture of a yield sign. Mr. Li began to speak in the voice he uses for children who are behaving like floods, and somehow it reached everyone without being a shout. Layla made a human chain with three teenage boys who were bored until the work made them awake. The influencer kept filming like a man on a surfboard that has forgotten the ocean underneath.\n\nI pulled the copper loop out and let it lie on the asphalt like a coin under glass. It isn\u2019t magic exactly; it just suggests. It suggested to the cars that the corner was a loop and the drivers could not help seeing the space as round, not cutting it into parabolas with their urgency. The kittens came to the edge of that circle and sat because circles make sense to them. The children learned in a second what you teach over a summer in other places: how to stand with your knees soft, how to be a gate not a wall, how to send something small into safety without making it feel hunted. The influencer looked around for a villain and landed on me and did that thing with a jaw that says he has been told his anger is pretty. He said, into the stream, \u201cFairy tries to steal my content,\u201d which is the kind of sentence that makes me want to replace all words with porridge and let the town figure itself out without grammar for a year.\n\n\u201cYour content,\u201d I said, patient as kitchen tile. \u201cThese are citizens. This is not a zoo. This is a corner with cars and we would like it to stay a corner with cars and not blood. You can film from there if you also hold this,\u201d and I put a sign into his hands that Layla had conjured from thin air that read: ask before filming; ask before petting; ask before asking. He held it the way men hold their daughters\u2019 barrettes, like it would burn him, and then a double decker bus of embarrassment drove over his face at the exact speed it needed to, and he held it like a man told to carry his own groceries for once and discovering he had arms.\n\nA woman in a scrubs top and office shoes stepped forward and put the smallest kitten in the crook of her arm where, under a hundred cameras, it began to fall asleep because it had found a heartbeat it could trust, and I made a decision I had been avoiding: not to bend the man who had trapped them into softness myself. I had wanted to. I had wanted to take his chin and tilt it until he felt foolish without me forcing him. I did nothing. I put my palm flat against the influence and told it: matte, and it turned itself down a notch and kept moving and it was enough.\n\nLater, when we thought the danger was over, a boy with a backpack that had a logo that made me suspect he had money and not the training to handle it walked away with a carrier that looked like it had potatoes in it and had three cats instead. He had the look of someone who does not yet know the difference between collecting and saving. I had to follow him because small lives were inside his cardboard morals and it was not the town\u2019s job to teach him on the street. Down a side lane that smelled like onions and betrayal, I called his name without knowing it and he turned because shock breaks the anonymities we layer over ourselves.\n\n\u201cOpen it,\u201d I said, a softness that would dent anyone. \u201cPlease.\u201d He shook his head and the hair in his eyes made him younger than his arrogance would allow. \u201cI need the content,\u201d he said, and I thought of the day I had decided to make a habit of kindness and remembered that acquiring anything this way is a theft even if it makes you famous. I took the whisker key out and did something I had never tried in public in this register: I touched it to the idea of the latch. The box understood, which is to say it ceased to pretend to be stronger than my decision. The flap came up in his hands and the kittens looked at me with that expression that means I am here because you said hello and the world answered with light.\n\n\u201cKeep the box,\u201d I said, because you always have to give a boy something to walk away with. \u201cPut your headphones in it. Put an orange cat plush in it and learn to say no to the part of your brain that wants live things to make you feel more real. If you come to story night, I\u2019ll give you the microphone for five minutes and you can say the truest thing you have, and then you can hold a kitten like a human and there will be no cameras on and it will be better.\u201d He flushed and tried to make it look like anger and then like scorn and then like permission and finally he stumbled into grace. He left the box and its particular music of claws and cardboard on the ground and ran like a boy who has discovered his legs work.\n\nBrill escalated the way he does when spectacle fails: he got quiet. Phones began to vibrate at the same minute like birds coming out of a bush. The notifications were all in the exact same tone, that little adorable trill that tells you a friend has liked you into being for one more day. \u201clol?\u201d they said, in that punctuationless way that lets you put the guilt in if you want to, lets you put the venom in if you want to, lets you put your spare time into someone else\u2019s pocket without knowing what you have bought. People looked down at their hands as if their hands had betrayed them, and the air went tight and thin.\n\nLayla is a librarian and therefore a general, and she did not wait for my plan or for anyone\u2019s permission. She had stocked the desk with stickers for summer reading that said DO NOT DISTURB ME I AM BUSY BECOMING and she began to pass them out to anyone who walked by and any screen she could reach. The camera boy, whose face is an open door more days than it should be, went up to the second floor of the mall and unplugged the thing that was shiny and loud and told people he was doing a test, and the supervisors let him because they are human and bored. Hardeep sent round an email that said the city was running a quiet hour as part of its new Tea Clause awareness and if employees wanted to participate they could, and ten percent did and twenty percent pretended and thirty percent wished they had, and that is a start.\n\nI walked the thin places with the whisker key rattling like a coin in a prayer jar. At the router in the back hall I told the fans to hum like humble things. On the corner where the bus always arrives a little late I chalked a line and said on this side put your phone down. At the laundromat where the gossip spins faster than the machines, I put the copper loop on the counter and asked the woman whose kingdom this is to keep the volume of the world at neighbor and not at television. At the pond the fishermen sat and nodded like they had heard DMs hum in their pockets and had decided to be men whose attention could not be bought by dopamine in a sweater.\n\nBy evening, the town had succeeded at being less interesting than an appetite. Brill texted me a period. It was the most honest he has been all week. I sent back a comma, because I am rude and also because I am kind; the night needs a rest now and then.\n\nThe friend I had softened found me because tricks have a half-life and so do apologies. She had hair cut blunt and a jacket that says I have lived through weather. We went to the patch behind the band shell and sat on the short wall because chairs make speeches and stone makes confessions, and she told me with precision what I had taken from her the day I turned her into what she was not for the convenience of my conscience. She put her hands on her knees and kept her voice inside the legal limit and it still cut and I did not bandage it with jokes or with kittens or with the lie that I did not know what I had been doing when I did it. She said the word forgive without making a sentence out of it and I put my mouth around no, not yet, and she nodded because she does not owe me her smooth.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want when it happens again,\u201d I asked, because this is what I can learn and it is the only thing that will make me less of a hazard to the people I love. She looked at the bench where sleeps happen and anger also and said, \u201cAsk me first. Stand next to me, not in front. If you must, make me sharp, not soft. Remind me where to put the edge so that it cuts the cord I want cut and not my own fingers.\u201d I gave her the copper loop because there are things that handle lightning better than flesh, and she put it around her wrist like a decoration and a safety and we walked home as if we were friends and not a fairy and her error.\n\nA notice went up on the corkboard the next day with craft-knife precision and cheap staples that bite: KINDNESS PAGEANT: JUDGES ON SITE, PRIZES FOR SMALL ACTS, and my throat closed around the words until they tasted like irony. You cannot rate tenderness without making it into a weapon. You cannot rank kindness without teaching an audience to expect kindness like room service. He had scheduled it for the plaza by the skating rink where teenagers learn physics via bruises in winter and grandparents teach toddlers how to be pleased by small circles in summer. He had booked a pair of celebrities whose faces made people pay attention and whose souls I hoped were anywhere else. He had put out a call for nominations, which is to say he asked people to tattle on their own goodness and on other people\u2019s debts.\n\nI saw what he wanted: he wanted to make us tired of ourselves. We had been practicing the art of being decent in public for days, and it is exhausting if you don\u2019t feed it right. He wanted to turn our habit into theatre and our theatre into content and our content into a reason to be cruel again because we were sick of our halo. I do not have enough power to cancel a spectacle. I have enough to reroute one so that when the current arrives it is ready to do something other than shock.\n\nI made the hardest choice I have had to make since I walked out onto the lake and played chicken with the habits of water. I decided to withhold. I told the aunties and uncles and the cats and, worse, myself: for three days there will be no kittening at all, not even the small acts that make a teenager stop from pushing someone into a fountain or a man stop from telling a joke that will ruin a woman\u2019s day. I said it as a vow into the bowl and the bowl was not pleased. It is like telling your spoon that you will not stir. It is like telling your lungs you will hold your breath while the town learns. It felt like cruelty and discipline and I hated myself for it and made soup so that my hands learned again that some labor is boring on purpose.\n\nThe first day people looked around for the trick and, not finding it, put their shoulders up and their eyebrows down; they bristled and did not bite. The second day was worse, because everyone had gotten used to the idea that softness would arrive when they were stupid and save their day for them like a coat someone else put over their shoulders in rain without asking. The third day the town remembered it had its own tools. Hardeep moved stanchions not to separate but to demonstrate correct distance, and people learned to mirror it without feeling corralled. Layla made a sign that said TAKE THE MICROPHONE BEFORE YOU REGRET NOT DOING SO and nine women used it in the first hour and each of them did not need me, which is the sentence that keeps me awake and lets me sleep. Mr. Li taught a child to dump an entire argument into a thermos and shake it and pour it out as tea and then decide whether to drink it; the metaphor did what metaphors do when they are fed and went home with that family to be used at a kitchen table until it became both joke and law.\n\nThe pageant tried to make kindness a costume and the town wore sensible shoes. Men with clipboards asked for nomination forms and were handed recipes and babysitting lists and the name of a locksmith who undercharges single mothers. The celebrity judges stood on a stage like saints at a parade and realized they were in a town that had learned not to treat them as altars. Brill saw it. He is vain and he is not stupid. He watched my quiet, and he watched how quickly the town learned that my quiet was not punishment but pedagogy, and it made him angry with the ferocity of a man who has discovered that someone else gets to be the season for a while. He took the microphone and made a joke about bureaucrats with tea kettles that should have landed like a clap and landed like a dropped spoon. He said, \u201cWhere is our fairy,\u201d and people did not look at me because I had chosen a place to stand in the exact center of the crowd and be uninteresting. He asked me quietly, almost kindly, in the space between a child reciting her best thing\u2014I returned my neighbor\u2019s Tupperware, I washed it first\u2014and a teenager telling us the worst thing\u2014when my friend lied about me I wanted to die and then I wanted her to\u2014and I shook my head with the mirror in my pocket so that the no could ring inside me and not bruise anyone.\n\nThe pageant ended with a brass band doing something complicated with a song that didn\u2019t deserve it, and with the celebrity judges putting their faces on the tea clause and making a small video about civic kindness that might, ironically and finally, do some good. People went home with an aftertaste of labor and not of performance. The kittens came back the day after my vow ended, which is to say they had stayed away without sulking, which is a grace I did not think I would ever be able to ask of anything. They came with a look like inspectors and rubbed against the ankles of men who had been brave without wanting to be and women who had been honest with strangers and children who had left their phones face down for an hour because the stickers told them it might make them into humans. I poured milk into the bowl with a relief that made my hands shake and then steady.\n\nThat night I dreamt that the city had grown fur inside its walls and purred when we did something that would have made a worse town hiss. I dreamt of Brill with a bowl and of him drinking and not choking and of him, for once, not performing his swallow. I woke to the sound of a municipal truck breathing outside and my landlord\u2019s cat trying to tell me that the water notice had become a filming notice again and that our block was about to be asked to perform being itself. The whisker key hummed in a key I had not heard before, a minor thing with teeth in it, and the burr on my sill had caught a spider that was more geometry than aggression and had built a net that would not catch anything except relief. I made coffee and put the bill back in my mouth and found it smaller again, like a coin you thumb when you need to remember that money exists but is not a god.\n\nBy lunch, the clip of me saying soup had become a meme and a local deli had put up a chalkboard that read TODAY\u2019S SOUP: BRAVE LAUGHTER, and then in smaller chalk under it: we\u2019re working on the recipe, please be patient. The used bookshop sign had finally laid down and let its pieces be letters on the sidewalk, and a kid knelt and turned them like puzzle tiles into YOU OAKS SEE US, and he laughed like he had invented something. The town had put its paws on the inside and learned to be gentle without my hands on its head, and I will be paying for that quiet for a while with attention and with showing up, and it is the best debt I have ever let climb onto my back and ride. In the evening I walked to the bridge that only teenagers call a bridge and I held the mirror up to my own mouth again and said yes, just once, quietly, to the part of me that wants to be adored without labor, and then I said no, out loud, to the man hiding under the shadow of the walkway with a camera who thought he would catch me being sentimental. He lowered it, and I lowered the mirror, and the night came down like weather that can be handled if you have a coat and a friend and a thermos, and lucky me, I had all three.",
