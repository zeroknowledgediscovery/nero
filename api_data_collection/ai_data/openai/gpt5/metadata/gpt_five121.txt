Oakland breathes differently at dawn. The cranes by the port bow their iron necks to the bay like long-legged birds peering in, and the water slicks itself with a quiet that isn’t quiet at all. Streetlights give up their posts and go to sleep. Fog thins into a soft spill you can push your face through. The first trains fling their bright shivers across the tracks, and the city’s hum opens one eyelid, then the other.

I live in that hum. I live under it and over it, between the slats and inside the gaps. People say “sprite” like it means small or mischief when what it means is being hived to the pulse of a place. It means you can press your ear against an alley and hear the wires singing a law older than everyone’s rent. It means the city picks you like a tooth picks a seed.

They say Oakland picked me right away. I was hardly taller than the handle of a coffee mug when I crawled into the warm gullet of the laundromat on 38th and Telegraph, feeling the round-bellied machines talk to themselves in heat and lint. I didn’t know I was Thimble yet. I had another name then, something that tasted like milk left out on the counter, and there was a hand in that name. A hand, and laughter, and a bell that would not stop ringing near my throat. I don’t like to think of that bell. In my dreams it’s another planet.

By the time I remembered how to lace myself to a heat vent and drink in electricity like a broth, I was Thimble. I was a sprite from this city, and the city seemed to look back at me and nod, like, sure. We’re stuck now, you and me. Don’t wriggle too much.

I’m good at magic. I know it sounds like bragging; it isn’t, it’s inventory. I’m small and fast, and my fingers know what they’re doing when the air goes strange. I can coax light out of the brownest evening and bend it so it falls exactly where it’s needed—onto a seed that wants to be a tree, onto a sleeping child’s shoulder because the dream turned cold, onto the slick fifth step behind the tattoo shop so nobody breaks their neck that night. I can fold shadow and sew it to doorways so bad people miscount and go on past. I can listen to copper pipes and ask them to quicken the water’s courage so it doesn’t die on the way up twelve stories of a building that’s already lonely enough.

Oakland respects that kind of magic, the in-close, in-hand sort. Oakland is a mouth and a throat and a drum, and you can’t do much with far-away spells here. They go loose; they hit something that doesn’t belong to you. My magic flourishes because I can keep it tight. I can hold it in my mouth before I let it out. I can taste it.

And yet there are days when the magic sputters in me, like it caught a hair. It rolls back and makes me sneeze. I lean into a sun patch under the window and blink myself alive with it, one eyelid, then the other; the warmth leaks into me like an apology. Maya calls this “basking,” but she says it to the air, not to me. She has short-gloss hair and a laugh that chases itself down the hall. Sometimes she drops a scrap of salmon on the counter and forgets it. I never forget.

“Thimble,” Juniper said the first time we met, “you going to sit there and boil yourself like tea or are you coming to listen?” She was standing on the window screen, a slip of green and brown perched on the wire like a thought. Her eyes were wide as drops of oil. She flicked a crumb of paint with her foot so that it fell and fell and didn’t land.

“I can do both,” I said. “Show-off that I am.”

“Oakland didn’t hire you for modesty.” She climbed down the frame and slipped through the tear in the screen, dropping onto the sill. “It’s Soot,” she said. “He’s breathing bad again.”

You say Soot like you say night, or flood, like a thing that takes shape by filling absence. He’s a sprite the way a sinkhole is a well; a trick from the old language that got loose. He used to belong to somebody’s thought of a chimney in winter, a soot-black blessing for warmth. Then the chimneys went into history books and the blessing soured. He found diesel and asphalt and the belly of the freeway and learned how to love disassembly. He learned how to press down on a binding note until it cried.

Rumor says Soot wants to bring the planet down—not the city, not the continent, the planet—like it’s an old cupboard that creaks too much in the night. He wants to lay it out flat as a road and walk across it, quiet under his feet.

“Where?” I asked. My mouth felt full of iron. The warmth under the window turned into an argument between my skin and my bones.

“Down by the port.” Juniper’s voice went small, the way voices do when they’re remembering a big noise. “He’s making the water hold its breath until it faints.”

“You saw?” I asked.

“I heard. The terns were tearing at the air, they were so angry. One of them said they’d bite his throat, but then she laughed, because does he even have a throat. All that smoke.”

“Tell the terns to mind their nests,” I said. “We’re the ones with hands.”

Juniper made a face. “You’re the one with hands. I have leaf-ends.”

Her leaf-ends could needle a rat into reconsidering its evening plans, but I let her say it. There are hierarchies even in love; there’s pride even when you agree it doesn’t keep you fed.

“Fine,” I said. “We’ll go look. But if it’s a rumor—”

She grinned with too many teeth. “You can owe me a sardine.”

“I don’t eat—” I stopped. I was making a face with my whole head and could feel it. “We’re not talking about fish. We’re talking about Soot.”

“Fish later,” she said, and she was out the tear and into the screen before I could move. She scrabbled up and was gone into the gutters, a green-brown stitch in the city’s hem.

I dropped from the sill to the blue rug below with a little thmp I hoped Maya wouldn’t hear. The rug slurred my steps into the floor so I came out light on the hallway and ran. Ran the way you run when the spell to make you quiet makes you feel too heavy for your own bones. The front door was half open and hot wind pressed its mouth to it and said walk on out. I did. The smell of late morning asphalt hit me like an old poem I couldn’t stop reciting.

Down the concrete steps, through the patch of yard where the rosemary bushes keep secrets, past the chain-link that tries to pull your sweater into a longer sweater, and into the street. The light was the color of pennies. Somebody’s garden had exploded into flowers that looked like paper cranes and somebody else had decided their car would live on the curb forever. I touched the hood of it and hummed until it stopped remembering anger.

A bus went by with a red eye on its front, looking both ashamed and bustling, and graffiti wrote itself on a wall while we watched. Juniper earned her name by clinging to a fence post with her toes and swaying.

“You’re late,” she said.

“You’re a rumor-monger,” I replied, but gently, because her mouth had that chip in it like she was ready to break.

We took 36th down toward the port, tying ourselves tight around corners. People don’t see us if we don’t want them to; that’s one of the perks of being more real than they have time for. I see them, though. I see a man sitting on a stoop with his face in his hands so hard his knuckles are telling secrets. I see a child convincing a patch of dirt to pretend it’s the moon. I see the girl on the bike with the rip in her jeans over her knee and the hard knots of her hair bouncing, bouncing like faithful meteors. I want to stop, sometimes, and say something that sounds like “you are the spell,” but sprites don’t get to talk to people unless the city does it for us. It’s a rule. And rules, it turns out, are stitched into my mouth. Even when my stubbornness climbs the curtains.

By the time we reach the port, the cranes are bowing again. The water is a skin; it tightens. Boats muscle their way across it like men through a crowd, pretending not to see how the crowd moves to let them pass. The ferry is late. The gulls swear. My whole face prickles.

Juniper tugs at me, tugs again. “Listen,” she says.

I do. The sound is under the sound. There’s a hush in the bay that feels like someone put their hand over its mouth; there’s a weight. The water is forgetting how to speak. I feel the old bindings of this place—salt to shore, rust to breath, crane to cargo—beginning to test themselves, to push back and wonder what happens if they slack.

“Where?” I ask again, but then I smell it. Soot smells like what it smells like when you push your hand into the exhaust cloud of a truck and don’t pull away fast enough. He smells like pennies dropped into an old pan. He smells like someone worrying too hard at a thread, pulling and pulling without looking up to see they’re unmaking the whole sweater.

“Children of everything that breathes,” Soot says. He says it from everywhere at once. It’s an old trick and not a good one if you want anyone to trust your sincerity. “It is too heavy. It is too loud. You know it. I can quiet it for you.”

“You don’t have hands,” I say. “What do you quiet with? Your mouth? Your voice?” It’s impolite to taunt something that might decide to swallow a harbor as a snack, but Juniper’s face has gone still and that makes me want to say rude things to keep the world moving.

“You’d be surprised what I have,” Soot says, and then he laughs, and the laugh is all gravel and wet paper. I can see him now, a smear in the bright air where no smear should be, dark and glistening at the edges like squashed berries. He’s big for a sprite, which means if a human were looking they’d think they saw something in their eye. He drifts forward with an insistence that reminds me of someone’s bad uncle demanding a hug.

“So,” I say, and I smooth my mouth into a friendly line. “What’s the plan today, Soot? Because if it’s ‘choke the bay for fun,’ I’m going to add you to my list and I’ve already got three things on there.”

“You have a list,” he says. “Of course you do. You want more lists. Lists are order. Order is a story you tell yourself until the walls learn it. I want quiet. Quiet is final. Peace. After peace, new music.”

“You can’t get new anything by ending the planet,” Juniper whispers.

“By bringing it down,” Soot corrects, and he stretches, he widens like smoke under a ceiling. “Down is not gone. Down is rest.”

“Down is flattening,” I say, “and people aren’t pancakes, my friend.” I’m aware as I say it that my hands have started moving. They’ve pulled light from the corners of my eyes, the slick little bits that stick to the lid, and they’re rolling it. My fingers are clever when I’m not watching. They braid a thin cord out of that light, twist shadow with it until it has some strength, and then lay it along the lip of the water. It’s the first stitch of a net. If I can net the hush, I can lift some of it and the water will gasp and remember its name for “curve.”

“Thimble,” Juniper says, a warning.

I keep speaking to Soot to keep his sound on me so he won’t hear the quiet knitting under his own quiet. “Remember chimneys?” I ask. “In winter? You kept warm in there. You belonged.”

“Belonged,” he says, and I feel it, I do, a little throb of something like grief. “Yes. The last time anyone treated me like a guest. Not an oil slick. Not a monster in a headline. I was black on hands and cheeks and nobody hated me for it.”

“You could come home,” I say before I can stop myself. “Not to chimneys. To—”

“To what?” He is suddenly sharp. “To your oven with a window? To your heat vents with their little white grins? You will not invite me to a neighbor if you can keep me at a distance. I know how to smell truth.”

“True,” I say, and my net grows. It is thin, and it is black with light, and it hums when I touch it. The gulls tangle their voices in it and sing by accident. For one second, the bay inhales. For one second, it sees itself as something other than a held breath.

Soot sniffs. He turns his smear a fraction, and I understand that I’m more interesting, or more irritating, than the water. He leans toward me without moving. “What are you doing?”

“Knitting,” I say. “You like sweaters. Remember? The one with the hole in the elbow?”

His laugh is almost, almost bubbles. “You are not funny.”

Now, I am not a muscled sprite. There are some who can hold a roof up until the fire truck makes the corner. There are some who can walk into a band practice that’s going wrong and put their finger on one string and make every heart know the right speed. My magic is small. It is stitches. It is the difference between a cup of water and a cup of water with a squeezed lemon’s worth of light in it. But right now stitches are what I have. I throw the net. It goes over the hush and tightens and, for a moment, for two, releases the bay from being strangled.

Juniper cries out, wild with it. The terns open like torn paper; the air floods with wings.

Soot draws back like someone salted him. “Bad little tailor,” he says.

“It’s a nickname,” I say. “People who love me use it.”

“People who love you never last,” he says, and this is not what I expect him to say. It knocks my thought sideways. He reaches—can you hear that? Reaches? Dust drifts toward me like a hand. It is a hand. It’s heavier than it looks. He presses it against my chest and all that black dishwater sound pours in.

I forget my name. Wait—no, not my name. I forget absolutely every song. All of them. The pipes, the wires, the rust binding everything to breath, the echo in the stairs, the drumbeat the city keeps under the floor for emergency dancing: gone. It’s like a curtain fell and the other side of the room is theater storage. I’m a box with nothing in it. The net slackens.

“Thimble!” Juniper screams.

“I—” I say, and the mouth I’m speaking with feels wrong, too big, but the word comes out like me, like Thimble. The world comes back as if someone banged on the radiator from underneath. Not all of it, but enough. The net shivers and holds. My chest hurts like I swallowed a stone.

And Soot is laughing again. “You are small,” he says. “I forget. You are so small. You think about thread. I think about earth. Come see me when you are tired of making doilies while everything cracks under you.”

He withdraws. Nothing in the way of him, then nothing where he was, as if he were the idea of a darkness that left the lamp on by mistake. The hush loosens. The water coughs. The cranes lift their heads. A boat horn asks a question and gets it wrong.

Juniper is on my shoulder somehow, lighter than a napkin but holding a lot of heat. “He touched you,” she says. “Don’t lie. He touched you. Are you—” She stops, sniffing, like a sparrow deciding whether to land. “Your smell.”

“It’s my smell,” I say. “It’s stretched out.”

She presses her face to my cheek and I know she is reading me like a map. She has always done that. We met by accident when the laundromat coughed a button onto the floor and it rolled to my foot and she thought my foot was a little mouse. I have always loved her for being wrong with such conviction.

“He won’t forgive your net,” she says. “He’ll come back with a scissor.”

“We’ll hide them,” I say. I try to grin; my mouth decides it wants teeth, sharp ones, too many—but that is a thought that doesn’t belong to me, not entirely. I swallow.

“You heard his voice,” Juniper says. “You heard him want to pull the planet flat.”

“I did,” I say. “He thinks it’s mercy. He thinks quiet feels like love, and it does if you never had love except when things shut up.”

We stay there until the white paint on everything looks whiter. We watch the gulls give up their war, the terns drop themselves like coins into the glimmer and pop back up silver. We watch a boy with a kite discover wind and then power. The bay catches its breath and gives it back in small pieces.

When we walk away, I feel watched. Not by Soot. By the city’s smaller eyes. The ones in windows and from underneath porch steps and from the holes in the chain-link where something wriggled and got larger and left a bigger hole. The rumor of a thing that could lay us down and take away our movement is a rumor that makes every door look like a question.

“You should go home,” Juniper says. “Drink water. Find some sun. Sleep. Let me sit on your chest until you feel like you again.” She is very serious when she is proposing ridiculous plans.

“I am me,” I say.

“You smell like you, pulled thin,” she says, and flits ahead, leading, because she will not let me out of her eyes.

We take a longer road back. We cut under BART and the train roars over our heads and the rust rains down in penny-colored exclamations. The graffiti under there is a scripture; I read it with my fingers just because it wants to be read. A big painted face with three eyes tells me to be brave. Another one tells me to get out of bed, which seems like conflicting advice, but that’s scripture for you: a chorus, not a solo.

At the corner where the taco stand sighs through its aluminum skin, we find Kettle. He’s a sprite of a different stripe—If I were a string, Kettle would be a drum. He came with the lakes, or stayed because he liked the company; he has a belly. His mouth is always ready to be a laugh. He is old enough to pretend not to be old. He has the easy way of the ones who can hold an entire block inside their skull and turn it while they think.

“What’s wrong with you?” he says, like we came to sell him a vacuum.

“Nothing,” I say too quickly.

“He saw Soot,” Juniper says. “He knitted a net out of shadow-light and made the water breathe. Soot put his hand on his chest.”

Kettle stops. The tacos on their little paper plates steam like hot prayer. He stares at my chest as if he could spy a handprint there, a big black smeared one. He thickens as he thinks. I can feel it, the weight of him pressing into the air.

“He can do that,” Kettle says, not a question. “He can push himself into you and wipe away the songs.”

“It came back,” I say. “Most of them. Enough. The net held.”

“Nothing holds forever,” he says. “That’s the planet’s lesson. It’s also its laugh.”

I want to say something clever and don’t. I go quiet. The taco man looks over his shoulder and goes on frying his frying. Cars talk to each other in small soprano voices. The sky makes a point of being blue and then gets bored with it and leans toward other colors.

“He’s never gotten this bold before,” Kettle says. “To press you. To touch. The last time he went that far was when he found the freeway, and your grandma was there for that, and she stomped him good.” He eyes me. “You got any of your grandma’s feet in you?”

“I do,” I say, and feel a twitch in my toes that remembers climbing curtains. It’s stupid. That absurd thought again—the one where the room changes size and the table becomes a forest and I am a streak with bones like tiny reeds. I bite the inside of my cheek. It tastes like metal.

“You smell strange,” Kettle says conversationally.

“I know!” Juniper says, exasperated, because now it’s a thing and she likes to be the one observing the things first.

“She’ll be bringing sardines,” Kettle says to her. “You get some if you watch him. Make sure he stays in one piece during the night.”

“I can watch myself,” I say. My voice goes higher than it wants to, and a car alarm down the block agrees.

“You can,” Kettle says politely, “watch yourself fall into holes you don’t recognize.”

“I don’t fall,” I say, and then, because that’s one of the house-rules that my mouth knows, “except asleep.”

Juniper lays a hand on the back of my neck. It’s cool, and it makes my eyes slide closed for a second. The press of her palm feels like a blessing in reverse. I lean into it without thinking and then catch myself. There are people everywhere. Somebody walking a dog that is frankly a horse lets it sniff the newsstand and it writes a review with its leg. The dog-lady winks at me. It’s an accident. Her eye is winking at the world. Still. I wink back. For luck.

“Home,” Kettle says, like he’s the boss of sidewalks.

“What about Soot?” I ask.

Kettle licks his thumb and turns an invisible page in the air. “Soot is a story that wants to be told by the one who loses. He wants to pick up the ending and make you walk to it in a straight line. I prefer alleys. Stairs. Rooftops. We will not go to his ending. We’ll build a better one. After you nap.”

“I’m not napping,” I say, even as my bones announce that I am made of naps. Nobody taught my bones to be stubborn. They took the elective on their own.

Juniper grins. “Let’s nap wrong. On the kitchen floor. On purpose.”

Maya is in the kitchen when we come in. The kitchen smells like orange peels and something that has become soup, good soup. Maya is tall, for a human, which means she is a moving wall with hair and a smile that creates summer. She does not see me, except she does, except she doesn’t, except she says, “Hey, Fig,” and tosses the shape of my whole body a glance that lands behind my ear.

A sound goes through me like the snapping of lines at a dock. Fig. It’s a small sweet short fat word. It rolls. It sticks to the roof of your mouth. It means something else, somewhere else. She walks past me and taps a spoon on a pot. The spoon, the pot, the smell—this is world. I swallow and find my throat again. Juniper looks at me. I pretend not to notice her looking.

The patch of sun under the window is a rectangle cut out of heaven and dropped here by accident. I step into it and dissolve. The light runs its fingers down my back. It drips into me and nests. My hands release themselves from fists I didn’t know they were making. I think of nets. I think of stitches. I think of Soot as a stain somebody will spend a decade scrubbing and never remove, but he will fade.

Juniper sits on my shoulder and then my back and then settles wherever it feels like I am most likely to break. She’s good at that. She hums, stupid little songs, scraps of tunes I’ve taught the garbage pickup on Friday mornings so that the noise becomes almost dancing, unless you hate dancing, in which case please ignore. There’s a sound in the hall of someone passing. There’s a sound of someone upstairs doing laundry and dropping change. A small red dot appears on the floor. It streaks. Stops. Streaks. Stops. Insulting, that red. It is every comet; it is every crisis. Something in me springs. My paws—my feet—my whole mind—No. No. Not now. Not for a dot. I can capture light that has forgotten itself and turn it into a net; I am not going to chase a dot.

The dot shivers. It runs up the wall and dissolves into the air with a click at the end. Maya laughs to herself, a little. “Where’d you go,” she says, not asking me.

Sirens call from the street in three voices. They pass. Kettle’s words sit up on my chest and stare at me with patience. Down is not gone. He wants to lay the planet down. I think of the planet like something I could put my hands under. It would be warm. It would be so big I would need a hundred of me, a thousand, and a net made of the fiber of everyone’s hair. I could feel its pulse through my hands if I could be that big. I am not big. I am the kind of thing that sleeps in a rectangle of sunlight for an hour and wakes up with crumbs stuck to my face.

Sleep finds me before I can find it. It doesn’t ask. It is rude. I let it be rude. I let it come into my mouth and turn down the sound. I dream the laundromat. I dream the circle dance of the machines, the whole place sweating clean and the floor buzzing with everyone’s pockets. I dream a bell on a ribbon and a girl’s hand lifting it and laughing like a door you open onto a party. I dream the sound of footfalls softer than anything, then fast, fast, so fast I can’t hold them down.

When I wake, the sun has slipped its rectangle and gone to frame the refrigerator. The floor smells like the day’s feet. Juniper is singing to herself in the sink, dipping her fingers in the water and pulling them out, yawning. She always yawns when she pretends not to be worried.

“No sardines,” she says without turning. “But there’s a can of tuna. I sniffed it. It likes you.”

“Everything likes me,” I say. “Except Soot.”

“Even Soot likes you,” she says, soft. “He likes to think of breaking you. It means you are solid. Not a rumor.”

“Good,” I say. “Rumors are fun, but I prefer floors.”

She drops down to sit with me on the tile. We look out the window. The maple out there has decided to become birds; it’s been practicing for weeks. The sky is leaning toward making oranges out of clouds. Maya is in and out of the room, doing person things. At one point she sits on the floor with us and ties her shoe and looks right at me with her head sideways and I feel her thinking, you are a person thing, too, in your way, little one. The shape of her kindness fits me exactly. I am ridiculous with gratitude and want to rub my entire body along the edge of the cabinet to scrape the feeling off.

“Tomorrow,” Juniper says.

“Tomorrow what?” I ask.

“We go to the drains,” she says. “We go listen. Soot has friends down there who don’t have bodies anymore. They tap against the pipes and make sense out of nonsense. It’s like math, but wet.”

“Drains,” I say, tasting the word with a half-smile. “Romantic.”

“Rot romantic,” she says, thrilled. “Everything rots. You just have to get the timing right.”

“I’ll make a list,” I say, because Kettle teased me for it and I am nothing if not someone who encourages teasing by being exactly what you say I am.

“You make lists,” she agrees. “I make notes on the walls with moss. Kettle makes speeches to lightning. Soot makes a bed out of cities and the planet is an apple he wants to turn into sauce. We all have hobbies.”

“You always want to make me hungry,” I accuse.

“Do I?” she asks, and winks, and scampers under the table to examine the dust baseboard, which is a civilization if you are small enough.

I stand. The rectangle of sun is now the size of a hand. I plant my feet in it so each foot gets warmed the exact right amount, heel to toe. I lift my arms and stretch in a way that puts my back into the shape of a question mark and then an answer. My spine talks; I tell it shh. I have a collar memory that catches on the edge of me again, the bell, the ribbon. Fig. Fig. My name is Thimble. This has always been true and goes on being true even when somebody says another sweetness and tosses it and it lands behind my ear like a coin.

The window watches the street. The street practices being a river. The red dot does not come back, but the desire to chase it sits in me like a small door I keep shutting. I could go outside and run until something gives me back my throat, until the smell of oil becomes a monster’s breath I can kill with a single short throw. I could, but Kettle will be somewhere with a cup of tea in his hand pretending he doesn’t care where I am. Juniper will be in a drain with her ear against iron and I will be listening with her even if I stay home.

I open my hands. They look like hands. They know stitches. They know the backs of people’s chairs, the underside of couches where secrets fall asleep, the worn spoon Maya’s grandmother used to stir madness into soup during hard winters. They know the shape of nets and the weight of water and the speed of red dots. They are hands.

The night comes a piece at a time. The cranes bend and bend and bend and then stop bending because you can only bow so long before you become a kind of furniture. The neighborhood pulls its trash cans like an army. The air turns onion-sweet. My eyes widen to meet it. My ears—ears like all the small things in the city are listening, not me, me—I listen.

“Hey,” Maya says as she steps over me. “Hey, Fig.” She pity-rubs the top of my head with the leveled-off part of her knuckles and the world opens like a box you keep the good thread in. Thread. Nets. He wants to lay us down. I want to tie us up to ourselves. Opposites are not enemies. They’re friends who haven’t had coffee yet.

I slide into the night because it thinks I belong to it. Maybe I do. The street is a sheet being tucked under a bed. Somewhere in the pipes, someone knocks three times and then pauses and then knocks again: code. Juniper goes silent in the sink and vanishes; the window breathes in. Above us, the sky sifts itself into salt. The cranes hold still despite wanting to dance. The bay dreams of being a hand instead of a mirror.

I walk the fence. The fence walks me. The city hums with its old laugh and its newer ones, and the spell on my tongue is a small taste of metal that I swallow and know I’ll use tomorrow. I am Thimble of Oakland, good with magic, good with stitches, and the night knows my name, both of my names, all of my names, even the ones I have not said out loud, and forgives me for keeping them nested like spoons. The planet turns—doesn’t lay down despite a voice that tells it to—and I breathe with it once, long and shaky, and then again, steady.Night is a braid and I know which strands to pull. The first is damp and metallic; it loops around my throat with the smell of pennies and decides to be mercy. The second is humming with train-song, a blade of sound that separates one thought from the next. The third is soft as bread and belongs to every kitchen window that fogs when soup boils. I tuck them into my pocket and step out of my rectangle of floor like it ever belonged to me. The code in the pipes knocks again—three, pause, three, pause, five quickly, then the long hollow after-sound that means come if you’re small and not made of paper. Juniper turns her face toward the sink as if the bowl of it might tell us the time; water holds clocks if you make it. Somewhere under the block, beneath the thin blacktop and its dreamy oil stain constellations, the drains are talking math.

We go down the stairs quiet, and by quiet I mean the kind where your kidneys know you’re sneaking out and decide to help. The air at the door tastes like someone else’s sweat and the last of the day’s oranges shared between two mouths that didn’t want to kiss but did. The rosemary brushes my shoulder and tells me someone passed earlier who could not stop their hands; the secret of it flares and goes out, a small green bruise. Juniper hangs herself like an ornament from a chain-link hole, then slips through; I take the regular route and make it look like I meant to be seen if anyone’s looking. The street is practicing being a field again; now and then it forgets and twitches like a road. Overhead the BART slides by with its polite scream, pillbox windows full of tired eyes, shoes, ideas that will get written when the dishes are done. The rust that falls is sharp in my nose. I let a little of it stick to my tongue; I’ll need the red of it where we’re going.

The nearest mouth is a storm drain on the corner with the mango-orange stenciled fish that says you, yes you, don’t put your bad thoughts here, they go to the bay. The grate is striped with old leaves and the blonde hair of a doll who has learned about eternity earlier than most. Juniper crouches and makes a set of teeth at it for fun. The knocks climb the ladder of sound and find us. They are more deliberate now, insistent little fists on iron. Three, pause, three, pause, five. Then two, then two, then one, then a long scrape that pulls a shiver out of dirt.

He teaches them, Juniper says without saying it, and I nod without nodding and slide my fingers through the grate. The air below is cool with old rain and the breath of worms. It is also crowded with voices that never learned language because they never required it; drip, trickle, clatter, a single long cough from a pipe that hasn’t been asked to try since last spring. I thread myself down until my shoulders are in shadow and my hips remember that once I thought I would be the size of whatever cup someone handed me. Juniper follows by way of wall, walking herself along the rough concrete with leaf-ends that are also claws when she wants them to be. She stops a breath above the trickle, eyes huge, and listens.

Soot’s friends don’t have bodies in the way we mean when we say body. They’re residues, the tired blessings of solvents, the ghosts of bleach and the last prayers of soap left in a bucket after a flood. They find each other because loneliness taught them math, and the math they learned is banging. Tap says two. Tap tap says I miss a window. Tap tap tap the cadence of a siren holding its breath. Tap pause tap tap tap is a word they made up for the angle a winter morning makes when it lays its light across a curb. They are not precise unless you tell them they are, so I tell them with my breath, I say yes, show me where it hurts.

The knocks answer by moving to my left, into the old line that runs toward the lake. The lake is an eye; the drains are its lashes; the estuary blinks and everything near it becomes a new fact. I know what the code wants to be when it grows up. Juniper puts her ear against the wall and gives me the numbers back so they make sense to a brain that likes lists: four, two, second slack, gates asleep, teeth turned inward, pressure. Her voice gets thinner as she speaks, not from fear but from attention; she is following the knock like a scent, falling into its hips, letting it tell her how to put her weight down.

Second slack means the tide will hesitate and then hesitate again. The lake breathes through a throat made of gates down on 12th, old iron that learned to take orders when a different kind of city told it what to do. At slack, you can speak to water and it doesn’t argue; it thinks it’s a mirror. If Soot gets his hand over the mouth just then, the lake will forget how to exhale. The fish will let the thought of air sit in their skulls until it hardens like a coin. The birds will change their nests to math, add the eggs and subtract the parents. The necklace of lights will be brighter for a minute and then dim all together because some human who doesn’t believe in sprites will feel the need to ration a different kind of shine.

We move without moving. That is to say our feet do the small work while our minds write the letters we’ll need to send later. The pipe taste in my mouth shifts toward algae; it means we’re getting close to a place where people throw their wishes and forget that wishes rot too. I blow the rust I saved onto the belly of the nearest culvert and it sticks in a star. Condensation climbs up to see what I’m doing and drapes itself into a map. It’s crude, but crude maps get you to places fancy ones can’t see. The trickle lines hum with my breath and then with the breath of everything down here that isn’t solid. Four, two, slack, inward teeth, sleep. The note at the end is a flourish that makes my skin crawl. Quiet lays down after that, the knocks say, and doesn’t get up when called. There is a whisper of fans—too high up for drains to know about intimately, but we all share pipes when the city is tired—and they falter in the phrase that hospitals love best, the steady one that says I am here I am here I am here.

Juniper looks at me and her face is two parts triumph to one part fury. The triumph is because she was right about the rumors. The fury is because there is a baby’s foot on the edge of that thought about hospitals and she hates babies for making her feel like a leaf in wind. I take her hand without thinking and her fingers close around mine so hard my knuckles squeal. We both let go as if burned, shamed by our own people-ness for a second, then I stick two knuckles between my teeth and bite the ache down until it says friend instead of hunger.

We come up at the 14th Street manhole because it likes me. There are lips of oil around its edge the color of abalone and I lick one without shame. Aboveground has decided to light itself in sodium orange and violet, tastes that don’t go together unless you’re hungry enough. We cross toward the lake like we have permission. The Necklace of Lights nods around the water’s waist, a grandmother’s jewelry, a wedding for no reason other than someone wants it. Joggers perform their spells of repetition. A boy leans over the railing and pretends he is the world’s last questioner. At the west end, the tide gates hunker, their backs humped, their heads under. Kettle has rubbed his laugh on the concrete here a hundred times; it holds the sound, slick and bright, for when the morning needs to remember how to begin with something that isn’t an alarm.

The keeper of this throat is older than my grandmother’s footbones and twice as sarcastic. He is iron on the outside and wet string on the inside and goes by whichever of those feels more likely to get him a seat at a table with soup. When he is in a mood, he calls himself Gate; when he is in a better mood, he calls himself Mr. Jones as if the city would be fooled into thinking he is a single human with a hat that leaks rain. Tonight he is invisible until I lean my ear against the number stamped into the plate at the corner and say please like I was raised right. He rises as a sigh in my bones, a low creak that each vertebrae understands.

You’ve brought damp gossip to my door, he says, and the teeth of the gate grin without opening. You’ll get my floor all muddy.

Your floor is water, I say, and rub the plate until the 1 becomes an 8 and then becomes a 1 again, a small game we play to remind each other that numbers love to be easy sometimes. Soot has a crush on your throat. He’s going to kiss it until you forget how to swallow.

Gate would spit if spitting worked for someone made of hinge. He keeps his tone flat; he has seen too many children become wind myths, too many plans become plaques. Thought he was done with me, he says, after the last time he tried to make my back lie down. I got a new spine out of that and a better view. He rattles his bolts in the way of an older man shaking his paper before he folds it. Second slack, he adds, as if telling me he noticed before the drains noticed and we both know that’s not true. Soot’s got better timing than any clock you can afford. You going to knit me one of your nets, Thimble? Net me a throat?

If you let me touch what’s behind you, I say, and this is a big thing to ask. There are songs behind Gate that even I only know by their polygons. There are laws back there that don’t show their faces unless you feed them fresh secrets. I have one secret in my pocket that is still warm; his hand on my chest. I hand it to Gate. He tastes it and his teeth hurt with the old grief Soot keeps for himself; Gate is not sentimental, but he mutters a blessing in a language older than either of us, older than shore.

You’ll stitch, he says. You’ll make me a false slack so the water believes in a different inhale. He’s going to press on my tongue when I say ah. So we’ll say oh instead, and he’ll step on where I used to be. He’ll slip. He’ll swear. The terns will laugh as usual and get in the way.

We do that. We make a smaller tide behind the tide. It sounds glamorous, but really what it means is I press my fingers against stone that has been listening for longer than most gods and persuade it to see curves in the quiet. Juniper lays moss into the cracks like someone laying hair into a lover’s fist. Gate exhales until the water blushes the way somebody does when they’re told a good joke too late and laugh anyway. It will hold for one slack, maybe two. It is a cheat. But cheats are useful when the person trying to keep you in a permanent pause is calling his mischief mercy.

A gang of rats appears on the far side of the weir like an election. Their leader is a color that used to be called mouse, which is fun for everyone except mice. He bows with his entire back and smiles with his whiskers because he would like to be a king even on nights when he is only a prince. Marrow, Juniper says in the tone she reserves for empires, and he puffs.

We heard tapping, Marrow says, and his voice makes a tiny grater out of the air. We brought strings. They’re dry. Dry strings do math better. He drops a wad of line at my feet, bright red from somebody’s hoodie, sticky with spilled soda. His boys and girls plant their paws on it and hum to make the fibers remember being tree. I take the line and feed it into the stone where my net wants to be; that little slap when it meets water is a promise. I pat Marrow’s shoulder with a finger as big as his head. He beans up with pride; the smallest ones whisper about cats as if talking about ghosts. I sneeze and they scream with joy. I could chase you until you forgot your names, I don’t say. I could eat you and have room for cake. Instead I make my mouth into a room where nothing bad happens and let them stand in it awhile.

You are your grandmother’s foot, Marrow says without knowing he’s said anything at all. It is something his bones remember from the day the boulevard lay down and crushed small worlds and the sky learned how to take the weight. I put my palm to the concrete and feel the old bruise. I tell it I remember. I tell it I hate history sometimes. It taps back: me too.

We don’t get to say a plan out loud because the plan would become a pillar and Soot loves to mark pillars with greasy kisses. We write it into the wind by not closing our mouths on certain letters, by letting the steam from the lake carry pieces of it into the jacaranda trees two streets away where a girl is braiding her hair into demonstrations. It goes like this: when the moon pulls, we’ll pull back; while he puts his hand on the mouth, we’ll open a new mouth under his hand; while he looks for the quiet, we’ll give him a song in a scale he forgot he ever liked. If he tries for hospital fans, we’ll move the breath around the corners of the buildings the way we do in summer when we can’t stand ourselves. Kettle will knock on lightning and pretend he was aiming for thunder and get both. Juniper will become an idea that ants argue about until they fall asleep full of punctuation. There is no part after that because the after is always a different animal than we imagined.

The lake hiccups and a streak of silver against the dark flings itself against the barrier. Juniper curses in the language of leaves, which sounds sweet but isn’t, and is over the railing, leaf-ends in the water, vertical on the stone like gravity is a rumor. The fish are small and a lot—the anchovies are practicing being a mirror again and forgot about the air. Soot is down there like someone put a lid on the pot for a second to teach everyone a lesson. I kneel and breathe the light off my fingers until it becomes a shawl. You wear it, I tell the water, not to hide but to give yourself a second skin. The shawl sinks and flares just enough to fold into the pockets in the current that are safest. The anchovies find the safety by accident or genius; I never ask which. A dozen don’t and slide their bodies out of life. Juniper makes a noise that belongs to inside a tree.

He wants you to get sentimental, Gate says dryly. You get sloppy when you get human. You forget the math.

Then don’t let me, I snap, more viciously than I mean to, because the thought of the hospital fans makes my teeth drag lines in my own mouth. Gate grinds his hinge in agreement and the grind is a taste like old pepper; it sharpens me. Soot doesn’t speak. That is the most insulting thing he can do. The hush thickens and then thins; he’s testing how much of his handprint I’m still wearing, and I hate how it makes my chest twitch, a misremembered cough.

We work the rest of the night in small ways. If you saw us you would think we were doing nothing—a girl and a not-quite and a line of rats and the illusion of a manhole cover talking to itself. But we turn screws that other people don’t know are there. We put our mouths on the steam that breathes out of the maintenance room and teach it to carry songs uphill. We roll pennies along the railing until they hum just enough to make a vibration the size of a kindness in a nurse’s hand. We whisper to the turtles and ask them to be late in the morning on purpose. We hide what scissors we can scent. The scissor he will bring will be more like absence than steel, but even absence needs to be kept sharpened, and we can blunt edges when no one is looking.

Somewhere past midnight, the bus that runs along Grand decides to talk to me. They do that, on their own timetables. Her face is a sigh someone put paint on. She says I had a boy who fell asleep with his head against my window and dreamed oranges and I did not take that personally, and I tell her that makes her better than gods and she snorts exhaust with pleasure. Have you seen Soot, she asks, pretending she hasn’t seen him smeared across every hill in town on days when the wind is a liar. He has new jokes, I say. He wants to teach you to run without stopping. She shudders her shocks. That’s not running, she says. That’s wanting to be a rumor so badly you forget you have seats.

By the time second slack limps toward us the sky has chosen to be the color of the inside of a shell. The air smells like milk that decided to forgive you. We gather ourselves. Gate takes his place at his own throat with theatrical grace. Juniper shakes out her shoulders like a boxer. Marrow sends a scout and then decides to be brave with his entire body. I stand on the narrow ledge between two jobs and make my hands into what my grandmother’s feet used to be. The tide hovers. The necklace tightens. Across the water a woman carries two cups of coffee like they are the collected opinions of her family.

He comes like a quiet thought a city would be embarrassed to admit to. No fanfare. No lecture. The hush goes first, the pressure next, his presence last, like someone who hates a party showing up at the end to say he was there. The handprint in my chest warms, an old black tea in a chipped cup. He rests his palm on the lake’s mouth exactly when we thought he would, and the world fails to exhale on cue. We pull.

Juniper’s moss stitches yarn into the stone with the ferocity of a love letter that couldn’t be written politely. My rust map thrums; the red hoodie string glows in some secret part of itself where it didn’t know it was alive. Gate opens the place that isn’t a place and lets the smaller tide breathe in and out with the conviction of a liar who has decided to reform for the afternoon. Soot pushes into our false slack and finds only the shape of what he wanted to stop. For a second—two, if I am counting dishonestly—he is confused. Confusion is a sound I like. It sounds like someone finding a stair where there should be air.

He recovers faster than you’d think for a smear. He finds the seam in our seam and tugs. Juniper yelps; the moss wants to be a daylit thing and the night is asking too much. Marrow loses his nerve and then finds a worse one and barrels forward. I let go of the way I was holding the light and hold it flatter, like wrapping a gift you’re not sure anyone will want. The anchovies turn their faces toward something green that isn’t there. The gates do exactly what they’re supposed to and then something I didn’t tell them to; Gate winks at me through his hinge and I decide to be smug later.

He touches me again, not with the hand but with the shadow of the hand. It moves over my mouth like a person wiping a loved one’s lip. My songs go on vacation. I gasp and I hate that it’s a human sound. The pipes I keep in my pocket flush with embarrassment. There is nothing in me for a heartbeat but the desire to lean against a door and pretend the hallway outside does not exist. Juniper puts her teeth into the wrist of my mind and shakes. My name bangs into place like a trash can lid kicked in delight. I swallow the quiet like it’s a coin and make it stay.

We don’t win. We don’t lose. We choose the third door and it’s a stairwell. The tide slides past the moment Soot wanted. The lake remembers how to exhale at the wrong time and doesn’t mind. The hospital fans flicker as if someone remembered three birthdays at once and couldn’t decide what song to sing, then settle into the old refrain. The anchovies make a new conspiracy involving shadows and forget what they were fighting about. Soot lifts his hand and I feel the absence of it like you feel the weight of a basket you put down and then miss. He doesn’t say anything. That is a gift and a warning.

After, the city does the thing it does where it claps with all its windows. The quiet rolls back down the hill and sits under someone’s porch like a possum. We breathe like we invented it. Gate makes a noise like somebody fixing their belt after the best meal of their life. Juniper leans against my hip and pretends she’s checking her leaf-ends for nicks. Marrow does a little dance he claims is religion and I don’t argue. The lights wink around the water like pearls remembering their oysters.

Kettle finds us after dawn has already argued its case. He lumbers along the path with a cup that smells like somebody put smoke into tea and got forgiven for it. He takes in the stitches, the rust, the rat line drying in the weak sun like a banner, the way I am standing as if nothing in me was knocked crooked. He tips his cup toward the gates and Gate rattles something like hello in a baritone only fools would ignore.

You shouldn’t have been able to do that, Kettle says, and it’s not reproach. It is wonder with its hands in its pockets. Not without losing a piece you need.

I lost it, I say, and got it back wrong, which is a kind of right. He tilted me. The word tastes like a coin as well, old and mouth-warmed. Kettle peers with the part of him that isn’t eyes.

You’re holding your name with your teeth, he says mildly. Might want to put it somewhere safer before you sneeze. He sips and the steam makes shapes that are copies of his shoulders.

I decide to be brave about being an animal and yawn. Juniper laughs until she nearly falls into the lake; two ducks criticize her manners and then argue with the water about it. Marrow gathers his people with a noise that would embarrass most emperors and trots off. Gate mutters to himself and changes his number for the afternoon in case anyone is counting. The day warms in the way of a city that knows better than to trust its own gentleness.

We should sleep, Juniper says into my shirt, which is the piece of air where my shirt would be if I cared about shirts. No kitchen floor this time. Your back will forget who it is. Bed. She says bed like a thunderclap. She is all ferocity and furrowed brow, and I love her and do not tell her because saying it would turn it into a stone and she prefers to be a pond.

On the way home we run into a ghost. Not of a person—Oakland keeps those mostly to itself—but of a sound. Seventh Street used to be horns and a woman near the tracks who sang like someone telling all the secrets after church. The sound is leaning against a wall where the blues were left under paint and it doesn’t recognize us at first. When it does, it lifts the hem of itself and shows us the snap in the elastic. Soot liked to come here, it says in a voice like a reed sitting in a cup too long, back when he still tried to seduce. He learned that some rooms are already quiet and he is not necessary. He hated that. Maybe that’s why he likes the hospital fans so much. I nod, and Juniper presses her ear to the brick and hums until the ghost thinks it is being held.

Maya is home when we get back, which is like saying the sun remembered which side of the building it likes best. She is at the table with a pen and her ear in her palm. The pen is taking itself too seriously. The sheet of paper under it has a bruise where a word wouldn’t behave. She looks up when the door does the thing it does and says hey Fig without looking at me directly, which is politeness when you care about a thing that won’t admit it’s a thing. My whole skin lifts under her voice like grass. Juniper hides in plain sight by becoming a shadow of a plant we don’t own.

Sleep is a trap and I walk into it with my eyes open. The bed is a raft. The raft remembers rivers even when you’re not lying on it. My hands find places to be hands in the tangle. The bell remembers me and I pretend not to hear it. In the hallway someone drops a spoon and it becomes a story about a woman with three phones. The red dot does not appear, and I think, brave, and then dream that I am inside a lamp and someone is telling me not to be so literal about light.

When I wake, it’s because there is a mouth in the room that wasn’t there earlier. It’s made of smell. It is Soot’s version of polite: he has sent a moth. It is fine ash glued together by suggestion, a gray-black whisper with wings that are not wings but ideas of leaving. It lands near my eye where the skin is thin and tries to breathe me. I don’t flinch. I don’t swat. I close my hand around it and let it decide if it wants to live in my palm or die between my fingers and it decides neither; it decides to become a line. The line climbs my arm and lays down a highway on my skin, a rule, a road he would like me to take. Juniper wakes without waking and bites the air near my wrist, not touching, a warning to the line that anything could happen. The line pauses. I blow on it with a breath I borrow from the bathroom sink and the line curls into a question mark and slides off my elbow and disappears into the floorboard crack where secrets go when they want to make friends.

You saw that, I say.

I saw that, she says, and her voice is pride nailed to fear. He thinks you collect him in little pieces, she adds, jealous but not of Soot, jealous of the part of me that can hold a moth made of an invitation and not fall in love with it.

He thinks the planet is a bed, I say, and he wants to make it. He wants to smooth it flat and take a nap on it until we all learn his sleep. We’ll keep the springs loud. She climbs onto my shoulder and steps along the ledge of my collarbone like it is a place to be brave.

We eat as if food were proof. Tuna that smelled like it liked me becomes something that knows my mouth. A piece of toast says the kind of things bread says when it has been forgiven for having a past life as a field. Maya drops a slice of salmon by accident, and it’s not an accident, and I don’t pounce. I stroll. Dignity is a religion. When I take it, she laughs in that way that makes summer slam into the room and lean against the fridge and fan itself. Fig, she says, and the word licks the place behind my ear and sits down.

After the coffee that isn’t for me, after the water that is, after the note Maya writes herself and leaves on the counter because she forgets her thoughts do not live in her pockets, we go back to the drains. The afternoon is a different animal than the night; it likes to perform. Kids argue with their scooters. A woman plants basil like it’s a plan for the city. A hawk rides the warm air and decides not to eat the pigeon because the pigeon believes today is rehearsal. The drains are hotter, more metallic, proud of their shadows. The tapping has changed. It is giddy with having survived. There is a new number in it, a seven that wasn’t there before. It tastes like glass. It comes from the direction of the Webster Tube, that concrete tunnel where whole days of breath move under the water and come out smelling like stories people tell at Thanksgiving about how they knew a man who built a bridge with a spoon.

He’s in the tubes, Juniper says, and I say Of course, because if you liked pressing things flat you would fall in love with the idea of a road that goes underwater and comes back up believing nothing happened. The tubes are a whole philosophy of down pretending it is sideways. Soot will drag his hand along the ceiling and see how many breaths he can collect before someone remembers to widen their mouth. The fans there are old, too old to brag; they are the kind of machine that knows it’s a prayer.

We look at each other and love the problem for being itself. I take the rust into my mouth and roll it like candy until the taste becomes a map I can carry behind my teeth. Juniper sharpens her leaf-ends against the curb and tells the curb she’ll bring it a joke later if it lets her use its face as a whetstone. We head toward the tubes with our pockets full of promises and our backs full of the knowledge that we are not alone and that we are not numerous either, which is a comfortable ratio when you have good knees.

On 7th we pass a woman selling cold mangos out of a cooler and she flicks her knife like a tongue and says to me without looking, Don’t let him make your face a floor. I tell her I wasn’t planning to and she clicks her tongue as if that’s what everybody says before they lie down. A man behind her plays with a deck of cards that has been to too many laundromats. One card falls. It is the King of Cups, which is funny if you like jokes about water. I pick it up with my breath and put it back on his shoe. He looks down and can’t explain it to himself, which is the best kind of magic to give away free.

The entrance yawns and the present tilts. The air chooses a side and it’s the side made of old chewing gum and the stories of small boys daring each other to walk all the way through without touching the wall. There is a sign that says no pedestrians and beneath it another that says also no dogs, you maniacs, and beneath that one someone has written unless the dog knows what he’s doing, and beneath that I add in the small scratch language we keep for ourselves We do. The fans are ahead, the big ones, the ones that remove the ghosts of tires and give them to the sky. They hum with a dignity that sits up straight in a chair. The hum stutters. Soot is inside the hum. He is pulling every fourth breath out to hold it up to the light and stare at it like a jewel and decide it would be prettier in a drawer.

We can’t knit across this. The space is wrong, horizontal and stubborn with the kind of authority that makes maps a lie. We cheat differently. I put my hand on the slick tile and ask it to give back the footprints it remembers. It wants to. It has collected footsteps like dolls for decades. They come up in a crowd: high heels trying to be horses, soft rubber soles that obeyed their parents, boots that tracked in the field on purpose because it was funny, paws that didn’t know what the sign said. I choose three that still have their heat: a girl’s who ran halfway and got called back by a voice that had eaten cigarettes; a man’s who carried a cake and a fear and didn’t drop either; a child’s who dragged one foot on purpose to hear the sound of it. I sew those footfalls together and make a path that doesn’t care about air. Juniper climbs my shoulder and takes a piece of the hum into her mouth and chews it like gum, then spits it out in a shape that looks like a ladder only if you are the type to trust ladders made of breath.

We move along the path like the old game where you don’t step on cracks because you respect your mother’s back too much to give it a hard day. The fans turn their faces toward us and hold, curious, the way a dinosaur would hold if it noticed a bug that happened to speak the right language. Soot shows himself because it costs him nothing to be brave. He is the absence of shine in the corner where the light should pool. He is the part of the photograph you think you remember wrong. He is thicker in here, more persuasive, a voice that has learned what a throat is for and wants to try it on.

This again, he says, and feigns boredom, which isn’t one of his strong suits.

Until you learn a new trick, I say. You’ll forgive me if I don’t let you practice on the day I live inside.

You could live inside any day, he says, and he isn’t wrong. That’s the trouble with places like this. They keep their doors open so long they forget how to lock them. That’s the trouble with you. You love doors.

I like hinges, I say, and Gate snorts from a mile away without meaning to. I touch the tile again and pull up another path, this one made of the memory of a baby stroller wheel that squeaked on C and the laugh that fixed it. I unroll it and lay it between Soot and the fan. He steps onto it out of curiosity and this is his flaw: he believes he can be everywhere so he forgets to be cautious anywhere. The path becomes sticky in that elegant way physics knows how to be without bragging. He tries to lift his hand and finds his hand likes me less than it did a minute ago.

In the second that buys us, Juniper does something I would not have thought of. She does not attack. She does not sing. She claps. Once. Sharp. It is the sound your teacher makes when you are drawing on a desk and she likes the drawing but not the desk. The clap shivers the hum into remembering its own spine. The fan leans into its job. The air flows forward with purpose and a little glamour because it just realized it looks good doing it. Soot has to move or become part of the tile. He jerks, offended, leaking a darkness that looks like it might stain your hands and then doesn’t. That un-staining is worse than any mess.

He shakes off the path and looks at me, not with anger, but with something like the amusement of a creature who just watched a smaller creature pick up a big stick and wave it around without falling over. The touch on my chest tingles. You are sharper than before, he says. He says it like compliment and fact. Be careful. You will cut yourself.

I have hands, I say, and hold them up. They look like hands even here where the light is a rumor of a memory of salt. They have little scars that aren’t scars. They smell like rust and tuna and the rope from a red hoodie that is now sewn into a weir. He regards them the way you look at a photograph of a family you used to be married into. He lifts a shoulder that might be a hill full of grass or a pile of dealership receipts, then unlifts it. The fans continue. We both pretend we are not tired. He slides backward into the kind of breath that makes eyes water and is gone into what the tube thinks of as its own.

After, I put my forehead against the tile and tell it a joke. It’s not a good joke; it hasn’t slept. Something about a bus falling in love with a stairwell. The tile laughs because it is polite. Juniper leans into my neck and listens to the blood in it like it’s a sea. She taps a rhythm that is not math. It’s the beat you put under music when you want people to know when to lift their mouths to the cup.

On the way up, the red dot appears again because of course it does. The sun is throwing arrows through a piece of glass somewhere, and one of those arrows hits the floor in front of my feet and skitters. It is so rude, that dot. It is so certain of itself without having earned any of that certainty. My whole being collects itself and chooses. I let it streak. I let it stop. I let it be a little crisis that is not my crisis. Later, maybe, I will chase something for the joy of being faster than the day. Now I open the door with my whole body and the city licks my face with its morning breath and says, good. Good. Little one who is and isn’t. Good.

We are halfway back when the earth under us ticks. Not a quake. A practice. The hills yawn to remind themselves of the plot. Soot is humming somewhere, less triumphant now, more persistent. Kettle stands on the corner with a newspaper that is mostly the smell of old ideas and offers to read me a horoscope for a sign I don’t admit to. Today is not your day, he reads, squinting, then Today has decided to be your day if you pretend not to notice. He folds the paper. I take the words and tuck them into my mouth next to the rust and the taste of Juniper’s leaf-ends. I know what we learned. He likes throats. He likes fans. He likes places that pretend they’re not throats or fans. He will make new beds because the old ones have splinters. We will keep being inconvenient like gravel. We will keep sewing until the scissors are dull enough to use as spoons. We will chase the dot when the work is done and laugh at ourselves when we bump our noses on the wall.

Maya is on the floor later, cross-legged, eating the rest of the soup straight from the pot because bowls are a suggestion. She sees us by not seeing us and says, You two smell like rain and a parking garage, good for you, go drink some water, that’s my advice for everyone. Advice, I have found, is another kind of spell. I drink. It tastes like medals in a drawer and someone proud of me who isn’t on this side of the pipes anymore. Juniper washes her hands in the sink and shakes them all over everything. The drops write notes no one reads and the notes spell AVOID STRAIGHT LINES over and over until the letters learn to be the shape of a stair.

When the window takes on its evening face, I stand on the sill and look out at a city that gives up nothing and gives me everything. The cranes bow because they are polite. The birds forgive the day for doing what days do. The bay makes a secret and keeps it exactly long enough. My chest still has the outline of a hand on it and I play with the notion that if I drag my fingers across it at the right angle I will find a door. I might. I might not. Either way I am a small piece of a big thread, and the spool is spinning, and somewhere someone is wearing what we’re making and they look outrageous and perfectly themselves and no one dares tell them to sit down.Chapter 5

Oakland wakes different when it’s planning to be brave. The cranes don’t bow so much as set their shoulders; the water puts on a skin with a grip to it; the sidewalks look like they’ve been ironed. I can taste it in the way the rust sits up in my mouth and asks for a napkin. The drains have stopped bragging and are taking notes. Somewhere out of my line of sight, the city is tightening its laces with its teeth.

Kettle finds me with the smell of smoke that decided to be tea and not apology. He doesn’t bother with hello; he puts his hand where a human would put a hand if a human could put a hand on a question and says, “Edges,” like it’s a word we’ve been circling for days. “You hide scissors,” he adds, “by giving them too many places to be caught. You give the edge a home so it stops cutting to be noticed.”

“We were going to dull him,” I say, and my voice comes away from my face with a little black lint on it, the handprint still ghosting my ribs.

“Dulling is for spoons,” he says. “We’ll get there. First we tide him in corners.” He grins with half his mouth and makes a noise that sounds like a drawer closing over an inheritance. “Hair,” he says.

Juniper is upside down in the window listening to the basil announce weather with its tiny green tongues. She flips upright and hisses with delight. “Barbers,” she says, tasting the syllables like they’re sugar. “Barbers make laws out of hair.”

“International,” Kettle says, already walking. “Faithful Fade. The pole hums like a prayer wheel. Bring your pockets. Bring patience. They have both and neither.”

Faithful Fade announces itself with stripes that never stop arguing about which way is up. The pole’s red is a heartbeat; the white is a confession; the blue is a song that wants to be a siren and doesn’t get its wish. Inside, the air is talc, oil, and the museum of jokes men tell when they’re getting made into new versions of themselves. Clippers whine with the assurance of small machines that know they’re close to the crown. The mirrors multiply the room until it looks like a deck of cards laid end to end. On the floor, hair gathers in weather patterns: storm of tight curls under Chair Two, drift of silver near the sink, a brown river braided with a little boy’s bravery and his mother’s bargaining.

Clip runs the place with hands like declarations. His fingers are steel when they need to be, soft as rag when they don’t, and he cuts with a rhythm that would make a train jealous. He looks at me out of the corner of his eye the way barbers do when they know you’re a story. “You’re late,” he says, clipping a clean line behind an ear that has heard more sirens than sleep. “Soot’s been bringing folk in who want to forget the sound of themselves chewing.”

“I want hair,” I say, and then realize how that sounds in a room full of men who have waited their turn with generosity and gossip. “The fallen kind,” I add. “The remembered edges. The part that got cut off and learned how to hold history.”

Clip flicks the switch and the room lets the quiet in. He gestures with his jaw. “Sweep,” he says. “Bag by bag. Tie it with words. Take some grease too; it helps hair stick to thresholds. Don’t take the jokes; we need those.”

Juniper dives into the weather and starts sorting with a concentration that knots my breath. She knows which curls will hold a promise like a hook and which straight hairs will lay down like a line on a map. I hold the bags open and whisper the names the city gives its hair after it leaves heads: thread, river, shield, net, ghost of a brush. Clip keeps cutting but his hum bends toward us. When he speaks, he speaks to the pole, to the mirrors, to the line of men who are pretending not to listen. “Soot’s edge is absence,” he says. “He cuts with what isn’t. That means he needs a story to hold the shape of his blade. Hair is all story. It remembers heat. It remembers hands. It tangles when it’s bored. Tangle him.”

“What about when he brings the scissor?” I ask. The word sits wrong in my mouth and tries to open itself the way a wound does when it thinks it’s needed.

“He already did,” Clip says, and his mouth gets small with respect for things that cut. “You’re wearing the mark. Don’t be cute; we all can smell it. Hair is good for keeping the scissor occupied. For dulling, you need a ring.”

The pole hums high and then low, like a door chime in a language I used to know. The last time a bell touched me I was learning the geometry of a kitchen from the wrong end of a leash. The collar ribbon was red as the barber pole and the bell was a moon with a temper. I swallowed my name around that sound until milk curdled in it. Bells and I have an understanding now: I pretend they are for ships and schools and not for the soft skin of a throat. Clip doesn’t wait for me to answer. He tilts his chin toward downtown. “Tribune,” he says. “Those clocks have opinions. The bell owes Kettle three favors for lightning he didn’t claim.”

Kettle whistles like someone calling a dog he respects too much to whistle for. “Come on,” he says, and his eyes go out of focus for a second like he’s reading rain. “Bring the hair. Bring your fear of ringing. We’ll teach it to heel.”

The Tribune stands up straighter than it has to, like a foreman pretending to be a spire. The old press ghosts have laid newspapers over its bones and taught it to expect headlines even when the day is a whisper. The clocks turn their faces to the corners of the world like a woman showing four photographs of the same child because she can’t decide which smile is proof of the soul. We slip in through a door that is pretending to be locked for someone else. The lobby smells like old ink and the leather talk of chairs that went to press conferences without answers. The elevator knows my weight from other tricks; it grumbles and carries us up because it misses being taken seriously.

Page meets us halfway, a ghost made of commas and deadlines. He wears a tie that thinks it’s a sentence and a grin that has been cut with a linotype. His sleeves are rolled like courage, his eyes the color of photographs in rain. “Sprout,” he says to Juniper, then to me, “Scissors on your chest, stitches in your hands. You’re a headline I’d steal if I had a paper.”

“You have a paper,” Kettle says. “It’s called a sky.”

Page laughs the way an old newsroom laughed when coffee was a philosophy. He leads us up a stingy staircase to a door with a memory of being wood. Beyond it, the clockworks open like a jaw. Gears bite time and let it go. The room is a hymn to math with grease under its nails. The bell hangs in the air like a patient thunderstorm. It has a name it doesn’t share and a history it throws over its shoulder when it doesn’t want to talk about it. The last time it spoke out of turn, the windows on three blocks shook their glass loose from their frames and decided to be waterfalls.

“Hello, child of basements,” the bell says to Kettle, not in sound but in the way the metal makes your marrow lean. “You owe me a story. Or I owe you a ring. My ledger is a mess today.”

“You owe us three,” Kettle says cheerfully. “Take one off and then lend us one, with interest at the rate of not dying.”

The bell turns its attention to me with the lazy cruelty of large objects. “You look like someone’s hand has been telling you what silence is,” it says, and the tone of it is not unkind. “Do you bite bells?”

“I duck them,” I say. “I duck and I pretend I meant to look at the floor.”

“You’ll look at me,” the bell says, not unkindly; more like a mountain telling a stream that both of them know how gravity works. “You’ll look because I will not ring unless your eyes are on me.”

Juniper’s leaf-ends prick my wrist and she doesn’t say anything out loud and she says everything: don’t run; I’ll chase; you’ll lose and I’ll bite your ankle for it. Page has the grace to stare at the braces that keep the floor honest. Kettle uses his tea to fog the glass in the clock face and draws a crooked smile on it. I look. The bell is a moon with a scar, a ship’s idea of sincerity, a mouth. It is not the bell in the ribbon on a girl’s hand that chased me into laundromats and corners and taught me to make devotion out of hiding. It is not anyone’s toy. I hold its gaze the way you hold the eye of a dog who might be a wolf. My chest aches; the handprint hums like a swallowed hive.

“Ring for a stitch,” I say. “Ring for a hem. Ring so hair remembers how to lie down and catch a shadow without falling in love with it.”

“And your story?” the bell asks. “You don’t get iron for free.”

“I stitched a mouth into water and he put his hand on my chest and forgot to take it back,” I say. My throat does not want to be a throat for these words; it wants to be a tunnel where trains go too fast to make sense of the lights. “He makes quiet and calls it mercy. I make nets and call them manners. A girl once put a bell around my neck and called me Fig. I learned to move without moving. I learned to run my body like a rumor. Now I live under a name that tastes like thread, and the city calls me by it when it wants hemming done fast. I will bring you a better joke than that one if you ring.”

The bell is vain the way all performers are when they’ve heard their own echo too many times. It wants a story that knows how to bow. What I give it is a bruise with a confession pinned to it. Vanity sits down and makes room for complicated compassion. The bell considers the skyline and the decades and the people who kissed under here because they wanted witnesses. It says, “Once,” with an old man’s patience, and then it rings.

The first note is not a sound so much as a pressure the shape of forgiveness. It lifts the hair on my arms and teaches it to face the same way. The second note finds me where the handprint is and lines it with foil. The third draws a line around the city and ties it off at the port so the cranes feel suddenly like they’re wearing tuxedos. Down at Faithful Fade, the pole stops and then goes on turning because its pride is a treadmill. The hair on the floor wakes up and says I remember heads; it asks what it can be now. We tie the bags with the ring still breathing them into nets of edges that will not be used as knives. Juniper kisses the bell with her palms and leaves a green on it that will look like tarnish in a year and be memory in two.

We seed the hair across thresholds as if we were writing a spell that likes doorways. We tuck it into the corners of stoops where the first steps argue with the last ones. We press it into the mouths of drains that like to gossip too much and need reminding about discretion. We lay it along the sill of the hospital fans where the breath comes in overly polite and leaves having learned to swear. Clip sends sweepings from three more shops and a bag of beard that smells like oak and beer and a baby’s first winter. Page sprinkles his desk drawer of pressroom lint over City Hall’s teeth because he always wanted to see the council choke on a question and then answer it. Kettle talks to lightning in the afternoon and tells it not to stand too straight; we need the zigzag for camouflage.

In the middle of all that careful, Soot sends another moth. This one is not polite. It flutters like a slowly torn bandage and sheds ash that decides to be punctuation. It writes on the sidewalk, small and deliberate: hush hush hush hush hush, like a psychiatrist with a grudge. Juniper plants her foot on the last hush and grinds until it makes a noise that sounds like a silverfish changing its mind. The ash tries to be a line that lays itself across my wrist and finds hair there already, an invisible net that tastes like barbershop talk and old songs. The ash catches. The line complains, then does what lines do when they’ve been told where to be: it hums and blends into the seam like it meant to all along.

Highland sits on its hill with its fans like chestfuls of saints. The air under them is relentless and weary and smelling of every hallway where someone failed to keep a promise and then made a new one. Nurses move past in pairs and invisible dozens like shoals; doctors lean their heads against their hands and learn to forget what learning costs. We don’t go inside because sprites don’t go where your shoes squeak the truth into the floor unless the city drags us by the lip. But the breath comes out to us and the fans’ rhythm is a conversation anyone can join if they’re polite. Soot has learned the schedule; he’s been lifting every fourth beat here too, trying to convince the breath to walk with a limp. The hair we’ve laid along the vent mouths wakes when the bell rolls through it; it tangles subtly, not enough to catch air, just enough to snag absence. The lifted beat flutters and fails to rise; it lays down as a grace note and decides to stay there because the song is nice.

He brings his scissor at dusk when the city’s attention is everywhere at once and most of it is at a grill. We feel it before we see it. It is not a blade. It’s a hole held like a tool. He presses it against a fence where we’ve hemmed the alley and the hair hisses like a cat that just remembered it was a cat. The scissor opens. The edges of absence are slick in a way that makes my tongue want to imitate them, and I swallow hard.

We learned yesterday to call confusion into the room like a dog. Today we learn to make it sit. The bell’s ring hasn’t gone out of the net; it’s riding the hair the way a kite rides a child’s stubborn. When he tries to cut, the ring lifts. It doesn’t clang; that would be cruelty. It hums the way a mother hums when she doesn’t want to wake the other children. The scissor’s edge goes out of tune. He tries the other blade—the other absence—and finds it catching on the threshold we laid under the white door with the dent in the bottom where ten pairs of shoes have learned to announce forgiveness and ask for it back. The hair tangles and tells stories; the scissor pauses to listen and loses interest in killing.

Juniper moves like a rumor through the hedge and comes out behind the absence like she knows where behind is for things that are not. She sticks her leaf-ends into the little air he forgot to collect and pulls the shape of the scissor toward her, not to keep, not to break, but to show it the idea of hesitating. Hesitation is a tool. We own it. We teach it.

“You’re making me polite,” Soot says, and the voice of him is contaminated by a laugh he didn’t consent to. “I don’t want to be polite. Polite people lay down their throats on tables and call the knife a guest.”

“You want to be final,” I say. I’m close enough now to feel the absence pressing on the hair. The nets sing with bell-sense and barber talk. “Final is a temper. Temper needs a quench. You forgot to get dipped.”

He tries another gate because he is a connoisseur of throats. He pushes against the lake’s habit; Gate yawns and opens a different mouth. He glances off a hospital fan; the hair licks him and whispers What was the first thing you smelled; he answers without meaning to, and the scissor loses a tooth to memory. He reaches toward the Webster Tube and the tile remembers the squeak of a stroller and refuses to be sharp under his hand.

It isn’t victory. It is the long terrible good work of making an enemy tired. He is infinite in the way habits are infinite. We are specific. He wants to flatten; we want to hem. We spend the dark teaching our own hands how to be stubborn and tender in the same phrase.

We take a break where breaks happen in this neighborhood: a pallet behind a grocery where the fruit smell is tomorrow’s sweetness and today’s regret. Juniper lies on her back with her leaf-ends spread and counts the planes by sound until she gets bored and starts giving them names: Pelican, Show-Off, Late, Divorce. Kettle sits on nothing in particular and drinks whatever tea knows itself to be after it’s had a fight with a memory. I am thread and fur and shadow and machine all at once and none of those things want to share. Maya passes in my head and leaves her laugh on the counter of my mouth. It tastes like salt that forgives you.

“We still need to dull him,” I say. “Edges like to be kept. He keeps his in a drawer that doesn’t exist. I want to make that drawer squeak.”

“Bells,” Kettle says, as if ringing were a spice we had only used on eggs and hadn’t tried on soup. “Not just one. Little ones. Everyday ones. Sermons and schools, yes, but also bicycles, ice cream trucks, somebody’s front door on 45th with that little metal flower. We ring the city like we’re checking if it’s ripe.”

“I don’t like bells,” I say, and no one is impressed.

“Grow up,” Juniper says, with love. “We’ll take the sting out. We’ll put moss in the clappers. We’ll teach them to purr when they think of you.”

We canvas for ring. We walk into the jangle. We let ourselves be startled until startled is bored. The man on the bike with the milk crate full of brooms has a bell that announces itself like a cheek kiss. The woman who sells mangoes has a hand bell she brought from a kitchen two countries ago and it still smells like sugar on the handle. A church lets us into the side chapel where the statues pretend to be sleeping and the rope that rings the big bell coils at our feet like a lazy snake. Juniper climbs the rope and gnaws a little charm into it, a knot in the shape of a lie that turns honest when pulled. I put my hand on the brass ship’s bell in a nautical antique store that’s never been near a boat and whisper a story into it about the first time a gull learned to laugh. The bells respond; some squeak, some purr, some pretend to yawn. The city collects their little tongues into a chorus that doesn’t announce a new hour so much as pet the old ones.

He tests us again where the fans sit with their backs to the sky and their mouths to the hill. He presses his hand onto my chest with the shadow of a shadow, an old trick trying to see if it’s still fashionable. The bell-net hums and my name doesn’t fall out of my mouth even when I sneeze. He whispers hush into the vents and the hair answers with gossip about a boy who fell asleep holding a burrito and dropped it and caught it and fell asleep again and everyone pretended not to notice because mercy. Soot hates mercy when he isn’t the one giving it.

We take our hemming into the sort of places nobody photographs. The recycling yard where the bottles cry about their lost throats and the machines tell them to hush and be useful. The nail shop where acetone persuades patience and girls click their tongues like metronomes. The alley where four cats agree to a treaty they will break by midnight and write it in piss on the wheel of a car that will not move until March. Hair under everything. Soft nets under sharp rooms. Stitches across the places footsteps get cut on.

By the time we’re tired enough to chew the sun and call it bread, the scissor shows itself properly. It is a doorway cut out of whatever you thought this was. It floats in the middle of the street on 16th where the pavement has been patched so many times it is a quilt. It has no shine; it resists description. It wants to be a word; no word wants to be it. People step around it because people are geniuses at not dying and go on eating their tacos as if they are not in the presence of a tool deciding which world it likes better.

Kettle says, not softly, “No,” like a father telling a river to go around. He takes the newspaper from this morning and holds it up and the scissor shivers because papers used to be how endings got delivered. Page arrives with his sleeves rolled and his tie grinning and he throws headlines into the air as if they are pigeons. Juniper hangs hair between the scissor’s open not-blades and tells it a bedtime story about a leaf that learned to cut wind instead of letting the wind cut it. I put my palms up and call the bell through the hair just enough to make the taste of iron reach even the scissor’s nothing. It slows. It considers. It is almost polite.

Soot leans against the idea of a building and smokes a thought. “You’re making everything take longer,” he says, like a complaint inscribed on a couch.

“That’s what hem means,” I say. “Longer. Slower. Stronger. Prettier at the edge.”

He tips his non-head. “You’re borrowing that ring. She won’t let you have it free.”

“She didn’t,” I agree, and the bell hums in my mouth like a penny between teeth. “I paid.”

He tastes the air, and the taste he finds is hair grease and cumin and the kind of sweat that admits it belongs to joy. He withdraws his scissor not because he cannot cut but because the edge isn’t the only interesting thing in the room. He hates that; he loves that; he doesn’t say.

After, we go home on feet that learned to be older during the day. The rosemary tells me a secret it was tired of keeping and I put it behind my ear and it stops hurting. The kitchen window has already found its rectangle; I stand in it and let the light make me a citizen again. Juniper raids the sink as if it were a grocery store for fingers and returns wet and triumphant with news that tastes like copper: the drains have learned a new number. It is nine. It sounds like a door closing on wind. It is good. It is ours.

Maya drops a salmon flick on purpose and I go to it like dignity might be a religion I occasionally attend for the music. She says, “Fig,” and the name is a softness I put my cheek in. The bell, somewhere downtown, is remembering it rang when no one told it to and feels both guilty and handsome. I want to chase the red dot until my heart falls out and someone has to put it back in with both hands. I sit. I list. I choose not to run. My spine becomes a question and then an answer and then a road. The city purrs under my feet with the long sound it keeps for after. The handprint on my chest is still there; I put my palm over it and it doesn’t open. I will dream a laundromat. I will dream hair. I will dream scissors that learn to cut only what asks. I will dream a bell that likes me and a bell I do not like and both of us confessing at the same time and laughing about it.

We sleep wrong, on purpose, in the patch that isn’t quite square. Juniper nests herself into my ribs like a thief admitting love. Outside, Soot writes hush on the air and the air misreads it as hush puppy and goes to find a fryer. The cranes bend because they’re polite and because their backs ache and because they want someone to tell them, you did good, big bird, you carried all that and didn’t complain. Somewhere below us, Gate changes his number just to make me make a face later. Hair under thresholds whispers gossip to shoes. Bells practice pronouncing my name without ringing it like a wound. The city breathes like it has lungs and not a million windows pretending. In the space between breaths, I stitch. I can’t help it. It’s what my hands do when they forgive me.Oakland leans forward when it thinks a test is coming. The cranes take off their politeness and put on something like a brace; the water holds its shoulders tight under a shirt the color of thumbprints; the streets iron themselves into the kind of flat that resists only because it learned from shirts. I taste it in the tap, a metal that wants to become a story, a paperclip on the tongue that keeps the page shut until you deserve it. The drains mutter nine like they’re proud of memorizing a new number and the terns read it back to them in a different key just to be difficult. Juniper wakes before I do and spends a full minute arranging a single leaf-end along my collarbone until it lies like a pencil on a girl’s ear, purpose pretending to be ornament. When she’s satisfied, she taps the handprint on my chest with one knuckle, as if to make sure it hasn’t turned into a door in the night without telling us.

Kettle arrives with morning already made into tea and no apology about how smoke got invited. He does not knock; knocking is for people who are worried about being turned away, and he never asked a door for anything that belonged to him the first time. He says corners the way another person would say amen, and the room decides to grow one by putting a new angle between table and wall as a courtesy. “Flat is his hunger,” he says, rubbing his thumb on the rim of the cup until the steam remembers a very old song about kettles that became boats when no one was looking. “Edges, we gave them work. Bells, we gave them manners. Hair, we gave it gossip and charged it rent. Today we make pleats. You can’t flatten a pleat unless you ask it nicely and promise it a party afterward.”

“Pleats are fancy,” Juniper declares, already upside down in the window because gravity is a suggestion she mistrusts profoundly. “We’ll need ribbon. We’ll need bias. We’ll need the patience of old ladies and seam rippers that only bite when you’re lying to yourself about measurements.”

“The awnings know bias,” I say, feeling every green shade in Fruitvale tilt their stripes willingly into my mouth. “And the accordion bus on International will lend us its middle if we promise to give it back before traffic steals its temper.”

We shop in the city without money because the city already owes us a thousand tiny debts that look like dandelion fluff when you hold them up to the light. The tailor near Seminary whose window hosts three headless mannequins in suits the color of congratulating yourself lets us in early and does not frown when Juniper sleeps in her pincushion like it is a bed for dangerous ideas. She is Tita to the women who bring their mothers’ dresses to be made into daughters’ promises and Ma’am to the men who stare at thread and remember that buttons are as close as some boys come to confessions. “Pleats are dignity,” she says, holding fabric that used to be a curtain up to the sun like she’s checking for God. “Pleats are forgiveness for bodies that forgot they were allowed to change. Don’t make them straight and don’t make them even. They want to breathe.”

The awnings in front of the taqueria have been taking rain seriously for twenty years. They keep the gossip of beans and onions and the way a lime looks at a tortilla and says jump. They also keep a lesson about bias, how to cut across the grain when the grain is tired of being obeyed. I run my fingers along the stripes and feel the angle whisper a freedom I didn’t know I could ask for. We harvest permission, not cloth; the permission drapes across my knuckles and hums in a key the drains will learn if we teach them a trick to put in their pockets. The accordion bus snorts when we ask for a piece of its middle, then sighs the sigh of the overburdened and gives us a stretch of breath that remembers how to fold without breaking. “Bring it back before my 5:30,” she says, not unkind, and a man in the back decides to believe that the world is run by women with schedule books that resist being burned.

Corner-making is a belief. We lay bias along thresholds where the pavement flirts with overstepping and ask the concrete to think of itself as cloth just long enough to bend the exhaustion in it into a different gesture. We pleat fog along the ridge where the hospital sits so the breath it exhales returns to its mouth like a polite child who went out to play and learned a better game and wants to share it. We tuck an extra fold into the wind where it turns at the mouth of the Webster Tube so that the next time Soot reaches for it he finds his hand sliding into a pocket someone else sewed. We practice on the easy corners—porch stairs, fence shadows, the V of two alleys talking to each other—and the pleats hold without fuss. On the hard corner—the seam that runs under us like a hymn with sharp teeth—we call someone older than my vocabulary.

The fault is not a crack so much as a choice the earth made to remember where it likes to come apart. It sleeps loud. It used to be called Hayward when naming things after men was a hobby people mistook for making maps. It calls itself Seam when it speaks to sprites because it likes to be flattered and hates syllables that taste like surveyor. Gate introduces us by rattling his hinge in the modest way of enormous things pretending to be shy. “This is the city’s old yawn,” he says through gritted stone, as if his mouth aches. “Don’t put your fingers in it unless you’re willing to lose a ring.”

Seam wakes like an animal that will never pretend it is anything but an animal. It rolls once and the hills lick their teeth. It remembers all the stomps my grandmother did and respects them as you respect lightning that didn’t choose you today. “You’re the one wearing the scissor’s kiss,” it says lazily, and my ribs decide to sit up very straight and introduce themselves to each other out of awkwardness and hope. “You’ve been hemming where you can. This is where you baste. This is where you make a long stitch and a longer one and you don’t pull tight unless the room tells you how much it can bear.”

Juniper listens with her knees, because she has learned that knees know something about bending that ears pretend is theirs. Kettle puts his palm to the brass surveyor disk set in the sidewalk three blocks away that says BENCH MARK as if it were naming a boy at a party and not an iron witness to the tendency of ground to forget itself when drama calls. I lick the stone out of habit and because I like the taste of old decisions written in cold.

We carry our bias into the seam’s breath. We do not use needle; we use listening. Hair lays across the seam and behaves itself because the bell wrung manners into it and because Clip told it jokes in the barbershop about how to sit still for as long as it takes. We baste a long stitch of rumor, a longer one of neighborhood allegiance, another of grocery lists, and then a whole mess of cheap metal and old faith. Coins are weight, and weight is an argument that silencers hate. The laundromat on 38th and Telegraph coughs up its years of forgotten quarters and nickels and the occasional foreigner that came in a pocket and refused to be spent, and I go down on my stomach and reach under the machine that raised me and feel a city’s worth of grime and childhood tumble into a paper bag printed with a cartoon orange. The machine hums in a voice that is also a cat’s purr and a small engine that refuses to die; it tells me without telling me that I learned everything I know about circles in here and that it’s proud even if I call myself by a sharp name.

We thread weight into the pleats so that when Soot puts his palm on the seam and says lie down now, the earth thinks of soups shared and rent paid and stilts on a carnival and refuses to flatten without a very good reason. We make triangles where we can because triangles laugh at pancakes and transform force into conversation. The curb cuts at every corner are waiting for their chance to be more than convenience; we fold intentions into their little wedges until they are tiny altars to the art of not falling.

Soot tries us in the fragile hour of errands. He doesn’t bother with spectacle. He leans his shadow against a parking structure that has been pretending to be a mountain for twenty years and says nothing. That is how you know he’s working. The quiet that falls is not polite; it is a moist hand over the mouth for just long enough to make you reconsider birthdays. The floors of the structure consider being friends all at once. Three pigeons make an opinion out of themselves and refuse to be mathematics. A boy on the sidewalk looks up with gum between his teeth and realizes he could be a witness if he wanted to.

Pleats hold laughter the way roofs hold arguments. The bias we laid along the lower beams catches the idea of flattening and folds it into the fact of holding. The coins hum in their paper bag under the seam like a choir who discovered harmony by accident and forgave each other in the parking lot after rehearsal. Kettle taps his cup like a stick on a drum and the rumble goes up through the structure’s ankles and coughs a rhythm into the concrete. I clap once and only once and the clap becomes a decision that multiples of feet agree to on different floors, the way stairs convince us that climbing is a good idea if you take pity on them. Juniper pulls at the alley corner with both hands, leaf and will, until the courtyard makes a triangle out of grudges and the weight of the building slips into that geometry and decides to be patient.

People do their part by being themselves. A woman argues with a phone in a voice that refuses to become panic and durably translates into keep breathing even if you don’t want to. A man with a baby strapped to his chest chooses a song that counts to four and then to four again as if the counting itself were keeping them in the hour. The pigeons change careers and become heralds. Soot’s hush presses like fog into a jar. The jar is hair. The jar is bell. The jar is bias that Tita called dignity and I call physics with a crush on skirts. The structure shrugs off the idea of becoming a story told behind hands, and Soot has to pretend he meant to try the next corner anyway.

After, the steam from the hot dog stand makes enough of a cloud to become a parade and we let it, because parades are useful in convincing the air that it loves being moved for reasons other than ambulance sirens. We check the seam with our mouths turned into instruments for learning where your tongue should be, and Seam huffs and rolls once and decides we passed for now. It hates that we’re teaching it to think of stitches as friends, because it prefers to be the kind of myth that is never wrong, but it likes the coins as a flavor and admits it would like one in its imaginary pocket.

“Weight,” Kettle says with the satisfaction of someone who asked for rain and got soup with extra meat. “We should borrow weight from places that won’t miss it for a day.”

“Couch cushions,” Juniper says, feral with delight. “The world is paved with lost metal and people’s ideas about comfort.”

We go on a cushion pilgrimage. Sofas do not surrender their hoards without conversation, so we pay in cat jokes and radio songs written by men who have never met a sprite but still understand the urge to ruin yourself on a chorus. The coins we collect are warm with the heat of naps and late-night confessions and the guilty pleasure of eating chips too loud while a parent slept in the other room. We string them into a garland that clinks like a promise and sash the seam until it looks like a sash across the hips of a giant learning to dance.

He doesn’t stop. He never stops; he only adjusts his appetite. He tries the Caldecott like he thinks tunnels will be loyal just because they get visited by breath that is certain of its job. The fans there are older than the ones in the Webster; they believe in keeping smoke’s story to themselves and exhale it only after it has been taught grammar. We taste ash that is not ours, the kind from far away that comes to lecture us about forests we forgot by mistake, and Soot grows taller around that taste as if he brought a friend to explain that mercy is better when you measure it in acres. We don’t argue with the fire’s grief because grief is a religion with its own bells. We pleat the smoke gently so it can be useful when it wants to and out of the way when it needs to nap. The fans learn a new beat with extra kindness in the middle. Soot sulks in the corner like a man whose best joke was told better by a child.

The barber pole sends sweepings in brown paper that claim to be heavy and lie, because hair weighs nothing and everything at once. Clip ties them with twine that brag about binding newspapers before phone screens decided they wanted to be friends with thumbs more than eyes. I lay the sweepings where the scissor likes to hover—above the seam, between hospital and hill, under the bus stop bench where a girl taught herself to cry without anybody knowing—and the hair performs its new purpose with a discipline the military would envy. It is a net that acts like a rug. It is a rug that acts like a map. It is a map that acts like a hand placed palm up for someone to step into because the curb is too high.

By afternoon, even our clever is tired and smells like cumin. Maya comes and goes, leaving behind a sentence that starts and ends with Fig and has a chunk of salmon for a comma. I practice not leaping because leaping is a religion you can’t tithe to if you are serious about protecting a city. I walk and take my prize and let her laughter drape my ribs with forgiveness that I pretend is just weather. Juniper eats three drops of dishwater like she’s getting away with something and then grows serious because the handprint on my chest warms like the really old part of a stove nobody uses unless they love stew.

“His next quiet will be under a name,” she says, rearranging crumbs into triangles as a spell. “He’ll try to hush a place so it forgets what it is called. Not a street. A name on a sign. Something that made itself into an invitation.”

Names hold walls up the way bolts hold happiness. We go to the sign that says LAKE MERRITT in confident letters and discover that the paint woke up with its bedhead on purpose. We go to the sign that says BART and discover the T would rather be a chair today. We go to the sign that says EMERGENCY and find nine breaths standing at attention behind it like soldiers who know that attention can be love when it’s not trying to be a posture. He wants to pull the vowels out. He wants the names to forget how to pronounce themselves and lay down. We outline the letters in hair and bell, not thinly but with a sureness that refuses to be elaborated upon. We add coins not for weight but for luck and a little greed because greed can be convinced to protect when it thinks the treasure belongs to it.

He sends a letterpress of hush—a piece of silence printed with expectation—and it lands on my wrist like a thin passport to another throat. It tries to slide into my palm and make my hand a road. I let it. I let it up to the first line on my hand, the one that someone once told me was the life line and someone else told me was a river because they liked the sound of lying. Juniper bites the air above my skin and the bite becomes a little bite-shaped pleat and the press hitches on it and refuses to be smooth. I fold the silence once. I fold it twice. I slip it under a floorboard where secrets meet after work and tell it it can have a drink if it doesn’t smoke inside.

The work becomes like bread dough. You knead until your knuckles remember they belong to a body, then you let it rest while you pretend you didn’t think about it while it slept, and then you knock on it with two fingers to see if it will admit to air. We knead corners into the city. We let the city rest. When we knock on it, the sound comes back deep enough to tell us we did not make a cake by mistake. The cars argue in circles and somebody at a light on Foothill decides to spin his tires on the blacktop and translate the wish to be seen into smoke that is not fire, and I take that smoke and pleat it into the corner so the air has something to hold that is not terror. We are not approving. We are repurposing. The sirens will be here in a minute, and I teach them to unlatch their jaws just enough to swallow what they need and spit out what they don’t.

By evening the scissor decides to be brave in front of other people. It opens under a streetlight on 23rd and Telegraph where teenagers teach bicycles to write their names and men discuss history with paper cups that smell like grain admitting mistakes. It isn’t a thing that could be photographed without the camera lying for its own safety, but everyone feels the temperature change in the heart of the light. People step left because left is a language the city keeps in its pocket for emergencies. A woman pushes her grocery cart into a V between worlds and becomes geometry’s mother. Kettle reads the sports page to the scissor, which is either insult or magic depending on whether you think games matter. Page shows up with ink on his fingers and writes a headline but doesn’t publish it; the scissor recognizes restraint and pauses in appreciation of something it doesn’t know how to do.

I hum the bell into the hair and the hair answers with the low dignity of men who get shaved on Saturdays because their daughters say they look like presidents when they are smooth. Juniper presses moss into the light pole as if teaching it to purr. The scissor hums back, and in the hum I hear something that is not Soot. The scissor is an idea. It wants to cut because cutting is how it proves it is not a door. The door is a compromise. The scissor thinks it is integrity. The hum is a stubborn child’s foot on a step. I talk to it the way I talk to my bones when they decide to have opinions about gravity. “Not the names,” I say without saying. “Not the throats. Cut coupons. Cut hair. Cut me a pattern and I’ll sew you something to be proud of.”

Soot leans into the light like a man leaning into a joke. “You want to hire my weapon,” he says with no heat because heat is for other wars. “You want to give it domestic duties. That’s cruel, thread-sprite. You’ll make it resent weddings.”

“Everything resents weddings a little,” I say, and think of Tita’s hands and the way fabric tries to be honest and then fails and then forgives itself. “We’re not domesticating. We’re apprenticing.”

“Apprentices turn into masters,” he says, not warning me but himself. “Masters turn into rules. Rules are just another kind of quiet.”

“Maybe,” I say, and the hair says maybe too and the bell chooses not to ring because it learned a different kind of pride today. “But this is the kind that lets the soup boil and not burn. You like burned. This is the kind that keeps the bed lumpy enough to feel like a body slept there before you did. You like bed smooth as floor. Take that to therapy.”

He does not know he wants therapy. He knows he wants to stop hearing stories he did not author and he knows we are writing ourselves into places he considered promised to him. He reaches for the hospital fans because he cannot help himself. The hair catches his fingers at the nail, whispers what did you smell first, and he mutters coal without meaning to and the ring grins like a child who just learned where a penny goes when it disappears. He presses the seam and the pleat turns him into a corner. He tries to lay a sign down and the name stands up taller because Page once loved it in print and love makes ink heavy. He withdraws not because he cannot do harm but because the work of harm has become tedious and he has a weakness for art.

Night takes off its jacket and reveals it has shoulders. The bay condenses and then forgets it did because it is practicing humility for tomorrow’s tourists. The cranes hold their bow for an extra beat because they like theater; we clap in our bones because clapping out loud would make neighbors mad and we like them. Maya steps over me with a bowl of something she tasted with her finger and licked and then pretended she did not and I admirer her skill in lying to herself with good humor. “Fig,” she says, and the world clicks into its socket and I am ridiculous with relief.

We sleep and the seam sleeps loud, and in the dream I make a quilt. I do not know how to make a quilt; I steal the knowledge from a grandmother’s lap that is not mine and do not apologize. The patches are made of bus transfers and fish scales and the word EXIT painted in a hundred greens. The binding is bias cut from awnings that saved kisses from rain. The batting is hair. The quilting is a line that runs like a creek and is a creek and chooses to be a line only when somebody is looking and worried about getting their shoes wet. The quilt covers the planet and the planet laughs because it is ticklish, and Soot sits on the edge of the bed and sulks and then stops sulking because the quilt is warm and warmth is a gateway drug to becoming a citizen.

Morning comes around the corner with eggs and a list of errands. The handprint on my chest is awake before I am and rehearsing a speech about how I am not finished with him and he is not finished with me and one of us will have to admit that the word finished belongs to carpentry, not war. Juniper eats a crumb of toast and arranges a crumb into a triangle and then into a fan and then into a pleat until it looks like a small city and then eats that too because she refuses to be sentimental when carbohydrates exist. Kettle reads a headline about tides as if it were about hearts and says, “He’ll try churches today,” without looking at either of us because he loves us too much to use our faces as mirrors before coffee.

Church bells and I are a history I did not agree to but live inside like promises sewn into the hem of a dress you borrow for court. We go anyway. We bring moss for the clappers and hair for the edges and bias for the doors so that when the ring comes, it will land like a hand on a cheek and not like a knife between ribs. The first bell we find is cracked and proud about it; the second is too clean and embarrassed; the third is the kind of bell that believes in cake after, regardless of sins. We teach them to purr. We teach them to speak without waking the baby and still be heard by the man on the corner who pretends to be deaf to excuses and isn’t.

Soot arrives on a breath that the choir expected. He puts his palm to the hymn just where it would swell for the high notes and tells it to go flat like a teacher who hates joy. The bell remembers our lesson and refuses to perform for him. It rings for bread broken politely, not for knives raised in shame. The hair around the door catches his silence and asks it to wait its turn. The bias lets the procession bend without losing coherence. The scissor shows up late and sits in a pew suspiciously and then bows its head because it cannot resist being mistaken for piety.

“Polite,” Soot says, bitter as oversteeped tea. “You’re teaching the city to behave. It’ll behave itself into a museum.”

“You confuse manners with embalming,” I say, and we both taste the morgue and decide to be nicer to nurses when we can. “I don’t want silence where the living is. I want corners so secrets have somewhere to sit without becoming weapons. I want pleats so the day can expand and contract without splitting.”

He rolls that around like a coin he is not sure he wants to spend. “You talk like pages,” he says finally, and Page salutes with a pencil he found behind his ear and the kind of grin that earned him three warnings and a plaque. “You talk like this place has a right to be complicated.”

“It does,” I say, and the bell agrees, and the hair grins, and the seam snores in the background with a satisfaction you only hear after a job done by a team that didn’t ask for a photograph. “It does and it will, even when you sit on its bed and tell it to lay down. We will always put too many springs in the mattress. We will always sew the corner wrong on purpose so it looks hand done. We will always carry coins. We will always clap on two and four.”

He stands in the door and takes the ring of a small bell in his hand and does not ring it. He puts it down with care, which is the only kind of victory anyone should trust. He leaves a moth on the hymn and the moth becomes a note that cannot make up its mind between major and minor and lives as a hinge in the song. The choir sings around it like champions. Juniper falls asleep on the back of a chair and drools. Kettle pours tea into the shadow of a cross and calls it a miracle because he is in a good mood.

We walk out into a city that refuses to be finished. The cranes bend their necks and then straighten them again just to stretch. The bay studies itself and chooses to be both mirror and hand. The fault practices its lines in case it gets a callback. The fans keep their rhythm with a small swagger that they try to hide. Maya passes us on the sidewalk and says “Fig” into a little square that pretends to hold whole conversations and I live a whole second in the echo and come out intact. I smell scissors going dull enough to be used for opening letters. I smell hair under thresholds getting ready to gossip about shoes. I smell bells learning restraint. I smell Soot discovering that politeness is a drug that makes people argue better instead of worse. And under all of that, I smell coins, honest metal with a hundred mouths, singing patience under the wrong floor at the right time, exactly as long as we need.

The drains tap nine and then a reluctant ten that tastes like glass taught for the first time how to be a window and not a knife. We turn our ears to the pipes and the pipes give us the next equation: triangles and weight, bells and gossip, corners and names. It’s not poetry. It’s scaffolding. It will do until we need to climb.Chapter 8

Oakland hums different when the wires are nervous. It is not the showy way of a storm rehearsing, not the rattling of windows that makes tea cups tattle on the shelf. It’s smaller and nearer to the bone, a shy wobble under the sidewalk that steps with you and then steps wrong and pretends it didn’t. I taste it on the tap like a paperclip held too long between the teeth. The transformers along 34th are all throat and no tune. The streetlights, which have been behaving since we made the bells polite, take too long to give up and then surrender like actors who forgot their lines and hope applause will forgive them. I wake with my mouth full of a noise I didn’t make. It sticks to the roof of me and calls itself electricity as if that name were a pardon and not a job description.

Kettle arrives with his tea and a look that says the cup is a map I should know by now how to read. He takes the chair like a dock, makes the steam sit up straight, and turns his ear so the lobe faces the window. “Hummingbone,” he says, and the word drops a small hammer down my spine that hits each vertebra and makes them sing a prayer to bolts. “He’s after the tide that doesn’t take water. If he flattens the grid, we’ll get a quiet that thinks it’s mercy and turns out to be a locked door. You can stitch throats all day; if the breath doesn’t get made in the first place, we’re sewing beautiful mouths onto mannequins.”

Juniper hangs upside down from the curtain and arranges one leaf-end along the glass until it points at a sag in the wire three houses down. She sniffs and her nose says ozone like an apology someone practiced in the mirror too long. “Switches,” she says, making the c into something sharp. “He’ll talk to the big beasts and say sleep. He’ll call it Sabbath, like a thief with a favorite psalm.”

Page slides in between seconds with ink on his fingers and a grin that has never respected curfews. He sets a folded square on the table; it’s the color of mistakes and the headline bites. ROLLING OUTAGES POSSIBLE, the paper says as if it had a choice, as if Soot didn’t read meetings over the shoulders of men who love flow charts more than their own laundry. “He’s going to ride official notices like they’re saints,” Page says, as if editorializing could give the lines their blood back. “He’ll hitch his hush to our yes, let it come in the door with the men who have clipboards, and then keep it past closing.”

We go where humming lives like cattle. The substation between Mandela and West Grand stands in its field of metal with its coat off. Rows and rows of gray animals breathe in a rhythm you don’t notice until they hold it. Ceramic bells grip their throats; copper shines where hands have respected it; fences make their case eloquently and then continue to fail rats on principle. The yard smells like rain that decided not to bother and the green of old money. The air has a taste at the back of it that remembers lightning without bragging. The humming is a low organ note that learned its tune from the planet and then put itself in human shoes; you can walk the sidewalk to it and think you came up with the rhythm yourself if you’ve never had reason to learn humility.

“Don’t touch anything that thinks it’s a sky,” Kettle says mildly, and his eyes go serious in that way that makes even Juniper consider obedience for a blink. The fence looks at me in a tone I have heard from saints and crossing guards. I slide my fingers just under its voice and the mesh sighs and remembers that it used to be ore in a mountain that talked to water for sport. It lets us in sideways, the way a city will let you cut across a lot if you say please with the right foot.

The yard’s keeper lifts his head when I breathe copper on purpose. He is not like Gate, not hinge and tide, and he is not like Page with his punctuation swagger. He is a stack of oxen wearing a crown of porcelain. His name is Switch when he wants it simple, Bishop when he is feeling handsome, and Buzz when the work turns to lifting without poets. He is old in the way tools are old: used, cleaned, used again, cracked, patched, and still proud enough to demand a wage in respect if not dollars. “Thread,” he says, tasting my stitches and the bell’s ring as if testing whether metal got into it. “Leaf. Kettle. You brought coins. You brought hair. You brought the taste of bells. That’s smart and insufficient. You’ll need tinsel and the ghosts of balloons.”

Juniper claps and nearly falls off the porcelain she has no business standing on. “Mylar,” she says, too loud in a yard where loud does not belong, and Switch pretends not to hear because pretending not to hear is how you keep old gods from being embarrassed by children. “We’ll bake an antenna out of party leftovers,” she whispers in her right voice. “We’ll make shine that refuses to be quiet.”

The fence is a treasure map if you look with the parts of your eyes that enjoy believing. Gum wrappers have collected on the wind like fish scales; we fold them into flags and thread them onto hair. A star of Christmas tinsel turned funeral ribbon by a winter rain plants itself on the gate and we teach it to glimmer without deciding to be lightning. Someone’s busted helium balloon is strangled in a snag behind the transformer that calls itself Ox when it feels like remembering how to be single. We rescue it, peel the dirt off gently, and write a word onto the silver with our breath: hum. The letters won’t last when the weather gets arrogant again, but the shape of them will, and that’s enough to give the listening somewhere to stand.

I stitch hair into the yard without touching what wants to kill me on principle. I lay a net along the inside of the fence where the rats have chewed a story out of metal and not died from it yet, and I promise the story an ending if it behaves. I hang coin-weighted threads from ceramic bells like modest jewelry that knows it’s mending a throat. I rub rust into the feet of the gray animals who carry the load so they remember the taste of dirt and don’t betray us to air. Juniper scampers beneath the bus bars with a seriousness that should be contagious and presses moss into angles the way a nurse presses gauze against a cut you got from pretending a door wasn’t a door. Kettle stands in the mouth of the yard where the men in hard hats will stand later, and breathes tea steam into the morning until the porcelain blushes with it and becomes polite.

Soot arrives without arriving. The hum drops not like a stone but like a thought that decided to be shy on the stairs. The animals learn stillness the way water learns ice. Ox lowers his head into his own chest and pretends to be asleep so hard he almost gets away with it. A moth lands on the edge of a bus bar and is ash without ceremony and I hate Soot for making me think it looked like one of his moths. The quiet that comes is not lullaby and not grand; it is the sound of a hand laid on a mouth while everyone else at the table goes on talking and pretending the hand isn’t there. The porcelain clinks delicately as if cutlery were nervous.

Bishop grinds the teeth he will deny he has. “He’s bringing fog as a blanket,” he says, and I can taste it now, the wet that wants to make the wires forget their skin. “He’ll flirt with arc and then smother it. He doesn’t want drama. He wants an absence so thorough even thunder is mid-sentence forever.”

We cheat the fog the way dressmakers cheat a stubborn curve. Juniper pleats it into lace by dragging leaf through air until the droplets get flirtatious and forget why they came. I lay mylar flags in the path of a silence moth and it blends itself into its own reflection with enough confusion that it prefers to be clever elsewhere. Kettle exhales into porcelain and the steam climbs and sits in the lips of insulators like a cat who knows who owns the house. The hair hums with bell-sense caught in it yesterday and refuses to become a wick for a dead thing. Coins click under the bus and teach the morning to keep time.

He presses his hand against my chest without asking me and I taste pennies and a long hallway with linoleum and the shape of a sigh that was supposed to be a scream. For a beat the hum goes out of my body, and I am only animal in the way that makes me mutter at mice in dreams and sharpen my feet on a rug. Juniper’s teeth on air above my wrist pull me back. She never bites me when I wear a human shape; she bites the moment like a seam ripper, makes the stitch of his quiet pop one by one, and hands me the thread that was tied wrong in my ribs. I stuff the wrong thread into my mouth. I chew. It tastes like the copper side of a battery and three broken promises. I swallow it and have to cough to own my name again.

Switch takes the breath he had put away for bad days and spends it now. He flexes the articulations nobody gives him permission to admit to. Ox shifts his weight like a bull who has learned ballroom. The hum stutters, then lifts, then slips past Soot’s hand the way a fish who believes in itself slides past a child’s net. It isn’t victory; it’s cleverness made into a rope we pulled taut just long enough to give daytime a chance to use its key on every clock in town. The lights along Mandela blink with the guilt of bulbs that thought they might get to nap and then didn’t. A bus with a face like a sigh pulls her shoulders back and chooses to be dignified about doing the job she promised.

He pushes elsewhere. The West Oakland BART yard is a field of bright teeth and he wants to pull them. Trains gulp current like athletes between sprints; he tries to cork their mouths. We lay curl after curl of foil along the fence line and hang hair-nets between metal posts like ghosts of laundry on a day the weather couldn’t commit. The trains complain in a way that makes them sound like men who had to do laundry too young and never learned to like it, and then they get over themselves and sing with the hum we fed them out of party trash. Soot hates that sort of magic. It’s beneath him. He can’t believe the things that make people forgive each other can also make wires remember their job.

Afternoon leans in its chair and decides to nap, because afternoon always decides to nap right when it ought to be watching. Rolling outages nick the edges of neighborhoods we love and everyone behaves in a way that makes you want to kiss the city and apologize at the same time. At the light on 51st a man holds up a cardboard sign with handwriting that could be a priest’s or a boy’s and cars believe him with their windows. The woman at the mango cooler rings a bicycle bell she keeps under the table because she likes the sound and not because anyone told her to, and the bell hears the bell in the Tribune and rings honest and easy. The fans at the hospital sweep the air in the same rhythm they had when the lights were on and only the drop in gossip at the nurses’ station tells me anything changed.

Night plans to be First Friday and all the artists’ ghosts hear the rumor and put on their good shoes. Telegraph is a throat we have been hemming for a week and I can feel the stitches hold under the weight of ten thousand feet inventing the same street at the same time. Drums made of buckets discover religion; kids turn the white lines into balance beams and then laws, then joy. Soot sends his hush into the mix like a drunk man whispering secrets too close to your mouth. It reaches for the drums first, of course it does; noise with pride is his favorite meal. The hair near the rim of the buckets catches the silence and teaches it to be a rhythm. The men with sticks grin with all the teeth they brought and, without being told, drop on the two and four like the city used to be a church.

The lights on Telegraph cough and then fix their collars and pretend they were always going to go brown at this hour. The generators behind food trucks cough too and then remember they are gods in bad tempers and make the hot oil sing forgivingly. Soot tries to quiet a mural. He pushes his palm against a painted face with three eyes and the face looks back and does not blink, because Page whispered to it about ink and promises yesterday and paint loves ego as much as men do. The hush that doesn’t work on drums tries for roller skates and fails because wheels are the last thing in the world that can be asked to lay down. Kettle orders us to drink water with the authority of a man who made a deal with lightning to keep his friends and the water is warm and perfect and tastes like the inside of a hose from childhood and I love the city like it invented throat.

Maya loses the lights at home and behaves like a competent animal, which is to say she makes fire with a sigh. Candles find their old song on the shelf and set the room’s edges to breathing. I stand in the rectangle that isn’t a rectangle anymore and watch flame bloom like a gossip I am finally qualified to enjoy. The red dot is in the room, because candlelight makes a hundred bad decisions and one of them is to fling coins along the floor by accident. My back becomes a question. My feet invent traction. My whole body when it remembers itself remembers running in shapes no human respects. I do not pounce. I walk as if dignity were a leash I like being led by. Maya laughs and my name goes soft and round again, Fig, and lands behind my ear where I keep mercy.

Juniper sits on the back of a chair and watches flame with her chin in both hands like a girl who just learned about confession and refuses to tell unless you bribe her with sugar. “He’ll go for the hills,” she says into the wax like it already knows. “He’ll try to smooth them because they’re a rebuke. He’ll think landslide is a love song if he doesn’t listen to the words.”

“We pleated the seam,” I say, and the wine-colored wax obeys gravity like a gentleman falling down a staircase on purpose. “He can press until his palm remembers it is ash. The hills like their backs ugly. They aren’t leaving a party because a man in a suit said the dress code changed.”

Kettle comes in through the window by way of pipe and unpleasant math and pretends he came through the door because he likes the ritual of it. He pours tea for the candle because that is the sort of man he is and the candle smokes a little in appreciation. “He’s not finished with the humming,” he says, with the cheer of someone trying to be honest and kind at once. “Brownouts are appetizers for him. He wants a laydown. He wants to hear hospital breath forget the beat. The bells bought us manners; the hair stitched courtesy into the air; the bias made corners into friends. Tomorrow we floss the city. We string the hum between teeth that never met and we ask it to sing like one mouth.”

I sleep with the sound of wires that refused to quit and my grandmother’s feet thumping in the memory under my pillow. I dream the substation as a pasture with gray animals blinking their porcelain eyes at me like a child with a case of unearned shyness. I dream Ox lowering his head into my hand with the carefulness of a thing that could kill me by accident and choosing not to. I dream a balloon we wrote hum on going up into a sky that learned how to read because we were obnoxious and patient and stuck around while it practiced.

Morning opens with a little more edge than we asked for. The wires have the nerve to sing in a sharp key. The transformers imitate sheep who are not sure the fence is still a courtesy. I go in my mouth to the place where names sit and make sure mine isn’t missing; it isn’t, but the handprint on my chest has learned to purr a little and I have not forgiven it for being good at that. Juniper steals the sardine she isn’t owed as a preemptive celebration because she believes in rewarding outcomes before they happen and calling it good luck. Kettle reads a horoscope about patents and mistakes and decides it’s about us because he is sick and tired of pretending the stars are for people who pay attention to ink and not rust.

We make stringers for the hum out of things that belong to kitchens and garages. The fencing wire behind the garden is a choirleader if you hum into it long enough. We cut pieces of it with teeth and with dignity and lay them across alleys like a secret only air will gossip properly. We collect the tails from mylar balloons that decided to retire into trees and tie them not to the grid because we are not fools who want to die as a lesson, but to the chain-link that likes to be bossy and not wrong. We tuck hair into the ears of ceramic insulators so quietly that if they had mothers they would cry about the invasion of privacy and then feed us more soup. We run coins along the lower rails where the hum likes to put its elbows when it thinks no one is watching and teach them clatter as an art.

Soot brings fog without water, dust without weight, and quiet without redemption. He covers the yard with a hand held high enough to become a roof and low enough to hit your hair. The hum lifts like someone trying not to cough at a funeral and then coughs anyway. The animals protest out of politeness and then out of pride. Ox tries to remember what it is to be animal when you live as a rumor of danger. Bishop counts to ten and then pretends he didn’t because counting is beneath kings and necessary to survival. The silence moths arrive in a chalky cloud and write hush across our nets as if we asked for their signature and forgot to leave a pen.

We trick them with the taste of celebration. The mylar sings. It is an ugly sound that becomes beautiful because it refuses to be tuned. The foil flags throw someone else’s sun into a morning that was trying to be modest. The hair hums with dust we invited that wasn’t his, the kind that collects in corners where dancing happens, the kind that smells like sweat and spilt cola and the footwork of a night you didn’t want to end because being that many people at once felt like proof. The nets take the weight of his hand because they were built to carry groceries and confessions and the air rolls under. Not all of it, but enough.

He touches me because he is learning that I am a switch I do not consent to be. His fingers, which are very proud of not having fingers, lay their shadow on my throat and tell the city inside me to shush. My tongue wants to play God and fail. My whisker that is not a whisker wants to know how fast red can run. Juniper kicks the underside of my jaw with a grace that would make ballet whisper into its pillow and be jealous. Kettle puts a hand on my back and for a second his palm is as wide as a county and the weight of it is good. I cough the quiet out like a coin I choked on because greed and a bell under the Tribune rings without ringing because I told it I love it and meant it.

We keep the hum from laying down and being dead. We do not make it proud. We teach it to be stubborn. The lights stay a little dimmer because we aren’t anyone’s saviors and because miracles ruin neighborhoods faster than arson. The fans at the hospital stay in the pocket and we keep the beat with them. The trains shrug and decide to get passengers where they said they would because that is a kind of politeness and politeness is a kind of religion when you don’t have time for the hard ones. Soot pulls his hand back slow like a man taking his hat off and deciding whether to leave or sit. He does neither. He lingers and I hate him for that because lingering is a trick I believed I invented in a kitchen under a sun patch I took and called mine.

After, Switch takes a breath he will deny and laughs once and calls it pressure release. Ox looks like an animal that remembered it has knees. The fence puckers and pretends it meant to look flirtatious. The mylar flags are tired in a hungover way that makes them flirt with shame; the hair has seen worse and refuses to judge. We pick up our coins and leave some because greed, invited when supervised, becomes a guard as well as a sin. We thank the yard without saying thank you because flattery makes wires vain, and vanity in wires gets people dead.

We walk over Mandela shaking with adrenaline that tastes like your first wrong kiss. The sky thinks about being kind and then chooses to be real. Juniper runs her leaf along the top of a chain-link fence until the metal sings a little and blushes; this is her vanity and I let her have it because she only ever hurts what can be hurt and forgive you while you’re doing it. Kettle whistles a song that used to get men paid and now gets them coffee. I lick my teeth and remember the shape of a leash and let the memory sit at the edge of the rug like an old dog. The handprint on my chest purrs like a mistake you would make again.

Maya is home and alive and making something out of beans and sentiment. She watches the kettle without hurrying it and uses the back of the spoon on bread to decide if it deserves butter. When she sees me she says Fig in her inside voice and then louder because she steps on the place in the rug that announces visitors. I walk where I meant to and do not run. She drops a bit of salmon as if a hand slipped while writing a letter to a friend she wanted to impress and I pretend not to notice her noticing me notice. We forgive each other for the theater because love is a factory of rituals and I have always been good with small machines.

Night will bring another test; we can feel it in the glass. The hills are practicing shrugging in a way that will let them blame gravity if anyone asks rude questions. The seam clears its throat as if to say it was always going to do that and everyone should calm down. The cranes at the port bend and then blink and then hold because they are polite and because their backs hurt and because they like applause they pretend not to hear. The fans at the hospital purr with goat-bell grace. The bells in the churches are asleep with one eye open like cats and their dream is of soup and cutting words into digestible pieces.

I stand in the window and let the night show me its shoulder. I lay my hand over the print on my chest and feel nothing but the heat my own stubborn made by refusing to lay down and be quiet when silence said please like a liar. Juniper sets up triangles of crumbs on the table and turns them into pleats with the side of her finger and then into lines again because she cannot abide a straight path and I am glad. Kettle drinks the last of the tea and uses the leaves to read a future that contains my grandmother’s feet, a red dot we will chase and not catch only to declare that mercy, and hair under thresholds learning to tell jokes. We will floss the city until its breath sweetens even in the corners that think they don’t deserve to smile. We will tie the hum to itself until it has too many friends to be lonely when he leans in and calls it bed. We will take naps wrong and on purpose until our bones remember joy. We will not let him lay us down flat and call it love. We will not let him make our children into paper. We will not let the bells learn arrogance or the hair get bored or the coins decide they prefer font to throat. We will keep our hands warm. We will mend. We will mend again. We will mend until our mending becomes the story and the story refuses to finish because it has somewhere to be.Chapter 10

Oakland wakes with a finger between its pages and the sense that someone is trying to shut the book. The air in the morning is not shy, but it is considerate in a way that makes you check your pockets for a list you didn’t write. Street signs blink their paint and decide to be very legible. The wires above Telegraph murmur names they learned from pigeons and programmers, a glossary of the city’s bad habits and good jokes. Under all of it, running like a spine that likes order and still forgives chaos, I hear the catalog breathe. It is the breath of drawers that know where the maps sleep, of labels that stick and occasionally lie, of barcodes that learned to hum because they were tired of being scanned without courtesy. The catalog is a song about finding things without flattening them. It is the opposite of Soot’s wish, and that makes it a throat I have to guard.

Kettle comes with his tea and talks to the steam as if it were a witness in a trial he intends to win without ever raising his voice. He sets the cup on the table with the hush of a judge and doesn’t look at me, which is how you say important things to shapes that scatter when light stares too hard. “He’s going to the stacks,” he says, as if someone told him the tide would forget its lines and he was choosing not to panic. “Not to burn, not to brag. To press. He wants the finding systems to take a nap and the margins to stop being brave. If the indexes lay down, the city loses the trick that keeps stories from drowning in themselves.”

Juniper is upside down on the curtain, an exclamation point that refuses to end in a dot. She flips and lands on the windowsill, leaf-ends tidying the light as if it needs combing. “Paper cuts,” she says, delighted and grim. “He loves polite pain. He’ll make the air taste like a tongue pressed to a stamp and think that’s mercy. He’ll pull all the due dates into a single quiet and call it rest.”

Page slides in with ink on his hands that looks like he lost a war and enjoyed it. He has a clipping folded into a square; the headline has teeth because Page makes everything bite if it wants to be remembered. “MAIN LIBRARY HOURS EXTENDED,” the paper says, as if generosity would help when a hush wants to use your kindness against you. Page grins because he knows it will and we know it will and we’re going anyway. “He’ll hide behind goodwill and knock over the sign that says reference, not to make a joke, but to insist the word stop meaning what it means.”

We go where finding lives like a religion with a very good basement. The Main Library waits on 14th like a woman who knows how many revolutions a dress can attend and still be dignified. The steps are practiced at gathering feet who carry questions too heavy to fit in a pocket. The lions at the gate pretend to be stone because their pride is old, but their whiskers twitch when children run past with a hard-cover confidence that says the world belongs to anybody who can afford to ask for it with both hands. Inside, the breath changes. It becomes the polite inhale of carpet and the exhale of pages when they remember they were trees and decide to be generous about it. The elevator blinks its honesty. The desks weld their corners together with the small noises of pencils. The hum is the same hum as wires and tides and kitchens and trains, except it’s wearing a cardigan and pretending to be smaller than it is.

She is waiting at the desk with the black glasses that magnify attention, not eyes. She is Ms. Ledger when she is not being kind and Dianne when she is and Ledger when she tells the catalog to fetch without raising her voice. Her hair is gathered like a comma at the nape of a sentence that could argue you out of your foolishness gently. She smells like paper that remembers rain and the soap people use when they intend to shake hands with mayors. Her hands are ringed with the ghosts of date stamps. She looks at me as if she’s seen a hundred sprites and a thousand men pretending not to be, and does the only correct thing: she nods once like we share a job and she knows the hours. “You’re late,” she says, and her mouth doesn’t smile because mouths don’t do heavy lifting before ten. “He’s in the indexes. He likes logical doors. He hates surprise the way I hate ellipses.”

We go down first because that’s where catalogs keep their hum quiet. The stacks under the stacks are a grid a mathematician would propose to a lover. The aisle numbers know their alphabet like a prayer, and the rolling shelves like to flirt but only if you respect their weight. The fluorescent light tries very hard not to hum; it hums anyway because electricity has pride. The long drawers of the old card catalog still live here because Ms. Ledger is sentimental and honest in the same breath. The drawers purr when she’s near. They hiss when Soot is near.

He’s not ash down here. He’s an eraser smudge that learned how to make a shadow. He moves like a hand taught to underline and then told never to do it again. He says nothing because silence is what he romances; he doesn’t want to talk before he’s had his way. The hush he brings is not holy. It’s the sort of quiet that makes your ears think they forgot themselves. The cards shudder. The drawers complain without language and then try to be brave because they saw wars before and love men whose hands shook while they wrote. The indexes go soft at the edges the way bread regrets its ambition on a humid day, and I love them too much to let that stand.

I do what they taught me in laundromats and kitchens: I stitch a margin. I pull thread out of my eyes, because that’s where light lives when it pretends it isn’t light. It’s the color of the white space on a page when a poet stops so you can swallow, and the color of dust in a beam when a child is made of knees. I twist it with shadow until it becomes map-strong. I lay it along the sides of the catalog drawers and press it into the grain with a penny I stole fair and square from under the fridge last week. The metal tastes like good decisions and machine oil and church pantries. Coins are gossip that forgot to become law; they are weight that can be taught manners. I tell the margins to hold when the hand presses. The margin hums back like something that learned from sheet music and cookbooks both.

Juniper goes after the stamps like they owe her money. She finds the old ones, the heavy ones, the wooden handles with a municipality’s patience in their wrinkles. She inks the pad with moss she keeps under her tongue for emergencies and presses a date on the hush. It doesn’t like being handled. It doesn’t like being told it arrived and will leave, because it dreams of forever and flattening. The stamp bites and leaves a bright wet Monday in the middle of the quiet, which refuses to dry because time has teeth when you insist on it. She stamps again and again until the hush begins to stutter into a calendar, which is how you make a bully go to school.

Ms. Ledger opens the calendar into which we are sewing ourselves by tapping two fingers on a screen that tries to pretend it is calm. The beep that answers has not learned song but it wants to, and Page leans near and whispers a subheading until the beep knows to get proud once a day and not more. Kettle stands with a spine against a pillar and breathes tea into a room that understands what steam is for. He watches Soot the way rivers watch men pretending to control them, and when the hush leans hard, Kettle coughs once into his cup and the metal in the shelves remembers earthquakes and forgiveness and refuses to lay down.

He puts his hand on my chest because he always does when we make a throat out of a room. The print of him warms as if shame could be heat. For a beat I taste glue and cardboard and the dust that collects in the bottom of drawers when no one thinks to love them properly. It’s almost pleasant, which is how you know it’s dangerous. I say my name inside my mouth and press it into the roof with my tongue the way a cat presses a bell into silence. It hurts, and that’s a kind of comfort. The bell at the Tribune rings in its sleep without anyone touching it, one soft note that rolls through the hair we left under thresholds like a coin going bell to bell in a game no one remembers the rules of anymore.

He sends moths because he thinks libraries belong to them and because abstinence is a costume he wears poorly. They’re not real, not wing and dust; they’re the idea of erosion turned into insects. They land on the ends of shelves and breathe a faint breath that doesn’t deserve a name. Juniper claps, once, and the clap becomes a story about a teacher who made children laugh and still taught them to be quiet when the baby was sleeping. The moths forget which wall was theirs. They go where the stamp told them to, which is later, and later is a net you can sew while pretending to read.

We go upstairs, where the light turns pages with a thumb that forgives. The children’s floor is bright enough to hide sorrow in and honest enough to admit sorrow is part of the alphabet. Soot tries to lay a finger on the story hour rug. He doesn’t press; he insinuates. The rug is a map of animals. He wants them to lie down and stop looking at children with the faces of friends. Ms. Ledger arrives before me because she knows the hour by heart. She puts her fingers on the lion’s eye and says, “Not today,” in a voice that would make a river stop taking itself seriously long enough to notice the fish. I lay hair along the border of the rug, not in a way that would make a parent point and scold, but in a way that would make a child step on it because it looks a little like a road. Hair has learned manners. It holds the hush out at the door and makes it take off its shoes.

At AAMLO, where history keeps its back very straight and asks for names without apology, the hush tried to wrap a banner around the building and call it wind. The gold letters over the door, which have seen more shoulders than any parade, blinked without blinking. Page wrote headlines into the shine when no one was looking and the letters remember even if Page pretends not to. Juniper laced moss into the cracks like grandmothers sewing grief into quilts, and the weight we had strung along the seam under the street pulled memory toward itself with the gravity of casseroles. The hush bowed because it was taught to, not because it meant it, and then decided to be offended because we noticed.

He goes for the between-places next: the elevators and escalators, the little rides we make for ourselves because stairs are honest and we are lazy and both truths are fine. At City Center, the escalator hums in a language I know and pretends to be embarrassed about being in public in its underwear. He puts his palm on the moving steps not to stop them but to unlearn them. If the steps forget which is up and which is down, you get a quiet that is a heap, and heaps are his favorite furniture. I slide my fingers into the teeth without losing them because teeth know me now. I stitch a pleat into the motion, a small bias in the flow, and the steps remember that direction is a contract between desire and gravity. The elevator in the corner stops at every floor on its way down just because, which is a vice I forgive, and then arrives within the tick a man with a stroller needs. We do not talk about that miracle in any language that would make it shy.

We pause at the Fox’s sign because signs are names with jewels on and a hush that can’t learn manners near jewels will become a crime very quickly. The bulbs stutter and then stand up straight. The marquee holds onto its message as if Page himself wrote it with a mouth full of percussion. Soot leans against the letters and pretends to yawn. He’s bored because he wants triumphs, and we keep giving him nuisances. Nuisance is a strategy when your enemy is infinite; it is a religion when you are small. I press my palm to the poster for a show that has not happened yet and tell it to own itself. It does. We go on pretending to be invincible.

In the afternoon the rain decides to practice at the edge of being rain. It tastes like air that’s been in a museum and begs you to respect it anyway. The Main’s roof makes a noise like a line of people agreeing to wait as long as necessary and complaining just enough to make it fun. Ms. Ledger appears with a cart that has seen too many elephants and tells us the basement wants to talk about ducts. “He’ll travel where you can’t see him,” she says, her glasses turning strategy into an outfit. “He’ll write quiet on the backs of grills. He’ll call it ventilation and make us thank him while he steals our breath.”

We take our hair and our coins and the last of the bell-hum stitched into the seam of my sleeve and go into the guts where building and city kiss like two people who never admit it in public. The ducts are patient. They are ribs when they have to be and pipes when they have to be and always they are the rumor that keeps us from choking on our brilliance. The hush is there, a thin salt on the lip of every opening. He has learned to use maintenance as a disguise. It makes me angrier than when he tries to be a god. I come from brooms and buttons; I know what a lie looks like when it wears gloves.

Hair is perfect for this. It is domestic and cosmic and refuses to be bored. We weave a net you can’t see and shouldn’t feel, a courtesy at the door of a throat. It catches silence moths and tells them how to be dust again in a way that leaves lungs out of the argument. I rub a coin against the grill until it hums like a child trying not to sing in church and believe me when I tell you conduction can be a prayer. Juniper goes ahead on her leaf-ends like a rumor the metal wants to believe, and taps a rhythm the ducts take too seriously and then just seriously enough. The hush doesn’t fight; it sulks. It hates being made into a domestic complaint.

He drops something new because he has pride and boredom always invents. It’s not a moth. It’s a strip of absence the color of receipts you thought you’d keep and didn’t. It slides under the desk where Headlines live and pretends to be a shadow when it is a program. It tries to unspell. Not just a word. A name. The name it reaches for is mine, and the other name, and the one no one gets, and the one I learned under a bell. It’s a careful tenderness masquerading as a theft. He thinks I’ll let him because it feels like love to be handled that gently before someone takes you away.

I do not let him. The trick is not rage. The trick is paper clips. I carry them because paper clips keep revolutions from falling apart and children’s drawings from becoming sermons. I take one and open it and un-open it and lay it along the strip of absence with the calm of someone making a hairpin into a lockpick. I sew my name not into the strip but through it, into the I-beam that remembers being ore, into the air I just taught to hold a song, into the hand of Ms. Ledger who is not holding my hand and still is because we are, all of us, hands. The absence feels the weight of the ordinary and goes limp. I fold it once, twice, tuck it into the crack in the desk where pens go to hear gossip, and tell it to consider going into business as an eraser if it must be useful, but to stay away from names.

It tires him. The moths, the pleats, the bells, the coins, the hair under every threshold from here to the hills, the mylar flags we taught to flicker without becoming lightning, the courtesy he hates—you can fatigue a creature made of habit by giving it too many habits to learn. He withdraws the way fog withdraws when it remembers distance. He leaves behind a dozen little strips of quiet arranged like bookmarks and one moth that is just a moth because not everything is a metaphor all the time and we are not monsters. Ms. Ledger stamps something that does not need stamping and smiles like a person who just remembered a grandmother’s hands in a kitchen where the light had permission to be gold.

When we come up, the city has decided to practice applause without a reason. It’s First Friday again, or nearly, or never; time does that when you’re sewing it with other people’s bells. The kids at the table by the windows dissolve into a quiet that is not Soot’s and then burst into talk about a book with a dragon that looks like a bus. Kettle reads a sentence over my shoulder and under his breath and the sentence blushes. Page sticks a headline to the inside of my skull about a seam that learned to dance. Juniper wears, in every leaf-end, a humor that tastes like copper and lemons. We did not win anything. We kept the floor from remembering it wants to be a wall. Some days that is the only art in the room.

Maya is home when we get back, which is better than prayer by half. The kitchen is lit with the sun in its elder years. She has a pen behind her ear and flour on her laugh. The salmon on the counter practices the religion of becoming food. When she steps over me she says, “Fig,” with a dignity that makes the world confess it wishes it were simpler. She drops a piece by accident with intent, and this time I take it with my head very high, as if the entire history of bells had nothing to do with my ribs. She speaks to herself about a list. The list is about groceries and also about remembering to call someone back. Lists are my politics. I sit in the rectangle of light and let my hands remember every thread they’ve ever held that mattered.

At dusk we go where names live on stone and on lips and hover in the hush like birds that refused to be told not to. Evergreen calls to me not because I want to be sad but because Soot loves halls that perform respect. Juniper hates graveyards because the grass argues with her, and she goes anyway because love is sometimes a problem she solves by sharpening. The hush there is real and not his. It is born of lists and lilies and the wind practicing to be kind. He presses to see if we’ll mistake him for what already hurts. We don’t. We lay hair under the names that have been spoken properly, coins under the stones that claim someone who wasn’t claimed enough while breathing, bell-hum into the fence so the iron won’t learn arrogance. He leaves a moth on the angel’s cheek and the angel pretends not to notice because angels are vain. It is all right. This is not his room.

We go to the Paramount because organizers make contracts with applause, and Soot hates contracts that have laughter in them. The seats are velvet and old and pretend to be shy when everyone looks, then straighten as if they were made yesterday when a woman sits and takes a breath like she’s about to give herself away and the room’s job is to hold her while she does. The hush at a theater is a cousin to the one in a church and twice as fond of lipstick. He tries to flatten the clap, to turn it into a pat. He fails because the hands he’s after belong to people who filled out forms to show up. I sew thread into the aisle runners so that when two feet tap impatient and a whole room agrees to be impatient together, it becomes rhythm and not war. Juniper eats a drop of spilled champagne from last week and becomes impossible for an hour. The hush leaves to go find a hallway somewhere that doesn’t think so highly of itself.

Back at the lake, Gate grumbles because he is tired of being polite and then remembers he is old and gets over himself. The terns argue in accents and make peace in unison. Marrow arrives with a piece of balloon that says đâ and two ratlings he claims he is fostering and I pretend to believe him because his pride is a better guardian than my suspicion on nights when the moon is too clean. The hair along the tide’s throat lifts when a boat passes and settles when the wake kisses the stones. The bell hums on the far side of downtown not because anyone told it to but because it likes hearing itself in languages it did not invent. The handprint on my chest purrs. I put my palm over it and, for the first time since he touched me, feel my own heat more than his. It is not victory. It is a better ratio.

We sleep wrong, on purpose, in the place the floor insists is a rectangle and I argue is a trapezoid because it wants a little drama and I’m happy to provide it. Juniper wedges herself under my chin because she is a feral thing who learned family by accident and then pretended she knew it all along. The hum in the wires outside is back to its own key. The catalog breathes upstairs with the patience of a mother grading papers. Soot writes hush on the air outside our window and the air writes hush back and the two opinions cancel each other out, which is the only kind of politics I’m interested in at bedtime. Somewhere the seam under the hills rolls over and demands a story and Gate tells it one with a hinge and a grin. Somewhere the barber pole stops, then starts again, because pride and desire are married without anyone admitting it. Somewhere Maya turns a page and the page pleases itself. I count coins and corners and bells and hair and names and neighbors until the arithmetic becomes a song about this being this and not something else, and then I forget to count and dream that the red dot sits still long enough for me to put my face in it and kiss it and let it go.
