     "novel_text": "The morning began with an accident of light. The sun pushed through a torn cloud, finding the narrow slice of kitchen that held my mixing bowls and the jar of cardamom seeds. It made the flour on the worktop shine as if each tiny particle had a voice. My kettle coughed into life. Sale was a cold town when it wanted to be, and lately it wanted to be, but in the kitchen there was heat, and the smell of last night\u2019s bake still clung to the curtains. I had made orange-scented brioche and eaten two of them before they were even cool, and I told myself it was research, that my protagonist in the new novel\u2014stuck in a storm and haunted by the memory of a lemon tree\u2014would need to understand warm bread. He did not. I did.\n\n\u201cMarmalade,\u201d I said, as the cat pawed at the cupboard door. \u201cYou have exactly sixty minutes until I have to write.\u201d\n\nMarmalade made no promises. She was ginger and rotund and had the look of a creature who believed time was elastic and human obligations fictive. She pushed her head against my shin and let out a train whistle of a meow. The cupboard door creaked open and I fished out her tin. As she ate, I stood by the window and watched a man on the canal towpath string fairy lights along the railings of the footbridge. It was not yet December, but in Sale, winter came early in the decorations. They made the water look like a line of tiny captured moons.\n\nOn the table lay my notebook, scuffed and cracked, pages gone soft with the oil of my hands. A friend had once told me writing was mostly carpentry and patience: you cut, you sand, you leave it alone, you return. I had three short stories published in magazines no one had heard of and a novel that a small press had printed in a run so limited it felt like a dare. My mother\u2014Mo\u2014kept a copy propped in her front room as if it were stained glass. HEY, TAKE WHAT YOU CAN. She told the postman I was a novelist. She told the pharmacist I was a novelist. She told the woman at the bus stop that I was a novelist, and that I\u2019d been ignored by the big London houses because of my northern vowels. In her telling I was an avenger. In reality, here I was, in a modest terrace near the Waterside Arts Centre, making bread to steady my hands for scenes I could not yet see.\n\nMy phone hummed on the worktop. A message from Rani: remember 11 a.m. Don\u2019t be late again or I will break your thumbs. Hearts. A biscuit emoji.\n\nMy writing group met at the caf\u00e9 in the library because none of us possessed enough chairs to seat everyone. Rani ran it with the brisk charm of a nurse and the chaos of a DJ. She\u2019d had two poems in collections with forewords by people with a dozen initials after their names. She wore yellow trainers no matter the weather, and a leather jacket she called her portable bravery.\n\nI had time. On the radio a presenter spoke with reverent dread about an approaching storm that would bounce off the Pennines and turn the trams into creaking violins. I turned it down, pressed my thumb into the top of a dough ball that had been rising slowly under a tea towel. It yielded with relief. There was a good shape there. I rolled it into ropes, tied them as if I were knotting worries, and set them onto a tray. The oven sighed open. When I shut it, the glass fogged and for a second I saw my own face blurred, a stranger peering at me through winter.\n\nMo called at nine thirty-three. She had a talent for arriving in the minute in which I was most likely to make excuses to the day.\n\n\u201cSeb,\u201d she said. She called me Seb even though she had named me Sebastian and most of the world, when it bothered, went with Seb or Bash or, once, Sable. \u201cI need you to look at a tap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your plumber.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, but he\u2019s not my plumber either. He\u2019s late. They\u2019re all late. Is it in their training? Lesson three: you\u2019ll never be on time again? I can hear the tap across the road. There\u2019s a woman over there, I see her in the mornings with the dachshund. Honestly, if my tap is louder than the putter of a little dog, something is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour tap is louder than the dog? That\u2019s catastrophic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the word. Catastrophic. I\u2019ll make you a sandwich. Beetroot and Stilton. I know, I know, the colour is alarming.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always loved an alarming sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, Mr. Marmalade Brioche. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t see your little posts online.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not little,\u201d I said.\n\nShe laughed, quick and bright, a bell over the bridge. \u201cCome at eleven? Or when your group ends. I don\u2019t want to be a clich\u00e9 mother. I don\u2019t want them talking and saying, there, she is, the classic northern mother, fussing with her son.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could never be a clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo write. Go write and then come sort my catastrophe.\u201d\n\nWe rang off and I put on my scarf and the coat with missing buttons that made me look like a student. Marmalade angled her head to watch the door. \u201cDon\u2019t think about eating the dough,\u201d I warned her. \u201cIt\u2019s beneath you to be that kind of clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\nOn the Metrolink the windows were scratched with messages from men who didn\u2019t know how to leave a legacy any other way. Two schoolgirls drew diamonds on each other\u2019s hands. A man with a captain\u2019s beard dozed and missed three stops. The conductor at Dane Road made a joke about singing in the wind and only one person laughed, and I wanted to ask him if it mattered to him that it was only one person, and did he hold onto each laugh like a coin, and did it still count if someone laughed and then immediately turned to take it back with a glare. I kept my thoughts to myself and got off at the Waterside.\n\nRani was at a corner table with a notebook the size of a dinner tray. \u201cYou\u2019re on time,\u201d she said, as if my punctuality were an act of formal rebellion. \u201cHow\u2019s the baking?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter than the writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always is. You should bake a poem. Mary Berry would say\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say Mary Berry.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014that a poem needs to rise, darling, and the crumb must be\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not even that show.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat show? I\u2019m making these notes for me. I\u2019m going to pitch a TV programme called Flour Power. Do you know how many repeats there are in the day? I could be a millionaire by Tuesday.\u201d\n\nI took a sip of the coffee she slid to me that was more moral support than caffeine. \u201cI wrote six hundred words,\u201d I said, lying up.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d She knew I was lying and gave me the lie as a gift. \u201cRead it.\u201d\n\nMy six hundred words were one hundred and eighty-eight words carefully spaced and made to look like they were more by way of generous line breaks. Rani listened. She touched the margin with her index finger as if she could push the sentences deeper into themselves. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere he kneels to tie his laces and he thinks about how the world looks from the ground. That. Keep that. You\u2019re good when you\u2019re literally looking at something. No offence, but when you get out of your head, you get into the good stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always in my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe bake in your head. Use your head as an oven. What does it smell like, Seb\u2019s head? Cloves and resentment?\u201d\n\n\u201cCloves and honey,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a trace of washing powder.\u201d\n\nOur group arrived in a soft wave: Benji with his backpack full of zines; Claire with her front-of-house smile from the theatre she ran; a man called Richard who was building a poem out of the names of trains. We workshopped. We were kind and sometimes not kind in ways that taught us to be better at both. I felt the world narrow and then open and then narrow again, and in each shape there was a different version of me: baker, writer, son.\n\nAt noon I hugged Rani and told her about Mo\u2019s tap.\n\n\u201cBeetroot and Stilton,\u201d she said. \u201cTake a picture. Put it in your book.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put your shoes in my book.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone will think the character is confident.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd right.\u201d\n\nOn the towpath the fairy lights were illuminated now and useless in daylight. A toddler in a puffer coat kicked a frozen leaf as if it were an enemy. At Mo\u2019s house the front step had one of those mats that demanded you wipe your paws. She opened the door wearing an apron printed with lemons, her hair pinned up with two pencils as if she had been arrested by an urgent thought. She kissed my cheek and held my hand too long. It was her worst habit and my favourite.\n\n\u201cIn,\u201d she said, \u201cin, before we lose all the heat in this house and the bill comes through the letterbox and laughs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were always good at personifying utility companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, well. They deserve it.\u201d She led me to the kitchen where the tap did, indeed, hiss. \u201cSee? The plumber says one. He says one. He said he\u2019s on the way. I told him I would be at his house at midnight if he didn\u2019t come.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might.\u201d\n\nI crouched under the sink. The cupboard smelled of old wood and something like dill. I had no real plans for fixing anything. I opened my mouth to say, I\u2019ll call, I\u2019ll be polite, he\u2019s probably on his way, when the doorbell rang. Mo flapped her hand at me.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be him,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cor a politician. Either way I\u2019m going to make him tea and ask him if his mother\u2019s proud.\u201d\n\nThe plumber was ten years younger than me and looked as if he\u2019d replaced a tap in the womb. He bounded in and said hello to my mother as if he\u2019d known her since the bin men were respected. He bent under the sink, made the noises of someone who had seen a future written in copper pipe, and then assured us it was fixable. He had a name that might have also been the name of a soap opera character with a secret. Dean.\n\n\u201cDean,\u201d my mother said, as if testing whether it contained any extra vowels. \u201cWould you like a biscuit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said, in the way that meant he would be better with a biscuit but thought saying so would be too forward.\n\n\u201cSebastian,\u201d she said, \u201cmake Dean two cups of tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cDean,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you take sugar?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sweet enough.\u201d\n\nMo laughed. She always loved a self-mythologist. I made the tea. I thought of the oven at home with its gentle heat and of Marmalade fairy-stepping across the window ledge and knocking a bag of rye flour onto the floor. The day had become a place I wanted to be\u2014Mo at my shoulder, Dean talking in a dialect of numbers and measures. I could write this. I never wrote the worst things and I never wrote them in the present tense. Not then. Not yet.\n\nWhen Dean left, the kitchen was quiet and the tap was chastened. Mo made the promised sandwiches. There are two ways to cut a sandwich and she always did both. She laid the triangles and rectangles on a plate with the pride of an artist who had spent a restless night stitching a problem into a solution. The beetroot bled onto the bread. The Stilton glowered. We ate in silence for the first few mouthfuls, because her sandwiches demanded reverence.\n\n\u201cSeb,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you going to enter that baking thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat baking thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one from the magazine. Your Auntie Kath gave me the leaflet. She said, tell Seb. It\u2019s amateur, so you\u2019re allowed to be a semi-professional in your heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already too professional in my heart. It would be an unfair advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be daft. You make nice things and you put them on the internet and people click little hearts. You should have bigger hearts. And finally make some money. God knows your writing makes you a lot of satisfaction in the night and a lot of rent from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pay rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you heck. You slip fifty quid into my coat pocket at Christmas and call me a landlord. I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing okay, Mo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you are. I know. But why not this? Baking is not cheating on writing. You think it is. It isn\u2019t. Remember when you were little and you had that inflatable dinosaur\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTerry.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014Terry, the carnivore. You used to put him in the bath and then run into the kitchen to get a spoon and pretend you were feeding him pudding. He was an inflatable. He was full of air. But you fed him and you said, this is how he will grow. You always had more than one thing in your arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t an organised child.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were exactly yourself. Enter it. I want to be on television with an inappropriate sign. The northern mother. The clich\u00e9. I will write, I gave him the whisk.\u201d\n\nI laughed, but the thought lodged in the place where all my ill-advised ideas multiplied. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo. Do it. Think later.\u201d\n\nWe talked about other things. The old neighbour who had moved away because her son wanted her to be closer to his family and she did not want to be closer to anyone; the woman at the butcher who had started offering paprika with every order like a wizard\u2019s trick; my cousin\u2019s new baby who had a head like a potato, in the best possible way. I left with leftovers and with a scarf Mo insisted I bring because \u201cyou always underestimate the cold, as if you have a contract with the wind.\u201d\n\nAt home Marmalade had not eaten the dough but had slept on the bag of flour until her fur was dusted white. She looked at me as if she were a ghost risen from meal. I brushed her and the air was a little snowstorm. The oven had gone to sleep and needed waking with a firm hand. I baked the knots I\u2019d tied earlier. The house filled with a smell that made thinking about fiction difficult. Then, at the table, with flour on my fingers, I opened my laptop and my email chimed.\n\nAnd there it was: a subject line that looked like a dare.\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to invite you to the final.\n\nFor a second I thought it was spam, the kind that wants you to believe you\u2019ve won the lottery in a nation that uses different commas. Then I saw the logo of the magazine. Hearth & Home. Rani had mocked it as a magazine that imagined all emergencies could be solved by a well-folded throw. They ran a competition every year, the Great Northern Bake Off albeit without the rights, with a regional tour and a final filmed live for a video stream that people watched from sofas and phones as if they were catching up with a friend. I had sent in a photograph of my cardamom swirls and a recipe for my salted honey cake. I had done it after two glasses of wine and a nudge from a memory of Mo\u2019s hands on my shoulders. I had sent it and then tucked the act away in the secret drawer where I kept things I wanted to happen without the embarrassment of wanting.\n\nI clicked.\n\nDear Sebastian, \n\nWe\u2019re delighted to invite you to take part in the final of the Hearth & Home Amateur Baking Challenge. Your submission was a joy to read, and our judges were impressed by the originality of your flavours and the clarity of your method. The final will be held at the Glassworks in Castlefield on the 12th. We\u2019ll be in touch with technical details (COVID compliance etc.) and a list of ingredients we\u2019ll provide. We\u2019d love you to prepare a showstopper on the theme of \u201cNorthern Routes.\u201d \n\nPlease confirm your availability as soon as possible. \n\nAll best, \n\nShivani\nHearth & Home Events\n\nI read it twice and then a third time in which none of the words seemed to be language, just shapes spinning. The Glassworks. Castlefield. The word final hugged the page and glowed. I laughed, a sound like someone unwrapping foil slowly in a church. I stood and then sat immediately as my knees made an official complaint. \u201cMarmalade,\u201d I said. \u201cWe may be about to experience a brush with the minor leagues.\u201d\n\nShe blinked. A greenish blink, serpentine. I forwarded the email to Rani with no body and then had to send a second one with a body because what if she thought I\u2019d been hacked by a baker whose first act of malice would be to send invitations to strangers. My phone rang. Rani doesn\u2019t believe in text messages for certain categories of excitement.\n\n\u201cThis is a story,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a story with a predictable arc and yet I am thrilled. I\u2019ll be in the audience shouting when everyone else is being politely northern. I\u2019ll bring a sign that says SEB RISES.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t said yes yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay it. Say yes. Say yes on the phone to me. I will pretend to be the events manager if you need a rehearsal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and the word left my mouth and became a currency I could spend on other yeses. I typed the reply: I would be delighted to accept.\n\nI called Mo.\n\n\u201cHearth & Home,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the final.\u201d\n\nThere was a small noise. Not shock\u2014relief, I think, a distant bell confirming the hour. \u201cYou are,\u201d she said. \u201cCourse you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not allowed to heckle the judges.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll just whisper loudly. Oh, my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not ninety. I\u2019ll just be a little bit proud in the privacy of my stern face. I\u2019ll get a new coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cA coat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be on the stream, they can\u2019t see me in this old thing where the zip has ideas about my personality. Oh. Northern Routes. What does that mean? Trains? Pie?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means never say pie to anyone from Wigan unless you mean pie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father,\u201d she began, and stopped, then said, carefully, \u201cwould have been delighted.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t say his name much. Not because it hurt\u2014pain becomes furniture\u2014but because the room took on a shape when we did, and we were tired of rearranging ourselves. He had been someone who believed in work and in tools and in the idea of a day fulfilled. He\u2019d died ten years ago on a day that had looked like any day, and on bad nights I still heard the rattle of tea mugs he\u2019d put out that morning, as if there was a thin place between then and now and it could be crossed if only you knew the tune.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make him a pie,\u201d I said, which was what we said when we wanted to put something back and couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make him a pie,\u201d she said, and then, brisk again, \u201cRight. Now. Do you need me to taste? I can do it. I\u2019ll do it for England. I\u2019ll do it for Greater Manchester. I\u2019ll do it for our street.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring a prototype tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake two. We\u2019ll need a control.\u201d\n\nI hung up and pink light came through the window, a flare on the canal, the fairy lights less ridiculous now that the day frayed. I felt the strange elasticity of time when it doubles back and lets you begin again right where you are. I opened my cupboards and took stock. Flour enough to feed a parade. Sugar like quiet snow. Butter. Candied peel I\u2019d been saving for a reason that had only ever been imaginary. I opened the spice jar and the cardamom hit me with its green hush. Northern Routes. Routes, not roots. Journeys, maps, tracks. The Bridgewater Canal. The trams that slid along like careful knives. The motorway that carried us to the sea and back with chips. The recipes that had travelled in pockets and in handbags. Saffron from a market in Bury that made my fingers gold for days. FRANKS written in fading paint on a sign for a butcher who had outlived three economies. I chose a notebook page and wrote: seed cake studded with caraway and black tea soaked fruit. And beneath it: parkin reinvented, with rye and a seam of quince. And then: a braid that looks like the canal.\n\nI began to bake the way some people begin to pray\u2014not loud, not showy, but with a straightening of the back. I\u2019d thought being invited into anything would make me arrogant. It made me careful. I measured and then measured again. I thought of my body carrying a recipe that belonged to people I had known and to people I had never met. I loved, suddenly, with a childish purity, the idea that I would be judged by women in cardigans and men in jumpers who had taught themselves how to make puff pastry by watching television on a low volume so as not to wake their children.\n\nAt nine I sat down with a wedge of test parkin that was still, frankly, a bit raw in the middle. I liked it anyway. Through the wall I heard my neighbour singing along to a song that had been famous when we were young and has never been forgiven for its optimism. I opened my laptop with sticky fingers and wrote five hundred words, real words this time, words that made my narrator reach for a handrail and miss and laugh. I thought of tomorrow, of a market for quince I did not need, of Rani\u2019s sign. I went to bed with the smell of ginger in my hair and the rhythm of a recipe in my heart.\n\nIn the night I dreamed of the Glassworks, which I had never visited. I stood in a huge room with iron beams and a floor that remembered the weight of a hundred years. The judges were two women called Elsie and Mei-Lin and a man with a moustache so precise it could have been measured by a compass. My oven was a small mouth in a large wall. Mo was in the front row with a thermos. When I looked down I was wearing my father\u2019s overalls, and they fit, and I took that as a kind of blessing you only get once in a life. Someone shouted, \u201cTime,\u201d and I put down my whisk and woke, the word ringing, neither threat nor promise, just the fact of the hour.\n\nMorning came again, and I did what I always do: I made tea. I fed Marmalade. I read the email one more time to be sure I had not stitched the whole thing together from sleep. Then I went for a walk by the canal. The toe of my boot hit a stone and I nearly went in and laughed in the face of the water as if the water were a person who had told me a rude joke. A man with a hat like a collapsed cake nodded. I nodded back. My phone buzzed in my pocket and I thought of turning it off, and I knew already that this would be the shape of the coming days\u2014baking, writing, answering people, telling the truth more often than not.\n\nNo one warned me that the first yes would require a thousand tiny yeses. But then again, no one warned me that I would come to love the next half hour as if it were an object I could hold.\n\nWhen I got home, there was a package on my step. Inside: a whisk. An extravagant one. A note that read, in Mo\u2019s handwriting, Because I\u2019ll want my old one back. Don\u2019t argue with your mother. I laughed and sent her a photograph of the whisk held aloft, as if I had pulled it from a stone. She sent back a sticker of a crown. Rani texted to say I should practice under pressure and offered to ring my doorbell at random shouting, \u201cYou have thirty seconds!\u201d\n\nI stood at the kitchen table with my notebook open and my hands empty and thought, all right then, all right, come on, let\u2019s do this. The kettle popped and hissed. Someone outside started a car that did not want to be started. A child on a scooter shrieked with joy and then, abruptly, sorrow. The day arranged itself at the window like a show I was ready to watch and to interrupt and to make, somehow, my own.I did not start with the braid. I started with a list and then argued with it like a man on a bus who has just been told the timetable is a suggestion. The list wanted to be sensible. It wanted sturdy nouns, quantities with decimals, methods that would comfort a judge into thinking I had already passed. But I found myself writing things like a seam of quince as if I were planning surgery and then underlining rye until the R looked like a canal loop. Northern Routes did not want me to be tidy. It wanted me to admit that a map is a story and so is a recipe. I tore the page out and stuck it to the cupboard where Marmalade could not skate across it. I made tea as if I could boil the problem into steam.\n\nRani texted a photograph of a sheet of cardboard painted with fat letters. SEB RISES had evolved into SEB RISES OR WE RIOT and then had softened again under her brush to SEB RISES (NO PRESSURE). She had ringed the O in pressure with tiny flames as if the letter were a hob. I told her she was deranged and she sent back a gif of a woman dusting flour over a chandelier. In the group chat Benji suggested I incorporate \"found materials,\" by which he meant little square poems cut into the crust, and Claire said that would get me disqualified, and Richard replied with a line of train names that read like a psalm. I put my phone face down and took out a bowl that had belonged to Mo's mother and had a chip the shape of an ear. It made a sound when you tapped it that was neither full nor empty, and my grandmother had always said that was the point of good crockery, to teach you there is something between.\n\nI began with parkin because it felt like an exam in respect. I scalded the oatmeal and smelled the moment the treacle decided to stop being sullen and yield. Ginger went in and a measure of black pepper so tiny I pretended it was an accident even though I wanted the heat. I had quince in a bowl that the woman at the market had sold me with an apology for their bruises and a compliment for my scarf as if one cancelled out the other. I could have driven to the supermarket, but Mo had said Bury, and when Mo tells you to go somewhere, some part of you ties your laces and goes as if she is the weather. The day after the email I had walked through that market and brushed shoulders with men who had bought the same brand of socks for thirty years, and I had let my hands hover over a heap of saffron so bright it might have been illegal. The spice merchant had said the word Iran softly as if the syllables were glass and I had promised to treat the threads like royalty. I bought tea in a packet with a boat on the front and caraway seeds that got into the seams of my pocket and turned up in my change.\n\nI stewed the quince with a sliver of lemon and a tablespoon of the tea and watched the pieces soften as if the fruit had decided to be generous. The plan was to line the parkin with a thin band of quince as if it were a road cutting through moorland. I would peel the paper and the cake would show a seam like a history book, and the judges would nod at my restraint and I would pretend not to mind that it was parkin and parkin does not perform. It is a cake that keeps its counsel and improves in the dark, and it is hard to romance a judge with the promise that something will be better in three days when the whole event is calibrated to the minute. I took it out and pressed a finger to the top and it hummed and sank and rose. Marmalade leaped onto a chair and gave me the look she reserves for times when I am unfaithful to her brand of attention.\n\nAt noon Mo arrived with the air of someone who had remembered that she left the iron on and then remembered that she no longer owns an iron. She hung her new coat on the back of a chair with a flourish and moved straight to the kettle with the instinct of a woman who had not walked into a kitchen without making a drink since she was nineteen. The coat was green and had a hood that could have sheltered a family. She had pinned an enamel badge to the pocket with a tiny drawing of a tram. She held up the whisk in both hands as if she expected me to feign astonishment and then pretended to be offended when I didn't pretend. We arranged slices of experimental parkin on a plate and she said nothing for two bites and then said, in full, \"It's moody,\" and I felt absurdly proud of a square of sugar being accused of having a temperament.\n\n\"Moody is not a category on the judging sheet,\" I said, even though I hadn't seen a judging sheet and doubted such a thing existed outside my anxiety.\n\n\"It should be,\" she said. \"It's very northern to respect a food that can't be rushed and has a face like it's about to tell you a cautionary tale. This is good. It's maybe a touch wet. Do you want me to be tactful or useful?\"\n\n\"Useful, always.\"\n\n\"Then your quince seam is fat. Your ginger is handsome. Your top is dark in a way that makes me fancy it with butter and yet I know that would be blasphemy. And if you bring me a cup of tea I won't have to say anything about the fact that your oven runs hotter on the left.\"\n\nRani would have called Mo a national resource and then tried to recruit her. I made the tea and she turned the mug in her hands as if it were a little planet. We planned. The parkin would be made two days in advance and sealed as if it had secrets. The showstopper would be a braid because I could not resist a chance to tie stories into knots. I took out the saffron and let the filaments fall into warm milk and watched the liquid change its mind about the colour of itself. Rye and white flour together, cardamom and honey, a little orange zest like a borrowed sunshine. I drew an oval and turned it into a map with my pen. Three plaits for the canal and the ship canal and the river. Seeds pressed into the braids to mark the locks. A glaze of black tea and sugar to give a lacquer that would read as rain. On the side, little rolls shaped like milestones, filled with quince and caraway like you might find a handful of secrets in a pocket.\n\nMo did not say, it's too much, which is the sentence I am both afraid of and grateful for when someone loves me. She said, \"One thing at a time,\" and then she said, \"Don't overcomplicate what you can make beautiful with your hands.\"\n\nI practised without the mixer because Shivani wrote back with a list that read like a teacher's email in a year that had turned schooling inside out. They would have stand mixers but there might be electrical issues and the brief had a line about robustness. The ovens were calibrated but we were warned that one corner of the room had a draught. We would have ninety minutes alone on our showstopper after the technical challenge that we would not know until the morning. Could we bring our own spices, labelled; our own tins, as long as we didn't use them to hide a second cake; our own aprons, as long as the apron did not advertise anything except our worst habits. There would be hand gel and the cameras would be discreet in the way that anything can be discreet when it has a red light. We were to arrive with proof of a test taken at a time that made sense, and if we felt unwell we were to tell someone and be loved from a distance.\n\nI stood at the table and kneaded and told myself stories about the men and women who had kneaded before me and I let my shoulders burn until sweat ran down my spine. My father had tied ropes and loops without looking, had made a lark's head out of nothing, had once made me a little ladder out of string and explained that sometimes the ladder has to be there before you know you need it. I braided and unbraided and Muldoon from next door knocked because somehow dough has a knock, a polite thud that tells old men that young men might be doing something worth interrupting. He is not called Muldoon. His name is Mr. Halley, and he is a widow who wears a hat no matter the weather and says things like \"the nineteen eighty-six winter was a proper winter,\" but when I moved in Mo called him Muldoon for an afternoon and he has been Muldoon ever since.\n\n\"Smells like commitment,\" he said, standing on the threshold and peering around as if he might catch out my cleanliness in a lie.\n\n\"It smells like needing to practise.\"\n\n\"Same thing,\" he said. \"I used to teach lads to sit their hands. You have to learn to look at something without touching it. You look and you wait and then you know.\"\n\n\"What did you teach them to operate?\"\n\n\"Engines,\" he said, and then, \"trams. I had one boy who minded the brakes like a mother and one boy who liked to see how fast the handle would spin. You'll forgive me for thinking you are the brakes.\"\n\n\"I'll accept that,\" I said, because more often than not I am the brakes. \"Do you want to taste parkin?\"\n\n\"Does the Pope have a hat,\" he said, and then proceeded to tell me, as if I had asked, about a driver who had taken a corner too fast and had been forgiven by a city that likes to pretend it is made of right angles. He tapped the parkin with one finger and nodded and said, \"Don't cut the seam too wide,\" and then insisted that I take a painting from his hall that had belonged to his wife. It was a watercolour of the aqueduct at Barton and you could tell which way the wind was going by the way the painter had chosen to leave the paper white. I said no twice and yes once and he left with a wave that could have been a blessing or a stretch.\n\nAt the library the next day Rani staged what she called a \"controlled panic.\" She had borrowed the kitchen at the community centre by pretending she was going to host a workshop about soup, and then she had set a timer and told me I had to bake the braid from start to finish with only what I could carry in a bag. She banged on the door at intervals and shouted instructions like a benign general. Claire and Benji and Richard sat at a long table and pretended to be judges, which meant they alternated between saying things like, \"You've got twenty minutes, can we see a finish?\" and taking photographs for social media with their tongues in their cheeks. My dough rose with all the magnetism of a brick. The draught did not help. My hands, which at home had become orchestras, became forks. When the timer went and Rani did an air horn noise that echoed off the tiles, my braid was the right shape but the wrong spirit and I felt tears press my eyes in a way that reminded me of being twelve and accidentally kicking a ball into a conservatory.\n\nRani turned the oven off and turned me round by my shoulders and said, \"Look at me. We do not cry about dough in a room with a folding table. We cry about dead pets and lost loves and the time we left our book on the bus and never saw the end. We do not cry about a practice. Say it. This is a practice.\"\n\n\"This is a practice,\" I said, and the phrase was both a spell and a scolding.\n\nClaire cut into the braid and made appreciative noises like a woman who had wanted to say something far worse but had decided to let me be fragile. Richard suggested I reduce the honey by a nerve and increase the caraway, because he liked a bake that talked to him as it went down, and Benji said, \"It looks like an actual map,\" in a tone that made me believe there was at least one person in the world who would eat bread because it was shaped like a city. We made a list of adjustments and Rani offered me a napkin and then refused to give it to me until I said \"I am magnificent even when I'm under-proved,\" which I said with minimal sarcasm. We cleaned the counters because the woman who had lent Rani the key had asked her to treat the place \"as if the Queen was popping in for a bowl of stew,\" and even though there was no queen and no stew, we did what we were told.\n\nOn the evening news the storm had a name. I have never trusted storms with names because they feel like guests at a party who will arrive with a bottle of something and then announce they are moving in. The presenter stood in front of a map that had been sketched by an optimist and sounded like a man who had prepared for crisis by filling his freezer. I turned the volume down and wrote until my head felt like it had been worn smooth by a tide. In the book my protagonist finally touched the lemon tree and found it hot to the skin even in winter, and that seemed like a pretty flagrant metaphor and I let it stand because sometimes you need to be obvious to yourself.\n\nLate, the lights flickered and then went out, and the flat shifted into the kind of dark that makes you aware of the bones of your face. Marmalade, who had previously been certain the storm was beneath her, sat up and decided to confess that she was a mammal. I found candles with the air of a man rewarded for his hoarding and lit them and watched the walls become adolescent again. The dough in the bowl, midway up, sighed as if the storm had knocked on the door and told it a rude joke. I covered it with a damp tea towel and a folded jumper and improvised a proving drawer next to the radiator that had the decency to keep working. I sent Mo a message to tell her not to walk out in the dark to look at the fairy lights on the bridge and she replied with a string of emojis that looked like a small orchestra. Halley, through the wall, sang two verses of The Leaving of Liverpool and then stopped, which was more disconcerting than if he had carried on.\n\nIn the morning the storm had shoved our town into a shape we recognised and resented. Bins were in the positions bins take when they have rehearsal for a revolution. The man with the fairy lights had lost three and tied two more in a knot that I could not untangle even with my eyes. The canal was fat with attitude. I wanted to stay inside and make the kitchen a church, but Shivani had arranged a pre-final call for all the competitors, and I had decided to be the kind of person who showed up for his own life. We joined a grid of faces, nine of us, and all of us arranged our expressions into that awkward friendliness you see at a party where someone promised you there would be snacks and then lied. There was a woman in a purple cardigan with a plate of jam tarts on a chair behind her, and a man in a vest I could not forgive who told us he was a beekeeper three times. There were two young men who shared a screen and elbowed each other like brothers or lovers and laughed whenever anyone said the word \"laminate,\" and a woman about my age with an apron printed with hot air balloons and a care in her face that made me want to be on her team.\n\n\"Welcome,\" Shivani said, as if she had just arrived in our houses with a basket. She talked us through the timings and the choreography and reassured us that the judges would not, in fact, be looking for blood. She told us there would be a camera that stayed with each of us quietly, and that if we felt it breathing, to tell it to mind its business. She told us that the theme meant what we made it mean, and that she had seen past winners be as literal as gravy and as fanciful as night. The purple cardigan woman asked if we could bring our own jam, and the beekeeping vest man asked if he could garnish his bake with edible flowers from his garden, and one of the elbowing men asked if it was okay to cry on camera, and Shivani said it was okay to be honest as long as we didn't swear. He typed a line of asterisks and everyone seemed to sigh with relief.\n\nAfter the call, the kitchen felt new, as if it had been visited by a civic inspector and found in good order. I kneaded and braided and split the loaves into lengths so I could practise the oven shuffle. I set up a fan in the corner to fake the draught and I spoke out loud because I needed to hear my own timing. Ten minutes and rotate, five minutes and brush, fifteen minutes and check a bottom with my knuckle which I would inevitably describe later as knocking on a door. I made my hands remember where everything lived without looking. I hid the honey so I wouldn't drown the loaf in a bath of apologies. I made the quince seam narrow, a ribbon instead of a road, a line of gold where the knife would find it.\n\nAt some point in the afternoon I caught sight of myself in the kettle and saw my father, which was unfair of kettles and fathers both. I had his mouth when I concentrated and the way my jaw took a stand when it decided to be good. I stood with my back to the counter and ate a slice of the second attempt and tried to decide whether the parkin liked me. Bread is forgiving. It wants to be eaten. Parkin wants to be left alone until it forgives you for making it. I wrapped it in paper and slid it under a shelf as if I were tucking a child under a bed and told it a story about the time a baker had once sold out of buns in a little market and gone home and cried because he didn't know how to be as good as people needed him to be.\n\nIn the evening, Mo brought stew because she said storms are an excuse to be nineteenth-century, and we ate with our elbows on the table while Marmalade performed the long con of being a cat who likes gravy. We talked about my father and then moved him gently to the corner of the room where he always sits in our conversations, and then we let him watch us without insisting he say anything. We made a plan for the morning of the final that involved leaving too early, because Mo has a philosophy that begins and ends with being early enough to break something and fix it before anyone knows. She laid out my apron and shook her head at a stain that she said told the story of a pear cobbler and I said she was a forensic genius. She put the whisk in my bag and told me not to let Rani take it to use as a baton. She told me to sleep and to ignore any dreams involving collapsing ovens or moustaches shaped like question marks. She told me that whatever happened I had already given the world a good loaf and a moodily decent parkin and a day, and a day is not nothing.\n\nI lay in bed and did not sleep. I listened to an old podcast about sourdough as if I were revising for a test in breathing. I composed the first lines of a scene in my novel in which a man who thinks he is made of winter realises he has been summer all along, and then I laughed at myself because sometimes my earnestness is the most northern thing about me. I counted the objects I would lay out on the table in the Glassworks as if they were lucky coins: the apron, the bowl, the jar of cardamom, the honey in its heavy glass, the packet of saffron, the tin with the secret paper lining for the parkin, the brush that had lived a previous life as my father's paintbrush and that I had cleaned so thoroughly you could only see its past if you were an archaeologist. I considered texting Rani to tell her to cancel her sign because it would be too loud next to my heart, and I did not because I wanted someone to shout when the world went shy.\n\nMorning found me before the alarm as if it were afraid to lose me. I made tea and pretended to drink it with serenity and then remembered serenity is a theatre and I have never auditioned. I packed the bag and then unpacked it because I had not put the saffron in, and then repacked it and added a packet of raisins as if there might be a child at the venue who required a snack. I forgot my phone and went back for it. I petted Marmalade and told her she would be in charge of the perimeter while I was gone, and she turned her back in a way that made me feel both scolded and forgiven. The wind had given up and gone to bother another town. The canal was glassy and sulking. The fairy lights were still out, because it was morning. I locked the door and checked the handle twice because some days you have to make sure a boundary stays a boundary.\n\nOn the tram I recognised my own adrenalin in other people. There was a man in a suit pinching the bridge of his nose, a girl in a school blazer reading a book with her finger moving under the line, a woman in a tracksuit holding a bunch of keys like she might use them to conduct. I stood by the door and watched my reflection ripple and decided I was a person on his way to try his best. Sometimes a sentence like that is all you can bear, and sometimes it is everything. I texted Mo to tell her I had boarded and she replied with a photograph of a thermos and three mince pies arranged as if for inspection. I texted Rani to say if she brought the sign I would die and she replied that death is a small price to pay for solidarity. I watched the city open and close like a throat. I let the morning take me, and I thought about what it means to make something and then let it be seen.\n\nCastlefield was bluer than I had expected. The sky had found a hole in itself and poured. The Glassworks, when I reached it, looked like a building that had been taught to be polite. It had steel ribs and old brick and a doorway that wanted to tell you not to be silly. Outside, Shivani stood with a clipboard and a scarf that made her look like a flag, and she raised her hand and my name came out of her mouth tidy and correct. Mo walked towards me with the stride she reserves for events in which she has to pretend she is not the mother, and she managed, for three seconds, to be demure before whispering in my ear that she had given Richard from the group directions to a car park that may or may not exist. Behind her, Rani lifted the sign and then lowered it and then lifted it again as if it were a bird she was coaxing into flight. I breathed in air that smelled of wet slate and coffee and the particular electricity of people who have chosen to be in a room where they might fail gloriously. I picked up my bag. I took a step toward the door and did not think of anything except dough.Inside, the air had the charged neatness of a place that had been cleaned twice and then left to wait. The floor had a gloss that made even my boots stand to attention. Steel tables stood in two rows with enough space between them to prevent territorial wars, each one laid with a cutting board, a set of knives with their blades tucked under guards like sleeping fish, a stack of bowls in graduating sizes, and a laminated sheet with our names as if we were about to sit an exam. The ovens were built into a long wall and blinked an even red at us, a row of small, patient planets. Above them, a gangway ran the length of the room, and beyond a glass partition the audience seats stepped up in shallow tiers. Someone had thought very hard about how to make this old bone of a building feel like a church of competence.\n\nShivani ticked my name, clipped a green wristband around my arm and pointed me to my station with a smile that said she had already put out several small fires and would do it again without complaining. I found my bench near one end of the row, close enough to the corner to sense the seam in the air where warm met cold. If I leaned to the right, a draft trailed its hand along my shoulder, polite but insistent, like a friend reminding you that you have somewhere to be. I put my bag down and unpacked the things I was allowed to bring: the jar of cardamom, my small tin of saffron with its ridiculous felt lining, my own wooden spoon because sometimes you need a familiar handle, and the brush that had once painted a skirting board in our old house and now glazed bread with tea. A camera operator materialised at the edge of my vision, his lens blinking at chest height. He introduced himself as Ayo and explained he\u2019d be with me all day, and that I should pretend he was a coat stand until he spoke and revealed he was a person. He had kind eyes above his mask and a habit of rocking back on his heels as if measuring the room for a door.\n\nThe other bakers assembled like the first day of a workplace where everyone had accidentally worn their personality on their clothes. Purple Cardigan had introduced herself on the call as Hester and in person she had a face that had practised every version of patience. She nodded at me and balanced a plate of jam tarts on the edge of her station because some people travel with their proof. The beekeeper in the vest was called Alfie and he wore the kind of smile that had got him through a hundred conversations about stings. He kissed the tips of his fingers and raised them to the ceiling when he saw the bank of ovens, and I liked him even though he used the word \u201cnectar\u201d like it owed him money. The two who elbowed each other were Saj and Luke and the way they said each other\u2019s names had a decades-old bruise of affection in it. The woman with the balloon apron was Jas, shorter than she\u2019d looked on the screen, with a neat halo of hair and a way of aligning her mise en place that made me want to hand her my life and say, tidy it. We did the British shuffle of smiles over our masks and half-waves and the unspoken contract to help if someone\u2019s tray hit the floor.\n\nUp on the gangway the audience took their places at a careful distance, a scatter of coats and knitted hats and eyes. Rani slid in next to Mo with the sign folded in half like a secret that was trying not to be a secret. Mo had her thermos and two mince pies in a napkin and the green hood of the new coat tucked under her chair like a well-behaved pet. She took a photograph of me and, because she is not cruel, did not shout my name across the room, but it was on her face anyway. I waved in the small way you wave when you have already decided this is too much attention and you will manage it by pretending to be an understated sort of person until your own heart believes you.\n\nShivani stepped forward and introduced the judges, and for a brief second it was like the dream had loaned me a detail. Elsie Dacre had the straight back of a woman who refused to apologise for flour and a cardigan the colour of boiled sweets. She ran a bakery in Rochdale that had survived the fashions of three decades by treating fashion like a draft and moving the cakes away from it. Mei-Lin Patel carried her sleeves pushed up as if at any second she might reach into sugar and draw out a swan; she had a patisserie in Ancoats that people queued for even in rain that felt like revenge. The moustache belonged to Crispin Holt, a food historian from a corner of the world where food had been studied more than it had been eaten, and his tweed was so persuasive that I believed he might produce a footnote if I shook him. They took their places behind a calm wooden bench, and Shivani, who could have coaxed a confession out of a stone, told us to face the ovens and breathe.\n\n\u201cFor your technical,\u201d Mei-Lin said, the word making my stomach tilt as if we had driven too fast over a small hill, \u201cwe\u2019d like you to make twelve individual Manchester tarts. You\u2019ll find a list of ingredients and a recipe with\u2026 guidance.\u201d She let the pause sit there and smiled with her eyes. \u201cShortcrust pastry, raspberry jam, set custard, desiccated coconut on top. No banana.\u201d\n\nA ripple ran through the room that was half laughter and half grief. Hester made a small noise that might have been protest on behalf of the school canteen. Crispin leaned into his microphone like a man about to argue that the banana was a twentieth-century aberration and had no place in civilisation.\n\n\u201cTwo hours,\u201d Elsie said, which was the sort of mercy that carried a threat. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking for crisp pastry, no soggy bottoms, a custard that doesn\u2019t sulk, and a top that says you know what you\u2019re doing with coconut. Off you go.\u201d\n\nI have made custard a hundred times in my life and every time it behaves like a lover who needs reassurance. I read the recipe sheet, which gave us times as if time were a thing that belonged to everyone equally, then put it down and talked myself through a plan. Ditch the mixer; the pastry would be better by hand and faster if I trusted my fingers. Cold butter, rubbed in until it looked like it had forgotten once being a block. A light hand with the water, a rest that would have to be a gesture rather than a meditation. I weighed the flour, counted the breaths between cutting the fat and bringing the whole mess together, and tried not to think about the camera that might be turning my concentration into a story. Ayo stood back and hummed the smallest fragment of a tune, which would have annoyed me in any other kitchen and here made the world expand. We each had a drawer marked \u201cfridge\u201d that felt like a joke until it whirred into life and proved itself useful. I slid the dough in and pretended I couldn\u2019t hear the draft whispering that I ought to be doing more.\n\nBlind bake. The words would always sound counterintuitive to me, like \u201ccivil war\u201d or \u201chealthy char.\u201d I rolled the dough thinner than my nerves wanted and pressed it into the tart tins sitting like patient coins on my tray. Prick, line, beans. The oven door bit at me with its heat and I thought of the cold air I\u2019d left behind on the towpath and felt a small, ridiculous gratitude for the fact that we can make our own weather. The custard in the pan was milk and eggs and sugar and courage, and I stirred until the motion became the point and the whisk drew a figure of eight like a signature. No banana, I told myself like a mantra, no banana, and saw in the corner of my eye Alfie look as if he had been waiting his whole life to defy that instruction and then decide he did not want to be a martyr for fruit.\n\nI turned, three turns, rotated the tins, knocked a knuckle against a case to hear a sound that would tell me what to do next. The draft moved across my cheek and I moved the bowl to a warmer spot and blinked hard because steam is sometimes a substitute for tears. When the beans came out, the cases looked as they ought, which is to say both mean and promising, and I brushed them with a wash of egg to seal the deal and slid them back in for the briefest of second acts. The jam was the sort of red that tells a child a story and I spread it thin because nobody wanted a tart that looked like it had gone to war. I poured custard and the wobble gave me a sermon about humility. Hester caught my eye and made a face that said her custard had decided to remain liquid as an act of principle, and I wanted, with an ache that surprised me, to tell her she was doing fine.\n\nWe stood, briefly, fifteen of us in a room advertised as an event, and watched something set that we could not hurry. Ayo leaned in and asked me to talk through what I had done as if I had done anything except not fall apart, and I said words about ratios and instincts and my father\u2019s habit of tapping things and waiting, and Mei-Lin paused by my bench and did not say anything condemning, which was as much praise as I could cope with. The coconut snowed with a pleasing sort of greed. I lifted a tart and the custard held and the pastry stayed where it was supposed to be, brown at the edges like a sensible hedge. One of them sank, a small betrayal, and I moved it to the back of the tray, which is a ridiculous sacrifice because the judges are as familiar with that trick as they are with heat. I presented my twelve in two tidy rows like a man who knows he cannot hide his flaws and instead dares you to love them.\n\nJudging the technical meant being watched while you tried not to want to be liked and failing. We stood to one side while the three of them moved down the line, knives cutting clean little domes of judgement, and I tried not to let my eyes latch on to anyone\u2019s face for too long in case I borrowed their joy or their dread by mistake. When they reached mine, Crispin held one up to his nose and sniffed like a fox. Elsie tapped the base and nodded, just once, as if acknowledging that the earth did, indeed, rotate. Mei-Lin cut and lifted, the custard stayed conversational and she said, in a voice that could have been meant for me or for the tart, \u201cGood set.\u201d The jam was perhaps a mark too thin. The coconut was perhaps a whisper too enthusiastic. But there was no banana and we all relaxed as if a small cultural war had been avoided.\n\nWe lined up for the reveal of the technical rankings, numbers written on cards that had been slid under plates for the cameras to have their moment. The twins came first because their custard had the unflappable quality of men who have never been late to a bus, and Hester crept to third with a pastry that had a mother\u2019s genius for crispness, and I landed in fifth, which in my heart translated to, you do not embarrass the room, and also, yes, you could have gone easier on the coconut. Alfie was seventh and took it with a grin that made it impossible to be cross, and Jas, who had been quiet all morning, looked at her fourth place as if it were a secret she intended to keep to herself.\n\nShivani gave us ten minutes to reset and in that time my hands learned how to be mine again. I wiped the bench and laid out the things that would anchor the next hour and a half: the flour in its bag folded over to keep it neat; the yeast in its small jar like the good idea it could be; the milk in a jug that I warmed with a glance at the corner of the room that had decided to be winter. I checked the saffron as if it were a small creature that might make a run for it. I brushed a speck of jam from the edge of my station because I had the sense, as I often did, that leaving the wrong red in the wrong place would hex the day. Ayo leaned in and told me my mum had cried a very specific kind of cry at the end of the technical that had set off a chain reaction in three strangers, and I nodded and did not look up.\n\n\u201cFor your showstopper,\u201d Elsie said when we were called back to attention, \u201cwe want something that makes sense of our theme. Northern Routes. Sweet or savoury. Tell us a story, and make it edible.\u201d\n\nIt was like being given permission to be as sincere as I wanted. I tipped the flour into the bowl and added rye like a suggestion rather than a command. Milk warmed, saffron turned its flag, cardamom crushed under the flat of a knife and released that green-dark perfume that had become a part of my house. Honey went in and told me not to apologise with it later. The yeast woke and proved it by blooming like gossip. I mixed until the flour confessed and kneaded until the dough stopped complaining. Ninety minutes is an argument with time if you are asking it to be generous. I told myself to trust the muscle memory of my hands more than the part of my head that wanted to compose an essay. The draft tugged at my sleeves like a child and I moved the bowl under the edge of a heat lamp they\u2019d provided for exactly this kind of day. I let my palms hold the bowl like a planet and added warmth with the old, unromantic method of being alive.\n\nThey came to visit as the dough rose. Judges are not there to comfort, but Elsie\u2019s presence had the effect of someone putting a hand on your briefcase and telling you you\u2019d packed enough. I explained the braid, the three strands for the canal, the ship canal and the river, the seeds pressed in for locks, the black tea glaze for rain, the quince seam that would run the length of one plait like a road you could walk by taste. Mei-Lin asked how I would keep the quince where it belonged, and I told her about reducing it to a paste and piping it in rather than spooning it and letting it wander like a pilgrim. Crispin stroked his moustache like a pet and said something about heavy symbolism, and I let myself smile because if there is a thing I will be accused of, let it be that I tried to say something and then said it again with seeds.\n\nThe braid is a simple shape and also the most complicated. The three ropes laid out and the way the wrist learns that over-under-over is less about pattern and more about kindness. I rolled, I flattened, I piped a thin gold line down the centre of one strand and pressed the edges up to meet and hold it as if I were tucking in a child who wriggles. I worked faster than my instincts liked and slower than the clock wanted. Saj and Luke had decided on shortbreads layered into a map you could eat with rectangles for stations and I loved them for it without being able to tell them so. Hester rolled out suet dough for a roly-poly that made sense of railway halts and was sewing in dark jam like a seamstress. Alfie had made a honeycomb ring and was threading marzipan bees along a sugar road, and I prayed that his bees would not be judged for their cheer. Jas laminated pastry like someone folding a letter they were going to send without opening again, and her bench had an order that asked me to stand up straighter.\n\nThe draught took a bite at the left edge of my bench and my braid, once shaped and laid, rose politely at the far end and then sulked at the near. I tilted the tray, which felt like performing a magic trick in front of an engineer, and then I swallowed my pride and asked Ayo to ask Shivani if I could move the proof to the other side for five minutes. He went to ask and came back with a shake of his head, and I had the odd surge of gratitude for rules, because sometimes you need something to push against. I inverted a metal bowl over the fragile end and trapped a pocket of warmth that sent the dough a note. When it had swollen in a way that made the slice of me that is a child feel relief, I slid it into the oven and shut the door and told myself not to look for five minutes. A person can learn to look without touching, and then to trust without staring, and then to know without needing to narrate every act. Five minutes came, then ten, and I turned and brushed with tea and sugar until the surface shone like wet tarmac.\n\nRani held the sign up once, briefly, the letters of my name like a thing made of rope. Mo was talking to a woman with a hat pinned at an angle that suggested she had dressed for television in the sense that a person dresses for leaving the house for the first time after an illness. I could see the way Mo\u2019s mouth went when she was being fierce for someone else\u2019s sake, and I had a sudden image of her explaining the difference between patience and passivity to a stranger who had just said her daughter ought to calm down. I thought of my father without deciding to, the way you think of the anchor of a boat when you feel the boat float, and I was grateful again for the soft vulgarity of yeast.\n\nThere was a moment, as there always is, when the braid looked like it would burn on the outside before its inner self was ready to be admired. I knocked the underside and listened for the sound that is not unlike laughter. I rotated and made a small adjustment that seemed like pretending to control weather, and a seam at the junction of two strands opened in a thin smile and let the quince show. I told myself not to panic because a seam is not a wound, and I pinched gently and brushed the place with tea to glue it to itself. I reached for the caraway and pressed seeds in along a straight run as if I could convince anyone that they had always belonged there. The little milestones\u2014rolls wrapped around thumb and forefinger and filled with a smear of quince like a secret you tell a friend and not a crowd\u2014went in for their short bake and came out browned as if they had been out in the weather and liked it.\n\nTime was called by a person with a voice that knew how to land. We had thirty seconds by one count and a lifetime by another. I lifted the braid to the board I had brought that looked enough like a map to be embarrassing if the bread had not justified the theatre, and I laid the milestones along one side with gaps because I have always been suspicious of perfection. I wiped the smear of tea from the edge of the board and stepped back and only then noticed that I had not breathed properly for several minutes. Ayo made a little sound that might have been a yes or might have been a yawn and in either case felt like kindness. Saj whispered \u201cnice\u201d at a volume that would have gotten him in trouble in a library, and Hester patted her roly-poly like a cat. The room exhaled, which is always the moment when you remember the thing you forgot, and then remembered that this time you had not.\n\nJudging the showstopper is pageantry and it is also the awkward intimacy of a stranger telling you who they think you are. They began at the far end and worked towards me, and I watched Crispin\u2019s eyebrows and Elsie\u2019s hands and the tilt of Mei-Lin\u2019s head and tried to remind myself that today was not the sum of me. Alfie\u2019s bees looked ridiculous and therefore perfect, and Elsie told him his honey had been heavy-handed in the dough and he took it like a man who knows the difference between love and flattery. Jas had made a series of small laminated parcels that opened to reveal spices and fruit that told the route of her grandmother\u2019s kitchen to her own, and when she cut one the sound of the layers could have paid rent. They told her she had done a delicate thing without needing applause and she nodded like a person who saves her crying for later.\n\nWhen they reached me the braid had set into itself and the glaze had caught the light like a street after rain, which was a luck I had asked for and been given. Elsie pressed the edge and approved of the colour without saying she approved of the colour, which is to say she didn\u2019t frown. Crispin bent to read the caraway road as if it were a text and then raised his chin at me, and I spoke the sentence I had rehearsed in which I described the three strands, the locks, the glaze, the quince, the rye, and the way the canals had kept us together when the weather was ugly. He cut and the knife met a resistance that meant the crust had thought about me, and he lifted a slice and the seam of quince sat where I had asked it to sit. Mei-Lin took a piece and her eyes did a thing that I couldn\u2019t translate and I realised that sometimes you don\u2019t get to be fluent in everyone\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cThe crumb\u2019s a touch tight,\u201d she said, and she touched the dough with the tip of one finger like a pianist checking the instrument. \u201cThe draught did you no favours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt it,\u201d I said, which was both a joke and a confession.\n\n\u201cThe flavour\u2019s considered,\u201d Elsie said. \u201cRye can be a brag. Here it\u2019s a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like a metaphor,\u201d Crispin said, as if accusing me of something he couldn\u2019t decide to forgive, and then he added, \u201cbut it\u2019s not heavy. It eats better than it sounds.\u201d He put a small piece of the milestone roll in his mouth and made a face that suggested surprise. \u201cQuince and caraway,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not have said yes on paper. I\u2019m saying yes now.\u201d\n\nThey moved on and I stood very straight and told my hands not to touch my apron. The twins had made biscuits like a map you could break apart, and it was charming and the kind of clever that needs a frame, and the frame here was the word \u201cNorthern\u201d and we all felt it. Hester\u2019s roly-poly looked like a station buffet and tasted like a walk after rain. She had used suet without apology and Jam like a route. The beekeeper\u2019s ring had generous sweetness and a tilt towards summer that the judges did not entirely encourage in a room that was thinking about grit. We lined up again and the voices from above became the hush a room makes when it wants to be fair.\n\nShivani took the microphone not because she enjoyed the power but because somebody has to say the thing that makes several hearts fall and several hearts skip. She thanked the sponsors and the venue and the volunteers who had wiped things with a thoroughness that would have been comic in any other year. She told the audience that clapping had to be done without standing up, which produced a wave of half-laughter that made me love my town. She looked at Elsie, who looked at Mei-Lin, who looked at Crispin, who looked at his moustache because some men require props for courage. It was as if a chorus of birds had to agree on a tune and then decide who would sing the first line.\n\n\u201cWe have a winner,\u201d Elsie said, and the way she said it made it sound like the winner would be a cake rather than a person, which felt right. \u201cFor a bake that told a story without turning it into homework, that tasted like layers and read like a route we recognised, and that was, not to put too fine a point on it, technically sound.\u201d\n\nI glanced down the line because there is a part of me that has always looked away at the crucial moment, like a lover who doesn\u2019t want to see a flinch. Jas stood with her hands clasped, eyes on the table edge, as if she had been taught long ago not to ask a room for anything. When they said her name she looked up with the specific disbelief of someone who is used to carrying practical things and being thanked only by the absence of complaint. Saj slapped Luke\u2019s shoulder and whooped and Hester clapped the way experienced women clap when the point has been made. I clapped too, loud enough to make my palms sting because there are moments when bitterness would be simpler and you choose not to be simple.\n\nThey gave two commendations, which felt like a word designed to be pinned to a blazer. One for Hester, whose jam-to-dough ratio had made Elsie nod as if she had heard a well-argued point. One for me, for flavours that had chosen each other with deliberation, and for a concept that had not tripped me, even though it could have. I nodded and accepted the paper circle with its ribbon as if I were collecting a certificate in Year Six for citizenship, and I surprised myself by not wanting to make a joke. Alfie came over and hugged me with more shoulder than chest, which is the way men hug when they want to be kind and curated, and he told me he\u2019d had a banana in his bag like a lucky rabbit\u2019s foot and left it there out of respect, and I told him that showed character.\n\nWhen we were released back into the warm muddle of people and noise, when the cameras blinked their last blink and the ovens went dull and the list of ingredients on my bench looked like the remains of a party, I let myself sit on the edge of my station for the first time all day. Rani arrived with the sign and waved it like a flag at a funeral because she understands tone, and then she propped it against my bench and kissed my forehead with a theatricality she reserves for moments she wants me to remember later with a smile rather than with an ache. Mo approached slower, as if walking through a new room and checking the floorboards. She put her hands on either side of my face and did not speak for a minute that lasted long enough to fit in several past versions of me, and then she said, \u201cYou told them a thing and they heard you,\u201d and I realised that this, more than a ribbon, was the prize I had needed.\n\nWe wrapped the braid carefully and Mo took half for the neighbour who would later knock twice and pretend not to be moved and then be moved. I slid the parkin from its paper and cut squares as if I were cutting a deck for a trick, and I slipped two into a napkin for Elsie, who said, only partially under her breath, that people forget a cake that makes them cry on the day and remember the one that improves when they are alone. Jas and I swapped slices like children with stickers, and her pastry held a whisper of cardamom that made me want to sit and listen. Ayo told me he had never met a camera that behaved so well and I told him it was because it had spent the day near dough. Shivani pressed a hand to my arm in that way people in charge do when they have to move on to the next thing and want you to know you were part of this one. Rani took the whisk from my bag and used it as a sceptre and Mo took it back with an expression that invented a new subsection of disapproval.\n\nLater, when the room had been given back to its metal and its floor, when we had folded our aprons into ourselves and slipped out into the air that had been waiting, we stood a moment on the wet steps and watched the city breathe. The canals showed their backs in the late light and the fairy lights on the footbridge at home had been persuaded to behave. I carried my bag and my commendation and a roll of tape that had somehow made itself mine. Mo linked her arm through mine and said we would drop bread at Mr. Halley\u2019s and then go to hers and eat something that did not require judgement, and I said she had just described chips. Rani walked backwards, delivering her debrief as if I were an athlete who needed to hear he had legs, and she told me I had kept my brioches and my metaphors in line and therefore belonged to my own day. I promised to bring the sign back to her flat because even the most ambitious cardboard needs a rest.\n\nOn the tram home a boy in a red hoodie wore his medal on the outside of his coat and held his mouth in that way that means you cannot speak because your throat has decided to be brave. A woman read a paperback with cracked plastic on its cover and breathed through a laugh and then checked herself as if laughter had to be rationed. A man asked another man what stop this was and the other man said he didn\u2019t know because some days you can ride the whole line and still be between. I leaned my head against the window and felt the train make its sibilant way and thought that I had done the oddest and most ordinary thing. I had made the morning into something someone else could taste. I had looked at a map and then made it with my hands. I had said yes and found that, inside it, there were other yeses, small and mean and generous and necessary.\n\nAt Mo\u2019s, we unwrapped the remainder of the braid and ate it with butter we said we didn\u2019t need. Marmalade was affronted by the smell of other places on my coat and then forgave me when I produced a piece of parkin as if I were paying tribute to a small, furred tax collector. We put the ribbon on the mantel, where it made the other objects look as if they had been waiting for company. Mo told me the names of every person she had spoken to in the audience and what they did and what they thought and who they had loved, because she has a way of extracting biography with the gentleness of a dentist. She told me that when I stood with my head tipped to listen to the judges she had seen my father, and I told her a kettle had done the same to me, and we agreed that there are places where the past rises like steam and the trick is not to back away from it.\n\nIn bed that night, the storm having taken its grievance to the next town, I lay on my side and thought about the way the knife had gone through the braid and the way Mei-Lin had pinched the crumb and the way my hands had found their proof without a gadget. The book called to me, a polite cough from the corner, and I wrote with the duvet over my legs and the cat in her doughnut shape at my feet. My protagonist stood at the lemon tree and did not touch it this time. He turned away and walked along a canal that did not belong to his childhood and watched the water carry a sheen like tea across its back. He passed a boy wearing a medal. He saw a woman holding a whisk as if it were a torch. He kept going, and I kept him company, and the night went with us until it became morning again and the sun put its hand through a torn cloud and found the exact place where flour had been.The morning after smelled of last night\u2019s sugar and something like relief. My phone had become a small festival, banners unfurling in the form of notifications from friends of friends and strangers with usernames that offered me cake in exchange for stories. Rani had sent a link with a timestamp to the moment she had lifted the sign and then put it down again and then lifted it with amended bravado, and her message was the sort of exultant that always finds the single hinge in me that needs oil. Mo had written, Make sure you eat a decent breakfast and not just glory, and then, half an hour later, What is glory when you slice it. Marmalade sat on the back of the sofa as if she were supervising a staff of invisible interns and blinked at me with patience that was not patience at all but the knowledge that I would come to my senses and open a tin.\n\nI made tea with the solemnity of a newly sworn juror and watched the stream again until the parts of my body that had been braced eased down into something like ordinary. The braid looked like a thing I had done on purpose and not a thing that had let me do it, which felt like a generous trick of the camera. The comments were primarily people arguing about whether a cake could be moody and someone asking where they could buy quince in Barnsley, and one person saying that you could tell I was a northerner by the way I held my bowl as if it were something that might leave if not loved. I laughed and then felt the warm flush of being seen in a way you do not want to admit you enjoyed.\n\nBy ten the doorbell had received three polite misuses. Mr. Halley knocked once, pretended to carry on down the road, knocked again and then stepped back as if worried I would think him needy. He wore a scarf the colour of pennies and smelled faintly of something medicinal that had been fashionable when buses were orange. I handed him half the braid wrapped in paper like a letter and he held it against his chest in a gesture that made my throat do the nonsense thing. He didn\u2019t talk about the programme or the commendation ribbon that Mo had propped near her clock, because he is the kind of man who thinks fuss should be kept for emergencies and births, but he put his hand on my shoulder with a weight that said he had watched the whole thing and had done some muttering on my behalf.\n\n\u201cI watched a bit,\u201d he said, which in Mr. Halley\u2019s lexicon is a confession of obsession. \u201cYou were neat. That\u2019s half of it. Neat keeps parts from flying off when you change speed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a draught,\u201d I said, because it felt right to blame weather in front of a man who had coaxed vehicles through every version of it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a draught,\u201d he said. \u201cBuildings breathe because people forget to. You did your little bowl trick. Smart. Bridget used to say the aqueduct at Barton taught her that water holds its shape if you ask nicely and build the walls. You can\u2019t stop the wind. You can build your edges.\u201d\n\nHe nodded towards the painting he had given me and I followed the line of his finger to the pale wash where the artist had left the page clean. The white there had a kind of courage. He told me a story about a driver who had memorised the way the wind came off the river at particular bends and had learned to ride it rather than correct it, and he ended, as he often did, with a joke so understated it felt like a proverb. When he left, I stood for a moment with the door shut and held the quiet like a parcel.\n\nShivani\u2019s email slipped into my inbox with the modesty of a librarian closing a window. She thanked us for the day and for not swearing and for being the kind of people who could be told a rule and obey it without being told twice. Then, at the end, there was a paragraph that was both an invitation and a dare. Would I consider writing a small piece for the next issue of Hearth & Home, about the experience of making a route out of flour. The column would sit in a section that used to be called From the Hearth and had been renamed The Long Table by someone in marketing who had not wanted to look the word hearth in the face. It would be part recipe, part reflection, with a photograph if I could persuade a friend to take one in which I did not look like I was apologising for my jug. They could pay me, not extravagantly, but in a way that meant I could buy saffron without bargaining with my conscience.\n\nI did not say yes immediately, because I am a man who sometimes likes to pretend that deliberation is integrity. I read the email twice and then did the thing I always do when the day arrives with an extra coat and I\u2019m not sure how to carry it; I went to the library. The air in there had a civic rectangularity that calmed me. The woman at the desk wore a cardigan that could have solved a small disagreement just by draping it over the participants, and the WHISPER PLEASE sign had been handwritten by someone who loved their own hand. Rani was already at a table, a polka-dot scarf looped twice around her neck like punctuation. She had two coffees and a packet of biscuits that had been on offer in a way that made them taste like victory.\n\n\u201cBefore you say anything, yes,\u201d she said, when I slid into the chair and put my bag down as if it contained a very small, very loud animal. \u201cYes to whatever. Yes to writing it. Yes to pretending you ate only one mince pie yesterday. Yes to getting a decent author photograph where you are not holding a whisk like an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want a recipe with it,\u201d I said, trying to sound hapless and failing. \u201cHalf story, half method.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour whole life is half story, half method. You were literally born to do this. You came out with a list and a metaphor and a small complaint about the lighting.\u201d She leaned in, doing the Rani thing where she made the ridiculous feel like plain sense. \u201cWrite about your dad. Not in a tragic violin way. In a rope-and-knot way. Write about the seam and the locks and you standing there thinking you\u2019re in charge and the canal laughing behind your back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t write my dad into every good thing,\u201d I said, even as I knew I would. \u201cHe\u2019ll get tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll cope,\u201d she said. \u201cMen who put mugs out in the morning can take a little literary wear-and-tear.\u201d\n\nWe worked quietly, as far as Rani works quietly, which is to say she hummed and wrote aggressively and every so often looked up and said, out of nowhere, \u201cYou could call it A Narrow Cut,\u201d and then wrote the words down on her own paper and boxed them twice. I wrote the first lines of the column with my fingers sticky from biscuit crumbs and found that the tone, which had worried me, arrived on its own feet. It wasn\u2019t the voice of my narrator, who was currently sulking in a lemon grove and refusing to turn towards his own plot, and it wasn\u2019t the voice I used when I tried to be authoritative, which always sounded like I\u2019d been given a megaphone by accident. It was the voice I used when I told Mo a story of a small thing becoming large, and when I told Marmalade that the tin would open, and when I told the dough to wait for me. It was relief to find a register that did not ask me to choose between sincerity and wit, because lately everything had felt like a test I had not prepared for.\n\nAt noon a school party invaded, a flock of small coats and bigger questions, and the librarian materialised a courage the size of a bus and persuaded them to enjoy quiet as an activity. One of them broke from the group like a comet and came to our table and looked at my notebook and asked, without preamble, \u201cDo you like cake?\u201d I said yes because I am a citizen, and he told me that his uncle had once hidden a ring inside a fairy cake, and the woman had nearly swallowed it and then said maybe that was a sign. I said that putting jewellery in food was a gamble and his eyes lit with the knowledge that he had discovered a new way to annoy an adult. As they left Rani whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a workshop on Thursday,\u201d and by the time I had said \u201cam I\u201d she was texting someone a confirmation and adding, Teacher discount if we bring our own flour.\n\nI took the long way home, past the theatre where Claire had convinced a city councillor that an open day counted as outreach even if there was a bar, past the barber with the window plants that looked perpetually surprised to be alive, past the butcher with his new habit of proffering paprika with a seriousness that implied penicillin. When I crossed the footbridge a man was untangling the fairy lights and swearing with the delicacy of a person who had been brought up near clergy. He glanced at me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the bread,\u201d in a way that made me want to point behind me to a man carrying six baguettes and pretend I had been mistaken for someone else. Instead I said, \u201cI had a bread,\u201d which is not grammar but is accurate enough for a towpath. He asked if my mother was the woman who had cried beautifully, and I said yes, and he said he would be asking her to stand for the council and I said he wouldn\u2019t be disappointed in her principles.\n\nAt home, the flat had done that thing home does when you\u2019ve been seen by other people\u2019s eyes; it had become truer in order to reassure me. Marmalade demanded reparations for my absence and then forgave me in exchange for a spoon rinsed under hot water as if I had invented the concept of rivers. I stood at the sink and typed a polite yes to Shivani, added a line about liking deadlines that assumed the shape of a lie, and asked when she\u2019d need it. She wrote back with the velocity of someone who knew how to make a day move: end of the week, two photographs, keep it under a thousand words because nobody wants to scroll forever while holding a cup of tea.\n\nMo arrived without knocking because I had given her that permission years ago and would not take it back even though she abused it beautifully. She carried a tote bag with a hedgehog printed on it that insisted we were in this together, and in it were three apples, a newspaper folded into a kind of swan, and my old scarf that I hadn\u2019t seen since last winter. She put the apples in the bowl and the scarf around my neck and sat down as if the chair had been expecting a sermon. She had watched the stream twice more and had notes, which is the way her pride makes itself useful. She told me my left hand had done a small wobble after Crispin had said the word heavy, and she had written in the margin of her mind, Do not take it in. She told me that Jas had handled her pastry as if it were a breath and had therefore deserved to win, and she told me that the man in the third row with the velvet collar had sneezed silently and she had admired him for that.\n\n\u201cShivani wants a column,\u201d I said, and Mo smiled in a way that made the kitchen warmer.\n\n\u201cOf course she does,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cDon\u2019t be clever in the first paragraph. Be clean. Put your father in when people are already with you. Make them taste the quince before you tell them why you use it. Don\u2019t talk about roots unless you\u2019re going to talk about boots. People like the sound, but they prefer the heel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been writing behind my back,\u201d I said, and she shrugged in the direction of the window.\n\n\u201cYou put fancy words in your pocket and forget to check them when you do the washing. I fish them out and make soup.\u201d She pulled a notebook from her bag and I caught a glimpse of a page on which she had written, in her crabby open palm, Marmalade should have a say, and below it, Not cute. Wise. I put my hand over my face and she laughed and tapped my knee twice.\n\nThe workshop on Thursday was in a classroom with walls that had been painted with slogans by people who had never been shouted at by a slogan. Rani introduced me as a writer and then as a baker and then as a person who could make an egg do what it was told and a metaphor behave, and thirty children looked at me in the way children look at adults who claim to be good at anything. We made buns and called them cobs and then had a friendly argument about the correct word. Flour flicked through the air like an argument between angels. A boy with a serious fringe told me that bees die if they sting you and wasps don\u2019t, which is why wasps are confident, and I considered that this explained many human men I had met. A girl drew a diagram of her route to school on the back of the recipe and coloured the paving stones according to whether they were lucky, and when I asked her how she knew a lucky paving stone when she saw one she said it made her shoe nicer. I read them the part of my book where the man thinks he\u2019s made of winter and half of them rolled their eyes and the other half asked if winter had a colour, and I left the room with flour in my hair and the sense that my yes had purchased me something I couldn\u2019t list on a bank statement.\n\nAt the end of the day, washing mixing bowls in the tiny sink of a classroom that had once been a cupboard, I received a message from Alfie with a photograph of his bees looking like small, irritable gods. He had watched the stream again and wanted to give me a jar of the honey he used when he wasn\u2019t performing for men with moustaches. We arranged to meet at the market on Saturday and he added, unbidden, that he had an aunt in Urmston who made parkin that scared him and that he would bring it if I promised to be kind. I told him I would be afraid of it on his behalf and he sent back a row of laughing faces and then a picture of a single bee with the caption, She is a nightmare and I adore her, which made me hope the women in his life were well defended.\n\nOn Friday I went to Bury with Mo because she said she hadn\u2019t walked the market in rain for a while and her body had that itch it gets when it needs to be among stalls. We moved through the hall with our shoulders squared and our hands respectful. The fishmonger flirted with Mo in the way men flirt with women they would like as captains, and the spice merchant nodded at me like a co-conspirator and slipped an extra pinch of saffron into my packet with the gravity of a man who has done something irregular. I bought caraway by the fistful because I had given too much of it away in the last week when people asked me what the flavour was and I wanted them to have it in their hands, and Mo bought a small tin shaped like a bus for a child she did not yet know because she is always preparing for visitors. At a stall selling second-hand books I found a slim volume of Lancashire dialect that had been annotated in pencil by someone both pedantic and tender, and on the train back I made Mo listen to me say, \u201cHappen\u201d and \u201cNowt\u201d as if I had discovered them and she had been using them uncredited for sixty years.\n\nI wrote the column on Saturday morning and sent it on Saturday afternoon because if I had kept it until Sunday it would have become an enemy. I kept it under the word count because I wanted to be the sort of person who could keep their own flour under control. I wrote about the draught and my father\u2019s ladder made of string and the way quince keeps its shape if you coax it, and I did not write about the moment in the room when I had felt my fingers forget themselves because that was for me. Shivani wrote back before tea to say that it had made Elsie put the kettle on and that Mei-Lin had asked if I would please not encourage the entire north of England to pipe quince into bread because she did not have enough counter space for a revolution. The photographer would come on Tuesday and would insist I stand near a window and pretend not to be posed, and could I please iron something even if my mother had ideas about the corruption of irons.\n\nSaturday evening Rani arrived with a rolled-up poster tube and the kind of cake that can only happen when someone has bought more lemons than is reasonable. She unrolled the tube and the sign fell out and made a little thump on my rug, the letters cracking at the edges in a way I found endearing. We ate cake with spoons because we could not find a knife that did not smell faintly of garlic and we talked about the library\u2019s chair situation. There are never enough chairs, she said, and people are always pretending to be okay with three people to a stool. She had been told that the council might fund four more if we could demonstrate usage and she had an idea she wanted me to hate. A bake sale, but not cute. A bake sale in which each item came with three lines from a story and you had to assemble a page by buying three buns. I told her this was a pyramid scheme in sensible shoes and she accused me of being afraid of fun. We scheduled it for the end of the month and she made me promise to invent something for people who didn\u2019t eat butter, which she pronounced with comic sorrow like a priest intoning a necessary sacrifice.\n\nJas came on Sunday afternoon with a box tied with butcher\u2019s string and cheeks that suggested she had been both praised and scolded by the week. We had exchanged numbers in the kind way people exchange numbers when they have stood under the same light and want to keep that permission alive. She carried herself like someone who had spent years in rooms learning how to hold her tools and her face, and in my kitchen she relaxed two degrees as if the particular clutter told her who I was. She gave me a tart like a folded letter and I made coffee so carefully you\u2019d think it had a camera on it and we sat on opposite sides of the table like a pair of detectives comparing notes.\n\n\u201cI liked your seam,\u201d she said, in a tone that might have sounded arch if anyone else had used it. \u201cIt was a risk. You made it behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did a little pinch,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen the draught got ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have a draught,\u201d she said. \u201cMine is men in hats.\u201d She told me she had gone home after the final and baked biscuits that had ingredients and anger, and then she had taken the anger out and left the ingredients and had sent the biscuits to her neighbour who watered her herbs when she forgot to water her own life. She asked me if I had ever laminated pastry and I told her no because I like my sanity, and she laughed without sound and described the tiny courage it takes to leave butter where it is, and how the layers will teach you if you let them. We traded half-recipes as if we were smugglers and promised to meet again and not talk about moustaches or men with clipboards for a whole hour.\n\nThe week folded itself into a routine that felt almost like a ritual. Morning with tea and Marmalade and a paragraph of my own, then dough, then words that belonged to someone else, then a walk by the water to apologize to my back for the kneading, then returning emails with the briskness of a clerk who likes his stamp. People wrote to tell me their fathers had put mugs out in the morning, and people wrote to argue about desiccated coconut, and people asked me for the quince recipe and then wrote again to tell me they had used apples because quince hadn\u2019t turned up in the shop and could I promise that the result still counted. I said yes because I am not the kind of man who tells a woman from Romiley her cake doesn\u2019t count. The photographer came and made me stand in the doorway and laugh with my mouth closed and then he took fifty pictures of my hands as if they had done the flour all by themselves. He told me his girlfriend had learned to make banana bread during the first lockdown and then unlearned it during the second, and that sometimes her standing at the oven waiting for something to rise had been the only proof he needed that days existed.\n\nMo decided that her contribution to the bake sale would be a tray of something that could stop a door if necessary. She rifled through her copy of Bero with a nostalgia so sharp I could have leaned on it and got a splinter. In the end she chose tiffin because it sits there looking unassuming and then makes you glad in a way you didn\u2019t prepare for, and because it allowed her to say the word digestive without blushing. We made it late at night in our socks, crushing biscuits with the ends of rolling pins and feeling like vandals, and when the chocolate set we cut neat squares and tried not to eat more than three in the name of quality control.\n\nOn Thursday the town discovered a hole in its pavement near the co-op and this gave everyone something to talk about that was not hard news. Men gathered around it with the solemnity of midwives, hands on hips, heads tipped to consider the hole\u2019s personality. A woman in a high-vis vest poked it with a rod as if she were interrogating it kindly. The hole had the arrogance of a young starlet. I watched for ten minutes and then tore myself away and went to the canal where the man with the fairy lights had tamed them and was sitting on the railing like a boy. He told me his mother used to work in the offices at the Glassworks when it was a place for making things that sang and that he had a photograph somewhere of her in a dress that believed in itself. I told him my mother had received a whisk from herself and he said that was exactly the sort of woman he\u2019d be willing to follow into a bureaucracy.\n\nThe evening before the bake sale the group met at the caf\u00e9 in the library with a purposeful abundance of Tupperware. Benji had made something vegan that smelled like a new kind of science and tasted like a triumph, and Claire had produced small pies that might have been illegal in more than one country for being both generous and unobvious. Richard had created a tray bake cut into pieces named for lines that only trains and hymn writers remember, and each had a little label written in a script so careful it made me feel like I hadn\u2019t loved my own writing enough. Rani moved among us with a clipboard and a borrowed authority and told us that if we made the schoolchildren pay more than a pound for a bun she would put us in her notebook under My Little Tyrants.\n\nAt the sale itself the room filled with the hum of people behaving better than they needed to. Children stuck three strips of story to a page and then traded them like football cards and shouted when they found a sentence that matched their friend\u2019s. An old man asked me for a piece of parkin and then told me, as if I had been planning to disagree, that parkin is not for the day, it is for the week, and I agreed and wrapped it and told him to put it in a tin under his stairs. A woman bought two buns and then asked me to sign the paper they were on as if my name would improve the crumb, and when I looked up she was already crying, which is a hazard in a town where emotion is often stored up accidentally and then spilled in front of a man selling his wares. We made enough money for six chairs because Claire had made eyes at a councillor and Richard had sold his railway squares as history and Rani had put out a jar that said NO PRESSURE and the jar had worked like a spell.\n\nAround nine, home with only the corners of the day left, I took out the bowl with the predictable weight and sifted flour into it with the satisfaction that comes from knowing what happens next. Through the wall Mr. Halley sang a full song without stopping and I leaned my head against the cabinet and smiled because the rhythm was the one he used when he sanded a bannister or told a story about the nineteen eighty-six winter. My phone buzzed and I dried my hands, leaving a print like a fossil on the towel. Shivani had sent the proof of the column with a note that said the copy editor had put a comma in a place that did not deserve it, and did I mind if they kept my uncapitalised north because it felt like a choice. I said yes because I liked the way she had asked, and then she sent me the photograph that would go with the piece and I said, unexpectedly and out loud, \u201cAll right,\u201d because the man in the doorway did not look apologetic; he looked like someone who would put flour in his hair on purpose.\n\nIn bed, the cat finding the hollow at the back of my knees with a precision that would have impressed a cartographer, I took up my notebook and wrote a page that belonged to a man by a lemon tree and a tram line at once. He took the lemon and put it in his pocket for later and walked to the water and watched a boy on a scooter and a woman carry a whisk like a baton and an old man claim a hole in the ground as if it were a story. He kept moving because movement had become the magic, and over him, I let the sentence I do not yet know how to make elegant stand in its ordinary clothes. Yes, I wrote, and yes again, and yes in the small letters that mean I am not being grand, I am only agreeing to be here with my hands.\n\nI woke at four to the sound of rain being rude and lay there with the catalogue of the week on a little carousel, and then I got up and padded to the kitchen because sometimes lying still feels like a kind of piracy. The dough had done its slow thing and when I pressed my finger into it the dent filled in like forgiveness. I knocked it back and it sighed and I thought, briefly and without embarrassment, of my father\u2019s hands. I braided for nobody, and the cat watched me with the sort of disdain that is a compliment if you squint, and the flat filled with the smell of staying. When I cut into the loaf it clicked in that way that tells you the air did not have its way with you, and I ate a slice standing up and thought that some mornings you don\u2019t need rhetoric, you need butter. Outside, the fairy lights on the bridge shone the way they always meant to, not as an announcement but as a proof, and I stood at the window, and I let the day arrive without telling it what it owed me.The column went live on a Wednesday that had the decency to be grey in a way that made screens feel like fires rather than traps. Shivani sent the link at eight with the brisk little bracket of an emoji that suggested she had already put out two small editorial blazes before breakfast and was ready to put out mine if I panicked. I read it once and then again and then did the ridiculous thing of pretending I was a stranger who had stumbled upon it and needed persuading that quince belonged in bread. It looked like me without the jitters, the photograph catching a moment in which I appeared to know what to do with my hands, a trick of light and posture that any mother would claim as genetic. People found it. They sent messages that were stories disguised as congratulations, paragraphs about the way their grandad crushed cardamom with a hammer and how their aunt smuggled saffron home in a Bible because she trusted God and border guards equally. Someone sent a picture of a loaf with a seam so generous it might have been a motorway, and I wrote back suggesting the B-road approach, which felt like the sort of sentence you only get to write after you have said a large yes in public. Mo read it on her phone with her glasses low and then on her laptop with her glasses high and then printed it and put it under a magnet on the fridge that has been shaped like a tomato for as long as I\u2019ve known what a fridge is, as if paper required the comfort of fruit.\n\nShe rang after nine as if she had waited five honourable minutes to call and could not have waited six without exploding into advice. She said three women in the post office had told her they felt seen by the bit about draughts, and one had admitted to using a hairdryer on her dough when the kitchen lost its nerve, and Mo had updated the woman\u2019s opinion of herself just by saying, \u201cI\u2019d do the same,\u201d in a tone that gave the act a cape. \u201cWe should go and look at some actual citrus,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019re determined to make your poor fictional man stand under a lemon tree for the rest of our days. We could go to that garden, the big new one with pathways sensible enough for me to complain about anyway. We\u2019ll agree with ourselves about the smell and then you\u2019ll stop writing about it like it\u2019s a ghost who borrowed a bar of soap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you mean the one near Worsley,\u201d I said. \u201cRHS. They have a glasshouse the size of a confidence trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d she said. \u201cBring your notebook. Bring me a scarf. I\u2019ll bring the thermos. We can have a sit and pretend the world is Mediterranean until the sky tells us not to be silly.\u201d\n\nWe went in coats that had taken a position on hoods. The bus to the garden moved through Salford with the sort of patience that thinks it might be contagious, and Mo narrated the route with details you don\u2019t get from an app. She pointed at a terrace and said a woman there had once had a canary that sang along to the radio and then refused to sing when the DJ changed jobs; she indicated a corner shop and declared it the best place for funeral lilies because the man had learned gentleness with his hands from a mother who took in sewing. At the entrance she bossed the map as if a path might try to give her the slip, and then, when we found the glasshouse, she let her sensible stride slow as if heat taught behaviour.\n\nInside it was a separate hour. The air held the kind of sweetness that made your shoulders loosen and your past step aside. Leaves had the gloss that suggests money and good habits. The lemon trees, which I had expected to behave like caricatures of themselves, stood with their small green fists unclenching, their fruit the colour of warnings dressed up as favours. A volunteer in a fleece with the garden\u2019s crest explained very gently to a man in a waterproof that this was not the kind of place you took cuttings, and the man in the waterproof looked as if he had been accused of theft and then forgiven for it on the same breath. I stood with my notebook open and did the thing Rani teased me for, which is to look a scent in the face and ask it questions. The lemon wasn\u2019t furniture polish, though that memory elbowed its way into the room with its jaunty deceptive shine; it was pith and oil, bitterness and promise, the sort of sting that tells you a wound is clean.\n\n\u201cYour father would have hated this,\u201d Mo said, not unkindly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like a plant under glass. He said it made them complacent. But he\u2019d have liked the piping. Look at those hoses, tidy as soldiers. He\u2019d have run his hand along that line and found the place it squeaked.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always found the bit that squeaked,\u201d I said, and because the ghost of furniture polish had invited the workshop in, I saw him at his bench in the old house, the one before we had central heating and after we had stopped pretending we could fix everything ourselves. He would temper varnish like a man bringing a child round from a tantrum, put a glove on and sand as if smoothing a word. He would stand without putting weight on one hip as if he didn\u2019t trust his own balance, and he would tie a length of cord into a bowline while talking about Mondays as if the knot and the day were the same kind of problem.\n\nWe sat on a bench and watched a child point at oranges with the seriousness of a scholar. Mo poured tea into the thermos lids and passed me a biscuit she had put in for the sake of the ritual even though she refused to admit that tea tastes wrong without something that crunches. \u201cYou could put your man in here,\u201d she said. \u201cHe could stand under the lemon and realise he has been waiting for a different tree all along. Or he could end up working here because you\u2019ve given him too much weather and not enough occupation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make him sound unemployed and easily led,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201che lives in your head. I\u2019m only reporting conditions.\u201d\n\nOn the way out my phone did its small tap. There was an email from a person called Caro whose surname had an abundance of consonants that made me think of law firms and expensive moisturiser. She had read the column \u201cwith enormous pleasure\u201d and had then \u201cpopped over\u201d to my website, which was generous given that my website was essentially a friendly apology with some pictures of bread. She loved the \u201cintersection of narrative and kitchen,\u201d a phrase that made me see a zebra crossing over a chopping board, and wondered whether I had ever considered \u201ca book that explores routes in this way, a memoir with recipes, a map of the north through bakes and the stories that carried them.\u201d There was a calendly link, a word I mistrusted, and three suggested times to chat that week, one of which did not require me to either get up at five or pretend to be a man who used the word brunch like a verb.\n\nI showed Mo the email and she took my phone with the sort of reverence she reserves for photographs of babies and new buildings. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, and then \u201coh,\u201d again, and then, quietly, as if the lemon trees might be listening for gossip, \u201cDon\u2019t let them make you into something you can never stop being without disappointing them. But also, don\u2019t be daft. Say yes and see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be a person who writes only about bread,\u201d I said, aware I was speaking about both pride and fear.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t a person who writes only about anything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou write about hands. You write about waiting. You write about the way people look at one another when they\u2019re not sure what to say. If she wants to let you do that and buy you some flour along the way, then we will call that a win. And I will order five copies and make Auntie Kath rearrange her mantel.\u201d\n\nWe booked a conversation for Friday at eleven, which felt like a time that would allow me to be both articulate and suitably northern. On Thursday Jas messaged to ask if I wanted to come by the patisserie at dawn and see lamination performed by someone whose pastry did not sulk. Dawn and I are not, as a rule, intimate, but I said yes because sometimes your hands need to be humbled and sometimes you need to admire competence up close. I set the alarm for a time that felt like an insult and woke half an hour earlier with the knowledge that Marmalade would take my wakefulness as a personal triumph. She supervised my dressing from the bed, ears pricked, tail scrolling as if she were writing an email of complaint in cursive.\n\nJas\u2019s place at six in the morning was a chapel that had cracked its knuckles. The steel surfaces had the gleam of a surgery and the bins were lined like a row of school children with their shirts tucked in. She placed a slab of butter on the dough with the generosity of a host and then pressed the whole thing with a rolling pin the length of an oar. \u201cThe trick,\u201d she said, \u201cis to accept that most of the action is waiting. You need to tell the butter where it\u2019s going to school and then let it have holidays. Fold, chill, fold, chill. The mistake is thinking you can persuade it with force. The second mistake is pretending the room is not part of the recipe.\u201d\n\nShe pushed and turned and breathed through her nose with the steadiness of a swimmer who trusts her tide. I tried, and my butter told me I was an amateur using my kindness like a blunt instrument. I rolled too hard, then too soft, then apologised to the bench out loud and Jas laughed and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of swearing you can do without swearing,\u201d and I took that as permission to mutter into the dough as if it had personally betrayed me. She made a thousand layers look like something a patient would request for convalescence. We talked in the in-betweens with the shorthand of people who don\u2019t need to set the scene. She told me about her grandmother\u2019s kitchen and the way the men were expected to leave the room after they had eaten because women required space to speak and knead both, and I told her about a boys\u2019 school cookery class in which the teacher had confiscated three wooden spoons for pretending to be drumsticks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hate it if you get put in a box,\u201d she said, folding neatly. \u201cPeople like putting us in boxes because it makes them feel like they\u2019ve tidied. They think lamination is women\u2019s work until it gets a television slot. They think your flavours are domestic until someone with a moustache tells them they\u2019re history. Do the thing you can stand behind if the camera goes away. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nWhen I left she pressed a paper bag into my hand that turned out to contain two croissants that had survived being alive by learning to bear their own weight. I carried them home like a courier and Mo appeared at my door the way people appear when scent calls them down a corridor. We ate in silence for the first five bites because there are rules and then because Jas had achieved the kind of balance that made speech feel like a left turn with no indicator. \u201cHers,\u201d Mo said, with an authority that would have allowed her to sit on a jury for pastry. \u201cYou can tell. She\u2019s got that thin thing going on that isn\u2019t insubstantial, it\u2019s intent. She\u2019ll do fine.\u201d\n\nFriday arrived in stepped shoes. I sat at the table with my laptop open and my mug at the correct distance and the whisk watching from Mo\u2019s new place for it on the dresser as if prepared to step in. Caro came onto the screen in a rectangle that suggested daylight and money. Her bookshelf was colour-coded in a way that would have given my father thoughts and me a rash, but her face was frank and her smile lacked the sharpness that can make compliments feel like purchases. She asked after the weather in a way that wasn\u2019t filler because she\u2019d eaten rain and she knew it was a meal.\n\nWe talked. She didn\u2019t try to sell me myself, which I appreciated. She had read the piece and some of my zines I\u2019d pretended were private, and she had a softness around the eyes when she said the sentence that made my back straighten. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make you choose a lane,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see if we can draw two parallel lines that don\u2019t collide and tell a story worth walking along. The essays would be essays. They would not be instructions dressed up in anecdote. The recipes would be recipes, not metaphors that burned. You\u2019d be allowed to be funny. You\u2019d be allowed to be sad. We could call it Northern Routes and then refuse to be lazy about what that means.\u201d\n\nI said the things I\u2019d told Mo about not wanting to be trapped in a flour sack. I said the things I had said to myself about not being ready and then had the good sense to hear them back and dislike them. Caro nodded the way you nod at a child who deserves to keep their reasons and also deserves to have someone hold the door open. \u201cWrite me a page,\u201d she said. \u201cWrite me a letter from the book to itself. Three ideas for chapters. Tell me what you don\u2019t want it to sound like. Tell me where you want it to be on a shelf. Don\u2019t send me a recipe yet. Send me a mood-board in sentences. If we hate it, we\u2019ll say so and spare ourselves a year of pretending. If we like it, we\u2019ll agree to be brave and to have proper lunches when travelling is a thing again.\u201d\n\nAfter the call I did the washing up as if I were punishing a spoon for existing and then went for a walk down to the canal to let my posture uncurl. The man with the fairy lights sat on the railing peeling an orange with the concentration of a botanist. He had a plastic tub of bulbs at his feet and the resigned joy of someone who has more projects than days. He nodded at me and said, \u201cShe\u2019ll have you writing a book with your name on the front and then you\u2019ll have to buy two of those pens that leak ambition,\u201d and I asked him, mildly, whether all towpaths came with clairvoyance. He held up the orange like a lamp and said, \u201cYour mother works fast and so does my cousin,\u201d and I said, \u201cI know,\u201d and we agreed that if you\u2019re going to be discussable you might as well provide snacks.\n\nAt the library that evening, the group held an event that had started as a reading and become a small party because Rani had discovered how to put fairy lights round a lectern without tripping the fire alarm. She had called it Flour and Thunder as if daring weather to take offence, and we had a sign-in sheet that asked for names and whether you\u2019d brought a Tupperware for the leftover buns as though there would ever be leftovers. Claire had organised the chairs so they looked like democracy and Benji had made a zine for the night with a cover that showed a bun in a toga. I read the column and three people made the noise people make when they recognise themselves, the cough-laugh that admits to sentiment without surrendering to it. Then I read a page from the novel in which the man with the lemon tree finally looked up and put his hand on the rough bark, and I dared to leave in the sentence that had felt too much when I wrote it\u2014\u201cHe forgave the tree for surviving,\u201d\u2014and Rani rolled her eyes in a way that conceded the point and claimed it for the South Asian auntie\u2019s collective archive.\n\nAfter, a woman with hair like good grammar approached with the posture of someone who has decided not to make a fuss and is about to do exactly that. She had brought a photograph of her father standing by the Ship Canal in a coat that would have deflected bullets, and she wanted me to have the picture in a way that was not transactional. \u201cHe taught me that you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of salt,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. He taught me that you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to be savoury.\u201d I took the photograph and promised to think about words, and later that night I propped it beside the whisk and the painting because my mantel had trouble saying no to other people\u2019s lives.\n\nWhen I got home there was a shoebox on the mat with my name written by a hand that had learned early to make itself obvious. Inside were three notebooks with covers so battered they had developed personality. I knew before I opened them that they were his, and I knew which his without being told. Mo had written a note that said finally, as if the notebooks had been playing an elaborate game of cache-cache in her house for a decade and she had grown bored. The first page contained an inventory of rope knots and a drawing of a boy\u2019s hand that was not mine and that was mine, and a list in pencil that had been pressed so hard I could read the word indent through the page. Lark\u2019s head, bowline, clove hitch, sheet bend. Under the list he had written, \u201cPractise with a purpose,\u201d and then below that, in a different pen, the words, \u201cDon\u2019t let him learn bad habits.\u201d I sat at the table and copied the names into my own notebook and felt something twist and untwist in my chest with a logic my head had no jurisdiction over.\n\nOn Saturday Alfie met me at the market with a jar of honey that was the colour of a lie told by an affectionate child. He wore a jumper that had been knitted by someone who loved him enough to count rows, and he waved the jar like a trophy in a competition where the prize was winter. He had brought his aunt\u2019s parkin wrapped in greaseproof with a label that read, \u201cDo not perform on the day,\u201d and he made me promise to leave it alone until at least Tuesday, which I converted to Monday with a small internal footnote I hoped his bee ancestors would forgive. We walked past stalls that seemed to be selling the same five sorts of hope, and he told me how being stung had stopped hurting when he learned to expect the sting, and then he corrected himself and said it never stops hurting, you only stop performing surprise for other people. He had watched the stream twice and liked the way my face had decided not to be witty when the judges spoke. He had decided to paint his hives ridiculous colours in spring and had stuck the paint charts under his magnets in a way that made choice an argument worth having with the kettle.\n\nOn Sunday, between the second sleep that counts and the responsibility that puts socks on, I wrote the one-page letter Caro had asked for. I did not proofread it to within an inch of its life because I suspected she could smell fear at that distance. I wrote about how you can tell when a town has learned to carry water and not spill it; about public benches; about ways people talk to one another at the counter when a scone is the excuse; about the old woman who sat with a drizzle cake and read the death notices with curiosity rather than panic; about pepper in gingerbread as a sign of both restraint and revolt. I wrote the three chapters as notes to myself: The Seam, The Draft, The Hands. I wrote the line I did not want it to sound like: I don't want a book that confuses sugar with kindness. I wrote where I wanted it to sit: next to the books people kept by the back door because those were the ones that told them how to get home.\n\nThe reply came at the sort of speed that made me feel seen without being hunted. Caro had a note on everything and the sort of enthusiasm that distinguished itself from flattery by bothering with a comma. She thought The Draft could be both literal and not, and that The Seam might be the place to put a father on purpose and not as an accident of weather. She told me to keep writing, to not try to be delightful on every page because delight is better as a surprise than a house style, and I sat at the table and allowed myself the small, private phrase, \u201cWe are doing this,\u201d which, when said in an empty room, sounds like prayer.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, the town did that thing towns do when you\u2019ve announced something without intending to announce it\u2014it made space and then filled it with opinion. The barber asked if I would include a recipe for the biscuits he pretended not to like and then confessed he liked them a lot when feeling fragile. The woman at the baker\u2019s four doors down told me that if I thought I could write about Eccles cake without being shouted at I should remember I had legs and the ability to run. Mr. Halley held his hat in his hand on a day without sun and asked me if I intended to put anything in about how men forget to eat unless reminded, and I told him the first chapter of any sensible book is called Feed the Men and Nobody Dies, and he laughed and told me I would make enemies in the right places.\n\nOne afternoon I went with the fairy lights man to hang a new string under a bridge that was tired of being a passage and wanted to be an occasion. We climb awkwardly, those of us in our thirties who learned to be careful by falling once in front of a woman we liked. He tied knots that were more confident than mine and I felt my father lean over my shoulder and tell me, kindly, to stop second-guessing. On the underside of the bridge, teenagers had written their names with thick pen in a script that managed to be both defiant and correct, and one of them had drawn a heart in which two initials had been crossed out and replaced, and I wanted to stand there and applaud an honest edit. We finished with hands that smelled like electricity and plastic and sat on the edge with our boots over the water and watched a moorhen behave courageously. \u201cLegacy is daft,\u201d he said. \u201cReputation\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s just how your neighbours talk about you when you\u2019re not there. That you were helpful is enough.\u201d I put that sentence in the book without changing a word and felt, afterwards, that I had not stolen but been lent.\n\nRani, who refused to let any of us develop delusions of grandeur without paperwork, set us a test in the group. She brought in a bag of objects\u2014an onion, a bolt, a child\u2019s mitten, a playing card bent at the corner\u2014and told us to write the first paragraph of a chapter about each without using its name. We groaned and did it and then found, of course, that the bolt had a story about who it had held together, and the mitten belonged to a child who taught his father to invent warmth, and the card had never won a hand because it had never tried to be anything but itself. She put her feet up on a chair and declared us useful citizens, and then she produced a diary and bullied us gently into writing down dates for readings in towns with names that sounded like places a person would go on purpose and not by accident: Todmorden, Hebden Bridge, Glossop. We all protested travel with comic melodrama and then admitted we would share petrol and return with stories about men in pubs who argued about jam.\n\nOn a Tuesday that had no business being as blue as it was, I went to see my mother without warning and found her at the table with three envelopes open and a fourth held gingerly as if it were powdered and might go up in a puff. She had been adding up her bills, which is a phrase that does not sound like the task it is. She looked up and composed her face into the expression she uses when I tell her I\u2019m fine and she decides to pretend I am. I made tea because love is a hot liquid in this house. We talked about rigs in the Ship Canal that my father had admired and the way the council had finally decided to fix the pavement hole with a seriousness that translated into three cones and a sign. She told me she had received a letter from the GP surgery reminding her she was due a something with numbers and she would go because she believes in both medicine and the power of a nurse who remembers your name. I pretended not to clock the slight stiffness in her left shoulder when she took the mug because watching your parent age is like watching weather set in over a landscape you have walked since you were a child\u2014you notice the dips, you tell yourself the water always pooled there, you inventory umbrellas. She caught me looking and said, \u201cI am sturdy enough to complain,\u201d which in her lexicon is a certificate of fitness.\n\nThat night, back at the table, my hands did their now-habitual choreography\u2014measure, mix, wait\u2014and I opened the Father Notebooks again as if they would cease to be legible if I ignored them. On a page near the end, between a list of sandpaper grades and a drawing of a bracket he had meant to buy, he had written one sentence that might have been for me or for a version of himself he still believed he could persuade. \u201cRemember to do things you like in front of the boy.\u201d I stared at it until the words stopped being words and turned back into marks made by a hand that could not have imagined me at a table reading, a cat deciding whether to sleep or supervise, a loaf beginning its slow proof like a patient heartbeat. I turned it into a rule I could live with. I wrote it on the first page of the notebook I\u2019d bought in Bury. I told it to Rani, who underlined it twice and declared it the most useful manifesto she had heard from a man all year.\n\nIn the middle of the week, in the hour that often gets away because it doesn\u2019t try hard to belong to anyone, I sat, finally, in a caf\u00e9 that had nothing to do with the library and tried to write the chapter called The Draft. The draught itself obliged by creeping under the door, touching my ankles and reminding me that romance is mostly about practicalities. I wrote about sleeve cuffs and door edges and a baker\u2019s wrist, about the way tempers shift when the air misbehaves. I wrote about the patch of cold in the Glassworks that had threatened to make a fool of me, and about the metal bowl I turned into a small climate and something like an ark. I wrote about Mrs. Boylan from two doors down when I was nine, who kept a towel under the front door and called the wind her lodger, and how she would say, \u201cHe pays in stories,\u201d and then tell you a lie about her first kiss being stolen by a man standing in a draught. The sentences behaved until they didn\u2019t, and then I gave them a biscuit and they behaved again, and every time my hand reached for the honey I made it take the pen instead.\n\nI ended the week with half of something that looked like a book if you squinted and with a sourdough starter that had been neglected in favour of more theatrical yeasted things and had therefore invented its own personality. Marmalade sat beside it on the counter and regarded the bubbles with the suspicion of a bureaucrat inspecting an expense claim. I fed it with a little flourish as if it deserved ceremony for simply being alive. The window threw the cold kind of light across the floor and my boots made the click that tells you a season has changed its shoes. I sent the pages to Caro with a sheepish line about the commas and the impulse to please that needed managing, and she wrote back with a voice note instead of an email, as if to remind me that sometimes a human mouth is a better editor than red ink. She liked it and liked me liking it, which is a separate joy. She said keep going, which is sometimes the only sentence you need.\n\nLate, when the town had gone to bed with its radios on low and its appliances plugged in as a statement of faith, I sat at the desk and wrote the second scene in which my lemon man looks at a canal and decides to it rather than from it. The cat made her doughnut at my feet and the dough in the bowl proved itself capable of patience and the radiator clanked with that endearing something that sounds like someone apologising far away. I ended the paragraph where he puts his hand on the metal rail and says, out loud and undramatically, \u201cAll right,\u201d and I leaned back and let myself grin. On the table the photograph of the man in the bulletproof coat watched, and on the mantel the ribbon failed to pretend it was not pleased with itself, and in the corner the whisk gleamed in a way that made it look like an instrument of state. I sent Rani a message that said simply \u201cpage\u201d and she replied with twelve clapping hands and a picture of a banana with a red cross through it because she knows how to puncture and inflate in the same gesture.\n\nIn bed, the room finally conceding to the dark, I lay and thought about the morning and the next morning and the mornings after that. I thought about all the little yeses the week had required and the big ones I had managed to give with a straight back. I thought about the way the fairy lights had found their discipline under the bridge and about Jas\u2019s patience folding butter that behaved better than most of the men I\u2019d met in publishing. The moon did that indefinite trick with the cloud and the curtain and the cupboard and I felt overly poetic about it for a second and then allowed myself to be. I slept like a man who had found a way to be hungry and content in the same day, and when I woke I had a sentence in my mouth and a kitchen that smelled like a plan.The morning bent itself into the sort of grey that asks for permission rather than forgiveness. The kettle sang without drama, the radio murmured about roadworks as if narrating a long relationship, and Marmalade performed the delicate act of ignoring me while positioning herself exactly where my elbows would want to be. On the screen, Caro\u2019s name appeared above a subject line that made my stomach practice a small somersault and then pretend it had not. The words were careful and generous at once. She\u2019d shared the pages with two editors she trusted and both had written back with sentences that used the word \u201cshape\u201d as if it were both noun and verb; one of them had once said no to a book about a fox that went on to be a phenomenon, so she liked her yeses considered. Would I be able to meet in town on Thursday? She\u2019d be at the hotel near Piccadilly with a lobby that had ideas about itself, and we could talk timelines, sympathy, commas, and money, in that order or the reverse depending on my superstition. I read it twice with my mouth full of toast and then again after I swallowed like a man checking for a bone, and then I rang Mo because the act of good news is not complete in our family until it has been placed like a dish between us.\n\n\u201cThursday,\u201d she said, as if summoning a day by the scruff. \u201cI\u2019ll come to the station. I\u2019ll behave. I\u2019ll sit at a distance and pretend I\u2019m not your mother, and if she passes me at any point I\u2019ll smile like a woman who knows things and is dignified about it. Take a notebook and a pen that doesn\u2019t announce itself. Wear the shirt that makes you look like you iron, because you don\u2019t and mustn\u2019t be caught out. If they ask you to write quickly, tell them you can write steadily. If they ask you to be charming, be honest instead.\u201d\n\nAt the hotel the carpet had the kind of pattern that is both expensive and tired of being trodden on by people who have opinions about service. The lobby\u2019s plants wore their own lighting, and the coffee was priced as if coffee were an event and not a drink. Caro met me with a smile that contained no edges and a coat that had learned to hang off a shoulder without looking like a performance. We took a table near a window that had mistaken rain for art, and she unfolded the afternoon with a competence that made the thought of the book stop pretending it was a ghost. We spoke about chapters as if they were rooms we could furnish and then leave without apologising, about the way the word north sits down differently in different mouths, about recipes that don\u2019t act like bait. She had a notebook full of names that sounded like both cabins and battleships, and when she spoke about copy editors she did so with what could only be called tenderness. Money arrived last, as promised, and she put the numbers down on paper as if making a small altar. It would not make me a baron; it would make rent feel less theatrical. She asked if I needed time to think and I told her I need time by default, but I did not want to spend it all on doubt. She laughed, properly, and said, \u201cGood,\u201d in a tone I trusted.\n\nI had not intended to orchestrate a collision, but Mo believes in fate if fate can be reached by a tram. She arrived with the weather on her coat and a smile at Caro that would have felled a weaker agent. Their handshake contained a negotiation and an agreement to continue to like one another in a crisis. Caro called her Mo within two sentences and got away with it because names behave differently around women who have boiled milk for a living. They discussed lemons with unnecessary seriousness and timelines with the cheer of people who know how to ride a late bus. When Caro asked about titles, Mo said, with the plainness she uses to shut down melodrama, \u201cCall it whatever you want so long as you remember people take books into kitchens, not the other way round.\u201d Caro wrote that down and underlined it and looked at me over the top of her notebook with the expression of someone delighted to be corrected.\n\nOn the way home, carrying a loaf from a bakery that overpriced its crusts and underpromised on its crumbs, Mo caught the toe of her boot on the doormat that insists we wipe our paws and stumbled in that slow-motion way that suits the elderly and the overcautious. I reached without thinking and she steadied without drama, and we both performed the ritual of pretending this was not a preview of later. In the kitchen she rolled her left shoulder in a circle that implied honesty more than pain and said, \u201cIt gets stiff when the weather makes a poem of itself. I\u2019ll mention it when I go in for the numbers thing. Don\u2019t say \u2018frozen shoulder\u2019 or I\u2019ll put you in the bin.\u201d I said nothing about bins or ice or the way her tea mug rattled, and instead sat and let her tell me about a woman she\u2019d met on the bus who had dyed her hair blue in defiance of an invisible council of critics and had been praised by teenagers as if she\u2019d invented the sky.\n\nAt the library the table looked like a cross between a field hospital and a craft fair. Rani had pinned an agenda to the corkboard with dots that demanded attention, and she wore a scarf that she claimed could double as a banner if revolution broke out in the biography section. I read the beginning of The Draft, and midway through the second paragraph a chair scraped and then obediently returned to its station, and I had the small high of speaking sentences that had been difficult to coax. Benji said it made his wrists cold in a satisfying way. Claire said I needed one more woman who didn\u2019t care about my metaphors. Richard, bless him, described the draft in terms of railway cuttings and incline resistance and then, because he is a friend, asked me if I was going to put commas in places where they would not embarrass us. We ate biscuits with the seriousness of surgeons on their break and planned a trip to Hebden Bridge where the bookshop owner had promised to overorder on optimism and chairs.\n\nWhen the world is too noisy, I bake things that can afford to fail. I told myself that using the last of the expensive saffron in a midweek experiment would teach me a lesson about humility. Marmalade heard the jar open and launched herself gracefully into the exact space where gravity would be most persuasive if it wanted to win, and for a second the air was full of red filaments that fell as if someone had insulted them. We picked threads from the floor like thieves and I put the rescued shreds into milk and watched it take the colour the way a person takes a compliment only if they believe it. I made a knot I did not intend to keep and ate it hot with honey because I could not think of a reason not to, and my mood, which had tilted towards the edge, found the middle again because sometimes it is as simple as the smell of something that does not require a verdict.\n\nThe train to Hebden Bridge did its best to prove that steel has a sense of humour. We sat with our scripts and our Tupperware and a conviction that we would triumph by numbers alone. Out the window the hills behaved like they had been waiting to be noticed. In the carriage a woman knitted the sort of cardigan that made you think of solved problems, a man whispered into a phone as if conspiring with his own life, and a girl read a horror novel with an expression that suggested she would not be taken in by cheap jumps. The bookshop had windows that believed in afternoon light and a floor that had decided to slope long ago. We read to a room of expectant coats and faces arranged into interest, and when I did the paragraph about a draft finding your wrists, a man in a cap said, at normal volume, \u201cAye,\u201d and then blushed like a child who has been caught out loving. After, a woman told me her mother used to stand with the oven door open and warm the kitchen as if it were a body, and that in her house the word \u201cproof\u201d had nothing to do with documents. I signed three copies of a book I had not yet written as if I were witnessing a marriage that would not take place for years and bought a second-hand paperback with a flyleaf that had loved someone else more than it loved me.\n\nWhen we were packing the banner back into its indignity, my phone buzzed with the plain text of fear. Mo had rung the surgery because the stiffness had become honest and the nurse had made the sort of face over the line you can hear. It wasn\u2019t urgent, which is a word that can be both cloak and knife; it was a come-in for tests and don\u2019t panic in extremely large letters. I told Rani in three sentences and she became a shape we all rely on, folded the chairs with vengeance, corralled our troupe, pressed money into my hand as if I had forgotten I possessed any, and ordered me to send her a text the second I knew anything even if the result was banal. On the bus to the clinic the air was the kind that tells you to be grateful for windows. I sat with my head against the cold and watched other people carry their catastrophes in plastic folders. The nurse was brisk and kind in a way that made me miss being looked after. Mo did not apologise to her body for being a body; she surrendered an arm, an elbow, a list of symptoms that were trivia-colored and grievances that were new. The tests would take a week, which in the language of worry is a year. We walked home with her insisting muscles were attention-seekers and me pretending to believe her. We made soup that tasted like refusing to give in, and she told me again to say yes to the book without twitching.\n\nCaro sent a draft contract with notes in the margin that sounded like a human being. There were paragraphs about territories that made me feel like a landowner and then immediately like a thief who had nothing to show for his theft but guilt. The advance looked like a thing that could turn an old oven into one that didn\u2019t sulk on the left. I allowed myself the fantasy of paying my mother rent without theatre, of buying Marmalade the kind of food that implies she is royalty and I am staff, of not counting the days between invoices like beads on a string. I wrote a scene in the novel in which my lemon man took his hand away from the tree and felt, to his own irritation, that his palm had learned something by contact. He walked along a canal that was not ours, watched a swan behave as if it owned the list of names in the Civic Registry, and admitted, out loud in a paragraph, that he had absolutely no idea where he was going but preferred moving to standing still.\n\nJas asked if I wanted to go in on a bulk order of quince because the market stall woman had misjudged the appetite of a town and was now looking at a crate like I look at my novel on the bad days. We met in the market\u2019s late afternoon when everything has become a little too honest. She had a list and a rolled-up tea towel with a stain in the exact shape of an apology. We drank tea that had been brewed in a metal kettle older than Benji\u2019s optimism and watched a man buy a piece of smoked cheese that required its own legend. Jas told me, carefully, about a built life that had not become a marriage and the odd relief of a disaster that is administrative rather than apocalyptic. I told her about the notebooks in my father\u2019s handwriting and her face did the thing it does when someone brings her a pastry she respects. We did not make a promise to talk about any of it again, which felt like a promise worth trusting.\n\nWe decided that saying yes requires a ceremony, however small. Rani arrived with a sign that had been amended so many times it had become postmodern, Alfie came with a jar of honey that had learned to taste of the place it had been made, Claire brought a bottle of something bubbly that had not been grown anywhere near here and refused to feel guilty about it, and Mr. Halley knocked twice and then once and presented a story like a dish\u2014how he had taken a corner too fast and learned the names of his own hands. Jas came late with a tin that did not advertise its contents and the expression of someone who has kept something safe. We set the good plates on the table because if you can\u2019t get the good plates out to celebrate a contract you may as well sell them. I said, into the kitchen air, that I had signed a piece of paper and did not feel like an imposter because everyone was also eating. We raised mugs and glasses and a whisk because Mo insisted the whisk had earned the right to attend any ceremony. I made a toast that included the word \u201cbread\u201d only once and used the word \u201cenough\u201d more than once, because there are times when you must pick a noun you can live inside.\n\nLater, when their coats had gathered themselves and taken their owners home, I stood at the sink and watched the fat from the stew behave like patterns I could not read and put my hands into the hot water as if I could acquire competence by immersion. The flat held the shape of company for a little while, the chairs inclined towards one another as if they had been listening, the air warm with the intelligence of recent laughter. On the mantel the ribbon had rotated in the draught and was showing its less photogenic side, the painting of the aqueduct watched with patience, the whisk gleamed in a way that implied it had ambitions beyond egg whites. I dried my hands and wrote a page before bed, because I have discovered that if I do not feed the book before sleep it comes to the edge of the bed and asks for a glass of water in a child\u2019s voice.\n\nA week has a way of wandering if you don\u2019t pin it, and this one required new pins. The results at the surgery described a problem with words that sounded like a legal document: degeneration, inflammation, an old injury that had taken its time to introduce itself properly. It was not a catastrophe. It was an adjustment. Physiotherapy. Exercises in a corridor that had decided to smell of disinfectant and resilience. A nurse who said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be cross,\u201d as if pronouncing a benediction. Mo consented to being looked after as if she were humouring us, resolved to take rest as if rest were a suspect neighbour, and stared a leaflet into submission. We got home and I moved the heavy pan to a lower cupboard without being told to, and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t start behaving like I\u2019m a legend whose relics must be venerated,\u201d and then smiled because she knows how to leave a gentleness on a phrase that might otherwise cause trouble.\n\nCaro sent back my notes with her notes on my notes and a question about whether I would mind if the cover didn\u2019t show a loaf but a map. I told her I wanted the sort of cover that would look at home on a kitchen table and not embarrassed in a train carriage, and she wrote back a single sentence that made me tear up for no grand reason: \u201cWe will make the kind of book that sits by the back door.\u201d Contracts were printed on paper that made me feel complicit in deforestation and responsibility. I signed without flourishing because my father\u2019s hand had taught me that flourishes hide trouble. We spoke about a launch that would not pretend to be a coronation. Claire offered the theatre on a night when the roof did not leak, Rani promised a lectern that would not tempt me to slam it, Benji proposed zines tucked under chairs like stowaways, and Richard said he would liaise with the man who had opinions about microphones and pronounce him a friend for the evening.\n\nThe lemon man had been sulking in a corner of my head and now he came out and admitted he had stopped being afraid of being too obvious. He stood in a kitchen that was not mine with a kettle that had learned to obey a hand it did not recognise. He sliced a lemon with a knife that was not very sharp and decided he would write a letter to a person he had not forgiven and tell them they had not broken him, they had bent him into a shape that turned out to be useful in a storm. He walked the path by the water and said hello to a moorhen and did not take it personally when the moorhen ignored him. I wrote him into a tram, and for the first time he did not consider jumping off before his stop in the name of drama.\n\nAt six one morning, the hour that belongs to milkmen and women who train for marathons and men who cannot resist the message tone in their pocket, I woke to Marmalade standing on my chest with the unambiguous expression that translates as, If you think about the book before you think about my breakfast I will move out. The scoop made its small moons, the tin surrendered, and the house reclaimed its equilibrium. I opened the laptop and the email was there, tidy as a sandwich. Caro had spoken to production. If we wanted to catch a season that made sense, I would need to deliver the first complete draft in six months. My mother would say that time was elastic and could be taught manners; I thought of the lemon man, of Jas folding butter, of Mr. Halley\u2019s admonition to sit my hands, and I said the sentence out loud that turns air into a contract. I can do that. Then, because words are cheap until you feed them, I wrote four pages before breakfast and did not tell anyone until lunch.\n\nOn Saturday we tried being tourists in our own lives. The markets were full without being crowded, the sky had ventured a pale blue, and a busker with a borrowed voice sang a song that had made a generation slow dance. Alfie presented me with a small jar of pollen as if I were a priest and he had a confession, and I bought it and didn\u2019t understand it and took it home anyway because sometimes the point is not comprehension but participation. Jas had a tray of pastries that did not pretend to be polite, and the woman from the stall with the handsome cheese told me that my column had made her husband argue with a spoon and she had enjoyed watching him lose. Mr. Halley pointed at a poster on the side of the bus shelter advertising a council meeting and suggested, with the gravity of a man who had fought a battle with a pot plant and won, that Mo ought to attend and then accidentally run it.\n\nWe ended the day with onion gravy and chips from a place that had been given more awards than it had wall space. In Mo\u2019s front room the ribbon had been relocated to a spot near the clock where it could observe time without being its servant, the photograph of the man by the canal had acquired company in the form of a snapshot of a baby who had no idea she had been born into a family that would discuss her elbows for a week, and Marmalade had discovered that if she stared at the fish tank in the dentist\u2019s window for long enough she could see herself and make peace with the idea that another cat existed. We ate with our elbows on the table because dignity is for breakfast, and Mo told me about a woman her age who had gone to the physio and come back with an exercise band and a belief in her glutes, and I said the word glutes in a way that made us both laugh because some words are only funny when said in your mother\u2019s kitchen.\n\nThat night, tired in the good way and hollowed out by tasks rather than by fear, I put the bowl on the counter with its dependable weight and fed the starter that had forgiven me for my flirtations with commercial yeast. The radio murmured a match report as if reading a bedtime story to a nation, the upstairs neighbour dropped a shoe like a period at the end of a sentence that had gone on too long, and outside the fairy lights on the bridge came on with the discretion of a curtain opening at the exact moment it remembers it is paid to open. I wrote a paragraph about a girl who chooses her paving stones and a woman who hides saffron in a jar that used to belong to her grandmother\u2019s buttons, and then I turned the laptop off and let the room become simple again. On the table the contract sat under a book to encourage its manners, on the mantel the whisk shone like an instrument of state, on my phone Rani had sent a photograph of a chair with the caption SIX and three exclamation marks, and in my hands, flour did what it has always done for me when the world asks me to stand up straight. I kneaded until the dough stopped keeping score and I could feel my own shape in my palms, and when I finally slept, it was with the knowledge that morning would arrive without needing me to instruct it and that I would be ready, tea in hand, to say yes in the small ways that keep the large ones honest.\n\nThe next week tested my newfound confidence as if it were a pair of shoes. The first event was a small radio spot with a presenter who had the voice of a man who had found his own throat late and was still grateful. The studio smelled of old carpet and fresh coffee, which is to say it smelled like professionalism. He introduced me as if I had already written three books and one of them contained an answer to something important, and I remembered Rani\u2019s advice to decline grandeur politely without throwing it back like a child. We spoke about parkin as if it were a form of voting, about the weather as if it had a grievance, about the act of handing someone a bun and believing it could help. In the middle of a sentence about quince I looked through the glass and saw Mo in the waiting area, knees together in the way she sits when pretending to be demure, and she mouthed the word \u201cbehave\u201d and then immediately laughed at herself. After, the producer handed me a biscuit in the manner of a man who had decided I was likely to forget to eat if unprompted, and the presenter whispered, as if revealing a library secret, that he had cried at the line about the draught and had then thought about his grandfather and checked himself in the toilet mirror until he looked like a man who could go back to his desk and read emails.\n\nSchool visits have a way of turning a person into a collection of useful anecdotes, and I learned how to tell mine like a tale rather than a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The year tens wanted to know if you could earn good money writing about bread and whether I had ever been on proper telly and if I could put their band in the acknowledgements. In a cooking classroom with knives tethered like nervous pets, we stirred batter and they leaned on the counter and I watched them pretend not to hope that someone would tell them they were good at something. A boy asked if I\u2019d ever been to London without my mother and I said yes and he looked impressed as if I\u2019d just said I\u2019d slept in a tent in the rain. A girl said she liked when I wrote about men being a bit useless and still deserving cake, and I told her that was my favourite subject and she rolled her eyes as if I were obvious and grand and correct.\n\nBetween days that belonged to other people I made the private, ordinary ones work. I went early to the physio with Mo and took notes as if muscles had a curriculum. The physio had forearms that could persuade a brick to behave and a kindness that arrived like a cushion. \u201cIt will be boring,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be glorious in its boring. Do it anyway.\u201d We bought a ridiculous ball to roll against a wall, a band that looked like something a child had made and turned out to be a device for truth, and stickers like we were bribing a six-year-old and decided we were. We came home and did our first set with the solemnity of a launch, and Mo put a sticker on the calendar and said, \u201cThat\u2019s me defying entropy,\u201d and then she ate a biscuit to balance the universe.\n\nThe book\u2019s skeleton began to stand up in my notebook, a wonky figure given life by paragraphs that had been playing dead for months. The Seam took my father and returned him without embalming him, The Draft took my own hands and asked them questions, The Hands took people I have watched measure flour and translated them into a language that let someone in Bolton read about a woman in Bradford and nod at the same moment. Caro sent me emails that acted like lights down a corridor, and when I sent her a page that I knew was half a page she did not scold, she asked me what belonged next, which is why I chose her to stand next to my work with a clip and a pen.\n\nJas came round one afternoon with a bag that clinked because she had bought jars at a charity shop that had previously held optimism and now wanted stewed fruit. We sterilised like champions, the kitchen steamed, Marmalade sulked because no one had consulted her, and the quinces reluctantly gave up their shapes and turned into something a spoon could make sense of. We talked about nothing for a while and then about everything, which is the right order. She stayed for tea and another, and when she left I found a postcard on the table from a patisserie in Vienna, a photograph of a cake that had decided to be a sculpture, and on the back she had written, \u201cButter says yes to heat if you keep your nerve,\u201d which struck me as the sort of sentence you can use for almost any problem if you are brave or foolish.\n\nAt night, when the town performed its quiet and the canal did its black mirror trick and the trams whispered the news of the city, I sat with the page and sometimes produced a neat paragraph and sometimes produced a cross face. On those nights I paced the kitchen and said the sort of myths to myself that suit men alone in rooms\u2014about work, about fathers, about weather\u2014and then I peeled them off like wallpaper and tried again. I learned to end the day with something small done: a paragraph that did not embarrass me, a dough folded for the morning, a biscuit put aside for a friend, a message sent to a person who had given me a story and needed to know it had become something. When sleep came it did not always arrive with its arms open; when it did, I was grateful enough to forgive it for being late.\n\nThe morning Mo rang to say she had found the old recipe for a kind of bread her mother had made and could not name, I left the house with my keys still in my hand as if I were fleeing a crime scene. The paper was soft with being held and the handwriting had been done with a nib that misbehaved. The first line read, \u201cEnough flour for purpose,\u201d the sort of instruction that would give modern bakers an existential crisis. We made it together to see what purpose meant, me reading the ghosts of measurements, her stopping me when my wrist lied, the oven doing its old uneven song. It came out squat and proud and smelling like comfort, and we ate a slice with butter that tried to escape and failed and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d and then, under her breath, \u201cHello,\u201d in a tone that made my eyes behave badly. I put the recipe in a plastic sleeve because I am not above acts of clerical devotion, and I wrote the story down before it started to turn into legend in my hands.\n\nMonths have a way of stepping up behind you and clearing their throat, and this one was no different. The book had become more than a rumour; the novel had stopped sulking at corners and started turning them. Mo\u2019s shoulder, worked into ordinary, had added a repertoire of noises to our living room soundtrack, and we could tell the difference between a good click and a rude one. The fairy lights under the bridge had been replaced twice and re-tied with a competence that suggests love. The man at the butcher had decided paprika was not a human right after all but a kindness he would not be held hostage by. Mr. Halley had a new hat that made him look like a man you ought to take seriously when he said the winter of eighty-six was a proper winter. Marmalade learned to open a cupboard and then, having mastered it, decided she would rather be admired than use her powers.\n\nOne night, at the end of a day that had required me to be seven people\u2014son, writer, neighbour, baker, man in a shop choosing a lemon, man on a bus watching a toddler negotiate stairs, citizen\u2014Rani sent a photograph of the theatre lit up for an event that was not ours. \u201cSoon,\u201d she wrote, which can be a threat or a promise. I held the phone and felt the panic that pretends to be a friend when you have something to lose, and then I took a pan out of the cupboard because sometimes the only thing to do with nerves is to cook them down. I made onion gravy with patience and wine and the sort of attention I reserve for sentences I hate and people I love, and halfway through I remembered I had promised to write five hundred words before bed and I wrote six hundred and stopped before a paragraph ended so I could begin clean the next day. Then I stood at the window, the city stroking its own back with light, the canal holding steady as if to say I\u2019ve got you, and thought how strange and lucky it is to be a person who can turn a day into a line and a line into a loaf and give both away without feeling emptied.\n\nWhen I finally lay down, the cat took her place with the entitlement of the only creature in the house sure of her job. The whisk on the mantel tilted a fraction in the breeze we pretend not to have. Somewhere a tram sighed as if satisfied with a shift completed without incident. My hands, which had learned to recognise the proofing bowl in the dark, rested in the space between. Morning would come and bring with it the list and the kettle and the pages I had not yet offended, and perhaps a man with a moustache, perhaps a child with a question, perhaps a bread that wanted to tell me who I was trying to be. I closed my eyes and told the coming day I would meet it at the door with my shoulders down and my pen ready, and in the last seconds before sleep I thought, without embarrassment, that I might be equal to what I had asked for.",

                              "content": "The morning began with an accident of light. The sun pushed through a torn cloud, finding the narrow slice of kitchen that held my mixing bowls and the jar of cardamom seeds. It made the flour on the worktop shine as if each tiny particle had a voice. My kettle coughed into life. Sale was a cold town when it wanted to be, and lately it wanted to be, but in the kitchen there was heat, and the smell of last night\u2019s bake still clung to the curtains. I had made orange-scented brioche and eaten two of them before they were even cool, and I told myself it was research, that my protagonist in the new novel\u2014stuck in a storm and haunted by the memory of a lemon tree\u2014would need to understand warm bread. He did not. I did.\n\n\u201cMarmalade,\u201d I said, as the cat pawed at the cupboard door. \u201cYou have exactly sixty minutes until I have to write.\u201d\n\nMarmalade made no promises. She was ginger and rotund and had the look of a creature who believed time was elastic and human obligations fictive. She pushed her head against my shin and let out a train whistle of a meow. The cupboard door creaked open and I fished out her tin. As she ate, I stood by the window and watched a man on the canal towpath string fairy lights along the railings of the footbridge. It was not yet December, but in Sale, winter came early in the decorations. They made the water look like a line of tiny captured moons.\n\nOn the table lay my notebook, scuffed and cracked, pages gone soft with the oil of my hands. A friend had once told me writing was mostly carpentry and patience: you cut, you sand, you leave it alone, you return. I had three short stories published in magazines no one had heard of and a novel that a small press had printed in a run so limited it felt like a dare. My mother\u2014Mo\u2014kept a copy propped in her front room as if it were stained glass. HEY, TAKE WHAT YOU CAN. She told the postman I was a novelist. She told the pharmacist I was a novelist. She told the woman at the bus stop that I was a novelist, and that I\u2019d been ignored by the big London houses because of my northern vowels. In her telling I was an avenger. In reality, here I was, in a modest terrace near the Waterside Arts Centre, making bread to steady my hands for scenes I could not yet see.\n\nMy phone hummed on the worktop. A message from Rani: remember 11 a.m. Don\u2019t be late again or I will break your thumbs. Hearts. A biscuit emoji.\n\nMy writing group met at the caf\u00e9 in the library because none of us possessed enough chairs to seat everyone. Rani ran it with the brisk charm of a nurse and the chaos of a DJ. She\u2019d had two poems in collections with forewords by people with a dozen initials after their names. She wore yellow trainers no matter the weather, and a leather jacket she called her portable bravery.\n\nI had time. On the radio a presenter spoke with reverent dread about an approaching storm that would bounce off the Pennines and turn the trams into creaking violins. I turned it down, pressed my thumb into the top of a dough ball that had been rising slowly under a tea towel. It yielded with relief. There was a good shape there. I rolled it into ropes, tied them as if I were knotting worries, and set them onto a tray. The oven sighed open. When I shut it, the glass fogged and for a second I saw my own face blurred, a stranger peering at me through winter.\n\nMo called at nine thirty-three. She had a talent for arriving in the minute in which I was most likely to make excuses to the day.\n\n\u201cSeb,\u201d she said. She called me Seb even though she had named me Sebastian and most of the world, when it bothered, went with Seb or Bash or, once, Sable. \u201cI need you to look at a tap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your plumber.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not, but he\u2019s not my plumber either. He\u2019s late. They\u2019re all late. Is it in their training? Lesson three: you\u2019ll never be on time again? I can hear the tap across the road. There\u2019s a woman over there, I see her in the mornings with the dachshund. Honestly, if my tap is louder than the putter of a little dog, something is wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour tap is louder than the dog? That\u2019s catastrophic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the word. Catastrophic. I\u2019ll make you a sandwich. Beetroot and Stilton. I know, I know, the colour is alarming.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always loved an alarming sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, Mr. Marmalade Brioche. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t see your little posts online.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not little,\u201d I said.\n\nShe laughed, quick and bright, a bell over the bridge. \u201cCome at eleven? Or when your group ends. I don\u2019t want to be a clich\u00e9 mother. I don\u2019t want them talking and saying, there, she is, the classic northern mother, fussing with her son.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could never be a clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo write. Go write and then come sort my catastrophe.\u201d\n\nWe rang off and I put on my scarf and the coat with missing buttons that made me look like a student. Marmalade angled her head to watch the door. \u201cDon\u2019t think about eating the dough,\u201d I warned her. \u201cIt\u2019s beneath you to be that kind of clich\u00e9.\u201d\n\nOn the Metrolink the windows were scratched with messages from men who didn\u2019t know how to leave a legacy any other way. Two schoolgirls drew diamonds on each other\u2019s hands. A man with a captain\u2019s beard dozed and missed three stops. The conductor at Dane Road made a joke about singing in the wind and only one person laughed, and I wanted to ask him if it mattered to him that it was only one person, and did he hold onto each laugh like a coin, and did it still count if someone laughed and then immediately turned to take it back with a glare. I kept my thoughts to myself and got off at the Waterside.\n\nRani was at a corner table with a notebook the size of a dinner tray. \u201cYou\u2019re on time,\u201d she said, as if my punctuality were an act of formal rebellion. \u201cHow\u2019s the baking?\u201d\n\n\u201cBetter than the writing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always is. You should bake a poem. Mary Berry would say\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t say Mary Berry.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014that a poem needs to rise, darling, and the crumb must be\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it.\u201d I laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not even that show.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat show? I\u2019m making these notes for me. I\u2019m going to pitch a TV programme called Flour Power. Do you know how many repeats there are in the day? I could be a millionaire by Tuesday.\u201d\n\nI took a sip of the coffee she slid to me that was more moral support than caffeine. \u201cI wrote six hundred words,\u201d I said, lying up.\n\n\u201cGood.\u201d She knew I was lying and gave me the lie as a gift. \u201cRead it.\u201d\n\nMy six hundred words were one hundred and eighty-eight words carefully spaced and made to look like they were more by way of generous line breaks. Rani listened. She touched the margin with her index finger as if she could push the sentences deeper into themselves. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere he kneels to tie his laces and he thinks about how the world looks from the ground. That. Keep that. You\u2019re good when you\u2019re literally looking at something. No offence, but when you get out of your head, you get into the good stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always in my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe bake in your head. Use your head as an oven. What does it smell like, Seb\u2019s head? Cloves and resentment?\u201d\n\n\u201cCloves and honey,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd a trace of washing powder.\u201d\n\nOur group arrived in a soft wave: Benji with his backpack full of zines; Claire with her front-of-house smile from the theatre she ran; a man called Richard who was building a poem out of the names of trains. We workshopped. We were kind and sometimes not kind in ways that taught us to be better at both. I felt the world narrow and then open and then narrow again, and in each shape there was a different version of me: baker, writer, son.\n\nAt noon I hugged Rani and told her about Mo\u2019s tap.\n\n\u201cBeetroot and Stilton,\u201d she said. \u201cTake a picture. Put it in your book.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put your shoes in my book.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone will think the character is confident.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd right.\u201d\n\nOn the towpath the fairy lights were illuminated now and useless in daylight. A toddler in a puffer coat kicked a frozen leaf as if it were an enemy. At Mo\u2019s house the front step had one of those mats that demanded you wipe your paws. She opened the door wearing an apron printed with lemons, her hair pinned up with two pencils as if she had been arrested by an urgent thought. She kissed my cheek and held my hand too long. It was her worst habit and my favourite.\n\n\u201cIn,\u201d she said, \u201cin, before we lose all the heat in this house and the bill comes through the letterbox and laughs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were always good at personifying utility companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, well. They deserve it.\u201d She led me to the kitchen where the tap did, indeed, hiss. \u201cSee? The plumber says one. He says one. He said he\u2019s on the way. I told him I would be at his house at midnight if he didn\u2019t come.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might.\u201d\n\nI crouched under the sink. The cupboard smelled of old wood and something like dill. I had no real plans for fixing anything. I opened my mouth to say, I\u2019ll call, I\u2019ll be polite, he\u2019s probably on his way, when the doorbell rang. Mo flapped her hand at me.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be him,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cor a politician. Either way I\u2019m going to make him tea and ask him if his mother\u2019s proud.\u201d\n\nThe plumber was ten years younger than me and looked as if he\u2019d replaced a tap in the womb. He bounded in and said hello to my mother as if he\u2019d known her since the bin men were respected. He bent under the sink, made the noises of someone who had seen a future written in copper pipe, and then assured us it was fixable. He had a name that might have also been the name of a soap opera character with a secret. Dean.\n\n\u201cDean,\u201d my mother said, as if testing whether it contained any extra vowels. \u201cWould you like a biscuit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m good,\u201d he said, in the way that meant he would be better with a biscuit but thought saying so would be too forward.\n\n\u201cSebastian,\u201d she said, \u201cmake Dean two cups of tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cDean,\u201d I said, \u201cdo you take sugar?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sweet enough.\u201d\n\nMo laughed. She always loved a self-mythologist. I made the tea. I thought of the oven at home with its gentle heat and of Marmalade fairy-stepping across the window ledge and knocking a bag of rye flour onto the floor. The day had become a place I wanted to be\u2014Mo at my shoulder, Dean talking in a dialect of numbers and measures. I could write this. I never wrote the worst things and I never wrote them in the present tense. Not then. Not yet.\n\nWhen Dean left, the kitchen was quiet and the tap was chastened. Mo made the promised sandwiches. There are two ways to cut a sandwich and she always did both. She laid the triangles and rectangles on a plate with the pride of an artist who had spent a restless night stitching a problem into a solution. The beetroot bled onto the bread. The Stilton glowered. We ate in silence for the first few mouthfuls, because her sandwiches demanded reverence.\n\n\u201cSeb,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you going to enter that baking thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat baking thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe one from the magazine. Your Auntie Kath gave me the leaflet. She said, tell Seb. It\u2019s amateur, so you\u2019re allowed to be a semi-professional in your heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already too professional in my heart. It would be an unfair advantage.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be daft. You make nice things and you put them on the internet and people click little hearts. You should have bigger hearts. And finally make some money. God knows your writing makes you a lot of satisfaction in the night and a lot of rent from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI pay rent.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you heck. You slip fifty quid into my coat pocket at Christmas and call me a landlord. I\u2019m not complaining.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing okay, Mo.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you are. I know. But why not this? Baking is not cheating on writing. You think it is. It isn\u2019t. Remember when you were little and you had that inflatable dinosaur\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTerry.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014Terry, the carnivore. You used to put him in the bath and then run into the kitchen to get a spoon and pretend you were feeding him pudding. He was an inflatable. He was full of air. But you fed him and you said, this is how he will grow. You always had more than one thing in your arms.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t an organised child.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were exactly yourself. Enter it. I want to be on television with an inappropriate sign. The northern mother. The clich\u00e9. I will write, I gave him the whisk.\u201d\n\nI laughed, but the thought lodged in the place where all my ill-advised ideas multiplied. \u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cNo. Do it. Think later.\u201d\n\nWe talked about other things. The old neighbour who had moved away because her son wanted her to be closer to his family and she did not want to be closer to anyone; the woman at the butcher who had started offering paprika with every order like a wizard\u2019s trick; my cousin\u2019s new baby who had a head like a potato, in the best possible way. I left with leftovers and with a scarf Mo insisted I bring because \u201cyou always underestimate the cold, as if you have a contract with the wind.\u201d\n\nAt home Marmalade had not eaten the dough but had slept on the bag of flour until her fur was dusted white. She looked at me as if she were a ghost risen from meal. I brushed her and the air was a little snowstorm. The oven had gone to sleep and needed waking with a firm hand. I baked the knots I\u2019d tied earlier. The house filled with a smell that made thinking about fiction difficult. Then, at the table, with flour on my fingers, I opened my laptop and my email chimed.\n\nAnd there it was: a subject line that looked like a dare.\n\nWe\u2019re pleased to invite you to the final.\n\nFor a second I thought it was spam, the kind that wants you to believe you\u2019ve won the lottery in a nation that uses different commas. Then I saw the logo of the magazine. Hearth & Home. Rani had mocked it as a magazine that imagined all emergencies could be solved by a well-folded throw. They ran a competition every year, the Great Northern Bake Off albeit without the rights, with a regional tour and a final filmed live for a video stream that people watched from sofas and phones as if they were catching up with a friend. I had sent in a photograph of my cardamom swirls and a recipe for my salted honey cake. I had done it after two glasses of wine and a nudge from a memory of Mo\u2019s hands on my shoulders. I had sent it and then tucked the act away in the secret drawer where I kept things I wanted to happen without the embarrassment of wanting.\n\nI clicked.\n\nDear Sebastian, \n\nWe\u2019re delighted to invite you to take part in the final of the Hearth & Home Amateur Baking Challenge. Your submission was a joy to read, and our judges were impressed by the originality of your flavours and the clarity of your method. The final will be held at the Glassworks in Castlefield on the 12th. We\u2019ll be in touch with technical details (COVID compliance etc.) and a list of ingredients we\u2019ll provide. We\u2019d love you to prepare a showstopper on the theme of \u201cNorthern Routes.\u201d \n\nPlease confirm your availability as soon as possible. \n\nAll best, \n\nShivani\nHearth & Home Events\n\nI read it twice and then a third time in which none of the words seemed to be language, just shapes spinning. The Glassworks. Castlefield. The word final hugged the page and glowed. I laughed, a sound like someone unwrapping foil slowly in a church. I stood and then sat immediately as my knees made an official complaint. \u201cMarmalade,\u201d I said. \u201cWe may be about to experience a brush with the minor leagues.\u201d\n\nShe blinked. A greenish blink, serpentine. I forwarded the email to Rani with no body and then had to send a second one with a body because what if she thought I\u2019d been hacked by a baker whose first act of malice would be to send invitations to strangers. My phone rang. Rani doesn\u2019t believe in text messages for certain categories of excitement.\n\n\u201cThis is a story,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a story with a predictable arc and yet I am thrilled. I\u2019ll be in the audience shouting when everyone else is being politely northern. I\u2019ll bring a sign that says SEB RISES.\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t said yes yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cSay it. Say yes. Say yes on the phone to me. I will pretend to be the events manager if you need a rehearsal.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, and the word left my mouth and became a currency I could spend on other yeses. I typed the reply: I would be delighted to accept.\n\nI called Mo.\n\n\u201cHearth & Home,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWhat about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the final.\u201d\n\nThere was a small noise. Not shock\u2014relief, I think, a distant bell confirming the hour. \u201cYou are,\u201d she said. \u201cCourse you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are not allowed to heckle the judges.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019ll just whisper loudly. Oh, my heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not ninety. I\u2019ll just be a little bit proud in the privacy of my stern face. I\u2019ll get a new coat.\u201d\n\n\u201cA coat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be on the stream, they can\u2019t see me in this old thing where the zip has ideas about my personality. Oh. Northern Routes. What does that mean? Trains? Pie?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means never say pie to anyone from Wigan unless you mean pie.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father,\u201d she began, and stopped, then said, carefully, \u201cwould have been delighted.\u201d\n\nWe didn\u2019t say his name much. Not because it hurt\u2014pain becomes furniture\u2014but because the room took on a shape when we did, and we were tired of rearranging ourselves. He had been someone who believed in work and in tools and in the idea of a day fulfilled. He\u2019d died ten years ago on a day that had looked like any day, and on bad nights I still heard the rattle of tea mugs he\u2019d put out that morning, as if there was a thin place between then and now and it could be crossed if only you knew the tune.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make him a pie,\u201d I said, which was what we said when we wanted to put something back and couldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make him a pie,\u201d she said, and then, brisk again, \u201cRight. Now. Do you need me to taste? I can do it. I\u2019ll do it for England. I\u2019ll do it for Greater Manchester. I\u2019ll do it for our street.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring a prototype tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake two. We\u2019ll need a control.\u201d\n\nI hung up and pink light came through the window, a flare on the canal, the fairy lights less ridiculous now that the day frayed. I felt the strange elasticity of time when it doubles back and lets you begin again right where you are. I opened my cupboards and took stock. Flour enough to feed a parade. Sugar like quiet snow. Butter. Candied peel I\u2019d been saving for a reason that had only ever been imaginary. I opened the spice jar and the cardamom hit me with its green hush. Northern Routes. Routes, not roots. Journeys, maps, tracks. The Bridgewater Canal. The trams that slid along like careful knives. The motorway that carried us to the sea and back with chips. The recipes that had travelled in pockets and in handbags. Saffron from a market in Bury that made my fingers gold for days. FRANKS written in fading paint on a sign for a butcher who had outlived three economies. I chose a notebook page and wrote: seed cake studded with caraway and black tea soaked fruit. And beneath it: parkin reinvented, with rye and a seam of quince. And then: a braid that looks like the canal.\n\nI began to bake the way some people begin to pray\u2014not loud, not showy, but with a straightening of the back. I\u2019d thought being invited into anything would make me arrogant. It made me careful. I measured and then measured again. I thought of my body carrying a recipe that belonged to people I had known and to people I had never met. I loved, suddenly, with a childish purity, the idea that I would be judged by women in cardigans and men in jumpers who had taught themselves how to make puff pastry by watching television on a low volume so as not to wake their children.\n\nAt nine I sat down with a wedge of test parkin that was still, frankly, a bit raw in the middle. I liked it anyway. Through the wall I heard my neighbour singing along to a song that had been famous when we were young and has never been forgiven for its optimism. I opened my laptop with sticky fingers and wrote five hundred words, real words this time, words that made my narrator reach for a handrail and miss and laugh. I thought of tomorrow, of a market for quince I did not need, of Rani\u2019s sign. I went to bed with the smell of ginger in my hair and the rhythm of a recipe in my heart.\n\nIn the night I dreamed of the Glassworks, which I had never visited. I stood in a huge room with iron beams and a floor that remembered the weight of a hundred years. The judges were two women called Elsie and Mei-Lin and a man with a moustache so precise it could have been measured by a compass. My oven was a small mouth in a large wall. Mo was in the front row with a thermos. When I looked down I was wearing my father\u2019s overalls, and they fit, and I took that as a kind of blessing you only get once in a life. Someone shouted, \u201cTime,\u201d and I put down my whisk and woke, the word ringing, neither threat nor promise, just the fact of the hour.\n\nMorning came again, and I did what I always do: I made tea. I fed Marmalade. I read the email one more time to be sure I had not stitched the whole thing together from sleep. Then I went for a walk by the canal. The toe of my boot hit a stone and I nearly went in and laughed in the face of the water as if the water were a person who had told me a rude joke. A man with a hat like a collapsed cake nodded. I nodded back. My phone buzzed in my pocket and I thought of turning it off, and I knew already that this would be the shape of the coming days\u2014baking, writing, answering people, telling the truth more often than not.\n\nNo one warned me that the first yes would require a thousand tiny yeses. But then again, no one warned me that I would come to love the next half hour as if it were an object I could hold.\n\nWhen I got home, there was a package on my step. Inside: a whisk. An extravagant one. A note that read, in Mo\u2019s handwriting, Because I\u2019ll want my old one back. Don\u2019t argue with your mother. I laughed and sent her a photograph of the whisk held aloft, as if I had pulled it from a stone. She sent back a sticker of a crown. Rani texted to say I should practice under pressure and offered to ring my doorbell at random shouting, \u201cYou have thirty seconds!\u201d\n\nI stood at the kitchen table with my notebook open and my hands empty and thought, all right then, all right, come on, let\u2019s do this. The kettle popped and hissed. Someone outside started a car that did not want to be started. A child on a scooter shrieked with joy and then, abruptly, sorrow. The day arranged itself at the window like a show I was ready to watch and to interrupt and to make, somehow, my own.",

                              "content": "I did not start with the braid. I started with a list and then argued with it like a man on a bus who has just been told the timetable is a suggestion. The list wanted to be sensible. It wanted sturdy nouns, quantities with decimals, methods that would comfort a judge into thinking I had already passed. But I found myself writing things like a seam of quince as if I were planning surgery and then underlining rye until the R looked like a canal loop. Northern Routes did not want me to be tidy. It wanted me to admit that a map is a story and so is a recipe. I tore the page out and stuck it to the cupboard where Marmalade could not skate across it. I made tea as if I could boil the problem into steam.\n\nRani texted a photograph of a sheet of cardboard painted with fat letters. SEB RISES had evolved into SEB RISES OR WE RIOT and then had softened again under her brush to SEB RISES (NO PRESSURE). She had ringed the O in pressure with tiny flames as if the letter were a hob. I told her she was deranged and she sent back a gif of a woman dusting flour over a chandelier. In the group chat Benji suggested I incorporate \"found materials,\" by which he meant little square poems cut into the crust, and Claire said that would get me disqualified, and Richard replied with a line of train names that read like a psalm. I put my phone face down and took out a bowl that had belonged to Mo's mother and had a chip the shape of an ear. It made a sound when you tapped it that was neither full nor empty, and my grandmother had always said that was the point of good crockery, to teach you there is something between.\n\nI began with parkin because it felt like an exam in respect. I scalded the oatmeal and smelled the moment the treacle decided to stop being sullen and yield. Ginger went in and a measure of black pepper so tiny I pretended it was an accident even though I wanted the heat. I had quince in a bowl that the woman at the market had sold me with an apology for their bruises and a compliment for my scarf as if one cancelled out the other. I could have driven to the supermarket, but Mo had said Bury, and when Mo tells you to go somewhere, some part of you ties your laces and goes as if she is the weather. The day after the email I had walked through that market and brushed shoulders with men who had bought the same brand of socks for thirty years, and I had let my hands hover over a heap of saffron so bright it might have been illegal. The spice merchant had said the word Iran softly as if the syllables were glass and I had promised to treat the threads like royalty. I bought tea in a packet with a boat on the front and caraway seeds that got into the seams of my pocket and turned up in my change.\n\nI stewed the quince with a sliver of lemon and a tablespoon of the tea and watched the pieces soften as if the fruit had decided to be generous. The plan was to line the parkin with a thin band of quince as if it were a road cutting through moorland. I would peel the paper and the cake would show a seam like a history book, and the judges would nod at my restraint and I would pretend not to mind that it was parkin and parkin does not perform. It is a cake that keeps its counsel and improves in the dark, and it is hard to romance a judge with the promise that something will be better in three days when the whole event is calibrated to the minute. I took it out and pressed a finger to the top and it hummed and sank and rose. Marmalade leaped onto a chair and gave me the look she reserves for times when I am unfaithful to her brand of attention.\n\nAt noon Mo arrived with the air of someone who had remembered that she left the iron on and then remembered that she no longer owns an iron. She hung her new coat on the back of a chair with a flourish and moved straight to the kettle with the instinct of a woman who had not walked into a kitchen without making a drink since she was nineteen. The coat was green and had a hood that could have sheltered a family. She had pinned an enamel badge to the pocket with a tiny drawing of a tram. She held up the whisk in both hands as if she expected me to feign astonishment and then pretended to be offended when I didn't pretend. We arranged slices of experimental parkin on a plate and she said nothing for two bites and then said, in full, \"It's moody,\" and I felt absurdly proud of a square of sugar being accused of having a temperament.\n\n\"Moody is not a category on the judging sheet,\" I said, even though I hadn't seen a judging sheet and doubted such a thing existed outside my anxiety.\n\n\"It should be,\" she said. \"It's very northern to respect a food that can't be rushed and has a face like it's about to tell you a cautionary tale. This is good. It's maybe a touch wet. Do you want me to be tactful or useful?\"\n\n\"Useful, always.\"\n\n\"Then your quince seam is fat. Your ginger is handsome. Your top is dark in a way that makes me fancy it with butter and yet I know that would be blasphemy. And if you bring me a cup of tea I won't have to say anything about the fact that your oven runs hotter on the left.\"\n\nRani would have called Mo a national resource and then tried to recruit her. I made the tea and she turned the mug in her hands as if it were a little planet. We planned. The parkin would be made two days in advance and sealed as if it had secrets. The showstopper would be a braid because I could not resist a chance to tie stories into knots. I took out the saffron and let the filaments fall into warm milk and watched the liquid change its mind about the colour of itself. Rye and white flour together, cardamom and honey, a little orange zest like a borrowed sunshine. I drew an oval and turned it into a map with my pen. Three plaits for the canal and the ship canal and the river. Seeds pressed into the braids to mark the locks. A glaze of black tea and sugar to give a lacquer that would read as rain. On the side, little rolls shaped like milestones, filled with quince and caraway like you might find a handful of secrets in a pocket.\n\nMo did not say, it's too much, which is the sentence I am both afraid of and grateful for when someone loves me. She said, \"One thing at a time,\" and then she said, \"Don't overcomplicate what you can make beautiful with your hands.\"\n\nI practised without the mixer because Shivani wrote back with a list that read like a teacher's email in a year that had turned schooling inside out. They would have stand mixers but there might be electrical issues and the brief had a line about robustness. The ovens were calibrated but we were warned that one corner of the room had a draught. We would have ninety minutes alone on our showstopper after the technical challenge that we would not know until the morning. Could we bring our own spices, labelled; our own tins, as long as we didn't use them to hide a second cake; our own aprons, as long as the apron did not advertise anything except our worst habits. There would be hand gel and the cameras would be discreet in the way that anything can be discreet when it has a red light. We were to arrive with proof of a test taken at a time that made sense, and if we felt unwell we were to tell someone and be loved from a distance.\n\nI stood at the table and kneaded and told myself stories about the men and women who had kneaded before me and I let my shoulders burn until sweat ran down my spine. My father had tied ropes and loops without looking, had made a lark's head out of nothing, had once made me a little ladder out of string and explained that sometimes the ladder has to be there before you know you need it. I braided and unbraided and Muldoon from next door knocked because somehow dough has a knock, a polite thud that tells old men that young men might be doing something worth interrupting. He is not called Muldoon. His name is Mr. Halley, and he is a widow who wears a hat no matter the weather and says things like \"the nineteen eighty-six winter was a proper winter,\" but when I moved in Mo called him Muldoon for an afternoon and he has been Muldoon ever since.\n\n\"Smells like commitment,\" he said, standing on the threshold and peering around as if he might catch out my cleanliness in a lie.\n\n\"It smells like needing to practise.\"\n\n\"Same thing,\" he said. \"I used to teach lads to sit their hands. You have to learn to look at something without touching it. You look and you wait and then you know.\"\n\n\"What did you teach them to operate?\"\n\n\"Engines,\" he said, and then, \"trams. I had one boy who minded the brakes like a mother and one boy who liked to see how fast the handle would spin. You'll forgive me for thinking you are the brakes.\"\n\n\"I'll accept that,\" I said, because more often than not I am the brakes. \"Do you want to taste parkin?\"\n\n\"Does the Pope have a hat,\" he said, and then proceeded to tell me, as if I had asked, about a driver who had taken a corner too fast and had been forgiven by a city that likes to pretend it is made of right angles. He tapped the parkin with one finger and nodded and said, \"Don't cut the seam too wide,\" and then insisted that I take a painting from his hall that had belonged to his wife. It was a watercolour of the aqueduct at Barton and you could tell which way the wind was going by the way the painter had chosen to leave the paper white. I said no twice and yes once and he left with a wave that could have been a blessing or a stretch.\n\nAt the library the next day Rani staged what she called a \"controlled panic.\" She had borrowed the kitchen at the community centre by pretending she was going to host a workshop about soup, and then she had set a timer and told me I had to bake the braid from start to finish with only what I could carry in a bag. She banged on the door at intervals and shouted instructions like a benign general. Claire and Benji and Richard sat at a long table and pretended to be judges, which meant they alternated between saying things like, \"You've got twenty minutes, can we see a finish?\" and taking photographs for social media with their tongues in their cheeks. My dough rose with all the magnetism of a brick. The draught did not help. My hands, which at home had become orchestras, became forks. When the timer went and Rani did an air horn noise that echoed off the tiles, my braid was the right shape but the wrong spirit and I felt tears press my eyes in a way that reminded me of being twelve and accidentally kicking a ball into a conservatory.\n\nRani turned the oven off and turned me round by my shoulders and said, \"Look at me. We do not cry about dough in a room with a folding table. We cry about dead pets and lost loves and the time we left our book on the bus and never saw the end. We do not cry about a practice. Say it. This is a practice.\"\n\n\"This is a practice,\" I said, and the phrase was both a spell and a scolding.\n\nClaire cut into the braid and made appreciative noises like a woman who had wanted to say something far worse but had decided to let me be fragile. Richard suggested I reduce the honey by a nerve and increase the caraway, because he liked a bake that talked to him as it went down, and Benji said, \"It looks like an actual map,\" in a tone that made me believe there was at least one person in the world who would eat bread because it was shaped like a city. We made a list of adjustments and Rani offered me a napkin and then refused to give it to me until I said \"I am magnificent even when I'm under-proved,\" which I said with minimal sarcasm. We cleaned the counters because the woman who had lent Rani the key had asked her to treat the place \"as if the Queen was popping in for a bowl of stew,\" and even though there was no queen and no stew, we did what we were told.\n\nOn the evening news the storm had a name. I have never trusted storms with names because they feel like guests at a party who will arrive with a bottle of something and then announce they are moving in. The presenter stood in front of a map that had been sketched by an optimist and sounded like a man who had prepared for crisis by filling his freezer. I turned the volume down and wrote until my head felt like it had been worn smooth by a tide. In the book my protagonist finally touched the lemon tree and found it hot to the skin even in winter, and that seemed like a pretty flagrant metaphor and I let it stand because sometimes you need to be obvious to yourself.\n\nLate, the lights flickered and then went out, and the flat shifted into the kind of dark that makes you aware of the bones of your face. Marmalade, who had previously been certain the storm was beneath her, sat up and decided to confess that she was a mammal. I found candles with the air of a man rewarded for his hoarding and lit them and watched the walls become adolescent again. The dough in the bowl, midway up, sighed as if the storm had knocked on the door and told it a rude joke. I covered it with a damp tea towel and a folded jumper and improvised a proving drawer next to the radiator that had the decency to keep working. I sent Mo a message to tell her not to walk out in the dark to look at the fairy lights on the bridge and she replied with a string of emojis that looked like a small orchestra. Halley, through the wall, sang two verses of The Leaving of Liverpool and then stopped, which was more disconcerting than if he had carried on.\n\nIn the morning the storm had shoved our town into a shape we recognised and resented. Bins were in the positions bins take when they have rehearsal for a revolution. The man with the fairy lights had lost three and tied two more in a knot that I could not untangle even with my eyes. The canal was fat with attitude. I wanted to stay inside and make the kitchen a church, but Shivani had arranged a pre-final call for all the competitors, and I had decided to be the kind of person who showed up for his own life. We joined a grid of faces, nine of us, and all of us arranged our expressions into that awkward friendliness you see at a party where someone promised you there would be snacks and then lied. There was a woman in a purple cardigan with a plate of jam tarts on a chair behind her, and a man in a vest I could not forgive who told us he was a beekeeper three times. There were two young men who shared a screen and elbowed each other like brothers or lovers and laughed whenever anyone said the word \"laminate,\" and a woman about my age with an apron printed with hot air balloons and a care in her face that made me want to be on her team.\n\n\"Welcome,\" Shivani said, as if she had just arrived in our houses with a basket. She talked us through the timings and the choreography and reassured us that the judges would not, in fact, be looking for blood. She told us there would be a camera that stayed with each of us quietly, and that if we felt it breathing, to tell it to mind its business. She told us that the theme meant what we made it mean, and that she had seen past winners be as literal as gravy and as fanciful as night. The purple cardigan woman asked if we could bring our own jam, and the beekeeping vest man asked if he could garnish his bake with edible flowers from his garden, and one of the elbowing men asked if it was okay to cry on camera, and Shivani said it was okay to be honest as long as we didn't swear. He typed a line of asterisks and everyone seemed to sigh with relief.\n\nAfter the call, the kitchen felt new, as if it had been visited by a civic inspector and found in good order. I kneaded and braided and split the loaves into lengths so I could practise the oven shuffle. I set up a fan in the corner to fake the draught and I spoke out loud because I needed to hear my own timing. Ten minutes and rotate, five minutes and brush, fifteen minutes and check a bottom with my knuckle which I would inevitably describe later as knocking on a door. I made my hands remember where everything lived without looking. I hid the honey so I wouldn't drown the loaf in a bath of apologies. I made the quince seam narrow, a ribbon instead of a road, a line of gold where the knife would find it.\n\nAt some point in the afternoon I caught sight of myself in the kettle and saw my father, which was unfair of kettles and fathers both. I had his mouth when I concentrated and the way my jaw took a stand when it decided to be good. I stood with my back to the counter and ate a slice of the second attempt and tried to decide whether the parkin liked me. Bread is forgiving. It wants to be eaten. Parkin wants to be left alone until it forgives you for making it. I wrapped it in paper and slid it under a shelf as if I were tucking a child under a bed and told it a story about the time a baker had once sold out of buns in a little market and gone home and cried because he didn't know how to be as good as people needed him to be.\n\nIn the evening, Mo brought stew because she said storms are an excuse to be nineteenth-century, and we ate with our elbows on the table while Marmalade performed the long con of being a cat who likes gravy. We talked about my father and then moved him gently to the corner of the room where he always sits in our conversations, and then we let him watch us without insisting he say anything. We made a plan for the morning of the final that involved leaving too early, because Mo has a philosophy that begins and ends with being early enough to break something and fix it before anyone knows. She laid out my apron and shook her head at a stain that she said told the story of a pear cobbler and I said she was a forensic genius. She put the whisk in my bag and told me not to let Rani take it to use as a baton. She told me to sleep and to ignore any dreams involving collapsing ovens or moustaches shaped like question marks. She told me that whatever happened I had already given the world a good loaf and a moodily decent parkin and a day, and a day is not nothing.\n\nI lay in bed and did not sleep. I listened to an old podcast about sourdough as if I were revising for a test in breathing. I composed the first lines of a scene in my novel in which a man who thinks he is made of winter realises he has been summer all along, and then I laughed at myself because sometimes my earnestness is the most northern thing about me. I counted the objects I would lay out on the table in the Glassworks as if they were lucky coins: the apron, the bowl, the jar of cardamom, the honey in its heavy glass, the packet of saffron, the tin with the secret paper lining for the parkin, the brush that had lived a previous life as my father's paintbrush and that I had cleaned so thoroughly you could only see its past if you were an archaeologist. I considered texting Rani to tell her to cancel her sign because it would be too loud next to my heart, and I did not because I wanted someone to shout when the world went shy.\n\nMorning found me before the alarm as if it were afraid to lose me. I made tea and pretended to drink it with serenity and then remembered serenity is a theatre and I have never auditioned. I packed the bag and then unpacked it because I had not put the saffron in, and then repacked it and added a packet of raisins as if there might be a child at the venue who required a snack. I forgot my phone and went back for it. I petted Marmalade and told her she would be in charge of the perimeter while I was gone, and she turned her back in a way that made me feel both scolded and forgiven. The wind had given up and gone to bother another town. The canal was glassy and sulking. The fairy lights were still out, because it was morning. I locked the door and checked the handle twice because some days you have to make sure a boundary stays a boundary.\n\nOn the tram I recognised my own adrenalin in other people. There was a man in a suit pinching the bridge of his nose, a girl in a school blazer reading a book with her finger moving under the line, a woman in a tracksuit holding a bunch of keys like she might use them to conduct. I stood by the door and watched my reflection ripple and decided I was a person on his way to try his best. Sometimes a sentence like that is all you can bear, and sometimes it is everything. I texted Mo to tell her I had boarded and she replied with a photograph of a thermos and three mince pies arranged as if for inspection. I texted Rani to say if she brought the sign I would die and she replied that death is a small price to pay for solidarity. I watched the city open and close like a throat. I let the morning take me, and I thought about what it means to make something and then let it be seen.\n\nCastlefield was bluer than I had expected. The sky had found a hole in itself and poured. The Glassworks, when I reached it, looked like a building that had been taught to be polite. It had steel ribs and old brick and a doorway that wanted to tell you not to be silly. Outside, Shivani stood with a clipboard and a scarf that made her look like a flag, and she raised her hand and my name came out of her mouth tidy and correct. Mo walked towards me with the stride she reserves for events in which she has to pretend she is not the mother, and she managed, for three seconds, to be demure before whispering in my ear that she had given Richard from the group directions to a car park that may or may not exist. Behind her, Rani lifted the sign and then lowered it and then lifted it again as if it were a bird she was coaxing into flight. I breathed in air that smelled of wet slate and coffee and the particular electricity of people who have chosen to be in a room where they might fail gloriously. I picked up my bag. I took a step toward the door and did not think of anything except dough.",

The floor had a gloss that made even my boots stand to attention. Steel tables stood in two rows with enough space between them to prevent territorial wars, each one laid with a cutting board, a set of knives with their blades tucked under guards like sleeping fish, a stack of bowls in graduating sizes, and a laminated sheet with our names as if we were about to sit an exam. The ovens were built into a long wall and blinked an even red at us, a row of small, patient planets. Above them, a gangway ran the length of the room, and beyond a glass partition the audience seats stepped up in shallow tiers. Someone had thought very hard about how to make this old bone of a building feel like a church of competence.\n\nShivani ticked my name, clipped a green wristband around my arm and pointed me to my station with a smile that said she had already put out several small fires and would do it again without complaining. I found my bench near one end of the row, close enough to the corner to sense the seam in the air where warm met cold. If I leaned to the right, a draft trailed its hand along my shoulder, polite but insistent, like a friend reminding you that you have somewhere to be. I put my bag down and unpacked the things I was allowed to bring: the jar of cardamom, my small tin of saffron with its ridiculous felt lining, my own wooden spoon because sometimes you need a familiar handle, and the brush that had once painted a skirting board in our old house and now glazed bread with tea. A camera operator materialised at the edge of my vision, his lens blinking at chest height. He introduced himself as Ayo and explained he\u2019d be with me all day, and that I should pretend he was a coat stand until he spoke and revealed he was a person. He had kind eyes above his mask and a habit of rocking back on his heels as if measuring the room for a door.\n\nThe other bakers assembled like the first day of a workplace where everyone had accidentally worn their personality on their clothes. Purple Cardigan had introduced herself on the call as Hester and in person she had a face that had practised every version of patience. She nodded at me and balanced a plate of jam tarts on the edge of her station because some people travel with their proof. The beekeeper in the vest was called Alfie and he wore the kind of smile that had got him through a hundred conversations about stings. He kissed the tips of his fingers and raised them to the ceiling when he saw the bank of ovens, and I liked him even though he used the word \u201cnectar\u201d like it owed him money. The two who elbowed each other were Saj and Luke and the way they said each other\u2019s names had a decades-old bruise of affection in it. The woman with the balloon apron was Jas, shorter than she\u2019d looked on the screen, with a neat halo of hair and a way of aligning her mise en place that made me want to hand her my life and say, tidy it. We did the British shuffle of smiles over our masks and half-waves and the unspoken contract to help if someone\u2019s tray hit the floor.\n\nUp on the gangway the audience took their places at a careful distance, a scatter of coats and knitted hats and eyes. Rani slid in next to Mo with the sign folded in half like a secret that was trying not to be a secret. Mo had her thermos and two mince pies in a napkin and the green hood of the new coat tucked under her chair like a well-behaved pet. She took a photograph of me and, because she is not cruel, did not shout my name across the room, but it was on her face anyway. I waved in the small way you wave when you have already decided this is too much attention and you will manage it by pretending to be an understated sort of person until your own heart believes you.\n\nShivani stepped forward and introduced the judges, and for a brief second it was like the dream had loaned me a detail. Elsie Dacre had the straight back of a woman who refused to apologise for flour and a cardigan the colour of boiled sweets. She ran a bakery in Rochdale that had survived the fashions of three decades by treating fashion like a draft and moving the cakes away from it. Mei-Lin Patel carried her sleeves pushed up as if at any second she might reach into sugar and draw out a swan; she had a patisserie in Ancoats that people queued for even in rain that felt like revenge. The moustache belonged to Crispin Holt, a food historian from a corner of the world where food had been studied more than it had been eaten, and his tweed was so persuasive that I believed he might produce a footnote if I shook him. They took their places behind a calm wooden bench, and Shivani, who could have coaxed a confession out of a stone, told us to face the ovens and breathe.\n\n\u201cFor your technical,\u201d Mei-Lin said, the word making my stomach tilt as if we had driven too fast over a small hill, \u201cwe\u2019d like you to make twelve individual Manchester tarts. You\u2019ll find a list of ingredients and a recipe with\u2026 guidance.\u201d She let the pause sit there and smiled with her eyes. \u201cShortcrust pastry, raspberry jam, set custard, desiccated coconut on top. No banana.\u201d\n\nA ripple ran through the room that was half laughter and half grief. Hester made a small noise that might have been protest on behalf of the school canteen. Crispin leaned into his microphone like a man about to argue that the banana was a twentieth-century aberration and had no place in civilisation.\n\n\u201cTwo hours,\u201d Elsie said, which was the sort of mercy that carried a threat. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking for crisp pastry, no soggy bottoms, a custard that doesn\u2019t sulk, and a top that says you know what you\u2019re doing with coconut. Off you go.\u201d\n\nI have made custard a hundred times in my life and every time it behaves like a lover who needs reassurance. I read the recipe sheet, which gave us times as if time were a thing that belonged to everyone equally, then put it down and talked myself through a plan. Ditch the mixer; the pastry would be better by hand and faster if I trusted my fingers. Cold butter, rubbed in until it looked like it had forgotten once being a block. A light hand with the water, a rest that would have to be a gesture rather than a meditation. I weighed the flour, counted the breaths between cutting the fat and bringing the whole mess together, and tried not to think about the camera that might be turning my concentration into a story. Ayo stood back and hummed the smallest fragment of a tune, which would have annoyed me in any other kitchen and here made the world expand. We each had a drawer marked \u201cfridge\u201d that felt like a joke until it whirred into life and proved itself useful. I slid the dough in and pretended I couldn\u2019t hear the draft whispering that I ought to be doing more.\n\nBlind bake. The words would always sound counterintuitive to me, like \u201ccivil war\u201d or \u201chealthy char.\u201d I rolled the dough thinner than my nerves wanted and pressed it into the tart tins sitting like patient coins on my tray. Prick, line, beans. The oven door bit at me with its heat and I thought of the cold air I\u2019d left behind on the towpath and felt a small, ridiculous gratitude for the fact that we can make our own weather. The custard in the pan was milk and eggs and sugar and courage, and I stirred until the motion became the point and the whisk drew a figure of eight like a signature. No banana, I told myself like a mantra, no banana, and saw in the corner of my eye Alfie look as if he had been waiting his whole life to defy that instruction and then decide he did not want to be a martyr for fruit.\n\nI turned, three turns, rotated the tins, knocked a knuckle against a case to hear a sound that would tell me what to do next. The draft moved across my cheek and I moved the bowl to a warmer spot and blinked hard because steam is sometimes a substitute for tears. When the beans came out, the cases looked as they ought, which is to say both mean and promising, and I brushed them with a wash of egg to seal the deal and slid them back in for the briefest of second acts. The jam was the sort of red that tells a child a story and I spread it thin because nobody wanted a tart that looked like it had gone to war. I poured custard and the wobble gave me a sermon about humility. Hester caught my eye and made a face that said her custard had decided to remain liquid as an act of principle, and I wanted, with an ache that surprised me, to tell her she was doing fine.\n\nWe stood, briefly, fifteen of us in a room advertised as an event, and watched something set that we could not hurry. Ayo leaned in and asked me to talk through what I had done as if I had done anything except not fall apart, and I said words about ratios and instincts and my father\u2019s habit of tapping things and waiting, and Mei-Lin paused by my bench and did not say anything condemning, which was as much praise as I could cope with. The coconut snowed with a pleasing sort of greed. I lifted a tart and the custard held and the pastry stayed where it was supposed to be, brown at the edges like a sensible hedge. One of them sank, a small betrayal, and I moved it to the back of the tray, which is a ridiculous sacrifice because the judges are as familiar with that trick as they are with heat. I presented my twelve in two tidy rows like a man who knows he cannot hide his flaws and instead dares you to love them.\n\nJudging the technical meant being watched while you tried not to want to be liked and failing. We stood to one side while the three of them moved down the line, knives cutting clean little domes of judgement, and I tried not to let my eyes latch on to anyone\u2019s face for too long in case I borrowed their joy or their dread by mistake. When they reached mine, Crispin held one up to his nose and sniffed like a fox. Elsie tapped the base and nodded, just once, as if acknowledging that the earth did, indeed, rotate. Mei-Lin cut and lifted, the custard stayed conversational and she said, in a voice that could have been meant for me or for the tart, \u201cGood set.\u201d The jam was perhaps a mark too thin. The coconut was perhaps a whisper too enthusiastic. But there was no banana and we all relaxed as if a small cultural war had been avoided.\n\nWe lined up for the reveal of the technical rankings, numbers written on cards that had been slid under plates for the cameras to have their moment. The twins came first because their custard had the unflappable quality of men who have never been late to a bus, and Hester crept to third with a pastry that had a mother\u2019s genius for crispness, and I landed in fifth, which in my heart translated to, you do not embarrass the room, and also, yes, you could have gone easier on the coconut. Alfie was seventh and took it with a grin that made it impossible to be cross, and Jas, who had been quiet all morning, looked at her fourth place as if it were a secret she intended to keep to herself.\n\nShivani gave us ten minutes to reset and in that time my hands learned how to be mine again. I wiped the bench and laid out the things that would anchor the next hour and a half: the flour in its bag folded over to keep it neat; the yeast in its small jar like the good idea it could be; the milk in a jug that I warmed with a glance at the corner of the room that had decided to be winter. I checked the saffron as if it were a small creature that might make a run for it. I brushed a speck of jam from the edge of my station because I had the sense, as I often did, that leaving the wrong red in the wrong place would hex the day. Ayo leaned in and told me my mum had cried a very specific kind of cry at the end of the technical that had set off a chain reaction in three strangers, and I nodded and did not look up.\n\n\u201cFor your showstopper,\u201d Elsie said when we were called back to attention, \u201cwe want something that makes sense of our theme. Northern Routes. Sweet or savoury. Tell us a story, and make it edible.\u201d\n\nIt was like being given permission to be as sincere as I wanted. I tipped the flour into the bowl and added rye like a suggestion rather than a command. Milk warmed, saffron turned its flag, cardamom crushed under the flat of a knife and released that green-dark perfume that had become a part of my house. Honey went in and told me not to apologise with it later. The yeast woke and proved it by blooming like gossip. I mixed until the flour confessed and kneaded until the dough stopped complaining. Ninety minutes is an argument with time if you are asking it to be generous. I told myself to trust the muscle memory of my hands more than the part of my head that wanted to compose an essay. The draft tugged at my sleeves like a child and I moved the bowl under the edge of a heat lamp they\u2019d provided for exactly this kind of day. I let my palms hold the bowl like a planet and added warmth with the old, unromantic method of being alive.\n\nThey came to visit as the dough rose. Judges are not there to comfort, but Elsie\u2019s presence had the effect of someone putting a hand on your briefcase and telling you you\u2019d packed enough. I explained the braid, the three strands for the canal, the ship canal and the river, the seeds pressed in for locks, the black tea glaze for rain, the quince seam that would run the length of one plait like a road you could walk by taste. Mei-Lin asked how I would keep the quince where it belonged, and I told her about reducing it to a paste and piping it in rather than spooning it and letting it wander like a pilgrim. Crispin stroked his moustache like a pet and said something about heavy symbolism, and I let myself smile because if there is a thing I will be accused of, let it be that I tried to say something and then said it again with seeds.\n\nThe braid is a simple shape and also the most complicated. The three ropes laid out and the way the wrist learns that over-under-over is less about pattern and more about kindness. I rolled, I flattened, I piped a thin gold line down the centre of one strand and pressed the edges up to meet and hold it as if I were tucking in a child who wriggles. I worked faster than my instincts liked and slower than the clock wanted. Saj and Luke had decided on shortbreads layered into a map you could eat with rectangles for stations and I loved them for it without being able to tell them so. Hester rolled out suet dough for a roly-poly that made sense of railway halts and was sewing in dark jam like a seamstress. Alfie had made a honeycomb ring and was threading marzipan bees along a sugar road, and I prayed that his bees would not be judged for their cheer. Jas laminated pastry like someone folding a letter they were going to send without opening again, and her bench had an order that asked me to stand up straighter.\n\nThe draught took a bite at the left edge of my bench and my braid, once shaped and laid, rose politely at the far end and then sulked at the near. I tilted the tray, which felt like performing a magic trick in front of an engineer, and then I swallowed my pride and asked Ayo to ask Shivani if I could move the proof to the other side for five minutes. He went to ask and came back with a shake of his head, and I had the odd surge of gratitude for rules, because sometimes you need something to push against. I inverted a metal bowl over the fragile end and trapped a pocket of warmth that sent the dough a note. When it had swollen in a way that made the slice of me that is a child feel relief, I slid it into the oven and shut the door and told myself not to look for five minutes. A person can learn to look without touching, and then to trust without staring, and then to know without needing to narrate every act. Five minutes came, then ten, and I turned and brushed with tea and sugar until the surface shone like wet tarmac.\n\nRani held the sign up once, briefly, the letters of my name like a thing made of rope. Mo was talking to a woman with a hat pinned at an angle that suggested she had dressed for television in the sense that a person dresses for leaving the house for the first time after an illness. I could see the way Mo\u2019s mouth went when she was being fierce for someone else\u2019s sake, and I had a sudden image of her explaining the difference between patience and passivity to a stranger who had just said her daughter ought to calm down. I thought of my father without deciding to, the way you think of the anchor of a boat when you feel the boat float, and I was grateful again for the soft vulgarity of yeast.\n\nThere was a moment, as there always is, when the braid looked like it would burn on the outside before its inner self was ready to be admired. I knocked the underside and listened for the sound that is not unlike laughter. I rotated and made a small adjustment that seemed like pretending to control weather, and a seam at the junction of two strands opened in a thin smile and let the quince show. I told myself not to panic because a seam is not a wound, and I pinched gently and brushed the place with tea to glue it to itself. I reached for the caraway and pressed seeds in along a straight run as if I could convince anyone that they had always belonged there. The little milestones\u2014rolls wrapped around thumb and forefinger and filled with a smear of quince like a secret you tell a friend and not a crowd\u2014went in for their short bake and came out browned as if they had been out in the weather and liked it.\n\nTime was called by a person with a voice that knew how to land. We had thirty seconds by one count and a lifetime by another. I lifted the braid to the board I had brought that looked enough like a map to be embarrassing if the bread had not justified the theatre, and I laid the milestones along one side with gaps because I have always been suspicious of perfection. I wiped the smear of tea from the edge of the board and stepped back and only then noticed that I had not breathed properly for several minutes. Ayo made a little sound that might have been a yes or might have been a yawn and in either case felt like kindness. Saj whispered \u201cnice\u201d at a volume that would have gotten him in trouble in a library, and Hester patted her roly-poly like a cat. The room exhaled, which is always the moment when you remember the thing you forgot, and then remembered that this time you had not.\n\nJudging the showstopper is pageantry and it is also the awkward intimacy of a stranger telling you who they think you are. They began at the far end and worked towards me, and I watched Crispin\u2019s eyebrows and Elsie\u2019s hands and the tilt of Mei-Lin\u2019s head and tried to remind myself that today was not the sum of me. Alfie\u2019s bees looked ridiculous and therefore perfect, and Elsie told him his honey had been heavy-handed in the dough and he took it like a man who knows the difference between love and flattery. Jas had made a series of small laminated parcels that opened to reveal spices and fruit that told the route of her grandmother\u2019s kitchen to her own, and when she cut one the sound of the layers could have paid rent. They told her she had done a delicate thing without needing applause and she nodded like a person who saves her crying for later.\n\nWhen they reached me the braid had set into itself and the glaze had caught the light like a street after rain, which was a luck I had asked for and been given. Elsie pressed the edge and approved of the colour without saying she approved of the colour, which is to say she didn\u2019t frown. Crispin bent to read the caraway road as if it were a text and then raised his chin at me, and I spoke the sentence I had rehearsed in which I described the three strands, the locks, the glaze, the quince, the rye, and the way the canals had kept us together when the weather was ugly. He cut and the knife met a resistance that meant the crust had thought about me, and he lifted a slice and the seam of quince sat where I had asked it to sit. Mei-Lin took a piece and her eyes did a thing that I couldn\u2019t translate and I realised that sometimes you don\u2019t get to be fluent in everyone\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cThe crumb\u2019s a touch tight,\u201d she said, and she touched the dough with the tip of one finger like a pianist checking the instrument. \u201cThe draught did you no favours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt it,\u201d I said, which was both a joke and a confession.\n\n\u201cThe flavour\u2019s considered,\u201d Elsie said. \u201cRye can be a brag. Here it\u2019s a story.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou like a metaphor,\u201d Crispin said, as if accusing me of something he couldn\u2019t decide to forgive, and then he added, \u201cbut it\u2019s not heavy. It eats better than it sounds.\u201d He put a small piece of the milestone roll in his mouth and made a face that suggested surprise. \u201cQuince and caraway,\u201d he said. \u201cI would not have said yes on paper. I\u2019m saying yes now.\u201d\n\nThey moved on and I stood very straight and told my hands not to touch my apron. The twins had made biscuits like a map you could break apart, and it was charming and the kind of clever that needs a frame, and the frame here was the word \u201cNorthern\u201d and we all felt it. Hester\u2019s roly-poly looked like a station buffet and tasted like a walk after rain. She had used suet without apology and Jam like a route. The beekeeper\u2019s ring had generous sweetness and a tilt towards summer that the judges did not entirely encourage in a room that was thinking about grit. We lined up again and the voices from above became the hush a room makes when it wants to be fair.\n\nShivani took the microphone not because she enjoyed the power but because somebody has to say the thing that makes several hearts fall and several hearts skip. She thanked the sponsors and the venue and the volunteers who had wiped things with a thoroughness that would have been comic in any other year. She told the audience that clapping had to be done without standing up, which produced a wave of half-laughter that made me love my town. She looked at Elsie, who looked at Mei-Lin, who looked at Crispin, who looked at his moustache because some men require props for courage. It was as if a chorus of birds had to agree on a tune and then decide who would sing the first line.\n\n\u201cWe have a winner,\u201d Elsie said, and the way she said it made it sound like the winner would be a cake rather than a person, which felt right. \u201cFor a bake that told a story without turning it into homework, that tasted like layers and read like a route we recognised, and that was, not to put too fine a point on it, technically sound.\u201d\n\nI glanced down the line because there is a part of me that has always looked away at the crucial moment, like a lover who doesn\u2019t want to see a flinch. Jas stood with her hands clasped, eyes on the table edge, as if she had been taught long ago not to ask a room for anything. When they said her name she looked up with the specific disbelief of someone who is used to carrying practical things and being thanked only by the absence of complaint. Saj slapped Luke\u2019s shoulder and whooped and Hester clapped the way experienced women clap when the point has been made. I clapped too, loud enough to make my palms sting because there are moments when bitterness would be simpler and you choose not to be simple.\n\nThey gave two commendations, which felt like a word designed to be pinned to a blazer. One for Hester, whose jam-to-dough ratio had made Elsie nod as if she had heard a well-argued point. One for me, for flavours that had chosen each other with deliberation, and for a concept that had not tripped me, even though it could have. I nodded and accepted the paper circle with its ribbon as if I were collecting a certificate in Year Six for citizenship, and I surprised myself by not wanting to make a joke. Alfie came over and hugged me with more shoulder than chest, which is the way men hug when they want to be kind and curated, and he told me he\u2019d had a banana in his bag like a lucky rabbit\u2019s foot and left it there out of respect, and I told him that showed character.\n\nWhen we were released back into the warm muddle of people and noise, when the cameras blinked their last blink and the ovens went dull and the list of ingredients on my bench looked like the remains of a party, I let myself sit on the edge of my station for the first time all day. Rani arrived with the sign and waved it like a flag at a funeral because she understands tone, and then she propped it against my bench and kissed my forehead with a theatricality she reserves for moments she wants me to remember later with a smile rather than with an ache. Mo approached slower, as if walking through a new room and checking the floorboards. She put her hands on either side of my face and did not speak for a minute that lasted long enough to fit in several past versions of me, and then she said, \u201cYou told them a thing and they heard you,\u201d and I realised that this, more than a ribbon, was the prize I had needed.\n\nWe wrapped the braid carefully and Mo took half for the neighbour who would later knock twice and pretend not to be moved and then be moved. I slid the parkin from its paper and cut squares as if I were cutting a deck for a trick, and I slipped two into a napkin for Elsie, who said, only partially under her breath, that people forget a cake that makes them cry on the day and remember the one that improves when they are alone. Jas and I swapped slices like children with stickers, and her pastry held a whisper of cardamom that made me want to sit and listen. Ayo told me he had never met a camera that behaved so well and I told him it was because it had spent the day near dough. Shivani pressed a hand to my arm in that way people in charge do when they have to move on to the next thing and want you to know you were part of this one. Rani took the whisk from my bag and used it as a sceptre and Mo took it back with an expression that invented a new subsection of disapproval.\n\nLater, when the room had been given back to its metal and its floor, when we had folded our aprons into ourselves and slipped out into the air that had been waiting, we stood a moment on the wet steps and watched the city breathe. The canals showed their backs in the late light and the fairy lights on the footbridge at home had been persuaded to behave. I carried my bag and my commendation and a roll of tape that had somehow made itself mine. Mo linked her arm through mine and said we would drop bread at Mr. Halley\u2019s and then go to hers and eat something that did not require judgement, and I said she had just described chips. Rani walked backwards, delivering her debrief as if I were an athlete who needed to hear he had legs, and she told me I had kept my brioches and my metaphors in line and therefore belonged to my own day. I promised to bring the sign back to her flat because even the most ambitious cardboard needs a rest.\n\nOn the tram home a boy in a red hoodie wore his medal on the outside of his coat and held his mouth in that way that means you cannot speak because your throat has decided to be brave. A woman read a paperback with cracked plastic on its cover and breathed through a laugh and then checked herself as if laughter had to be rationed. A man asked another man what stop this was and the other man said he didn\u2019t know because some days you can ride the whole line and still be between. I leaned my head against the window and felt the train make its sibilant way and thought that I had done the oddest and most ordinary thing. I had made the morning into something someone else could taste. I had looked at a map and then made it with my hands. I had said yes and found that, inside it, there were other yeses, small and mean and generous and necessary.\n\nAt Mo\u2019s, we unwrapped the remainder of the braid and ate it with butter we said we didn\u2019t need. Marmalade was affronted by the smell of other places on my coat and then forgave me when I produced a piece of parkin as if I were paying tribute to a small, furred tax collector. We put the ribbon on the mantel, where it made the other objects look as if they had been waiting for company. Mo told me the names of every person she had spoken to in the audience and what they did and what they thought and who they had loved, because she has a way of extracting biography with the gentleness of a dentist. She told me that when I stood with my head tipped to listen to the judges she had seen my father, and I told her a kettle had done the same to me, and we agreed that there are places where the past rises like steam and the trick is not to back away from it.\n\nIn bed that night, the storm having taken its grievance to the next town, I lay on my side and thought about the way the knife had gone through the braid and the way Mei-Lin had pinched the crumb and the way my hands had found their proof without a gadget. The book called to me, a polite cough from the corner, and I wrote with the duvet over my legs and the cat in her doughnut shape at my feet. My protagonist stood at the lemon tree and did not touch it this time. He turned away and walked along a canal that did not belong to his childhood and watched the water carry a sheen like tea across its back. He passed a boy wearing a medal. He saw a woman holding a whisk as if it were a torch. He kept going, and I kept him company, and the night went with us until it became morning again and the sun put its hand through a torn cloud and found the exact place where flour had been.",

Rani had sent a link with a timestamp to the moment she had lifted the sign and then put it down again and then lifted it with amended bravado, and her message was the sort of exultant that always finds the single hinge in me that needs oil. Mo had written, Make sure you eat a decent breakfast and not just glory, and then, half an hour later, What is glory when you slice it. Marmalade sat on the back of the sofa as if she were supervising a staff of invisible interns and blinked at me with patience that was not patience at all but the knowledge that I would come to my senses and open a tin.\n\nI made tea with the solemnity of a newly sworn juror and watched the stream again until the parts of my body that had been braced eased down into something like ordinary. The braid looked like a thing I had done on purpose and not a thing that had let me do it, which felt like a generous trick of the camera. The comments were primarily people arguing about whether a cake could be moody and someone asking where they could buy quince in Barnsley, and one person saying that you could tell I was a northerner by the way I held my bowl as if it were something that might leave if not loved. I laughed and then felt the warm flush of being seen in a way you do not want to admit you enjoyed.\n\nBy ten the doorbell had received three polite misuses. Mr. Halley knocked once, pretended to carry on down the road, knocked again and then stepped back as if worried I would think him needy. He wore a scarf the colour of pennies and smelled faintly of something medicinal that had been fashionable when buses were orange. I handed him half the braid wrapped in paper like a letter and he held it against his chest in a gesture that made my throat do the nonsense thing. He didn\u2019t talk about the programme or the commendation ribbon that Mo had propped near her clock, because he is the kind of man who thinks fuss should be kept for emergencies and births, but he put his hand on my shoulder with a weight that said he had watched the whole thing and had done some muttering on my behalf.\n\n\u201cI watched a bit,\u201d he said, which in Mr. Halley\u2019s lexicon is a confession of obsession. \u201cYou were neat. That\u2019s half of it. Neat keeps parts from flying off when you change speed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a draught,\u201d I said, because it felt right to blame weather in front of a man who had coaxed vehicles through every version of it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a draught,\u201d he said. \u201cBuildings breathe because people forget to. You did your little bowl trick. Smart. Bridget used to say the aqueduct at Barton taught her that water holds its shape if you ask nicely and build the walls. You can\u2019t stop the wind. You can build your edges.\u201d\n\nHe nodded towards the painting he had given me and I followed the line of his finger to the pale wash where the artist had left the page clean. The white there had a kind of courage. He told me a story about a driver who had memorised the way the wind came off the river at particular bends and had learned to ride it rather than correct it, and he ended, as he often did, with a joke so understated it felt like a proverb. When he left, I stood for a moment with the door shut and held the quiet like a parcel.\n\nShivani\u2019s email slipped into my inbox with the modesty of a librarian closing a window. She thanked us for the day and for not swearing and for being the kind of people who could be told a rule and obey it without being told twice. Then, at the end, there was a paragraph that was both an invitation and a dare. Would I consider writing a small piece for the next issue of Hearth & Home, about the experience of making a route out of flour. The column would sit in a section that used to be called From the Hearth and had been renamed The Long Table by someone in marketing who had not wanted to look the word hearth in the face. It would be part recipe, part reflection, with a photograph if I could persuade a friend to take one in which I did not look like I was apologising for my jug. They could pay me, not extravagantly, but in a way that meant I could buy saffron without bargaining with my conscience.\n\nI did not say yes immediately, because I am a man who sometimes likes to pretend that deliberation is integrity. I read the email twice and then did the thing I always do when the day arrives with an extra coat and I\u2019m not sure how to carry it; I went to the library. The air in there had a civic rectangularity that calmed me. The woman at the desk wore a cardigan that could have solved a small disagreement just by draping it over the participants, and the WHISPER PLEASE sign had been handwritten by someone who loved their own hand. Rani was already at a table, a polka-dot scarf looped twice around her neck like punctuation. She had two coffees and a packet of biscuits that had been on offer in a way that made them taste like victory.\n\n\u201cBefore you say anything, yes,\u201d she said, when I slid into the chair and put my bag down as if it contained a very small, very loud animal. \u201cYes to whatever. Yes to writing it. Yes to pretending you ate only one mince pie yesterday. Yes to getting a decent author photograph where you are not holding a whisk like an apology.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want a recipe with it,\u201d I said, trying to sound hapless and failing. \u201cHalf story, half method.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour whole life is half story, half method. You were literally born to do this. You came out with a list and a metaphor and a small complaint about the lighting.\u201d She leaned in, doing the Rani thing where she made the ridiculous feel like plain sense. \u201cWrite about your dad. Not in a tragic violin way. In a rope-and-knot way. Write about the seam and the locks and you standing there thinking you\u2019re in charge and the canal laughing behind your back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t write my dad into every good thing,\u201d I said, even as I knew I would. \u201cHe\u2019ll get tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll cope,\u201d she said. \u201cMen who put mugs out in the morning can take a little literary wear-and-tear.\u201d\n\nWe worked quietly, as far as Rani works quietly, which is to say she hummed and wrote aggressively and every so often looked up and said, out of nowhere, \u201cYou could call it A Narrow Cut,\u201d and then wrote the words down on her own paper and boxed them twice. I wrote the first lines of the column with my fingers sticky from biscuit crumbs and found that the tone, which had worried me, arrived on its own feet. It wasn\u2019t the voice of my narrator, who was currently sulking in a lemon grove and refusing to turn towards his own plot, and it wasn\u2019t the voice I used when I tried to be authoritative, which always sounded like I\u2019d been given a megaphone by accident. It was the voice I used when I told Mo a story of a small thing becoming large, and when I told Marmalade that the tin would open, and when I told the dough to wait for me. It was relief to find a register that did not ask me to choose between sincerity and wit, because lately everything had felt like a test I had not prepared for.\n\nAt noon a school party invaded, a flock of small coats and bigger questions, and the librarian materialised a courage the size of a bus and persuaded them to enjoy quiet as an activity. One of them broke from the group like a comet and came to our table and looked at my notebook and asked, without preamble, \u201cDo you like cake?\u201d I said yes because I am a citizen, and he told me that his uncle had once hidden a ring inside a fairy cake, and the woman had nearly swallowed it and then said maybe that was a sign. I said that putting jewellery in food was a gamble and his eyes lit with the knowledge that he had discovered a new way to annoy an adult. As they left Rani whispered, \u201cYou\u2019re doing a workshop on Thursday,\u201d and by the time I had said \u201cam I\u201d she was texting someone a confirmation and adding, Teacher discount if we bring our own flour.\n\nI took the long way home, past the theatre where Claire had convinced a city councillor that an open day counted as outreach even if there was a bar, past the barber with the window plants that looked perpetually surprised to be alive, past the butcher with his new habit of proffering paprika with a seriousness that implied penicillin. When I crossed the footbridge a man was untangling the fairy lights and swearing with the delicacy of a person who had been brought up near clergy. He glanced at me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re the bread,\u201d in a way that made me want to point behind me to a man carrying six baguettes and pretend I had been mistaken for someone else. Instead I said, \u201cI had a bread,\u201d which is not grammar but is accurate enough for a towpath. He asked if my mother was the woman who had cried beautifully, and I said yes, and he said he would be asking her to stand for the council and I said he wouldn\u2019t be disappointed in her principles.\n\nAt home, the flat had done that thing home does when you\u2019ve been seen by other people\u2019s eyes; it had become truer in order to reassure me. Marmalade demanded reparations for my absence and then forgave me in exchange for a spoon rinsed under hot water as if I had invented the concept of rivers. I stood at the sink and typed a polite yes to Shivani, added a line about liking deadlines that assumed the shape of a lie, and asked when she\u2019d need it. She wrote back with the velocity of someone who knew how to make a day move: end of the week, two photographs, keep it under a thousand words because nobody wants to scroll forever while holding a cup of tea.\n\nMo arrived without knocking because I had given her that permission years ago and would not take it back even though she abused it beautifully. She carried a tote bag with a hedgehog printed on it that insisted we were in this together, and in it were three apples, a newspaper folded into a kind of swan, and my old scarf that I hadn\u2019t seen since last winter. She put the apples in the bowl and the scarf around my neck and sat down as if the chair had been expecting a sermon. She had watched the stream twice more and had notes, which is the way her pride makes itself useful. She told me my left hand had done a small wobble after Crispin had said the word heavy, and she had written in the margin of her mind, Do not take it in. She told me that Jas had handled her pastry as if it were a breath and had therefore deserved to win, and she told me that the man in the third row with the velvet collar had sneezed silently and she had admired him for that.\n\n\u201cShivani wants a column,\u201d I said, and Mo smiled in a way that made the kitchen warmer.\n\n\u201cOf course she does,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cDon\u2019t be clever in the first paragraph. Be clean. Put your father in when people are already with you. Make them taste the quince before you tell them why you use it. Don\u2019t talk about roots unless you\u2019re going to talk about boots. People like the sound, but they prefer the heel.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been writing behind my back,\u201d I said, and she shrugged in the direction of the window.\n\n\u201cYou put fancy words in your pocket and forget to check them when you do the washing. I fish them out and make soup.\u201d She pulled a notebook from her bag and I caught a glimpse of a page on which she had written, in her crabby open palm, Marmalade should have a say, and below it, Not cute. Wise. I put my hand over my face and she laughed and tapped my knee twice.\n\nThe workshop on Thursday was in a classroom with walls that had been painted with slogans by people who had never been shouted at by a slogan. Rani introduced me as a writer and then as a baker and then as a person who could make an egg do what it was told and a metaphor behave, and thirty children looked at me in the way children look at adults who claim to be good at anything. We made buns and called them cobs and then had a friendly argument about the correct word. Flour flicked through the air like an argument between angels. A boy with a serious fringe told me that bees die if they sting you and wasps don\u2019t, which is why wasps are confident, and I considered that this explained many human men I had met. A girl drew a diagram of her route to school on the back of the recipe and coloured the paving stones according to whether they were lucky, and when I asked her how she knew a lucky paving stone when she saw one she said it made her shoe nicer. I read them the part of my book where the man thinks he\u2019s made of winter and half of them rolled their eyes and the other half asked if winter had a colour, and I left the room with flour in my hair and the sense that my yes had purchased me something I couldn\u2019t list on a bank statement.\n\nAt the end of the day, washing mixing bowls in the tiny sink of a classroom that had once been a cupboard, I received a message from Alfie with a photograph of his bees looking like small, irritable gods. He had watched the stream again and wanted to give me a jar of the honey he used when he wasn\u2019t performing for men with moustaches. We arranged to meet at the market on Saturday and he added, unbidden, that he had an aunt in Urmston who made parkin that scared him and that he would bring it if I promised to be kind. I told him I would be afraid of it on his behalf and he sent back a row of laughing faces and then a picture of a single bee with the caption, She is a nightmare and I adore her, which made me hope the women in his life were well defended.\n\nOn Friday I went to Bury with Mo because she said she hadn\u2019t walked the market in rain for a while and her body had that itch it gets when it needs to be among stalls. We moved through the hall with our shoulders squared and our hands respectful. The fishmonger flirted with Mo in the way men flirt with women they would like as captains, and the spice merchant nodded at me like a co-conspirator and slipped an extra pinch of saffron into my packet with the gravity of a man who has done something irregular. I bought caraway by the fistful because I had given too much of it away in the last week when people asked me what the flavour was and I wanted them to have it in their hands, and Mo bought a small tin shaped like a bus for a child she did not yet know because she is always preparing for visitors. At a stall selling second-hand books I found a slim volume of Lancashire dialect that had been annotated in pencil by someone both pedantic and tender, and on the train back I made Mo listen to me say, \u201cHappen\u201d and \u201cNowt\u201d as if I had discovered them and she had been using them uncredited for sixty years.\n\nI wrote the column on Saturday morning and sent it on Saturday afternoon because if I had kept it until Sunday it would have become an enemy. I kept it under the word count because I wanted to be the sort of person who could keep their own flour under control. I wrote about the draught and my father\u2019s ladder made of string and the way quince keeps its shape if you coax it, and I did not write about the moment in the room when I had felt my fingers forget themselves because that was for me. Shivani wrote back before tea to say that it had made Elsie put the kettle on and that Mei-Lin had asked if I would please not encourage the entire north of England to pipe quince into bread because she did not have enough counter space for a revolution. The photographer would come on Tuesday and would insist I stand near a window and pretend not to be posed, and could I please iron something even if my mother had ideas about the corruption of irons.\n\nSaturday evening Rani arrived with a rolled-up poster tube and the kind of cake that can only happen when someone has bought more lemons than is reasonable. She unrolled the tube and the sign fell out and made a little thump on my rug, the letters cracking at the edges in a way I found endearing. We ate cake with spoons because we could not find a knife that did not smell faintly of garlic and we talked about the library\u2019s chair situation. There are never enough chairs, she said, and people are always pretending to be okay with three people to a stool. She had been told that the council might fund four more if we could demonstrate usage and she had an idea she wanted me to hate. A bake sale, but not cute. A bake sale in which each item came with three lines from a story and you had to assemble a page by buying three buns. I told her this was a pyramid scheme in sensible shoes and she accused me of being afraid of fun. We scheduled it for the end of the month and she made me promise to invent something for people who didn\u2019t eat butter, which she pronounced with comic sorrow like a priest intoning a necessary sacrifice.\n\nJas came on Sunday afternoon with a box tied with butcher\u2019s string and cheeks that suggested she had been both praised and scolded by the week. We had exchanged numbers in the kind way people exchange numbers when they have stood under the same light and want to keep that permission alive. She carried herself like someone who had spent years in rooms learning how to hold her tools and her face, and in my kitchen she relaxed two degrees as if the particular clutter told her who I was. She gave me a tart like a folded letter and I made coffee so carefully you\u2019d think it had a camera on it and we sat on opposite sides of the table like a pair of detectives comparing notes.\n\n\u201cI liked your seam,\u201d she said, in a tone that might have sounded arch if anyone else had used it. \u201cIt was a risk. You made it behave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did a little pinch,\u201d I said. \u201cWhen the draught got ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have a draught,\u201d she said. \u201cMine is men in hats.\u201d She told me she had gone home after the final and baked biscuits that had ingredients and anger, and then she had taken the anger out and left the ingredients and had sent the biscuits to her neighbour who watered her herbs when she forgot to water her own life. She asked me if I had ever laminated pastry and I told her no because I like my sanity, and she laughed without sound and described the tiny courage it takes to leave butter where it is, and how the layers will teach you if you let them. We traded half-recipes as if we were smugglers and promised to meet again and not talk about moustaches or men with clipboards for a whole hour.\n\nThe week folded itself into a routine that felt almost like a ritual. Morning with tea and Marmalade and a paragraph of my own, then dough, then words that belonged to someone else, then a walk by the water to apologize to my back for the kneading, then returning emails with the briskness of a clerk who likes his stamp. People wrote to tell me their fathers had put mugs out in the morning, and people wrote to argue about desiccated coconut, and people asked me for the quince recipe and then wrote again to tell me they had used apples because quince hadn\u2019t turned up in the shop and could I promise that the result still counted. I said yes because I am not the kind of man who tells a woman from Romiley her cake doesn\u2019t count. The photographer came and made me stand in the doorway and laugh with my mouth closed and then he took fifty pictures of my hands as if they had done the flour all by themselves. He told me his girlfriend had learned to make banana bread during the first lockdown and then unlearned it during the second, and that sometimes her standing at the oven waiting for something to rise had been the only proof he needed that days existed.\n\nMo decided that her contribution to the bake sale would be a tray of something that could stop a door if necessary. She rifled through her copy of Bero with a nostalgia so sharp I could have leaned on it and got a splinter. In the end she chose tiffin because it sits there looking unassuming and then makes you glad in a way you didn\u2019t prepare for, and because it allowed her to say the word digestive without blushing. We made it late at night in our socks, crushing biscuits with the ends of rolling pins and feeling like vandals, and when the chocolate set we cut neat squares and tried not to eat more than three in the name of quality control.\n\nOn Thursday the town discovered a hole in its pavement near the co-op and this gave everyone something to talk about that was not hard news. Men gathered around it with the solemnity of midwives, hands on hips, heads tipped to consider the hole\u2019s personality. A woman in a high-vis vest poked it with a rod as if she were interrogating it kindly. The hole had the arrogance of a young starlet. I watched for ten minutes and then tore myself away and went to the canal where the man with the fairy lights had tamed them and was sitting on the railing like a boy. He told me his mother used to work in the offices at the Glassworks when it was a place for making things that sang and that he had a photograph somewhere of her in a dress that believed in itself. I told him my mother had received a whisk from herself and he said that was exactly the sort of woman he\u2019d be willing to follow into a bureaucracy.\n\nThe evening before the bake sale the group met at the caf\u00e9 in the library with a purposeful abundance of Tupperware. Benji had made something vegan that smelled like a new kind of science and tasted like a triumph, and Claire had produced small pies that might have been illegal in more than one country for being both generous and unobvious. Richard had created a tray bake cut into pieces named for lines that only trains and hymn writers remember, and each had a little label written in a script so careful it made me feel like I hadn\u2019t loved my own writing enough. Rani moved among us with a clipboard and a borrowed authority and told us that if we made the schoolchildren pay more than a pound for a bun she would put us in her notebook under My Little Tyrants.\n\nAt the sale itself the room filled with the hum of people behaving better than they needed to. Children stuck three strips of story to a page and then traded them like football cards and shouted when they found a sentence that matched their friend\u2019s. An old man asked me for a piece of parkin and then told me, as if I had been planning to disagree, that parkin is not for the day, it is for the week, and I agreed and wrapped it and told him to put it in a tin under his stairs. A woman bought two buns and then asked me to sign the paper they were on as if my name would improve the crumb, and when I looked up she was already crying, which is a hazard in a town where emotion is often stored up accidentally and then spilled in front of a man selling his wares. We made enough money for six chairs because Claire had made eyes at a councillor and Richard had sold his railway squares as history and Rani had put out a jar that said NO PRESSURE and the jar had worked like a spell.\n\nAround nine, home with only the corners of the day left, I took out the bowl with the predictable weight and sifted flour into it with the satisfaction that comes from knowing what happens next. Through the wall Mr. Halley sang a full song without stopping and I leaned my head against the cabinet and smiled because the rhythm was the one he used when he sanded a bannister or told a story about the nineteen eighty-six winter. My phone buzzed and I dried my hands, leaving a print like a fossil on the towel. Shivani had sent the proof of the column with a note that said the copy editor had put a comma in a place that did not deserve it, and did I mind if they kept my uncapitalised north because it felt like a choice. I said yes because I liked the way she had asked, and then she sent me the photograph that would go with the piece and I said, unexpectedly and out loud, \u201cAll right,\u201d because the man in the doorway did not look apologetic; he looked like someone who would put flour in his hair on purpose.\n\nIn bed, the cat finding the hollow at the back of my knees with a precision that would have impressed a cartographer, I took up my notebook and wrote a page that belonged to a man by a lemon tree and a tram line at once. He took the lemon and put it in his pocket for later and walked to the water and watched a boy on a scooter and a woman carry a whisk like a baton and an old man claim a hole in the ground as if it were a story. He kept moving because movement had become the magic, and over him, I let the sentence I do not yet know how to make elegant stand in its ordinary clothes. Yes, I wrote, and yes again, and yes in the small letters that mean I am not being grand, I am only agreeing to be here with my hands.\n\nI woke at four to the sound of rain being rude and lay there with the catalogue of the week on a little carousel, and then I got up and padded to the kitchen because sometimes lying still feels like a kind of piracy. The dough had done its slow thing and when I pressed my finger into it the dent filled in like forgiveness. I knocked it back and it sighed and I thought, briefly and without embarrassment, of my father\u2019s hands. I braided for nobody, and the cat watched me with the sort of disdain that is a compliment if you squint, and the flat filled with the smell of staying. When I cut into the loaf it clicked in that way that tells you the air did not have its way with you, and I ate a slice standing up and thought that some mornings you don\u2019t need rhetoric, you need butter. Outside, the fairy lights on the bridge shone the way they always meant to, not as an announcement but as a proof, and I stood at the window, and I let the day arrive without telling it what it owed me.",

Shivani sent the link at eight with the brisk little bracket of an emoji that suggested she had already put out two small editorial blazes before breakfast and was ready to put out mine if I panicked. I read it once and then again and then did the ridiculous thing of pretending I was a stranger who had stumbled upon it and needed persuading that quince belonged in bread. It looked like me without the jitters, the photograph catching a moment in which I appeared to know what to do with my hands, a trick of light and posture that any mother would claim as genetic. People found it. They sent messages that were stories disguised as congratulations, paragraphs about the way their grandad crushed cardamom with a hammer and how their aunt smuggled saffron home in a Bible because she trusted God and border guards equally. Someone sent a picture of a loaf with a seam so generous it might have been a motorway, and I wrote back suggesting the B-road approach, which felt like the sort of sentence you only get to write after you have said a large yes in public. Mo read it on her phone with her glasses low and then on her laptop with her glasses high and then printed it and put it under a magnet on the fridge that has been shaped like a tomato for as long as I\u2019ve known what a fridge is, as if paper required the comfort of fruit.\n\nShe rang after nine as if she had waited five honourable minutes to call and could not have waited six without exploding into advice. She said three women in the post office had told her they felt seen by the bit about draughts, and one had admitted to using a hairdryer on her dough when the kitchen lost its nerve, and Mo had updated the woman\u2019s opinion of herself just by saying, \u201cI\u2019d do the same,\u201d in a tone that gave the act a cape. \u201cWe should go and look at some actual citrus,\u201d she said, \u201cif you\u2019re determined to make your poor fictional man stand under a lemon tree for the rest of our days. We could go to that garden, the big new one with pathways sensible enough for me to complain about anyway. We\u2019ll agree with ourselves about the smell and then you\u2019ll stop writing about it like it\u2019s a ghost who borrowed a bar of soap.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you mean the one near Worsley,\u201d I said. \u201cRHS. They have a glasshouse the size of a confidence trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly,\u201d she said. \u201cBring your notebook. Bring me a scarf. I\u2019ll bring the thermos. We can have a sit and pretend the world is Mediterranean until the sky tells us not to be silly.\u201d\n\nWe went in coats that had taken a position on hoods. The bus to the garden moved through Salford with the sort of patience that thinks it might be contagious, and Mo narrated the route with details you don\u2019t get from an app. She pointed at a terrace and said a woman there had once had a canary that sang along to the radio and then refused to sing when the DJ changed jobs; she indicated a corner shop and declared it the best place for funeral lilies because the man had learned gentleness with his hands from a mother who took in sewing. At the entrance she bossed the map as if a path might try to give her the slip, and then, when we found the glasshouse, she let her sensible stride slow as if heat taught behaviour.\n\nInside it was a separate hour. The air held the kind of sweetness that made your shoulders loosen and your past step aside. Leaves had the gloss that suggests money and good habits. The lemon trees, which I had expected to behave like caricatures of themselves, stood with their small green fists unclenching, their fruit the colour of warnings dressed up as favours. A volunteer in a fleece with the garden\u2019s crest explained very gently to a man in a waterproof that this was not the kind of place you took cuttings, and the man in the waterproof looked as if he had been accused of theft and then forgiven for it on the same breath. I stood with my notebook open and did the thing Rani teased me for, which is to look a scent in the face and ask it questions. The lemon wasn\u2019t furniture polish, though that memory elbowed its way into the room with its jaunty deceptive shine; it was pith and oil, bitterness and promise, the sort of sting that tells you a wound is clean.\n\n\u201cYour father would have hated this,\u201d Mo said, not unkindly. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like a plant under glass. He said it made them complacent. But he\u2019d have liked the piping. Look at those hoses, tidy as soldiers. He\u2019d have run his hand along that line and found the place it squeaked.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe always found the bit that squeaked,\u201d I said, and because the ghost of furniture polish had invited the workshop in, I saw him at his bench in the old house, the one before we had central heating and after we had stopped pretending we could fix everything ourselves. He would temper varnish like a man bringing a child round from a tantrum, put a glove on and sand as if smoothing a word. He would stand without putting weight on one hip as if he didn\u2019t trust his own balance, and he would tie a length of cord into a bowline while talking about Mondays as if the knot and the day were the same kind of problem.\n\nWe sat on a bench and watched a child point at oranges with the seriousness of a scholar. Mo poured tea into the thermos lids and passed me a biscuit she had put in for the sake of the ritual even though she refused to admit that tea tastes wrong without something that crunches. \u201cYou could put your man in here,\u201d she said. \u201cHe could stand under the lemon and realise he has been waiting for a different tree all along. Or he could end up working here because you\u2019ve given him too much weather and not enough occupation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make him sound unemployed and easily led,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201che lives in your head. I\u2019m only reporting conditions.\u201d\n\nOn the way out my phone did its small tap. There was an email from a person called Caro whose surname had an abundance of consonants that made me think of law firms and expensive moisturiser. She had read the column \u201cwith enormous pleasure\u201d and had then \u201cpopped over\u201d to my website, which was generous given that my website was essentially a friendly apology with some pictures of bread. She loved the \u201cintersection of narrative and kitchen,\u201d a phrase that made me see a zebra crossing over a chopping board, and wondered whether I had ever considered \u201ca book that explores routes in this way, a memoir with recipes, a map of the north through bakes and the stories that carried them.\u201d There was a calendly link, a word I mistrusted, and three suggested times to chat that week, one of which did not require me to either get up at five or pretend to be a man who used the word brunch like a verb.\n\nI showed Mo the email and she took my phone with the sort of reverence she reserves for photographs of babies and new buildings. \u201cOh,\u201d she said, and then \u201coh,\u201d again, and then, quietly, as if the lemon trees might be listening for gossip, \u201cDon\u2019t let them make you into something you can never stop being without disappointing them. But also, don\u2019t be daft. Say yes and see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be a person who writes only about bread,\u201d I said, aware I was speaking about both pride and fear.\n\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t a person who writes only about anything,\u201d she said. \u201cYou write about hands. You write about waiting. You write about the way people look at one another when they\u2019re not sure what to say. If she wants to let you do that and buy you some flour along the way, then we will call that a win. And I will order five copies and make Auntie Kath rearrange her mantel.\u201d\n\nWe booked a conversation for Friday at eleven, which felt like a time that would allow me to be both articulate and suitably northern. On Thursday Jas messaged to ask if I wanted to come by the patisserie at dawn and see lamination performed by someone whose pastry did not sulk. Dawn and I are not, as a rule, intimate, but I said yes because sometimes your hands need to be humbled and sometimes you need to admire competence up close. I set the alarm for a time that felt like an insult and woke half an hour earlier with the knowledge that Marmalade would take my wakefulness as a personal triumph. She supervised my dressing from the bed, ears pricked, tail scrolling as if she were writing an email of complaint in cursive.\n\nJas\u2019s place at six in the morning was a chapel that had cracked its knuckles. The steel surfaces had the gleam of a surgery and the bins were lined like a row of school children with their shirts tucked in. She placed a slab of butter on the dough with the generosity of a host and then pressed the whole thing with a rolling pin the length of an oar. \u201cThe trick,\u201d she said, \u201cis to accept that most of the action is waiting. You need to tell the butter where it\u2019s going to school and then let it have holidays. Fold, chill, fold, chill. The mistake is thinking you can persuade it with force. The second mistake is pretending the room is not part of the recipe.\u201d\n\nShe pushed and turned and breathed through her nose with the steadiness of a swimmer who trusts her tide. I tried, and my butter told me I was an amateur using my kindness like a blunt instrument. I rolled too hard, then too soft, then apologised to the bench out loud and Jas laughed and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of swearing you can do without swearing,\u201d and I took that as permission to mutter into the dough as if it had personally betrayed me. She made a thousand layers look like something a patient would request for convalescence. We talked in the in-betweens with the shorthand of people who don\u2019t need to set the scene. She told me about her grandmother\u2019s kitchen and the way the men were expected to leave the room after they had eaten because women required space to speak and knead both, and I told her about a boys\u2019 school cookery class in which the teacher had confiscated three wooden spoons for pretending to be drumsticks.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hate it if you get put in a box,\u201d she said, folding neatly. \u201cPeople like putting us in boxes because it makes them feel like they\u2019ve tidied. They think lamination is women\u2019s work until it gets a television slot. They think your flavours are domestic until someone with a moustache tells them they\u2019re history. Do the thing you can stand behind if the camera goes away. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nWhen I left she pressed a paper bag into my hand that turned out to contain two croissants that had survived being alive by learning to bear their own weight. I carried them home like a courier and Mo appeared at my door the way people appear when scent calls them down a corridor. We ate in silence for the first five bites because there are rules and then because Jas had achieved the kind of balance that made speech feel like a left turn with no indicator. \u201cHers,\u201d Mo said, with an authority that would have allowed her to sit on a jury for pastry. \u201cYou can tell. She\u2019s got that thin thing going on that isn\u2019t insubstantial, it\u2019s intent. She\u2019ll do fine.\u201d\n\nFriday arrived in stepped shoes. I sat at the table with my laptop open and my mug at the correct distance and the whisk watching from Mo\u2019s new place for it on the dresser as if prepared to step in. Caro came onto the screen in a rectangle that suggested daylight and money. Her bookshelf was colour-coded in a way that would have given my father thoughts and me a rash, but her face was frank and her smile lacked the sharpness that can make compliments feel like purchases. She asked after the weather in a way that wasn\u2019t filler because she\u2019d eaten rain and she knew it was a meal.\n\nWe talked. She didn\u2019t try to sell me myself, which I appreciated. She had read the piece and some of my zines I\u2019d pretended were private, and she had a softness around the eyes when she said the sentence that made my back straighten. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make you choose a lane,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to see if we can draw two parallel lines that don\u2019t collide and tell a story worth walking along. The essays would be essays. They would not be instructions dressed up in anecdote. The recipes would be recipes, not metaphors that burned. You\u2019d be allowed to be funny. You\u2019d be allowed to be sad. We could call it Northern Routes and then refuse to be lazy about what that means.\u201d\n\nI said the things I\u2019d told Mo about not wanting to be trapped in a flour sack. I said the things I had said to myself about not being ready and then had the good sense to hear them back and dislike them. Caro nodded the way you nod at a child who deserves to keep their reasons and also deserves to have someone hold the door open. \u201cWrite me a page,\u201d she said. \u201cWrite me a letter from the book to itself. Three ideas for chapters. Tell me what you don\u2019t want it to sound like. Tell me where you want it to be on a shelf. Don\u2019t send me a recipe yet. Send me a mood-board in sentences. If we hate it, we\u2019ll say so and spare ourselves a year of pretending. If we like it, we\u2019ll agree to be brave and to have proper lunches when travelling is a thing again.\u201d\n\nAfter the call I did the washing up as if I were punishing a spoon for existing and then went for a walk down to the canal to let my posture uncurl. The man with the fairy lights sat on the railing peeling an orange with the concentration of a botanist. He had a plastic tub of bulbs at his feet and the resigned joy of someone who has more projects than days. He nodded at me and said, \u201cShe\u2019ll have you writing a book with your name on the front and then you\u2019ll have to buy two of those pens that leak ambition,\u201d and I asked him, mildly, whether all towpaths came with clairvoyance. He held up the orange like a lamp and said, \u201cYour mother works fast and so does my cousin,\u201d and I said, \u201cI know,\u201d and we agreed that if you\u2019re going to be discussable you might as well provide snacks.\n\nAt the library that evening, the group held an event that had started as a reading and become a small party because Rani had discovered how to put fairy lights round a lectern without tripping the fire alarm. She had called it Flour and Thunder as if daring weather to take offence, and we had a sign-in sheet that asked for names and whether you\u2019d brought a Tupperware for the leftover buns as though there would ever be leftovers. Claire had organised the chairs so they looked like democracy and Benji had made a zine for the night with a cover that showed a bun in a toga. I read the column and three people made the noise people make when they recognise themselves, the cough-laugh that admits to sentiment without surrendering to it. Then I read a page from the novel in which the man with the lemon tree finally looked up and put his hand on the rough bark, and I dared to leave in the sentence that had felt too much when I wrote it\u2014\u201cHe forgave the tree for surviving,\u201d\u2014and Rani rolled her eyes in a way that conceded the point and claimed it for the South Asian auntie\u2019s collective archive.\n\nAfter, a woman with hair like good grammar approached with the posture of someone who has decided not to make a fuss and is about to do exactly that. She had brought a photograph of her father standing by the Ship Canal in a coat that would have deflected bullets, and she wanted me to have the picture in a way that was not transactional. \u201cHe taught me that you shouldn\u2019t be afraid of salt,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. He taught me that you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to be savoury.\u201d I took the photograph and promised to think about words, and later that night I propped it beside the whisk and the painting because my mantel had trouble saying no to other people\u2019s lives.\n\nWhen I got home there was a shoebox on the mat with my name written by a hand that had learned early to make itself obvious. Inside were three notebooks with covers so battered they had developed personality. I knew before I opened them that they were his, and I knew which his without being told. Mo had written a note that said finally, as if the notebooks had been playing an elaborate game of cache-cache in her house for a decade and she had grown bored. The first page contained an inventory of rope knots and a drawing of a boy\u2019s hand that was not mine and that was mine, and a list in pencil that had been pressed so hard I could read the word indent through the page. Lark\u2019s head, bowline, clove hitch, sheet bend. Under the list he had written, \u201cPractise with a purpose,\u201d and then below that, in a different pen, the words, \u201cDon\u2019t let him learn bad habits.\u201d I sat at the table and copied the names into my own notebook and felt something twist and untwist in my chest with a logic my head had no jurisdiction over.\n\nOn Saturday Alfie met me at the market with a jar of honey that was the colour of a lie told by an affectionate child. He wore a jumper that had been knitted by someone who loved him enough to count rows, and he waved the jar like a trophy in a competition where the prize was winter. He had brought his aunt\u2019s parkin wrapped in greaseproof with a label that read, \u201cDo not perform on the day,\u201d and he made me promise to leave it alone until at least Tuesday, which I converted to Monday with a small internal footnote I hoped his bee ancestors would forgive. We walked past stalls that seemed to be selling the same five sorts of hope, and he told me how being stung had stopped hurting when he learned to expect the sting, and then he corrected himself and said it never stops hurting, you only stop performing surprise for other people. He had watched the stream twice and liked the way my face had decided not to be witty when the judges spoke. He had decided to paint his hives ridiculous colours in spring and had stuck the paint charts under his magnets in a way that made choice an argument worth having with the kettle.\n\nOn Sunday, between the second sleep that counts and the responsibility that puts socks on, I wrote the one-page letter Caro had asked for. I did not proofread it to within an inch of its life because I suspected she could smell fear at that distance. I wrote about how you can tell when a town has learned to carry water and not spill it; about public benches; about ways people talk to one another at the counter when a scone is the excuse; about the old woman who sat with a drizzle cake and read the death notices with curiosity rather than panic; about pepper in gingerbread as a sign of both restraint and revolt. I wrote the three chapters as notes to myself: The Seam, The Draft, The Hands. I wrote the line I did not want it to sound like: I don't want a book that confuses sugar with kindness. I wrote where I wanted it to sit: next to the books people kept by the back door because those were the ones that told them how to get home.\n\nThe reply came at the sort of speed that made me feel seen without being hunted. Caro had a note on everything and the sort of enthusiasm that distinguished itself from flattery by bothering with a comma. She thought The Draft could be both literal and not, and that The Seam might be the place to put a father on purpose and not as an accident of weather. She told me to keep writing, to not try to be delightful on every page because delight is better as a surprise than a house style, and I sat at the table and allowed myself the small, private phrase, \u201cWe are doing this,\u201d which, when said in an empty room, sounds like prayer.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, the town did that thing towns do when you\u2019ve announced something without intending to announce it\u2014it made space and then filled it with opinion. The barber asked if I would include a recipe for the biscuits he pretended not to like and then confessed he liked them a lot when feeling fragile. The woman at the baker\u2019s four doors down told me that if I thought I could write about Eccles cake without being shouted at I should remember I had legs and the ability to run. Mr. Halley held his hat in his hand on a day without sun and asked me if I intended to put anything in about how men forget to eat unless reminded, and I told him the first chapter of any sensible book is called Feed the Men and Nobody Dies, and he laughed and told me I would make enemies in the right places.\n\nOne afternoon I went with the fairy lights man to hang a new string under a bridge that was tired of being a passage and wanted to be an occasion. We climb awkwardly, those of us in our thirties who learned to be careful by falling once in front of a woman we liked. He tied knots that were more confident than mine and I felt my father lean over my shoulder and tell me, kindly, to stop second-guessing. On the underside of the bridge, teenagers had written their names with thick pen in a script that managed to be both defiant and correct, and one of them had drawn a heart in which two initials had been crossed out and replaced, and I wanted to stand there and applaud an honest edit. We finished with hands that smelled like electricity and plastic and sat on the edge with our boots over the water and watched a moorhen behave courageously. \u201cLegacy is daft,\u201d he said. \u201cReputation\u2019s the thing. That\u2019s just how your neighbours talk about you when you\u2019re not there. That you were helpful is enough.\u201d I put that sentence in the book without changing a word and felt, afterwards, that I had not stolen but been lent.\n\nRani, who refused to let any of us develop delusions of grandeur without paperwork, set us a test in the group. She brought in a bag of objects\u2014an onion, a bolt, a child\u2019s mitten, a playing card bent at the corner\u2014and told us to write the first paragraph of a chapter about each without using its name. We groaned and did it and then found, of course, that the bolt had a story about who it had held together, and the mitten belonged to a child who taught his father to invent warmth, and the card had never won a hand because it had never tried to be anything but itself. She put her feet up on a chair and declared us useful citizens, and then she produced a diary and bullied us gently into writing down dates for readings in towns with names that sounded like places a person would go on purpose and not by accident: Todmorden, Hebden Bridge, Glossop. We all protested travel with comic melodrama and then admitted we would share petrol and return with stories about men in pubs who argued about jam.\n\nOn a Tuesday that had no business being as blue as it was, I went to see my mother without warning and found her at the table with three envelopes open and a fourth held gingerly as if it were powdered and might go up in a puff. She had been adding up her bills, which is a phrase that does not sound like the task it is. She looked up and composed her face into the expression she uses when I tell her I\u2019m fine and she decides to pretend I am. I made tea because love is a hot liquid in this house. We talked about rigs in the Ship Canal that my father had admired and the way the council had finally decided to fix the pavement hole with a seriousness that translated into three cones and a sign. She told me she had received a letter from the GP surgery reminding her she was due a something with numbers and she would go because she believes in both medicine and the power of a nurse who remembers your name. I pretended not to clock the slight stiffness in her left shoulder when she took the mug because watching your parent age is like watching weather set in over a landscape you have walked since you were a child\u2014you notice the dips, you tell yourself the water always pooled there, you inventory umbrellas. She caught me looking and said, \u201cI am sturdy enough to complain,\u201d which in her lexicon is a certificate of fitness.\n\nThat night, back at the table, my hands did their now-habitual choreography\u2014measure, mix, wait\u2014and I opened the Father Notebooks again as if they would cease to be legible if I ignored them. On a page near the end, between a list of sandpaper grades and a drawing of a bracket he had meant to buy, he had written one sentence that might have been for me or for a version of himself he still believed he could persuade. \u201cRemember to do things you like in front of the boy.\u201d I stared at it until the words stopped being words and turned back into marks made by a hand that could not have imagined me at a table reading, a cat deciding whether to sleep or supervise, a loaf beginning its slow proof like a patient heartbeat. I turned it into a rule I could live with. I wrote it on the first page of the notebook I\u2019d bought in Bury. I told it to Rani, who underlined it twice and declared it the most useful manifesto she had heard from a man all year.\n\nIn the middle of the week, in the hour that often gets away because it doesn\u2019t try hard to belong to anyone, I sat, finally, in a caf\u00e9 that had nothing to do with the library and tried to write the chapter called The Draft. The draught itself obliged by creeping under the door, touching my ankles and reminding me that romance is mostly about practicalities. I wrote about sleeve cuffs and door edges and a baker\u2019s wrist, about the way tempers shift when the air misbehaves. I wrote about the patch of cold in the Glassworks that had threatened to make a fool of me, and about the metal bowl I turned into a small climate and something like an ark. I wrote about Mrs. Boylan from two doors down when I was nine, who kept a towel under the front door and called the wind her lodger, and how she would say, \u201cHe pays in stories,\u201d and then tell you a lie about her first kiss being stolen by a man standing in a draught. The sentences behaved until they didn\u2019t, and then I gave them a biscuit and they behaved again, and every time my hand reached for the honey I made it take the pen instead.\n\nI ended the week with half of something that looked like a book if you squinted and with a sourdough starter that had been neglected in favour of more theatrical yeasted things and had therefore invented its own personality. Marmalade sat beside it on the counter and regarded the bubbles with the suspicion of a bureaucrat inspecting an expense claim. I fed it with a little flourish as if it deserved ceremony for simply being alive. The window threw the cold kind of light across the floor and my boots made the click that tells you a season has changed its shoes. I sent the pages to Caro with a sheepish line about the commas and the impulse to please that needed managing, and she wrote back with a voice note instead of an email, as if to remind me that sometimes a human mouth is a better editor than red ink. She liked it and liked me liking it, which is a separate joy. She said keep going, which is sometimes the only sentence you need.\n\nLate, when the town had gone to bed with its radios on low and its appliances plugged in as a statement of faith, I sat at the desk and wrote the second scene in which my lemon man looks at a canal and decides to it rather than from it. The cat made her doughnut at my feet and the dough in the bowl proved itself capable of patience and the radiator clanked with that endearing something that sounds like someone apologising far away. I ended the paragraph where he puts his hand on the metal rail and says, out loud and undramatically, \u201cAll right,\u201d and I leaned back and let myself grin. On the table the photograph of the man in the bulletproof coat watched, and on the mantel the ribbon failed to pretend it was not pleased with itself, and in the corner the whisk gleamed in a way that made it look like an instrument of state. I sent Rani a message that said simply \u201cpage\u201d and she replied with twelve clapping hands and a picture of a banana with a red cross through it because she knows how to puncture and inflate in the same gesture.\n\nIn bed, the room finally conceding to the dark, I lay and thought about the morning and the next morning and the mornings after that. I thought about all the little yeses the week had required and the big ones I had managed to give with a straight back. I thought about the way the fairy lights had found their discipline under the bridge and about Jas\u2019s patience folding butter that behaved better than most of the men I\u2019d met in publishing. The moon did that indefinite trick with the cloud and the curtain and the cupboard and I felt overly poetic about it for a second and then allowed myself to be. I slept like a man who had found a way to be hungry and content in the same day, and when I woke I had a sentence in my mouth and a kitchen that smelled like a plan.",

The kettle sang without drama, the radio murmured about roadworks as if narrating a long relationship, and Marmalade performed the delicate act of ignoring me while positioning herself exactly where my elbows would want to be. On the screen, Caro\u2019s name appeared above a subject line that made my stomach practice a small somersault and then pretend it had not. The words were careful and generous at once. She\u2019d shared the pages with two editors she trusted and both had written back with sentences that used the word \u201cshape\u201d as if it were both noun and verb; one of them had once said no to a book about a fox that went on to be a phenomenon, so she liked her yeses considered. Would I be able to meet in town on Thursday? She\u2019d be at the hotel near Piccadilly with a lobby that had ideas about itself, and we could talk timelines, sympathy, commas, and money, in that order or the reverse depending on my superstition. I read it twice with my mouth full of toast and then again after I swallowed like a man checking for a bone, and then I rang Mo because the act of good news is not complete in our family until it has been placed like a dish between us.\n\n\u201cThursday,\u201d she said, as if summoning a day by the scruff. \u201cI\u2019ll come to the station. I\u2019ll behave. I\u2019ll sit at a distance and pretend I\u2019m not your mother, and if she passes me at any point I\u2019ll smile like a woman who knows things and is dignified about it. Take a notebook and a pen that doesn\u2019t announce itself. Wear the shirt that makes you look like you iron, because you don\u2019t and mustn\u2019t be caught out. If they ask you to write quickly, tell them you can write steadily. If they ask you to be charming, be honest instead.\u201d\n\nAt the hotel the carpet had the kind of pattern that is both expensive and tired of being trodden on by people who have opinions about service. The lobby\u2019s plants wore their own lighting, and the coffee was priced as if coffee were an event and not a drink. Caro met me with a smile that contained no edges and a coat that had learned to hang off a shoulder without looking like a performance. We took a table near a window that had mistaken rain for art, and she unfolded the afternoon with a competence that made the thought of the book stop pretending it was a ghost. We spoke about chapters as if they were rooms we could furnish and then leave without apologising, about the way the word north sits down differently in different mouths, about recipes that don\u2019t act like bait. She had a notebook full of names that sounded like both cabins and battleships, and when she spoke about copy editors she did so with what could only be called tenderness. Money arrived last, as promised, and she put the numbers down on paper as if making a small altar. It would not make me a baron; it would make rent feel less theatrical. She asked if I needed time to think and I told her I need time by default, but I did not want to spend it all on doubt. She laughed, properly, and said, \u201cGood,\u201d in a tone I trusted.\n\nI had not intended to orchestrate a collision, but Mo believes in fate if fate can be reached by a tram. She arrived with the weather on her coat and a smile at Caro that would have felled a weaker agent. Their handshake contained a negotiation and an agreement to continue to like one another in a crisis. Caro called her Mo within two sentences and got away with it because names behave differently around women who have boiled milk for a living. They discussed lemons with unnecessary seriousness and timelines with the cheer of people who know how to ride a late bus. When Caro asked about titles, Mo said, with the plainness she uses to shut down melodrama, \u201cCall it whatever you want so long as you remember people take books into kitchens, not the other way round.\u201d Caro wrote that down and underlined it and looked at me over the top of her notebook with the expression of someone delighted to be corrected.\n\nOn the way home, carrying a loaf from a bakery that overpriced its crusts and underpromised on its crumbs, Mo caught the toe of her boot on the doormat that insists we wipe our paws and stumbled in that slow-motion way that suits the elderly and the overcautious. I reached without thinking and she steadied without drama, and we both performed the ritual of pretending this was not a preview of later. In the kitchen she rolled her left shoulder in a circle that implied honesty more than pain and said, \u201cIt gets stiff when the weather makes a poem of itself. I\u2019ll mention it when I go in for the numbers thing. Don\u2019t say \u2018frozen shoulder\u2019 or I\u2019ll put you in the bin.\u201d I said nothing about bins or ice or the way her tea mug rattled, and instead sat and let her tell me about a woman she\u2019d met on the bus who had dyed her hair blue in defiance of an invisible council of critics and had been praised by teenagers as if she\u2019d invented the sky.\n\nAt the library the table looked like a cross between a field hospital and a craft fair. Rani had pinned an agenda to the corkboard with dots that demanded attention, and she wore a scarf that she claimed could double as a banner if revolution broke out in the biography section. I read the beginning of The Draft, and midway through the second paragraph a chair scraped and then obediently returned to its station, and I had the small high of speaking sentences that had been difficult to coax. Benji said it made his wrists cold in a satisfying way. Claire said I needed one more woman who didn\u2019t care about my metaphors. Richard, bless him, described the draft in terms of railway cuttings and incline resistance and then, because he is a friend, asked me if I was going to put commas in places where they would not embarrass us. We ate biscuits with the seriousness of surgeons on their break and planned a trip to Hebden Bridge where the bookshop owner had promised to overorder on optimism and chairs.\n\nWhen the world is too noisy, I bake things that can afford to fail. I told myself that using the last of the expensive saffron in a midweek experiment would teach me a lesson about humility. Marmalade heard the jar open and launched herself gracefully into the exact space where gravity would be most persuasive if it wanted to win, and for a second the air was full of red filaments that fell as if someone had insulted them. We picked threads from the floor like thieves and I put the rescued shreds into milk and watched it take the colour the way a person takes a compliment only if they believe it. I made a knot I did not intend to keep and ate it hot with honey because I could not think of a reason not to, and my mood, which had tilted towards the edge, found the middle again because sometimes it is as simple as the smell of something that does not require a verdict.\n\nThe train to Hebden Bridge did its best to prove that steel has a sense of humour. We sat with our scripts and our Tupperware and a conviction that we would triumph by numbers alone. Out the window the hills behaved like they had been waiting to be noticed. In the carriage a woman knitted the sort of cardigan that made you think of solved problems, a man whispered into a phone as if conspiring with his own life, and a girl read a horror novel with an expression that suggested she would not be taken in by cheap jumps. The bookshop had windows that believed in afternoon light and a floor that had decided to slope long ago. We read to a room of expectant coats and faces arranged into interest, and when I did the paragraph about a draft finding your wrists, a man in a cap said, at normal volume, \u201cAye,\u201d and then blushed like a child who has been caught out loving. After, a woman told me her mother used to stand with the oven door open and warm the kitchen as if it were a body, and that in her house the word \u201cproof\u201d had nothing to do with documents. I signed three copies of a book I had not yet written as if I were witnessing a marriage that would not take place for years and bought a second-hand paperback with a flyleaf that had loved someone else more than it loved me.\n\nWhen we were packing the banner back into its indignity, my phone buzzed with the plain text of fear. Mo had rung the surgery because the stiffness had become honest and the nurse had made the sort of face over the line you can hear. It wasn\u2019t urgent, which is a word that can be both cloak and knife; it was a come-in for tests and don\u2019t panic in extremely large letters. I told Rani in three sentences and she became a shape we all rely on, folded the chairs with vengeance, corralled our troupe, pressed money into my hand as if I had forgotten I possessed any, and ordered me to send her a text the second I knew anything even if the result was banal. On the bus to the clinic the air was the kind that tells you to be grateful for windows. I sat with my head against the cold and watched other people carry their catastrophes in plastic folders. The nurse was brisk and kind in a way that made me miss being looked after. Mo did not apologise to her body for being a body; she surrendered an arm, an elbow, a list of symptoms that were trivia-colored and grievances that were new. The tests would take a week, which in the language of worry is a year. We walked home with her insisting muscles were attention-seekers and me pretending to believe her. We made soup that tasted like refusing to give in, and she told me again to say yes to the book without twitching.\n\nCaro sent a draft contract with notes in the margin that sounded like a human being. There were paragraphs about territories that made me feel like a landowner and then immediately like a thief who had nothing to show for his theft but guilt. The advance looked like a thing that could turn an old oven into one that didn\u2019t sulk on the left. I allowed myself the fantasy of paying my mother rent without theatre, of buying Marmalade the kind of food that implies she is royalty and I am staff, of not counting the days between invoices like beads on a string. I wrote a scene in the novel in which my lemon man took his hand away from the tree and felt, to his own irritation, that his palm had learned something by contact. He walked along a canal that was not ours, watched a swan behave as if it owned the list of names in the Civic Registry, and admitted, out loud in a paragraph, that he had absolutely no idea where he was going but preferred moving to standing still.\n\nJas asked if I wanted to go in on a bulk order of quince because the market stall woman had misjudged the appetite of a town and was now looking at a crate like I look at my novel on the bad days. We met in the market\u2019s late afternoon when everything has become a little too honest. She had a list and a rolled-up tea towel with a stain in the exact shape of an apology. We drank tea that had been brewed in a metal kettle older than Benji\u2019s optimism and watched a man buy a piece of smoked cheese that required its own legend. Jas told me, carefully, about a built life that had not become a marriage and the odd relief of a disaster that is administrative rather than apocalyptic. I told her about the notebooks in my father\u2019s handwriting and her face did the thing it does when someone brings her a pastry she respects. We did not make a promise to talk about any of it again, which felt like a promise worth trusting.\n\nWe decided that saying yes requires a ceremony, however small. Rani arrived with a sign that had been amended so many times it had become postmodern, Alfie came with a jar of honey that had learned to taste of the place it had been made, Claire brought a bottle of something bubbly that had not been grown anywhere near here and refused to feel guilty about it, and Mr. Halley knocked twice and then once and presented a story like a dish\u2014how he had taken a corner too fast and learned the names of his own hands. Jas came late with a tin that did not advertise its contents and the expression of someone who has kept something safe. We set the good plates on the table because if you can\u2019t get the good plates out to celebrate a contract you may as well sell them. I said, into the kitchen air, that I had signed a piece of paper and did not feel like an imposter because everyone was also eating. We raised mugs and glasses and a whisk because Mo insisted the whisk had earned the right to attend any ceremony. I made a toast that included the word \u201cbread\u201d only once and used the word \u201cenough\u201d more than once, because there are times when you must pick a noun you can live inside.\n\nLater, when their coats had gathered themselves and taken their owners home, I stood at the sink and watched the fat from the stew behave like patterns I could not read and put my hands into the hot water as if I could acquire competence by immersion. The flat held the shape of company for a little while, the chairs inclined towards one another as if they had been listening, the air warm with the intelligence of recent laughter. On the mantel the ribbon had rotated in the draught and was showing its less photogenic side, the painting of the aqueduct watched with patience, the whisk gleamed in a way that implied it had ambitions beyond egg whites. I dried my hands and wrote a page before bed, because I have discovered that if I do not feed the book before sleep it comes to the edge of the bed and asks for a glass of water in a child\u2019s voice.\n\nA week has a way of wandering if you don\u2019t pin it, and this one required new pins. The results at the surgery described a problem with words that sounded like a legal document: degeneration, inflammation, an old injury that had taken its time to introduce itself properly. It was not a catastrophe. It was an adjustment. Physiotherapy. Exercises in a corridor that had decided to smell of disinfectant and resilience. A nurse who said, \u201cYou\u2019ll be cross,\u201d as if pronouncing a benediction. Mo consented to being looked after as if she were humouring us, resolved to take rest as if rest were a suspect neighbour, and stared a leaflet into submission. We got home and I moved the heavy pan to a lower cupboard without being told to, and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t start behaving like I\u2019m a legend whose relics must be venerated,\u201d and then smiled because she knows how to leave a gentleness on a phrase that might otherwise cause trouble.\n\nCaro sent back my notes with her notes on my notes and a question about whether I would mind if the cover didn\u2019t show a loaf but a map. I told her I wanted the sort of cover that would look at home on a kitchen table and not embarrassed in a train carriage, and she wrote back a single sentence that made me tear up for no grand reason: \u201cWe will make the kind of book that sits by the back door.\u201d Contracts were printed on paper that made me feel complicit in deforestation and responsibility. I signed without flourishing because my father\u2019s hand had taught me that flourishes hide trouble. We spoke about a launch that would not pretend to be a coronation. Claire offered the theatre on a night when the roof did not leak, Rani promised a lectern that would not tempt me to slam it, Benji proposed zines tucked under chairs like stowaways, and Richard said he would liaise with the man who had opinions about microphones and pronounce him a friend for the evening.\n\nThe lemon man had been sulking in a corner of my head and now he came out and admitted he had stopped being afraid of being too obvious. He stood in a kitchen that was not mine with a kettle that had learned to obey a hand it did not recognise. He sliced a lemon with a knife that was not very sharp and decided he would write a letter to a person he had not forgiven and tell them they had not broken him, they had bent him into a shape that turned out to be useful in a storm. He walked the path by the water and said hello to a moorhen and did not take it personally when the moorhen ignored him. I wrote him into a tram, and for the first time he did not consider jumping off before his stop in the name of drama.\n\nAt six one morning, the hour that belongs to milkmen and women who train for marathons and men who cannot resist the message tone in their pocket, I woke to Marmalade standing on my chest with the unambiguous expression that translates as, If you think about the book before you think about my breakfast I will move out. The scoop made its small moons, the tin surrendered, and the house reclaimed its equilibrium. I opened the laptop and the email was there, tidy as a sandwich. Caro had spoken to production. If we wanted to catch a season that made sense, I would need to deliver the first complete draft in six months. My mother would say that time was elastic and could be taught manners; I thought of the lemon man, of Jas folding butter, of Mr. Halley\u2019s admonition to sit my hands, and I said the sentence out loud that turns air into a contract. I can do that. Then, because words are cheap until you feed them, I wrote four pages before breakfast and did not tell anyone until lunch.\n\nOn Saturday we tried being tourists in our own lives. The markets were full without being crowded, the sky had ventured a pale blue, and a busker with a borrowed voice sang a song that had made a generation slow dance. Alfie presented me with a small jar of pollen as if I were a priest and he had a confession, and I bought it and didn\u2019t understand it and took it home anyway because sometimes the point is not comprehension but participation. Jas had a tray of pastries that did not pretend to be polite, and the woman from the stall with the handsome cheese told me that my column had made her husband argue with a spoon and she had enjoyed watching him lose. Mr. Halley pointed at a poster on the side of the bus shelter advertising a council meeting and suggested, with the gravity of a man who had fought a battle with a pot plant and won, that Mo ought to attend and then accidentally run it.\n\nWe ended the day with onion gravy and chips from a place that had been given more awards than it had wall space. In Mo\u2019s front room the ribbon had been relocated to a spot near the clock where it could observe time without being its servant, the photograph of the man by the canal had acquired company in the form of a snapshot of a baby who had no idea she had been born into a family that would discuss her elbows for a week, and Marmalade had discovered that if she stared at the fish tank in the dentist\u2019s window for long enough she could see herself and make peace with the idea that another cat existed. We ate with our elbows on the table because dignity is for breakfast, and Mo told me about a woman her age who had gone to the physio and come back with an exercise band and a belief in her glutes, and I said the word glutes in a way that made us both laugh because some words are only funny when said in your mother\u2019s kitchen.\n\nThat night, tired in the good way and hollowed out by tasks rather than by fear, I put the bowl on the counter with its dependable weight and fed the starter that had forgiven me for my flirtations with commercial yeast. The radio murmured a match report as if reading a bedtime story to a nation, the upstairs neighbour dropped a shoe like a period at the end of a sentence that had gone on too long, and outside the fairy lights on the bridge came on with the discretion of a curtain opening at the exact moment it remembers it is paid to open. I wrote a paragraph about a girl who chooses her paving stones and a woman who hides saffron in a jar that used to belong to her grandmother\u2019s buttons, and then I turned the laptop off and let the room become simple again. On the table the contract sat under a book to encourage its manners, on the mantel the whisk shone like an instrument of state, on my phone Rani had sent a photograph of a chair with the caption SIX and three exclamation marks, and in my hands, flour did what it has always done for me when the world asks me to stand up straight. I kneaded until the dough stopped keeping score and I could feel my own shape in my palms, and when I finally slept, it was with the knowledge that morning would arrive without needing me to instruct it and that I would be ready, tea in hand, to say yes in the small ways that keep the large ones honest.\n\nThe next week tested my newfound confidence as if it were a pair of shoes. The first event was a small radio spot with a presenter who had the voice of a man who had found his own throat late and was still grateful. The studio smelled of old carpet and fresh coffee, which is to say it smelled like professionalism. He introduced me as if I had already written three books and one of them contained an answer to something important, and I remembered Rani\u2019s advice to decline grandeur politely without throwing it back like a child. We spoke about parkin as if it were a form of voting, about the weather as if it had a grievance, about the act of handing someone a bun and believing it could help. In the middle of a sentence about quince I looked through the glass and saw Mo in the waiting area, knees together in the way she sits when pretending to be demure, and she mouthed the word \u201cbehave\u201d and then immediately laughed at herself. After, the producer handed me a biscuit in the manner of a man who had decided I was likely to forget to eat if unprompted, and the presenter whispered, as if revealing a library secret, that he had cried at the line about the draught and had then thought about his grandfather and checked himself in the toilet mirror until he looked like a man who could go back to his desk and read emails.\n\nSchool visits have a way of turning a person into a collection of useful anecdotes, and I learned how to tell mine like a tale rather than a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. The year tens wanted to know if you could earn good money writing about bread and whether I had ever been on proper telly and if I could put their band in the acknowledgements. In a cooking classroom with knives tethered like nervous pets, we stirred batter and they leaned on the counter and I watched them pretend not to hope that someone would tell them they were good at something. A boy asked if I\u2019d ever been to London without my mother and I said yes and he looked impressed as if I\u2019d just said I\u2019d slept in a tent in the rain. A girl said she liked when I wrote about men being a bit useless and still deserving cake, and I told her that was my favourite subject and she rolled her eyes as if I were obvious and grand and correct.\n\nBetween days that belonged to other people I made the private, ordinary ones work. I went early to the physio with Mo and took notes as if muscles had a curriculum. The physio had forearms that could persuade a brick to behave and a kindness that arrived like a cushion. \u201cIt will be boring,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be glorious in its boring. Do it anyway.\u201d We bought a ridiculous ball to roll against a wall, a band that looked like something a child had made and turned out to be a device for truth, and stickers like we were bribing a six-year-old and decided we were. We came home and did our first set with the solemnity of a launch, and Mo put a sticker on the calendar and said, \u201cThat\u2019s me defying entropy,\u201d and then she ate a biscuit to balance the universe.\n\nThe book\u2019s skeleton began to stand up in my notebook, a wonky figure given life by paragraphs that had been playing dead for months. The Seam took my father and returned him without embalming him, The Draft took my own hands and asked them questions, The Hands took people I have watched measure flour and translated them into a language that let someone in Bolton read about a woman in Bradford and nod at the same moment. Caro sent me emails that acted like lights down a corridor, and when I sent her a page that I knew was half a page she did not scold, she asked me what belonged next, which is why I chose her to stand next to my work with a clip and a pen.\n\nJas came round one afternoon with a bag that clinked because she had bought jars at a charity shop that had previously held optimism and now wanted stewed fruit. We sterilised like champions, the kitchen steamed, Marmalade sulked because no one had consulted her, and the quinces reluctantly gave up their shapes and turned into something a spoon could make sense of. We talked about nothing for a while and then about everything, which is the right order. She stayed for tea and another, and when she left I found a postcard on the table from a patisserie in Vienna, a photograph of a cake that had decided to be a sculpture, and on the back she had written, \u201cButter says yes to heat if you keep your nerve,\u201d which struck me as the sort of sentence you can use for almost any problem if you are brave or foolish.\n\nAt night, when the town performed its quiet and the canal did its black mirror trick and the trams whispered the news of the city, I sat with the page and sometimes produced a neat paragraph and sometimes produced a cross face. On those nights I paced the kitchen and said the sort of myths to myself that suit men alone in rooms\u2014about work, about fathers, about weather\u2014and then I peeled them off like wallpaper and tried again. I learned to end the day with something small done: a paragraph that did not embarrass me, a dough folded for the morning, a biscuit put aside for a friend, a message sent to a person who had given me a story and needed to know it had become something. When sleep came it did not always arrive with its arms open; when it did, I was grateful enough to forgive it for being late.\n\nThe morning Mo rang to say she had found the old recipe for a kind of bread her mother had made and could not name, I left the house with my keys still in my hand as if I were fleeing a crime scene. The paper was soft with being held and the handwriting had been done with a nib that misbehaved. The first line read, \u201cEnough flour for purpose,\u201d the sort of instruction that would give modern bakers an existential crisis. We made it together to see what purpose meant, me reading the ghosts of measurements, her stopping me when my wrist lied, the oven doing its old uneven song. It came out squat and proud and smelling like comfort, and we ate a slice with butter that tried to escape and failed and she said, \u201cThat\u2019s her,\u201d and then, under her breath, \u201cHello,\u201d in a tone that made my eyes behave badly. I put the recipe in a plastic sleeve because I am not above acts of clerical devotion, and I wrote the story down before it started to turn into legend in my hands.\n\nMonths have a way of stepping up behind you and clearing their throat, and this one was no different. The book had become more than a rumour; the novel had stopped sulking at corners and started turning them. Mo\u2019s shoulder, worked into ordinary, had added a repertoire of noises to our living room soundtrack, and we could tell the difference between a good click and a rude one. The fairy lights under the bridge had been replaced twice and re-tied with a competence that suggests love. The man at the butcher had decided paprika was not a human right after all but a kindness he would not be held hostage by. Mr. Halley had a new hat that made him look like a man you ought to take seriously when he said the winter of eighty-six was a proper winter. Marmalade learned to open a cupboard and then, having mastered it, decided she would rather be admired than use her powers.\n\nOne night, at the end of a day that had required me to be seven people\u2014son, writer, neighbour, baker, man in a shop choosing a lemon, man on a bus watching a toddler negotiate stairs, citizen\u2014Rani sent a photograph of the theatre lit up for an event that was not ours. \u201cSoon,\u201d she wrote, which can be a threat or a promise. I held the phone and felt the panic that pretends to be a friend when you have something to lose, and then I took a pan out of the cupboard because sometimes the only thing to do with nerves is to cook them down. I made onion gravy with patience and wine and the sort of attention I reserve for sentences I hate and people I love, and halfway through I remembered I had promised to write five hundred words before bed and I wrote six hundred and stopped before a paragraph ended so I could begin clean the next day. Then I stood at the window, the city stroking its own back with light, the canal holding steady as if to say I\u2019ve got you, and thought how strange and lucky it is to be a person who can turn a day into a line and a line into a loaf and give both away without feeling emptied.\n\nWhen I finally lay down, the cat took her place with the entitlement of the only creature in the house sure of her job. The whisk on the mantel tilted a fraction in the breeze we pretend not to have. Somewhere a tram sighed as if satisfied with a shift completed without incident. My hands, which had learned to recognise the proofing bowl in the dark, rested in the space between. Morning would come and bring with it the list and the kettle and the pages I had not yet offended, and perhaps a man with a moustache, perhaps a child with a question, perhaps a bread that wanted to tell me who I was trying to be. I closed my eyes and told the coming day I would meet it at the door with my shoulders down and my pen ready, and in the last seconds before sleep I thought, without embarrassment, that I might be equal to what I had asked for.",
