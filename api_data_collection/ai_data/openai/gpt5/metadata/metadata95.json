     "novel_text": "The reeds at Woodlake whisper when there is news. They knock their hollow bones against one another and make a music like chilled bells, or like nervous teeth, and the sound carries over water black as a sleeping mirror. Dragonflies rocked on the air, lantern-bright, and the first pale fogs of evening came unshouldered out of the water and the alder trees. Somewhere, deep beneath the surface, something boomed \u2014 not loudly, not at all like thunder; more a steady drumbeat in the bones, a reminder, a hello. It had been happening all week and nobody agreed what it meant. Perhaps the lake settling. Perhaps an old, fat catfish, thumping the silt with its tail. Or perhaps \u2014 the old women said, in the back galleries of the market \u2014 perhaps Woodlake itself had taken up a heartbeat to warn its princess.\n\nLiora liked to walk when it began. Alone was not quite the word, because Bramble would not entertain it. He trotted beside her, ears up, tail feathering brief spells in the air, each step of his small paws loud with importance. He was a mutt who looked like the leftover dream after a braid had been unplaited \u2014 half grey like morning ash, half brown, with a nose that was always damp and always looking for secrets. His eyes were ridiculous. Not because they were large, though they were, but because they wore all their feeling on their glossy sleeves. It\u2019s uncommon for princes to allow such honesty, and princesses risk it only if they are very brave or very foolish; Liora was sometimes both.\n\nWhen the boom came tonight, Bramble stopped so suddenly he slid among oak leaves and flailed, and then he lifted one paw and pressed it against her boot as if to say, Could we maybe not. She bent and pressed her forehead to his, and he sneezed and looked aggrieved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a drum far away,\u201d Liora said to him. \u201cOr else it\u2019s like when you lie with your ear against the earth, and you\u2019re trying to hear someone crossing the heather. It\u2019s something under all this.\u201d\n\nBramble made a sound. The sound said this: I am a good dog. I am your dog. I will follow you under lakes and into fires. But perhaps first supper.\n\n\u201cYou eat like a raven,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had three suppers.\u201d\n\nShe wore no circlet tonight, no gem-knotted cloak. If anyone had seen her in the wilder reeds and asked they would have thought her a woodcutter\u2019s daughter with wandering thoughts and mud on her hem. She had the look of her mother in the eyes \u2014 green as green can be without looking witch-lit \u2014 and her father\u2019s mouth, a little severe when she was thinking hard. She carried a willow-twist staff because the kings and queens of Woodlake had always carried such, partly for ceremony and partly because the willow leaned and listened and had opinions about the way magic moved. It swore it could hear the sky sometimes. It hissed when she dipped the end into dark water. Hush, hush, hush.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting louder,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother boom, a slow pulse. Her heart tried to match it; it made her chest feel asymmetrical. She touched the staff to the surface and for an instant it wasn\u2019t a mirror anymore. She saw blue stone and two figures in a long room with a ceiling of glass \u2014 or not glass, a substance so polished it had forgotten how to be touched \u2014 and behind those figures a column of light that wasn\u2019t light, and the feeling of falling and falling. She gasped and drew back. The water returned to the lake\u2019s ordinary interiors: weed, silt, those tiny curling creatures that looked like punctuation marks.\n\nBramble sneezed again, harder, and then he trotted forward and pressed his paws onto the wet wooden deck and peered into the lake as if he might find the very thing, and if he could catch it maybe he would shake it until it let go of their world. His reflection distorted. He growled at himself, then pranced and forgot why.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Liora said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost bell-five. If I don\u2019t sit to supper and smile and tell three stories to the minor houses, I will hear about it from now until the thaw.\u201d\n\nShe went up the path without watching for where she placed her feet, trusting the path to be where it always was. And it was. The castle of Woodlake lifted in gentle habits above her, not a beast of stone so much as one that had grown. It was built of pale marble and dark timbers, and there were gardens that went in and out of its bones. The windows were tall and full of light until the day failed, and then they held on to the light and made it seem like their own. The walls had feathers of moss and the roofs drank the first snow. It was a place that had never been at war, not that anyone living could recall; Woodlake had sent boats loaded with grain, had sent woodworkers to shore up cities after quakes, had sent a princess with white flowers in her hair to marry a prince and stitch one wound shut. They had never kept an army ready. Perhaps that was an old omission at last ready to be corrected. Liora did not think of that as she climbed. She thought of the reverberating beat beneath the dock, and of how far off the warm smell of spiced lamb was.\n\nThree boys were racing at the gate. They stopped when the guards nodded and Liora lifted a hand and said, \u201cWho\u2019s winning?\u201d One boy with a tear on his cheek. One with a scab on his forehead. One with a piece of twine around his wrist, as if a string could keep him from falling away.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d the three said together.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to race again,\u201d Liora said gravely. \u201cWe can\u2019t have three winners. What would the drummer say? He\u2019d have to beat a very odd rhythm to march you home.\u201d\n\nThey blinked at her. The smallest said, \u201cPrincess, is the drum in the lake bad?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re a fish who loves silence.\u201d She pushed at the smallest boy\u2019s shoulder, hardly at all, and he laughed, relieved, and then they were off, feet slapping.\n\nIn the entry hall the new banners hung with the old. The new ones smelled faintly of dye and river-wet linen. The old ones smelled of dust and thyme and grandmothers. Liora touched one as she passed. The woodcutters\u2019 guild had adopted a stag rampant this year. Last year they\u2019d made-do with crossed saws. \u201cA promotion,\u201d she murmured.\n\n\u201cWho, my dear?\u201d Queen Tamsin looked up from where she sat on the bottom step of the stairs correcting a ledger even though she had a perfectly good steward to do it. Other queens use their hands to wave or to hold hands out for kissing. Tamsin used hers to count. Liora loved her more than she knew how to say and also found her sometimes like an irritating splinter she couldn\u2019t quite pull free.\n\n\u201cThe stag,\u201d Liora said. \u201cIt used to be saws. Now I suppose it\u2019s a more rugged identity. The lake is booming again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat it is,\u201d Tamsin said, pursing her mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ve sent three boats out. Corin says there\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary going on under the teasel islands.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell Corin to bring the boats back before full dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think there\u2019s danger?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there are secrets. You know how Bramble gets when there are secrets.\u201d\n\nThey both looked down. Bramble had found the steward and was making a complex attempt to steal the man\u2019s pencil by appearing to be concerned about the state of his boots. The steward laughed significantly, and then he gave in and tickled Bramble behind one ear. Bramble\u2019s eyes rolled back. He made an incoherent sound, the sound of absolute surrender to the idea of being a dog.\n\nWhen supper began, the hall expanded to accommodate it. It always did. The rafters seemed taller. The air grew rich with steam and spice and the holler of everyone trying to talk low. Liora took her place and answered every question with patience and a soft voice. She asked more in return. This was something Tamsin had impressed upon her early: if you want people to trust you, you must be curious about them. It is easier to lie to someone who never asks, or to someone who hides inside their own head with a nice book and a dog. Much easier.\n\n\u201c\u2026and the early apples will be thin,\u201d said the boy with the twine around his wrist, now carefully man-shaped and placed with his father at the low table near the dais, the one for the small houses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send trade to Fairmere,\u201d Liora said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had too much rain and their orchards will bend themselves down with what they can\u2019t press. We can put it into jars: spiced, boiled, dried. You know the ginger recipe? It\u2019ll turn your tongue into a river.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d his father said, bowing slightly, grateful and a bit embarrassed. \u201cThe drumming\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s eyes skimmed the hall. She had the way of knowing when to look where \u2014 her version of magic, Liora sometimes thought, stronger than any spell. Now her gaze paused, and a moment later the door-hall opened of its own accord because a man, a messenger, had made up his mind that it would. He looked as if three roads had each tried to keep him. Dust at the cuffs and the mouth. Rain in his hair like needles. He wore the black coat of the Crown\u2019s roadmen \u2014 those who bore news that had to be heard even when it wished otherwise \u2014 and he was exhausted in the peculiar way of those who don\u2019t stop because stopping would be worse.\n\nHe did not kneel. He blinked when he saw Liora with her willow staff leaning at the table and Bramble under her chair; he blinked when he saw Tamsin on the stair. He took a breath that sounded like it hurt him and said, \u201cI come out of Vale. I came as far as Woodlake in two days. I am sorry for my face. I have a letter. I have something to tell. There is a princess in the North, and she says she is going to end us.\u201d\n\nThe hall steamed and went still. People exchanged glances the way fish exchange flashes of light. A princess, he had said, and not one of the old pricking pranks like put a frog in your boot. End us.\n\n\u201cCome closer,\u201d Tamsin said.\n\nBramble rose, hackles up. He was not often a dog for hackles. Liora put a hand down and felt him vibrate under her fingers and he calmed because he believed in her hand more than he feared whatever this was.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Liora asked as he climbed the dais steps. He kept his eyes off the food and she loved him a little for that.\n\n\u201cSaeth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll sit and eat when you\u2019ve told me.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, once. He put the letter into Tamsin\u2019s hand. It bore in cracked red wax the sunburst of the Upper Crown, but Tamsin didn\u2019t break it. She watched Saeth\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cShe calls herself Vesper,\u201d Saeth said. \u201cPrincess Vesper of the Black Spire, though the Spire belongs to no one. She went up three moons ago. She took two hundred and thirty-seven with her, and half were witchers and half were masons and the rest were\u2026 the rest were the sort of men who build roads through places where roads do not wish to be. And women. She took women too. She said she had a right to the Spire because her grandmother\u2019s grandmother had watched the sky fall open there once. She keeps saying things like that. She says a great many things. At first everyone laughed. It\u2019s not easy to take someone seriously when they bring bees into a meeting hall and light them like candles. But we stopped laughing when the auroras came. We stopped when the rivers ran backwards a while. We stopped when \u2014 forgive me the saying \u2014 when birds fell like apples. Then some came and told the Crown and the Crown told me to run faster.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat she wants,\u201d Tamsin said. She kept the letter whole, as if breaking it might break something else.\n\n\u201cShe says the planet is wrong. That Alderra was bent a little crooked and the crookedness is why the sky sometimes catches and tears, and why the mountains still strap themselves on each other when we sleep. She says to fix it would be to end it. She says to end it would be to begin it right. She says she would lay her head down in the ash along with us and sleep fine.\u201d\n\nLiora felt ill. She sat with her hands open on her knees, the way you would if you were going to stand suddenly and did not wish to knock the table askew. The willow staff, propped behind her, hummed so faintly she could have believed she imagined it. People say mad to mean dangerous. They say dangerous to mean mad. Neither are useful for understanding. She had been taught by a woman who kept bees and who did not light them. She had been taught to look.\n\n\u201cWhat does she have?\u201d Liora said. \u201cWhat does she hold in her hands that makes her able to do more than promise?\u201d\n\nSaeth swallowed. \u201cThey brought machines up. Old ones. Things that had been in the Black Spire since before by-Grandmother time. Ropes that sang when you pulled, and glass that changed when you looked at it, and ladders that turned to light when you stood on them. I did not go inside. I sat on the scree behind a pike of stone and watched. The night was a green shade like bruising. She stands there with her hands up and the stars flicker, and the air goes thin. She\u2026 Princess, forgive me, I know how it sounds, but the ground rose and bit itself. The Black Spire is not so black anymore. It\u2019s shining. And there\u2019s a humming, and the rivers\u2014\u201d He reached for the letter in Tamsin\u2019s hand as if it were a little boat that might steady him. \u201cWhen I came into the new road through the Ash Plain, I had to tie rocks to my boots to keep from taking two strides and then being thrown ten in the air as if by laughter. Everyone is frightened. Some are in love with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is she kin to?\u201d Tamsin said, and broke the seal after all. Her eyes moved. Her mouth made a tight line.\n\n\u201cSome say she\u2019s of the Vale line, but she doesn\u2019t claim them. She claims everything older. She says she is daughter to the first night. She speaks in that way that moves people. I could feel it under my tongue even across the stones. She says we have been sleeping in the wrong bed.\u201d\n\nBramble, who had crept up, put his chin on Liora\u2019s knee and shook once, as if he\u2019d just come out of cold water. She scratched his head and felt him begin to melt again. \u201cI know that way of speaking,\u201d she said. \u201cThey pull you toward an edge and then tell you you\u2019ve always lived there and your bones knew it before you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d Saeth said, startling. \u201cShe asked for you. For you by name. For Liora of Woodlake.\u201d\n\nThe air changed at the table. Not colder. Tighter. Bramble made a low sound, a bottle too much corked.\n\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said: Tell Liora of Woodlake to put her ear to the water, and she will hear what I hear, and she will see that the planet wants an ending.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s hand came down on Liora\u2019s shoulder, warm. She squeezed. \u201cEat,\u201d she told Saeth, brisker than the moment deserved. That was her way of holding things together. \u201cThen sleep in the old winterroom. We\u2019ll decide in the morning what to send back.\u201d\n\nAfter, when everyone else had eaten their sighs and gone to their rooms, Liora stood in the Map Room with the maps in the dark. She did not light a flame. Sometimes you see more in the dark, because the dark is an honesty that doesn\u2019t like to be interrupted. The maps had been drawn over a hundred and thirty-four years by a woman with a particular manner of observation. Every tree that had mattered to that woman was caught in the neat wrist of her ink. Every river that had changed its mind. The Black Spire was there, a small thorn in the north, with a note in tight hand: Do not go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Liora said to no one. To the ink, perhaps.\n\nHer own breath came out and made her a small cloud to stand in. She put her finger to the Spire and imagined it shining. She imagined Vesper with her hands up, calling out the names of the old things \u2014 whether the names were true or were just noise that could be coaxed into shape by the quality of her wanting. Liora did not want to speak with her. She wanted to return the lake to silence and to tell the children at the gate that if they cried for their mothers it would be only because they\u2019d both run too hard and had a stitch.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel that there\u2019s something in your head that is not you?\u201d Liora asked in the dark.\n\nThe room did not answer. The willow leaned against the wall.\n\nBramble exhaled his little snore, and the sound made the lack of answer less bothered. He turned on his back and presented the ceiling with his stomach, with all his vulnerability, because he had decided the ceiling wasn\u2019t interested in doing him harm. Liora knelt and put her hand to that warm small belly. She let herself rest like that until her thoughts had slowed.\n\nShe did not always dream; she was one of those frustrating people who sleep like a healthy river does: with clarity. But she dreamed that night. In the dream she was standing on the dock with the fog coming up in threads, and her staff was gone, and the lake took a breath beneath her feet and said her name. Not in words \u2014 in shape and in pull. She knelt and put her ear to the water and the surface tension held her. It felt like being a cup set out on a table when someone is stomping down the hall. The drumming was louder. It became a steady beat that belonged to a heart that was too slow for any body that size, except there are bodies larger than we are used to saying aloud. It spoke the way hearts speak: not in the language of promises, but in the language of forever. She thought: It wants to be different. She thought: Maybe it wants to hold a different sky.\n\nShe sat up in the dream and there was a woman beside her. The woman\u2019s hair had the color of limestone that has been underwater a thousand years. She was smiling as if she had never learned how not to. She was not beautiful. She was the kind of person you would look at twice because she didn\u2019t look like you expected an ending to look.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been putting your ear to it,\u201d the woman said. Her voice carried the North in it. There is a cadence you get when you speak with the wind rattling at your mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s good. The ears are the last to lie. Sometimes the eyes lie because the eyes are hungry. But the ears are like wheat. They listen and they lean.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Liora said, even though she knew.\n\n\u201cPrincess Vesper,\u201d the woman said, and dipped her head as if to be polite and to mock courtesy in exactly the same gesture. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach you. Sorry to come into your dark like this. It\u2019s too late to be careful. I suppose I could have sent a dove. I don\u2019t like doves.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been calling rivers backwards,\u201d Liora said. That wasn\u2019t what she had meant to say. The dream had made her mouth peculiar. \u201cYou\u2019ve been making birds fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome things fall because they\u2019re tired,\u201d Vesper said. \u201cSome because a different wind owns them. I\u2019m showing the planet its choices. It\u2019s been doing the same thing so long it hasn\u2019t the imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cChoice,\u201d Liora said. \u201cYou mean disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean correction,\u201d Vesper said, gentle as milk. \u201cYou know the stories. How many times the sky has wintered badly. How many times it cracked. How many times the mountains shook hands so hard it broke the houses between. We keep patching Alderra like a kettle. She\u2019s nowhere near the shape she began with. I think we might as well admit it. We could all sit close when it happens. We could hold children tight and not pretend to ourselves. After, perhaps we go somewhere better. Perhaps there is a rightness. Or perhaps there is nothing and we wear that nothing like velvet. It hardly seems worse than this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know despair when I hear it,\u201d Liora said. \u201cI also know a woman who loves a stage. Who loves the breath before the song when everyone is waiting for the next note to fall down their backs.\u201d\n\nVesper\u2019s smile twitched. \u201cYou think I like the theater of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brought bees into a meeting hall,\u201d Liora said. \u201cA little theatrical.\u201d\n\nVesper shrugged. She had the shape of someone who had never been told no enough to dislike it. Liora flinched with an old memory: being a small girl and watching another small girl smash a dragonfly between stones just to see if the light went out of it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight you,\u201d Vesper said. \u201cYou do not strike me as particularly gifted at it, and I hate being bored. Why not lay down your willow and climb the Spire? See what I see. If I am wrong, we will both come down and do what you like. If I am right, I will take your hand and we will pull the planet out of its old bed and lay it in a new one.\u201d\n\nThere were a dozen questions that a careful person would ask then. Liora asked none of them. She stood up in the dream. Her knees were stiff even though dream-knees don\u2019t have to be. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d Vesper said, and her head tilted a little, and for an instant the whole world seemed to sway toward her like trees that have just been rooted up. The power was in her throat and in the cadence, but it was also in her hips and her quiet feet. Everything about her declared a different gravity. \u201cDo not be foolish. You are brave, yes. You are good. Goodness is for farmhouses. We are standing in the place where large choices are made. Sometimes goodness must be set down. The people do not need you to be kind. They need you to be what the air is, and what the old stone is. You must be the hand that does not shake.\u201d\n\nLiora could not breathe for a moment. She knew with a child\u2019s clarity that if she listened to that music too long she would begin to clap along. So she thought of Bramble\u2019s snore, and of the way the steward laughed, and of the taste of the first apple slice of autumn, and of her mother\u2019s ledger written in that narrow unsentimental hand, and of the boys at the gate tying string to their wrists to keep from falling up. It steadied her. \u201cNo,\u201d she said again. \u201cYou are throwing rocks at a beehive because you like the sound, and you do not care if the honey is ruined.\u201d\n\nVesper\u2019s hand moved. The dock under Liora\u2019s feet tilted. The dream was no longer a dream; it became one of the other things. A presentiment or a test. Liora felt water come up and walk into her mouth. It filled her ears. It crowded her eyes. She opened them and Vesper was standing over her with something like tenderness. \u201cYou will come anyhow,\u201d Vesper said. \u201cYou will come and say no, and that will be good too. I prefer to have an opposer. We make meaning when we stand opposite. Without you I am only a girl on a rock pulling at the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not your meaning,\u201d Liora said, but it was full of water, it was an ugly little bubble of remark, and Vesper laughed like someone who had owned laughter since she was born.\n\nLiora woke in the Map Room with her cheek stuck to the cold table. Bramble was standing on her stomach, which is not forgiving if you are a princess. His paws dug into her softest parts and his nose pushed her chin as if to say: up. up. Up now. He smelled worried, which is a little like hot bread and a little like wet. Outside, the lake boomed. Not a dream. She sat and scrubbed her face. The taste of salt and oak smoke sat at the back of her throat.\n\n\u201cI will go,\u201d she told Bramble. The word tasted like iron. \u201cNot to say yes. To say it where she can hear me. Not to let this planet be broken by a woman who enjoys her own voice too much. We\u2019ll leave after the market. Tell no one.\u201d\n\nBramble wagged once and then had to wag again because the first wag had not been enough. He ran in a small circle because his joy was too big to fit inside him. He brought his rope. Then he forgot the rope and barked at his rope as if it had been impudent.\n\nThe morning came up indifferent to their plans, perhaps on purpose. The sky had the color of a metal that has been in many mouths and has come out of all of them disagreeably. People were in the lanes early for Bloomtide \u2014 the year\u2019s first market where the city\u2019s winter-secret crafts come out and the winter-hidden people do too. Liora ate a piece of bread while walking and someone put a smear of honey on it at the last moment and she licked her thumb. The woodsmoke had a hopeful smell. Everything was precious and ordinary.\n\n\u201cPrincess, the herbman says his rosemary died again and he swears it\u2019s not his fault despite the new sign on his window that says BEWARE OWLS.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the owls are his scapegoats,\u201d Liora said. \u201cTell him to grow thyme for a change.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess, the western stair has a crack.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it grow?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs it a crack that has ambition? Or does it look back at you with sleepy eyes and say, enough, I am done.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess, the lake boomed during the candle-blessing. Do you think the candles are now gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the candles will still go out,\u201d she said, and smiled, and did not look aside toward the water because if she did she might not stop.\n\nAt Market, she bought nothing and everything. A boy put a living beetle made of glass into her palm and it ticked and then it slept. A woman pressed a ring on her finger and said for no money at all, take it, I cannot bear to have it in my house. The ring had a small flaw you could love if you looked and looked and looked. And she took a packet of seeds labeled Night-Tears and pretended she had not seen the little sketch in the margin of a plant blooming in the shape of a bell with its mouth shut. She took them because she wrote the names down and the names became her friends. Night-Tears. She wanted to know what they would do if you gave them rain.\n\nWhen the water rose in a shape that was not the shape that water takes, there were four hundred people milling near enough to see it and to remember it badly for the remainder of their lives. It rose not as a wave but as a long low wall that mimicked the shore. It smoothed itself with a gesture that was intimate and lazy. Children screamed because it seemed like fun and then screamed because it was not. The wall moved one half-pace onto the land and then stopped, perfectly matched to the curve of the dock. It held. It was as if a lake had decided it would rather be a different sort of lake for a moment.\n\nLiora dropped the small pack she had packed. She ran. She saw the willow in her hand and did not remember taking it but she must have; it had the familiar weight above her wrist. She raised it because some gestures are older than your reasons for making them.\n\nThe water spoke in the sound of all the water Liora had ever drunk. It said: Do you hear the drum now. It said: Here is your ear, pressed to me. It said: Why would we not try to be new. And then it stopped saying everything and lurched and threw itself back down so suddenly that all the boats, even those tied tight, crashed and banged and the dock\u2019s old ropes snapped and men reached for children and their feet slipped, and for a moment it was chaos, pure and messy.\n\nLiora stood with her staff out, and she did nothing and everything with it. She did not know the name for the gesture she made. It was something like hello and something like sit. The willow sang under her hands. It is possible to remind a thing what it is. Perhaps that is what she did. People stopped shouting. The water drew itself down. There were still splashes where there shouldn\u2019t be, little shining puddles cupped in handprints on the dock. Bramble barked at the puddles and tried to lick them back into the larger water. He sneezed and glared at his nose as if it were to blame.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying,\u201d someone said, breathless, \u201cthey\u2019re saying it\u2019s the Black Spire. They\u2019re saying Vesper.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop saying names and pull the old man up,\u201d Tamsin shouted, voice cutting the market clean. The guard captain hadn\u2019t needed to tell her; she had been moving before the water did. She came up beside Liora and did not ask what Liora had seen because she could read it all in her daughter\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Liora said, very quietly. \u201cMother. I\u2019m going and I want you to pretend you didn\u2019t hear me decide it now, and that I decided it after you told me no, and that I obeyed you all my life and it went fine and that this is not the first time I will disobey.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s mouth did that thing where it held words back by holding very still. She breathed in through her nose and out, and then she reached and pulled a twig out of Liora\u2019s hair because of course there was a twig in Liora\u2019s hair. She held the twig like it meant something. It did.\n\n\u201cYou will not go alone,\u201d Tamsin said. \u201cAnd you will not go today. You will take Corin, and Elyse, and two from the river knights if Shade can spare them. You will take food. You will write me letters even if the letters have to come in on trout. And you will not, not, speak an agreement to anything without letting me say the wrong thing about it first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am leaving now,\u201d Liora said. \u201cIf I leave later there will be a later after later and then someone will be dead whom I love and that will be the thing after which I cannot move. I have to go while I still have motion. I will take Bramble. I will take the willow. Corin will come if he is the sort who comes; I think he is. Elyse will not; she will be insulted you asked her. Shade will let the river knights go if you look at him as you do when you think he is being heroish. That\u2019s a real word. It should be. Look: I will come back in three days if I can\u2019t make a path.\u201d\n\nTamsin laughed because Larry at the fish stall shouted, \u201cHeroish isn\u2019t a word, Princess!\u201d He had good ears, that man. He wrapped a fish in paper and threw it to Bramble who caught it with a dismaying skill for someone who was supposed to be a companion and not a wild animal. Bramble trotted in a circle with the fish and his rope and nearly strangled himself because joy and food and ropes were too much for any one animal.\n\n\u201cThree days,\u201d Tamsin said. \u201cFour and I\u2019ll come after you with reeds in my hair like a madwomen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would know you by your hands anywhere,\u201d Liora said.\n\nTamsin put both those hands on Liora\u2019s cheeks and kissed her forehead and then she stepped back and spoke to the air in a very particular tone that meant she was speaking to the old wood and to the small gods in the mortar as much as to the people. \u201cYou will not fail to return our daughter,\u201d she said, as if the walls were responsible. The walls rustled, embarrassed but consenting.\n\nLiora slung the pack back on her shoulder. It had been packed two hours. Bramble circled once and put his little paws exactly where they had to go for them to be moving together three heartbeats later. They went not to the road that most took to the north \u2014 the road that went along the river and then up into the passes like a thread going through buttons \u2014 but to the older path, the one that went beneath the alder trees in a whispering half-tunnel and then into the old quarry lands where the ground held fossils of fish that had learned to pretend to be leaves. Liora liked that way. She preferred to walk where things had been pretending for a long time. It made you honest. Or maybe it only made you wary, which is another sort of honesty.\n\nThey did not look back at the castle because sometimes it is easier not to. They did not look back at the lake because the lake would be doing that performance where it pretended to be fine. The reeds made their soft teeth-chatter. The willow stick hummed, a thread that grew more taut the further north they went, though there was no reason it should. Bramble loped as if his paws were kissing each new piece of dirt as a personal favor.\n\nShe saw the omen at the edge of the quarry: a hawk sitting on a stone and not minding them at all. Hawks mind you. That is what they are for. This one looked like a thought that had turned to bone and feather because it was tired of being thought. It watched her with all its regard, and that, more than the lake\u2019s new tricks, made her feel hairline cracks in her certainty. She stopped and lifted her hand like she was about to speak to a person. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, stupidly.\n\nThe hawk spoke. It said, in a voice like shale, \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d and then turned into itself and became a puff of dust because sometimes that is what words do to a body. Bramble leapt and sneezed because he had tried to bite the air where a bird had been. Then he looked smug, as if he\u2019d succeeded.\n\n\u201cI will say this,\u201d Liora told the willow. \u201cNot many people have hawks complaining to them about their tardiness. Add that to my list of regrets if I get to have any.\u201d\n\nThe northern path opened exactly as it always had, which felt like love. She felt, as she passed the threshold of alder step to stone step, that she would learn the new way to breathe. She felt Vesper\u2019s voice still in her throat. She knew the other princess had the upper hand because she had just reached into Liora\u2019s dream like a woman reaching into an oven to adjust a loaf. But she also knew what it was to hold a stick of wood that remembers a seed. She knew what it was to have a dog who found his way home by simply deciding that home is exactly wherever you are together.\n\n\u201cBramble,\u201d she said, though he was right there. \u201cWe will stay ourselves. That is all we have to do. We keep being ourselves, and we don\u2019t let her give us other names.\u201d\n\nBramble looked up at her, cross-eyed with happiness, with something like: yes. yes. That I can do.\n\nThe wind in the quarry sang an old song. It was a song without words and without a melody that any man could carry; it moved in and out of the ribs of the mountain and made a sound like a long exhale. It had been there before the first princess was born. It would be there after this had been done or had failed. Liora put her comfort in that, because she was human and she would look for any place to put her comfort where it would remain for a finger-width of time.\n\nShe walked, and the path climbed, and sooner than she wished, the trees thinned to stunted pines, their needles like comb-teeth, old resin tears caught in the bark. Once the wind lifted her hair. Once she felt the ground pulse like it had a desire to be nearer the sky. Once she had to put her hand out and rest it on a boulder with a fossil of a fish leaf locked into it, and the stone was warmer than it had any right to be, as if it had been near a hearth.\n\nAt the place where the quarry steps became the first switchback that no one had ever liked, there was a woman sitting on a pack studded with copper rivets, braids lying like bracelets over her shoulders. Elyse. Of course Elyse had come, just to prove Liora wrong. Her mouth was a decision. She raised one eyebrow, and there was humor in it and warning. Beside Elyse, Corin, who had a brow like a door lintel and a way of looking at the world that made it change its mind. He lifted his hand.\n\n\u201cWe thought you\u2019d try for early,\u201d he said. \u201cShade sends the river knights tomorrow because he likes to make an entrance. We left because we like to be where the story is before it begins to be told wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re both ridiculous and useful,\u201d Liora said. Elyse snorted, but the sound made a smile in her throat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only coming because if you go up there without people you\u2019ll say something like heroish again and I\u2019ll die on the spot,\u201d Elyse said. \u201cI have a weak constitution for poor vocabulary choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeroish,\u201d Corin repeated, and nodded, as if considering the shape of the new word. \u201cIt might be used, if one were careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t encourage her,\u201d Elyse said. Then she stuck out her hand. Liora took it. It felt like a line you throw to someone. It felt like a promise you might return with. It felt like the first chapter pretending to be the second one already, because sometimes you misnumber the ones that matter. The sky hung over them like a lid not yet properly fitted to the pot.\n\nBramble walked under Elyse\u2019s hand and she pretended she did not mean to let it touch him, and then she did, and then she put both hands into Bramble\u2019s fur boldly and made a sound that could only be made when touching a puppy: oh. oh. He looked like he had been touched by the sun.\n\n\u201cWe go then,\u201d Liora said. \u201cBecause if we stand here too long I\u2019ll start to talk. And if I talk too long I\u2019ll start to be afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were afraid when we woke up,\u201d Corin said. \u201cIt makes no difference. We go with it in our pockets, like bread.\u201d\n\nThey went up into the gray with their fear and with their small jokes and with a dog who believed the journey was a long play invented for him alone. Behind them, down in the green-cupped village and in the white-shouldered castle, the lake thumped a patient drumbeat, counting something that nobody had agreed was a number yet. Ahead, northward, there was a bright stain on the sky, green and shaky as certain happinesses, and above it all, the old, old air moved and did not think any of them important. But in the mouths of the new winds the name Vesper curled like a leaf. Liora felt it slide along her neck. She did not quicken or slow her step for it. She held the willow with its hum, and she walked like someone who had not been given the courtesy of postponement. Her hand, when it brushed against Elyse\u2019s, did not shake. It only looked as if it might start to, later, if there were time.They began with the small business of walking, which is the same in any world even when the sky mutters to itself and the bones of the mountain click as if resetting. The path shouldered up and around in a steady patience that would have been dull if not for the smell of iron in the air and the way the light to the north kept shifting like a bruise deciding what color to be. Bramble ran reconnaissance on everything three steps ahead, which meant he discovered every prickly plant by embracing it with the whole of his ridiculous body and then looking at Liora as if she had personally invented burrs. Elyse walked as if the slope had been her idea and now she was irritated by her own cleverness; her braids knocked gently against her cloak like a metronome for the day. Corin liked the land, and the land, obliged to be polite back to a man who was polite to it, offered him a firm purchase, except when it didn\u2019t, and then Corin would simply stand and wait five breaths until the stone remembered itself and stopped sliding around under his boots. Liora felt the hum in the willow adjust by degrees as the hours passed and they climbed, not growing louder, but shifting registers the way a throat clears before saying something important.\n\nAt the bald saddle below the first long ridge, they stopped to drink where a trickle ran out of a seam like a vein that had decided to try being a creek. The water tasted faintly of nails and fern, which is not to be ungrateful; sometimes you want your water to remind you that a mountain is made of something more stubborn than sweet. Liora crouched and cupped her hands and let the cold bite. Then she bent and licked one wrist like a cat because there is no proper way to be sure you\u2019re awake except to let the body say so. When she lifted her head there was a skein of geese low over the pass to the west, and in the middle of their voices she thought she heard a thin chord that didn\u2019t belong to any bird she\u2019d ever known. She looked to Corin and he was already squinting at the sky, as if the light contained a message and he had to find the one place it did not expect him to look.\n\n\u201cIf the Spire had only taken the sky, I\u2019d have been less concerned,\u201d he said, serious as the last knot on a net. \u201cThe hills are changing underfoot. We heard it on the Ash Plain. You take three steps and your fourth is a refusal. Then the ground is embarrassed and tries to make up for it. It throws itself up to you and you stumble forward like a drunk who has been helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019ve never been helped by the earth like that,\u201d Elyse said, smoothing her thumb along the ridges of her palm as if the map of her life were printed there and she was revising it. \u201cI remember a year when we couldn\u2019t get any man to go to harvest without retying all their boots. Everyone was walking like the grass had become a river and we were the stones.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like language,\u201d Liora said, half to herself and half to the willow. \u201cIf you say a word too many times, it stops meaning what it meant. The Spire is saying the word earth so loudly the earth is forgetting what it is, or else it\u2019s remembering some older meaning none of us have learned yet.\u201d\n\nShe pulled her small packet from the top of the pack while they rested, more out of habit than necessity, and touched the folded paper that held the Night-Tears. She did not open it. Beneath the seeds, she had tucked a bit of charcoal and a thin slice of scrap parchment. She wrote in a hand learned under her mother\u2019s strict eyebrows: We are well, for values of well that apply to hills that shrug. The light is a green I do not have a word for. Corin is a piece of good furniture you could stand on to reach a jar on a high shelf. Elyse disapproves of words I invent but only the ones that sound like words I love. Bramble attempted to adopt a hedgehog and failed. If the river knights catch us up, give them my patience and keep yours for yourself. Then she rolled the scrap and slid it into a hollow stem from last summer\u2019s reed she\u2019d brought for exactly that purpose. She made a small hole in the damp earth where the trickle pooled, pressed the reed down, and whispered, \u201cFor the trout, if they\u2019re feeling lettered.\u201d It is not a sure method, but the river has always been nosy.\n\nThe next stretch went under wind that had a logic unlike the usual logic. It did not blow across them; it moved along the ridge like someone sweeping a broom in a long, even stroke. The grasses leaned and then righted themselves, remembering their manners. Liora felt her hair lift once and then settle as if an unseen hand had been checking whether she\u2019d grown. They came up over a lip of stone into a little basin and stopped together because somebody had put a trick into the world there. It was a patch of air with no weather in it, perfectly still, as if the day had a skipped heartbeat. A cloud blew toward it and became a different shape as it crossed, leaner, drawn out, and the shadow it cast on the stones below took on a brighter edge. Corin tossed a pebble and it fell slowly through that patch, changing its mind about speed, as if it had been told a story that made it reconsider its life\u2019s choices. Bramble leapt after the pebble and rose like a bread roll. His paws churned in patient indignation and he looked at Elyse with a betrayed expression that said: You did something to the ground because you love me too much.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t have ideas,\u201d Elyse said, and caught him neatly by the harness at just the spot where dogs forget to be hurt and remember they are loved. \u201cIf you float away I\u2019ll have to go up and get you, and I\u2019ve only brought one pair of good boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be more of this the nearer we get,\u201d Corin said, testing the edges with the tip of his staff, which was not willow and did not hum but knew a thing or two about stubbornness. \u201cSaeth said he tied rocks to his feet. He told no lies.\u201d\n\nLiora put the willow out and the air answered. It hummed the way a bottle hums when you run a finger round its rim, and where she moved it the slow-patch learned her shape. She did not have a theory. She only made the motion she had made at the dock when the lake had thought about being a wall and then changed its mind. The word for it had not been coined; that is not uncommon when you are in the habit of doing the thing you are too young to name. The air adjusted, grew less syrup-thick. The pebble sped up. Bramble put his foot down and found a floor where every floor ought to be. They crossed, not disrespecting the strangeness, but declining to be bullied by it, and when they stepped out on the far side everything snapped back into the proper argument between gravity and defiance.\n\nIt was there, beyond that basin, that they first saw the glow like a bruise become a real thing with edges. The Black Spire\u2014only no one with eyes would have called it black if all they knew of it was what it was now. It had been a pillar once, a tooth of basalt with old nests of wind knotted around it, and the witches and wanderers of the north had made their bargains at its foot, no more and no less. Now there was a latticework clinging to it, a scaffolding of light that looked like the inside of a lantern taken apart and set back up by a careless god. From this distance the structure made the Spire seem not taller but wider, as if it had finally decided to occupy all the space it had been promised. The air around it had the quality of glass that has been blown and is cooling: that slightly shifting certainty, that shimmer like heat over a road even though there was no heat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a temple to a new verb,\u201d Elyse said, low, because sometimes words can wound the throat if you put too much mistrust into them and speak too loudly. \u201cI hate it. I have never liked temples to verbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a work,\u201d Corin said, not admiring, not condemning. He was counting in his head how at that distance the ladders must be arranged, how the blocks of old basalt would have had to be cut away so that nothing fell on the wrong head. He hadn\u2019t been asked to build it and so he made a ritual of not guessing what tools had been used.\n\nA pair of figures came out from behind a rock where they\u2019d been shoveling the wind into sacks so it would not go to waste, which is the kind of thing that passes for ordinary work in the north when strangeness has had time to make itself a nest. They were not witches\u2014no felt hats, no smell of rosemary or horsehair\u2014but they had the restless look of people who sleep badly because their thoughts kick them in the ribs. One wore a sheath for a whisk that hung from her belt as if it were a blade. The other had the shoulders of a mason and the eyes of a puppy who had been told to guard the world and did not understand how large the job was.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re out of Woodlake,\u201d the mason said, as if the air had written on Liora\u2019s forehead in a neat hand. \u201cIf you are selling your steadiness we\u2019ll buy a bottle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteadiness grows wild where we live,\u201d Liora said, because she could not help herself and because the mason\u2019s ears had the exact angle of Saeth\u2019s and she felt like being kind to anyone who might have been his cousin. \u201cWe don\u2019t bottle it. We teach ourselves to drink from the jug.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go that way,\u201d the whisk-woman said, nodding toward the bare slope that led to a pass Liora would have chosen for its honesty. \u201cThe Glean is there, and the Glean has been arguing with itself for days. If you speak where the wind can hear, it takes that word down into the rocks and brings it back up at you with teeth. We lost a boy to an adjective last week. He said forever in the wrong tone. The echoes held him in place until they forgot what they were doing and let him drop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can go along the sheep-path,\u201d Corin said, relief and worry in the same line of his mouth. \u201cIt takes longer. We will not like it because the stones put their knees in our back and demand we tell them stories.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stones here are lonely,\u201d the whisk-woman said, and let the handle of her whisk slide into her palm and out again as if she were calming her hands. \u201cThey like to be told there used to be ice over everything. They enjoy it when you remind them of their greatness. If you are kind about it, they will not be unkind.\u201d\n\nLiora thanked them with more than a word, and the mason ducked his head and the whisk-woman lifted her whisk as if in salute. When they were gone, Elyse said, \u201cWhisks,\u201d in a tone of deep betrayal and then laughed helplessly because she was a person who liked her tools to understand what they were and a whisk ready for battle was a step too far for her tidy soul.\n\nThe sheep-path proved to be exactly what people who are not sheep resent: a sequence of choices that made sense only if your feet were small and your balance had been built by a god who had never seen a plumb line. It ran under a mossed lip and over the mouths of three shallow gullies that had decided to spend this season pretending to be rivers and then skittered along a shelf with a drop on one side that was not death but would have felt like betrayal if you\u2019d gone over it. Bramble managed by making himself not look and by putting his body where Liora\u2019s body had been five heartbeats ago, believing in the magic of repetition. Liora put her palm flat to the rock when they paused somewhere not meant to be stopped on and spoke to the stone without any word at all. It is possible to make the sound you would make if you were a cliff and did not wish to fall to pieces, and she made that sound with her breath, short and soft, and the shelf did not grow wider but it did not narrow.\n\nWhen afternoon leaned toward evening they came into a pocket of old birches that had decided, stubborn as saints, to live there despite the wind\u2019s poor behavior. The white skins made the light kinder, and the ground, out of politeness, grew a little bit of soft grass. They made a meal that would count as supper if one had not been introduced to gravy at some point in one\u2019s life: bread that had been stepped on twice inside the pack and honey with needles in it from the north-man\u2019s stall and a piece of cheese that had chosen to sweat and did not mind that choice. Bramble, who had carried his fish this whole time in his mind, settled for a smear of everything and a stick he pretended was a bone of a god. Liora put her hand on the willow and then on the ground in a line, making her small net of not-spells and not-prayers that she had learned without anyone admitting they had taught her. The birches answered with a shiver that was also a hello.\n\nNight in the mountains is a person who does not care that you are a princess. It climbs into your blankets. It steps on your chest with cold feet and then forgets it meant to say sorry. The Spire\u2019s green pulsed through the trunks as if the corners of their camp were the numbers on a slow watch. Liora lay awake longer than she would have liked, counting through all the tiny noises she had no business counting, until she was so tired her thoughts softened at the edges and her body took her without consulting her mind. The dream came edged in metal, which is how you know someone else is leaning on the doorframe of it. She was back on the dock and Vesper was there again, but this time Vesper had mud on her skirts and her hair had been braided by a practical person. It made her look younger, and that made her look more deliberate, and Liora resented the strategy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no talent for sleeping without a guard at the door,\u201d Vesper said, conversational as if they\u2019d met over tea in a friend\u2019s kitchen. \u201cI like that in a person. You would not do well in a palace where everyone pretends to nap and actually count each other\u2019s spoons.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you visit everyone,\u201d Liora said, \u201cor am I special in the particular way that makes life inconvenient. I am trying to be flattered, but you are turning the rivers back and I have only four hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would have done this anyhow,\u201d Vesper said, as if Liora had offered an apology for something that required none. \u201cYou were always going to walk up after me. It is better to talk now while our feet are not in the same place. When your boots are standing where mine have, your mouth will be a different instrument. I would like to try my song in you before that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not your hollow bone,\u201d Liora said, and she wanted to be angrier at the way Vesper smiled because it was not the smile of a villain who liked to gloat it was the smile of a girl who had chosen a hill and climbed it and now was surprised to find that at the top there was wind and not a crown. Bramble, asleep beside her body, must have heard some of the shape of these not-words because in the dream he came and stood between Liora and Vesper and that was ridiculous because he was small and Vesper was not and yet the air preferred him and put its head on his back like he was a lap.\n\n\u201cYou are very sweet,\u201d Vesper told the dog, and something in her voice softened into something without sharp corners. Then she looked back up and the softness sharpened because that was exactly what it would do. \u201cLiora. I am not trying to put a bridle on you. I am trying to put a bridle on the world. There\u2019s a difference. It will go better if you are not in my way. Come up when you like. Bring your stick. Bring that boy with the door-brow, the one who will be useful when stones take offense. Bring the woman with the braids so she can say no to you when you have wandered too close to admiration. We will make a shape out of our argument and it will keep the planet from breaking like a plate dropped by an anxious hand. If we are lucky, it will break elegantly. I am, at heart, a generous person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you are at heart,\u201d Liora said, and she dragged at her mind to find the right word and did not because the right word was in a language that had not yet found her, and she hated that Vesper made her feel young in the one way that had nothing to do with how many years any person has had. \u201cYou want to remake the floor because you do not like that it is slanted. You have not considered that most of us have learned to walk on it and that we have turned our unsteadiness into a gift, into dancing. You will take away all our awkward grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrace is overpraised,\u201d Vesper said, and the dream wobbled and dropped into the dark like a bucket into a well because the mountain had rolled in its sleep and Liora woke with the taste of green in her throat. Bramble breathed at her cheek in the uncomplicated way of animals who have made one decision and will make it for the remainder of their lives. Elyse snored once and then refused to admit it even to herself. Corin slept on his side with his hands in his belt, a quirk of men who grew up in houses where someone might take what they wanted if they were not careful.\n\nThey broke camp before the light had made all its arguments, because mountains are kinder before the day remembers it could become hot. The sheep-path gave up pretending to be a path and was honest about being a suggestion. The birches let them go with a sentiment Liora could not put into any word she wanted to write down because it was fondness mixed with reluctance mixed with a small ungenerous wish that they might turn back just so the birches would be the ones to have kept them safe. Beyond, the world opened into a shallow bowl of rock and scrub and low thorn where a woman sat on an overturned bucket beside two hives that had been built into the mountain itself, combs sunk into the crevices like books into a shelf. The bees moved in peculiar figure-eights. Liora breathed in and the air had the caramel-bitter of buckwheat and the knife of resin.\n\n\u201cDo they fall when you light them,\u201d Elyse said dryly under her breath, and then ducked when a bee took offense, because bees are never fans of sarcasm.\n\n\u201cThey do as they please,\u201d the woman said, without turning her head, and Liora knew at once that she was one of the old witchers of the north, not because she wore anything that claimed it, not because she had a staff or a bunch of rosemary tied to her belt with red thread, but because the mountain had the look of having agreed to sit with her out of respect and maybe a little fear. \u201cIt\u2019s you, then. The one with a lake in her pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a jug,\u201d Liora said, and the woman smiled but did not show her teeth which told Liora more than if she had. \u201cWe were told the Glean is unkind to words.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs are most places that have been told what to be for too long,\u201d the witcher said. She tapped the side of the hive with her nail and a different note answered from within, a small bell whose clapper had been oiled. \u201cVesper has not only opened the Spire. She has opened the Resonatory under it. It is an old room. It teaches anything inside to learn the song that the sky sang when everything began. The song is not meant to be sung by people. People who listen to it too long either stand up taller or fall over and take the room with them when they go. She has set it ringing. That is what you hear when the river runs wrong. It is the planet trying to hum along. It is doing a poor job. Planets have no ear for music.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been sitting here,\u201d Corin asked, and his respect made his voice quiet.\n\n\u201cSince before your grandfather wanted to marry the sea,\u201d the witcher said, not as a riddle but because she could not help but put time into family. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a Spire go dark and take three years to be lit. I\u2019ve seen men try to stop it with hammers. They broke their hammers and their hands and went away praising the noise and cursing it in the same breath. I have honey that will make you see the color of wind if you lick it off a knife. I have honey that will make you remember your mother\u2019s anger click when you shut a door. I have none that will make you safe. But I can tell you where the argument in the Glean is thinner. Go under the black rock shaped like a bear. When you come to the place where the wind tries to be your father, befriend it and then betray it quickly. And do not let the mountain make you believe you were born for the sole purpose of being a witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fond of betrayal,\u201d Liora said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would make a good partner for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen trick the wind into being your sister instead,\u201d the witcher said, and finally turned her head and looked full at Liora and her gaze was a taste of metal against the tongue. \u201cYou are very tired. The Spire is a magnet and you are iron. Do not be surprised that you point north. But know you can be turned by a touch. Do not let anyone but your own hand lay hold of you.\u201d\n\nBramble stuck his nose toward the hive and then decided this was an arena where bravery would be a bad dog\u2019s kind of bravery. He lay down beside the witcher\u2019s boot and thumped his tail and the witcher, without looking, put her heel against his ribs so he would know he had been counted and approved. Liora exchanged a piece of news for a piece of honey that was the color of a good bruise. The news she gave was that the lake in Woodlake had started trying on different shapes. The witcher took that and set it in her lap as if it were a thing that might begin to move on its own and then she waved them off with the back of her hand with the economy of an old woman who did not need to bless anyone; her existence did enough.\n\nThe bear-rock did in fact look like a bear, but only if you had first made your mind up to see bears in rocks in the manner of children and poets. The Glean hove up around them, though that is not what the Glean looked like; it looked like a notch that had been taken out of the world by a god who needed to measure something and had lost the piece. The wind there did not go across or around. It went up from the ground as if the world were a kettle and the lid did not fit. Liora put her mouth to Corin\u2019s ear at one point, which is something she would not usually have done because his ear had the dignity of a plum, and said, \u201cNo words.\u201d He nodded and pressed his lips together as if the wind might otherwise go in and rummage through what was stored there.\n\nThey moved as if they were not moving, which is the only way to pass a place like the Glean where movement calls attention to itself and the wind wants to applaud. Twice they stepped on words that had been left behind by people who might have thought they were done with them. One word was \u201calmost\u201d and it snagged at Liora\u2019s boot-lace and tried to pull her down into a promise she did not want to make. She stepped out of it the way you step out of a puddle that has become deeper than it promises. One word was \u201cforever,\u201d which lay like a loose board across a gap. Elyse looked at it with ruthless affection, the way you look at a friend who has become inconvenient at a party, and she held out a hand to Liora and they stepped across together, not because the word wanted them to but because their bodies did it as one unit and the word was too surprised to object.\n\nAt the far lip of the Glean the wind tried to be their father, exactly as promised, and it said in the tone of fathers everywhere who have learned worry earlier than most, You will be hurt if you continue. Liora leaned into it and thought of the rejoinder that would leave it chastened and then she did not say it because even if it had been a good line the wind would have taken it from her and used it on some child who did not deserve to be bossed. She put her palm up and the wind put its palm against hers and then she ducked and went under as if it were a low lintel and she had been trained from childhood to avoid doorframes that liked to crack skulls. The wind huffed and then went on about its business with dignity. Corin went under as if bowing to an unworthy magistrate. Elyse went under like the letter S.\n\nThey came, toward evening, to a place where a piece of wall had grown out of the ground for no reason anyone could name, three courses of old stones with lichen and an arrangement of mason-marks that made Corin smile in his bones. Someone had hung a coat there\u2014the black of the roadmen\u2014and beneath the coat a strip of leather with writing burned into it with a heated nail. It said: Two went up. One fell in love with the green and won\u2019t come back. One is still counting. If you pass him tell him we will set his plate by the stove and he is not to become clever. Corin put his fingers on the marks reverently and then he put his forehead against the stone and Liora looked away because sometimes reverence is not for audience. Elyse read the line about becoming clever and rolled her eyes and said, \u201cMen become clever for the same reason women buy sugar: because they think it will sweeten something that doesn\u2019t want to be sweetened and then it ends up everywhere and you\u2019re sticky all day.\u201d Liora kissed her cheek without planning to. The look Elyse gave her afterward was complicated and interesting and very much like the look of a woman who had not meant to step on a word like forever and had done it and then stepped off again later and still noticed the damp mark on her shoe. They did not discuss it and that was all right for that minute and perhaps not for other minutes to come.\n\nThey made their beds that night under a dripstone that had tamed itself into a ledge where no drip had fallen in at least a century. The Spire\u2019s glow was stronger and did not pretend to be anything but a summons. Campfires moved along the far flanks of the valley like eyes. Liora could tell which fires belonged to those who had gone up for the thrill because their flames sawed at the air and the smoke ran in excited lines. There were fires that belonged to those who had been paid in coin and there were fires that belonged to those who had been paid in grief. She put the Night-Tears in the ground by the dripledge and pressed the soil over them firmly because seeds like a firm hand. She poured a spoon of water and then another because you never know what you will regret not watering later. \u201cIf we come back this way,\u201d she told them, \u201cbe either up or gone. Sleeping seeds give me a worse resentment than men who explain lock mechanisms to me while holding my own keys.\u201d\n\nBramble took the watch of his choice, which is to say the middle one where nothing rational happens and everything else does, and he did it by sleeping with one paw on each of their ankles so that if someone moved the dog would know right away. Liora lay and listened to the green, which had become a buzzing now, not mechanical, not bee, more like the sound a raven makes in your throat when you try to call it and it decides it will come to you because you are ridiculous and need to be humored. Just before sleep took her all at once there was the sound of a man coming up a slope with no care for stealth and yet no foolish noise either. She sat up so fast her cloak tried to strangle her because it was a garment that resented haste. Corin woke with his hand already on the small hammer that took the place of his temper when he could not find it. Elyse had a knife in her hand before anyone else\u2019s eyes knew to see her hand.\n\nHe came into the circle of their watch-light and set down his pack and in the pack\u2019s leather there was a river stitched, which is how you know a knight who rides water when he does not ride horses. He had an oar in one hand and a spear in the other, which is an elegant and absurd way to walk through a mountain. He was young enough to have hope in his eyebrows and old enough to have folded his boyhood and put it away without looking at it lately. He grinned at the dog first, because any man who denies a dog is a man who will deny himself later and should be corrected by the next convenient aunt. Bramble, who knew nothing of knights but knew how to weight a lap, climbed into the knight\u2019s lap like it had been built to his specifications.\n\n\u201cShade sends regards,\u201d the river knight said, and he sat where Bramble had insisted and the seat became a throne even though it was a rock. \u201cHe says to tell the mountain if it trips you it will answer to him and then he laughed like he laughs when he has just put a spear through a fish who thought itself cleverer than any man alive. I am Tern. I came early because a roadman passed our boathouse and his letter had news in it that would go stale if the sun touched it twice. They say Vesper has called a wind from under the Spire that counts. It is counting down.\u201d He opened his hand and there on his palm was a little disc of hammered tin that had been rubbed with charcoal and counted upon by a nervous thumb. There were nine marks in a circle and one had been smudged as if it had been erased by a rude hand. \u201cThey say tomorrow it will be eight. Shade says to tell you if you mean to stand there and say no you had better have the kind of no that does not blow away in a strong breath.\u201d\n\nLiora put her fingers to the tin and the tin was warm and then it was cold because she was frightened and her body had not known it properly until now. The mountain made the sound of an animal remembering it was hungry. The green light shifted and put a shawl around their shoulders and then threw it off again as if it had been scolded for acting familiar. She looked at Corin and Elyse and Tern and at Bramble, who had settled on Tern\u2019s knees with the certainty of saints, and she thought she would try to sleep again because there would be less time to be afraid if she did. The willow lay along her spine like a hand. The world counted and somewhere, in the notch of an old drum, the lake kept time with the sort of patience that is not kind and not unkind, but simply is. She closed her eyes and kept them closed even when the wind said her name in a voice she might once have called beautiful and would never call anything again except hungry.Morning did not so much arrive as rub its eyes and sit up with a groan, and every rock for half a league made the same slow sound of finding its joints. The green light from the Spire had softened while they slept, as if it too had needed to blink. Tern was already on his feet when Liora pushed out of her blanket, the tin disc on his palm held up to the light like a small moon being judged. One of the charcoal tics had become a smear that would not quite wipe away, and in its place the emptiness felt like a mouth breathing. He turned it so it would catch the shadow of his thumb and looked relieved to see that the missing mark had not crept back in the night and made liars of them all.\n\n\u201cIt took one,\u201d he said in the tone of someone announcing that a rival had stolen a spoon. \u201cShade says he\u2019s never liked a count he cannot argue with. This one does not argue back. It simply goes on with its business.\u201d\n\nLiora put her hand over his and the metal kissed her skin with the faintest sting, like a nettle that wanted to be polite. She did not think there was a device in it any more than there had been a device in the lake when it threw itself on the dock like a friend who has learned wrestling. It felt like the tin was being taught to be less tin. The willow leaned in its quiet way toward the disc and did not hum so much as clear its throat delicately. In the long list her mother had taught her\u2014Count spoons. Count people. Count the cows twice if they are all in the same field because cows have ambitions\u2014Liora had never been taught what to do about a count that did not belong to anyone and still ruled the air.\n\nThey ate a poor breakfast with the solemnity of a feast. Bread, which had decided in the night to lose an argument with damp. Cheese, which did not care what anyone thought of it. Honey from the witcher that stained their tongues briefly with the color of pewter and then changed its mind and let them have the color of summer. Bramble disposed of pebbles and twigs with dedication and eyed the cheese as if it were a badger he would eventually befriend through persistence and flattery. They stamped the last of the fire to ash and Liora, because it felt proper, told the ash, \u201cStay, if you can,\u201d and the ash said nothing because ash is the least sentimental substance in the world.\n\nThey kept to the line of the wall that had climbed out of the earth like an old thought that wanted to be looked over one more time. The man who had promised not to become clever had not left the vicinity; they found him one bend on with his back against a slab and his eyes as steady as a pair of stones in a river. He did not look up as they came near; he was counting, and not in numbers that belonged to money or sheep. He counted in breaths that forgot where their edge was. Liora heard the rhythm first and then the numbers under it and then the absence of any number that would be useful to a merchant. He was saying the days since he had come up, and the days since any person had tried to touch him, and the days since the wind had said his name and he had said no.\n\n\u201cDo you want a piece of bread,\u201d Elyse asked, and because she spoke without trying to be kind, only trying to be correct, he looked up and took it from her hand and forgot once where his count had been and flinched at the lost place like a man who has been told to stop in the middle of a drumbeat. Tern sat down beside him as if they were cousins and put the tin on his knee. The counter\u2019s gaze slid to it and snagged and he made a small hurt sound through his teeth.\n\n\u201cIt will be eight before dark,\u201d he said. \u201cEight is a fair number. It makes neat halves and quarters, and when you split it you feel you\u2019ve done something tidy. It pretends to be friendly, and in that it is treacherous, because it is no more our friend than nine, which is a boastful number, or seven, which is a number that believes in its own stories. I have been trying to convince the wind to stop counting there, because eight makes men put their tools away and tell themselves there is time, and then they go to sleep and never wake up. The wind keeps learning the wrong lessons from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens when it reaches nothing,\u201d Corin asked, and then did the politeness of saying, \u201cForgive me. We\u2019ve none of us ever liked to say that word.\u201d He tapped the stone with his knuckles and the stone answered him with the hollow ring of a thing that is thinking about counting too.\n\n\u201cIt will try to do the new thing,\u201d the man said, and wiped the heel of his hand along his jaw as if there were a word stuck to it and he\u2019d like it gone. \u201cWhen a child gets to the end of a set of stairs he will sometimes leap. It\u2019s like that. There are those who will tell you it will be like unclasping a necklace that has been strangling our necks for a thousand years. There are those who will tell you it will be like opening your own mouth and pulling your heart out to see if it still moves. Vesper says both on alternate days, and she believes herself each time.\u201d\n\nLiora crouched. She had not noticed until she was close that the man had a string around his wrist, just as the boy at the gate had. It had been tied too tight and had bitten him in. She slid a nail under the knot and loosened it without asking. He did not blush at the kindness and that told her he had been up here longer than his beard suggested. \u201cWill you come back down when your count is done,\u201d she said, and waited through the panic that rose in him like heat off a forge.\n\n\u201cIf I come down it will mean I have not mistaken the wind\u2019s voice for the voice of God,\u201d he said, as if he were reading from a letter echoed back to him. \u201cIt will mean my wife will know she is a widow only in the way she likes, not in the way people in this part of the world mean it. It will mean I will confess that I cannot keep a thing from happening by naming the steps that lead to it, and I have always liked to believe in the strength of names.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome down for your supper,\u201d Tern said, practical as salt. \u201cYour plate is by the stove and your friends told me to tell you to wash your hands before you touch it. There\u2019s a child who sits on the stoop who asks if the green is as green up here as it looks from there. He only has the one question and he has been saving it for you. If you don\u2019t come down I will tell him it is half the green he thinks, because spite is good for the young.\u201d\n\nThe man smiled despite himself, and in that smile Liora saw a person who had once been able to dance on a slant floor and not worry about grace. He stood very carefully as if he were afraid he had become the hinge on which the mountain swung and did not want to creak. When he had proven his bones still belonged to him, he lifted his eyes toward the Spire and bowed to it like a fellow with respect for a thing he does not admire. \u201cKeep your words,\u201d he said to Liora, \u201con a string you can pull back. She is good at stealing. She will not take from your pockets. She will take with compliments.\u201d He started down the path with the walk of a man who has remembered he is very tired and very hungry, and at the curve he looked down and called, \u201cIf you see the one who fell in love with the green, tell him I said he is not to be clever either and that I am not angry, only disinclined to forgive a man who chooses a color over a spoon.\u201d\n\nThey did not encounter the green-eyed deserter. They did meet three youths with bees stitched in gold along the sleeves of their jackets, which would have looked like a joke if the jackets had not been smeared with real pollen. The youths had been given a task and were taking it devoutly: they were catching loose words in long cotton bags and smacking the bags smartly against rocks until the words were stunned enough to be carried to their new hive. Each time they opened a bag, a sentence would fly out and make a bright angry sound like a letter caught in a door. One of the sentences said, Let me go you fools, and Elyse, who had been about to praise their ingenuity despite herself, shut her mouth and went fierce.\n\n\u201cYou do not bag a sentence like that,\u201d she told the tallest, who wore his hair with a carelessness that had to be practiced. \u201cYou put it down on the table and pour it tea and tell it your friend died once and the sentence will sit and look at you and become quieter. Then you can use it again. You do not beat it against a rock. Words remember. Treat them as if they had a spine.\u201d\n\nThe tall youth looked chastened and then made a face as if being told to be gentle with an abstract thing had pressed the bruise of his own daily fear too hard. He took the bag down and opened it and the sentence shot out and stood in front of Elyse like a crow that will come to your shoulder if you do not look at it directly. It tilted its head and thought about pecking and then it hopped and settled itself inside the open space of her hand, which is a thing some sentences will do if you have never lied to yourself about why you are using them. Elyse shut her fingers. \u201cSit,\u201d she told it, as if it were a dog. It did.\n\nThere were camps now, not just the scatter of small fires but proper camps like a braid of thought woven around a difficult idea. One camp belonged to the masons, and in it men and women with poor knees and excellent backs whittled the corners of blocks that hummed when you touched them, which is a reason to be gentler with corners than you might be. One camp belonged to the witchers and there were charms hung like laundry between poles and every charm had something in it that had once been alive and had given up gracefully. One camp belonged to those who came because they loved spectacle. There were banners there that swore by colors and made no mention of names, and Liora felt a homesick ire rise up in her throat, because color is what we have left when we have spent all our names and she did not like to see it put to wages. Tern walked through all of it with the bored air of a man who has escorted casks past a great many parties and knows he will do so through to the end of his days and will neither join nor condemn.\n\nAt the edge of the last of the makeshift cities there was a long low building that had not been there three days ago because the grass under it still had the shape of its former intent. It was all glass that had found a way to become a wall again after years of having forgotten how, and through the glass Liora saw a room lined in blue stone. Men and women at the far end stood at a bank of things that were not quite instruments and not quite dolls. They moved their hands through frames of light and their hands came away smelling like rain. In the very center, beneath a dome that had been polished to the verge of offense, a column of not-light rose out of the floor and made the hairs on Liora\u2019s arms leap to attention. For a breath she was back at the lake, but this time the view did not close itself off when she moved. She touched the glass with her forefinger and the glass took her pulse and held it to its surface like a coin pressed under a piece of paper and rubbed with graphite.\n\n\u201cShe has opened another of the rooms,\u201d Corin murmured, his mouth so near the glass that his breath came back at him with a stranger\u2019s smell. \u201cWe were told there were rooms under the Spire where the old ones taught themselves to be worse than gods and better than accidents. That one\u2019s a tuner. It\u2019s teaching itself how to make a note that will untie a knot.\u201d He looked ill now, not because he did not love work but because he did love it and this was work that took the floor out from under his feet and told him swimming was work too and how had he not known.\n\n\u201cDoors,\u201d said a woman at Liora\u2019s shoulder, and Liora realized she had come up and stood very close indeed to a person who did not look like she meant to ever be far away from any event. The woman\u2019s hands had scars on the palms that meant she had once grabbed a rope that did not want to be grabbed, and the rope, being a rope, had taught her its opinions. \u201cThey\u2019re all doors, these rooms. We had to kick at this one until it decided kicking was conversation. I nearly broke my foot, which made me laugh, which made the room offended in a way that told me it had a sense of humor it wasn\u2019t using.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it matter to it if we go in and admire the furniture,\u201d Elyse asked. She had put her palms flat to the glass as a test of whether the room would be rude enough to touch back. It did not. It let her feel nothing at all, which was a different sort of rudeness. \u201cWill it be kinder if we tell it it\u2019s pretty.\u201d\n\nThe woman grinned, the kind of grin that made Liora think of her mother\u2019s friend who could turn any lock with the hairpins she wore for decoration. \u201cIt will be kinder if you do not expect kindness. It will be more honest if you address it like a beast who could chew your hand off but is too full to bother if you speak nicely. Are you the wood lake girl. Vesper says you have the sort of face people would confess to and then regret. She likes regret. It makes people tidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell your princess,\u201d Liora said, feeling the heat that came up her neck when she was told she had a face that did not belong to her, \u201cthat if she wanted my face here she should have come down and asked for it in daylight. She preferred the dark. That tells me the number of her bravery.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe prefers the stage where her audience listens,\u201d the woman said without malice. She had turned her injured hands over and was tracing the scars with the tenderness people reserve for proof they have lived. \u201cShe likes a bowl to speak into. The mountain is a good bowl. The sky will carry her voice to the snow. You will go up and say no in the way of people who have been taught to say no the first time they are asked and to say yes only after they\u2019ve decided on their own. That will bring her more joy than if you had said yes at once. Opposition makes a shape from nothing. If she likes you she will try to make you into a hinge.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a hinge,\u201d Liora said. \u201cI am wood. I may be planed smooth but I remember seed.\u201d It was foolish to tell that to a stranger in this place, and yet the stranger\u2019s eyebrows jumped in the way Corin\u2019s did when someone used a name for a tool correctly, and she nodded as if given a secret handshake that had been out of fashion for a hundred years.\n\nThey stepped away from the glass because it is never wise to stare too long at anything that pretends to be empty when it is full, and came into a corridor where a rope sang. It did so without being touched. It was strung between two posts that were not exactly posts\u2014more the notion of standing\u2014and the rope was plaited of something that had once looked like hair and now looked like iron that had remembered a childhood. The note it made was not a note any throat would want to make, but it threaded itself through Liora\u2019s teeth and then through the willow and tightened. The noise made Tern flinch and then he set his jaw and the jaw was the jaw of a man who has rowed upstream in flood and counted each insult the river had given him and added it to a store of debt he meant to collect when he had time.\n\n\u201cTouch nothing,\u201d Elyse said, which is the line of anyone who has had to clean up after men who pretend curiosity is a virtue unshared by others. Bramble sat with his occurrence of perfect behavior and made his ears do that little lift they did when he believed he had done something to deserve a fish. He had not. Liora bent without putting her hands near the rope and put her face very close so she could smell it. It smelled like storms and the inside of a library, and that unsettled her more than if it had smelled of blood. Knowledge has always had the ability to be misused, but the rope smelled like a thing that did not understand misuse, only use, and in that she had to respect it even as she wanted to put it in a cupboard and shut the door.\n\n\u201cYou made your lake sit down,\u201d said a boy behind them with blue snuff on his nose and a set of calluses that said he had been scolded by flint more than once in his life. \u201cCan you make this stop singing. It sings the tune my brother was given when he went into the river and did not come out, and I don\u2019t want to be told again what I already know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made the lake remember itself,\u201d Liora said. \u201cI can ask the rope to forget. Whether it does is the rope\u2019s business.\u201d She spoke to it with the palm of her hand, not by touching it\u2014her mother had taught her long ago that if you ask a cat to come you do not pursue it; you make yourself interesting and let the cat claim you. She made herself into the absence of sound for the length of one breath and then for the length of three, and then she let her breath out and the rope gave up a note that was lower and lazier, like a rest in a hymn. The boy cried once, short, and then stuck his fist in his mouth as if he had a tooth loose and did not want anyone to see.\n\nWhen they came up to the beginning of the black stairs that had been cut into the first skin of the Spire, a woman with a braid of hair so long it could have choked a river stood with a rod and tapped each boot as it passed. Corin watched carefully and saw that she was not counting people; she was telling the stairs the shape of each foot and asking the stone to see them as individuals rather than a mass. Masses are too easy to roll down a hill. Her rod was made of old bronze with a collar of jet, and the jet had a crack in it and through the crack you could see that it had learned to love being broken. She glanced at Liora\u2019s willow and at Tern\u2019s oar and at Elyse\u2019s knives and each time one object showed too much pride she tapped it, and the sound was the sound of a child being told to tuck in its shirt. Liora, who had never in her life obeyed a request to tuck in a shirt unless it pleased her, still found herself standing straighter.\n\n\u201cYou will want to stop two turns below the white shelf with the pigeons painted on,\u201d the woman said with a patience that had been purchased at decent cost. \u201cYou will not be able to help yourselves. The song is thin there and goes like sugar in tea. If you stop there, leave a part of yourself behind on purpose\u2014a hair, a nail paring, a curse\u2014so that when you come away the cliff does not keep more than its share. There are children that stand there all day licking the air. We push them off when we can. Vesper hates us for that and loves us for doing it when she cannot bear to. Do not leave your dog, for the love of anything you name. The Spire will convince itself it has become his mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would burn it down first,\u201d Elyse said in a tone that made the woman look at her properly and decide to like her at once.\n\nThe stairs were not innumerable. That was the worst of them. They could be counted, and anything that can be counted can be finished, and the knowledge that there was a top and that in reaching it they would be expected to be ready was a cruelty Liora would have liked to return to its sender. They climbed into light that had the taste of copper pennies. Once a white moth brushed Liora\u2019s cheek and was dragged backward by nothing she could see and turned in the air with an affronted dignity and tried again. Once a ladder leaned past them, made of light exactly as Saeth had said, and three men in harnesses climbed it as if they had always been climbing light. Once a woman in a smear of red paint came down past them without moving any muscle she did not need and said aloud to no one, \u201cWe will need another kind of link. We will need a braid that doesn\u2019t mind being forgotten by the hair that made it,\u201d and Corin made a note on his skin in pencil because there was no other paper that would please him more at this altitude.\n\nThey stopped two turns below the white shelf with pigeons right where the rod-woman had told them they would, as if the path had leaned out and made a place exactly Liora-shaped, and the song slid around their ankles and their wrists with the tenderness of a snake that has decided not to bite this once. Liora did as she\u2019d been told and pulled a hair and wrapped it around the head of a nail she carried in her pouch, then pressed it into a crack where the stone would think itself clever for hiding it. Elyse set down a curse, but because her curses were beautifully made and had all their seams turned and pressed, the wind could not find its way into it and so the curse sat there like a tidy hen until a passing mason lifted it up and put it in his pocket because it was a good one and he might need it later. Tern swore in the language river-men use when the keel staves and their hands are bleeding and then he cut the oath in half with his teeth and spat one piece to the left and one to the right and the wind had to split to fetch it and they walked through the gap. Bramble put his paw on Liora\u2019s boot to inform her a bee had gotten into his brain and was making him think about soup. She told him no with her eyebrows and he blinked three times and the bee left and went to bother a boy who did not have eyebrows his mother had taught to say no.\n\nThe white shelf had been painted with pigeons by someone who had either loved pigeons or hated them and Liora, who had never held a strong opinion on the subject, found herself full of a resentful affection for birds who did not know they were art. There were people there, just as the rod-woman had said, with their mouths open a little, faces relaxed in the way of people who have finally had the noise in their heads matched by a noise outside and found it a relief. Vesper had put a woman there with a bell and a pole and the woman went around and rang the bell in front of every mouth with a beat that said wake, wake, wake, and some did and some did not, and the bell-woman\u2019s mouth tightened in a way that said she would ring the bell until her hand fell off, and then ring it with the other hand. When the bell came near Liora it did not strike, and Liora thought: she told her to spare us this scolding, and the bell-woman\u2019s eyes flicked over and said: do not be flattered. Bramble, to whom bells are either toys or threats with nothing between, growled and then sneezed and the sneeze had a dignity that made two children laugh and then stop, embarrassed, because they had been given a new habit and had not yet learned where not to put it.\n\nThey reached the last turn and there, not waiting with ceremony or guard, stood Vesper. There was no crown. There were no bees. She had dirt under her nails. If you were hunting for theatricality you would have to go and find it for yourself and bring it to her, and she would decide whether to keep it. She did not say Liora\u2019s name. She did not say any name. She looked at Liora the way you look at a mirror that you sometimes hate because it shows you what you are doing to your own face.\n\n\u201cYou came quicker than I had thought,\u201d she said, and her voice was not winded at all. \u201cGood. We have been busy. You can be shown the proof and then you may say your piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had my ear to the water and my mouth full of your breath since you climbed,\u201d Liora said, and she stepped so that Elyse remained by her shoulder and Corin where he could see the corners of things and Tern with his spear which had been made of oak that had changed its mind and become iron and then back again twice. \u201cI have seen your rooms. I have watched the river men tie rocks to their boots so they would not be flung around by the laughter of the plain. I\u2019ve had a woman who loves witches more than they love themselves tell me you have set the Resonatory to ring. I have stepped through a patch of air that had become an argument. Is there any proof you could show me that could be more than the proof of being here.\u201d\n\nVesper laughed once, a small sound that went into the rock as if the mountain were a lover she had tapped on the shoulder. \u201cThere is the proof of pattern,\u201d she said, and she stood aside so that they could see past her into the mouth of the Spire. It had not had a mouth three months before. Now it had the kind of mouth old things have when they are tired of being closed. The stairs within were not stairs any longer; they were a slope made of interrupted light. It was not color; it was one of those not-lights, but arranged into planks the size of the shoulders of a careful man. It was the sort of thing anyone would be tempted to step onto and then think better of and then step onto anyway because the temptation of not tripping was too much.\n\nVesper led them without turning to make sure they followed. That angered Elyse irrationally and she did not say anything because she did not wish to watch Vesper turn and collect her words as if they were coins dropped by a careless rich woman. Corin lagged once by a little alcove where a piece of machinery sat that looked like a child\u2019s toy. It was glass spun around a spindle and when you blew across the top of it the glass sang with a human voice. A man was kneeling by it with his ear against it as if to hear a wound knit. He was crying in a fully engaged manner because whatever he had been told to fix was something no tool could reach, and that is the way men who love work cry when they finally are given proof that sometimes there is no work to be done except to stop.\n\nThey came into a room that Liora recognized without wanting to from the lake\u2019s first vision. Blue stone. A ceiling polished so diligently it had become insult. At the far end, two figures stood within a cage of light like a net turned inside-out. One of them was reciting the names of colors as if that would keep him where he was supposed to be. The other was counting down in a voice like the road at midnight. A column rose behind them, taller than any column has any right to be, and if you looked aside even a little it did not exist, and if you tried to grab it with your eyes it shoved your gaze down your throat and made it sit there like a badly chewed bite of meat. Along the wall, on low tables, lay maps that made the map in the room at Woodlake look like a child\u2019s paper crown, and Liora\u2019s heart leapt and hated itself for leaping because she adores a neat map more than many better people adore their own children. These maps were not drawn. They were a stitching of laid nerves. The mountain itself had been asked to provide its lines.\n\n\u201cOnce,\u201d Vesper said, and the room adjusted itself to a better listening shape as if it had leaned in, \u201csomething opened here. It was not a portal and it was not a mouth. It was a forgetting. Alderra forgot itself at this point exactly and began to be something else, and then it remembered itself poorly and was ashamed and put stones over the shame. People built shrines to the shame. That is what we always do. When grief grows its own ribs we hang medals on it and pretend we did that on purpose. The old ones\u2014call them the builders, call them the mothers, call them the idiots with room in their heads for everything but love\u2014made a set of rooms where they could come to push at the world. I have opened them. It was not hard. Locks are for people who wish to think they can stay out. Rooms wish to be rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it you wish me to see,\u201d Liora asked, and she put her hand behind her and found Elyse\u2019s wrist and wrapped her fingers around it and felt the pulse there insult the notion that anything large could make them small.\n\n\u201cThat the count is not me,\u201d Vesper said, and it was the first time she had said anything that felt naked enough to be true. \u201cI am not the song. I am the bell. I did not invent the river; I moved the rock that made the water change its mind. You will call me arrogant because it is easier to hate a person than a room. Do me the credit of hating the correct thing. If you must hate me, hate me later. We are at eight. We will be at seven by the time you have stopped holding your breath. Liora of Woodlake\u201d\u2014she said the name like it was the answer to a riddle that had satisfied her\u2014\u201cif you stand with me we can make the end a good one. If you stand apart we will still make it, but it will be uglier, because you will force me to be interesting, and I do not like being interesting when I work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no interest in helping you find a more elegant way to break the dishes,\u201d Liora said, and she was surprised to find her voice smooth and not dripping with all the things she would have liked to pour into it. \u201cIf you are not the count, it does not exonerate you from waking it. A man who shakes a sleeping hound and says, see, the hound has always had teeth, is a very fine sort of liar, and I would not trust him with my favorite shoe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d Vesper said, and for the first time her smile looked like it belonged to her and not to her idea of herself. \u201cTrust me with nothing. Bring your staff. Bring your dog. Bring your stubborn mind put together out of reeds and old paper and bake-oven heat. Stand opposite. We will make a shape between us that the world can lean on when it begins to tilt.\u201d She lifted her hand and the note in the room shifted and went through Liora\u2019s mouth and made it open a little. The taste was like ice and iron. It made her think of her mother\u2019s handwriting. It made her think of how it had felt to be told at ten that she would be a cupboard if she kept all her thoughts under lock and key. She swallowed and the taste went down and became something else in her belly that she would have to name later.\n\nTern had not spoken, and now he did. He spoke like a man who has stood on a boat that was not sure it wanted to be a boat any longer. \u201cIf we walk out of here and tell the mountain to sit, Will it sit. If we take our oars and push you off your little island will you fall. If we tell the count to go to hell will it go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can say hell in the right tone,\u201d Vesper said, and her eyes slid to him and away because he was not the one she wanted to be speaking to, \u201cyou can teach water to burn. I have no interest in stopping you from attempting. The work is already doing the work. I prefer assistance to opposition, but I am not above using opposition like a brick. Stand where you like.\u201d\n\nCorin breathed, finally, like a man who had forgotten it was an option. He laid his broad palm on the blue stone at his hip with the affection of one who speaks to walls at night when there is no person to hear. \u201cThere is a weakness where you have cut,\u201d he said, nosily, like a cousin who will not be silent at wakes. \u201cYour light-planks nest badly over that seam. You will fall through if a child jumps. You are proud enough to like to be warned well. Consider yourself warned.\u201d\n\nVesper\u2019s head tipped. Her mouth did a not-smile that Liora saw and recognized and disliked and could not help admiring because it was like her mother\u2019s when told someone had made a clever mistake. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and it carried no mockery, and at once a woman with a braid like rope and a man with a pencil tied to his wrist leapt into the net of light and fixed the seam as if it had insulted a guest. \u201cYou see, Liora. It is much better to have people around who do not wish to be here. They tell the truth as a matter of principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll choose a place,\u201d Elyse said briskly. She had not gone all small under the weight of the room and Liora took in a breath of her as one breathes at a window. \u201cWe\u2019ll choose a place to stand where your noise cannot hide our no. If you want us to save your work from your own cleverness, we\u2019ll send you an invoice. If you want us to keep children from standing in the sugar, we\u2019ll use our bell. If you want us to be your vanity\u2019s polishing-cloth, you may invent a better request.\u201d\n\nVesper inclined her head as one does when one has been spoken to by someone who knows the exact weight of her own refusal. \u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the column, not under it, where your dog won\u2019t be convinced he is the size of a bear. The count will be six by then. It may be five if the river in the west decides to practice running up hill again. Go and rest where the pigeons are painted. Even saints require soup.\u201d She lifted her hand and the room exhaled them. The light-ladders drew themselves up so they would not be stepped on as if by a child who doesn\u2019t want his toys muddied. Outside, the sky had been stained an earnest green that looked like vigor; you could fool yourself into thinking it was health. The tin in Tern\u2019s hand had grown cooler.\n\nThey found a place to make a day\u2019s home under a scarp from which roots trailed like hair washed and left to dry. The camps had learned to give them room not out of courtesy but out of mistrust that had agreed to try the shape of respect for an evening. Corin set stones in a small circle and spoke to them until they consented to be a hearth. Elyse set her knives in a line along the lip of the scarp with their blades toward the mountain, an impoliteness that would be understood by anyone with sense as a sign of watchfulness and not hostelry. Tern went to stand where he could see the river\u2014far to the east, a thread of metal that had taken an oath not to behave normally\u2014and he whistled once in a manner Shade would hear if a heron were the messenger. Liora unwrapped her packet with the seeds she had carried and looked at the little drawing of the bell-shaped bloom with its mouth shut and decided that even here, perhaps especially here, a bell with no mouth belonged.\n\nShe pressed three Night-Tears into the thin soil and tamped them down with the pad of her thumb. She told them a story about a boy with a piece of string around his wrist and his insistence that string could keep him from falling away. She told them about a dog who believed he could be the mother of any child if the child consented to be licked. She told them about a lake that had wanted to be a wall and had chosen instead to be a lake. She told them about a princess who did not like being given a place to stand by someone else but would stand there anyway if it meant keeping children\u2019s mouths shut when the sugar sang. The green over the world brightened because it liked stories when they were told by people standing with their backs to a cliff and their faces to the wind. Bramble lay with his chin on Liora\u2019s knee, and when his eyes rolled up to look at her there were a thousand small reflections of the Spire\u2019s light there, which is how you learn what kinds of lights your world has, because there is no mirror like a good dog\u2019s eyes.\n\nToward sunset, a sound came up from the very bones. It was not the count. It was an announcement. A drumming that had more joy in it than threat, more insistence than grace. Liora felt the beat take the shape of her chest and fit itself there like a hand. The pigeons on the shelf looked as if they might lift. Elyse\u2019s braids knocked like a clock. Corin\u2019s brow learned a new crease. Tern, who was dipping his tin in cold water to make it change its mind about being a witness for a moment, came up fast, water in his beard, and held the disc out like a plate to catch falling bread. There were seven marks left, clean and terrible, and there were not seven, because at that same beat the first of the marks blurred and went dark and made a confession: it had never been a mark, it had been a hole.\n\nThe mountain said, as mountains do when no one listens and so they speak to the very few who will, Prepare, and the word did not go into their ears but up through their feet. Liora put her hand on the willow and the willow shivered and became a little more than a stick and a little less than a tree. She did not look for Vesper in the doorway of the blue room. She did not ask the air how many times it had learned to be this particular shade. She looked at her companions and at the dog and she let the count settle in her bones and she named the numbers to herself in the language of her mother\u2019s ledger and of boys tying string. She named them in bread and in apples and in the steps between two stones. There was soup to be heated. There were knives to be sharpened. There were pigeons to not eat. There was a woman with a bell who would come if called and would ring her arm off because it is those with bells who save us. There were two nights perhaps, or one, or half a one.\n\nShe slept with all her faults on, because there is no point polishing your conscience when you intend to take it into a place where everything will be scratched. The wind came and it said her name again and she did not open her eyes. It said it prettier and she did not open them. It tried a harsher sound because it had learned a little of her and misapplied its knowledge and she laughed in her sleep because she owned that sound and no one else did. When she woke, the green had grown honest enough to be sickly, and the tin disc had made up its mind to show six. The mountain clicked. Somewhere in Woodlake, a dock creaked and Bramble\u2019s cousins barked at puddles too small to deserve barking. Liora tied her hair back with a piece of cord that had once bound three letters to a trout. She stood up into the day and found it waiting, as days will when they cannot wait any longer.The count wore six like a ring that fit too well, and everyone on the mountain felt their finger bones under it. Morning stretched itself into something braced, like a beam set under a roof that might decide to sag. Men sat in their shirts and boots and stared at steam as if it might give advice, and women plaited their hair tighter than they needed to, knots made as if to hold in thoughts that might otherwise leap away into the green. Liora woke with her mouth dry and a small sore spot on her cheek where the willow had pressed in the night; it had left a miniature crescent, a reminder that even friends make their marks when you sleep too close. Bramble had made a decision to be a stone and had placed himself across her ankles so that all the dreams that wanted to run away would have to ask him for permission first. When she eased free he rolled to present a ribcage and made the sound that meant he would forgive her for absolutely everything if she engaged with his fur for half a minute with all the intensity of princes at councils. She obliged, and the morning decided it wouldn\u2019t be able to knock her entirely awry while she still smelled like dog.\n\nIt turned out that Shade had sent two, after all. The second river knight came up with a little boat on his back, a thing so narrow and quick it looked like a blade that had elected to be a fish instead. He had carried it by a strap across his brow so that his hands would be free for the oar and for the spear, and he had the particular walk of a man who could go down anything without trusting his knees to stop him at the bottom. He set the boat down with care that made Corin smile despite himself and scratched Bramble without asking permission, because the boat had counted as an introduction. \u201cKite,\u201d he said, as if his name were a direction. \u201cShade says we\u2019re to keep anyone who doesn\u2019t belong out of the water, which is very funny given that all this is water pretending to be other things. Also this is for you.\u201d He drew a coil from the hollow under his boat\u2019s seat; it was a braid, three colors of rope twisted into one. It had the look of a thing that had been made in a hurry by someone who knew their hands too well to do it badly. It glinted along one side, and Liora saw that catgut had been spliced with river-reed with a single hair wrapped through, the hair so pale it might have been a light. \u201cWe heard someone say you\u2019d need a braid that doesn\u2019t mind being forgotten by the hair that made it. Shade told me to make one and then forgot he had. That\u2019s how I knew I\u2019d done it right.\u201d\n\nElyse took the braid as if she were accepting a baby who\u2019d been handed to her by a man who had never held one and was trying very hard not to drop it. She weighed it and ran it between her fingers, testing for arrogance. \u201cIt will slip when asked and hold when not,\u201d she said, eyes narrowed because praise is a delicate substance and must be applied evenly or it will run. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. That may be why it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nThe camps around them had already learned the new rhythm of the day. At first the green had been a novelty that made people talk too fast; now it was an imposition that made them wash their spoons with intent. The bell-woman had new assistants, boys too young and old women too stubborn, each with a smaller bell that had their own names burned into the handles so that the wind would know them and be polite when told to move. The masons took down a light-ladder and put up a real one in its place where the seam had sulked, because light is very clever until it forgets to be wood, and then it cuts your foot with its pride. The witchers moved their charmed laundry toward the shade because charms keep their temper better when not disappointed by heat. Vesper\u2019s people\u2014those who wore no color but wore all confidence\u2014carried out shrouds of wire that looked like music written down and looped them from post to post as if stringing a harp between two remarks. Liora watched them with a calm she had to construct from spare parts; each post looked like an opinion and the wires looked like the line every argument goes quiet along when both sides have said everything and the truth is still elsewhere.\n\nThey went to choose their place. It was not where Vesper had pointed, not exactly, because Liora had an animal\u2019s dislike of being placed, even by someone who meant well in her own deviant fashion. She took them three lengths to the west, where the blue stone rose into a sort of shoulder and then dipped, making a little cupped space with a view of the column through a lace of cables, and if you sat with your back to the rock you could see both the white shelf with its painted pigeons and the door where those carried by their own \u00e9lan stumbled and had to be turned gently. It felt like the spot on a hillside where a sheep looks out and decides which foolish lamb will need herding. Corin approved it at once because there were seams any honest wall would want to admit to if coaxed, and that meant he could talk to the stone without being impertinent. Elyse liked the angles because they made it easy to throw anything unwelcome downhill until it reconsidered its choices. Tern liked that there was a line of sight to the thread of the river out past the lower scree; he had a whistler\u2019s obsession with witnessing exit routes even when there was no chance of taking them. Bramble liked it because two pigeons were not painted but real, and had come to argue with their likenesses so loudly that the bell-woman had threatened to ring them without malice.\n\nThey staked their claim not with flags, which would have been vulgar, but with actions that look like ordinary accidents. Corin sat and made a circle of stones and persuaded them to stay put despite their natural inclination to roll away in the exact hour a foot needed them. Elyse set the braid in a figure-eight between two rock-lips so that anyone coming in quick would trip on their certainty and not on the rope. Tern laid his oar along the ground and spoke to it, and though it was a piece of wood made for water and not for earth, it consented to listen, because there is no river like the air when it moves in ranks. Liora knelt in the dust and drew with the foreshaft of a reed. Her hand made the gesture the willow had taught her\u2014hello and sit married together\u2014and she wrote a long line that came back to itself and did not tie a knot. A man from Vesper\u2019s side came and stood very near and watched and made a mark on a slate as if she were a creature in a tank. She looked up and held his gaze until his hand did something embarrassing with the chalk and then she smiled in the polite manner people reserve for those watching a dog swim who have never yet gotten their shoes wet. He went away with the expression of someone who would return hand in hand with an explanation later and stand exactly where he had stood before until she gave him a word he could put on a shelf in his head and dust each week.\n\nIt would have been better if the count had been shy. It would have been better if it had curled, refused to make an appearance in daylight like a drunk who knows the sun shows every lousy choice. It was instead upright and prompt and went down to five a little after the noon-bell, while men were drinking broth and women were scolding children for trying to lick the sugar-air in secret behind the white shelf\u2019s post. Tern\u2019s tin took on the ugly glamour of a mirror and everyone wanted to look and then not look and then look again. When he cupped it, he did so with both palms, and Liora found herself knuckling her mouth to keep from telling him to put it down because you never tell a man holding a thing that has chosen to be terrible to let go or he will think himself the only one allowed. The mark smeared, the hole showed, and the mountain raised its shoulders as if a story had just gotten good in the middle of something else.\n\nThe change touched the river first. It did not run backwards this time; it changed its mind about being a line. It lifted in three places like a boy\u2019s hair in a wind, and at those three places it made a sound between a laugh and a cough and then it lay back down with a shudder that made the fish jump without having meant to. A woman carrying a basket of small birds on her head\u2014an absurd thing to carry on a mountain unless you think the mountain will be hungry\u2014set the basket down in alarm and two of the birds leapt out and turned in the air as if they\u2019d been taught a new language and had to say hello at once. Children cried because any time the world performs, children cry with proprietary outrage. The bell rang. Elyse rang her own bell\u2014a piece of brass she had bought from a tinker who\u2019d sworn it had never been a cowbell in its life and had always been meant for better things\u2014and the tone folded under the Spire\u2019s note with a domestic firmness that reminded everyone within hearing of kitchens where harsh words are not spoken because they would fall into dough and make it tough.\n\nVesper appeared where people can appear if their feet know the floor. She had ink on her fingertips and something in her hair that might have been crystal powder or might have been flour if she had been very strange and had decided to bake under a column that wanted to undo all ingredients. She did not look at Liora directly, which was to her credit, and she did not look away, which was to it also. \u201cYou feel it,\u201d she said to the air between them because speaking to the precise place where a person stands is a power like stepping on their shadow and must be used rarely or you will crush those who would otherwise stand for you. \u201cThe pattern is not mine. I am not the hand. I am the tool in the hand. The old ones set it here as you set a key on a nail by the door. The planet has been trying to unlock it for years. It is patient. It is patient in the way of rot. It simply waits for the floorboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cTools choose,\u201d Liora said, and the willow hummed in agreement because wood knows the difference between a good hand and fools. \u201cYou set the Resonatory ringing. You built rooms that make people taller or make them fall. You put ladders of light up where stone used to be. Stone is a poor conversationalist and you have given it language. It is still your mouth speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what would you have me say, Princess of a lake that wishes to be a wall,\u201d Vesper asked, and now she looked full at Liora as if it would do neither of them good to pretend that this was not between them and that the mountain and the sky and the little green children were not merely audience. \u201cShall I speak the old apology. We did not know. We could not have foreseen. The consequences were unexpected. Spare me. Consequences are always the first thing to arrive and the last to be invited in. Come see the tuner again when the hour turns. We have nearly taught it a note that will let a seam weeps with grace rather than explode like anger. If you still wish to scold me, do it in front of it. It likes to hear women speak like door-frames.\u201d\n\nLiora did not go to the tuner. She had known children who learned to fold paper into little boats and then, because they were clever, could not resist setting those boats floating in puddles that belonged to other people\u2019s houses. There is never a conversation to be had with a cleverness about not setting it in the water, only about where the puddle is and whether the puddle\u2019s owner will come out and say a word that will make someone cry. She sat with her back to the rock and the willow laid along her thigh and she watched the painted pigeons with their round foolish eyes and thought of the woman with the braid telling her to leave a hair in the crack so the cliff would not steal too much. She pulled a hair and tied it around her wrist, not to keep herself from falling up, though the old witches would have laughed and told her it would do that too if she asked, but to remind herself that her hand belonged to her when she put it forward. Elyse did the same because she had always liked Precaution, a goddess of no one\u2019s pantheon who could be called simply by saying her name around a small danger.\n\nCorin had found his work among Vesper\u2019s people whether any of them liked it or not. Two of the light planks had learned to scoff and he did not stand for that sort of goings-on in load-bearing structures. He banged and murmured and stood like a post and waved a boy back from some enthusiasm and lent a woman his pencil and took from her a nail that he put politely in his mouth because he\u2019d no other pocket. The light planks stopped scoffing, which is a good first step in both carpentry and conversation. Kite took a watch without being asked and made himself a silly boy for the children on the white shelf, turning his boat upside down and putting it on his head and calling himself a turtle while the bell-woman frowned and then failed to hide her smile in her apron. Tern drifted toward any place there was a container. He had a way of looking at jars that made them behave themselves and of untying knots without moving his hands.\n\nIt came on them like weather that has sent a letter ahead of itself and then arrives precisely when it promised and still shocks because we never really believe things will happen when they say they will. The air put its teeth together and then unclenched. The tin clicked. The mark that was not a mark let go the shape of five and showed the hole shaped like less of a hand. Men made that sound they make when their finger hammers their thumb. Women made the sound that says here we are, here we are. The ground wanted to go down and up in the same breath and had to choose and resented the choice. Vesper set her palm to the blue stone and spoke in an undertone and the undertone had in it the night that comes over ash plain when all the heat of the day stands up and walks away on little legs.\n\nThe first rift opened not in the sky but in a story. A woman who had come because her sister had gone up and never sent a line home stood at the edge of their little chosen place and began to tell what she had told herself was true about her sister\u2019s reason for staying away. Halfway through it, the story tore. It did not become false; it became afraid. The words stuck together like bread dough too wet and she made a helpless motion with her mouth as if trying to spit out a thread. Liora touched the back of the woman\u2019s neck with two fingers and thought of the river-man\u2019s tin and of the willow at the dock and of the way people who have never met can sometimes teach each other not to drown. She said one word that isn\u2019t a word, the one you say when a kettle boils over and it would be tragedy to let the soup go away. The tear mended. The sister came in it\u2014that is, the shape of her came\u2014scratching her nose as if this were all irritating rather than the end of a world. The woman cried in the mean, fierce way of those who have refused to cry for six years and now are obliged. Elyse turned away and cut air with her knife because sometimes if you do not cut something the cry goes into you and lodges like a fishbone and is only taken out by pity when you don\u2019t want it there.\n\nThe second rift opened in the rope, singing. It rose out of its posts like a snake tired of being a line. The note climbed in a hurry and the boys with their blue snuff looked suddenly both eager and ashamed. The rope tried to teach the note to a flock of things with wings that were not birds but had taken notes well and meant to be helpful. The wings fluttered wrong and the note went ragged as a cough. Liora did not try hello and sit this time. She walked to the edge and held out her wrist with the hair around it. She did not touch the rope. She held the ordinary up to the extraordinary in the way of women who have placed a loaf on a table where three bad ideas have been arguing and said there. The rope laughed. There is no other word for it. It fell back onto its posts with a thud like a brother thrown onto a bed that belongs to him and remembered that it had been made to keep two things in their proper regard, not to be a bird-school.\n\nBy midafternoon everyone\u2019s patience was a little thin as old shirts get thin along the back. Bramble had acquired a troop of followers, the kind of children who attach themselves to animals with a sense for their own dignity and who develop at speed a philosophy of goodness that involves crumbs. He led them around three holes and into two that were not holes at all but places where stepping would remind you who you had been in a different year and that might or might not improve your day. He took pride in each triumph and forgot each failure like a saint who has been told not to keep score. He visited the bell-woman with a pinecone held as if it were a valuable that must be appraised. She dinged the cone with the edge of her bell, merry despite habit, and said unsuitable for purchase and put a ribbon around it so the child who had found it could go home and tell his mother he had acquired goods.\n\nThere is a limit to how many times a mountain can ask its bones to be revised before something old in it sits up on its hind legs and has its say. Toward evening when the light went less green and more the color of certain bruises on certain fruits, a fault spoke. Corin felt it before anyone else because he had his hands in the seam in the stone and he had been listening to its grievance like a priest. His mouth shaped an oath that would have been worth writing down in a book for future use and he looked up and said without raising his voice, \u201cThe shelf,\u201d and everyone who needed to hear it did. The white shelf where the pigeons had been painted had never been meant to carry any weight larger than its memory of birds. It had been gracious for two days. It had been bullied for one. It had been flattered for three hours. It made up its mind to drop its shoulders.\n\nLiora and Elyse arrived first, which is not to say faster but to say that their steps made the kind of argument the stone preferred. The pigeons\u2014those painted, those real\u2014had enemies among the children and friends among the same, and all of them would be under those condescending birds if the edge let go. The bell-woman had her pole ready and she had her bell raised, but she could not ring and hold at the same time, and her eyes told Liora that she had lived a life of ringing and holding and it had made her simply tired. Tern ran into the breath of everybody\u2019s breath with his oar and set it under the lip of the shelf and put his shoulder under the oar and drew a breath down past his ribs into wherever he kept river in his body. Kite came next with the boat and a curse that had been taught to him by a man with both ears pierced twice. They shoved the boats up against the safest place of the unsafe thing because sometimes you put an impossible object between a falling rock and a little skull and the world says all right then and remembers itself long enough to not be tragedy. Corin shoved stones like old pigs until they nestled. Elyse took the braid and looped it around a stump of something that had once been iron and now thought itself a plant and made a figure-eight so quick her fingers blurred, and then she turned and looked at Liora with all the expectation of someone who knows where her own work ends and has eagerly forgotten where yours begins.\n\nIt is a terrible power and a terrible risk to be a person whose trick is reminding. Liora put her palm flat to the pigeons because she could not catch the shelf as it was. She could only catch what it had been. She thought of the painter who had stood there on a day that wasn\u2019t this one and made little dabs with a brush and considered whether pigeons might look better if their necks had too much shine, and she thought of the person before the painter who had cut the ledge, not with grand plans for worship but to have a place to sit and put off a shoe and shake a stone into their hand. She thought of the winter when no one came, because people had had coughs, and the shelf had done what shelves do when no one sees them: experienced itself with small satisfaction at not being a path. She thought of the rock under that rock and the muscle of mountain that had been made before names and that had never been told to behave in a room. She said to it, not in any tongue: you are a thing that holds. She let her breath out very slowly so that the breath could be the rope when ropes lie. Elyse\u2019s braid bit. Tern\u2019s shoulder groaned and did not move. Kite\u2019s boat made a stayed sound that boats make when they do the job of houses and resent it secretly. The shelf jerked and then sat, sulky as a child told to sit behind a line until the game says run. The pigeons looked offended and then, being pigeons, adjusted. The children came down from the sugar with their mouths closed in that specific satisfaction of the rescued annoyed by their own gratitude. The bell-woman put down her bell long enough to press the heel of her hand to Liora\u2019s cheek with a mother\u2019s attention that took the sore spot there between thumb and forefinger and rubbed it as if it belonged to her. \u201cSoup,\u201d she said, because some words are spells.\n\nThey went back to their place under the scarp with their whole bodies shaking like metal that has been struck, and Liora did what she can do in such moments: she made a list. She thought it in the order her mother would approve. People saved. Where they will sleep tonight. Knives not put away where they should be. Bells that will need new clappers. Stones to be thanked whether or not anyone else thinks it proper. Dogs to be praised beyond what the occasion merits so that later you can be stern without offense. She spoke the list aloud only to the willow and to the seeds under the dirt near her knee, because seedlings are the oldest audience and never gossip. Bramble put his chin on her ankle and wriggled until his eye was looking straight up her skirt in that unthinking doggish way that ought to have been a scandal and only made her laugh in a little frightened stutter that let something out of her throat she had not known she was holding.\n\nAt dusk the tuner sang. There was no other way to think of it. Its note, which had been an engineering, became a voice, and the voice did not belong to any person. It was clean the way a knife is clean when someone else has sharpened it too much. Vesper stood with her back to the room where the column stood. She let the note touch the front of her like rain, and her mouth quirked as if the rain had guessed a secret and there was sport in being found out. The count slid with the unfunny grace of a spoon through stew and became four. The breath went out of a hundred chests at once and back in, and on the exhale the mountain burped, with all the embarrassment of something so old doing something so undignified. Far under them, maybe under the black roots of the Black Spire itself, something in the rock went loose and turned, and the sound it made was like someone\u2019s grandmother clicking her tongue against her teeth at a bad joke told to a child.\n\nIn the half-light between then and full night a woman came up the path with a bundle wrapped in a coat. She was thin in the way of people who have eaten all the good things and then given them away, and her mouth had taken to making lines that were not expressions, just evidence of weather. She came straight to Liora because that is the problem with becoming a subject in a story that is being told before it is finished; people know where to find you. She put the bundle on the ground and opened the coat and there was a baby in it who had seen three hours of the changed green and had come to the conclusion it would sleep through it if no one objected. It breathed with authority. It had eyebrows that belonged to its father and a chin that belonged to the stone. \u201cHe was born when it went to four,\u201d the woman said, and it was the voice of a person who had not decided yet whether to be proud or angry that her child would have this sort of drama in his pocket for the rest of his life. \u201cTell me. Will he be all right.\u201d\n\nLiora knelt and put a finger under the baby\u2019s hand because babies are very firm in their opinions about whether your finger is a good place to rehearse holding. He gripped and released and gripped again in a rhythm that had nothing to do with the mountain and everything to do with his body\u2019s small chores. She looked at the woman and let her mouth be the place where truth is allowed to be kind. \u201cHe is born,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the kind of all right I can promise. He will make other all rights as he goes. None of them will be as important as the first one, which is the one he has already done. If you would like him to have a name that makes it easier for him to stand when all this is done, pick one with two syllables and a sound in the middle he can bite. Names like that go well with soup.\u201d The woman laughed, because the particular sort of person who laughs at soup-jokes is exactly the sort you need on a mountain that has decided to pretend to be a story, and she wrapped her baby up and went away relieved in the peculiar way of those who have not got any certainty and have chosen to like the shape of the uncertainty they\u2019ve been handed.\n\nThe Night-Tears sprouted at moonrise. Elyse whistled under her breath the way you whistle when a horse you do not own comes near enough to decide about. They had put up two leaves apiece as neat as any apprentice\u2019s first attempt at tidy handwriting, and at the heart of each leaf a small bell budded with its mouth tight shut. Liora had not expected it so soon and felt in the sprouting the trick that Vesper loved so much she had built a city out of it: if you do something at the right place and the right minute, everything will grow up immediately and you will feel like a god. She wanted to loathe the satisfaction and could not; she accepted it like a loan she would pay back with interest in times when nothing grew and the mountain sulked, and she put her palm over the little bells and whispered, \u201cNot yet. Not until ringing would be a kindness.\u201d\n\nSleep was a matter of closing eyes and then being told by every small thing you had met that day that it would like to review its notes with you at length. Liora went under anyway, carrying her fear like a child hip-carried, not because she loved it but because putting it down would only make it cry. The dream came, of course. It came and then hesitated like an actor at the edge of a light and then stepped in because no one had signaled it not to. Vesper was not in it. The lake was. It looked like itself and then, when it breathed, it looked like a chest and then like a mouth and then like nothing but water again, which is the kind of trick that keeps people living beside it forever and calling it their friend despite all the ways it can get you killed. It said nothing. It did not have to. It did what it had done at the dock and under her ear and once when she had been very small and had put both hands to its chill in a season when putting your hands into things was the fashion. It lifted her name and set it down and she felt what she had felt in front of the pigeons. Remembering. It isn\u2019t easy to teach stone to remember because it already remembers everything. It is easier to teach people that we remember incorrectly and should not let cleverness do our forgetting for us.\n\nShe woke when voices ran along the scarp like hares and leapt into their little hollow all at once. Tern had his hand on the spear and Elyse\u2019s fingers found her knife as easily as nails find teeth. Corin sat up and his pencil rolled out of his hair where he had stowed it and Liora caught it before it fell into a crack where she would not be able to retrieve it without crying. Kite peered out from under his boat with the face of a man who has learned that boats are good roofs but poor walls. It was not an attack. It was a rumor, the kind that wears boots. A boy panting and a woman pale and a man who had tried to keep his hands clean and failed three times. \u201cIt\u2019s gone to three,\u201d the boy gasped, his chest doing all sorts of nonsense. \u201cIt took two in one and we don\u2019t think we like that and the tuner is laughing and also there\u2019s a storm from the ground up which is wrong.\u201d He bent double, hands on his knees, and made a sound suspiciously like the bell-woman\u2019s bell, which is what happens when you live under a bell for a day and then try to have a body.\n\nThe tin was colder than it had been; whether it meant anything or was simply skin making stories of its own, Tern did not speculate aloud, which is one of the ways he is better than most men. He held it under the moon and everyone saw the hole that had been four become a hole that was not and the terrible surety of three take its place. The green did not get greener; it tired. It limped to the edges of things and waited there like a candle that knows its wick is a poor one but has hopes for the tallow. The air crawled like skin on a winter-night after a rumor of lice. Liora stood and looked toward the blue room because she knew that is where every story would be pinned when it ended, and then she chose not to go there. She went to the white shelf, because that is where the children had gone to lick sugar before and would again, and she went because if Vesper wanted her in one place she would be more useful a breath away, uncounted.\n\nOn the way she met the witcher of the bees, walking as if she had always known where this path would be when she was old. The bees were with her\u2014not all, just the ones who had names that could be spoken without dignity\u2019s loss\u2014and they wrote rude words above her head in gold for the green to swear by. The witcher had a knife on her hip and a smear of something moss-colored across her mouth like a kiss from a hill. \u201cIt begins,\u201d she said, not in a grand voice or a frightened one. \u201cThe rooms that teach the sky to sing will have their say and then they will subside, because everything does. This is not about gods. This is about habit, and your Vesper has given the world an idea so strong it will go until it is exhausted, and then it will fail. We will live in the failure. It will be ugly like a house built by a man who has never owned a square. Give me your hand.\u201d\n\nLiora gave her hand because it would have been foolish not to and because she trusted her. The witcher put something on Liora\u2019s palm that looked like a button and felt like a fingertip pressed to her skin. It had warmth and a pulse, and when she closed her hand around it, it melted with a sordid intimacy that would have embarrassed her if it had not been a charm. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of the old song as it was badly sung by a man very much in love,\u201d the witcher said. \u201cIt will remind you in a moment you cannot remember. Don\u2019t be precious about it. It is made of mistakes. Those are the best bits of anything.\u201d She looked at the willow and then at Liora and then at Elyse and Tern and Corin and Kite and Bramble, and she made that little bend of her head that made you feel like a person and not a child, and then she went on toward the place where all the people stand when they are asked to prove that they meant to mean well.\n\nThey set their feet. You cannot really say more than that about what anyone did after that, because there are hours in a story when everything becomes either one motion or a thousand, and in either case you will only insult it if you narrate. The white shelf held because it had been asked and praised and scolded all at once and did not know how to disobey all three at once. The bell-woman lost her voice and her daughters took her bell and rang not quite on the beat, which is best for waking the entranced because perfection reinforces dreams. The rope stopped being a soprano and became a baritone, and every man who had thought himself immune to the charm of music remembered his mother\u2019s hand on the back of his head, and how her ring had dug in if he tried to duck. The tuner laughed exactly once and then felt shy about it and made its note fatter, which is something fat notes sometimes do before they decide to roll over everything. Vesper\u2019s eyes shone with the happiness of someone whose experiment has proceeded like a parade, and then her eyes went sober because she too had learned something and it wasn\u2019t the thing she had meant to.\n\nAt two, the ground did a peculiar thing and carried everything two inches to the left and then put it back very gently as if to insult no one. A woman dropped a pot and it broke in two pieces so neat Corin put them back together and the seam kissed itself like an old scandal. A boy looked up and said in the voice of those who will grow up to write down lies that will save lives, \u201cI think it is trying not to hurt us,\u201d and his father said nothing because he had seen cows run in one direction when lightning strikes and the look in their eyes had not been kindness but haste. At two, Liora felt the taste of metal in the back of her mouth and bit the charm the witcher had given her and it tasted of a room with a table where a man had said sorry in a way that made apology a thing with weight and warmth, and she felt the stone under her feet approve that taste, because stone is not sentimental but it respects warmth.\n\nAt one, Vesper came and stood where the pigeons could see her. She had never cared for pigeons and did not begin now. She did not speak. She lifted both hands and then, because she was too honest with herself to be theatrical at the very instant when any gesture might be the one that would be made famous on napkins, she let them down again and put them on the blue stone as if to feel any last tremor before the place where counts become not-counts and numbers go to wherever numbers go when dismissed. Elyse took Liora\u2019s wrist and Liora took hers and Corin put his hand over both like it was a block he had set. Tern set his oar. Kite set his boat with an intimacy that made it one more thing that would be offended if it failed. Bramble stood up with his paws planted too wide because he had never enjoyed the concept of balance and had only ever excelled at presence.\n\nThe count shed its last mark like a snake sliding out of its skin. The tin cooled to nothing and then warmed, which is a trick metals have when they intend to lie to you. A wind rose not from the ground or the sky but sideways, as if a door had opened in a wall no one had thought was a door, and it smelled of rain on dirt that had not known rain for a while, and also of old oil on old hinges, and also of the inside of a sleeve where a woman had kept a letter for a day and then burned it because she had decided she liked being right more than she liked being happy. The column did not blaze; it inhaled. Everyone felt themselves be taken into a breath that was not theirs and then set back down as if the world had done a trial lift and found them heavier than they looked. The tuner sang a note no throat can hold and the rope laid itself against its posts like a hound forbidden to jump. Somewhere a child laughed, because children will laugh at weddings and funerals, which is what we have to forgive them and love them for, and Vesper closed her eyes as if to keep something from spilling out of her. Liora did not close hers. There is a sort of seeing that is only possible in ugliness, and she meant to do it.\n\nThe end, which had been rehearsing, did not occur. This is the mercy of the world. The end did not occur, but a different thing did. The Spire did not unmake the knot; it let it slip. It did not untie anything; it let it loosen. The mountains around them did not kneel; they shifted and put their weight differently on their feet. The river did not turn and run at the sky; it found a new path down and took it laughing in the dour way of rivers that have been reminded they prefer jokes to pronouncements. The green did not become black; it became a color that had never been named because there had never been a reason. It was like the inside of a leaf held to a lamp. It was like copper washed too thin. It was like old glass at the bottom of an old sea. People began to breathe wrong and then right again because that is what you do when something enormous spares you.\n\nVesper opened her eyes and looked at Liora and the look said three whole books in a sentence. Liora looked back and said four in five words without speaking any of them. The bell-woman sat down because she had rung too much and her daughters stood over her, one with a hand on her hair and one with a hand on her heart. Corin put his forehead to the stone and did not apologize because he had done his part better than that. Elyse exhaled the way women do when they have had to hold too many breaths while men finished being clever. Tern kissed the tin disc because it was the nearest piece of luck and then spit on it to take away any curse of pride. Kite put his boat on his head again because it had worked once and might again if the gods were of a practical sort, and surely some of them were. Bramble sneezed and looked startled and then pleased, which is one of the most complete reports anyone gives on any event.\n\nThe mountain, which had prepared, prepared again, because preparing is the way old things move toward change without giving away the dignity of their slowness. In the silence that came after the not-ending, Liora heard the lake. It is foolish to claim that; she knew it as she thought it. But the drum under the water that had been beating all week beat once now, here, under stone and under light, and she knew what she had always half known and refused to say because it would have meant she must act. The rooms were not rooms. The column was not a column. The count was not a count. They were arrangements. They were a choreographed remembering. Someone had taught Alderra to be a planet by singing it a song and then never sung the rest. Vesper had given it a chorus and it had hummed along as any good student will when put before a tune. It was not an ending. It was a modulation. Vesper\u2019s face, in that moment, held grief for every ending she had promised herself to love and the small surprise of relief that she might not be headmistress at the death of the world after all.\n\nIt is a great inconvenience when the apocalypse refuses to keep to schedule. Men must put their shovels down and pick them up again, and women must take off the kettle and put it back on, and everyone must learn a new way to be large or be small depending. The Spire had not undone; it had shifted the music, and in the new key many old songs could be sung and some could not and someone would have to write the ones that should. Liora sat with her back to the rock, the willow humming like a contented cat, and she thought with an irritation that tasted like gratitude that there would be time, now, for all the wrong arguments and some of the right ones. Vesper seemed to feel the same and disliked it and welcomed it and looked at Liora as if to say, Now we will find out whether you prefer governance to theater.\n\nNight came honest and with a few stars that had not been present lately. They looked washed, like children\u2019s faces after the first crying. People ate what they had and then what their neighbors had and then scolded each other for not having saved. Liora wrote on a scrap and put it into a reed and pressed it into a little runnel that had more confidence today than yesterday and said, \u201cTake it home. Do not show it to the fishmonger. He will say heroish isn\u2019t a word in front of my mother and I will have to be dignified and I do not prefer it.\u201d She told Tamsin the count had gone into a new shape and that she would not come down at once because a woman who has stood for an ending is required to stand for the not-ending too or else it looks like her courage belonged to someone else. She signed it in the way she had always signed such things for her mother: with a small drawing of Bramble\u2019s ear, which was the only thing she had ever been able to draw with any confidence.\n\nVesper came at last, late when late had become simply a number. She sat\u2014not on the stone, which she distrusted now because it had surprised her, but on the edge of Liora\u2019s circle of ordinary. There was dirt on her cheek again and a thread caught between two fingers because she had learned to embroider something in a spare hour once and had taken her skill with her into this foolishness. \u201cYour no,\u201d she said without preamble because manner is an affectation and not a virtue, \u201cdid not stop me. It did not even slow me. It shaped me. I dislike you for that and am grateful. Do you mean to stay long enough to make a nuisance of yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean to stay long enough to send children to bed when they should be sleeping, and to tell you when your men set a ladder of light where a ladder of wood is required, and to clap when your rooms open without killing anyone,\u201d Liora said, calm despite the way her knees ached and the way her mind wanted to gallop. \u201cI mean to talk to the lake when the mountain grows bored of me and to ask the old bee-woman for honey that remembers. I mean to be uninteresting whenever your work will try to turn me into an anecdote. I mean to watch you not end us, Vesper. I mean to watch you fail to be a hinge and succeed at being an instrument and at the end of it all I will go home and explain to my mother why I invented a new word and tell her she was right about every other thing and that will be hard and that will be good.\u201d She smiled, and this time the smile was not a weapon or a shield. It was a reasonable human happiness at having shouted at weather and not been drowned.\n\nVesper looked at the willow and at Bramble, who was asleep on his back with his paws curled like the hands of a man blessed by a priest he did not believe in, and at Elyse and Corin and Tern and Kite, who were each pretending to be asleep in the exhaustive way of tired people who will not admit it lest they be asked to get up. She lifted a hand and then put it down and made no grand gesture. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cStand opposite. I will tell my people you are to be indulged when you scold. They will dislike you and then stop. We will make something in the shape of our argument. It will not be pretty. It may be right.\u201d She stood and went away into the green that had become a lesser thing, and if she wished that the count had been romantic and catastrophic she did not show it, and if she had never meant the end in the first place, only the music, Liora would not inquire. There would be time for dignity and for insults later. For now, there was a dog to cover with a corner of blanket because he had the constitution of a duke and slept cold, and there was a braid to hang where it would catch, and there were seeds to water with three drops and no more because three is a number seeds like.\n\nFar away, where the reeds whisper when there is news, the lake breathed a light into the black that is the color of all lakes at night. It put its head on its own shore and listened. The heartbeat came slow and sure, not the climbing drum of a countermarch but the deliberate pace of a planet teaching itself, perhaps finally, to keep time to its own idea. In the house with the ledgers, a woman with clever hands and a temper like sober music read a rolled scrap delivered in a trout\u2019s mouth and did not smile until she counted spoon, people, and cows and found them all there, and then she smiled in a way that organized the room and made the lamps steadier. In the market with its twine-tied boys, a child told another that he had seen the lake stand up and sit and this time the other believed him because some lies are only true a week later. The reeds knocked their hollow bones and were almost content to be merely reeds rather than a choir for a princess who had gone north. The night wrapped itself around the mountain with the care that old shawls provide to old shoulders. Somewhere a hawk complained about tardiness and turned into itself, and Liora slept as well as anyone does amid the invention of a new kind of day.Morning pretended it had always meant to be quiet here, and the mountain indulged it with the sort of courtesy old things extend to young moods. Men woke with backs that had learned new verbs and decided not to complain until after bread. Women shook blankets and found the green had left dust on the wool as if it had been obliged to sign its name. The camp had acquired habits overnight; ropes that had sung set their throats and only cleared them when the wind forgot its place, and the bell-woman\u2019s daughters rang on the half-breath, which turned out to be the right time for bringing people back from the edge without making them feel laughed at. The white shelf, sulky but resigned, accepted pigeons, painted and otherwise, and a boy wrote his initials in the dust and then wiped them away because some vanity deserves to be brief. Liora woke feeling as if the inside of her bones had been scrubbed with snow, which is a respectable form of tiredness, and when she sat up the willow had left a pale line on her forearm like a note written by a friend who had not wanted to wake her.\n\nCommuniques arrived the way they do when a place has become a crossroads without permission. A trout reversed his arrogance long enough to allow a reed across his back, and Shade\u2019s hand was in the loop at the top\u2014broad, tidy script that made every letter stand like a soldier. He had tied a knot the river would remember and the knot had reached Liora\u2019s fingers without a scratch. Shade said he had heard the count pretend to be finished and fail, and that he approved of the mountain\u2019s refusal to indulge theater, and that he was sending Kite\u2019s cousin not because he did not trust Kite but because there was a woman on the south bank who had begun to sell ladles with the green set into the handles and it made him feel misunderstood in a way that needed hitting with oars. He added, almost as an afterthought, that Tamsin had sent a line but he was not opening it because he liked his ears where they were and would prefer to keep them. Liora laughed aloud and then did not, because her throat had not yet forgiven last night\u2019s alarms.\n\nTamsin\u2019s letter came in a reed that had been polished by thumb and patience until it thought itself a flute. The paper inside had the smell of the ledger room\u2014ink and lemon and an argument about whether candles should be allowed within arm\u2019s reach of a window. Liora sat with Elyse and Corin and Tern and Kite with their shoulders set like a bench, and she read in a voice that had not yet re-learned frivolity. Tamsin wrote that she would accept any outcome that did not involve losing her daughter or the lake\u2019s temper, and that she preferred the sort of bravery that sets tables and makes sure someone has tied the goats, and that if Vesper tried to set the count to her name then Liora was to say aloud the phrase you are quite boring at your worst and then remain silent for two full breaths, because silence is the one thing people who admire themselves cannot resist filling. She wrote, in smaller script that tightened like a knot, that she loved Liora in a way that had ruined her for comfort and that she thought the new word heroish might be forgiven if used only to describe dogs at dinners.\n\nThey learned the life of modules and alterations the way you learn a friend\u2019s domestic habits without intending to. After the green softened, the ropes took to humming when anyone tried to put a lie through them; a man told his companion he would be back by sundown even though he had no intention of being less than three days and the rope above his head made a noise like a tired aunt. Night-Tears budded and held their mouths shut with decorum until the first liar came to sit on Liora\u2019s stone and boast. He wore the green like a scarf and had the satisfied slump of men who have tried to die elegantly and been thwarted; he said he had gone up for children, and two buds rang so purely that even the pigeons put their heads under their wings in embarrassment. The man went red to his collar and then, to his credit, said, \u201cAll right. I went up because I have never been tall enough in any room and I wished to be taller,\" and one of the buds let out a small chiming that was not approval so much as a mitigation. Elyse looked at the little bells with the fond grimness of a woman who keeps a drawer of labels for jars and does not usually need them; she pressed a fingertip to one bud and it settled as if it had been patted.\n\nVesper sent a messenger with hair cropped too short to tie back and a mouth that had been taught to keep statements where they belong. The message said, politely, that another room would be opened by noon, and that those who had opinions about rooms were welcome to hold them close and then come and lay them out in an orderly fashion afterward. The new room, she had written with that airy cruelty Liora could not help admiring, was called the Archive of Weathered Names, which had once been a library and then been a cupboard and then a rumor and had lately been a wall. \u201cIt will allow,\u201d the messenger read without inflection, \u201cadjustments to the burden of seasons on places that have been badly served by habit. We will try it on the Fell-Flats by dusk. Bring your objections and your bells.\u201d The messenger held the last line in the air just long enough to be scolded by her own ears and then went away before anyone could decide to object at her personally.\n\nCorin, who had found in Vesper\u2019s people a tribe with whom to argue about weight and shame, went to look at the gutters cut for the Archive with that look of his that makes stone confide. He came back carrying dust on his shoulders like a new coat and told Liora that the room was more cupboard than library, and that it did not love names so much as it loved cataloguing what is left after names have been worn thin. \u201cIt will be useful until it remembers being hurt,\u201d he said, and made tea with the seriousness he reserved for nails set in the wrong grain. Elyse sat on her heels and shaved down the braid Shade had sent until its pride was less obvious to the eye, and while she worked she told a story about the last time a woman tried to adjust seasons with her hands and forgot she would have to hold the new ones steady when they arrived. \u201cPeople like beginnings,\u201d she said, tugging a knot into obedience. \u201cNobody likes standing in the doorway three years later and shooing out the drafts.\u201d\n\nThe witcher came with her bees at midmorning and set a jar on their stone with the solemnity of treaties. The honey inside had become the precise color of the green when it lay down into the valley and pretended it had not been elsewhere; when you tilted the jar, light moved through it like a fish remembering its river. \u201cFor when you need to tell the truth and want it to keep its hair combed,\u201d she said, and then, because she was unkind in exactly the right way, she looked over Liora\u2019s shoulder at the Archive and added, \u201cAnd for when Vesper tries to prettify a thing and forgets to admit she has, which is not the same as lying but is hungry for the same food.\u201d She drew a line with her boot on the ground and bees followed and went into the line one at a time, humming in numbers that pinned the ears. \u201cYou will appear in their story,\u201d she told Liora without any comfort in it. \u201cBe someone they must speak carefully about or they will say ridiculous things just to hear themselves.\u201d\n\nShade himself arrived before noon with reeds in his hair because he had promised and because he liked to keep to the letter when the spirit tried to get clever with him. He had one hand on the shoulder of a woman who had been a river-knight longer than any of the boys had been alive, and in the other hand a bundle of oars so clean you could have used them to teach a child the shape of a straight line. He greeted Kite with mockery that made a home of his mouth and then embraced Tern like a man who is thankful in quantities small enough to be spoken but large enough to be seen. \u201cI hear heroes,\u201d he said to Liora so quietly it was nearly a courtesy, \u201cand I prefer bread. If I am required to lift anything that is not a boat I will protest. I have brought with me four men who will not listen to women unless you put a fish in your hair, which is a failing of their childhood, not their souls, and three women who cannot stand Vesper in person and adore her at a distance, which makes them very useful in a crisis. Where would you like me to lay the oars so that they will be in the way of anyone who comes running cleverly.\u201d\n\nLiora pointed him toward the path that had acquired a habit of becoming a ribbon when no one watched it, and he arranged the oars across it with the artistry of a patient man making mischief. Tamsin would have liked him, Liora thought; they were of a species that had learned to prefer the friction of decency to the smoothness of adoration. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d the hawk announced from a post where no hawk had perched while anyone was looking, and then, seeing that nobody would be impressed by its tardy wit, turned itself into a puff of memory and left Corin coated in a fine layer of inconvenience. \u201cI dislike that bird,\u201d Elyse said, sneezing delicately and pinning her braid to the rock, and Shade grinned as if the hawk had been sent precisely to test whether they were taking themselves too seriously.\n\nThe Archive did not open so much as consent to have its lids removed. It smelled like rain and laundry and old paper that has tired of telling its story. Inside, names lay in drawers like folded shirts that had not been worn since the family got rich and then poor again. Vesper\u2019s people moved among the cabinets with the attentiveness of pickpockets and the ethics of librarians; they pulled out trays and did not sniff and did not propose improvements, and this restraint made Liora inclined to like them in ways that irritated her. Vesper stood with her hands behind her because she could not be trusted with them around an unclaimed instrument. She turned enough toward Liora that Liora felt included and not enough that she felt claimed, and Liora appreciated the courtesy as one appreciates a door held open on a day when you intend to argue past it.\n\n\u201cWe will try the Fell-Flats,\u201d Vesper said, tone uninflected and therefore dangerous. \u201cThree hamlets sit in the wind\u2019s lashed lip, and this year their grain will try to set in cold and fail. We will edge the seasons and see if the grain will accept a different invitation.\u201d She looked at Corin, because he had spoken against her seam the day before and she had learned the value in being warned by the man who disapproved. \u201cIf we are wrong, we will be wrong in a way we can stop. If we are right, I will take down a mountain of medals I have been granted in the last month by men who think we are in a war and have mistaken engineering for victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that within earshot of medals,\u201d Elyse said, sliding the braid into a place that would prevent anyone from becoming pleased with themselves and therefore injured. \u201cThey tarnish on purpose when they feel unappreciated.\u201d Vesper\u2019s mouth did the not-smile again, small and unguarded enough that Liora had to look away to keep from liking it.\n\nThey did not go to the Fell-Flats. It was, Liora argued, one thing to move the burden of a season on a page and another to move it on a woman standing in a field with cramp in both hands. \u201cIf you\u2019ve a trick to play,\u201d she said, with that careful politeness Tamsin had advised in her letter, \u201cplay it on a place that remembers it was empty. If the Archive is honest, it can edge frost on stone. Then we can count to three. We can make soup. We can do it once more with courage.\u201d Vesper considered the alternative with visible impatience and then, because she had somewhere learned the difference between concession and insult, she nodded and flicked her eyes toward the masons. \u201cFind me a corner that will not break anyone\u2019s heart if it goes wrong,\u201d she said, and three men ran as if she had said their names in the tone of payment.\n\nThe corner turned out to be a shelf of basalt that had, in some other life, been a river bed and now was a memory of water and a home to small stubborn plants. The Archive hummed at it as if reminding a child how to sit. A woman ran her hands along a drawer labeled Frost\u2013Unmarried and drew out a ribbon of something white that was not cloth and not light; when she put it to the stone, the stone pretended to be morning in a month it had not meant to see. For a moment it was too much like theater and Liora felt her temper climb as if it had been invited to perform; then the stone sighed in that way of old things finding a position they can maintain without resentment, and the frost settled into a filigree that looked like the veining on certain sweet loaves. Corin crouched, put his knuckle to it, and came up with a touch of ice that did not bite but did not flatter either. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve done it, you can do it again,\u201d he said, half warning and half benediction. \u201cThat is the problem and the gift.\u201d\n\nThey all felt it when the Archive looked at the Fell-Flats as a child looks at the cakes laid out of reach on a high shelf. It wanted to show off. Vesper\u2019s jaw moved, the small muscle that lives along the ear speaking to the parts of the body that do not listen otherwise, and she did not permit it. Liora did not applaud because withholding applause is sometimes the only respect worth offering. She allowed herself the mean little glee of observing Vesper behave like a governor rather than a virtuoso, and hated the glee because it did no one any good.\n\nDisappointment, like mildew, has to be looked for or it finds you first. In the camp at the far edge where the banners loved color more than they loved anything with bones, a group had taken to calling themselves the Lusters, because there are always people ready to make a club out of their weather. They had been saving their stares for the count\u2019s last breath and had been cheated of a tidy apocalypse, and now they were inclined to push the new work until something broke with a satisfying sound. Elyse came back from fetching water with her braids disordered and her expression cleaner than usual by virtue of irritation. \u201cThey are clever in the old way,\u201d she reported, a verdict she did not hand out lightly. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a girl who can make light sulk and they\u2019ve told her everyone will be grateful when she finally makes an honest mess. If we don\u2019t keep an eye on them they\u2019ll break the tuner and then write poems about it.\u201d\n\nKite went to sit in their path with his boat on his lap and the air of a man who would be delighted to be told to move and equally delighted to refuse. Shade took up a position near the rope because men who like to untie knots can be relied upon to recognize people tying them for sport. Tern found the bell-woman\u2019s smaller bell and stood with it like a man who could ring if told without having to be asked twice. Liora went the other way because Tamsin had written in smaller script, do not stand always where you are needed or they will mistake you for furniture. She went to the place where the Night-Tears had put up their second leaves and she whispered to them about patience and then laughed at herself for the kind of person who whispers to bells in seed-form.\n\nIt was Corin who found the writing under the Spire. He cared for vents and seams the way some men care for the backs of children\u2019s knees, and when Vesper\u2019s people needed someone to go into a slot cut by the old ones with very little regard for human ribs, he was the one who would fit and whose pride would not take offense. He came back hours later with dust in his hair and his wrist scratched where a tool had forgotten its manners, and a look in his eye that Liora had last seen when he had found an old line of mortared stone where a garden shed had claimed to be the eldest thing on a property. \u201cThey left jokes,\u201d he said, dazed and delighted. \u201cScratched in where no one could see them unless they were being insulted by the fit of the place. This one\u201d\u2014and he drew with his finger in the air\u2014\u201cis a little note that says do not stand under this unless you are better than a god at guessing. This one says my sister married an idea and they never had children. This one is a sketch of a pigeon relieving itself on the head of a man wearing a crown and the crown is shaped exactly like this.\u201d He pointed to the lip of the column where it forgot itself and Liora felt the human of the old builders reach up like a weed and take her by the ankle and insist that she remember all grand rooms are built by people who made faces while they worked.\n\nBy afternoon the Lusters had tried to make a spectacle and had been given soup instead. Kite had told them a story about the time he and Shade had rowed a mile backwards by mistake because the river had been insulted and then had to pretend they had intended it, and somehow in the telling the urge to break the tuner curdled into a cranky desire to be admired for not breaking it. Elyse passed around a batch of curses she had written in a neat hand and told them they could keep them for domestic use if they promised to insult only tea, not systems. Tern rang the little bell when any sentence grew so elegant it forgot about sense. Liora wrote a line in the dust that said we will not lift what we cannot set down without apology and left it there until someone\u2019s foot removed it because feet are the honest grooms of pride.\n\nVesper came to Liora not because she wanted to but because leaders speak to the person who has arranged to be an obstacle without being rude. She sat this time as she had before, on the outer rim of Liora\u2019s circle of ordinary, and her eyes did that glitter that belongs to people who have overachieved in their disdain for themselves and are trying to decide whether a compliment might help. \u201cI wanted it,\u201d she said without preface, because the day had knocked pleasantry out of her mouth. \u201cI wanted a clean end, a good story, a beautiful last note, and I have been given this instead, which is work, and scheduling, and the particular fatigue of knowing the better thing will be to get up tomorrow and get up again after that. You can make fun of me now if you like. I deserve it, though I warn you I may enjoy it.\u201d\n\nLiora considered the delights of unkindness and let most of them go because she was, alas, improving with practice. \u201cI will save it for an hour when I am tired and you are arrogant,\u201d she said, which earned her a proper smile and the raising of a shoulder that suggested Vesper had wanted to be forgiven and was angry to find that forgiveness had no glamour. \u201cTell me why you hate doves,\u201d she added, because small questions won where all the large ones make enemies, and Vesper blinked and then, absurdly, told her.\n\nHer father had bred them as a hobby, it seemed, and had given them all names that could be whistled and then had forgotten them and whistled names at random. Half the birds had starved because they were waiting to be called to supper by a song their throats did not recognize, and Vesper had taken that into her bones as one takes into one\u2019s throat a slice of an orange eaten at the exact wrong hour. \u201cI dislike creatures that require a performance to eat,\u201d she said, harsh and precise with the old grievance, and Liora recognized the ragged place where a childhood sometimes puts its teeth and felt distaste at her own complicity in admiring Vesper\u2019s wound. \u201cI will not be a dove,\u201d Vesper said, low, and then the mountain gave a little shrug like a man settling his jacket and the Archive rustled its drawers as if to say there are worse things to be than named and fed.\n\nThe hawk, having failed to properly land on Corin\u2019s head earlier, found a new way to insist on its presence: it spoke from the side of a rock where any other bird would have chosen to be quiet. \u201cYou will be late to everything you love if you make yourself stay here,\u201d it told Liora with the shamelessness of a creature that has never kept a ledger. \u201cYou will be early to your own death if you go everywhere anyone asks you to go. Choose the rudeness you prefer.\u201d Elyse threw her a look that said do not dignify a hawk, and Liora laughed because the advice was useful and because she was becoming more and more the sort of person who used laughter to keep from setting anything on fire.\n\nLate, at the hour when even children who are fascinated by the idea of standing awake under a painted pigeon become heavy as bread in arms, the rope\u2019s song changed and then corrected itself, and six people looked up at once with the same expression: the old one, the witcher, two masons, Liora, and Vesper. It was not an alarm; it was an inclusion. The rope had learned a second part to the tuner\u2019s line and was suggesting a harmony. Vesper looked almost frightened, which is an interesting expression on a face that prefers to be the person frightening others. \u201cIt will do this now,\u201d she said, quietly to herself and not quietly enough that Liora did not hear. \u201cThe work will go on where it is not pointed. The rooms will learn to talk to one another when I am not in the room. How unbearable, to have made something willing to proceed without my applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow bearable,\u201d Liora said, thinking of Tamsin in her room with soft lamps and the meticulous comfort of put-away spoons, and thinking of men with oars who measured the world by their arms and did not try to tell the river what it was, and thinking of Bramble, who had at last found the exact place between Elyse and Corin where his heat kept both their ankles warm and had fallen into sleep as sincere as any vow. \u201cTo know you are no longer the hinge. To be something useful like a shelf instead.\u201d Vesper made a terrible face and then agreed with the part of herself that had learned, at last, that the better insult is the one you keep.\n\nThat night the Night-Tears opened their mouths and did not ring because they had learned taste in their hours closed. They showed their pale throats to the green\u2014no longer the insistence of a plan but the lament of a habit\u2014and then filled with dew and held it like pearls. Liora touched one with the back of her finger and thought of Tamsin\u2019s letter and wrote one back, not with reed and trout but with the ordinary vigor of a pen on paper and the knowledge that rivers would not mind being denied a small errand. She said that she had stood at the place where endings are supposed to occur and had been offered instead the very long work of mending a world that had been taught to think it could be better after it broke, and that she had said yes to the mending because there are only two kinds of people in such stories and she had decided to be the kind named afterward for braids or for sensible shoes rather than for plummets or for glory. She wrote that she would come home as long as she could, as often as she could, as soon as she felt she had left a mark anyone could find their way by in her absence, and that she had invented another word and it was not heroish; it was worksome. She thought her mother might forgive this.\n\nIn the hours before dawn, when the mountain tells itself the fables it keeps for grandchildren, something padded past their circle that made Bramble sit up without barking. He lifted his head, sniffed, considered whether to make a fuss, and then, decisively, thumped his tail twice. Liora knew better than to ask him to translate; he had been bred for presence, not for exegesis. In the gray that followed, a woman came into view with a stick in her hand and a baby strapped to her chest and half a loaf under her arm. She had the soft-ankled stride of those who do not know they are being watched by history. \u201cWe came up for the end,\u201d she said to no one as if apologizing to a fence. \u201cWe will stay for the middle. Does anyone need a stitch put in a sleeve.\u201d She sat without being asked and threaded her needle with floss that had been dyed with onion skins, and Liora found herself stupidly grateful in the way you are when a world has not ended and someone offers to fix shirt cuffs.\n\nWhen the sun decided to report for duty, the Fell-Flats sent a message by smoke. It did not say gratitude; it said we had frost and did not, and the second part of the sentence had been written by a twelve-year-old with a reckless love for grammar. Vesper saw it and did not pretend indifference, and she did not betray herself by speaking more than the room required. Liora saw her take the news into that place where she carried the story of the doves and the underfed; she saw her rearrange her contempt into usefulness. She stood and stretched and glanced toward the blue room with all the old hunger in her face and then glanced toward the white shelf with a new attention that would not let the sugar-likers stand without a bell. \u201cCome be my argument,\u201d she said to Liora, dry as a piece of toast that would still be the best thing you ate all day. \u201cWe will open another room. We will close two. We will tell the rope it is not a choir unless it receives a medal from the bell-woman. We will make a policy about pigeons. We will write it down. We will be contemptibly alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorksome,\u201d Liora agreed, because she had found a word and meant to make it pull. She stood into the day with the willow singing a little because it had learned, like the rest of them, that there was more to be done than singing, and that songs might have to be used like tools and tools like prayers and prayers like bells rung not for endings but to get people to come and eat. The hawk\u2019s shadow went by without comment. The rope held its line. The Archive adjusted its drawers hopefully and was told plainly to wait its turn. Bramble trotted ahead to ask the path what sort of foolishness it planned before breakfast, and the path, out of affection, tried to behave. They started for the door with the light planks and did not step on the places that liked to be looked at more than walked upon, and behind them the Night-Tears held their dew and decided to ring later for something that would need ringing more than any of this.",

                              "content": "The reeds at Woodlake whisper when there is news. They knock their hollow bones against one another and make a music like chilled bells, or like nervous teeth, and the sound carries over water black as a sleeping mirror. Dragonflies rocked on the air, lantern-bright, and the first pale fogs of evening came unshouldered out of the water and the alder trees. Somewhere, deep beneath the surface, something boomed \u2014 not loudly, not at all like thunder; more a steady drumbeat in the bones, a reminder, a hello. It had been happening all week and nobody agreed what it meant. Perhaps the lake settling. Perhaps an old, fat catfish, thumping the silt with its tail. Or perhaps \u2014 the old women said, in the back galleries of the market \u2014 perhaps Woodlake itself had taken up a heartbeat to warn its princess.\n\nLiora liked to walk when it began. Alone was not quite the word, because Bramble would not entertain it. He trotted beside her, ears up, tail feathering brief spells in the air, each step of his small paws loud with importance. He was a mutt who looked like the leftover dream after a braid had been unplaited \u2014 half grey like morning ash, half brown, with a nose that was always damp and always looking for secrets. His eyes were ridiculous. Not because they were large, though they were, but because they wore all their feeling on their glossy sleeves. It\u2019s uncommon for princes to allow such honesty, and princesses risk it only if they are very brave or very foolish; Liora was sometimes both.\n\nWhen the boom came tonight, Bramble stopped so suddenly he slid among oak leaves and flailed, and then he lifted one paw and pressed it against her boot as if to say, Could we maybe not. She bent and pressed her forehead to his, and he sneezed and looked aggrieved.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a drum far away,\u201d Liora said to him. \u201cOr else it\u2019s like when you lie with your ear against the earth, and you\u2019re trying to hear someone crossing the heather. It\u2019s something under all this.\u201d\n\nBramble made a sound. The sound said this: I am a good dog. I am your dog. I will follow you under lakes and into fires. But perhaps first supper.\n\n\u201cYou eat like a raven,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve had three suppers.\u201d\n\nShe wore no circlet tonight, no gem-knotted cloak. If anyone had seen her in the wilder reeds and asked they would have thought her a woodcutter\u2019s daughter with wandering thoughts and mud on her hem. She had the look of her mother in the eyes \u2014 green as green can be without looking witch-lit \u2014 and her father\u2019s mouth, a little severe when she was thinking hard. She carried a willow-twist staff because the kings and queens of Woodlake had always carried such, partly for ceremony and partly because the willow leaned and listened and had opinions about the way magic moved. It swore it could hear the sky sometimes. It hissed when she dipped the end into dark water. Hush, hush, hush.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting louder,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother boom, a slow pulse. Her heart tried to match it; it made her chest feel asymmetrical. She touched the staff to the surface and for an instant it wasn\u2019t a mirror anymore. She saw blue stone and two figures in a long room with a ceiling of glass \u2014 or not glass, a substance so polished it had forgotten how to be touched \u2014 and behind those figures a column of light that wasn\u2019t light, and the feeling of falling and falling. She gasped and drew back. The water returned to the lake\u2019s ordinary interiors: weed, silt, those tiny curling creatures that looked like punctuation marks.\n\nBramble sneezed again, harder, and then he trotted forward and pressed his paws onto the wet wooden deck and peered into the lake as if he might find the very thing, and if he could catch it maybe he would shake it until it let go of their world. His reflection distorted. He growled at himself, then pranced and forgot why.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Liora said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost bell-five. If I don\u2019t sit to supper and smile and tell three stories to the minor houses, I will hear about it from now until the thaw.\u201d\n\nShe went up the path without watching for where she placed her feet, trusting the path to be where it always was. And it was. The castle of Woodlake lifted in gentle habits above her, not a beast of stone so much as one that had grown. It was built of pale marble and dark timbers, and there were gardens that went in and out of its bones. The windows were tall and full of light until the day failed, and then they held on to the light and made it seem like their own. The walls had feathers of moss and the roofs drank the first snow. It was a place that had never been at war, not that anyone living could recall; Woodlake had sent boats loaded with grain, had sent woodworkers to shore up cities after quakes, had sent a princess with white flowers in her hair to marry a prince and stitch one wound shut. They had never kept an army ready. Perhaps that was an old omission at last ready to be corrected. Liora did not think of that as she climbed. She thought of the reverberating beat beneath the dock, and of how far off the warm smell of spiced lamb was.\n\nThree boys were racing at the gate. They stopped when the guards nodded and Liora lifted a hand and said, \u201cWho\u2019s winning?\u201d One boy with a tear on his cheek. One with a scab on his forehead. One with a piece of twine around his wrist, as if a string could keep him from falling away.\n\n\u201cMe,\u201d the three said together.\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019ll have to race again,\u201d Liora said gravely. \u201cWe can\u2019t have three winners. What would the drummer say? He\u2019d have to beat a very odd rhythm to march you home.\u201d\n\nThey blinked at her. The smallest said, \u201cPrincess, is the drum in the lake bad?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if you\u2019re a fish who loves silence.\u201d She pushed at the smallest boy\u2019s shoulder, hardly at all, and he laughed, relieved, and then they were off, feet slapping.\n\nIn the entry hall the new banners hung with the old. The new ones smelled faintly of dye and river-wet linen. The old ones smelled of dust and thyme and grandmothers. Liora touched one as she passed. The woodcutters\u2019 guild had adopted a stag rampant this year. Last year they\u2019d made-do with crossed saws. \u201cA promotion,\u201d she murmured.\n\n\u201cWho, my dear?\u201d Queen Tamsin looked up from where she sat on the bottom step of the stairs correcting a ledger even though she had a perfectly good steward to do it. Other queens use their hands to wave or to hold hands out for kissing. Tamsin used hers to count. Liora loved her more than she knew how to say and also found her sometimes like an irritating splinter she couldn\u2019t quite pull free.\n\n\u201cThe stag,\u201d Liora said. \u201cIt used to be saws. Now I suppose it\u2019s a more rugged identity. The lake is booming again.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat it is,\u201d Tamsin said, pursing her mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ve sent three boats out. Corin says there\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary going on under the teasel islands.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell Corin to bring the boats back before full dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think there\u2019s danger?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there are secrets. You know how Bramble gets when there are secrets.\u201d\n\nThey both looked down. Bramble had found the steward and was making a complex attempt to steal the man\u2019s pencil by appearing to be concerned about the state of his boots. The steward laughed significantly, and then he gave in and tickled Bramble behind one ear. Bramble\u2019s eyes rolled back. He made an incoherent sound, the sound of absolute surrender to the idea of being a dog.\n\nWhen supper began, the hall expanded to accommodate it. It always did. The rafters seemed taller. The air grew rich with steam and spice and the holler of everyone trying to talk low. Liora took her place and answered every question with patience and a soft voice. She asked more in return. This was something Tamsin had impressed upon her early: if you want people to trust you, you must be curious about them. It is easier to lie to someone who never asks, or to someone who hides inside their own head with a nice book and a dog. Much easier.\n\n\u201c\u2026and the early apples will be thin,\u201d said the boy with the twine around his wrist, now carefully man-shaped and placed with his father at the low table near the dais, the one for the small houses.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send trade to Fairmere,\u201d Liora said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had too much rain and their orchards will bend themselves down with what they can\u2019t press. We can put it into jars: spiced, boiled, dried. You know the ginger recipe? It\u2019ll turn your tongue into a river.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d his father said, bowing slightly, grateful and a bit embarrassed. \u201cThe drumming\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re watching.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s eyes skimmed the hall. She had the way of knowing when to look where \u2014 her version of magic, Liora sometimes thought, stronger than any spell. Now her gaze paused, and a moment later the door-hall opened of its own accord because a man, a messenger, had made up his mind that it would. He looked as if three roads had each tried to keep him. Dust at the cuffs and the mouth. Rain in his hair like needles. He wore the black coat of the Crown\u2019s roadmen \u2014 those who bore news that had to be heard even when it wished otherwise \u2014 and he was exhausted in the peculiar way of those who don\u2019t stop because stopping would be worse.\n\nHe did not kneel. He blinked when he saw Liora with her willow staff leaning at the table and Bramble under her chair; he blinked when he saw Tamsin on the stair. He took a breath that sounded like it hurt him and said, \u201cI come out of Vale. I came as far as Woodlake in two days. I am sorry for my face. I have a letter. I have something to tell. There is a princess in the North, and she says she is going to end us.\u201d\n\nThe hall steamed and went still. People exchanged glances the way fish exchange flashes of light. A princess, he had said, and not one of the old pricking pranks like put a frog in your boot. End us.\n\n\u201cCome closer,\u201d Tamsin said.\n\nBramble rose, hackles up. He was not often a dog for hackles. Liora put a hand down and felt him vibrate under her fingers and he calmed because he believed in her hand more than he feared whatever this was.\n\n\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Liora asked as he climbed the dais steps. He kept his eyes off the food and she loved him a little for that.\n\n\u201cSaeth,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll sit and eat when you\u2019ve told me.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, once. He put the letter into Tamsin\u2019s hand. It bore in cracked red wax the sunburst of the Upper Crown, but Tamsin didn\u2019t break it. She watched Saeth\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cShe calls herself Vesper,\u201d Saeth said. \u201cPrincess Vesper of the Black Spire, though the Spire belongs to no one. She went up three moons ago. She took two hundred and thirty-seven with her, and half were witchers and half were masons and the rest were\u2026 the rest were the sort of men who build roads through places where roads do not wish to be. And women. She took women too. She said she had a right to the Spire because her grandmother\u2019s grandmother had watched the sky fall open there once. She keeps saying things like that. She says a great many things. At first everyone laughed. It\u2019s not easy to take someone seriously when they bring bees into a meeting hall and light them like candles. But we stopped laughing when the auroras came. We stopped when the rivers ran backwards a while. We stopped when \u2014 forgive me the saying \u2014 when birds fell like apples. Then some came and told the Crown and the Crown told me to run faster.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat she wants,\u201d Tamsin said. She kept the letter whole, as if breaking it might break something else.\n\n\u201cShe says the planet is wrong. That Alderra was bent a little crooked and the crookedness is why the sky sometimes catches and tears, and why the mountains still strap themselves on each other when we sleep. She says to fix it would be to end it. She says to end it would be to begin it right. She says she would lay her head down in the ash along with us and sleep fine.\u201d\n\nLiora felt ill. She sat with her hands open on her knees, the way you would if you were going to stand suddenly and did not wish to knock the table askew. The willow staff, propped behind her, hummed so faintly she could have believed she imagined it. People say mad to mean dangerous. They say dangerous to mean mad. Neither are useful for understanding. She had been taught by a woman who kept bees and who did not light them. She had been taught to look.\n\n\u201cWhat does she have?\u201d Liora said. \u201cWhat does she hold in her hands that makes her able to do more than promise?\u201d\n\nSaeth swallowed. \u201cThey brought machines up. Old ones. Things that had been in the Black Spire since before by-Grandmother time. Ropes that sang when you pulled, and glass that changed when you looked at it, and ladders that turned to light when you stood on them. I did not go inside. I sat on the scree behind a pike of stone and watched. The night was a green shade like bruising. She stands there with her hands up and the stars flicker, and the air goes thin. She\u2026 Princess, forgive me, I know how it sounds, but the ground rose and bit itself. The Black Spire is not so black anymore. It\u2019s shining. And there\u2019s a humming, and the rivers\u2014\u201d He reached for the letter in Tamsin\u2019s hand as if it were a little boat that might steady him. \u201cWhen I came into the new road through the Ash Plain, I had to tie rocks to my boots to keep from taking two strides and then being thrown ten in the air as if by laughter. Everyone is frightened. Some are in love with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is she kin to?\u201d Tamsin said, and broke the seal after all. Her eyes moved. Her mouth made a tight line.\n\n\u201cSome say she\u2019s of the Vale line, but she doesn\u2019t claim them. She claims everything older. She says she is daughter to the first night. She speaks in that way that moves people. I could feel it under my tongue even across the stones. She says we have been sleeping in the wrong bed.\u201d\n\nBramble, who had crept up, put his chin on Liora\u2019s knee and shook once, as if he\u2019d just come out of cold water. She scratched his head and felt him begin to melt again. \u201cI know that way of speaking,\u201d she said. \u201cThey pull you toward an edge and then tell you you\u2019ve always lived there and your bones knew it before you did.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d Saeth said, startling. \u201cShe asked for you. For you by name. For Liora of Woodlake.\u201d\n\nThe air changed at the table. Not colder. Tighter. Bramble made a low sound, a bottle too much corked.\n\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe said: Tell Liora of Woodlake to put her ear to the water, and she will hear what I hear, and she will see that the planet wants an ending.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s hand came down on Liora\u2019s shoulder, warm. She squeezed. \u201cEat,\u201d she told Saeth, brisker than the moment deserved. That was her way of holding things together. \u201cThen sleep in the old winterroom. We\u2019ll decide in the morning what to send back.\u201d\n\nAfter, when everyone else had eaten their sighs and gone to their rooms, Liora stood in the Map Room with the maps in the dark. She did not light a flame. Sometimes you see more in the dark, because the dark is an honesty that doesn\u2019t like to be interrupted. The maps had been drawn over a hundred and thirty-four years by a woman with a particular manner of observation. Every tree that had mattered to that woman was caught in the neat wrist of her ink. Every river that had changed its mind. The Black Spire was there, a small thorn in the north, with a note in tight hand: Do not go.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Liora said to no one. To the ink, perhaps.\n\nHer own breath came out and made her a small cloud to stand in. She put her finger to the Spire and imagined it shining. She imagined Vesper with her hands up, calling out the names of the old things \u2014 whether the names were true or were just noise that could be coaxed into shape by the quality of her wanting. Liora did not want to speak with her. She wanted to return the lake to silence and to tell the children at the gate that if they cried for their mothers it would be only because they\u2019d both run too hard and had a stitch.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel that there\u2019s something in your head that is not you?\u201d Liora asked in the dark.\n\nThe room did not answer. The willow leaned against the wall.\n\nBramble exhaled his little snore, and the sound made the lack of answer less bothered. He turned on his back and presented the ceiling with his stomach, with all his vulnerability, because he had decided the ceiling wasn\u2019t interested in doing him harm. Liora knelt and put her hand to that warm small belly. She let herself rest like that until her thoughts had slowed.\n\nShe did not always dream; she was one of those frustrating people who sleep like a healthy river does: with clarity. But she dreamed that night. In the dream she was standing on the dock with the fog coming up in threads, and her staff was gone, and the lake took a breath beneath her feet and said her name. Not in words \u2014 in shape and in pull. She knelt and put her ear to the water and the surface tension held her. It felt like being a cup set out on a table when someone is stomping down the hall. The drumming was louder. It became a steady beat that belonged to a heart that was too slow for any body that size, except there are bodies larger than we are used to saying aloud. It spoke the way hearts speak: not in the language of promises, but in the language of forever. She thought: It wants to be different. She thought: Maybe it wants to hold a different sky.\n\nShe sat up in the dream and there was a woman beside her. The woman\u2019s hair had the color of limestone that has been underwater a thousand years. She was smiling as if she had never learned how not to. She was not beautiful. She was the kind of person you would look at twice because she didn\u2019t look like you expected an ending to look.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been putting your ear to it,\u201d the woman said. Her voice carried the North in it. There is a cadence you get when you speak with the wind rattling at your mouth. \u201cThat\u2019s good. The ears are the last to lie. Sometimes the eyes lie because the eyes are hungry. But the ears are like wheat. They listen and they lean.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Liora said, even though she knew.\n\n\u201cPrincess Vesper,\u201d the woman said, and dipped her head as if to be polite and to mock courtesy in exactly the same gesture. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to reach you. Sorry to come into your dark like this. It\u2019s too late to be careful. I suppose I could have sent a dove. I don\u2019t like doves.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been calling rivers backwards,\u201d Liora said. That wasn\u2019t what she had meant to say. The dream had made her mouth peculiar. \u201cYou\u2019ve been making birds fall.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome things fall because they\u2019re tired,\u201d Vesper said. \u201cSome because a different wind owns them. I\u2019m showing the planet its choices. It\u2019s been doing the same thing so long it hasn\u2019t the imagination.\u201d\n\n\u201cChoice,\u201d Liora said. \u201cYou mean disaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean correction,\u201d Vesper said, gentle as milk. \u201cYou know the stories. How many times the sky has wintered badly. How many times it cracked. How many times the mountains shook hands so hard it broke the houses between. We keep patching Alderra like a kettle. She\u2019s nowhere near the shape she began with. I think we might as well admit it. We could all sit close when it happens. We could hold children tight and not pretend to ourselves. After, perhaps we go somewhere better. Perhaps there is a rightness. Or perhaps there is nothing and we wear that nothing like velvet. It hardly seems worse than this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know despair when I hear it,\u201d Liora said. \u201cI also know a woman who loves a stage. Who loves the breath before the song when everyone is waiting for the next note to fall down their backs.\u201d\n\nVesper\u2019s smile twitched. \u201cYou think I like the theater of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brought bees into a meeting hall,\u201d Liora said. \u201cA little theatrical.\u201d\n\nVesper shrugged. She had the shape of someone who had never been told no enough to dislike it. Liora flinched with an old memory: being a small girl and watching another small girl smash a dragonfly between stones just to see if the light went out of it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight you,\u201d Vesper said. \u201cYou do not strike me as particularly gifted at it, and I hate being bored. Why not lay down your willow and climb the Spire? See what I see. If I am wrong, we will both come down and do what you like. If I am right, I will take your hand and we will pull the planet out of its old bed and lay it in a new one.\u201d\n\nThere were a dozen questions that a careful person would ask then. Liora asked none of them. She stood up in the dream. Her knees were stiff even though dream-knees don\u2019t have to be. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPrincess,\u201d Vesper said, and her head tilted a little, and for an instant the whole world seemed to sway toward her like trees that have just been rooted up. The power was in her throat and in the cadence, but it was also in her hips and her quiet feet. Everything about her declared a different gravity. \u201cDo not be foolish. You are brave, yes. You are good. Goodness is for farmhouses. We are standing in the place where large choices are made. Sometimes goodness must be set down. The people do not need you to be kind. They need you to be what the air is, and what the old stone is. You must be the hand that does not shake.\u201d\n\nLiora could not breathe for a moment. She knew with a child\u2019s clarity that if she listened to that music too long she would begin to clap along. So she thought of Bramble\u2019s snore, and of the way the steward laughed, and of the taste of the first apple slice of autumn, and of her mother\u2019s ledger written in that narrow unsentimental hand, and of the boys at the gate tying string to their wrists to keep from falling up. It steadied her. \u201cNo,\u201d she said again. \u201cYou are throwing rocks at a beehive because you like the sound, and you do not care if the honey is ruined.\u201d\n\nVesper\u2019s hand moved. The dock under Liora\u2019s feet tilted. The dream was no longer a dream; it became one of the other things. A presentiment or a test. Liora felt water come up and walk into her mouth. It filled her ears. It crowded her eyes. She opened them and Vesper was standing over her with something like tenderness. \u201cYou will come anyhow,\u201d Vesper said. \u201cYou will come and say no, and that will be good too. I prefer to have an opposer. We make meaning when we stand opposite. Without you I am only a girl on a rock pulling at the dark.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not your meaning,\u201d Liora said, but it was full of water, it was an ugly little bubble of remark, and Vesper laughed like someone who had owned laughter since she was born.\n\nLiora woke in the Map Room with her cheek stuck to the cold table. Bramble was standing on her stomach, which is not forgiving if you are a princess. His paws dug into her softest parts and his nose pushed her chin as if to say: up. up. Up now. He smelled worried, which is a little like hot bread and a little like wet. Outside, the lake boomed. Not a dream. She sat and scrubbed her face. The taste of salt and oak smoke sat at the back of her throat.\n\n\u201cI will go,\u201d she told Bramble. The word tasted like iron. \u201cNot to say yes. To say it where she can hear me. Not to let this planet be broken by a woman who enjoys her own voice too much. We\u2019ll leave after the market. Tell no one.\u201d\n\nBramble wagged once and then had to wag again because the first wag had not been enough. He ran in a small circle because his joy was too big to fit inside him. He brought his rope. Then he forgot the rope and barked at his rope as if it had been impudent.\n\nThe morning came up indifferent to their plans, perhaps on purpose. The sky had the color of a metal that has been in many mouths and has come out of all of them disagreeably. People were in the lanes early for Bloomtide \u2014 the year\u2019s first market where the city\u2019s winter-secret crafts come out and the winter-hidden people do too. Liora ate a piece of bread while walking and someone put a smear of honey on it at the last moment and she licked her thumb. The woodsmoke had a hopeful smell. Everything was precious and ordinary.\n\n\u201cPrincess, the herbman says his rosemary died again and he swears it\u2019s not his fault despite the new sign on his window that says BEWARE OWLS.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the owls are his scapegoats,\u201d Liora said. \u201cTell him to grow thyme for a change.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess, the western stair has a crack.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it grow?\u201d she asked. \u201cIs it a crack that has ambition? Or does it look back at you with sleepy eyes and say, enough, I am done.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess, the lake boomed during the candle-blessing. Do you think the candles are now gods.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the candles will still go out,\u201d she said, and smiled, and did not look aside toward the water because if she did she might not stop.\n\nAt Market, she bought nothing and everything. A boy put a living beetle made of glass into her palm and it ticked and then it slept. A woman pressed a ring on her finger and said for no money at all, take it, I cannot bear to have it in my house. The ring had a small flaw you could love if you looked and looked and looked. And she took a packet of seeds labeled Night-Tears and pretended she had not seen the little sketch in the margin of a plant blooming in the shape of a bell with its mouth shut. She took them because she wrote the names down and the names became her friends. Night-Tears. She wanted to know what they would do if you gave them rain.\n\nWhen the water rose in a shape that was not the shape that water takes, there were four hundred people milling near enough to see it and to remember it badly for the remainder of their lives. It rose not as a wave but as a long low wall that mimicked the shore. It smoothed itself with a gesture that was intimate and lazy. Children screamed because it seemed like fun and then screamed because it was not. The wall moved one half-pace onto the land and then stopped, perfectly matched to the curve of the dock. It held. It was as if a lake had decided it would rather be a different sort of lake for a moment.\n\nLiora dropped the small pack she had packed. She ran. She saw the willow in her hand and did not remember taking it but she must have; it had the familiar weight above her wrist. She raised it because some gestures are older than your reasons for making them.\n\nThe water spoke in the sound of all the water Liora had ever drunk. It said: Do you hear the drum now. It said: Here is your ear, pressed to me. It said: Why would we not try to be new. And then it stopped saying everything and lurched and threw itself back down so suddenly that all the boats, even those tied tight, crashed and banged and the dock\u2019s old ropes snapped and men reached for children and their feet slipped, and for a moment it was chaos, pure and messy.\n\nLiora stood with her staff out, and she did nothing and everything with it. She did not know the name for the gesture she made. It was something like hello and something like sit. The willow sang under her hands. It is possible to remind a thing what it is. Perhaps that is what she did. People stopped shouting. The water drew itself down. There were still splashes where there shouldn\u2019t be, little shining puddles cupped in handprints on the dock. Bramble barked at the puddles and tried to lick them back into the larger water. He sneezed and glared at his nose as if it were to blame.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re saying,\u201d someone said, breathless, \u201cthey\u2019re saying it\u2019s the Black Spire. They\u2019re saying Vesper.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop saying names and pull the old man up,\u201d Tamsin shouted, voice cutting the market clean. The guard captain hadn\u2019t needed to tell her; she had been moving before the water did. She came up beside Liora and did not ask what Liora had seen because she could read it all in her daughter\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Liora said, very quietly. \u201cMother. I\u2019m going and I want you to pretend you didn\u2019t hear me decide it now, and that I decided it after you told me no, and that I obeyed you all my life and it went fine and that this is not the first time I will disobey.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s mouth did that thing where it held words back by holding very still. She breathed in through her nose and out, and then she reached and pulled a twig out of Liora\u2019s hair because of course there was a twig in Liora\u2019s hair. She held the twig like it meant something. It did.\n\n\u201cYou will not go alone,\u201d Tamsin said. \u201cAnd you will not go today. You will take Corin, and Elyse, and two from the river knights if Shade can spare them. You will take food. You will write me letters even if the letters have to come in on trout. And you will not, not, speak an agreement to anything without letting me say the wrong thing about it first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am leaving now,\u201d Liora said. \u201cIf I leave later there will be a later after later and then someone will be dead whom I love and that will be the thing after which I cannot move. I have to go while I still have motion. I will take Bramble. I will take the willow. Corin will come if he is the sort who comes; I think he is. Elyse will not; she will be insulted you asked her. Shade will let the river knights go if you look at him as you do when you think he is being heroish. That\u2019s a real word. It should be. Look: I will come back in three days if I can\u2019t make a path.\u201d\n\nTamsin laughed because Larry at the fish stall shouted, \u201cHeroish isn\u2019t a word, Princess!\u201d He had good ears, that man. He wrapped a fish in paper and threw it to Bramble who caught it with a dismaying skill for someone who was supposed to be a companion and not a wild animal. Bramble trotted in a circle with the fish and his rope and nearly strangled himself because joy and food and ropes were too much for any one animal.\n\n\u201cThree days,\u201d Tamsin said. \u201cFour and I\u2019ll come after you with reeds in my hair like a madwomen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would know you by your hands anywhere,\u201d Liora said.\n\nTamsin put both those hands on Liora\u2019s cheeks and kissed her forehead and then she stepped back and spoke to the air in a very particular tone that meant she was speaking to the old wood and to the small gods in the mortar as much as to the people. \u201cYou will not fail to return our daughter,\u201d she said, as if the walls were responsible. The walls rustled, embarrassed but consenting.\n\nLiora slung the pack back on her shoulder. It had been packed two hours. Bramble circled once and put his little paws exactly where they had to go for them to be moving together three heartbeats later. They went not to the road that most took to the north \u2014 the road that went along the river and then up into the passes like a thread going through buttons \u2014 but to the older path, the one that went beneath the alder trees in a whispering half-tunnel and then into the old quarry lands where the ground held fossils of fish that had learned to pretend to be leaves. Liora liked that way. She preferred to walk where things had been pretending for a long time. It made you honest. Or maybe it only made you wary, which is another sort of honesty.\n\nThey did not look back at the castle because sometimes it is easier not to. They did not look back at the lake because the lake would be doing that performance where it pretended to be fine. The reeds made their soft teeth-chatter. The willow stick hummed, a thread that grew more taut the further north they went, though there was no reason it should. Bramble loped as if his paws were kissing each new piece of dirt as a personal favor.\n\nShe saw the omen at the edge of the quarry: a hawk sitting on a stone and not minding them at all. Hawks mind you. That is what they are for. This one looked like a thought that had turned to bone and feather because it was tired of being thought. It watched her with all its regard, and that, more than the lake\u2019s new tricks, made her feel hairline cracks in her certainty. She stopped and lifted her hand like she was about to speak to a person. \u201cHello,\u201d she said, stupidly.\n\nThe hawk spoke. It said, in a voice like shale, \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d and then turned into itself and became a puff of dust because sometimes that is what words do to a body. Bramble leapt and sneezed because he had tried to bite the air where a bird had been. Then he looked smug, as if he\u2019d succeeded.\n\n\u201cI will say this,\u201d Liora told the willow. \u201cNot many people have hawks complaining to them about their tardiness. Add that to my list of regrets if I get to have any.\u201d\n\nThe northern path opened exactly as it always had, which felt like love. She felt, as she passed the threshold of alder step to stone step, that she would learn the new way to breathe. She felt Vesper\u2019s voice still in her throat. She knew the other princess had the upper hand because she had just reached into Liora\u2019s dream like a woman reaching into an oven to adjust a loaf. But she also knew what it was to hold a stick of wood that remembers a seed. She knew what it was to have a dog who found his way home by simply deciding that home is exactly wherever you are together.\n\n\u201cBramble,\u201d she said, though he was right there. \u201cWe will stay ourselves. That is all we have to do. We keep being ourselves, and we don\u2019t let her give us other names.\u201d\n\nBramble looked up at her, cross-eyed with happiness, with something like: yes. yes. That I can do.\n\nThe wind in the quarry sang an old song. It was a song without words and without a melody that any man could carry; it moved in and out of the ribs of the mountain and made a sound like a long exhale. It had been there before the first princess was born. It would be there after this had been done or had failed. Liora put her comfort in that, because she was human and she would look for any place to put her comfort where it would remain for a finger-width of time.\n\nShe walked, and the path climbed, and sooner than she wished, the trees thinned to stunted pines, their needles like comb-teeth, old resin tears caught in the bark. Once the wind lifted her hair. Once she felt the ground pulse like it had a desire to be nearer the sky. Once she had to put her hand out and rest it on a boulder with a fossil of a fish leaf locked into it, and the stone was warmer than it had any right to be, as if it had been near a hearth.\n\nAt the place where the quarry steps became the first switchback that no one had ever liked, there was a woman sitting on a pack studded with copper rivets, braids lying like bracelets over her shoulders. Elyse. Of course Elyse had come, just to prove Liora wrong. Her mouth was a decision. She raised one eyebrow, and there was humor in it and warning. Beside Elyse, Corin, who had a brow like a door lintel and a way of looking at the world that made it change its mind. He lifted his hand.\n\n\u201cWe thought you\u2019d try for early,\u201d he said. \u201cShade sends the river knights tomorrow because he likes to make an entrance. We left because we like to be where the story is before it begins to be told wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re both ridiculous and useful,\u201d Liora said. Elyse snorted, but the sound made a smile in her throat.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only coming because if you go up there without people you\u2019ll say something like heroish again and I\u2019ll die on the spot,\u201d Elyse said. \u201cI have a weak constitution for poor vocabulary choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeroish,\u201d Corin repeated, and nodded, as if considering the shape of the new word. \u201cIt might be used, if one were careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t encourage her,\u201d Elyse said. Then she stuck out her hand. Liora took it. It felt like a line you throw to someone. It felt like a promise you might return with. It felt like the first chapter pretending to be the second one already, because sometimes you misnumber the ones that matter. The sky hung over them like a lid not yet properly fitted to the pot.\n\nBramble walked under Elyse\u2019s hand and she pretended she did not mean to let it touch him, and then she did, and then she put both hands into Bramble\u2019s fur boldly and made a sound that could only be made when touching a puppy: oh. oh. He looked like he had been touched by the sun.\n\n\u201cWe go then,\u201d Liora said. \u201cBecause if we stand here too long I\u2019ll start to talk. And if I talk too long I\u2019ll start to be afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were afraid when we woke up,\u201d Corin said. \u201cIt makes no difference. We go with it in our pockets, like bread.\u201d\n\nThey went up into the gray with their fear and with their small jokes and with a dog who believed the journey was a long play invented for him alone. Behind them, down in the green-cupped village and in the white-shouldered castle, the lake thumped a patient drumbeat, counting something that nobody had agreed was a number yet. Ahead, northward, there was a bright stain on the sky, green and shaky as certain happinesses, and above it all, the old, old air moved and did not think any of them important. But in the mouths of the new winds the name Vesper curled like a leaf. Liora felt it slide along her neck. She did not quicken or slow her step for it. She held the willow with its hum, and she walked like someone who had not been given the courtesy of postponement. Her hand, when it brushed against Elyse\u2019s, did not shake. It only looked as if it might start to, later, if there were time.",

                              "content": "They began with the small business of walking, which is the same in any world even when the sky mutters to itself and the bones of the mountain click as if resetting. The path shouldered up and around in a steady patience that would have been dull if not for the smell of iron in the air and the way the light to the north kept shifting like a bruise deciding what color to be. Bramble ran reconnaissance on everything three steps ahead, which meant he discovered every prickly plant by embracing it with the whole of his ridiculous body and then looking at Liora as if she had personally invented burrs. Elyse walked as if the slope had been her idea and now she was irritated by her own cleverness; her braids knocked gently against her cloak like a metronome for the day. Corin liked the land, and the land, obliged to be polite back to a man who was polite to it, offered him a firm purchase, except when it didn\u2019t, and then Corin would simply stand and wait five breaths until the stone remembered itself and stopped sliding around under his boots. Liora felt the hum in the willow adjust by degrees as the hours passed and they climbed, not growing louder, but shifting registers the way a throat clears before saying something important.\n\nAt the bald saddle below the first long ridge, they stopped to drink where a trickle ran out of a seam like a vein that had decided to try being a creek. The water tasted faintly of nails and fern, which is not to be ungrateful; sometimes you want your water to remind you that a mountain is made of something more stubborn than sweet. Liora crouched and cupped her hands and let the cold bite. Then she bent and licked one wrist like a cat because there is no proper way to be sure you\u2019re awake except to let the body say so. When she lifted her head there was a skein of geese low over the pass to the west, and in the middle of their voices she thought she heard a thin chord that didn\u2019t belong to any bird she\u2019d ever known. She looked to Corin and he was already squinting at the sky, as if the light contained a message and he had to find the one place it did not expect him to look.\n\n\u201cIf the Spire had only taken the sky, I\u2019d have been less concerned,\u201d he said, serious as the last knot on a net. \u201cThe hills are changing underfoot. We heard it on the Ash Plain. You take three steps and your fourth is a refusal. Then the ground is embarrassed and tries to make up for it. It throws itself up to you and you stumble forward like a drunk who has been helped.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t pretend you\u2019ve never been helped by the earth like that,\u201d Elyse said, smoothing her thumb along the ridges of her palm as if the map of her life were printed there and she was revising it. \u201cI remember a year when we couldn\u2019t get any man to go to harvest without retying all their boots. Everyone was walking like the grass had become a river and we were the stones.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like language,\u201d Liora said, half to herself and half to the willow. \u201cIf you say a word too many times, it stops meaning what it meant. The Spire is saying the word earth so loudly the earth is forgetting what it is, or else it\u2019s remembering some older meaning none of us have learned yet.\u201d\n\nShe pulled her small packet from the top of the pack while they rested, more out of habit than necessity, and touched the folded paper that held the Night-Tears. She did not open it. Beneath the seeds, she had tucked a bit of charcoal and a thin slice of scrap parchment. She wrote in a hand learned under her mother\u2019s strict eyebrows: We are well, for values of well that apply to hills that shrug. The light is a green I do not have a word for. Corin is a piece of good furniture you could stand on to reach a jar on a high shelf. Elyse disapproves of words I invent but only the ones that sound like words I love. Bramble attempted to adopt a hedgehog and failed. If the river knights catch us up, give them my patience and keep yours for yourself. Then she rolled the scrap and slid it into a hollow stem from last summer\u2019s reed she\u2019d brought for exactly that purpose. She made a small hole in the damp earth where the trickle pooled, pressed the reed down, and whispered, \u201cFor the trout, if they\u2019re feeling lettered.\u201d It is not a sure method, but the river has always been nosy.\n\nThe next stretch went under wind that had a logic unlike the usual logic. It did not blow across them; it moved along the ridge like someone sweeping a broom in a long, even stroke. The grasses leaned and then righted themselves, remembering their manners. Liora felt her hair lift once and then settle as if an unseen hand had been checking whether she\u2019d grown. They came up over a lip of stone into a little basin and stopped together because somebody had put a trick into the world there. It was a patch of air with no weather in it, perfectly still, as if the day had a skipped heartbeat. A cloud blew toward it and became a different shape as it crossed, leaner, drawn out, and the shadow it cast on the stones below took on a brighter edge. Corin tossed a pebble and it fell slowly through that patch, changing its mind about speed, as if it had been told a story that made it reconsider its life\u2019s choices. Bramble leapt after the pebble and rose like a bread roll. His paws churned in patient indignation and he looked at Elyse with a betrayed expression that said: You did something to the ground because you love me too much.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t have ideas,\u201d Elyse said, and caught him neatly by the harness at just the spot where dogs forget to be hurt and remember they are loved. \u201cIf you float away I\u2019ll have to go up and get you, and I\u2019ve only brought one pair of good boots.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be more of this the nearer we get,\u201d Corin said, testing the edges with the tip of his staff, which was not willow and did not hum but knew a thing or two about stubbornness. \u201cSaeth said he tied rocks to his feet. He told no lies.\u201d\n\nLiora put the willow out and the air answered. It hummed the way a bottle hums when you run a finger round its rim, and where she moved it the slow-patch learned her shape. She did not have a theory. She only made the motion she had made at the dock when the lake had thought about being a wall and then changed its mind. The word for it had not been coined; that is not uncommon when you are in the habit of doing the thing you are too young to name. The air adjusted, grew less syrup-thick. The pebble sped up. Bramble put his foot down and found a floor where every floor ought to be. They crossed, not disrespecting the strangeness, but declining to be bullied by it, and when they stepped out on the far side everything snapped back into the proper argument between gravity and defiance.\n\nIt was there, beyond that basin, that they first saw the glow like a bruise become a real thing with edges. The Black Spire\u2014only no one with eyes would have called it black if all they knew of it was what it was now. It had been a pillar once, a tooth of basalt with old nests of wind knotted around it, and the witches and wanderers of the north had made their bargains at its foot, no more and no less. Now there was a latticework clinging to it, a scaffolding of light that looked like the inside of a lantern taken apart and set back up by a careless god. From this distance the structure made the Spire seem not taller but wider, as if it had finally decided to occupy all the space it had been promised. The air around it had the quality of glass that has been blown and is cooling: that slightly shifting certainty, that shimmer like heat over a road even though there was no heat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a temple to a new verb,\u201d Elyse said, low, because sometimes words can wound the throat if you put too much mistrust into them and speak too loudly. \u201cI hate it. I have never liked temples to verbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a work,\u201d Corin said, not admiring, not condemning. He was counting in his head how at that distance the ladders must be arranged, how the blocks of old basalt would have had to be cut away so that nothing fell on the wrong head. He hadn\u2019t been asked to build it and so he made a ritual of not guessing what tools had been used.\n\nA pair of figures came out from behind a rock where they\u2019d been shoveling the wind into sacks so it would not go to waste, which is the kind of thing that passes for ordinary work in the north when strangeness has had time to make itself a nest. They were not witches\u2014no felt hats, no smell of rosemary or horsehair\u2014but they had the restless look of people who sleep badly because their thoughts kick them in the ribs. One wore a sheath for a whisk that hung from her belt as if it were a blade. The other had the shoulders of a mason and the eyes of a puppy who had been told to guard the world and did not understand how large the job was.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re out of Woodlake,\u201d the mason said, as if the air had written on Liora\u2019s forehead in a neat hand. \u201cIf you are selling your steadiness we\u2019ll buy a bottle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSteadiness grows wild where we live,\u201d Liora said, because she could not help herself and because the mason\u2019s ears had the exact angle of Saeth\u2019s and she felt like being kind to anyone who might have been his cousin. \u201cWe don\u2019t bottle it. We teach ourselves to drink from the jug.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t go that way,\u201d the whisk-woman said, nodding toward the bare slope that led to a pass Liora would have chosen for its honesty. \u201cThe Glean is there, and the Glean has been arguing with itself for days. If you speak where the wind can hear, it takes that word down into the rocks and brings it back up at you with teeth. We lost a boy to an adjective last week. He said forever in the wrong tone. The echoes held him in place until they forgot what they were doing and let him drop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can go along the sheep-path,\u201d Corin said, relief and worry in the same line of his mouth. \u201cIt takes longer. We will not like it because the stones put their knees in our back and demand we tell them stories.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe stones here are lonely,\u201d the whisk-woman said, and let the handle of her whisk slide into her palm and out again as if she were calming her hands. \u201cThey like to be told there used to be ice over everything. They enjoy it when you remind them of their greatness. If you are kind about it, they will not be unkind.\u201d\n\nLiora thanked them with more than a word, and the mason ducked his head and the whisk-woman lifted her whisk as if in salute. When they were gone, Elyse said, \u201cWhisks,\u201d in a tone of deep betrayal and then laughed helplessly because she was a person who liked her tools to understand what they were and a whisk ready for battle was a step too far for her tidy soul.\n\nThe sheep-path proved to be exactly what people who are not sheep resent: a sequence of choices that made sense only if your feet were small and your balance had been built by a god who had never seen a plumb line. It ran under a mossed lip and over the mouths of three shallow gullies that had decided to spend this season pretending to be rivers and then skittered along a shelf with a drop on one side that was not death but would have felt like betrayal if you\u2019d gone over it. Bramble managed by making himself not look and by putting his body where Liora\u2019s body had been five heartbeats ago, believing in the magic of repetition. Liora put her palm flat to the rock when they paused somewhere not meant to be stopped on and spoke to the stone without any word at all. It is possible to make the sound you would make if you were a cliff and did not wish to fall to pieces, and she made that sound with her breath, short and soft, and the shelf did not grow wider but it did not narrow.\n\nWhen afternoon leaned toward evening they came into a pocket of old birches that had decided, stubborn as saints, to live there despite the wind\u2019s poor behavior. The white skins made the light kinder, and the ground, out of politeness, grew a little bit of soft grass. They made a meal that would count as supper if one had not been introduced to gravy at some point in one\u2019s life: bread that had been stepped on twice inside the pack and honey with needles in it from the north-man\u2019s stall and a piece of cheese that had chosen to sweat and did not mind that choice. Bramble, who had carried his fish this whole time in his mind, settled for a smear of everything and a stick he pretended was a bone of a god. Liora put her hand on the willow and then on the ground in a line, making her small net of not-spells and not-prayers that she had learned without anyone admitting they had taught her. The birches answered with a shiver that was also a hello.\n\nNight in the mountains is a person who does not care that you are a princess. It climbs into your blankets. It steps on your chest with cold feet and then forgets it meant to say sorry. The Spire\u2019s green pulsed through the trunks as if the corners of their camp were the numbers on a slow watch. Liora lay awake longer than she would have liked, counting through all the tiny noises she had no business counting, until she was so tired her thoughts softened at the edges and her body took her without consulting her mind. The dream came edged in metal, which is how you know someone else is leaning on the doorframe of it. She was back on the dock and Vesper was there again, but this time Vesper had mud on her skirts and her hair had been braided by a practical person. It made her look younger, and that made her look more deliberate, and Liora resented the strategy.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve no talent for sleeping without a guard at the door,\u201d Vesper said, conversational as if they\u2019d met over tea in a friend\u2019s kitchen. \u201cI like that in a person. You would not do well in a palace where everyone pretends to nap and actually count each other\u2019s spoons.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you visit everyone,\u201d Liora said, \u201cor am I special in the particular way that makes life inconvenient. I am trying to be flattered, but you are turning the rivers back and I have only four hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would have done this anyhow,\u201d Vesper said, as if Liora had offered an apology for something that required none. \u201cYou were always going to walk up after me. It is better to talk now while our feet are not in the same place. When your boots are standing where mine have, your mouth will be a different instrument. I would like to try my song in you before that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not your hollow bone,\u201d Liora said, and she wanted to be angrier at the way Vesper smiled because it was not the smile of a villain who liked to gloat it was the smile of a girl who had chosen a hill and climbed it and now was surprised to find that at the top there was wind and not a crown. Bramble, asleep beside her body, must have heard some of the shape of these not-words because in the dream he came and stood between Liora and Vesper and that was ridiculous because he was small and Vesper was not and yet the air preferred him and put its head on his back like he was a lap.\n\n\u201cYou are very sweet,\u201d Vesper told the dog, and something in her voice softened into something without sharp corners. Then she looked back up and the softness sharpened because that was exactly what it would do. \u201cLiora. I am not trying to put a bridle on you. I am trying to put a bridle on the world. There\u2019s a difference. It will go better if you are not in my way. Come up when you like. Bring your stick. Bring that boy with the door-brow, the one who will be useful when stones take offense. Bring the woman with the braids so she can say no to you when you have wandered too close to admiration. We will make a shape out of our argument and it will keep the planet from breaking like a plate dropped by an anxious hand. If we are lucky, it will break elegantly. I am, at heart, a generous person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you are at heart,\u201d Liora said, and she dragged at her mind to find the right word and did not because the right word was in a language that had not yet found her, and she hated that Vesper made her feel young in the one way that had nothing to do with how many years any person has had. \u201cYou want to remake the floor because you do not like that it is slanted. You have not considered that most of us have learned to walk on it and that we have turned our unsteadiness into a gift, into dancing. You will take away all our awkward grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cGrace is overpraised,\u201d Vesper said, and the dream wobbled and dropped into the dark like a bucket into a well because the mountain had rolled in its sleep and Liora woke with the taste of green in her throat. Bramble breathed at her cheek in the uncomplicated way of animals who have made one decision and will make it for the remainder of their lives. Elyse snored once and then refused to admit it even to herself. Corin slept on his side with his hands in his belt, a quirk of men who grew up in houses where someone might take what they wanted if they were not careful.\n\nThey broke camp before the light had made all its arguments, because mountains are kinder before the day remembers it could become hot. The sheep-path gave up pretending to be a path and was honest about being a suggestion. The birches let them go with a sentiment Liora could not put into any word she wanted to write down because it was fondness mixed with reluctance mixed with a small ungenerous wish that they might turn back just so the birches would be the ones to have kept them safe. Beyond, the world opened into a shallow bowl of rock and scrub and low thorn where a woman sat on an overturned bucket beside two hives that had been built into the mountain itself, combs sunk into the crevices like books into a shelf. The bees moved in peculiar figure-eights. Liora breathed in and the air had the caramel-bitter of buckwheat and the knife of resin.\n\n\u201cDo they fall when you light them,\u201d Elyse said dryly under her breath, and then ducked when a bee took offense, because bees are never fans of sarcasm.\n\n\u201cThey do as they please,\u201d the woman said, without turning her head, and Liora knew at once that she was one of the old witchers of the north, not because she wore anything that claimed it, not because she had a staff or a bunch of rosemary tied to her belt with red thread, but because the mountain had the look of having agreed to sit with her out of respect and maybe a little fear. \u201cIt\u2019s you, then. The one with a lake in her pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a jug,\u201d Liora said, and the woman smiled but did not show her teeth which told Liora more than if she had. \u201cWe were told the Glean is unkind to words.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs are most places that have been told what to be for too long,\u201d the witcher said. She tapped the side of the hive with her nail and a different note answered from within, a small bell whose clapper had been oiled. \u201cVesper has not only opened the Spire. She has opened the Resonatory under it. It is an old room. It teaches anything inside to learn the song that the sky sang when everything began. The song is not meant to be sung by people. People who listen to it too long either stand up taller or fall over and take the room with them when they go. She has set it ringing. That is what you hear when the river runs wrong. It is the planet trying to hum along. It is doing a poor job. Planets have no ear for music.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow long have you been sitting here,\u201d Corin asked, and his respect made his voice quiet.\n\n\u201cSince before your grandfather wanted to marry the sea,\u201d the witcher said, not as a riddle but because she could not help but put time into family. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a Spire go dark and take three years to be lit. I\u2019ve seen men try to stop it with hammers. They broke their hammers and their hands and went away praising the noise and cursing it in the same breath. I have honey that will make you see the color of wind if you lick it off a knife. I have honey that will make you remember your mother\u2019s anger click when you shut a door. I have none that will make you safe. But I can tell you where the argument in the Glean is thinner. Go under the black rock shaped like a bear. When you come to the place where the wind tries to be your father, befriend it and then betray it quickly. And do not let the mountain make you believe you were born for the sole purpose of being a witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not fond of betrayal,\u201d Liora said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I would make a good partner for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen trick the wind into being your sister instead,\u201d the witcher said, and finally turned her head and looked full at Liora and her gaze was a taste of metal against the tongue. \u201cYou are very tired. The Spire is a magnet and you are iron. Do not be surprised that you point north. But know you can be turned by a touch. Do not let anyone but your own hand lay hold of you.\u201d\n\nBramble stuck his nose toward the hive and then decided this was an arena where bravery would be a bad dog\u2019s kind of bravery. He lay down beside the witcher\u2019s boot and thumped his tail and the witcher, without looking, put her heel against his ribs so he would know he had been counted and approved. Liora exchanged a piece of news for a piece of honey that was the color of a good bruise. The news she gave was that the lake in Woodlake had started trying on different shapes. The witcher took that and set it in her lap as if it were a thing that might begin to move on its own and then she waved them off with the back of her hand with the economy of an old woman who did not need to bless anyone; her existence did enough.\n\nThe bear-rock did in fact look like a bear, but only if you had first made your mind up to see bears in rocks in the manner of children and poets. The Glean hove up around them, though that is not what the Glean looked like; it looked like a notch that had been taken out of the world by a god who needed to measure something and had lost the piece. The wind there did not go across or around. It went up from the ground as if the world were a kettle and the lid did not fit. Liora put her mouth to Corin\u2019s ear at one point, which is something she would not usually have done because his ear had the dignity of a plum, and said, \u201cNo words.\u201d He nodded and pressed his lips together as if the wind might otherwise go in and rummage through what was stored there.\n\nThey moved as if they were not moving, which is the only way to pass a place like the Glean where movement calls attention to itself and the wind wants to applaud. Twice they stepped on words that had been left behind by people who might have thought they were done with them. One word was \u201calmost\u201d and it snagged at Liora\u2019s boot-lace and tried to pull her down into a promise she did not want to make. She stepped out of it the way you step out of a puddle that has become deeper than it promises. One word was \u201cforever,\u201d which lay like a loose board across a gap. Elyse looked at it with ruthless affection, the way you look at a friend who has become inconvenient at a party, and she held out a hand to Liora and they stepped across together, not because the word wanted them to but because their bodies did it as one unit and the word was too surprised to object.\n\nAt the far lip of the Glean the wind tried to be their father, exactly as promised, and it said in the tone of fathers everywhere who have learned worry earlier than most, You will be hurt if you continue. Liora leaned into it and thought of the rejoinder that would leave it chastened and then she did not say it because even if it had been a good line the wind would have taken it from her and used it on some child who did not deserve to be bossed. She put her palm up and the wind put its palm against hers and then she ducked and went under as if it were a low lintel and she had been trained from childhood to avoid doorframes that liked to crack skulls. The wind huffed and then went on about its business with dignity. Corin went under as if bowing to an unworthy magistrate. Elyse went under like the letter S.\n\nThey came, toward evening, to a place where a piece of wall had grown out of the ground for no reason anyone could name, three courses of old stones with lichen and an arrangement of mason-marks that made Corin smile in his bones. Someone had hung a coat there\u2014the black of the roadmen\u2014and beneath the coat a strip of leather with writing burned into it with a heated nail. It said: Two went up. One fell in love with the green and won\u2019t come back. One is still counting. If you pass him tell him we will set his plate by the stove and he is not to become clever. Corin put his fingers on the marks reverently and then he put his forehead against the stone and Liora looked away because sometimes reverence is not for audience. Elyse read the line about becoming clever and rolled her eyes and said, \u201cMen become clever for the same reason women buy sugar: because they think it will sweeten something that doesn\u2019t want to be sweetened and then it ends up everywhere and you\u2019re sticky all day.\u201d Liora kissed her cheek without planning to. The look Elyse gave her afterward was complicated and interesting and very much like the look of a woman who had not meant to step on a word like forever and had done it and then stepped off again later and still noticed the damp mark on her shoe. They did not discuss it and that was all right for that minute and perhaps not for other minutes to come.\n\nThey made their beds that night under a dripstone that had tamed itself into a ledge where no drip had fallen in at least a century. The Spire\u2019s glow was stronger and did not pretend to be anything but a summons. Campfires moved along the far flanks of the valley like eyes. Liora could tell which fires belonged to those who had gone up for the thrill because their flames sawed at the air and the smoke ran in excited lines. There were fires that belonged to those who had been paid in coin and there were fires that belonged to those who had been paid in grief. She put the Night-Tears in the ground by the dripledge and pressed the soil over them firmly because seeds like a firm hand. She poured a spoon of water and then another because you never know what you will regret not watering later. \u201cIf we come back this way,\u201d she told them, \u201cbe either up or gone. Sleeping seeds give me a worse resentment than men who explain lock mechanisms to me while holding my own keys.\u201d\n\nBramble took the watch of his choice, which is to say the middle one where nothing rational happens and everything else does, and he did it by sleeping with one paw on each of their ankles so that if someone moved the dog would know right away. Liora lay and listened to the green, which had become a buzzing now, not mechanical, not bee, more like the sound a raven makes in your throat when you try to call it and it decides it will come to you because you are ridiculous and need to be humored. Just before sleep took her all at once there was the sound of a man coming up a slope with no care for stealth and yet no foolish noise either. She sat up so fast her cloak tried to strangle her because it was a garment that resented haste. Corin woke with his hand already on the small hammer that took the place of his temper when he could not find it. Elyse had a knife in her hand before anyone else\u2019s eyes knew to see her hand.\n\nHe came into the circle of their watch-light and set down his pack and in the pack\u2019s leather there was a river stitched, which is how you know a knight who rides water when he does not ride horses. He had an oar in one hand and a spear in the other, which is an elegant and absurd way to walk through a mountain. He was young enough to have hope in his eyebrows and old enough to have folded his boyhood and put it away without looking at it lately. He grinned at the dog first, because any man who denies a dog is a man who will deny himself later and should be corrected by the next convenient aunt. Bramble, who knew nothing of knights but knew how to weight a lap, climbed into the knight\u2019s lap like it had been built to his specifications.\n\n\u201cShade sends regards,\u201d the river knight said, and he sat where Bramble had insisted and the seat became a throne even though it was a rock. \u201cHe says to tell the mountain if it trips you it will answer to him and then he laughed like he laughs when he has just put a spear through a fish who thought itself cleverer than any man alive. I am Tern. I came early because a roadman passed our boathouse and his letter had news in it that would go stale if the sun touched it twice. They say Vesper has called a wind from under the Spire that counts. It is counting down.\u201d He opened his hand and there on his palm was a little disc of hammered tin that had been rubbed with charcoal and counted upon by a nervous thumb. There were nine marks in a circle and one had been smudged as if it had been erased by a rude hand. \u201cThey say tomorrow it will be eight. Shade says to tell you if you mean to stand there and say no you had better have the kind of no that does not blow away in a strong breath.\u201d\n\nLiora put her fingers to the tin and the tin was warm and then it was cold because she was frightened and her body had not known it properly until now. The mountain made the sound of an animal remembering it was hungry. The green light shifted and put a shawl around their shoulders and then threw it off again as if it had been scolded for acting familiar. She looked at Corin and Elyse and Tern and at Bramble, who had settled on Tern\u2019s knees with the certainty of saints, and she thought she would try to sleep again because there would be less time to be afraid if she did. The willow lay along her spine like a hand. The world counted and somewhere, in the notch of an old drum, the lake kept time with the sort of patience that is not kind and not unkind, but simply is. She closed her eyes and kept them closed even when the wind said her name in a voice she might once have called beautiful and would never call anything again except hungry.",

                              "content": "Morning did not so much arrive as rub its eyes and sit up with a groan, and every rock for half a league made the same slow sound of finding its joints. The green light from the Spire had softened while they slept, as if it too had needed to blink. Tern was already on his feet when Liora pushed out of her blanket, the tin disc on his palm held up to the light like a small moon being judged. One of the charcoal tics had become a smear that would not quite wipe away, and in its place the emptiness felt like a mouth breathing. He turned it so it would catch the shadow of his thumb and looked relieved to see that the missing mark had not crept back in the night and made liars of them all.\n\n\u201cIt took one,\u201d he said in the tone of someone announcing that a rival had stolen a spoon. \u201cShade says he\u2019s never liked a count he cannot argue with. This one does not argue back. It simply goes on with its business.\u201d\n\nLiora put her hand over his and the metal kissed her skin with the faintest sting, like a nettle that wanted to be polite. She did not think there was a device in it any more than there had been a device in the lake when it threw itself on the dock like a friend who has learned wrestling. It felt like the tin was being taught to be less tin. The willow leaned in its quiet way toward the disc and did not hum so much as clear its throat delicately. In the long list her mother had taught her\u2014Count spoons. Count people. Count the cows twice if they are all in the same field because cows have ambitions\u2014Liora had never been taught what to do about a count that did not belong to anyone and still ruled the air.\n\nThey ate a poor breakfast with the solemnity of a feast. Bread, which had decided in the night to lose an argument with damp. Cheese, which did not care what anyone thought of it. Honey from the witcher that stained their tongues briefly with the color of pewter and then changed its mind and let them have the color of summer. Bramble disposed of pebbles and twigs with dedication and eyed the cheese as if it were a badger he would eventually befriend through persistence and flattery. They stamped the last of the fire to ash and Liora, because it felt proper, told the ash, \u201cStay, if you can,\u201d and the ash said nothing because ash is the least sentimental substance in the world.\n\nThey kept to the line of the wall that had climbed out of the earth like an old thought that wanted to be looked over one more time. The man who had promised not to become clever had not left the vicinity; they found him one bend on with his back against a slab and his eyes as steady as a pair of stones in a river. He did not look up as they came near; he was counting, and not in numbers that belonged to money or sheep. He counted in breaths that forgot where their edge was. Liora heard the rhythm first and then the numbers under it and then the absence of any number that would be useful to a merchant. He was saying the days since he had come up, and the days since any person had tried to touch him, and the days since the wind had said his name and he had said no.\n\n\u201cDo you want a piece of bread,\u201d Elyse asked, and because she spoke without trying to be kind, only trying to be correct, he looked up and took it from her hand and forgot once where his count had been and flinched at the lost place like a man who has been told to stop in the middle of a drumbeat. Tern sat down beside him as if they were cousins and put the tin on his knee. The counter\u2019s gaze slid to it and snagged and he made a small hurt sound through his teeth.\n\n\u201cIt will be eight before dark,\u201d he said. \u201cEight is a fair number. It makes neat halves and quarters, and when you split it you feel you\u2019ve done something tidy. It pretends to be friendly, and in that it is treacherous, because it is no more our friend than nine, which is a boastful number, or seven, which is a number that believes in its own stories. I have been trying to convince the wind to stop counting there, because eight makes men put their tools away and tell themselves there is time, and then they go to sleep and never wake up. The wind keeps learning the wrong lessons from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens when it reaches nothing,\u201d Corin asked, and then did the politeness of saying, \u201cForgive me. We\u2019ve none of us ever liked to say that word.\u201d He tapped the stone with his knuckles and the stone answered him with the hollow ring of a thing that is thinking about counting too.\n\n\u201cIt will try to do the new thing,\u201d the man said, and wiped the heel of his hand along his jaw as if there were a word stuck to it and he\u2019d like it gone. \u201cWhen a child gets to the end of a set of stairs he will sometimes leap. It\u2019s like that. There are those who will tell you it will be like unclasping a necklace that has been strangling our necks for a thousand years. There are those who will tell you it will be like opening your own mouth and pulling your heart out to see if it still moves. Vesper says both on alternate days, and she believes herself each time.\u201d\n\nLiora crouched. She had not noticed until she was close that the man had a string around his wrist, just as the boy at the gate had. It had been tied too tight and had bitten him in. She slid a nail under the knot and loosened it without asking. He did not blush at the kindness and that told her he had been up here longer than his beard suggested. \u201cWill you come back down when your count is done,\u201d she said, and waited through the panic that rose in him like heat off a forge.\n\n\u201cIf I come down it will mean I have not mistaken the wind\u2019s voice for the voice of God,\u201d he said, as if he were reading from a letter echoed back to him. \u201cIt will mean my wife will know she is a widow only in the way she likes, not in the way people in this part of the world mean it. It will mean I will confess that I cannot keep a thing from happening by naming the steps that lead to it, and I have always liked to believe in the strength of names.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome down for your supper,\u201d Tern said, practical as salt. \u201cYour plate is by the stove and your friends told me to tell you to wash your hands before you touch it. There\u2019s a child who sits on the stoop who asks if the green is as green up here as it looks from there. He only has the one question and he has been saving it for you. If you don\u2019t come down I will tell him it is half the green he thinks, because spite is good for the young.\u201d\n\nThe man smiled despite himself, and in that smile Liora saw a person who had once been able to dance on a slant floor and not worry about grace. He stood very carefully as if he were afraid he had become the hinge on which the mountain swung and did not want to creak. When he had proven his bones still belonged to him, he lifted his eyes toward the Spire and bowed to it like a fellow with respect for a thing he does not admire. \u201cKeep your words,\u201d he said to Liora, \u201con a string you can pull back. She is good at stealing. She will not take from your pockets. She will take with compliments.\u201d He started down the path with the walk of a man who has remembered he is very tired and very hungry, and at the curve he looked down and called, \u201cIf you see the one who fell in love with the green, tell him I said he is not to be clever either and that I am not angry, only disinclined to forgive a man who chooses a color over a spoon.\u201d\n\nThey did not encounter the green-eyed deserter. They did meet three youths with bees stitched in gold along the sleeves of their jackets, which would have looked like a joke if the jackets had not been smeared with real pollen. The youths had been given a task and were taking it devoutly: they were catching loose words in long cotton bags and smacking the bags smartly against rocks until the words were stunned enough to be carried to their new hive. Each time they opened a bag, a sentence would fly out and make a bright angry sound like a letter caught in a door. One of the sentences said, Let me go you fools, and Elyse, who had been about to praise their ingenuity despite herself, shut her mouth and went fierce.\n\n\u201cYou do not bag a sentence like that,\u201d she told the tallest, who wore his hair with a carelessness that had to be practiced. \u201cYou put it down on the table and pour it tea and tell it your friend died once and the sentence will sit and look at you and become quieter. Then you can use it again. You do not beat it against a rock. Words remember. Treat them as if they had a spine.\u201d\n\nThe tall youth looked chastened and then made a face as if being told to be gentle with an abstract thing had pressed the bruise of his own daily fear too hard. He took the bag down and opened it and the sentence shot out and stood in front of Elyse like a crow that will come to your shoulder if you do not look at it directly. It tilted its head and thought about pecking and then it hopped and settled itself inside the open space of her hand, which is a thing some sentences will do if you have never lied to yourself about why you are using them. Elyse shut her fingers. \u201cSit,\u201d she told it, as if it were a dog. It did.\n\nThere were camps now, not just the scatter of small fires but proper camps like a braid of thought woven around a difficult idea. One camp belonged to the masons, and in it men and women with poor knees and excellent backs whittled the corners of blocks that hummed when you touched them, which is a reason to be gentler with corners than you might be. One camp belonged to the witchers and there were charms hung like laundry between poles and every charm had something in it that had once been alive and had given up gracefully. One camp belonged to those who came because they loved spectacle. There were banners there that swore by colors and made no mention of names, and Liora felt a homesick ire rise up in her throat, because color is what we have left when we have spent all our names and she did not like to see it put to wages. Tern walked through all of it with the bored air of a man who has escorted casks past a great many parties and knows he will do so through to the end of his days and will neither join nor condemn.\n\nAt the edge of the last of the makeshift cities there was a long low building that had not been there three days ago because the grass under it still had the shape of its former intent. It was all glass that had found a way to become a wall again after years of having forgotten how, and through the glass Liora saw a room lined in blue stone. Men and women at the far end stood at a bank of things that were not quite instruments and not quite dolls. They moved their hands through frames of light and their hands came away smelling like rain. In the very center, beneath a dome that had been polished to the verge of offense, a column of not-light rose out of the floor and made the hairs on Liora\u2019s arms leap to attention. For a breath she was back at the lake, but this time the view did not close itself off when she moved. She touched the glass with her forefinger and the glass took her pulse and held it to its surface like a coin pressed under a piece of paper and rubbed with graphite.\n\n\u201cShe has opened another of the rooms,\u201d Corin murmured, his mouth so near the glass that his breath came back at him with a stranger\u2019s smell. \u201cWe were told there were rooms under the Spire where the old ones taught themselves to be worse than gods and better than accidents. That one\u2019s a tuner. It\u2019s teaching itself how to make a note that will untie a knot.\u201d He looked ill now, not because he did not love work but because he did love it and this was work that took the floor out from under his feet and told him swimming was work too and how had he not known.\n\n\u201cDoors,\u201d said a woman at Liora\u2019s shoulder, and Liora realized she had come up and stood very close indeed to a person who did not look like she meant to ever be far away from any event. The woman\u2019s hands had scars on the palms that meant she had once grabbed a rope that did not want to be grabbed, and the rope, being a rope, had taught her its opinions. \u201cThey\u2019re all doors, these rooms. We had to kick at this one until it decided kicking was conversation. I nearly broke my foot, which made me laugh, which made the room offended in a way that told me it had a sense of humor it wasn\u2019t using.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes it matter to it if we go in and admire the furniture,\u201d Elyse asked. She had put her palms flat to the glass as a test of whether the room would be rude enough to touch back. It did not. It let her feel nothing at all, which was a different sort of rudeness. \u201cWill it be kinder if we tell it it\u2019s pretty.\u201d\n\nThe woman grinned, the kind of grin that made Liora think of her mother\u2019s friend who could turn any lock with the hairpins she wore for decoration. \u201cIt will be kinder if you do not expect kindness. It will be more honest if you address it like a beast who could chew your hand off but is too full to bother if you speak nicely. Are you the wood lake girl. Vesper says you have the sort of face people would confess to and then regret. She likes regret. It makes people tidy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell your princess,\u201d Liora said, feeling the heat that came up her neck when she was told she had a face that did not belong to her, \u201cthat if she wanted my face here she should have come down and asked for it in daylight. She preferred the dark. That tells me the number of her bravery.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe prefers the stage where her audience listens,\u201d the woman said without malice. She had turned her injured hands over and was tracing the scars with the tenderness people reserve for proof they have lived. \u201cShe likes a bowl to speak into. The mountain is a good bowl. The sky will carry her voice to the snow. You will go up and say no in the way of people who have been taught to say no the first time they are asked and to say yes only after they\u2019ve decided on their own. That will bring her more joy than if you had said yes at once. Opposition makes a shape from nothing. If she likes you she will try to make you into a hinge.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a hinge,\u201d Liora said. \u201cI am wood. I may be planed smooth but I remember seed.\u201d It was foolish to tell that to a stranger in this place, and yet the stranger\u2019s eyebrows jumped in the way Corin\u2019s did when someone used a name for a tool correctly, and she nodded as if given a secret handshake that had been out of fashion for a hundred years.\n\nThey stepped away from the glass because it is never wise to stare too long at anything that pretends to be empty when it is full, and came into a corridor where a rope sang. It did so without being touched. It was strung between two posts that were not exactly posts\u2014more the notion of standing\u2014and the rope was plaited of something that had once looked like hair and now looked like iron that had remembered a childhood. The note it made was not a note any throat would want to make, but it threaded itself through Liora\u2019s teeth and then through the willow and tightened. The noise made Tern flinch and then he set his jaw and the jaw was the jaw of a man who has rowed upstream in flood and counted each insult the river had given him and added it to a store of debt he meant to collect when he had time.\n\n\u201cTouch nothing,\u201d Elyse said, which is the line of anyone who has had to clean up after men who pretend curiosity is a virtue unshared by others. Bramble sat with his occurrence of perfect behavior and made his ears do that little lift they did when he believed he had done something to deserve a fish. He had not. Liora bent without putting her hands near the rope and put her face very close so she could smell it. It smelled like storms and the inside of a library, and that unsettled her more than if it had smelled of blood. Knowledge has always had the ability to be misused, but the rope smelled like a thing that did not understand misuse, only use, and in that she had to respect it even as she wanted to put it in a cupboard and shut the door.\n\n\u201cYou made your lake sit down,\u201d said a boy behind them with blue snuff on his nose and a set of calluses that said he had been scolded by flint more than once in his life. \u201cCan you make this stop singing. It sings the tune my brother was given when he went into the river and did not come out, and I don\u2019t want to be told again what I already know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI made the lake remember itself,\u201d Liora said. \u201cI can ask the rope to forget. Whether it does is the rope\u2019s business.\u201d She spoke to it with the palm of her hand, not by touching it\u2014her mother had taught her long ago that if you ask a cat to come you do not pursue it; you make yourself interesting and let the cat claim you. She made herself into the absence of sound for the length of one breath and then for the length of three, and then she let her breath out and the rope gave up a note that was lower and lazier, like a rest in a hymn. The boy cried once, short, and then stuck his fist in his mouth as if he had a tooth loose and did not want anyone to see.\n\nWhen they came up to the beginning of the black stairs that had been cut into the first skin of the Spire, a woman with a braid of hair so long it could have choked a river stood with a rod and tapped each boot as it passed. Corin watched carefully and saw that she was not counting people; she was telling the stairs the shape of each foot and asking the stone to see them as individuals rather than a mass. Masses are too easy to roll down a hill. Her rod was made of old bronze with a collar of jet, and the jet had a crack in it and through the crack you could see that it had learned to love being broken. She glanced at Liora\u2019s willow and at Tern\u2019s oar and at Elyse\u2019s knives and each time one object showed too much pride she tapped it, and the sound was the sound of a child being told to tuck in its shirt. Liora, who had never in her life obeyed a request to tuck in a shirt unless it pleased her, still found herself standing straighter.\n\n\u201cYou will want to stop two turns below the white shelf with the pigeons painted on,\u201d the woman said with a patience that had been purchased at decent cost. \u201cYou will not be able to help yourselves. The song is thin there and goes like sugar in tea. If you stop there, leave a part of yourself behind on purpose\u2014a hair, a nail paring, a curse\u2014so that when you come away the cliff does not keep more than its share. There are children that stand there all day licking the air. We push them off when we can. Vesper hates us for that and loves us for doing it when she cannot bear to. Do not leave your dog, for the love of anything you name. The Spire will convince itself it has become his mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would burn it down first,\u201d Elyse said in a tone that made the woman look at her properly and decide to like her at once.\n\nThe stairs were not innumerable. That was the worst of them. They could be counted, and anything that can be counted can be finished, and the knowledge that there was a top and that in reaching it they would be expected to be ready was a cruelty Liora would have liked to return to its sender. They climbed into light that had the taste of copper pennies. Once a white moth brushed Liora\u2019s cheek and was dragged backward by nothing she could see and turned in the air with an affronted dignity and tried again. Once a ladder leaned past them, made of light exactly as Saeth had said, and three men in harnesses climbed it as if they had always been climbing light. Once a woman in a smear of red paint came down past them without moving any muscle she did not need and said aloud to no one, \u201cWe will need another kind of link. We will need a braid that doesn\u2019t mind being forgotten by the hair that made it,\u201d and Corin made a note on his skin in pencil because there was no other paper that would please him more at this altitude.\n\nThey stopped two turns below the white shelf with pigeons right where the rod-woman had told them they would, as if the path had leaned out and made a place exactly Liora-shaped, and the song slid around their ankles and their wrists with the tenderness of a snake that has decided not to bite this once. Liora did as she\u2019d been told and pulled a hair and wrapped it around the head of a nail she carried in her pouch, then pressed it into a crack where the stone would think itself clever for hiding it. Elyse set down a curse, but because her curses were beautifully made and had all their seams turned and pressed, the wind could not find its way into it and so the curse sat there like a tidy hen until a passing mason lifted it up and put it in his pocket because it was a good one and he might need it later. Tern swore in the language river-men use when the keel staves and their hands are bleeding and then he cut the oath in half with his teeth and spat one piece to the left and one to the right and the wind had to split to fetch it and they walked through the gap. Bramble put his paw on Liora\u2019s boot to inform her a bee had gotten into his brain and was making him think about soup. She told him no with her eyebrows and he blinked three times and the bee left and went to bother a boy who did not have eyebrows his mother had taught to say no.\n\nThe white shelf had been painted with pigeons by someone who had either loved pigeons or hated them and Liora, who had never held a strong opinion on the subject, found herself full of a resentful affection for birds who did not know they were art. There were people there, just as the rod-woman had said, with their mouths open a little, faces relaxed in the way of people who have finally had the noise in their heads matched by a noise outside and found it a relief. Vesper had put a woman there with a bell and a pole and the woman went around and rang the bell in front of every mouth with a beat that said wake, wake, wake, and some did and some did not, and the bell-woman\u2019s mouth tightened in a way that said she would ring the bell until her hand fell off, and then ring it with the other hand. When the bell came near Liora it did not strike, and Liora thought: she told her to spare us this scolding, and the bell-woman\u2019s eyes flicked over and said: do not be flattered. Bramble, to whom bells are either toys or threats with nothing between, growled and then sneezed and the sneeze had a dignity that made two children laugh and then stop, embarrassed, because they had been given a new habit and had not yet learned where not to put it.\n\nThey reached the last turn and there, not waiting with ceremony or guard, stood Vesper. There was no crown. There were no bees. She had dirt under her nails. If you were hunting for theatricality you would have to go and find it for yourself and bring it to her, and she would decide whether to keep it. She did not say Liora\u2019s name. She did not say any name. She looked at Liora the way you look at a mirror that you sometimes hate because it shows you what you are doing to your own face.\n\n\u201cYou came quicker than I had thought,\u201d she said, and her voice was not winded at all. \u201cGood. We have been busy. You can be shown the proof and then you may say your piece.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had my ear to the water and my mouth full of your breath since you climbed,\u201d Liora said, and she stepped so that Elyse remained by her shoulder and Corin where he could see the corners of things and Tern with his spear which had been made of oak that had changed its mind and become iron and then back again twice. \u201cI have seen your rooms. I have watched the river men tie rocks to their boots so they would not be flung around by the laughter of the plain. I\u2019ve had a woman who loves witches more than they love themselves tell me you have set the Resonatory to ring. I have stepped through a patch of air that had become an argument. Is there any proof you could show me that could be more than the proof of being here.\u201d\n\nVesper laughed once, a small sound that went into the rock as if the mountain were a lover she had tapped on the shoulder. \u201cThere is the proof of pattern,\u201d she said, and she stood aside so that they could see past her into the mouth of the Spire. It had not had a mouth three months before. Now it had the kind of mouth old things have when they are tired of being closed. The stairs within were not stairs any longer; they were a slope made of interrupted light. It was not color; it was one of those not-lights, but arranged into planks the size of the shoulders of a careful man. It was the sort of thing anyone would be tempted to step onto and then think better of and then step onto anyway because the temptation of not tripping was too much.\n\nVesper led them without turning to make sure they followed. That angered Elyse irrationally and she did not say anything because she did not wish to watch Vesper turn and collect her words as if they were coins dropped by a careless rich woman. Corin lagged once by a little alcove where a piece of machinery sat that looked like a child\u2019s toy. It was glass spun around a spindle and when you blew across the top of it the glass sang with a human voice. A man was kneeling by it with his ear against it as if to hear a wound knit. He was crying in a fully engaged manner because whatever he had been told to fix was something no tool could reach, and that is the way men who love work cry when they finally are given proof that sometimes there is no work to be done except to stop.\n\nThey came into a room that Liora recognized without wanting to from the lake\u2019s first vision. Blue stone. A ceiling polished so diligently it had become insult. At the far end, two figures stood within a cage of light like a net turned inside-out. One of them was reciting the names of colors as if that would keep him where he was supposed to be. The other was counting down in a voice like the road at midnight. A column rose behind them, taller than any column has any right to be, and if you looked aside even a little it did not exist, and if you tried to grab it with your eyes it shoved your gaze down your throat and made it sit there like a badly chewed bite of meat. Along the wall, on low tables, lay maps that made the map in the room at Woodlake look like a child\u2019s paper crown, and Liora\u2019s heart leapt and hated itself for leaping because she adores a neat map more than many better people adore their own children. These maps were not drawn. They were a stitching of laid nerves. The mountain itself had been asked to provide its lines.\n\n\u201cOnce,\u201d Vesper said, and the room adjusted itself to a better listening shape as if it had leaned in, \u201csomething opened here. It was not a portal and it was not a mouth. It was a forgetting. Alderra forgot itself at this point exactly and began to be something else, and then it remembered itself poorly and was ashamed and put stones over the shame. People built shrines to the shame. That is what we always do. When grief grows its own ribs we hang medals on it and pretend we did that on purpose. The old ones\u2014call them the builders, call them the mothers, call them the idiots with room in their heads for everything but love\u2014made a set of rooms where they could come to push at the world. I have opened them. It was not hard. Locks are for people who wish to think they can stay out. Rooms wish to be rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it you wish me to see,\u201d Liora asked, and she put her hand behind her and found Elyse\u2019s wrist and wrapped her fingers around it and felt the pulse there insult the notion that anything large could make them small.\n\n\u201cThat the count is not me,\u201d Vesper said, and it was the first time she had said anything that felt naked enough to be true. \u201cI am not the song. I am the bell. I did not invent the river; I moved the rock that made the water change its mind. You will call me arrogant because it is easier to hate a person than a room. Do me the credit of hating the correct thing. If you must hate me, hate me later. We are at eight. We will be at seven by the time you have stopped holding your breath. Liora of Woodlake\u201d\u2014she said the name like it was the answer to a riddle that had satisfied her\u2014\u201cif you stand with me we can make the end a good one. If you stand apart we will still make it, but it will be uglier, because you will force me to be interesting, and I do not like being interesting when I work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no interest in helping you find a more elegant way to break the dishes,\u201d Liora said, and she was surprised to find her voice smooth and not dripping with all the things she would have liked to pour into it. \u201cIf you are not the count, it does not exonerate you from waking it. A man who shakes a sleeping hound and says, see, the hound has always had teeth, is a very fine sort of liar, and I would not trust him with my favorite shoe.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t,\u201d Vesper said, and for the first time her smile looked like it belonged to her and not to her idea of herself. \u201cTrust me with nothing. Bring your staff. Bring your dog. Bring your stubborn mind put together out of reeds and old paper and bake-oven heat. Stand opposite. We will make a shape between us that the world can lean on when it begins to tilt.\u201d She lifted her hand and the note in the room shifted and went through Liora\u2019s mouth and made it open a little. The taste was like ice and iron. It made her think of her mother\u2019s handwriting. It made her think of how it had felt to be told at ten that she would be a cupboard if she kept all her thoughts under lock and key. She swallowed and the taste went down and became something else in her belly that she would have to name later.\n\nTern had not spoken, and now he did. He spoke like a man who has stood on a boat that was not sure it wanted to be a boat any longer. \u201cIf we walk out of here and tell the mountain to sit, Will it sit. If we take our oars and push you off your little island will you fall. If we tell the count to go to hell will it go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you can say hell in the right tone,\u201d Vesper said, and her eyes slid to him and away because he was not the one she wanted to be speaking to, \u201cyou can teach water to burn. I have no interest in stopping you from attempting. The work is already doing the work. I prefer assistance to opposition, but I am not above using opposition like a brick. Stand where you like.\u201d\n\nCorin breathed, finally, like a man who had forgotten it was an option. He laid his broad palm on the blue stone at his hip with the affection of one who speaks to walls at night when there is no person to hear. \u201cThere is a weakness where you have cut,\u201d he said, nosily, like a cousin who will not be silent at wakes. \u201cYour light-planks nest badly over that seam. You will fall through if a child jumps. You are proud enough to like to be warned well. Consider yourself warned.\u201d\n\nVesper\u2019s head tipped. Her mouth did a not-smile that Liora saw and recognized and disliked and could not help admiring because it was like her mother\u2019s when told someone had made a clever mistake. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, and it carried no mockery, and at once a woman with a braid like rope and a man with a pencil tied to his wrist leapt into the net of light and fixed the seam as if it had insulted a guest. \u201cYou see, Liora. It is much better to have people around who do not wish to be here. They tell the truth as a matter of principle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll choose a place,\u201d Elyse said briskly. She had not gone all small under the weight of the room and Liora took in a breath of her as one breathes at a window. \u201cWe\u2019ll choose a place to stand where your noise cannot hide our no. If you want us to save your work from your own cleverness, we\u2019ll send you an invoice. If you want us to keep children from standing in the sugar, we\u2019ll use our bell. If you want us to be your vanity\u2019s polishing-cloth, you may invent a better request.\u201d\n\nVesper inclined her head as one does when one has been spoken to by someone who knows the exact weight of her own refusal. \u201cThere,\u201d she said. \u201cBy the column, not under it, where your dog won\u2019t be convinced he is the size of a bear. The count will be six by then. It may be five if the river in the west decides to practice running up hill again. Go and rest where the pigeons are painted. Even saints require soup.\u201d She lifted her hand and the room exhaled them. The light-ladders drew themselves up so they would not be stepped on as if by a child who doesn\u2019t want his toys muddied. Outside, the sky had been stained an earnest green that looked like vigor; you could fool yourself into thinking it was health. The tin in Tern\u2019s hand had grown cooler.\n\nThey found a place to make a day\u2019s home under a scarp from which roots trailed like hair washed and left to dry. The camps had learned to give them room not out of courtesy but out of mistrust that had agreed to try the shape of respect for an evening. Corin set stones in a small circle and spoke to them until they consented to be a hearth. Elyse set her knives in a line along the lip of the scarp with their blades toward the mountain, an impoliteness that would be understood by anyone with sense as a sign of watchfulness and not hostelry. Tern went to stand where he could see the river\u2014far to the east, a thread of metal that had taken an oath not to behave normally\u2014and he whistled once in a manner Shade would hear if a heron were the messenger. Liora unwrapped her packet with the seeds she had carried and looked at the little drawing of the bell-shaped bloom with its mouth shut and decided that even here, perhaps especially here, a bell with no mouth belonged.\n\nShe pressed three Night-Tears into the thin soil and tamped them down with the pad of her thumb. She told them a story about a boy with a piece of string around his wrist and his insistence that string could keep him from falling away. She told them about a dog who believed he could be the mother of any child if the child consented to be licked. She told them about a lake that had wanted to be a wall and had chosen instead to be a lake. She told them about a princess who did not like being given a place to stand by someone else but would stand there anyway if it meant keeping children\u2019s mouths shut when the sugar sang. The green over the world brightened because it liked stories when they were told by people standing with their backs to a cliff and their faces to the wind. Bramble lay with his chin on Liora\u2019s knee, and when his eyes rolled up to look at her there were a thousand small reflections of the Spire\u2019s light there, which is how you learn what kinds of lights your world has, because there is no mirror like a good dog\u2019s eyes.\n\nToward sunset, a sound came up from the very bones. It was not the count. It was an announcement. A drumming that had more joy in it than threat, more insistence than grace. Liora felt the beat take the shape of her chest and fit itself there like a hand. The pigeons on the shelf looked as if they might lift. Elyse\u2019s braids knocked like a clock. Corin\u2019s brow learned a new crease. Tern, who was dipping his tin in cold water to make it change its mind about being a witness for a moment, came up fast, water in his beard, and held the disc out like a plate to catch falling bread. There were seven marks left, clean and terrible, and there were not seven, because at that same beat the first of the marks blurred and went dark and made a confession: it had never been a mark, it had been a hole.\n\nThe mountain said, as mountains do when no one listens and so they speak to the very few who will, Prepare, and the word did not go into their ears but up through their feet. Liora put her hand on the willow and the willow shivered and became a little more than a stick and a little less than a tree. She did not look for Vesper in the doorway of the blue room. She did not ask the air how many times it had learned to be this particular shade. She looked at her companions and at the dog and she let the count settle in her bones and she named the numbers to herself in the language of her mother\u2019s ledger and of boys tying string. She named them in bread and in apples and in the steps between two stones. There was soup to be heated. There were knives to be sharpened. There were pigeons to not eat. There was a woman with a bell who would come if called and would ring her arm off because it is those with bells who save us. There were two nights perhaps, or one, or half a one.\n\nShe slept with all her faults on, because there is no point polishing your conscience when you intend to take it into a place where everything will be scratched. The wind came and it said her name again and she did not open her eyes. It said it prettier and she did not open them. It tried a harsher sound because it had learned a little of her and misapplied its knowledge and she laughed in her sleep because she owned that sound and no one else did. When she woke, the green had grown honest enough to be sickly, and the tin disc had made up its mind to show six. The mountain clicked. Somewhere in Woodlake, a dock creaked and Bramble\u2019s cousins barked at puddles too small to deserve barking. Liora tied her hair back with a piece of cord that had once bound three letters to a trout. She stood up into the day and found it waiting, as days will when they cannot wait any longer.",

                              "content": "The count wore six like a ring that fit too well, and everyone on the mountain felt their finger bones under it. Morning stretched itself into something braced, like a beam set under a roof that might decide to sag. Men sat in their shirts and boots and stared at steam as if it might give advice, and women plaited their hair tighter than they needed to, knots made as if to hold in thoughts that might otherwise leap away into the green. Liora woke with her mouth dry and a small sore spot on her cheek where the willow had pressed in the night; it had left a miniature crescent, a reminder that even friends make their marks when you sleep too close. Bramble had made a decision to be a stone and had placed himself across her ankles so that all the dreams that wanted to run away would have to ask him for permission first. When she eased free he rolled to present a ribcage and made the sound that meant he would forgive her for absolutely everything if she engaged with his fur for half a minute with all the intensity of princes at councils. She obliged, and the morning decided it wouldn\u2019t be able to knock her entirely awry while she still smelled like dog.\n\nIt turned out that Shade had sent two, after all. The second river knight came up with a little boat on his back, a thing so narrow and quick it looked like a blade that had elected to be a fish instead. He had carried it by a strap across his brow so that his hands would be free for the oar and for the spear, and he had the particular walk of a man who could go down anything without trusting his knees to stop him at the bottom. He set the boat down with care that made Corin smile despite himself and scratched Bramble without asking permission, because the boat had counted as an introduction. \u201cKite,\u201d he said, as if his name were a direction. \u201cShade says we\u2019re to keep anyone who doesn\u2019t belong out of the water, which is very funny given that all this is water pretending to be other things. Also this is for you.\u201d He drew a coil from the hollow under his boat\u2019s seat; it was a braid, three colors of rope twisted into one. It had the look of a thing that had been made in a hurry by someone who knew their hands too well to do it badly. It glinted along one side, and Liora saw that catgut had been spliced with river-reed with a single hair wrapped through, the hair so pale it might have been a light. \u201cWe heard someone say you\u2019d need a braid that doesn\u2019t mind being forgotten by the hair that made it. Shade told me to make one and then forgot he had. That\u2019s how I knew I\u2019d done it right.\u201d\n\nElyse took the braid as if she were accepting a baby who\u2019d been handed to her by a man who had never held one and was trying very hard not to drop it. She weighed it and ran it between her fingers, testing for arrogance. \u201cIt will slip when asked and hold when not,\u201d she said, eyes narrowed because praise is a delicate substance and must be applied evenly or it will run. \u201cI don\u2019t like it. That may be why it\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nThe camps around them had already learned the new rhythm of the day. At first the green had been a novelty that made people talk too fast; now it was an imposition that made them wash their spoons with intent. The bell-woman had new assistants, boys too young and old women too stubborn, each with a smaller bell that had their own names burned into the handles so that the wind would know them and be polite when told to move. The masons took down a light-ladder and put up a real one in its place where the seam had sulked, because light is very clever until it forgets to be wood, and then it cuts your foot with its pride. The witchers moved their charmed laundry toward the shade because charms keep their temper better when not disappointed by heat. Vesper\u2019s people\u2014those who wore no color but wore all confidence\u2014carried out shrouds of wire that looked like music written down and looped them from post to post as if stringing a harp between two remarks. Liora watched them with a calm she had to construct from spare parts; each post looked like an opinion and the wires looked like the line every argument goes quiet along when both sides have said everything and the truth is still elsewhere.\n\nThey went to choose their place. It was not where Vesper had pointed, not exactly, because Liora had an animal\u2019s dislike of being placed, even by someone who meant well in her own deviant fashion. She took them three lengths to the west, where the blue stone rose into a sort of shoulder and then dipped, making a little cupped space with a view of the column through a lace of cables, and if you sat with your back to the rock you could see both the white shelf with its painted pigeons and the door where those carried by their own \u00e9lan stumbled and had to be turned gently. It felt like the spot on a hillside where a sheep looks out and decides which foolish lamb will need herding. Corin approved it at once because there were seams any honest wall would want to admit to if coaxed, and that meant he could talk to the stone without being impertinent. Elyse liked the angles because they made it easy to throw anything unwelcome downhill until it reconsidered its choices. Tern liked that there was a line of sight to the thread of the river out past the lower scree; he had a whistler\u2019s obsession with witnessing exit routes even when there was no chance of taking them. Bramble liked it because two pigeons were not painted but real, and had come to argue with their likenesses so loudly that the bell-woman had threatened to ring them without malice.\n\nThey staked their claim not with flags, which would have been vulgar, but with actions that look like ordinary accidents. Corin sat and made a circle of stones and persuaded them to stay put despite their natural inclination to roll away in the exact hour a foot needed them. Elyse set the braid in a figure-eight between two rock-lips so that anyone coming in quick would trip on their certainty and not on the rope. Tern laid his oar along the ground and spoke to it, and though it was a piece of wood made for water and not for earth, it consented to listen, because there is no river like the air when it moves in ranks. Liora knelt in the dust and drew with the foreshaft of a reed. Her hand made the gesture the willow had taught her\u2014hello and sit married together\u2014and she wrote a long line that came back to itself and did not tie a knot. A man from Vesper\u2019s side came and stood very near and watched and made a mark on a slate as if she were a creature in a tank. She looked up and held his gaze until his hand did something embarrassing with the chalk and then she smiled in the polite manner people reserve for those watching a dog swim who have never yet gotten their shoes wet. He went away with the expression of someone who would return hand in hand with an explanation later and stand exactly where he had stood before until she gave him a word he could put on a shelf in his head and dust each week.\n\nIt would have been better if the count had been shy. It would have been better if it had curled, refused to make an appearance in daylight like a drunk who knows the sun shows every lousy choice. It was instead upright and prompt and went down to five a little after the noon-bell, while men were drinking broth and women were scolding children for trying to lick the sugar-air in secret behind the white shelf\u2019s post. Tern\u2019s tin took on the ugly glamour of a mirror and everyone wanted to look and then not look and then look again. When he cupped it, he did so with both palms, and Liora found herself knuckling her mouth to keep from telling him to put it down because you never tell a man holding a thing that has chosen to be terrible to let go or he will think himself the only one allowed. The mark smeared, the hole showed, and the mountain raised its shoulders as if a story had just gotten good in the middle of something else.\n\nThe change touched the river first. It did not run backwards this time; it changed its mind about being a line. It lifted in three places like a boy\u2019s hair in a wind, and at those three places it made a sound between a laugh and a cough and then it lay back down with a shudder that made the fish jump without having meant to. A woman carrying a basket of small birds on her head\u2014an absurd thing to carry on a mountain unless you think the mountain will be hungry\u2014set the basket down in alarm and two of the birds leapt out and turned in the air as if they\u2019d been taught a new language and had to say hello at once. Children cried because any time the world performs, children cry with proprietary outrage. The bell rang. Elyse rang her own bell\u2014a piece of brass she had bought from a tinker who\u2019d sworn it had never been a cowbell in its life and had always been meant for better things\u2014and the tone folded under the Spire\u2019s note with a domestic firmness that reminded everyone within hearing of kitchens where harsh words are not spoken because they would fall into dough and make it tough.\n\nVesper appeared where people can appear if their feet know the floor. She had ink on her fingertips and something in her hair that might have been crystal powder or might have been flour if she had been very strange and had decided to bake under a column that wanted to undo all ingredients. She did not look at Liora directly, which was to her credit, and she did not look away, which was to it also. \u201cYou feel it,\u201d she said to the air between them because speaking to the precise place where a person stands is a power like stepping on their shadow and must be used rarely or you will crush those who would otherwise stand for you. \u201cThe pattern is not mine. I am not the hand. I am the tool in the hand. The old ones set it here as you set a key on a nail by the door. The planet has been trying to unlock it for years. It is patient. It is patient in the way of rot. It simply waits for the floorboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cTools choose,\u201d Liora said, and the willow hummed in agreement because wood knows the difference between a good hand and fools. \u201cYou set the Resonatory ringing. You built rooms that make people taller or make them fall. You put ladders of light up where stone used to be. Stone is a poor conversationalist and you have given it language. It is still your mouth speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what would you have me say, Princess of a lake that wishes to be a wall,\u201d Vesper asked, and now she looked full at Liora as if it would do neither of them good to pretend that this was not between them and that the mountain and the sky and the little green children were not merely audience. \u201cShall I speak the old apology. We did not know. We could not have foreseen. The consequences were unexpected. Spare me. Consequences are always the first thing to arrive and the last to be invited in. Come see the tuner again when the hour turns. We have nearly taught it a note that will let a seam weeps with grace rather than explode like anger. If you still wish to scold me, do it in front of it. It likes to hear women speak like door-frames.\u201d\n\nLiora did not go to the tuner. She had known children who learned to fold paper into little boats and then, because they were clever, could not resist setting those boats floating in puddles that belonged to other people\u2019s houses. There is never a conversation to be had with a cleverness about not setting it in the water, only about where the puddle is and whether the puddle\u2019s owner will come out and say a word that will make someone cry. She sat with her back to the rock and the willow laid along her thigh and she watched the painted pigeons with their round foolish eyes and thought of the woman with the braid telling her to leave a hair in the crack so the cliff would not steal too much. She pulled a hair and tied it around her wrist, not to keep herself from falling up, though the old witches would have laughed and told her it would do that too if she asked, but to remind herself that her hand belonged to her when she put it forward. Elyse did the same because she had always liked Precaution, a goddess of no one\u2019s pantheon who could be called simply by saying her name around a small danger.\n\nCorin had found his work among Vesper\u2019s people whether any of them liked it or not. Two of the light planks had learned to scoff and he did not stand for that sort of goings-on in load-bearing structures. He banged and murmured and stood like a post and waved a boy back from some enthusiasm and lent a woman his pencil and took from her a nail that he put politely in his mouth because he\u2019d no other pocket. The light planks stopped scoffing, which is a good first step in both carpentry and conversation. Kite took a watch without being asked and made himself a silly boy for the children on the white shelf, turning his boat upside down and putting it on his head and calling himself a turtle while the bell-woman frowned and then failed to hide her smile in her apron. Tern drifted toward any place there was a container. He had a way of looking at jars that made them behave themselves and of untying knots without moving his hands.\n\nIt came on them like weather that has sent a letter ahead of itself and then arrives precisely when it promised and still shocks because we never really believe things will happen when they say they will. The air put its teeth together and then unclenched. The tin clicked. The mark that was not a mark let go the shape of five and showed the hole shaped like less of a hand. Men made that sound they make when their finger hammers their thumb. Women made the sound that says here we are, here we are. The ground wanted to go down and up in the same breath and had to choose and resented the choice. Vesper set her palm to the blue stone and spoke in an undertone and the undertone had in it the night that comes over ash plain when all the heat of the day stands up and walks away on little legs.\n\nThe first rift opened not in the sky but in a story. A woman who had come because her sister had gone up and never sent a line home stood at the edge of their little chosen place and began to tell what she had told herself was true about her sister\u2019s reason for staying away. Halfway through it, the story tore. It did not become false; it became afraid. The words stuck together like bread dough too wet and she made a helpless motion with her mouth as if trying to spit out a thread. Liora touched the back of the woman\u2019s neck with two fingers and thought of the river-man\u2019s tin and of the willow at the dock and of the way people who have never met can sometimes teach each other not to drown. She said one word that isn\u2019t a word, the one you say when a kettle boils over and it would be tragedy to let the soup go away. The tear mended. The sister came in it\u2014that is, the shape of her came\u2014scratching her nose as if this were all irritating rather than the end of a world. The woman cried in the mean, fierce way of those who have refused to cry for six years and now are obliged. Elyse turned away and cut air with her knife because sometimes if you do not cut something the cry goes into you and lodges like a fishbone and is only taken out by pity when you don\u2019t want it there.\n\nThe second rift opened in the rope, singing. It rose out of its posts like a snake tired of being a line. The note climbed in a hurry and the boys with their blue snuff looked suddenly both eager and ashamed. The rope tried to teach the note to a flock of things with wings that were not birds but had taken notes well and meant to be helpful. The wings fluttered wrong and the note went ragged as a cough. Liora did not try hello and sit this time. She walked to the edge and held out her wrist with the hair around it. She did not touch the rope. She held the ordinary up to the extraordinary in the way of women who have placed a loaf on a table where three bad ideas have been arguing and said there. The rope laughed. There is no other word for it. It fell back onto its posts with a thud like a brother thrown onto a bed that belongs to him and remembered that it had been made to keep two things in their proper regard, not to be a bird-school.\n\nBy midafternoon everyone\u2019s patience was a little thin as old shirts get thin along the back. Bramble had acquired a troop of followers, the kind of children who attach themselves to animals with a sense for their own dignity and who develop at speed a philosophy of goodness that involves crumbs. He led them around three holes and into two that were not holes at all but places where stepping would remind you who you had been in a different year and that might or might not improve your day. He took pride in each triumph and forgot each failure like a saint who has been told not to keep score. He visited the bell-woman with a pinecone held as if it were a valuable that must be appraised. She dinged the cone with the edge of her bell, merry despite habit, and said unsuitable for purchase and put a ribbon around it so the child who had found it could go home and tell his mother he had acquired goods.\n\nThere is a limit to how many times a mountain can ask its bones to be revised before something old in it sits up on its hind legs and has its say. Toward evening when the light went less green and more the color of certain bruises on certain fruits, a fault spoke. Corin felt it before anyone else because he had his hands in the seam in the stone and he had been listening to its grievance like a priest. His mouth shaped an oath that would have been worth writing down in a book for future use and he looked up and said without raising his voice, \u201cThe shelf,\u201d and everyone who needed to hear it did. The white shelf where the pigeons had been painted had never been meant to carry any weight larger than its memory of birds. It had been gracious for two days. It had been bullied for one. It had been flattered for three hours. It made up its mind to drop its shoulders.\n\nLiora and Elyse arrived first, which is not to say faster but to say that their steps made the kind of argument the stone preferred. The pigeons\u2014those painted, those real\u2014had enemies among the children and friends among the same, and all of them would be under those condescending birds if the edge let go. The bell-woman had her pole ready and she had her bell raised, but she could not ring and hold at the same time, and her eyes told Liora that she had lived a life of ringing and holding and it had made her simply tired. Tern ran into the breath of everybody\u2019s breath with his oar and set it under the lip of the shelf and put his shoulder under the oar and drew a breath down past his ribs into wherever he kept river in his body. Kite came next with the boat and a curse that had been taught to him by a man with both ears pierced twice. They shoved the boats up against the safest place of the unsafe thing because sometimes you put an impossible object between a falling rock and a little skull and the world says all right then and remembers itself long enough to not be tragedy. Corin shoved stones like old pigs until they nestled. Elyse took the braid and looped it around a stump of something that had once been iron and now thought itself a plant and made a figure-eight so quick her fingers blurred, and then she turned and looked at Liora with all the expectation of someone who knows where her own work ends and has eagerly forgotten where yours begins.\n\nIt is a terrible power and a terrible risk to be a person whose trick is reminding. Liora put her palm flat to the pigeons because she could not catch the shelf as it was. She could only catch what it had been. She thought of the painter who had stood there on a day that wasn\u2019t this one and made little dabs with a brush and considered whether pigeons might look better if their necks had too much shine, and she thought of the person before the painter who had cut the ledge, not with grand plans for worship but to have a place to sit and put off a shoe and shake a stone into their hand. She thought of the winter when no one came, because people had had coughs, and the shelf had done what shelves do when no one sees them: experienced itself with small satisfaction at not being a path. She thought of the rock under that rock and the muscle of mountain that had been made before names and that had never been told to behave in a room. She said to it, not in any tongue: you are a thing that holds. She let her breath out very slowly so that the breath could be the rope when ropes lie. Elyse\u2019s braid bit. Tern\u2019s shoulder groaned and did not move. Kite\u2019s boat made a stayed sound that boats make when they do the job of houses and resent it secretly. The shelf jerked and then sat, sulky as a child told to sit behind a line until the game says run. The pigeons looked offended and then, being pigeons, adjusted. The children came down from the sugar with their mouths closed in that specific satisfaction of the rescued annoyed by their own gratitude. The bell-woman put down her bell long enough to press the heel of her hand to Liora\u2019s cheek with a mother\u2019s attention that took the sore spot there between thumb and forefinger and rubbed it as if it belonged to her. \u201cSoup,\u201d she said, because some words are spells.\n\nThey went back to their place under the scarp with their whole bodies shaking like metal that has been struck, and Liora did what she can do in such moments: she made a list. She thought it in the order her mother would approve. People saved. Where they will sleep tonight. Knives not put away where they should be. Bells that will need new clappers. Stones to be thanked whether or not anyone else thinks it proper. Dogs to be praised beyond what the occasion merits so that later you can be stern without offense. She spoke the list aloud only to the willow and to the seeds under the dirt near her knee, because seedlings are the oldest audience and never gossip. Bramble put his chin on her ankle and wriggled until his eye was looking straight up her skirt in that unthinking doggish way that ought to have been a scandal and only made her laugh in a little frightened stutter that let something out of her throat she had not known she was holding.\n\nAt dusk the tuner sang. There was no other way to think of it. Its note, which had been an engineering, became a voice, and the voice did not belong to any person. It was clean the way a knife is clean when someone else has sharpened it too much. Vesper stood with her back to the room where the column stood. She let the note touch the front of her like rain, and her mouth quirked as if the rain had guessed a secret and there was sport in being found out. The count slid with the unfunny grace of a spoon through stew and became four. The breath went out of a hundred chests at once and back in, and on the exhale the mountain burped, with all the embarrassment of something so old doing something so undignified. Far under them, maybe under the black roots of the Black Spire itself, something in the rock went loose and turned, and the sound it made was like someone\u2019s grandmother clicking her tongue against her teeth at a bad joke told to a child.\n\nIn the half-light between then and full night a woman came up the path with a bundle wrapped in a coat. She was thin in the way of people who have eaten all the good things and then given them away, and her mouth had taken to making lines that were not expressions, just evidence of weather. She came straight to Liora because that is the problem with becoming a subject in a story that is being told before it is finished; people know where to find you. She put the bundle on the ground and opened the coat and there was a baby in it who had seen three hours of the changed green and had come to the conclusion it would sleep through it if no one objected. It breathed with authority. It had eyebrows that belonged to its father and a chin that belonged to the stone. \u201cHe was born when it went to four,\u201d the woman said, and it was the voice of a person who had not decided yet whether to be proud or angry that her child would have this sort of drama in his pocket for the rest of his life. \u201cTell me. Will he be all right.\u201d\n\nLiora knelt and put a finger under the baby\u2019s hand because babies are very firm in their opinions about whether your finger is a good place to rehearse holding. He gripped and released and gripped again in a rhythm that had nothing to do with the mountain and everything to do with his body\u2019s small chores. She looked at the woman and let her mouth be the place where truth is allowed to be kind. \u201cHe is born,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is the kind of all right I can promise. He will make other all rights as he goes. None of them will be as important as the first one, which is the one he has already done. If you would like him to have a name that makes it easier for him to stand when all this is done, pick one with two syllables and a sound in the middle he can bite. Names like that go well with soup.\u201d The woman laughed, because the particular sort of person who laughs at soup-jokes is exactly the sort you need on a mountain that has decided to pretend to be a story, and she wrapped her baby up and went away relieved in the peculiar way of those who have not got any certainty and have chosen to like the shape of the uncertainty they\u2019ve been handed.\n\nThe Night-Tears sprouted at moonrise. Elyse whistled under her breath the way you whistle when a horse you do not own comes near enough to decide about. They had put up two leaves apiece as neat as any apprentice\u2019s first attempt at tidy handwriting, and at the heart of each leaf a small bell budded with its mouth tight shut. Liora had not expected it so soon and felt in the sprouting the trick that Vesper loved so much she had built a city out of it: if you do something at the right place and the right minute, everything will grow up immediately and you will feel like a god. She wanted to loathe the satisfaction and could not; she accepted it like a loan she would pay back with interest in times when nothing grew and the mountain sulked, and she put her palm over the little bells and whispered, \u201cNot yet. Not until ringing would be a kindness.\u201d\n\nSleep was a matter of closing eyes and then being told by every small thing you had met that day that it would like to review its notes with you at length. Liora went under anyway, carrying her fear like a child hip-carried, not because she loved it but because putting it down would only make it cry. The dream came, of course. It came and then hesitated like an actor at the edge of a light and then stepped in because no one had signaled it not to. Vesper was not in it. The lake was. It looked like itself and then, when it breathed, it looked like a chest and then like a mouth and then like nothing but water again, which is the kind of trick that keeps people living beside it forever and calling it their friend despite all the ways it can get you killed. It said nothing. It did not have to. It did what it had done at the dock and under her ear and once when she had been very small and had put both hands to its chill in a season when putting your hands into things was the fashion. It lifted her name and set it down and she felt what she had felt in front of the pigeons. Remembering. It isn\u2019t easy to teach stone to remember because it already remembers everything. It is easier to teach people that we remember incorrectly and should not let cleverness do our forgetting for us.\n\nShe woke when voices ran along the scarp like hares and leapt into their little hollow all at once. Tern had his hand on the spear and Elyse\u2019s fingers found her knife as easily as nails find teeth. Corin sat up and his pencil rolled out of his hair where he had stowed it and Liora caught it before it fell into a crack where she would not be able to retrieve it without crying. Kite peered out from under his boat with the face of a man who has learned that boats are good roofs but poor walls. It was not an attack. It was a rumor, the kind that wears boots. A boy panting and a woman pale and a man who had tried to keep his hands clean and failed three times. \u201cIt\u2019s gone to three,\u201d the boy gasped, his chest doing all sorts of nonsense. \u201cIt took two in one and we don\u2019t think we like that and the tuner is laughing and also there\u2019s a storm from the ground up which is wrong.\u201d He bent double, hands on his knees, and made a sound suspiciously like the bell-woman\u2019s bell, which is what happens when you live under a bell for a day and then try to have a body.\n\nThe tin was colder than it had been; whether it meant anything or was simply skin making stories of its own, Tern did not speculate aloud, which is one of the ways he is better than most men. He held it under the moon and everyone saw the hole that had been four become a hole that was not and the terrible surety of three take its place. The green did not get greener; it tired. It limped to the edges of things and waited there like a candle that knows its wick is a poor one but has hopes for the tallow. The air crawled like skin on a winter-night after a rumor of lice. Liora stood and looked toward the blue room because she knew that is where every story would be pinned when it ended, and then she chose not to go there. She went to the white shelf, because that is where the children had gone to lick sugar before and would again, and she went because if Vesper wanted her in one place she would be more useful a breath away, uncounted.\n\nOn the way she met the witcher of the bees, walking as if she had always known where this path would be when she was old. The bees were with her\u2014not all, just the ones who had names that could be spoken without dignity\u2019s loss\u2014and they wrote rude words above her head in gold for the green to swear by. The witcher had a knife on her hip and a smear of something moss-colored across her mouth like a kiss from a hill. \u201cIt begins,\u201d she said, not in a grand voice or a frightened one. \u201cThe rooms that teach the sky to sing will have their say and then they will subside, because everything does. This is not about gods. This is about habit, and your Vesper has given the world an idea so strong it will go until it is exhausted, and then it will fail. We will live in the failure. It will be ugly like a house built by a man who has never owned a square. Give me your hand.\u201d\n\nLiora gave her hand because it would have been foolish not to and because she trusted her. The witcher put something on Liora\u2019s palm that looked like a button and felt like a fingertip pressed to her skin. It had warmth and a pulse, and when she closed her hand around it, it melted with a sordid intimacy that would have embarrassed her if it had not been a charm. \u201cThat\u2019s a piece of the old song as it was badly sung by a man very much in love,\u201d the witcher said. \u201cIt will remind you in a moment you cannot remember. Don\u2019t be precious about it. It is made of mistakes. Those are the best bits of anything.\u201d She looked at the willow and then at Liora and then at Elyse and Tern and Corin and Kite and Bramble, and she made that little bend of her head that made you feel like a person and not a child, and then she went on toward the place where all the people stand when they are asked to prove that they meant to mean well.\n\nThey set their feet. You cannot really say more than that about what anyone did after that, because there are hours in a story when everything becomes either one motion or a thousand, and in either case you will only insult it if you narrate. The white shelf held because it had been asked and praised and scolded all at once and did not know how to disobey all three at once. The bell-woman lost her voice and her daughters took her bell and rang not quite on the beat, which is best for waking the entranced because perfection reinforces dreams. The rope stopped being a soprano and became a baritone, and every man who had thought himself immune to the charm of music remembered his mother\u2019s hand on the back of his head, and how her ring had dug in if he tried to duck. The tuner laughed exactly once and then felt shy about it and made its note fatter, which is something fat notes sometimes do before they decide to roll over everything. Vesper\u2019s eyes shone with the happiness of someone whose experiment has proceeded like a parade, and then her eyes went sober because she too had learned something and it wasn\u2019t the thing she had meant to.\n\nAt two, the ground did a peculiar thing and carried everything two inches to the left and then put it back very gently as if to insult no one. A woman dropped a pot and it broke in two pieces so neat Corin put them back together and the seam kissed itself like an old scandal. A boy looked up and said in the voice of those who will grow up to write down lies that will save lives, \u201cI think it is trying not to hurt us,\u201d and his father said nothing because he had seen cows run in one direction when lightning strikes and the look in their eyes had not been kindness but haste. At two, Liora felt the taste of metal in the back of her mouth and bit the charm the witcher had given her and it tasted of a room with a table where a man had said sorry in a way that made apology a thing with weight and warmth, and she felt the stone under her feet approve that taste, because stone is not sentimental but it respects warmth.\n\nAt one, Vesper came and stood where the pigeons could see her. She had never cared for pigeons and did not begin now. She did not speak. She lifted both hands and then, because she was too honest with herself to be theatrical at the very instant when any gesture might be the one that would be made famous on napkins, she let them down again and put them on the blue stone as if to feel any last tremor before the place where counts become not-counts and numbers go to wherever numbers go when dismissed. Elyse took Liora\u2019s wrist and Liora took hers and Corin put his hand over both like it was a block he had set. Tern set his oar. Kite set his boat with an intimacy that made it one more thing that would be offended if it failed. Bramble stood up with his paws planted too wide because he had never enjoyed the concept of balance and had only ever excelled at presence.\n\nThe count shed its last mark like a snake sliding out of its skin. The tin cooled to nothing and then warmed, which is a trick metals have when they intend to lie to you. A wind rose not from the ground or the sky but sideways, as if a door had opened in a wall no one had thought was a door, and it smelled of rain on dirt that had not known rain for a while, and also of old oil on old hinges, and also of the inside of a sleeve where a woman had kept a letter for a day and then burned it because she had decided she liked being right more than she liked being happy. The column did not blaze; it inhaled. Everyone felt themselves be taken into a breath that was not theirs and then set back down as if the world had done a trial lift and found them heavier than they looked. The tuner sang a note no throat can hold and the rope laid itself against its posts like a hound forbidden to jump. Somewhere a child laughed, because children will laugh at weddings and funerals, which is what we have to forgive them and love them for, and Vesper closed her eyes as if to keep something from spilling out of her. Liora did not close hers. There is a sort of seeing that is only possible in ugliness, and she meant to do it.\n\nThe end, which had been rehearsing, did not occur. This is the mercy of the world. The end did not occur, but a different thing did. The Spire did not unmake the knot; it let it slip. It did not untie anything; it let it loosen. The mountains around them did not kneel; they shifted and put their weight differently on their feet. The river did not turn and run at the sky; it found a new path down and took it laughing in the dour way of rivers that have been reminded they prefer jokes to pronouncements. The green did not become black; it became a color that had never been named because there had never been a reason. It was like the inside of a leaf held to a lamp. It was like copper washed too thin. It was like old glass at the bottom of an old sea. People began to breathe wrong and then right again because that is what you do when something enormous spares you.\n\nVesper opened her eyes and looked at Liora and the look said three whole books in a sentence. Liora looked back and said four in five words without speaking any of them. The bell-woman sat down because she had rung too much and her daughters stood over her, one with a hand on her hair and one with a hand on her heart. Corin put his forehead to the stone and did not apologize because he had done his part better than that. Elyse exhaled the way women do when they have had to hold too many breaths while men finished being clever. Tern kissed the tin disc because it was the nearest piece of luck and then spit on it to take away any curse of pride. Kite put his boat on his head again because it had worked once and might again if the gods were of a practical sort, and surely some of them were. Bramble sneezed and looked startled and then pleased, which is one of the most complete reports anyone gives on any event.\n\nThe mountain, which had prepared, prepared again, because preparing is the way old things move toward change without giving away the dignity of their slowness. In the silence that came after the not-ending, Liora heard the lake. It is foolish to claim that; she knew it as she thought it. But the drum under the water that had been beating all week beat once now, here, under stone and under light, and she knew what she had always half known and refused to say because it would have meant she must act. The rooms were not rooms. The column was not a column. The count was not a count. They were arrangements. They were a choreographed remembering. Someone had taught Alderra to be a planet by singing it a song and then never sung the rest. Vesper had given it a chorus and it had hummed along as any good student will when put before a tune. It was not an ending. It was a modulation. Vesper\u2019s face, in that moment, held grief for every ending she had promised herself to love and the small surprise of relief that she might not be headmistress at the death of the world after all.\n\nIt is a great inconvenience when the apocalypse refuses to keep to schedule. Men must put their shovels down and pick them up again, and women must take off the kettle and put it back on, and everyone must learn a new way to be large or be small depending. The Spire had not undone; it had shifted the music, and in the new key many old songs could be sung and some could not and someone would have to write the ones that should. Liora sat with her back to the rock, the willow humming like a contented cat, and she thought with an irritation that tasted like gratitude that there would be time, now, for all the wrong arguments and some of the right ones. Vesper seemed to feel the same and disliked it and welcomed it and looked at Liora as if to say, Now we will find out whether you prefer governance to theater.\n\nNight came honest and with a few stars that had not been present lately. They looked washed, like children\u2019s faces after the first crying. People ate what they had and then what their neighbors had and then scolded each other for not having saved. Liora wrote on a scrap and put it into a reed and pressed it into a little runnel that had more confidence today than yesterday and said, \u201cTake it home. Do not show it to the fishmonger. He will say heroish isn\u2019t a word in front of my mother and I will have to be dignified and I do not prefer it.\u201d She told Tamsin the count had gone into a new shape and that she would not come down at once because a woman who has stood for an ending is required to stand for the not-ending too or else it looks like her courage belonged to someone else. She signed it in the way she had always signed such things for her mother: with a small drawing of Bramble\u2019s ear, which was the only thing she had ever been able to draw with any confidence.\n\nVesper came at last, late when late had become simply a number. She sat\u2014not on the stone, which she distrusted now because it had surprised her, but on the edge of Liora\u2019s circle of ordinary. There was dirt on her cheek again and a thread caught between two fingers because she had learned to embroider something in a spare hour once and had taken her skill with her into this foolishness. \u201cYour no,\u201d she said without preamble because manner is an affectation and not a virtue, \u201cdid not stop me. It did not even slow me. It shaped me. I dislike you for that and am grateful. Do you mean to stay long enough to make a nuisance of yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean to stay long enough to send children to bed when they should be sleeping, and to tell you when your men set a ladder of light where a ladder of wood is required, and to clap when your rooms open without killing anyone,\u201d Liora said, calm despite the way her knees ached and the way her mind wanted to gallop. \u201cI mean to talk to the lake when the mountain grows bored of me and to ask the old bee-woman for honey that remembers. I mean to be uninteresting whenever your work will try to turn me into an anecdote. I mean to watch you not end us, Vesper. I mean to watch you fail to be a hinge and succeed at being an instrument and at the end of it all I will go home and explain to my mother why I invented a new word and tell her she was right about every other thing and that will be hard and that will be good.\u201d She smiled, and this time the smile was not a weapon or a shield. It was a reasonable human happiness at having shouted at weather and not been drowned.\n\nVesper looked at the willow and at Bramble, who was asleep on his back with his paws curled like the hands of a man blessed by a priest he did not believe in, and at Elyse and Corin and Tern and Kite, who were each pretending to be asleep in the exhaustive way of tired people who will not admit it lest they be asked to get up. She lifted a hand and then put it down and made no grand gesture. \u201cVery well,\u201d she said. \u201cStand opposite. I will tell my people you are to be indulged when you scold. They will dislike you and then stop. We will make something in the shape of our argument. It will not be pretty. It may be right.\u201d She stood and went away into the green that had become a lesser thing, and if she wished that the count had been romantic and catastrophic she did not show it, and if she had never meant the end in the first place, only the music, Liora would not inquire. There would be time for dignity and for insults later. For now, there was a dog to cover with a corner of blanket because he had the constitution of a duke and slept cold, and there was a braid to hang where it would catch, and there were seeds to water with three drops and no more because three is a number seeds like.\n\nFar away, where the reeds whisper when there is news, the lake breathed a light into the black that is the color of all lakes at night. It put its head on its own shore and listened. The heartbeat came slow and sure, not the climbing drum of a countermarch but the deliberate pace of a planet teaching itself, perhaps finally, to keep time to its own idea. In the house with the ledgers, a woman with clever hands and a temper like sober music read a rolled scrap delivered in a trout\u2019s mouth and did not smile until she counted spoon, people, and cows and found them all there, and then she smiled in a way that organized the room and made the lamps steadier. In the market with its twine-tied boys, a child told another that he had seen the lake stand up and sit and this time the other believed him because some lies are only true a week later. The reeds knocked their hollow bones and were almost content to be merely reeds rather than a choir for a princess who had gone north. The night wrapped itself around the mountain with the care that old shawls provide to old shoulders. Somewhere a hawk complained about tardiness and turned into itself, and Liora slept as well as anyone does amid the invention of a new kind of day.",

                              "content": "Morning pretended it had always meant to be quiet here, and the mountain indulged it with the sort of courtesy old things extend to young moods. Men woke with backs that had learned new verbs and decided not to complain until after bread. Women shook blankets and found the green had left dust on the wool as if it had been obliged to sign its name. The camp had acquired habits overnight; ropes that had sung set their throats and only cleared them when the wind forgot its place, and the bell-woman\u2019s daughters rang on the half-breath, which turned out to be the right time for bringing people back from the edge without making them feel laughed at. The white shelf, sulky but resigned, accepted pigeons, painted and otherwise, and a boy wrote his initials in the dust and then wiped them away because some vanity deserves to be brief. Liora woke feeling as if the inside of her bones had been scrubbed with snow, which is a respectable form of tiredness, and when she sat up the willow had left a pale line on her forearm like a note written by a friend who had not wanted to wake her.\n\nCommuniques arrived the way they do when a place has become a crossroads without permission. A trout reversed his arrogance long enough to allow a reed across his back, and Shade\u2019s hand was in the loop at the top\u2014broad, tidy script that made every letter stand like a soldier. He had tied a knot the river would remember and the knot had reached Liora\u2019s fingers without a scratch. Shade said he had heard the count pretend to be finished and fail, and that he approved of the mountain\u2019s refusal to indulge theater, and that he was sending Kite\u2019s cousin not because he did not trust Kite but because there was a woman on the south bank who had begun to sell ladles with the green set into the handles and it made him feel misunderstood in a way that needed hitting with oars. He added, almost as an afterthought, that Tamsin had sent a line but he was not opening it because he liked his ears where they were and would prefer to keep them. Liora laughed aloud and then did not, because her throat had not yet forgiven last night\u2019s alarms.\n\nTamsin\u2019s letter came in a reed that had been polished by thumb and patience until it thought itself a flute. The paper inside had the smell of the ledger room\u2014ink and lemon and an argument about whether candles should be allowed within arm\u2019s reach of a window. Liora sat with Elyse and Corin and Tern and Kite with their shoulders set like a bench, and she read in a voice that had not yet re-learned frivolity. Tamsin wrote that she would accept any outcome that did not involve losing her daughter or the lake\u2019s temper, and that she preferred the sort of bravery that sets tables and makes sure someone has tied the goats, and that if Vesper tried to set the count to her name then Liora was to say aloud the phrase you are quite boring at your worst and then remain silent for two full breaths, because silence is the one thing people who admire themselves cannot resist filling. She wrote, in smaller script that tightened like a knot, that she loved Liora in a way that had ruined her for comfort and that she thought the new word heroish might be forgiven if used only to describe dogs at dinners.\n\nThey learned the life of modules and alterations the way you learn a friend\u2019s domestic habits without intending to. After the green softened, the ropes took to humming when anyone tried to put a lie through them; a man told his companion he would be back by sundown even though he had no intention of being less than three days and the rope above his head made a noise like a tired aunt. Night-Tears budded and held their mouths shut with decorum until the first liar came to sit on Liora\u2019s stone and boast. He wore the green like a scarf and had the satisfied slump of men who have tried to die elegantly and been thwarted; he said he had gone up for children, and two buds rang so purely that even the pigeons put their heads under their wings in embarrassment. The man went red to his collar and then, to his credit, said, \u201cAll right. I went up because I have never been tall enough in any room and I wished to be taller,\" and one of the buds let out a small chiming that was not approval so much as a mitigation. Elyse looked at the little bells with the fond grimness of a woman who keeps a drawer of labels for jars and does not usually need them; she pressed a fingertip to one bud and it settled as if it had been patted.\n\nVesper sent a messenger with hair cropped too short to tie back and a mouth that had been taught to keep statements where they belong. The message said, politely, that another room would be opened by noon, and that those who had opinions about rooms were welcome to hold them close and then come and lay them out in an orderly fashion afterward. The new room, she had written with that airy cruelty Liora could not help admiring, was called the Archive of Weathered Names, which had once been a library and then been a cupboard and then a rumor and had lately been a wall. \u201cIt will allow,\u201d the messenger read without inflection, \u201cadjustments to the burden of seasons on places that have been badly served by habit. We will try it on the Fell-Flats by dusk. Bring your objections and your bells.\u201d The messenger held the last line in the air just long enough to be scolded by her own ears and then went away before anyone could decide to object at her personally.\n\nCorin, who had found in Vesper\u2019s people a tribe with whom to argue about weight and shame, went to look at the gutters cut for the Archive with that look of his that makes stone confide. He came back carrying dust on his shoulders like a new coat and told Liora that the room was more cupboard than library, and that it did not love names so much as it loved cataloguing what is left after names have been worn thin. \u201cIt will be useful until it remembers being hurt,\u201d he said, and made tea with the seriousness he reserved for nails set in the wrong grain. Elyse sat on her heels and shaved down the braid Shade had sent until its pride was less obvious to the eye, and while she worked she told a story about the last time a woman tried to adjust seasons with her hands and forgot she would have to hold the new ones steady when they arrived. \u201cPeople like beginnings,\u201d she said, tugging a knot into obedience. \u201cNobody likes standing in the doorway three years later and shooing out the drafts.\u201d\n\nThe witcher came with her bees at midmorning and set a jar on their stone with the solemnity of treaties. The honey inside had become the precise color of the green when it lay down into the valley and pretended it had not been elsewhere; when you tilted the jar, light moved through it like a fish remembering its river. \u201cFor when you need to tell the truth and want it to keep its hair combed,\u201d she said, and then, because she was unkind in exactly the right way, she looked over Liora\u2019s shoulder at the Archive and added, \u201cAnd for when Vesper tries to prettify a thing and forgets to admit she has, which is not the same as lying but is hungry for the same food.\u201d She drew a line with her boot on the ground and bees followed and went into the line one at a time, humming in numbers that pinned the ears. \u201cYou will appear in their story,\u201d she told Liora without any comfort in it. \u201cBe someone they must speak carefully about or they will say ridiculous things just to hear themselves.\u201d\n\nShade himself arrived before noon with reeds in his hair because he had promised and because he liked to keep to the letter when the spirit tried to get clever with him. He had one hand on the shoulder of a woman who had been a river-knight longer than any of the boys had been alive, and in the other hand a bundle of oars so clean you could have used them to teach a child the shape of a straight line. He greeted Kite with mockery that made a home of his mouth and then embraced Tern like a man who is thankful in quantities small enough to be spoken but large enough to be seen. \u201cI hear heroes,\u201d he said to Liora so quietly it was nearly a courtesy, \u201cand I prefer bread. If I am required to lift anything that is not a boat I will protest. I have brought with me four men who will not listen to women unless you put a fish in your hair, which is a failing of their childhood, not their souls, and three women who cannot stand Vesper in person and adore her at a distance, which makes them very useful in a crisis. Where would you like me to lay the oars so that they will be in the way of anyone who comes running cleverly.\u201d\n\nLiora pointed him toward the path that had acquired a habit of becoming a ribbon when no one watched it, and he arranged the oars across it with the artistry of a patient man making mischief. Tamsin would have liked him, Liora thought; they were of a species that had learned to prefer the friction of decency to the smoothness of adoration. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d the hawk announced from a post where no hawk had perched while anyone was looking, and then, seeing that nobody would be impressed by its tardy wit, turned itself into a puff of memory and left Corin coated in a fine layer of inconvenience. \u201cI dislike that bird,\u201d Elyse said, sneezing delicately and pinning her braid to the rock, and Shade grinned as if the hawk had been sent precisely to test whether they were taking themselves too seriously.\n\nThe Archive did not open so much as consent to have its lids removed. It smelled like rain and laundry and old paper that has tired of telling its story. Inside, names lay in drawers like folded shirts that had not been worn since the family got rich and then poor again. Vesper\u2019s people moved among the cabinets with the attentiveness of pickpockets and the ethics of librarians; they pulled out trays and did not sniff and did not propose improvements, and this restraint made Liora inclined to like them in ways that irritated her. Vesper stood with her hands behind her because she could not be trusted with them around an unclaimed instrument. She turned enough toward Liora that Liora felt included and not enough that she felt claimed, and Liora appreciated the courtesy as one appreciates a door held open on a day when you intend to argue past it.\n\n\u201cWe will try the Fell-Flats,\u201d Vesper said, tone uninflected and therefore dangerous. \u201cThree hamlets sit in the wind\u2019s lashed lip, and this year their grain will try to set in cold and fail. We will edge the seasons and see if the grain will accept a different invitation.\u201d She looked at Corin, because he had spoken against her seam the day before and she had learned the value in being warned by the man who disapproved. \u201cIf we are wrong, we will be wrong in a way we can stop. If we are right, I will take down a mountain of medals I have been granted in the last month by men who think we are in a war and have mistaken engineering for victory.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk like that within earshot of medals,\u201d Elyse said, sliding the braid into a place that would prevent anyone from becoming pleased with themselves and therefore injured. \u201cThey tarnish on purpose when they feel unappreciated.\u201d Vesper\u2019s mouth did the not-smile again, small and unguarded enough that Liora had to look away to keep from liking it.\n\nThey did not go to the Fell-Flats. It was, Liora argued, one thing to move the burden of a season on a page and another to move it on a woman standing in a field with cramp in both hands. \u201cIf you\u2019ve a trick to play,\u201d she said, with that careful politeness Tamsin had advised in her letter, \u201cplay it on a place that remembers it was empty. If the Archive is honest, it can edge frost on stone. Then we can count to three. We can make soup. We can do it once more with courage.\u201d Vesper considered the alternative with visible impatience and then, because she had somewhere learned the difference between concession and insult, she nodded and flicked her eyes toward the masons. \u201cFind me a corner that will not break anyone\u2019s heart if it goes wrong,\u201d she said, and three men ran as if she had said their names in the tone of payment.\n\nThe corner turned out to be a shelf of basalt that had, in some other life, been a river bed and now was a memory of water and a home to small stubborn plants. The Archive hummed at it as if reminding a child how to sit. A woman ran her hands along a drawer labeled Frost\u2013Unmarried and drew out a ribbon of something white that was not cloth and not light; when she put it to the stone, the stone pretended to be morning in a month it had not meant to see. For a moment it was too much like theater and Liora felt her temper climb as if it had been invited to perform; then the stone sighed in that way of old things finding a position they can maintain without resentment, and the frost settled into a filigree that looked like the veining on certain sweet loaves. Corin crouched, put his knuckle to it, and came up with a touch of ice that did not bite but did not flatter either. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve done it, you can do it again,\u201d he said, half warning and half benediction. \u201cThat is the problem and the gift.\u201d\n\nThey all felt it when the Archive looked at the Fell-Flats as a child looks at the cakes laid out of reach on a high shelf. It wanted to show off. Vesper\u2019s jaw moved, the small muscle that lives along the ear speaking to the parts of the body that do not listen otherwise, and she did not permit it. Liora did not applaud because withholding applause is sometimes the only respect worth offering. She allowed herself the mean little glee of observing Vesper behave like a governor rather than a virtuoso, and hated the glee because it did no one any good.\n\nDisappointment, like mildew, has to be looked for or it finds you first. In the camp at the far edge where the banners loved color more than they loved anything with bones, a group had taken to calling themselves the Lusters, because there are always people ready to make a club out of their weather. They had been saving their stares for the count\u2019s last breath and had been cheated of a tidy apocalypse, and now they were inclined to push the new work until something broke with a satisfying sound. Elyse came back from fetching water with her braids disordered and her expression cleaner than usual by virtue of irritation. \u201cThey are clever in the old way,\u201d she reported, a verdict she did not hand out lightly. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a girl who can make light sulk and they\u2019ve told her everyone will be grateful when she finally makes an honest mess. If we don\u2019t keep an eye on them they\u2019ll break the tuner and then write poems about it.\u201d\n\nKite went to sit in their path with his boat on his lap and the air of a man who would be delighted to be told to move and equally delighted to refuse. Shade took up a position near the rope because men who like to untie knots can be relied upon to recognize people tying them for sport. Tern found the bell-woman\u2019s smaller bell and stood with it like a man who could ring if told without having to be asked twice. Liora went the other way because Tamsin had written in smaller script, do not stand always where you are needed or they will mistake you for furniture. She went to the place where the Night-Tears had put up their second leaves and she whispered to them about patience and then laughed at herself for the kind of person who whispers to bells in seed-form.\n\nIt was Corin who found the writing under the Spire. He cared for vents and seams the way some men care for the backs of children\u2019s knees, and when Vesper\u2019s people needed someone to go into a slot cut by the old ones with very little regard for human ribs, he was the one who would fit and whose pride would not take offense. He came back hours later with dust in his hair and his wrist scratched where a tool had forgotten its manners, and a look in his eye that Liora had last seen when he had found an old line of mortared stone where a garden shed had claimed to be the eldest thing on a property. \u201cThey left jokes,\u201d he said, dazed and delighted. \u201cScratched in where no one could see them unless they were being insulted by the fit of the place. This one\u201d\u2014and he drew with his finger in the air\u2014\u201cis a little note that says do not stand under this unless you are better than a god at guessing. This one says my sister married an idea and they never had children. This one is a sketch of a pigeon relieving itself on the head of a man wearing a crown and the crown is shaped exactly like this.\u201d He pointed to the lip of the column where it forgot itself and Liora felt the human of the old builders reach up like a weed and take her by the ankle and insist that she remember all grand rooms are built by people who made faces while they worked.\n\nBy afternoon the Lusters had tried to make a spectacle and had been given soup instead. Kite had told them a story about the time he and Shade had rowed a mile backwards by mistake because the river had been insulted and then had to pretend they had intended it, and somehow in the telling the urge to break the tuner curdled into a cranky desire to be admired for not breaking it. Elyse passed around a batch of curses she had written in a neat hand and told them they could keep them for domestic use if they promised to insult only tea, not systems. Tern rang the little bell when any sentence grew so elegant it forgot about sense. Liora wrote a line in the dust that said we will not lift what we cannot set down without apology and left it there until someone\u2019s foot removed it because feet are the honest grooms of pride.\n\nVesper came to Liora not because she wanted to but because leaders speak to the person who has arranged to be an obstacle without being rude. She sat this time as she had before, on the outer rim of Liora\u2019s circle of ordinary, and her eyes did that glitter that belongs to people who have overachieved in their disdain for themselves and are trying to decide whether a compliment might help. \u201cI wanted it,\u201d she said without preface, because the day had knocked pleasantry out of her mouth. \u201cI wanted a clean end, a good story, a beautiful last note, and I have been given this instead, which is work, and scheduling, and the particular fatigue of knowing the better thing will be to get up tomorrow and get up again after that. You can make fun of me now if you like. I deserve it, though I warn you I may enjoy it.\u201d\n\nLiora considered the delights of unkindness and let most of them go because she was, alas, improving with practice. \u201cI will save it for an hour when I am tired and you are arrogant,\u201d she said, which earned her a proper smile and the raising of a shoulder that suggested Vesper had wanted to be forgiven and was angry to find that forgiveness had no glamour. \u201cTell me why you hate doves,\u201d she added, because small questions won where all the large ones make enemies, and Vesper blinked and then, absurdly, told her.\n\nHer father had bred them as a hobby, it seemed, and had given them all names that could be whistled and then had forgotten them and whistled names at random. Half the birds had starved because they were waiting to be called to supper by a song their throats did not recognize, and Vesper had taken that into her bones as one takes into one\u2019s throat a slice of an orange eaten at the exact wrong hour. \u201cI dislike creatures that require a performance to eat,\u201d she said, harsh and precise with the old grievance, and Liora recognized the ragged place where a childhood sometimes puts its teeth and felt distaste at her own complicity in admiring Vesper\u2019s wound. \u201cI will not be a dove,\u201d Vesper said, low, and then the mountain gave a little shrug like a man settling his jacket and the Archive rustled its drawers as if to say there are worse things to be than named and fed.\n\nThe hawk, having failed to properly land on Corin\u2019s head earlier, found a new way to insist on its presence: it spoke from the side of a rock where any other bird would have chosen to be quiet. \u201cYou will be late to everything you love if you make yourself stay here,\u201d it told Liora with the shamelessness of a creature that has never kept a ledger. \u201cYou will be early to your own death if you go everywhere anyone asks you to go. Choose the rudeness you prefer.\u201d Elyse threw her a look that said do not dignify a hawk, and Liora laughed because the advice was useful and because she was becoming more and more the sort of person who used laughter to keep from setting anything on fire.\n\nLate, at the hour when even children who are fascinated by the idea of standing awake under a painted pigeon become heavy as bread in arms, the rope\u2019s song changed and then corrected itself, and six people looked up at once with the same expression: the old one, the witcher, two masons, Liora, and Vesper. It was not an alarm; it was an inclusion. The rope had learned a second part to the tuner\u2019s line and was suggesting a harmony. Vesper looked almost frightened, which is an interesting expression on a face that prefers to be the person frightening others. \u201cIt will do this now,\u201d she said, quietly to herself and not quietly enough that Liora did not hear. \u201cThe work will go on where it is not pointed. The rooms will learn to talk to one another when I am not in the room. How unbearable, to have made something willing to proceed without my applause.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow bearable,\u201d Liora said, thinking of Tamsin in her room with soft lamps and the meticulous comfort of put-away spoons, and thinking of men with oars who measured the world by their arms and did not try to tell the river what it was, and thinking of Bramble, who had at last found the exact place between Elyse and Corin where his heat kept both their ankles warm and had fallen into sleep as sincere as any vow. \u201cTo know you are no longer the hinge. To be something useful like a shelf instead.\u201d Vesper made a terrible face and then agreed with the part of herself that had learned, at last, that the better insult is the one you keep.\n\nThat night the Night-Tears opened their mouths and did not ring because they had learned taste in their hours closed. They showed their pale throats to the green\u2014no longer the insistence of a plan but the lament of a habit\u2014and then filled with dew and held it like pearls. Liora touched one with the back of her finger and thought of Tamsin\u2019s letter and wrote one back, not with reed and trout but with the ordinary vigor of a pen on paper and the knowledge that rivers would not mind being denied a small errand. She said that she had stood at the place where endings are supposed to occur and had been offered instead the very long work of mending a world that had been taught to think it could be better after it broke, and that she had said yes to the mending because there are only two kinds of people in such stories and she had decided to be the kind named afterward for braids or for sensible shoes rather than for plummets or for glory. She wrote that she would come home as long as she could, as often as she could, as soon as she felt she had left a mark anyone could find their way by in her absence, and that she had invented another word and it was not heroish; it was worksome. She thought her mother might forgive this.\n\nIn the hours before dawn, when the mountain tells itself the fables it keeps for grandchildren, something padded past their circle that made Bramble sit up without barking. He lifted his head, sniffed, considered whether to make a fuss, and then, decisively, thumped his tail twice. Liora knew better than to ask him to translate; he had been bred for presence, not for exegesis. In the gray that followed, a woman came into view with a stick in her hand and a baby strapped to her chest and half a loaf under her arm. She had the soft-ankled stride of those who do not know they are being watched by history. \u201cWe came up for the end,\u201d she said to no one as if apologizing to a fence. \u201cWe will stay for the middle. Does anyone need a stitch put in a sleeve.\u201d She sat without being asked and threaded her needle with floss that had been dyed with onion skins, and Liora found herself stupidly grateful in the way you are when a world has not ended and someone offers to fix shirt cuffs.\n\nWhen the sun decided to report for duty, the Fell-Flats sent a message by smoke. It did not say gratitude; it said we had frost and did not, and the second part of the sentence had been written by a twelve-year-old with a reckless love for grammar. Vesper saw it and did not pretend indifference, and she did not betray herself by speaking more than the room required. Liora saw her take the news into that place where she carried the story of the doves and the underfed; she saw her rearrange her contempt into usefulness. She stood and stretched and glanced toward the blue room with all the old hunger in her face and then glanced toward the white shelf with a new attention that would not let the sugar-likers stand without a bell. \u201cCome be my argument,\u201d she said to Liora, dry as a piece of toast that would still be the best thing you ate all day. \u201cWe will open another room. We will close two. We will tell the rope it is not a choir unless it receives a medal from the bell-woman. We will make a policy about pigeons. We will write it down. We will be contemptibly alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorksome,\u201d Liora agreed, because she had found a word and meant to make it pull. She stood into the day with the willow singing a little because it had learned, like the rest of them, that there was more to be done than singing, and that songs might have to be used like tools and tools like prayers and prayers like bells rung not for endings but to get people to come and eat. The hawk\u2019s shadow went by without comment. The rope held its line. The Archive adjusted its drawers hopefully and was told plainly to wait its turn. Bramble trotted ahead to ask the path what sort of foolishness it planned before breakfast, and the path, out of affection, tried to behave. They started for the door with the light planks and did not step on the places that liked to be looked at more than walked upon, and behind them the Night-Tears held their dew and decided to ring later for something that would need ringing more than any of this.",
