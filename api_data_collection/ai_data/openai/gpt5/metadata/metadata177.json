     "novel_text": "The first body lay where the river bullied the bank, where kudzu tangled the signposts and whispering stacked itself between the train cars that had been abandoned so long they were part of the landscape. Dawn hadn\u2019t gotten its act together yet, just a wash of thin blue leaking from the lip of the sky. The men in canvas jackets were yawning around their coffee cups, steam rising\u2014exhaust from tired lungs. Flashers clicked in yellow, pooling light on rocks and riprap and the slick slopes where runoff gathered secrets.\n\nShe saw the color before she saw the face.\n\nTurquoise. Not hospital-blue, not the blotchy sky-blue that cheap denim fades into, not the watery color of a swim pool long after summer has left town. Turquoise, the way a stone looks on a woman\u2019s throat when she doesn\u2019t care who\u2019s watching her; old mountains crushed to powder and sealed in resin.\n\n\u201cDetective,\u201d someone said, moving their mouth around chewing gum. She didn\u2019t look to see who. She already knew the way the vowels sounded when her name came off strangers: Dodge, like a thing thrown at you. She walked down the slope, her boots making a sound like rain on cardboard. She had to lean, catch herself on a root; the Tennessee had been eating away at the bank again, wild and patient, the way grief gnaws.\n\nHe lay with his head against the concrete step someone had poured and forgot, and it didn\u2019t seem right, the way his neck couldn\u2019t decide which way to become slack. His hair had taken the paint like a bird\u2019s nest dipped in stormwater. Turquoise spread across his cheekbones and throat, across his chest in drips and with odd deliberation: places left bare like they were holding their breath. It shone when the light hit it. His eyes were open, and the whites were white, startling, not washed out by paint, so that he seemed to be witnessing his own painted body and could do nothing to argue. The paint had dried in beads along his lashes. No blood to speak of, no fight. The cold had done its job neat. He had been placed, not dropped. Whoever had done this had an aesthetic.\n\n\u201cMorning, Dodge,\u201d said Quinn, coffee cup in both hands, a scarf wound to his chin. He had pale cereal eyes, spooned and forgetful. \u201cWe got the call at four eighteen. Jogger called it in. We got\u2014well. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing,\u201d she said softly.\n\nThe jogger was standing near the cruiser, hugging himself like his upper arms had promised something and backed out. He\u2019d talked to Patrol already. He would talk again. He would say that it had looked like a statue at first. He would say he had seen art museums in bigger cities and this had the same hush except for the river keep saying hey hey hey against the rocks. He would say he hadn\u2019t thought to touch the boy. He had never seen that color on skin before.\n\nDodge knelt. Her knee hit frozen earth. It bit up through denim. She had done worse things with her knees. She had let them grind into gravel under the belly of a truck in Fallujah while she stuffed a torn-up tourniquet into a man\u2019s thigh and said you\u2019re okay you\u2019re okay you\u2019re okay, while the noon sun squatted like a jealous god. She didn\u2019t want to think of that here, not with the smell of latex and river and cheap coffee. She breathed like an instrument being tuned. She looked for fingerprints in the paint, for brush marks, for the pressure of a hand that had pressed this man back to stillness. There were brush marks, yes, precise, as though whoever had painted him had paused and turned the brush in their fingers to make the edges clean. As though he had been painted for an audience. As though being dead was a medium.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch,\u201d Quinn said reflexively. He knew she wouldn\u2019t. She looked anyway.\n\nAn index card was tucked under the boy\u2019s backside, as neat as a love note under a dorm pillow. Quinn had the sense to point with his eye rather than his hand. Dodge nodded. She put on her gloves. The paint didn\u2019t smear when she nudged his hip enough to free the edge of the card. It had adhered. He was heavy with it. This is how paint works; it makes things heavier. Her father had painted houses until his lungs filled with grit. She knew the smell of thinner the way some people know the smell of a good red sauce, and this had that, plus something camphor-bright, almost clean.\n\nThe card read: HE SAID MAYBE.\n\nQuinn said nothing, because they were new enough to each other that he still let her name the bones of things before he did. They had been thrown together three weeks ago with a pair of stupid smiles from higher-ups who liked the way their resumes matched like a bad blind date. You like guns? She likes guns. You like not sleeping? She likes not sleeping. You both look like you keep secrets like spare keys under your tongue.\n\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d she asked the corpse, softly enough it might have been to herself. The wind answered. It kept worrying the weeds. The sun stuck one shoulder over the treeline and stopped there, cocky or shy, she couldn\u2019t tell.\n\n\u201cWallet says Daniel Payne,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cTwenty-one. Vandy student. Wallet was left. Cash gone. Or he didn\u2019t have cash. Phone not present. No obvious contusions. We\u2019ll know more once\u2026 you know.\u201d He flicked his eyes at the ME van.\n\nShe waited for the memory. It arrived like a dog that doesn\u2019t come when called but when it feels like it, damp and defiant. He said maybe. He. The killer\u2014or the not-killer\u2014needed there to be a he. The paint insisted on it, in the way it illumined places that young men show to each other in locker rooms, the way it made exposed skin into an exhibit. He said maybe, and the color was chosen to match the feeling of being told that you are almost good enough but not quite, that you are the backup dancer for your own life.\n\n\u201cTurquoise,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPaint sample?\u201d Quinn said, as though asking her to dance. \u201cWe\u2019ll pull chips. See if there\u2019s an identifiable brand. You think the paint\u2019s meaningful or\u2014\u201d\n\nShe looked at him, not unkindly. \u201cYou think the paint isn\u2019t meaningful?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cI mean. Maybe it\u2019s what was in the closet. Maybe his mom does shabby-chic.\u201d\n\nShe looked at the way the paint had been applied to the wrists, like cuffs. The way the mouth was only half-coated, as if the brush had hesitated where lips become impossibly tender. \u201cHe chose this color. He practiced this color.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know him already,\u201d Quinn said, level, not accusing.\n\nShe did. In the way you know someone in a dream. In the way you know the silhouette that shows up when you close your eyes after a day of staring too hard. She sometimes saw him walking in front of her headlights at night, or standing on the meridian holding a bouquet made of receipts. She had given him a face once, just to make him stop knocking on the inside of her skull. But the face kept changing: sharp cheekbones and then none; eyes that electrician-blue and then muddy as river water. The one constant was the sound he made when he was looked at: the hiss of a match, the little laugh of someone who had been told no so often he had started to wear it like a coat.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d Quinn asked.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said maybe. You think there\u2019ll be a he who shows up. A\u2026 Nicolas? Doesn\u2019t every predator like to pick a silly name?\u201d\n\nShe did not flinch. But the name hit the inside of her like heat lightning. Nicolas. It arrived with the soft weight of a glove dropped on tile. Why had her brain kept that one? Because it was common enough to hide in plain sight. Because when you said it fast it became Ni-clos, and closeness was a joke people tell themselves to go to sleep.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not calling him anything yet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He took a swallow of coffee and winced like the taste had turned. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d been called a soldier when she returned to Nashville, and then a detective, and both labels fit like a jacket you steal from someone you love and wear anyway, sleeves too long, shoulders a joke. She was built for standing still with her hand on a holster, for listening to the middle note in a lie. She had learned in the Army to make the world small: your squad, your sector, the radius you can see without turning. In the city, the world wants to do the opposite. It wants to widen until you can\u2019t perceive the edges. You think you are smart enough to hold all that in your head and then you dream of deserts when it\u2019s raining and you wake with grit in your teeth.\n\nBy the time they zipped Daniel Payne into a bag, the color had dried completely. The plastic rasped across it. There were little flecks on the concrete. A tech collected them with tweezer-slow care. She would get to sit in front of a microscope later and watch the world turn into flecks. It would be a comfort, how small and definite they could make things with a lens.\n\nOn the drive back, she took the long way\u2014a loop onto the Jefferson Street bridge, the ramp curling up and around like a snake that had forgotten its own tail. The city tossed its light back in her face, buildings glancing like teeth. Banners over the minor league stadium still flapped with last season\u2019s lies. Somewhere a siren laughed itself silly. She rolled her shoulders against the seat like she was making room for a ghost.\n\nAt her desk someone had left a file folder with a Post-it stuck like an accusation. Payne, Daniel. There were three pages in it she hadn\u2019t put there yet: a driver\u2019s license printout from the DMV that made him look fourteen; a campus ID photo where he tried too hard to look older\u2014jaw jutted, hair ironed into obedience\u2014and failed; an email printout from a professor that simply said, He missed class yesterday. Possible extension for midterm? The professor had probably attached a syllabus. Because that\u2019s how adults apologize to each other: with PDFs.\n\nShe read the pages like prayers, knowing they would not answer and still hoping they would.\n\nThe receptionist dropped a package on her desk. Sturdy cardboard, taped and re-taped, address block printed in the tidy font of an old typewriter: Metropolitan Nashville Police Department: Detective Dodge. No return label, only a smear of something blue-green on the seam like a fingerprint from a child who has been allowed to play with his mother\u2019s eyeshadow for the first time.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe receptionist shrugged. \u201cGuy in a cap. Didn\u2019t look at me. Left it on the chair by the elevators and skedaddled. You want me to call\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStay,\u201d she said, and picked up the box.\n\nAn intern hovered like a dragonfly wanting water. Quinn arrived as if conjured. \u201cYou want to bomb-squad that?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou want to go get coffee,\u201d she said, steady. \u201cAnd bring it back. And then you want to sit exactly there and not talk for five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that.\u201d\n\nShe let herself listen to the sound of tape releasing as she picked at the edge. It was too neat to rip. It let go with a softness that made her throat feel strange. Inside the first layer was another box. Inside the second, a nest of paper shreds\u2014magazines cut up for confetti. She sifted. The pieces bled ink on her gloves. Her fingers found the bottom of the box and touched fabric. She lifted.\n\nA shirt, folded, used but washed until the cotton had given up remembering its own shape. Vandy colors, with a smear of turquoise at the hem like a carelessly wiped brush. She unfolded it. Someone had written in permanent marker along the inside of the collar: DANIEL P. Nice handwriting. The kind you teach yourself when you are bored in summer school, when your teacher is trying not to notice that you are practicing loops instead of listening to state capitals.\n\nThere was a note, only it wasn\u2019t paper. It was a paint chip from a hardware store, the kind that lets you hold future walls between finger and thumb. The names printed on it were ridiculous lies: Morning Lagoon, Tidepool Smile, Glassy Sky. One rectangle of color had a circle drawn around it in pen. The circle was not quite even, as if the hand had been shaking or laughing. Next to it a word: Sorry.\n\nQuinn returned and set the coffee on her desk as if he\u2019d walked in on someone sleeping. He leaned over. She showed him the shirt, the paint card.\n\n\u201cSon of a\u2014\u201d he breathed. \u201cHow did he get that? From the victim? What does sorry mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe one of those paint colors just took it too personally,\u201d she said.\n\nHe almost smiled, but then his mouth folded shut. He knew better, even this early, than to let her get away with jokes. \u201cThis is him. The guy. You think this is him?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. The name wanted to be said. It sat on her tongue like a lozenge, cooling everything. She swallowed it back into herself.\n\nShe had been a soldier once, and the Army taught that names mattered. You called the terrain by what it would do to you. You called the wind by the sand it pushed into your ears. You called your fear by something that would make sense to a sergeant you could not disappoint, like Mama or Whiskey. A man like this one, if he was a man, wanted a name because the name would put a handle on him. It would make it easier to drag him out of the river of everyone else.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go see Daniel Payne\u2019s roommates,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was late morning by the time campus let them in. Lawns sleeping under frost, squirrels not buying any of it. The dorm was an attempt at hospitality sponsored by the cold. Posters clung to cinderblock walls announcing a rally, a poetry reading, a job fair. Every face on every poster looked like it would apologize for something they hadn\u2019t done yet. A boy with glasses and a straggly mustache opened the door to Daniel\u2019s suite and immediately stepped back as if the cops had muscle memory from busting frat parties. He smelled like cheap ramen and laundry detergent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Colin,\u201d he said. He was not good at deciding where to put his hands. \u201cDanny\u2019s\u2026 I mean. Daniel. His friend. I mean, I was going to ask about him, but they sent an email that said someone would come and\u2014 Is he?.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho else is home?\u201d Dodge asked.\n\n\u201cJae\u2019s in class. Tye\u2019s sleeping. He\u2019ll pretend he\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThe room was tidy enough for boys. A plant someone definitely forgot to water had invented a new geometry to live by. The kitchen sink looked ashamed. In Daniel\u2019s room the bed was unmade in a way that suggested a quick exit, clothes heaped in the chair with a deliberateness that didn\u2019t match the bed. Posters: a band Dodge didn\u2019t recognize, a city skyline from a place he probably had never been. A strip of turquoise paint on a paper plate on the desk made her breath stutter. It was dried into a rubbery bend. Stuck to it was a blonde hair. She bagged it.\n\n\u201cDid he\u2026 was he in a relationship?\u201d she asked. The questions were always banal, and they were always not banal. \u201cDid he say he was seeing someone? Anybody leave a note, show up, call late, send too many texts? Anyone he fought with? Anyone he wanted to impress?\u201d\n\nColin pushed his glasses up in a way that made his whole face seem to wish it could be elsewhere. \u201cHe was\u2026 private, I guess. But also he really cared what people thought? I don\u2019t know. He was in this group project. He said the TA kept\u2014you know what, never mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe TA kept what?\u201d Quinn asked affably. He made himself soft on purpose, the way some people make themselves taller by wearing boots.\n\n\u201cKept, like, not answering him. He\u2019d email and email and only get a \u2018maybe\u2019 back. That\u2019s stupid. I don\u2019t know why I said it. It just\u2014he had a thing about phrasing. Like if someone said \u2018maybe\u2019 he\u2019d read it as \u2018no.\u2019 But because it was a \u2018maybe\u2019 he\u2019d try harder. Is this helping? My tongue does this thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour tongue is doing fine,\u201d Dodge said. \u201cTell me about the last time you saw him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came in at midnight. He was on the phone. He was really quiet, which is how I know something was up because Danny could be quiet like he was going to war with himself, but this was like\u2014control. He washed his hands for forever. Then he changed his shirt and took the one he\u2019d been wearing and put it in the trash? I took it out. It wasn\u2019t like, gross-gross. It had paint on it. I was like, art project? He said yeah, sure. He didn\u2019t want to talk. He never puts stuff in the trash, though. He folds. He always folds. You know what I mean? Some people fold. His mom made him fold. He told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat color?\u201d Quinn asked.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Colin blinked.\n\n\u201cThe paint.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Blue? Not like a normal blue, though. That one that used to be on the nail polish my sister wore when she wanted to make my parents mad. You know?\u201d\n\nDodge nodded as if he had told her something useful about bridges. \u201cTurquoise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call that teal, where I\u2019m from,\u201d Colin said bravely, as though the color had insulted him personally. \u201cBut, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he ever talk about a Nicolas?\u201d she said, and the room gave itself a small hiccup, like something on the stove boiling for one second when it shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Colin said too fast. \u201cI don\u2019t know a Nicolas. Should I know a Nicolas? Should\u2026 um. Should I call someone? His mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing that,\u201d she said, and then wished she had lies that were kinder. She glanced at the tiny calendar pinned to Daniel\u2019s wall. Every square full of abbreviations, test/test/test written in different pens like voices. On the day before today, a meeting circled: Skye at 8. The circle wasn\u2019t even. It wobbled as if drawn in a moving car.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Skye?\u201d Quinn said.\n\nColin\u2019s mustache shifted with his mouth\u2019s uncertainty. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He had lots of\u2026 friends. He\u2019d meet people in weird places. Like that art store on Fifth. He liked walking there when he wanted to think.\u201d\n\nDodge knew the art store. The bell above the door sounded like a toy train panicking. The woman behind the counter had a hawk\u2019s patience and hair the color of a fresh bruise. She looked at the badge then at Dodge\u2019s face and asked if she was getting enough sleep. It was a reasonable question.\n\n\u201cDo you sell this?\u201d Dodge asked, sliding the pain chip across the counter.\n\nThe woman laughed. \u201cI have at least six brands with that shade and they all pretend they invented it. Men come in and ask me for it when Christmas is hard. Women buy it when they are leaving someone and want the walls to not take it personally. We do two-for-one on student Tuesdays. Your boy been in here lately?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich boy?\u201d Dodge asked, letting the words settle.\n\n\u201cThe kind of boy who looks like he keeps getting told he\u2019s almost there. It sits on their faces. Like a hand. They buy turquoise and charcoal pencils and say \u2018the small ones, the cheap ones.\u2019 I tell them paper is paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the record, how do you know he\u2019s a boy?\u201d Quinn asked, smiling his soft smile. \u201cAll kinds of folks get told \u2018almost.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d the woman said, and she did not apologize. She reached under the counter. \u201cWe keep a tab sometimes for kids who don\u2019t have cards. We\u2019re not supposed to, so don\u2019t go making me heroic. I\u2019ll check the names.\u201d She pulled a spiral-bound notebook so tortured by the back pocket it had been living in that the metal coil bowed like a wrong instrument, pages crinkled. She licked her finger and flipped. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cPayne. And\u2014hey. He wrote other names sometimes, like he was testing how letters feel. This one\u2014Nick? Nic? That was two days ago. He bought a cheap brush. He asked me what color would look good on bruises.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you said\u2014,\u201d Dodge said, feeling the cold step into her elbows and set up a chair.\n\n\u201cI told him that\u2019s a nasty question and I said peach because I wanted to see his face, and he laughed and didn\u2019t buy peach and then asked for the exact opposite of peach. He wanted to know which whites are warm, which whites are cold. He bought fixative, which is a dumb waste of money when you still breathe money. He said he was going to make something no one could miss.\u201d\n\nThey walked out with a receipt in a plastic sleeve, the small triumph of black numbers on crinkly paper. The street looked like it had been drawn with a blunt pencil. People looked like they had been drawn with a trembling hand. Dodge shifted her shoulder blades inside her coat like she could get free of something that had learned to hold her without hands.\n\n\u201cYou said his name,\u201d Quinn said on the sidewalk. \u201cBack there. You asked about Nicolas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked about a name,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNot just any name,\u201d he said gently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about names,\u201d she said, and it came out the way you say I\u2019m not drunk when you absolutely are.\n\nWhen the day burned down to an ugly afternoon, they sat and watched the evidence do its slow trick. The lab would take longer. The lab was always a cathedral where nothing godlike happened quickly. She ate a sandwich with no taste and pretended to be human. She heard Davenport in the next cubicle practice the sentence he would say to Daniel\u2019s mother and then heard him delete it and practice a different one. If you listen you can eavesdrop on the way men try to make grief easier. They fail, and they keep trying. It\u2019s not nothing.\n\nHer phone lit. Unknown number. \u201cDetective Dodge,\u201d she said.\n\nA breath. Men have different ways of owning silence. This one breathed like he had been running and then stopped because he\u2019d seen something incredible and shouldn\u2019t share it with anyone. He was older than she\u2019d thought he would be and younger, which is another way of saying the voice didn\u2019t match the picture she didn\u2019t admit she had.\n\n\u201cI tried to be decent,\u201d he said. No hello. No I\u2019m the one. \u201cI tried to be kind about it. That\u2019s what they always say. You should be kind when you leave someone. You should be kind when you say maybe. That\u2019s the trick, right? Say maybe and they will beg you to let them give you something you didn\u2019t ask for. It\u2019s like magic but it makes your tongue dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNicolas,\u201d she said, because she was a person with a mouth and a lifetime of uses for it.\n\n\u201cIs that me now,\u201d he said, and there was a smile the size of someone you don\u2019t want to meet in any light. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a smile. It was the feeling of having your chair pulled out from under you by a charming person who said sorry and then filmed you falling, for friends. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Names are coats. I can wear whatever you want.\u201d\n\nShe let the phone record the silence for a second. Quinn was watching her. He was making himself into furniture. She put the call on speaker and set the phone on the desk like a bowl of milk someone wants the cats to find. \u201cDo you want to talk about Daniel Payne?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYou mean Danny,\u201d he said, and the way he said it made her hate his tongue for a second. \u201cHe was handsome in the way boys are when they\u2019re about to forget what to do with their beauty. He wanted me to see him. It\u2019s a nice thing. Being seen. You know?\u201d\n\nDodge stared at the paint card on her desk. The circle around Glassy Sky. Sorry. \u201cYou know he\u2019s dead,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s dramatic,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s colored. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s his phone?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder a bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cNext to a bottle with flowers in it. You will like how pretty it looks before you hate it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me see your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you think I\u2019ve earned that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s always the ways of detectives on TV. \u2018Let me look in your eyes and I\u2019ll decide if you get to be human.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be human. You\u2019ll ruin it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\nHe considered, and when he laughed it had nothing to do with humor and all to do with the sound people make when they remember a prank they pulled on someone gullible. \u201cI want him to remember. I want them all to remember how a maybe is a no with nicer shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you maybe?\u201d\n\nHe breathed. She heard something clatter lightly on his end of the line, like a brush against a jar. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a system to this. I don\u2019t just pick. I want to fix something. Rejection\u2019s an art form in this town. You\u2019re all so polite it hurts. So I decided color would be polite too, and then\u2014then no one gets to pretend they didn\u2019t see. Listen, soldier. Are you listening?\u201d\n\nHe had said soldier. It landed clean. She could feel the grit in her teeth again. The ribbon of river. Her squad leader telling her to open her mouth and breathe when the smoke got greedy. She swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you a map,\u201d he said, and the call went dead.\n\nIt came a minute later on her email, from an address that looked like a prank. A screenshot of a pinned map. The little red drop near a public art installation by the pedestrian bridge, the kind with welded bicycles and declarations nobody reads. Quinn looked at her. She looked back. \u201cYou\u2019re making a face like you\u2019re about to sprint,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do not sprint,\u201d she said.\n\nThey went anyway, because there is a point beyond which caution becomes a kind of fraud. The afternoon had tired of trying to be cold and simply was. People moved briskly as if they could outpace a feeling. Under the bridge a bottle sat upright, as promised, flowers in it\u2014that stiff grocery-store kind that lasts forever because the water dies around them, wrapped in light blue tissue paper that had been ripped just so. Someone had stuck the bottle into a crack in the concrete. Someone had thought about angles. Next to it, a phone face-down.\n\nQuinn approached with a stick, playful because people watch, and then solemn because they don\u2019t. He flipped it. The screen was black. Dodge reached with her gloved hand. On the back, painted with care, a little circle in turquoise. The paint had bitten into the case.\n\n\u201cIs it a trap?\u201d Quinn asked. He wanted to say it. He wanted to be right about one simple thing. The word trap implies intelligence you can wrestle with. Sometimes the thing that gets you isn\u2019t a trap; it\u2019s gravity.\n\n\u201cEverything is a trap,\u201d she said to the wind, to the river, to the problem inside her own head. She put the phone in a bag.\n\nThat night she did not go home. She made deals with herself the way children bargain with dark rooms. If I finish this report, I can close my eyes in my chair for seven minutes. If I don\u2019t think the name, other bad things won\u2019t happen. She thought the name anyway, and not once, twice, a hundred\u2014Nicolas\u2014so that by the time the clock said three, it didn\u2019t look like a word anymore. It looked like a mouth open and shut.\n\nShe had wanted once to have something other than work to go home to. She had tried. The way some people try to read complicated novels. She could do it and then she couldn\u2019t. When a man said maybe she didn\u2019t know how to leave him his word, she wanted to pure push him toward one thing, yes or no. The Army had taught her the neat trick of living with a plan and a backup plan and a map in your leg. Nashville had taught her that maps are suggestions at best, at worst lies told by a printer trying to be useful. In between was the man on the phone and his paint and the way he had said soldier like he had been there, like the smell of burning oil was just a memory of a candle.\n\nAround four, when the office had gone to that hollow quiet that leaves even the coffee looking pinched, she went to the bathroom and stared at herself. Skewed ponytail. Lips like she\u2019d been biting them, which she had. The mirror had a chip at the bottom where someone had set it down too hard years ago. It held onto the missing piece like a grudge. She washed her hands, not because they were dirty but because she wanted the sting of water. When she looked down she saw it: a smear of turquoise at her wrist, right where people wear watches when they want to be on time for their own excuses.\n\nShe didn\u2019t remember touching paint. She scrubbed. It didn\u2019t come off immediately. She rubbed until her skin complained and then it peeled, reluctantly, leaving a doubt behind. She could not tell if she was washing the color away or a bruise of coincidence.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Quinn said softly. He had come to the doorway without knocking. \u201cI think I found where the phone\u2019s been. There\u2019s a bus stop camera. Do you want to\u2014 You okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeach,\u201d she said.\n\nHe blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She dried her wrist thoroughly, the way you do when you want to lie to a wound.\n\nThey watched the footage in a room that smelled like cheap carpet and old gum. A man in a gray hoodie had put the phone under the bridge. He was careful. He\u2019s always careful, she thought. He is somewhere between tall and not tall. He wore a cap, yes. He had the slump of someone who\u2019d lost something early and kept trying to stand up straighter but could only do it when no one was looking. He looked, in other words, like everyone. He had put the phone down, the bottle, stepped back, stood and watched his offering to the god of incidental passerby, as if he wanted witness. Then he vanished at the edge of the frame, like he belonged to the part of the world that cameras can\u2019t sing.\n\n\u201cFreeze it,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cCan we enhance, make him taller?\u201d\n\nShe laughed, and the sound came out like someone else\u2019s shoe. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to enhance reality, Quinn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure? Because that sounds like a nice trick.\u201d\n\nIn the quiet before morning she called her mother. It went to voicemail. Her mother kept the same message she\u2019d recorded ten years ago, the one that made her voice sound like a tin can tied to a back bumper. Hi it\u2019s Lorene. Leave it clean. Dodge listened to the sound of who she had been when she was too young to be anyone and then hung up without speaking. Sometimes not saying what you feel is a kindness. Sometimes it\u2019s simply not knowing which words will combust.\n\nShe fell asleep in the chair. She dreamed of the paint aisle at the hardware store, the little cards like stamps, like whale-tails, like all the ways a person could live if they could just decide. Nicolas pushed a cart past her, wheels squealing like they had opinions. He wore a shirt with someone else\u2019s name on it. He stopped and took a card and swallowed it. He took another and tucked it in her sleeve. He did not look at her face but at her wrists. He said, in the dream, sorry, as if teaching a child a magic word. She woke with her fist clenched and the name in her mouth like candy she hadn\u2019t meant to steal.\n\nWhen the morning nametag changed on the city, when the sun pretended to be new, the lab sent a tiny miracle: a match to a brand of art paint more expensive than a student would choose, more specific than a house painter would bother with. They sent the formula, the pigment concentrations, the fancy word ethereal that the company insisted on in its catalog copy. A list of retailers. The one on Fifth. A whisper of a paint seller online who would ship no questions asked, wrapped like contraband, in boxes meant for books.\n\nThe ME had more to say now that Daniel\u2019s body had had one more night of listening to the cold. Unremarkable contusions on the back of the head, consistent with a shove, a fall, not with a rage. No obvious asphyxiation but a suggestion. A shade of suggestion, as if life had been invited to leave with kind fingers, not yanked out with fury. No sexual assault. Paint entered cracks of skin, papercuts, a hangnail. The brush used had been a narrow flat, synthetic fibers. Green-blue residue at the base of the nail of his right thumb. He had been held by someone who knew how to hold.\n\nThey were learning not much and everything. They were learning style. They were learning patience. They were learning that this person would make a choreograph of his crimes, at least the part after the part that mattered\u2014the part that left someone no longer an actor in the scene of themselves\u2014so that he could have one pure thing: the delight of arranging, of watching the city be forced to admit to color.\n\nDodge drove at noon, because she couldn\u2019t not. The art store again. The hardware store on the bad side of pretty where the old men sucked their teeth and told the cashiers how they would do it if they were in charge. She bought a small bottle of the color. She put it on the passenger seat and buckled it in. She drove to the river and sat where the first body had been, only now the ground had been washed by men who scrub for a living, and the weeds had grown arrogant in one night in that way weeds do\u2014their life is a shout.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to see,\u201d she asked no one, and someone answered in the shape of a shadow cast by her own head across the rock, the way it made a little theater. She closed her eyes and saw a turquoise ribbon pulled through a ring the way sailors show knots to children. She saw the knuckles of a man flexing as he paints around a nipple with decency, like he was letting the body keep its small secrets. She saw a word written on the inside of her skull in handwriting too clean and that word was maybe.\n\nHer phone rang. The voice was calm and had been waiting for her. \u201cYou\u2019re so close to falling in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou keep standing at the edge like that. One little push, and you\u2019re swimming. Do you like it. The color.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gaudy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s amateur hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cNecessary,\u201d he said. \u201cNecessary is not always pretty. Ask a surgeon.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to imagine him in this city as she spoke. She wanted to tilt her head and see in the corner of her eye a man on a bench pretending to be about to cry. She wanted the cage of him solid. But the voice was coming from the part of the day no one owns, and her head hurt with the way the river stood its ground.\n\n\u201cWho is Skye,\u201d she asked.\n\nHe said nothing for the count of three Mississippi. \u201cSkye,\u201d he said, tasting it, like he was learning to pronounce a friend\u2019s name in a foreign language. \u201cSkye matters. Skye tells the weather how to behave. He\u2014no. She. See what language does? She gave me a word once and I folded it up and put it in my mouth and sucked on it until it disappeared. It tasted like copper.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou killed Daniel,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLanguage again,\u201d he said, and the smile was back, sweet and dumb and arrogant. \u201cI made him stop. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhere you always are, soldier. Under bridges. On the edge of things. Breathing hard so you can hear yourself exist. It won\u2019t help you. I am everywhere that \u2018maybe\u2019 lives. It\u2019s a gorgeous country. We have mountains.\u201d\n\nThe line dropped. It had never been a line. It had been a piece of string a child uses to make a cat\u2019s cradle, and then hands that drop it, and then laughter that says it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nBack at the office the walls seemed an inch closer than they had last week. The plant on the windowsill had resurrected in her absence, which meant someone else had watered it, which meant kindness could be anonymous and not demand repayment, which meant she could stand it again for five minutes. Quinn sat with his feet not quite touching the floor, a grown man trying to make himself smaller out of respect, or fear, or because he\u2019d learned from someone that women give more truth when you don\u2019t loom.\n\n\u201cYou think Daniel paints,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPainted,\u201d she corrected without kindness. \u201cYes. No. He let himself be painted. That\u2019s different.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think the killer is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he knows how to make a brush\u2019s edge look like it didn\u2019t get there by accident,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see the pores on his shoulder where the paint pooled? He went slow. He was not angry. Rage doesn\u2019t go slow. He thought he was doing a service. He thinks he has a point, Quinn, which is worse than the other kind. And he\u2014\u201d She stopped because there it was again, the smear on her wrist, ghost of a color she\u2019d washed away. She had not put her hands in the paint. She had not leaned against the bag where the phone was sleeping. She had not\u2014\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Quinn asked.\n\n\u201cI need a shower,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d he said.\n\nShe went to the locker room and leaned against tile and let the water slap at her shoulders until she felt scraped and honest. She put her forehead against the cool wall. She thought about the way she used to stand in showers on bases a half-world away, the way the pipes rattled like old men in a church basement, the way the water smelled brackish and clean at the same time. She thought about the boy\u2019s eyelashes with beads of paint on them. She thought about the smile in the man\u2019s voice and the way it made him seem like someone she\u2019d known in a line, waiting for a signature, the way boredom makes friends out of strangers. She thought about a story she had told herself about being competent, and how competence was a coat that eventually smells like smoke.\n\nWhen she stepped out, a towel around her, her phone was buzzing on the bench. A text from an unknown number. A picture. Her car, parked by the river where she had sat. On the hood, a single handprint. Turquoise. The fingers long. The thumb set a little far from the rest, like a man who had learned to use tools with his left hand because someone had insisted that right was right.\n\nShe did not call Quinn. She stood with the towel and let herself not think for the space of three breaths. Then she pulled on clothes with the efficiency of a person who learned young how to be ready faster than someone could yell orders. She walked to her car and the handprint was exactly where the picture had said it would be, and the paint was wet.\n\nThe river said hey hey hey and the wind said nothing and she put her hand, just for a second, almost in the place where his had been, and she told herself not to, and she did anyway. She lifted her fingers. The color held. She rubbed it with her thumb. It gave off a smell that made her mouth flood, like something candied and chemical, like holidays that happen in houses where you know better than to go.\n\nShe went home finally, because even detective work is a kind of endocrine system that can only pump so long without recalibrating. She fed the cat that had adopted her after someone left town, a fat orange politician with the name Plank. She stood at the sink and let the tap run cool as if she could drain her head that way, let the city\u2019s pipes hum to her, the voice of a thing that exists only to keep people from noticing what it does. The news was on because she didn\u2019t turn it off. They were talking about a sculpture downtown with a new coat of paint, a prank, teenagers probably. The sculpture had been painted the wrong color, the anchor chains made ocean where they should be iron. The camera loved the guy in a beanie who said art is for everyone. The camera didn\u2019t love the fact that the anchor chain looked like a bracelet on the city\u2019s wrist.\n\nShe slept. She dreamed a harmless dream about breakfast. She woke with her mouth full of the taste of copper and a word she didn\u2019t speak even in the empty room.\n\nIn the morning, before the sky had decided what to be, she drove to a field where they used to run drills, zigzag cones yelling at you usually in winter because that\u2019s when budgets remember you. She ran between them until the hate in her calves unclenched. She stopped on the far side and bent double and touched the ground because she had promised herself that whenever she forgot how to be here she would touch this, this dirt, this ugly useful earth, until it told her there were worse things than the voice of a man who thinks he has invented color.\n\nWhen she stood, he was standing by the bleachers, hands in the pockets of a coat that wished it were new and wasn\u2019t. He was neither tall nor short and his face was one of those that on some days looks like the lead boy in a school play and on others the kid who holds up a tree and says he\u2019s an actor too. He lifted one hand as if asking a question in class. He was married to the city, she thought. He had that look: people who stay after everyone else leaves and hold the door for you and then step aside and watch you go.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d she said, and the wind took her words and threw them on the ground and laughed.\n\n\u201cNeither are you,\u201d he said, and if she had closed her eyes she might have heard him without his mouth.\n\nShe took a step. He took a step back and smiled and it was not a threat, not exactly, but the same feeling you have when you see a child on a railing. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, and she wanted to slap the word off his tongue and tell it to be better than itself. \u201cI was out of paint. Thought I\u2019d come find more.\u201d He lifted his hands and she saw that they were clean. She understood suddenly and with a heat that made her skin feel too tight: the paint on her wrist, the handprint on her car, the phone under the bridge\u2014all of it like a schoolboy flicking notes, the pleasure of getting away with it.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to call you,\u201d she said because she had to keep him speaking.\n\nHe shrugged. His coat made a small sound like a page turning. \u201cNames are for later. Or never. You\u2019ll make one up anyway and then you\u2019ll put it on the news and then mothers will say it like a curse to their children. Keep your room clean or Nicolas will come in the night and color your shoes. I don\u2019t want that life.\u201d\n\n\u201cNicolas,\u201d she repeated, and it looked wrong in the air on this field. It looked like a coin you toss and it lands on its edge. \u201cWhy turquoise.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s the color of apology,\u201d he said, delighted with himself, and then his face did a thing, a small fall like someone tripping over an invisible shoelace. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the color that makes white want to be honest. Because it\u2019s halfway to green but doesn\u2019t know how to arrive. Because a girl named Skye once said it made my eyes look like I knew where I was going, and then she said maybe, and then she said not now, and then she said I\u2019m sorry, and then she said can we still be\u2014 and I told her that sorry is a ribbon you tie on a gift you were never going to give.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou killed Daniel,\u201d she said again, because the field, the cones, the way her calves had loosened\u2014it all felt like a song that has lost its words.\n\n\u201cI painted him,\u201d he said, and the last thing he said before he turned his face to the wind was almost tender. \u201cHe asked me to.\u201d\n\nHe moved. Not fast. Not the way television goes. He simply figured out where to be where she was not, and then he let distance be a magician for him. He walked behind the bleachers and was not there, and then was somewhere else, and then the wind told her she had missed the only trick. She did not pull her weapon because there was nothing to shoot that would solve falling.\n\nShe stood there and the cones looked at her like little witnesses and the sky decided on a kind of gray that would not explain itself. Her phone went off. A text. Another picture. A wall this time, a modest brick wall somewhere she did not immediately recognize, the kind that keeps weeds from forgetting themselves. Painted on it in letters careful as stitches: HE SAID MAYBE. Painted in turquoise. Underneath, in smaller hand, like a whisper: Sorry.\n\nThe city would wake and see it. It would say teenagers again. It would say art is for everyone again. It would say maybe and then it would go to work.\n\nShe walked back to the car and sat, and she held the bottle of paint she had bought in her hand like an egg, and she felt the weight of colors she didn\u2019t choose. When she turned the key, the engine made the little cough that meant maybe and then it caught and said yes, and she drove toward the wall that did not know it had become a message. In the rearview mirror, the field lay like a promise that needed more words to hold steady. Her mouth formed a name without sound and the name looked wrong and then it looked right and then it became just a shape.\n\nShe would catch him, she thought. Or she would catch herself catching him. Or she would catch the river and make it say one thing for once. She wanted something singular in a world made of maybes. She tightened her hands on the wheel and the smear of color on her wrist was gone because she had scrubbed it but not gone because nothing was gone in this city; it was merely painted over with something we could all stand to look at. She drove and did not blink because if she blinked she would have to decide what to make of the handprint and the phone and the boy and the way she had seen, in that field, a face that could be anyone\u2019s and had decided it was one person and given him a coat of the only word she had left.3\n\nThe wall wore the words like a fresh bruise no one would admit to. Morning figured itself out in increments, the light unspooling over brick and chain link and the backs of buildings that had given up on trying to be anything but backs, and people arrived the way birds do\u2014first one, then a few more, then suddenly there were too many and you couldn\u2019t identify the one that mattered. Patrol strung tape and practiced their palm-out move that kept strollers and dogs and men in fleece vests at a theatrical distance. The turquoise did its trick in this light, saturated and sugared, the letters careful, the message personal and loud enough to carry over traffic: HE SAID MAYBE. The paint hadn\u2019t dripped. Whoever had put it there had waited for the right humidity or learned patience by failing at painting enough to know when a wall will take what you give it. Below, in a quieter hand made for secrets and notes pinned under pillows: Sorry.\n\nDodge stood too close and then backed up because old brick wants to hold your skin. Her winter breath made a small ghost and that small ghost practiced hanging around and not being seen. The city had peeled itself down to the essentials overnight and put them on this spot as if it could point and say here, this, fix this part and watch everything else behave. A tech was on one knee, scooping chips that fell to her sheet of paper with the care of someone harvesting basil. The smell was fainter than by the river\u2014cold eats the smell out of paint\u2014but under it she could still hear the thinner and that chemical candy, the note from a catalog promising that if you bought enough of this you would belong to a gentler version of your life.\n\nShe let herself look at the edges. The lines weren\u2019t masked off; no tape had given them that glass-bottle crispness, which meant a steady hand and a practice wall somewhere else where the stakes were lower and his heart beat differently. The curve on the y in maybe had weight it didn\u2019t need and there was the little wishbone mistake where a left hand corrects itself in a hurry. She could see where he\u2019d held the brush up and away once, a dot of turquoise like a star, not part of the text but all of it at the same time, a painter\u2019s automatic exhale. She could see where someone had painted over old tags a hundred times and where this layer chose to ignore those ghosts. The city was a palimpsest, her father would have said if he\u2019d ever learned the word, but he hadn\u2019t and he would have just called it stubborn.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re calling it vandalism,\u201d Quinn said at her shoulder, voice made of coffee and the way his scarf liked to climb his neck, city morning in his bowl. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to say graffiti like it\u2019s a teenager with hurt feelings. You want me to do media? Or you want to make them like you for once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave I been doing it wrong,\u201d she asked, steady, and saw the corner of his mouth tilt because he knew better than to believe she didn\u2019t enjoy it when the cameras met her and then flinched and then tried again, like birds with a window they can\u2019t understand. \u201cWhat did the canvass get you.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman with a dachshund named Sergeant who swears she saw him at four forty, average build, not tall not short, cap, hoodie,\u201d he said, making those words lean on each other as if they could stand up into a man. \u201cGuy on a bike who says he slowed and asked if the city had hired someone to brighten things up. Painter didn\u2019t look up, just said it was practice. I like that one. He sounded proud of himself, like the sentence had been waiting.\u201d\n\nThe tech made a small noise\u2014not a finding, not yet, just the body being careful. Dodge crouched and planted one flat palm on her thigh to keep the world from tilting. Under the new paint the wall wore old weather, freckles of soot, the blush from a former fire that hadn\u2019t been sufficient to change the story. In the corner near the base where brick met weedy ground there was a crevice someone had offered cigarette butts to all summer. She tipped a stick in, fished something up slow. Glossed cardstock scraped with grit, the edge turquoise-stained where someone set it down careless and lifted it too soon. She held it by the corner and turned it. The card meant itself to be an appointment reminder; it had a dentist\u2019s jawline smile printed in faded ink. Across the clean side, in a hand she\u2019d seen twice now, all those loops that refused to be round, it read: SORRY LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.\n\nQuinn read it and went paler in that bowl-eyed way of his that made people hand him cookies. \u201cHe\u2019s writing to us now,\u201d he said. \u201cOr to the city. Or to himself, out loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s writing to anyone who\u2019s ever said maybe,\u201d she said, and it sounded too wide, sounded like something you can\u2019t get your arms around. She passed the card to the tech and the tech labelled it in neat block letters, the kind of handwriting that belongs to people who think one thing in their lives should stay simple.\n\nA girl with a sketchbook had got too close to the tape and then made her body smaller so that the tape looked like it had moved to accommodate her. She wore a coat three sizes too big, thrift-store wool that made a sound like a moth chewing when she shifted. Her pencil moved fast, catching the point of the y and the wrongness of the a where it leaned toward the means what is said. She had drawn Dodge without looking at her, which is a gift or a crime, depending on who receives it. Dodge walked over anyway because pencil marks sometimes catch what cameras don\u2019t. The girl did not look up; she consummated her line and then shaded the inside of sorry like she had seen a picture of an eclipse and wanted to live inside it.\n\n\u201cYou see anything,\u201d Dodge asked, gentle because college kids always think they\u2019re getting in trouble when a badge says hello.\n\nThe girl kept drawing, the pencil making a sound like dry rain. \u201cSaw a guy painting when I walked by. I thought it was for a festival. People don\u2019t get mad when it\u2019s for a festival. He had the wrong shoes for working outside. Leather that squeaked if he turned too fast, like old theater seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeft-handed,\u201d Dodge said, not exactly a question.\n\nThe girl smiled without letting it break her face open. \u201cYou saw the flourish,\u201d she said, and let the pencil make one around the y. \u201cMy professor says it\u2019s a tell when people think they\u2019re closing a circle, which is most of us. He mixed on his palm. You could tell he kept tapping the brush against his hand because he had turquoise here.\u201d She touched the heel of her hand, the pad below the little finger, and spread her fingers like a starfish. \u201cHe kept looking behind him, but not like he was scared someone would stop him. Like he was hoping they\u2019d try. He wanted to talk about it. That\u2019s a weird thing to want.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he say anything to you,\u201d Dodge asked.\n\n\u201cJust good morning, but he didn\u2019t look at me when he said it. He looked at the wall, like the wall was the one talking back,\u201d the girl said. She added a shadow down the side of the H and then, because she was kind, turned the sketchbook so Dodge could see. \u201cHe might come back, though. You know how some people are with their work. They can\u2019t leave it alone. There\u2019s this thing about symmetry. He doesn\u2019t have it. He\u2019ll want to.\u201d\n\nAfter the prints and the chips and the card got their little bags and the wall got its new life, media asked her for a sound bite big enough to put under a picture of someone\u2019s breakfast. \u201cDo you consider this a message from the perpetrator,\u201d a woman in a hat that wanted to be more important than it was asked. Dodge said it could be and could not be and that the department was pursuing all leads and thanked the citizens of Nashville for their vigilance like it was a business transaction. She smiled with all her teeth and imagined the killer at home, wherever that was, watching and grading her on her posture. You\u2019re an A when you don\u2019t blink, soldier, he would say, and then he would prefer if she failed.\n\nShe and Quinn stood with their coffee on the sidewalk when it was over and watched the city's face look at itself. \u201cSkye,\u201d he said, not looking up from the steam rising out of his cup like a mistake. \u201cIt keeps getting more gravitational. I called the registrar and played nice and they pretended they wanted to help me because they liked my phone voice. There\u2019s a Skye in Visual Arts\u2014Skye Delaney\u2014adjunct, projects on public practice, does those pop-up critique nights at a space called the Livery. Runs on donations and the fact that no one has torn it down yet. Our boy\u2019s calendar circled Skye at eight. The Livery had a session last night. That tracks. There\u2019s also a Skye in Counseling, Skye Benning, but she works eight to five and the meet-ups on her schedule are named and medicated. Which one you want to annoy first.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d she said, and touched the corner of the card in her pocket like a charm she didn\u2019t want to believe in. \u201cStart with the one he went to. The Livery. Everybody pretends nothing is urgent until a thing is. Art people are better at saying the urgent thing without moving their mouths.\u201d\n\nThe Livery was the kind of building people used to use to keep animals dry and now used to keep secrets respectable. Tall doors, paint peeling away in strips that wanted to call themselves river. Inside, the cold lived like it was paying rent. Metal folding chairs made little steel tongues of noise when you moved them and a row of clip lights tried too hard on a wire. On a table at the back were cookies turned to stone and a kettle that had learned to boil on sighs. The boards on the floor announced where anyone heavier than a thought stepped. Someone had written on the chalkboard a quote about failure and then someone else had added a longer, ruder sentence about failure\u2019s mother. Students in hats wore their insecurity like fashion. The woman who owned the room in the way you own a storm when you know the clouds by name had a head of hair bleached to that color between new page and regret and a line of tattoos up one arm that read like a sentence. Skye Delaney was older than the kids and younger than the professors, the band of the woman who has discovered where she stands and is building a deck there.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re interrupting my office hours without an office,\u201d she said when Dodge showed her the badge, and her smile made the word cop look like a different word you only use with friends. \u201cHeard about your wall. It\u2019s pretty. People will get mad it\u2019s pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaniel Payne circled you on his calendar,\u201d Dodge said. \u201cEight o\u2019clock last night.\u201d\n\nSkye\u2019s face did not fall and did not change and did what good faces do when they need to hold a thing and not drop it. She nodded like a person nods when offered a cup she didn\u2019t order. \u201cHe was here. He\u2019s been coming Wednesdays when he can. He shows up hungry for it and leaves like someone has fed him and also punched him, which is critique. He likes clarity. The problem with the word maybe is that it invites interpretation and he wants the kind of answer that has a porch light,\u201d she said, and picked up a piece of chalk and set it down again. \u201cIs he\u2014 Have you told\u2014 Is someone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling people,\u201d Quinn said carefully, looking suddenly very, very young. \u201cWe are telling his mother. We are telling you because your name is on a circle. We need to know who talked to him last. Who he talked about. He had paint on his shirt. He put it in a trash can like he doesn\u2019t do that. He went quiet when he shouldn\u2019t have. He is painted now. Do you know why.\u201d\n\nSkye\u2019s mouth made a line that could be mistaken for a horizon. \u201cHe was trying out something. He called it performance because it\u2019s safer to do the scary thing if you put a frame on it. He found someone to paint on him. He said it made him feel seen in the way naked doesn\u2019t, which, good for him. I told him to have a buddy and a safe word and to email me when he got home because I have a list of students I worry about in rotation like bedside charts. I said be careful with solvents and skin and he said he\u2019d researched. I said I don\u2019t like \u2018researched\u2019 when I can\u2019t see the footnotes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was blushing when he said it. Blushing is a good sign in boys. It means they might not hurt you. That\u2019s not science. It\u2019s fieldwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know a Nicolas,\u201d Dodge asked. She did not let her voice do anything. She kept it where it was supposed to be, on the line that meant ordinary question.\n\nSkye turned her wrist so that the tattoos along it\u2014arrows, a compass, the word boundary in a typewriter font\u2014shifted. She looked past Dodge for a second and then back, and in that second Dodge understood there were people for whom the memory of a person arrives with the weight of a stone in a pocket you forgot you put there. \u201cI knew a Nick,\u201d she said finally. \u201cIf you say Nicolas you sound like the principal. He was around here a couple of years ago when we still had a budget to pretend to be a community. That was dumb and brave. He came to critique and made everybody draw their hands without looking and then cried because he didn\u2019t know how to talk about the difference between intention and impact and I told him that was the beginning of his education. He always smelled like laundry done at someone else\u2019s house. He wanted to date the idea of me and I told him maybe because I wasn\u2019t\u2014that word. I needed to not be in anyone\u2019s project for a while. I taught him to make gesso and he taught me that some men will turn your maybe into scaffolding and climb it,\u201d she said, and leaned back against her desk, palms on wood, rings shining dull. \u201cHe showed up for a while and then he showed up less and then he stopped. He sent me a link once to a video of someone painting a body for a runway show and said this is art if fashion says it is and I wrote back and said this is art if consent says it is and he didn\u2019t write back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell Daniel that,\u201d Dodge asked. Consent like a word the room could hold. She looked at the floorboards and how they bowed with the memory of too many feet.\n\n\u201cI told Daniel everything a person can tell another person without taking the brush out of his hand,\u201d Skye said. \u201cHe was excited and also scared, which is the only honest way to make something. He said the painter liked turquoise. I told him everybody\u2019s an ocean until they have to clean the sink. He laughed. He did that thing with his face like he thinks he might be loved if he does it right. That\u2019s the face that gets me every time. I told him one day I would ban the word maybe. I say that a lot. My kids\u2014\u201d and she waved her hand at empty chairs and half-finished canvases and the silhouette of a person drawn in tape on the floor\u2014 \u201cthey are all just a chorus of maybes. It\u2019s a project city. Everything is about to be something.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Nicolas come here last night,\u201d Quinn asked. \u201cIs he part of your scene now. He likes our wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wall is a sentence,\u201d Skye said, and in the way she said it Dodge heard a tired love for the city that made excuses for itself. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t here. If he was, I would have put a chair between us so I could sit in it. Users and abusers come in looking like hungry and if you\u2019re not careful you think you can feed them. I don\u2019t feed men like that anymore,\u201d she said, and softened because she had said something hard. \u201cIf this is your man, he wears grief like a varsity jacket. He wants people to look. He learned to do that with us. Art is where you trial run your crimes. That\u2019s a shitty sentence to say out loud, but most people use it to learn how to be better humans. Some people, though, go home and cut their crime out of cardboard to see if it fits in a box.\u201d\n\nDodge took a breath that felt like lifting something heavy off a high shelf. \u201cWe\u2019ll need names. People who were here last night. Anyone who would know where Daniel went after. Anyone who would vouch. Anyone Nicolas might have used for a mirror.\u201d\n\nSkye nodded. She had a list without looking. She recited names and numbers and handles that sounded like small animals, and when she said Colin\u2019s name and then Tye\u2019s, already in Dodge\u2019s book, she added a third\u2014a Jae who folded paper cranes and told new participants to keep their hands off the glue gun like a joke. \u201cIf you talk to my kids, you talk to them like you know they deserve to be here,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019ll write a letter and put it on the radio.\u201d\n\nQuinn smiled like that actually scared him in a small way. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, and it made the room warmer. It made Skye forgive him for existing.\n\nThey left with a flurry of names and the sense that the cold had opinions. Outside the air had decided on bright and brittle. Dodge unlocked the car and paused because the sight of the handprint had been burned into the back of her eyes and memory is a lazy beast. It wasn\u2019t there now; her hood was clean save for dust and a scar in the paint from when a branch had tried to be more tree than it was. She held the picture up on her phone like a child comparing stickers to a sheet. The print sat there, five long fingers radiating from the heel, where he mixed the paint on his own skin, left hand, yes, thumb a little off because of the old injury he would tell a woman he wanted to sleep with came from shop class, a truth he told like a lie. Quinn looked at the picture and then at the hood and did a small thing with his mouth like a hinge thinking about itself.\n\n\u201cYou tell me last night,\u201d he said. He made it not a reprimand, made it a hand held out, palm up, you can put what you want in here and I won\u2019t close it on you.\n\nShe told him something like the truth. She told him she\u2019d come down to the garage and it had been there and she had bagged a swab off the edge because hope is a disease, and she told him about the text with the picture taken half a beat before she arrived as if the man had walked backward away from the car, phone up, whistling. His hand went to his pocket the way men do when they want to put something in their hands they can fix. He took it away empty.\n\n\u201cHe is in your yard,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cHe is leaving you a toy. He is not flirting with you. He is escalating. Do we want to talk about protective detail or do you want to use the word no on me right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, sharp, and then softened because he had earned better. \u201cI will not go home the same way twice. I will tell you the parts I don\u2019t want to. You will not look at me like you\u2019re sorry because I have already been looked at like that enough and it makes people do stupid things,\u201d she said, and it did something to him; it made him human and not teammate for a second, made him show the way he had been trained to put himself away.\n\nThey sent the handprint photo to the lab and Rhea, who wore her hair in a braid like a rope she could tie herself to something with, wrote back with a kissy face and a promise and the line give me two hours and your favorite donuts. They sent the wall samples and the new card and kept the receipt from the art store in its sleeve like a holy thing. The lab would pull binder and pigment ratios apart until they sang their little chemical song. The bus camera was feeding footage now, and in the blue-light room where reality goes to be argued with they watched the man in gray again, watched the way he didn\u2019t hurry and didn\u2019t slow, watched the little three-inch habit in the swing of his left arm that people get when they\u2019ve had to carry weight there too long. He put the bottle down like he was giving it a good home. He stepped back and admired his own correctness and then he was gone, into that corner of the frame where your life always walks off to if you let it.\n\n\u201cSkye Benning,\u201d Dodge said, late in the day when the body makes a liar out of your ambition, and they walked across campus to a building that wanted to be wood and was eleven kinds of plastic. Student Wellness had couches that looked like snacks and a bulletin board dressed up in emojis. The receptionist smiled with her whole face because she had been hired to. Skye Benning came to get them with the kindness of someone who spends her days practicing being a person you can tell the truth to. She was small and fortressed in a cardigan and her nametag made a low-grade noise against her lanyard. Her office had the good tissues and a plant that had been watered recently with faith. She sat without closing herself behind a desk because desks are policies wearing suits.\n\n\u201cDaniel Payne,\u201d Dodge said, and watched the woman put her hands in her lap so she wouldn\u2019t reach up and touch her own face.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d Skye Benning said. Her voice was not soft, it was exact. \u201cHe is\u2014 He was\u2014 He is a client. I say \u2018is\u2019 because what we do here exists outside of his body and in it at the same time and the tense is an argument I lose when we are done. I can\u2019t tell you what we talked about. I can tell you it was Wednesdays at eight because that is public information, the door and the logs and the fact of his feet. I can tell you he wanted to be okay and that\u2019s not a bad start,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for the inside of him,\u201d Quinn said, which was a lie, because police always ask for that without asking, they stare at the couch to see if it remembers, at the window to see if it watched. \u201cWe\u2019re asking who waited for him when he left. We\u2019re asking if anybody walked him to the door more than once. We\u2019re asking who sits out there pretending to scroll and listens through this wall. We\u2019re asking if anyone said maybe and got to turn that into a life\u2019s project.\u201d\n\nSkye Benning smiled the smile of a person who sees the whole thing and can do nothing about that. \u201cYou want to know about Nicolas,\u201d she said, and it was not a question. \u201cI have a man who likes my lobby. He likes my hours. He has discovered that if he shows up and uses the coffee machine and sits on the edge of that blue chair,\u201d she pointed, and Dodge looked and it was blue in the way dentists paint rooms, \u201cthat he can be near something soft. He does not meet with me. He insists he has no appointment. He uses a different name each week, as if he is trying them on. I tell him the chair is for clients and he says I am a client and I say not here and he says maybe and he says sorry in the way that boys say it when they think the word is a charm,\u201d she said, and the plant leaf trembled in her office as if to underline the sentence. \u201cHe came last night. Sat long enough to be counted by a building. Watched Daniel leave. I told him to get out and he left. I am tired of maybe. I am going to write a book. Do you want to arrest me for being tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat name,\u201d Dodge asked, and her pulse had discovered a drum it wanted.\n\n\u201cNick, Nico, Cole, once he tried \u2018Blue\u2019 and I laughed and he looked like a dog who doesn\u2019t get the joke,\u201d Skye said. \u201cHe is average. He is the lab-grown diamond of men. He is a salesman\u2019s son. He smells like something that used to be wealth. I can show you the camera footage of the lobby because my boss likes the feeling of control.\u201d\n\nThey watched him. The lobby camera was kinder than the bus one, closer, full of the little things people don\u2019t notice they do. He came in, cap low, hoodie, left hand scuffed with paint if you knew what to look for, the thumb bent away a fraction, soft old scar crossing the knuckle like the letter X. He poured coffee and spilled and cleaned the spill with competence like it shamed him to do it badly. He sat in the chair and looked at the door the way people look at doors when their idea of love is a hallway that keeps ending. He watched Daniel leave with his shoulders. He didn\u2019t get up. He didn\u2019t follow. A minute later he did. He stood at the lobby\u2019s edge and held himself like a fence. He waited until Daniel was down the hall and then he walked, left hand in pocket like it was the thing that needed to be hidden.\n\n\u201cTime stamp,\u201d Quinn said, because it made him feel like a man with a hammer in a world full of nails. They wrote it. They pinned it to the map of Daniel\u2019s last hour. They felt a piece slide into place and it did not make a picture yet.\n\nWhen the day got old enough to be honest, Rhea called. \u201cHandprint paint is your fancy brand,\u201d she said, cheerful as a bartender. \u201cThat specific turquoise, that same binder, micro-scratch pattern on the brush stroke that says synthetic flat, one bristle at the corner flares a little like a cowlick\u2014maybe you\u2019ll find that brush and it will be your glass slipper. More fun: latent ridge detail in the handprint. Turquoise is sticky in all the ways that matter. You\u2019ve got ridges on the distal phalanges of index and middle. They\u2019re partials but good. I can make you art out of them. You get me a suspect, I\u2019ll tell you whether his hands have been places.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re magic,\u201d Dodge said, and Rhea laughed through her nose.\n\n\u201cDonuts. Maple glaze. I like the ones with bacon. Don\u2019t name it. Don\u2019t let it name you,\u201d she said, and hung up humming.\n\nBy seven the city had chosen its night face, slick and wanting. They drove past the wall again and someone had left candles that would gutter out in the wind and that didn\u2019t matter because leaving them made a small muscle in the chest feel better. Someone had taped flowers to the brick and the brick drank the cold out of their stems. The turquoise was deeper now that the day had decided to quit. A couple in matching fleece kissed under the word maybe and took a picture and would one day look at it and call it fate. A kid in a patched jacket traced the letters with a finger he had dipped in sugar from a donut bag and left a snail trail of stick across the bottom of the b. The city was learning a new vocabulary whether it wanted to or not.\n\nAt her desk, Dodge opened Daniel\u2019s phone. Rhea had coaxed it to speak and now it sat there, a rectangle full of almosts. Texts came like a prayer wheel. Colin about ramen. A sister about sending a picture of a dog in a sweater. A mother about a box of oranges because that is how some mothers keep the world at bay. A number unlisted, not saved, bubbles in gray and blue. The last string began the day before yesterday and read like a tightrope. You said maybe, he wrote. Not no, he wrote. Maybe is hope, he wrote. The gray bubbles answered. Makes it your decision but not my fault, the gray wrote. That\u2019s the way of maybe, the gray wrote. I don\u2019t want to break anything in you, the gray wrote. The blue answered fast. You can\u2019t break anything, the blue lied. You just look and then I\u2019m better, the blue wrote. There was a picture in the string, skin and a mark in turquoise where a brush had drawn a line over a hipbone like a coastline. There was a single word after, the gray wrote: Sorry.\n\nRhea pinged an associated account for the number. It hid under a prepaid cloud and lived there like fog. But the phone in the lobby behind the Wellness Center had spit out a text at the same minute the gray bubble did and the internal logs gave them a handmade map: their man leaned against a vending machine to borrow a signal, typed out his sentence, watched it deliver and then went to see if the sorry had worked on a heart. The building gave them the story it could and then ran out of nouns. It had nothing to say about bridges or rivers or walls.\n\n\u201cI want him in a room,\u201d Quinn said, and his hand had found his gun without taking it out, the way men check their own pulse.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get him,\u201d Dodge said, and it was not hope and it was not a promise. It was something a soldier says when she has a field to cross and the field has an edge.\n\nShe drove home by streets that tried to forget her and did not. The cat yodeled his opinion at the door and then forgave her by head-butting her shin. She sat on the floor and let him step into the bowl of her lap and knead his bread on her thighs. She looked at the picture of the handprint until it dissolved and reassembled itself into a map: knuckles high, fingers long, a little scar there. She looked at her own hand and turned it palm up like the fortune-tellers in cheap tents and saw paint line remnants no one else would. Sorry looks good on you, the man had written on the card, and she wanted to put her hand through a wall in a calm, deliberate way. She wanted to say to the city stop teaching boys that apology is a costume. She wanted to get him in a room and close the door and watch his face learn about no, about single-syllable words, about the kind that stand their ground without knives.\n\nSleep came in chunks and brought her a dream about gashes of color that were fabric, not paint, ribbons tied to fenceposts where wind ran itself ragged. The ribbons said all the small words: soon, later, almost, someday, maybe, sorry, wait. She woke with the list in her mouth like beads.\n\nMorning did not bother with seduction. It barged in and told her to put on pants. She did because she is obedient in the exact ways that have kept her alive. Coffee tasted like something trying to be a solution. The news put pictures of the wall in a carousel with fall foliage and a segment on dogs that dress like people for charity. The mayor said words that wanted votes from everyone and thus meant nothing, and a councilwoman said art is conversation and the city needed more of it and Dodge didn\u2019t disagree with her, not really, she just wanted to choose the topic.\n\nOn the way in, her phone shivered. A map again. The little pin near a motel with a neon sign that had lost two letters so that it now shouted something dirty at passing traffic. A message without a greeting: You can see me if you want. He used a picture of a paint palette as his avatar. He had put a French filter on the word color like it made him more interesting.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell Quinn right away. She drove there and parked where she could see the office but not be seen. The kind of motel where towels have never forgotten who they used to be and the clerk is someone\u2019s cousin stealing time along with cigarettes and the vacuum cleaner has a limp you can hear even through walls. Men came and went like punctuation. She adjusted the rearview mirror and saw herself and the turquoise memory went through her like glass. In the office a television did that daylight talk show babble and a woman with a wig placed like a hat counted something with a clicker.\n\nHe came out like a man who leaves last, not because he had nothing else to do but because he liked being the period. Dark coat, cap, that average height that makes every witness untrustworthy. He paused, not because he felt her eyes but because men like him know how to make a moment a frame. He set his palms on the motel railing like it was a mantle piece and turned them up like he was going to show something to the cheap sky. They were clean. That was the new detail that made her mouth dry. He was cleaning himself again, purging, making innocence where paint had been. He looked down over the parking lot like a prince over his kingdom of dented cars and then walked. She let him go because she needed him to go somewhere so she could decide where to end it and not just spill her bullets across a place where women with wigs count beds.\n\nShe told Quinn after, because she had promised, and he did not scold her but his ears went a little red and that was worse. He called two cars and now their average man had an average tail. If he bought dumplings, they would know. If he went to the river, they would be there first. If he called her, she would not answer for one measured beat and make him think about what it means to wait.\n\nThe day gathered itself in the ugly way days do and they decided to go another place where the turquoise had left its breath behind. The art supply stores had given them nothing except receipts and the man\u2019s fondness for higher-end labels; the hardware store had given them a clerk's memory of a guy who asked for a discount and then had exact cash and smiled too long. They needed someone's eyes not on a payroll. They went to a barber who once cut Dodge\u2019s hair so badly she liked him for being honest. They went to a diner where the waitress had taught three generations of cops to eat eggs and not count it as a weakness. They went to a bridge and stood under it and waited for the river to get bored and tell a different story.\n\nWhen the call came, it wasn\u2019t a map. It was a sound. Screaming makes a shape in air you can draw if you have the right pencil; this was a woman\u2019s voice and a man's laughter behind it and the sound of something heavy deciding to be lighter. They made it to a vacant lot two blocks from the motel, and the lot wore its history of burned cars and prayers like a jacket. In the center, a mannequin stood on a milk crate, painted in that same turquoise, eyes drawn on with exquisite care, lashes that someone had put their tongue out to get right. Around its neck an index card hung on yarn, crooked, like a kindness performed by someone who didn\u2019t really mean it. The card said: TRY AGAIN.\n\nNeighbors stood with their arms folded and their judgment already written down. A man in a yellow cap said this city needs Jesus, and a woman whose jawline had never forgiven her for anything said this is what happens when you defund everything that matters and by everything she meant what she meant. Kids stood behind the tape and learned. The mannequin\u2019s hand was up, not in a wave, but in a posture Dodge recognized from something she couldn\u2019t place. Prayer? Theater? Surrender? She put her fingers on her own wrist and felt for paint that wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s practicing with the city now,\u201d Quinn said, and something in him went flat in a useful way. \u201cHe wants us to get good at reading him. He wants applause. He will escalate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks he is,\u201d she said, and the river air stepped into her nose and set up camp. \u201cHe thinks this is escalation. He\u2019s a coward with pretty supplies. He will misjudge the size of his own shadow and then he will not see the wall until his face is in it.\u201d\n\nShe signed the log for the mannequin like it was a person and that felt indecent and necessary. She told Rhea she was bringing it to her like a cake she didn\u2019t ask for. She took a picture of the index card and sent it to no one. She took one more of the hand, the way the thumb leaned away from the rest like a person at a party who wants to talk but can\u2019t commit. She opened her messages and there was a new note waiting like a coin in an old coat pocket. He had written: You are getting warmer. That is a sentence people put on maps and also on children.\n\nShe closed her eyes and saw the field again, those cones like small orange witnesses, the man by the bleachers, the way he\u2019d called her soldier like he had a right. She wrote back, against everything she knew, against the part of herself that wore doctrine like skin. She typed: Tell me where you learned to make a line that clean. He read it in less than a second. He took his time answering, which made her want to peel the paint off the world.\n\nHe wrote: In a house where nothing was ever left alone. My father painted rooms to keep the walls quiet. We moved a lot. He taught me to cut in without tape because tape is a weakness. If you can\u2019t make the edge clean with your hand, you\u2019re not a man. Then he wrote: Did your father teach you to hold a gun or did the Army do it because your father could not.\n\nShe saw the old man in a Yankees cap, nicotine fingers, paint on knuckles even when he swore he\u2019d washed, forearms the color of the first day of summer and a cough like winter. She saw his laugh when a drop hit the floor and her ten-year-old urge to clean it before he noticed. She saw the ladder and his two-fingered whistle when he wanted a rag and the way he made yellow behave in a kitchen that wanted to be dark. She closed her eyes and swallowed his ghost. She did not answer. You cannot give a thief a map to your house. She put her phone face down in the ashtray she didn\u2019t use and watched by not watching.\n\nNight laid a hand on the city\u2019s head and smoothed it down, again and again, as if that could make it easier to sleep. They got two dozen tips, a hundred opinions, a call from a woman who said turquoise is for boys who never grew up and then cried, a message from a man who said he had been painting fences for thirty years and he knew a clean line when he saw one and this was showroom, a pastor who wanted to pray with her on the phone and did before she could stop him, and it was not awful. They got a note from the art store woman that said your boy\u2019s credit line came through, the anonymous one I told you I shouldn\u2019t have, and the last charge was two weeks ago, and someone like a teacher had slipped some cash in the pot. They got silence where they wanted music and laughter where there should have been none.\n\nBefore midnight, when the bad part of the day puts its shoes on and goes out, Colin texted her a thing he had found in Daniel\u2019s desk, something he thought was nothing and then decided was something. He sent a picture of a folded receipt from a coffee shop near the river with a sentence written on the back in that tidy, summer-school handwriting: Skye says we practice endings so they don\u2019t surprise us. Eight, Thursday, south steps, bring proof. The date was three weeks old. The proof, she supposed, had been Daniel himself, painted and shaking and asking somebody to put a name to it. She saw him walking away from a woman under a streetlight who asked if he had water. She saw him sending a message that said sorry because somebody somewhere had told him that word is a key. She saw a man standing with a brush and the patience of a saint, placing color where it would do the most damage and telling himself he was fixing something.\n\nShe went to the south steps because the map of this city inside her needed a pin there. They were old concrete and new gum, the river loud, the bridge lights practicing being stars. She stood and put her hands in her coat pocket and leaned in that way people lean when their skeletons are tired. She thought about war and walls and the idea that the river had a spine. She thought about the way you learn to cut a line clean, no tape, no cheat, hand steady, breath even, your father watching, saying now, there, see, that\u2019s a man.\n\nFootsteps came and went and none of them were his. She stayed until cold made itself a law and then she went home by a way that had fewer corners. In her kitchen she took the little bottle of turquoise she\u2019d bought and unscrewed it and smelled it like a person committing to a mistake. She dipped a toothpick in and made a dot on a Post-it and stuck it to the inside of a cupboard door where only she would see it. She considered writing a word and she didn\u2019t. She closed the door and the dot was a consequence.\n\nAt two, when the city was practicing its sermon for Sunday, he called. His breath came in quiet and she heard the television in the background tell someone else how to feel. \u201cYou went to the steps. You\u2019re playing now,\u201d he said, pleased, like she had picked the same card as him out of a deck and he could pretend that meant something. \u201cI knew you would. You like old places. You like when the ground remembers more than you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me where you are,\u201d she said, and her voice did not shake because she had learned her voice belonged to her even when everything else didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cEven if I did, would you want to come,\u201d he asked. \u201cOr would you send the boy with the scarf and let him play at being your knight. I think you like being alone with the bad thing. It makes the good thing make sense when you get home and feed your cat. This is me being honest. Are you writing this down. Is the tape rolling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said the word soldier,\u201d she said, and she was done waiting for permission. \u201cWhat do you want me to believe about you when you say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to believe I understand,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I want you to discover I don\u2019t. That is the space I live in. That gap. That\u2019s where I build. Do you want a present. You haven\u2019t said please and I was raised by a man who thought manners were required, but I\u2019ll give it anyway because I\u2019ve had a day.\u201d He laughed softly and her scalp prickled because it sounded like a match drawn along stone. \u201cLook at your email. I found you a brush.\u201d\n\nHe hung up in that way he had, cutting you off like a bad limb. Her email chimed. A picture waited, taken in a bathroom where the mirror was old enough to hate its own job. The sink held a brush, flat, synthetic, bristles flared at one corner like a cowlick, the handle stained with a halo of turquoise and a thumbprint. The faucet leaked. The caption read: 118 Carroway. Hurry. Paint dries.\n\nShe stood so fast the chair gave a cry and then she was moving, coat, keys, gun, phone. She called Quinn and left a sentence that was a destination and a plea disguised as an instruction. She didn\u2019t use sirens. The city did not need to know. The street was two lanes holding a fight between a church and a layaway furniture store, a pawnshop that called itself a boutique and the house with the porch that had always, even before there were cops in it, looked like a place people watched from. The number was on the post in a metal font that had lost a screw and listed. She knocked and no one answered and she pushed and the door did the thing that means nobody made it their habit to lock against the ordinary.\n\nInside smelled like other people\u2019s cooking and a mop that wanted to be more than water. A light was on in the bathroom at the end of the short hall the way all tragic bathrooms live. She walked in with her body arrayed for bad news and found the brush like he promised, in the sink, bristles wet, the stain of turquoise on porcelain like a bruise. On the mirror, written backwards so it would read right when you faced it, in finger dragged through fog: MAYBE.\n\nShe stood and the tub\u2019s drip counted off seconds that weren\u2019t polite anymore. She turned the brush with a glove, looked for hair caught in the ferrule, found one navy thread and a gray eyelash and a cat hair from a cat that wasn\u2019t hers. In the hull of the sink a print had left itself like a fossil, palm and the swirl of skin, and she breathed out slow. He had given her a present he wanted her to think he regretted. He had left the thing that would say his hands had been somewhere, because this was part of the game he thought they were playing. In the hallway, a faint sound, a foot on a stair. She turned and aimed and a woman flinched into her doorway wearing a robe and fear and holding a plastic bag as if it had the answer.\n\n\u201cI rent him the front room,\u201d the woman said, and the words made a small wind in the hall. \u201cNick. He\u2019s good with cash. He says sorry when he is late. He makes the bathroom smell like a swimming pool. Is there trouble. I do not want trouble in my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always trouble in your house,\u201d Dodge said gently, and put her weapon down, point lowered, voice making a promise she could not keep. \u201cPack a bag and go to your sister\u2019s or wherever it is you go when men love you badly. We\u2019re going to take some of your things and we\u2019re going to leave you a phone number and your life is going to be loud for a while.\u201d\n\nThe woman blinked the way people blink when they don\u2019t have a habit for crying. \u201cHe painted his hair in the sink once,\u201d she said, and the sentence was a child offering a broken toy to a grown-up. \u201cHe said it made him young. He left a shirt in the dryer. You can have it because I never want to touch it again.\u201d\n\nDodge took the shirt. V-neck, cheap, spattered with tiny turquoise comets. She took the brush and the print and the heartbeat of the room. She took the image of herself in the mirror with the word maybe across her chest backwards, which felt like an orthodoxy. She took the knowledge of a street where her boots made a sound like the men down by the river, rain on cardboard. She walked out into the night that had decided to be honest with her and she let herself think, for one unkind moment, about the way his mouth had looked when he said sorry and about the way she would shut it. Then she put the thought away because that is not what good women do and also not what useful ones do. She put the address on the map. She put her finger on the place where the line had been clean. She felt the city tilt a degree toward something like gravity. Then she called Quinn again and when he answered she said the word yes like it was the first time she\u2019d gotten to all week.Quinn got there with his tie loosened and his breath fogging and the way he held his shoulders said he hadn\u2019t decided yet whether to break rules or write them down. Patrol was two minutes behind him with the tape and the posture and the clipboard that always made new places feel like they had been born guilty. The landlady watched from the threshold of her room, robe knotted like a promise she never meant to keep, the plastic bag swinging on her wrist with three potatoes and a loaf of bread inside, because hunger keeps its own schedule even when crime gets fancy. Dodge walked him through the sink, the word on the mirror, the easy door, all of it sounding simpler when you said it than it ever is when you live in it. Quinn took the brush from the glove like it was a hatchling and grinned toward the ceiling as if Rhea were already up there, spinning miracles out of bristles and binder. He asked the landlady if he could see the front room and she said it wasn\u2019t a front so much as the place where heat arrived first, and then she handed them a ring with three keys and a rabbit\u2019s foot balding from use. If you spend long enough around lethal men you start to love women like that extra, the ones who hang the calendar at the right height and count blankets with their fingers and believe in God only after lunch.\n\nThe room had been emptied with the precision of a man who had been emptied himself a long time ago and learned to like the feeling. Bed made, the hospital corners a sermon. A duffel gone. The closet a confession of nothing. What was left was the part he wanted her to find. On the windowsill a strip of painter\u2019s tape was stuck like a Band-Aid, and along it five strokes of turquoise descending from fat to fine, a practice of pressure, the kind of thing fathers make sons do in kitchens when the television is too loud to talk over. On the table a stack of paint cards stolen from the same bins in different stores, the names circled in pen with that not-quite-perfect round\u2014Glacial Tide, Pacific Ring, Poolhall Kiss, Robin Glass, January Sea\u2014and in the corner of each card, a tiny letter like a grading rubric, A or B or a single irritated C. There was no notebook, no manifesto; there were index cards, three of them, the words written as if the paper had opinion: MAYBE, SORRY, HE SAID. Under the bed a shoebox held a hand towel with stiff corners from old paint, a lighter, a Metro bus pass loaded to the edge of thoughtless convenience, three art store receipts, two for the fancy brand and one for the cheap brush that had a bristle that flared like a cowlick. In the garbage, the pale ghost of hair dye had left a blue smear where water remembers.\n\nRhea took the brush like a woman accepts a bouquet she did not want, with reverence anyway. She laid powder in the sink and teased the print like you coax a memory out of a drunk cousin at a wedding. She lifted it with tape and breathed onto the mirror to make the word become the thing it had been when the finger wrote it. She said the ridge detail on the sink was clean enough to hang a name on if the database offered generosity, and if not, she would cross her eyes and call it art and listen for a match. She bagged the painter\u2019s tape because oils rub off and men touch with the same hand they gesture with when they are proud. She let the landlady sign the bottom of the chain of custody, and when the woman asked if that made her complicit, Rhea said it made her useful, which is the better thing to be.\n\nBeneath the radiator was the only filthy corner. He had missed it, or he had left it to see if anyone would come all the way down and look. Dodge got on her knees and laid her ear to baseboard and felt the house complain into her skull. She fished with the cheap pen she always used so the nice ones would stay nice and dragged something into light, a wad of gum folded around a hair. The hair was female, long, blonde, and had a pearl clip clasped to it like a jaw. The gum was the kind that tastes like someone telling you to be optimistic, blue and sugar-free. She bagged it, and when she stood there was grit on her jeans and her knee had a complaint to file and the landlady said she told him no gum and then shrugged like boys will be boys and not men for so long it becomes a ghost story.\n\nThe cupboard over the sink had a single mug in it, white with a ring of lipstick nobody in this room had put there. He had cleaned around the lip with a kind of disgust that left everything else shining. On the sill behind the curtain a little jar of mineral spirits had been wedged into a corner like a secret, lid loose enough to talk. She tightened it with two fingers and it squealed like a mouse so small it didn\u2019t know it could die. There were no pictures. The only thing like a picture was the way the bed had been made, the way the edge turned down with a ninety-degree certainty, the way the pillow had been fluffed and then patted flat, leaving the wideslat impression of a hand that believed in rectangles.\n\nQuinn found a towel in the dryer that didn\u2019t belong to any woman with taste. It was motel thin, stamped with the name of a place that had changed hands three times this decade. A shirt fell out stuck to it like a surrender flag, cheap cotton V, small spatter of turquoise on the hem, a bite-mark from a dog at the cuff or a man with a nervous habit. He held it up and then dropped it into a bag and said the thing he always said when there was too much and not enough: okay, okay, okay. Patrol put a lock on the door that would not stop anyone worth stopping. The landlady signed another line and took the officer\u2019s card and asked if she could smoke in the kitchen now and Dodge told her to do whatever she needed to do to make the air belong to her again. The woman lit the cigarette like a prayer and looked at the word on the mirror and then closed the door to the bathroom without breathing out until she had.\n\nThe captain liked this kind of night because it made sense of the chair under him and the brass on his desk. He came down from the fourth floor to stand in the doorway of Dodge\u2019s cube while she was spreading the cards and the scores and the receipts out on a map of the city and putting yarn nowhere, because she wasn\u2019t that kind of detective and she was never going to be. He stood long enough to be counted and said they would have a press conference at ten with as few adjectives as possible, and that the mayor would say art is conversation and the department would say crime is not art. He told her to sleep and then did that thing bosses do with women they respect and fear: he asked if she needed anything and when she said no he believed her and hated that he did. Quinn fell asleep with his head on the back of his chair and his mouth open a fraction and his scarf making an untidy nest, and when he snored once, he woke himself and apologized to the ceiling like it has feelings.\n\nRhea texted at three with a photo of the lifted print from the sink and the handprint off Dodge\u2019s hood laid side by side, the ridges lined like a hymn you know in your bones, and wrote: same boy, congrats on your taste. She wrote again at four with a link to a partial hit in a database that did not belong to police and wasn\u2019t supposed to be searchable, a thumbprint from a study at the Livery where Skye Delaney had once had participants ink their hands and press them to paper to talk about labor and ownership. A man named N.H. had signed his sheet with initials and a little flourish on the H that looked exactly like the swallow of ink on the tail of the y down at the wall. It wasn\u2019t true, not yet, it wasn\u2019t enough, but it was something for the mouth to hold. Rhea wrote: tell your adjunct she runs a tidy ship, we could learn from her index cards. Dodge wrote back: I\u2019ll send donuts with bacon if you give me a name for the N.H. and Rhea sent a GIF of a woman putting on lipstick in a rearview mirror and wrote: manners, soldier.\n\nShe didn\u2019t sleep at her desk because sleep at your desk says a thing about you to the wrong person. She went home and put water on her face and it ran off her like she had waxed herself with grief. She fed the cat whose love came with terms and slept in her bed with the window open because the night needed somewhere to leave. She dreamed a dream that was part recruitment video and part art school, a drill instructor with paint on his knuckles yelling cut in, cut in, cut your line clean, no tape, the hand is your tool, the heart is a liability, and woke with the taste of chalk in her throat and the faith that whatever shadow the man cast was going to have to pass through a place she could stand.\n\nMorning in this city is always a little theatrical. The sky tries on three different lights before it commits. Dodge bought the donuts Rhea wanted and two she didn\u2019t, because sugar makes people generous with nouns. Rhea took a bacon mapleglaze and made a satisfied noise that belonged in a different room and then turned to her machines and wrote an algorithm to love what she loved. She put the brush under a microscope and they all leaned in like children at a zoo. Tiny turquoise flaked at the edges of synthetic bristle clamped in nicked metal, a fingerprint in the seal where a man with the wrong hands had put the thing together in a factory in a country that makes room for your cheap. Rhea flicked the dial and showed them a single dark hair wrapped around a bristle like a well-meaning snake, and said she would tell them what floor cleaner he used if they wanted, but also give her thirty to run the prints again through a wider net of places that would be mad if they knew she knew how to call them.\n\nThe prints came back with a story she hated for how small it was. A trespass ticket from two years ago, south Steps, no less, a cop with a pen and a headache writing N. Harlan in the line where name lives and trying to make the H look like it might be a different letter later if a lawyer said it. A loss-prevention match from a big-box home store where someone had pocketed a fancy brush on a Tuesday and then paid for something he did not need to distract the camera, a clerk writing Nicolas H., thirty-two, average, had the kind of eyes that make people tell the truth and then hate him for it, the kind of note a woman writes when she\u2019s trying not to get herself in trouble for seeing too much. A counselor note from a county intake never completed because Nick had decided to be fine and no one had insisted, the appointment marked maybe on a paper calendar, because some institutions still like to have something to erase. It wasn\u2019t enough to put cuffs on yet. It was enough to put boots on and go knock.\n\nSkye Delaney took the name like a stone in the teeth, rolled it, spit it out. She said Harlan like it meant fence and fencepost and fence that needs painting and a man who makes you hold the bucket because that means you love him. She pulled his old forms out of a folder because she keeps everything for the day she can use it to do good instead of letting it be ballast in her closet, and there it was, the smiling boy who had turned into a man with a coat everyone notices only when he takes it off. Nicolas Harlan, the Livery\u2019s waiver signed in his precise hand, the line where it said I consent to be looked at filled in once and then again, darker, like a person practicing a signature they think they will need. In the emergency contact he had written Father and then crossed it out and written No one and then written Sorry and then left it, the word an orphan on a sad line. In the back, a note in Skye\u2019s handwriting about the day he cried when she told him his work had intention but not risk, and how she had to sit with him for twenty minutes while he learned breathing again, in and out and not on the floor.\n\nSkye Benning said the name and her eyes did a little hiding act before they stood still. She said he had never used Harlan in her lobby, but it fit his mouth in the way that made you believe him when you did not want to. She said he had the habit of reading pamphlets without flipping them over, like he wanted the promise without the footnotes. She pulled the lobby footage again because she likes to be accurate, and they watched him not look at the camera again, and then look right into it once, for one frame, and there was the thing Rhea liked to find in her machines and Dodge liked to find in men, the tiny movement that gave away intent. He knew the camera, and he knew how to love himself through it.\n\nQuinn ran the name through everything he was allowed to touch and a few he wasn\u2019t. Nicolas Geoff Harlan had a father in Sumner who still kept a landline and still answered it like a man in the seventies, the voice a shape you could put a face on right away, the kind that has taught boys to cut in without tape because tape is for men who never learned their hands. He had a mother who had left when he was fourteen and then died in Florida under palm trees that made promises tourists believe, a death that had nothing to do with him and everything and the obituary had been written by a cousin who signed it with three first names. He had a GED from a place that wore a different name now. He had two W-2s spread over six years, both seasonal, both cash-lighter than they should be. He had a parking ticket at a trailhead where people go to pretend their thighs will carry them out of their own lives. He had a mobile that changed every six months and a friend named Blue so often in his contacts that it was either a joke or a failed brand.\n\nThey went to Sumner because fathers are maps whether they want to be or not. The house was not the one Dodge had expected. It was not gone to hell or kept too clean; it was clean where the eye falls and dirty where the hand does, and the hand had been distracted. The porch had fresh paint in a color the catalog had called Barn Door and the real world called Blood That Behaved. A ladder leaned in a way that had gotten narrower with years of leaning. The man who opened the door wore old muscle like a coat with someone else\u2019s name stitched into the collar. His forearms told a story about weight and repetition and the affection men take for their tools when their sons won\u2019t speak to them.\n\n\u201cHarlan,\u201d he said when she showed him the badge, like she had told him a last name he used to be proud of and now wasn\u2019t. \u201cHe\u2019s not here. He hasn\u2019t been here since the last time he wanted to tell me I didn\u2019t teach him enough and I told him to bring a wall and I\u2019d show him. What do you want me to do. Cry on the porch.\u201d\n\nDodge watched his mouth move and saw in it the way Nicolas\u2019s mouth made the word sorry look like currency. \u201cWe want to know who taught him to paint without tape,\u201d she said, and the corner of the man\u2019s eye did a grim little dance that belonged to shame and rage and a third thing, pity.\n\n\u201cI taught him to do it right. I taught him to keep the edge and clean the brush and not waste what you can\u2019t afford. I taught him to put rugs down because paint is a liar and it jumps. I taught him to take a breath at the top of a line and let your hand be the thing God made it and not the thing it becomes when you let the radio and the rent get inside it,\u201d he said, and then he took a step back and let them in as if those words had required hospitality as payment. \u201cI did not teach him to hurt nobody. He liked to be seen. He\u2019d paint a wall and then he\u2019d stand outside and stare at it longer than you had to to see if the edge was good. That\u2019s not normal. But it\u2019s not a crime. I told him normal and good aren\u2019t the same thing and he told me shut up like a man who thinks news doesn\u2019t apply to him.\u201d\n\nThe living room had the tidy shabbiness of someone who lived mostly in the shed. On the wall were two pictures that wanted to be noticed and wouldn\u2019t look at you straight on, one of a boy with a cast in eighth grade, messages scrawled in sharpie that had faded to the color of old gum, get better nick!! and you owe me $5 and a phone number someone hoped would survive the summer. The other a faded print of a farmhouse under snow from a calendar twelve years old that had been framed because the month had been good to them. The kitchen smelled like coffee done the way men who won\u2019t admit to sugar do coffee. In the doorway to the hall a strip of painter\u2019s tape had been left at a perfect right angle, and it would bother a man with this blood to see it and not peel it, so Dodge peeled it and he looked at her hand like he might like her finally.\n\n\u201cYou hit him,\u201d she said like she was talking about the weather, and the man had to take that sentence somewhere he put high on a shelf. He set his jaw like he was fitting a blade into a handle.\n\n\u201cI taught him to be a man,\u201d he said. He looked at Quinn with a glance that asked this one over here, does he still say sir to anyone, and when Quinn didn\u2019t flinch he dropped it and said: \u201cI hit what was around. It was never about him. That\u2019s a lie but it was the way I told it to myself so I could go to sleep. You going to arrest me for the nineties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to ask for a picture of him when he wasn\u2019t wearing paint,\u201d she said, and softened because the sentence said more than it needed to. He got an album from the bedroom some woman had left a long time ago and turned pages with calloused thumbs, and there was the kid, freckles before he learned to stand. There was the teenager, sideways hat before he learned fashion is a way to apologize. There was the young man with a brush held wrong in a yard where grass had done its best with bad soil. Dodge took pictures with her phone because she has learned that things vanish even in your hands.\n\n\u201cHe knows your house is honest,\u201d she said at the door, because it might give the man something to do with his day other than fold himself inside his shed. \u201cHe uses your rules when he needs rules. He\u2019s in Nashville and he\u2019s painting boys for an audience and he thinks he has an argument that will make me forgive him.\u201d\n\nThe man laughed and it sounded like a floorboard giving up. \u201cHe never learned to live with no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to have a dog and that thing, you tell it no and it would save your life. He did not have that. You all right out there. You got a face like my mother\u2019s when the hurricane was coming and the radio was too quiet.\u201d\n\nShe thanked him for his porch and took the kind of breath you take before you drive away from a childhood, left or not, and she could feel Quinn looking at her profile because he\u2019s a good partner and he knows when you need to be asked and when you don\u2019t. Her phone buzzed before the turn out of the subdivision and Rhea\u2019s name did what it always did, put energy into the part of her chest she was pretending had gone to lunch. The text said: sink print and hood print match our lobby boy and match your Livery handprint; N.H.\u2019s partial from the Livery is your man; congratulations on catching art with art; also: partial latent on paint card from wall matches same, so he doesn\u2019t wear gloves when he\u2019s proud. I\u2019m printing you a poster.\n\nBy noon the story had grown a head and three tails. The wall had its own hashtag and the city had a thinkpiece and a man with a podcast had called the turquoise the hue of modern alienation as if melancholy could be Pantone, and a mother group had written an open letter about boys and consent and paint and the way apology gets taught like a virtue. The captain\u2019s press conference did the thing it needed, and anchored somewhere below it, the fact: the department was seeking a person of interest, Nicolas Geoff Harlan, thirty-two, average height, left-handed, old scar on the left thumb, associated with the Nashville arts community and the Vanderbilt campus, last seen near the pedestrian bridge downtown. He\u2019d be live by the six o\u2019clock, and by three a woman in Antioch called and said he once tried to sell her a painting in a parking lot and had apologized when she said she didn\u2019t have cash in a way that made her feel like she\u2019d stolen something. She had kept the card he wrote his number on because she kept everything and the number didn\u2019t work anymore, but the loop on the y was a swallow, and Rhea pulled it into her nest and made it sing the same song as the others.\n\nThey went back to the Livery with a copy of the BOLO and the way the room went silent was a kindness. Skye stood with her arms full of herself like a person who knows which way she\u2019s falling already but is going to pretend she can reconsider. She looked at the picture from the father\u2019s album and let the boy turn into the man in front of her and bit her lip like she had been caught being wrong by a younger version of herself. She said she had a bench she let students build on and when they carved their names underneath, sometimes they carved other people\u2019s names too, and she took them to the bench and flipped it and there was N.H. and there was the year and a little turquoise dot next to it like a seal. She gave Dodge a box with the sign-in sheets from those months and there, three weeks back, under Daniel Payne\u2019s attempt at a signature that looked like he wanted to be taken seriously, was a line that had to be him, thin letters, precise, written with a pen that had gotten caught on the downstrokes, and next to it, in the place where kids write @names so they can find each other later, he had written: @maybeisyes. It didn\u2019t exist anymore, the handle had been closed, but that was enough for Quinn to make a list of places it would have cached itself, for Rhea to click holes in a thing that had tried to be a shield.\n\nWhen the lab got the shirt from the dryer under better light, they found a smear on the inside hem, the color not turquoise but the quiet pink of skin after someone presses too hard with anything. It could be Daniel. It could be anybody. They cut it out like a small wound and sent it to the place where DNA gets told to talk faster, and the woman there said she would call them by morning like she always does and she would probably be right sooner because she never sleeps when the city is playing at art.\n\nThe text came at four, not a map this time but a script. He sent her a picture of a room painted half in a turquoise that hurt a little if you stared, masking tape along the edge because he thought it would annoy her, the tape not even sticky because men like him don\u2019t notice when old tape gives up. He wrote: Do you like it with tape. Tell me yes or no. He wrote: I have a place tonight. He wrote: You will come because you understand me. That last sentence made a curl of laughter rise up from something feral inside her, and she let it out in the car where no one else would be asked to keep it.\n\nShe wrote back a sentence that made Quinn cough and then nod when she showed him because he understood the need to make a man put his own words in his mouth. She wrote: I don\u2019t understand you. I understand edges. He answered in eight seconds like a boy. He wrote: South steps. He wrote: Dark. He wrote: Bring light. He wrote: Bring your sorry.\n\nThey staged it like a play because everything with him had a stage and everyone with a badge knows how to use a theater when one\u2019s offered. Patrol was invisible in the ways they train for and rarely succeed at, boots memorizing squeaks, radios turned down so the god voice in them doesn\u2019t blow the part. Quinn tucked himself into a shadow he had decided belonged to him and the river made its old noise, the one she would hear in her bones long after she left this city for any amount of time. She wore her coat and her steady and a vest under the coat that felt like a liar\u2019s handshake because it always has to be too tight to feel like it will save you. She stood where he had told her because you do that when you\u2019re taught to be bait, and she didn\u2019t have to pretend to breathe harder than she wanted; the body does that when you call it to work.\n\nHe came like all theatre people come, late enough to make you remember you wanted him and early enough to make you doubt yourself for doubt\u2019s sake. He had cleaned up or he had borrowed clean from someone else; his coat had learned a new trick and the cap was gone and the hair was combed in the way men learn from other men in barracks or prisons or families. He held his hands in front of him, palms up, like he was coming to be searched and forgiven. He smiled the smile he had tried on in bathroom mirrors and on the glass of windows at night, and he said her name like he\u2019d earned it.\n\n\u201cThere are too many people at this party,\u201d he said, like he was being chivalrous on behalf of his sake. \u201cYou brought a choir. I wanted a duet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanted a stage,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one I could keep clean for you.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the stairs like they were listening. He had paint under one nail, a moon of it, stubborn. He put one hand on the rail, and the rail took its time, remembering everyone who\u2019d done that before him, and Dodge saw the moment her father had prepared her for without meaning to\u2014the point where a line wants to become a curve and the hand wants to show off. He had his back to the river, which is not intelligent if you plan on living. He had his mouth shaping something, maybe, sorry, soldier, he had all his little words and all his expensive paint and the edge of the step under his heel and for a second he thought he was the one who knew the choreography.\n\nShe said his name flat, the way you take color out of a wall, and it did a thing to his face you could only do with a word. He blinked and then didn\u2019t, and two things happened in the same heartbeat: a man who had no business walking his dog that late came up the far steps with enough noise to startle sleep and a gull laughed itself mean over the water. Nicolas moved toward the sound with his shoulders, and Patterson from Patrol stepped because he was built of that, and Dodge said no in a tone of voice she had honed on men much bigger than this, and Nicolas ran because running is a language the body knows even when the head thinks it is speaking art.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t fast the way television wants. He was efficient in the way boys who have run from houses are. He knew the weak slat in the fence by the fire lane and the alley where the trash bins tilt into shadows and the way you can flatten your ribs and become a page when a truck passes. Quinn was good and stayed good until he saw the way Nicolas used the curb to summon height and then he did the thing partners do\u2014it stopped being about orders and started being about your own body knowing how to do what it was built for. He cut left. He ate air. He lost him for ten counts in a parking lot that belonged to a church and a night chef and then he saw the flash that wasn\u2019t flash at all, the little flare of turquoise when a sleeve pulled up and Nicolas slapped his hand against a wall to turn and left the ghost of his pressure there.\n\nDodge did not run in a straight line. She ran the way water finds, hugging edges, looking for the place gravity was a rule and not a rumor. She saw him cut across a playground where the swing sets looked like gallows in the wrong light and into the mouth of a street that wanted to be a dead end and wasn\u2019t, and then he was gone, but not, because the smell hung back like a man\u2019s aftershave when he has failed to leave the room before you arrived. They stopped because stopping has to be allowed or you die in little inches, and she listened to the wind decide if it would tell on him. It didn\u2019t. It blew cheap and mean up from the river and carried laughter from a bar and the sound of a train reminding the city that it\u2019s always leaving.\n\nOn the playground, in the sand no one remembers to replace, at the base of the slide, was a paint chip the size of her thumbnail. She picked it up with the grim patience she had been taught and held it to her nose like a person prays, and it was him. It was the expensive stuff. It was the binder that dries too slow and makes the edge clean and the hand dirty. She pocketed it as a wrong kind of lucky token and straightened. Quinn stood beside her with his hands on his hips and his head down, breathing like a person who knows he still has stairs in him, and he let out a laugh he did not mean, the relieving kind, the why are we alive kind, the we will get him because he is not a god kind.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and the word had on it all the miles and none of the brag. \u201cSo he wants to run. We can run. He wants a stage. We can change the lighting.\u201d\n\nThey went back, reluctantly the way people leave a fight that isn\u2019t over, and it was only on the walk that Dodge let the world come back in around her at the edges. The city was doing its wet shine thing. Men smoked and tossed the butts at storm drains like they could plug them with their bad habits. Women in coats walked in pairs with their arms looped through one another like they had invented that. Somewhere a trumpet made a fool out of a cheap song. Her phone lifted its head. Rhea again, which meant good news or science. Rhea had a picture of the index card from the wall blown up until the fibers of the paper looked like a landscape. She had circled a little speck at the corner and annotated like a teacher: ash from gum wrapper? minted. She wrote: our boy chews the same brand as the wad under the radiator; also, the blonde hair you pulled belongs to Skye Delaney or someone with her mitochondrial story; she gave me a sample and rolled her eyes; don\u2019t read the second thing as bigger than it is; rooms share hair. Then, another text: DNA on the shirt hem is Daniel. Be kind when you write that down.\n\nDodge stood in the shadow of the precinct doorway with her phone brightening her face in a way she would punish in any other person and felt the shape of the thing in her hands. Not the case; the case was a house with too many additions and not enough foundations. The thing was the word he loved and the way the city used it and the way her mouth had been taught to carry it without biting down. She pictured him being eight and being told maybe about a Christmas tree and then told no when the check bounced and then told sorry when the lights didn\u2019t work and then told say thank you anyway, and that would be too easy if you believed in that kind of narrative. Men are not made of one night. They are made of every time they didn\u2019t get punched when they should have and every time they were kissed for saying they didn\u2019t mean it and every time someone hung a wall in front of them and told them paint is a way to make weight look like a choice.\n\nQuinn nudged her with his shoulder like a boy because sometimes you have to let the child part of yourself touch another person or you calcify. \u201cYou have thoughts,\u201d he said, and it wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cI hate his father for not believing in tape,\u201d she said, and he laughed low and let it be worth more than it was. \u201cHe will do something bigger to be the thing the city talks about and he will do it where we can\u2019t pretend not to look. He likes water and he likes steps and he likes walls and he likes being an average man walking into frame. He likes us more than he wants to. He will call again. He will call me, not you, not a tip line. He thinks we are in a drama where I have to understand him. He thinks this means I will forgive him when he tells me which day his mother left. He is wrong,\u201d she said, and the last two words felt like a small warm stove you can put your hands over.\n\nThe captain had a mood for them back upstairs. Someone had made a nickname for this that she could not deal with yet and he threw it on the ground and stamped it. He asked what it would take to keep any body from being painted across the face of the river and she said floodlights and hubris and four more bodies nobody had paid for. He assigned them three uniforms who knew a stage from a street. He told her to sleep and she didn\u2019t argue loudly; she would go home and lie down and watch the ceiling do its quiet job and make deals with herself about sugar and not answering calls and not thinking about tissue cards and then she would answer the call and think about the cards and eat Rhea\u2019s donut she had saved in the desk drawer like a sin.\n\nHe texted at eleven like a boy who had been told to wait an hour after eating to swim and couldn\u2019t. He wrote: That was fun. He sent nothing else. She did not answer because she respected the ancient magic of withholding. She fell asleep faster than she deserved to and dreamed that she had painted her throat bolts of turquoise and that men kept asking her to say maybe and she couldn\u2019t because her mouth was a wall, and when she woke she was biting her lip and the cat had slept on her calves like a sandbag.\n\nHer door buzzed at six like a rude morning. Colin was on the steps with a hoodie that said a school he didn\u2019t go to and a face that had learned three new ways to carry a day\u2019s worth of new weight. He held out a plastic storage bin like he had found it and didn\u2019t want to own it any longer than he had to. Inside, alphabetized in the way of boys who have been told to be careful without instructions, were Daniel\u2019s paintings, small ones done on paper cheap enough to fold, quick studies of wrists and necks and walls and the underside of elbows, shadows that didn\u2019t pretend to be anything other than themselves. In the bottom, folded twice, a list, his tidy summer-school hand again, supply runs and names and a note to self: if he says maybe, ask him where the yes lives. The yes had never lived in that man and they had missed it or they had known it and thought they could invent it and either way they were in it now.\n\nColin cried and said he was sorry and then got angry and said he was tired of that word and then said it again because habits are harder to break than hearts. Dodge gave him the ugly truth in a soft voice, which is the only way to do it where it sticks without scarring. She told him they had a name and a half and a father and a wall and that they would now begin the part of the story where incompetence gets loud and luck gets greedy and a man learns what it feels like when a city says the smallest word it knows and means it.\n\nOn the way in, the river was a steel belt around the city\u2019s belly and the morning had decided on hard blue like paint chips on a table. The wall, the turquoise one, had acquired a second line in the night, written in the hand of someone who couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and needed to fight back with letters. Beneath HE SAID MAYBE some stranger had written in spray paint the color of asphalt warmed by August: I SAID NO. The city had found its chorus. Patrol had rolled their eyes and then kept the tape tight. A woman in a green beanie mouthed thank you to no one and walked on.\n\nThe phone rang on her desk before her computer could remember its password. He let her hear him breathe for a long enough count that she knew he had been practicing being calm. \u201cYou ran,\u201d he said, as if she had been the one moving. \u201cYou smelled like old rain and metal and that made me want to tell you something good.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me something useless,\u201d she said, because that\u2019s how you make men like him talk, you lower the bar to a place where they think they will trip over it in triumph and then they bring you something they didn\u2019t mean to.\n\n\u201cDid you know turquoise is the stone people carry against the evil eye,\u201d he said, smug with research and his own sense of being connected to older things. \u201cIt keeps bad looking at you. It keeps envy from chewing holes in your shirt. It\u2019s why women wear it on their throats, so you don\u2019t get caught there. I think that\u2019s beautiful. Do you think that\u2019s beautiful, soldier.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you read the little card in the case at the jewelry store,\u201d she said, and he laughed, pleased with the picture of himself being both petty thief and poet. \u201cTell me where you keep the brushes you don\u2019t like. Tell me where you put the color you hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t keep what I hate,\u201d he said. \u201cI make it into something and then I leave it where someone else has to decide what to do with it. You do that too. You keep making me into something I am not and then you pretend you don\u2019t have to own it. Listen. I\u2019m telling you something good now. Tonight they have an art walk and girls in boots will drink wine out of plastic and people will pretend they are patron saints because they pointed at a wall and said nice and then bought a candle. I will be working. I will give you a front-row seat. Wear a coat,\u201d he said, affectionate as a caution, and hung up before she could tell him she was already wearing it and had been for years.\n\nShe sat in the chair long enough to be a piece of furniture, then she stood because chairs make you soft. She told the captain they were going to the art walk and he said how many and she said all of them. She told Rhea to bring the kind of powder that makes bad plans visible and Rhea said she liked walking downtown on the city\u2019s good nights because she could feel the power running under the sidewalk like a river that had decided to be useful. She told Quinn to buy a hat that would keep the drizzle out of his ears because he looked like a man who got an earache when he was a boy and never grew out of it. He told her she looked like she had decided to shoot him tonight and she told him she had decided not to.\n\nBy five, barricades made streets think they were safe. Trucks with ladders and lights blocked off corners for no reason other than to make a mood. Pops of generator noise stitched the air into squares. Children with parents who wanted them to be cultured and not poor walked holding hands so hard their arms got longer. A man on a soapbox preached against everything that was not his god and a woman sold ceramics with little holes in them to keep people honest. The Livery had a banner someone had painted with a broom and a hopeful mind. Skye stood in the doorway and did the work all women do when they are in charge of a thing in public, she greeted and counted and watched and wanted and pretended not to worry about the way several men lingered without an excuse. She saw Dodge and gave her a nod that said I will not let my kids die for your investigation and Dodge nodded back a language that said she didn\u2019t plan to let anyone die for anything.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show his face first. He left a handprint, on a utility box at hip height where drunks steady themselves, fingers in turquoise, the thumb at that little strange angle, fresh enough that the air carried the smell and a woman in a leather jacket smeared it with her handbag without noticing and said damn and then laughed because she loved herself for pretending not to care. He left a thin line on the curb, a clean line where curb met street, a stripe that would mean nothing to anyone who hadn\u2019t stood in his room and watched him practice pressure. He left a word in the condensation of a window, breathed on, fingered in: almost. He left it over and over on different panes in different hands, his, or the hands he liked to make his. He was making her walk. He was making her look. He was making himself into a weather pattern.\n\n\u201cSouthwest corner at Commerce,\u201d Quinn said over the radio in a voice that had learned to leave yawns in two blocks back. \u201cMan with average height and a cap we hate just put a bottle with tissue in it on a ledge. Not lit. Not a fire. A flower. That old trick. White roses wrapped in blue. He likes his craft stores.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t spook him,\u201d she said, and hated that it was true, that you have to not spook a man like this until he believes his act enough to hand you the bow. She walked instead of running because running makes crowds behave like schools of fish and then nothing is good again for an hour. She saw him from thirty feet and didn\u2019t make it known that she had. He was taller and shorter as usual, and the average of him was the weapon. He had eyes that would look blue if you wanted them to and brown if you didn\u2019t. He had a brush in his hand and he was using it on air, practicing strokes and letting the bristles kiss nothing, and the nothing kissed back. He stepped up on the low wall that kept a perfect child from rolling into a hedge, and he made something out of the night and his wrist.\n\nHe painted a boy\u2019s face. Not Daniel\u2019s. Not anyone she knew. He painted a face onto the blankness of a temporary construction scrim, huge strokes that were too sure for a drunk, not enough mistakes for a real artist with an audience. The face was a face you\u2019d like, a face you\u2019d tell to come in out of the rain. Over it, he wrote in the large hand kids learn when adults are watching: HE SAID MAYBE. Below it, in smaller letters, in a hand he made tender on purpose: It\u2019s okay. I asked. The crowd murmured the way crowds do when they want to be part of a conversation. A teenager took a selfie with his tongue out and his friend\u2019s hand on his neck in a way that pretended to be a joke.\n\nPatrol shouldered and breathed. Quinn stepped into a place where the night light was all ankle bone and watched, gun not up, other hand making a shape in the air that said not yet. Dodge stood still the way she\u2019d been trained, which is to say while every muscle begged to be used, and she said the man\u2019s name because it worked when you said a dog\u2019s name and it worked when you didn\u2019t want it to. He turned his head like a fox who hears his own song.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, but he said it like someone who was asking her to watch more, not like someone who expected obedience. \u201cIt\u2019s not done. It\u2019s not done when you stop liking it. It\u2019s done when I\u2014\u201d\n\nShe closed the distance with a pardon me that belonged in a different room and put her hand on his brush hand just hard enough that the bristles squealed. He went still and the crowd did that small sound\u2014oh\u2014and a man at the edge with a camera decided whether to stand down or become a journalist. His skin was warm, and men are that, and it won\u2019t save or convict them. He blinked once like a camera with a slow shutter and then faster because this is what you do when a woman touches you where you want to be in charge. She held until she could feel his pulse not just through his wrist but through the plastic handle of the brush, which is too intimate a thing to know about a stranger. She let go. She stepped back enough to be a cop again and not whoever that had been.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s your yes,\u201d she said, and the word was a small sharp tool in her mouth. \u201cI will say yes to arrest. Nicolas Geoff Harlan, you\u2019re under arrest. We can recite the rest by the book or I can sing it.\u201d\n\nHe smiled because he knew the book and songs and thought his role was written for him. He glanced past her shoulder like men do when they don\u2019t want to show their hands. He shifted his weight on the wall like a boy who has done benches his whole life. He went left and Quinn was already there, the scarf somehow useful now as decoration if not defense, and the patrol officer with the good mother\u2019s instincts put her hand out and took the brush in one smooth move like she had been handed things by men her whole life and learned finally how to accept them as evidence and not gifts. He tried to pivot and the crowd did that thing they do where nobody wants to be the person the story sticks to when it is over, they parted and they closed and they raised their phones like candles in old churches, and the river forgot its own name for a beat.\n\nHe ran. They ran. He went around the side of the box truck with the catering logo and down the gap between two galleries that used to be a life and now were a retail dream and a place you could buy a bag that would never go out of style and he hit a closed gate and it hit back. He climbed and his foot slipped and his wrist left a clean line of turquoise down the cheap paint of the gate and then he was over and he was gone into a back lot where men smoke and girls cry and brooms lean. Quinn went for the street because he knows to be a band, not a solo. Dodge went for the gap because she is built for it and hates it and does it anyway.\n\nHe had planned it. Of course he had. He had practice runs that had taught him how his breath sounds at the corner, how the light falls on the obliging puddle, how to slide under the lip of the dumpster without cutting his coat, how to keep his average height from being nothing by making himself into a shadow on the brick that nobody looks at until it moves. He had set a paint card on the ground like a trick coin. She didn\u2019t step on it. She jumped it like a child playing at not getting lava on her shoes, and then she smiled because you have to take the small pleasures you can when a man has stolen as many of the bigger ones as he thinks he owns.\n\nHe went up a fire escape that hadn\u2019t earned the name. She followed with a proficiency her knee protested and the badge on her chest reminded her why. He had a head start and that was the whole trick with lives like his. On the third landing, he stopped not because he was tired but because he wanted a picture. He turned and held his hands up again, palms, those paint-mapped machines, and he looked over her shoulder at the old city like a lover he was leaving and he said sorry like he had always said it, and she had so many places in her body that remembered that word she didn\u2019t know where to put it anymore. She put it in the handcuff. She put one cuff on him and the metal did its precise, ancient whisper, and then somebody yelled in the street below because it was Friday and their own fight had come due, and Nicolas was a man who used noise like a lever. He jerked his wrist, her hand slipped through turquoise that had not made itself dry, he twisted, he put his shoulder into her collarbone like an apology, she swallowed air she hadn\u2019t meant to, he went up one more flight and her body forgot what she had promised it about not running up stairs anymore.\n\nOn the roof, the city was a new platform he had built without permission and loved because of that fact. The river was a piano lid propped open. The wall with the turquoise could be seen if you stood on your toes. He made as if to bow. He made as if to jump. He had never wanted to be dead; he had wanted to see the look on a woman\u2019s face when he made her believe he might. She told her gun to keep its mouth shut. She walked the last three yards like there was nothing left to break. He stepped back. His heel found nothing. He flinched like a fish. She grabbed his coat with a hand that had held the inside of a man\u2019s ribcage once and felt the slick shine of expensive paint against cheap fabric and then he was weight, all the ordinary of him, and the two of them were a shape that from the street would look like something else, and the edge put its cold truth against her knuckles, and the river laughed.\n\nThey fell half a story and hit the next roof, an ugly little annex that didn\u2019t know it was important until just then, and the way her body learned to fold under other bodies kept it from being worse. He tried to make himself a ghost and she introduced him to the idea of gravity with her knee across his clumsy beauty. She showed him a wrist lock in the kind of gentleness you learn in Army tents and women\u2019s bathrooms and she put the second handcuff on him like you lower a curtain on a show that has outstayed. The sound the cuffs make when they are done right is not loud. It is a decision. It is a door closing on a room you don\u2019t need to visit again. It is the sound she likes best when she is allowed to have favorites.\n\nPatrol found their way up with the kind of delay that means they didn\u2019t get paid enough to believe in themselves in buildings like this. Someone threw a rope in case anyone wanted theater. Quinn came around the lip of the annex with his scarf flung back dramatically like he might let himself have that, and he saw the two of them and his mouth did the truth and a joke at once. He said, \u201cGood evening,\u201d in that harmless way and bent and put his hand on Nicolas\u2019s shoulder like he was checking the temperature of a roast. Nicolas lay there breathing like he had been told to practice and looking up at a sky that was not his and making a little smile just for himself like a man who understands that the stage goes dark and has practiced elsewhere.\n\n\u201cYou good,\u201d Quinn asked her, and she wanted to say yes in the way that meant forever and nothing and instead she nodded because her throat had decided to do a different job.\n\nHe looked up at the thing, the city, the edge they had not fallen from, and he let himself have his own metaphor just that once. \u201cI don\u2019t like rooftops,\u201d he said. \u201cToo much sky.\u201d\n\nThey led him down stairs and into lights and into sound and into the habit men have of making other people look at them. He didn\u2019t fight because fighting would make him ugly and he can\u2019t stand that. He didn\u2019t cry because crying is for rooms where women own the door. He watched Dodge as if they were still on the phone, as if the only people in the city were him and her and the river, and he mouthed a word when no one else was looking. Maybe. She shook her head. No. He smiled like a man who has been told he is adored and instead has learned he is alive.\n\nWhen the room swallowed him, when the elevator\u2019s polite ding cut the night into pieces and made sense of them, she leaned against a wall that wasn\u2019t turquoise and let the cold of it climb her spine like a spine replenishing itself. The city breathed and people clapped because they had seen a show and were grateful even if they didn\u2019t want to admit to that part. The wall down the block wore its sentence into moonlight and the second line, the one some stranger had written, glowed faint where paint can sometimes talk itself into luminescence. I SAID NO. She said it out loud with her mouth as if she had not been saying it her whole life already, and she listened to the sound of the smallest word in English make the kind of difference she had joined uniformed men and then deserted them to learn.\n\nBack at the precinct, the ritual. Property forms and chain-of-custody and Rhea coming in with a grin like a pocketknife and taking things out of bags and putting them into their own new bags, better ones, where they\u2019d be told their names and then called those names in court. The captain shook her hand and liked his own grip as always. The district AG sent a text without punctuation that might have been heart or eye-roll or both. Davenport asked if anybody wanted pizza and nobody wanted to say yes because it would look unprofessional and then they all said yes because they had no sugar left and donuts aren\u2019t dinner.\n\nShe sat on the other side of the glass and watched him take in the room that had a table and two chairs and everything in it meant to make you think it\u2019s an ordinary place to talk. He liked rooms like this because he thought he could decorate the air. He took his seat like a king sitting on a crate and folded his hands like someone had told him once that only the guilty cross their arms and he had believed them because men like him always think there are rules and they can find them in themselves. He looked straight at the mirror because you can\u2019t not. He smiled mildly and practiced looking like he understood gravity. He had paint where you can\u2019t get it unless you\u2019re proud and careless at once, flecks on his ear, in the little whorl at the shell. His thumb again, that stubborn geometry, the scar that dreams up personality on its own.\n\nQuinn went in first because Dodge made herself old-fashioned sometimes and let a man pretend he could be a good cop so he wouldn\u2019t become a bad one. He did okay. He didn\u2019t say his name first. He didn\u2019t ask if he wanted water because offering men things gives them the wrong idea. He said, \u201cYou know why you\u2019re here,\u201d and Nicolas said, \u201cBecause you can\u2019t catch an idea on tape,\u201d and that got written down in the margin of the report with a small star next to it because it would sound good later in a courtroom on a podcast. He answered questions that didn\u2019t matter with precision and walked around questions that did like a man who has learned to circle a thing when the only word he\u2019s got is maybe. He said Daniel\u2019s name with tenderness that made Dodge\u2019s skin try out a new kind of crawl. He said sorry with a sincerity that would have fooled a kinder woman and an ambitious lawyer. He said soldier again, once, like he was checking to see if it still fit her.\n\nWhen it was her turn she took the room into her mouth and made sure it knew who owned it. She put the card from the wall on the table and didn\u2019t push it toward him and didn\u2019t make a sound when his eyes flicked and stuck like there was glue and God in there. She set the brush down next to it. She laid the receipt from the art store in its sleeve. She kept the picture of his father\u2019s front porch for later because mercy becomes weapon if you use it and she didn\u2019t want to. She watched his face soften when she chose fact over theater. She put the pictures of Daniel\u2019s text string in a row and left spaces between them so the silence could say what it needed. He made a sound then that wasn\u2019t a laugh and wasn\u2019t not, and she told herself to put that sound in a jar, label it, never let it out where it could make weather.\n\n\u201cYou like the line more than the man,\u201d she said, and he was so grateful to be understood in that small way that his shoulders came down two centimeters, the first honest thing he had done in a week except put a brush in a sink for her. \u201cYou like the part where the brush behaves under your hand more than the part where a person breathes. You think yes and no are the only colors and maybe is your mixing room. You take boys and you turn them into a medium and then you tell yourself that is mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see me,\u201d he said, amazed like a child, insulted like a man.\n\n\u201cI see how much you need to be seen,\u201d she said matter-of-fact. \u201cDon\u2019t get romantic. It\u2019s ugly on you.\u201d\n\nHe told his story because they always do. They have a version ready for when someone they respect asks the right shape of question and he thought she respected him because she hadn\u2019t shot him off a roof. He told her about the art walk where a girl had asked him to put paint on her face and then said maybe and then laughed and then kissed a boy who wasn\u2019t him and he had gone home and put his hand on his own mouth to remember what it felt like to be wanted and then taught himself how to make the line so clean he could live inside it. He told her about Skye, not the counselor, the other one, whose classroom smelled like black coffee and tired fabric and hope, who had said maybe as a way to say bring me something better than yourself and he had brought her the best color he had and she had said no, later, wait, not now, and it had made a country in him and he had moved there and given it a flag. He told her about the father and the ladder and the sound tape makes coming off paint and how satisfying that is and how if you can\u2019t have that there are other sounds you can make that nearly replace it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t give him the empathy he wanted now. She gave him paper. Forms. A pen. She gave him a box full of his own edges and told him to live there until a lawyer came to teach him other vocabulary. She let him waiver on a question she had no legal business asking because it would scratch the itch inside her he kept finding. She asked him if Danny had ever said no in a voice he could understand and he said he said maybe and I loved him for that, and she said thank you because that was the tiny admission that would turn into a rope later. She stood and left him the room as a consolation prize he didn\u2019t deserve and made herself down the hall and held onto the railing outside until her breath learned a new song.\n\nOutside the interview rooms, the precinct was tired. Davenport ate pizza with the careful fury of a man whose family is asleep in a house he pays for by ignoring them too many nights. Rhea came in with a list of what the brush would say for them in a judge\u2019s light. The captain wrote an email that looked like a tree if you squinted and she knew it was to the mayor and the subject was not art. Quinn took off his scarf and used it as a pillow without shame, and the fabric made a little mountain under his head. The printer jammed like a small rebellion. The coffee laughed at everyone.\n\nShe texted Skye Delaney because she owed her that and because she didn\u2019t want the news to be delivered to that woman by a screen she didn\u2019t choose. Skye wrote back a sentence that could only have been written by someone who lived inside art and barely tolerated police: We will hold a critique for consent in the morning; you can come or you can send me that portion of your budget. She liked Skye for that square jaw in her words. She told Skye yes not because she had money but because yes is a tool when you can make it do small things.\n\nOn her way out into the kind of night that knows it will be replayed for all the wrong reasons, she walked past the evidence room and looked in because she is a superstitious animal and likes to say goodnight to the things that made her day livable. The brush sat in its bag like a small king without a throne. The paint cards made a fan she could have put her face behind and learned a little bit of who she still was. The turquoise bottle she\u2019d bought sat in her own desk\u2019s drawer where she\u2019d left it, ridiculous and heavy and buckled in, and she considered throwing it away and considered drinking it and considered giving it to a child to make them messy and then shut the drawer because none of those solved anything.\n\nQuinn walked her to her car because that is the stupid ritual you observe when you\u2019ve almost died and didn\u2019t. He kept his hands in his pockets because he is a boy in that way and because he didn\u2019t want to make the shape of touch in the air where other eyes could call it something. He said, \u201cYou did good,\u201d and she did not reject it because sometimes men get to say things that feel like blankets and it\u2019s not insulting when they do. She said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t get shot,\u201d and he laughed the tired laugh again and said he was saving that for sweeps.\n\nHer phone buzzed while the heater failed at its job. The number was new and it shouldn\u2019t have been able to reach her and everything in her body that had finally sat down stood back up. She answered because she is obedient to her own rules. It wasn\u2019t him. It was a mechanical voice that wanted to be human telling her there was a collect call from the county jail and did she accept the charges and the spite of the system made her say yes because the only thing worse than hearing him from there was wondering which fish he was going to feed with his words.\n\n\u201cNicolas,\u201d she said like she was telling a chair what it was.\n\n\u201cI thought of one more thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI forgot to tell you that I never liked turquoise.\u201d He stopped because he needed the effect. He stopped because he thought it made him a poet. He stopped because this was the part where he tried to keep owning the brush. \u201cI did it for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks good on your wrist.\u201d\n\nShe hung up on him and put her head on the steering wheel like a woman who had just been asked to stay politely. She wiped at her skin and there was nothing there because she had washed it off hours ago, but the body keeps old paint. She drove home carefully because care is the only rebellion she had left that didn\u2019t cost paperwork, and the city laid itself down beside her over the bridge with its lights and its old trains and its boys and its maybes and its small quiet beautiful nos, and she believed for one stretch of straight road that all of that had been enough to make this chapter end.10\n\nThe courthouse did its best impression of not being a church and failed the way marble always does when it\u2019s asked to be neutral. Morning slid along banisters and decided to live for a minute on the long faces of portraits painted to look like men were large on a moral scale. The hallway had the strange hush of rooms full of people who have agreed to be quiet so the building will like them. Dodge stood with a coffee she didn\u2019t drink and watched the little theater set pieces roll by: a public defender flipping a file with his thumb the way gamblers carry a deck, a bailiff whistling under her breath like she was trying to teach a tune to a stubborn dog, a mother in a coat two sizes too thin holding herself through the elbows so her hands wouldn\u2019t go loose and break something.\n\nNicolas came in cuffed and averaged and did that thing, chin up enough to say he thought his neck was involved, eyes looking for the camera he could love. He had on the jailhouse orange that insists it is a joke until it isn\u2019t, and under it he wore his ordinary, the posture of someone who has learned to keep the top half of his body charismatic while the bottom half learns escape routes. He caught her in the crowd and let his mouth turn a fraction, not a smile, more the private sign men make to each other when the joke is the room. She didn\u2019t look away because not looking away was one of her flags, and anyway it didn\u2019t give him anything he didn\u2019t already believe he owned.\n\nThe judge wore her robe like it had been ironed into her at birth. She read the words they all knew she would read and made them sound like new because this is the work of people\u2019s voices when the law gets itself into a room\u2014repeat after me until the heat leaves it. The words had their narrow shoulders all in a row: second-degree murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence, unlawful restraint. A whisper went through the gallery like mice testing a wall. The public defender leaned in to Nicolas and said something short, the shape in the air of don\u2019t say soldier, don\u2019t say art, say nothing at all, and Nicolas did not nod because nodding is what you do when you obey.\n\nBail was a theory and then it wasn\u2019t. Denied because sometimes the city remembers itself. He looked back again, over the shoulders of the men who owned his wrists, and his mouth formed a word she didn\u2019t let herself lip-read. Maybe, of course. Maybe he said sorry because the syllables move the same. The room breathed and moved on.\n\nOutside, the cold had sharpened its teeth and bit in the place where the collar meets the neck because winter likes the weak seam. She put her shoulder against a column and watched a bicyclist pretend laws are for other kinds of wheels, and Quinn came up with a paper bag and a grin that had learned to show only the front row of his teeth. \u201cBagel,\u201d he said, a man making peace offerings to a woman who didn\u2019t eat when she needed to. \u201cSkye\u2019s thing is at ten. The kids are already posting about it like they invented critique and this time it matters. You coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing my sorry,\u201d she said dry, and he didn\u2019t say don\u2019t because there are times when men know better than to rescue you from your own line.\n\nThe Livery had dressed itself like a promise. They had put chairs in a circle that made room for someone indecisive, they had opened the high doors that let the light decide to be generous, they had brewed coffee in a machine that sounded like a freight train but delivered warmth like a midwife. On the chalkboard someone had written: CONSENT IS AN ART PRACTICE. Underneath, in small careful hand: and a policy. Skye moved through the room like she owned it and didn\u2019t; she reached to touch shoulders without touching, tipped her chin at the shy ones so they would step into the light if they wanted it, saw Dodge in the doorway and gave that little flicker of a smile that says I see you seeing me and neither of us is here as a mascot.\n\nThey started with breathing because people always forget how when they\u2019ve been spoken about. A boy with a glittered thumbnail said he\u2019d never had a cop in a critique and did he have to speak differently. A girl with a shaved head said we\u2019ll make the cop do the work and her smile took the sting out. Skye stood at the front and did not take the front; she took the role of the person who names the thing. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, the word pilling under her tongue like a sweater you love too hard, \u201cis not a stage direction. If you\u2019re working with bodies, yes is a sentence and it\u2019s either present tense or it isn\u2019t consent. We treat maybes as no until they arrive wearing a different coat.\u201d\n\nThey passed around a box of index cards like communion. Each had a word printed and blank space under it. Sorry. Wait. Now. No. They wrote on their cards and then read, not to be graded but to let the air hold it. A sophomore who wore her dead grandmother\u2019s ring like a knuckle said she had a bruise of turquoise under her nail still and she didn\u2019t know how to feel about wanting to keep it. A boy with long hair and a mouth like a trouble song said he\u2019d been asked to pose and he\u2019d said maybe and then he\u2019d said no and then he\u2019d said sorry because men always want the last word and he was tired of keeping them company. A kid Dodge remembered from the wall\u2014hat too big, coat thrifted into dignity\u2014said he had painted with Nicolas two years ago and nothing bad happened and he still felt like he\u2019d been walked to the edge of something and shown the view.\n\nSkye held the room when it started to tilt. \u201cWe\u2019re not Nuremberg,\u201d she said, and the laugh that went through the circle made it back to her like gratitude. \u201cWe\u2019re not tribunal. We\u2019re learning how to ask and answer in a language that keeps our bodies ours. If police want to take notes, they do it without making a mess.\u201d She looked at Dodge with kindness edged in steel. \u201cYou can stay without owning it. Or you can talk. Your choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to listen,\u201d Dodge said, and kept her hands quiet on her knees. The room made a small sound at that because you can trust a woman who knows which part of the sentence to swallow.\n\nAfter, the kids brought her a pile of names as if names were ransom and she was the kidnapper willing to bargain. Jae came up like a shadow making a decision. They had hair that didn\u2019t tell you a pronoun and a voice that had learned how to be heard by forcing interesting onto it. \u201cHe asked me to be a second,\u201d Jae said without preamble, eyes on a point over Dodge\u2019s shoulder where a wall had learned to be looked at and not noticed. \u201cLike a diving meet. Safety friend. He wanted me to hold, not to watch. I said yes and then I said no and then he said maybe like it\u2019s a wet blanket you throw on a fire and I left because I like when rooms keep belonging to me when I go,\u201d they added, almost cheerful with survival. \u201cHe\u2019s been around. He\u2019s built for other people\u2019s edges. You have a list already, but I have his side doors. He goes in through supplies.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupplies,\u201d Dodge said, hearing in it all the synonyms\u2014excuses, tools, love letters.\n\n\u201cHe hangs around the aisle at the big box with the fancy wall paint, talks to people who hold their color cards too long,\u201d Jae said. \u201cHe says things about undertones like he\u2019s flirting with the idea of being useful. He offers to teach you to cut in freehand because tape is for girls and then he says he\u2019s kidding and then he says sorry and buys you a cheap brush because he thinks poverty is a vaccine against future crime. He got your boy at the south steps, right. He likes stairs. It\u2019s theater seating.\u201d\n\nThey scribbled a map on the back of a handout for a ceramics sale, X marks the stupid places Nicolas had liked to hang his talent and wait for someone to costume it. Dodge folded it and put it in the side pocket where future becomes now. She left a note on Skye\u2019s table that said thank you because it was a spell worth saying in rooms that teach and destroy in equal parts.\n\nThe captain called when the sunlight had decided to be unforgiving and had sent the dust in the Livery into frantic choreography. \u201cFamily notification,\u201d he said, and there was apology in the back of his throat because a man like him will never not hate this part. \u201cYou should come. She asked for a woman when Davenport said \u2018detective\u2019 and he didn\u2019t correct her. He couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDaniel\u2019s mother lived in a house that was in a polite argument with its lawn. The winter had made a decision and the yard had not been allowed to have one. She had oranges in a bowl because that\u2019s what mothers do in winter when they want the idea of sun inside their rooms. The couch had a throw blanket that tried too hard and a cat that didn\u2019t, and the photo frames did the thing of only holding the moments you\u2019d planned to live and didn\u2019t. Davenport sat on a chair he looked too large for and held his hat in his lap like he was a boy in church who had been asked to behave his body.\n\nShe brought them tea without asking if they wanted it. She set the cups down on coasters that looked like little pieces of geography, cork islands against spill. She looked at Dodge like she might tell the truth if someone else did first. \u201cThey said you caught him,\u201d she said, and her voice had the tone of someone talking on the phone while turning off burners. \u201cThey said it was on the news. That doesn\u2019t make my boy less hard to look at when I close my eyes, so you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe caught the man we believe did this,\u201d Dodge said, and she wished the English language had a tense for certainty that could still be kind. \u201cThe person who made Daniel stop.\u201d She used his name like chalk on a blackboard, it held shape that way. \u201cI am sorry. I will keep being sorry as long as it\u2019s useful. If there is anything you want to know that doesn\u2019t make you bleed, I will answer.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s mouth made a small practical line and then a twist, and the twist was the hard part. \u201cWas he alone,\u201d she asked, and Davenport opened his mouth to fall into the scripted holes and Dodge put her hand on the coffee table not touching him, touching the wood, to say let me. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe so,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think he had help with logistics, not with intent. There are people who will need to live with their names for a while in ways they didn\u2019t choose, and we are going to make that as small for them as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the woman said, and then the porches of her face collapsed at once and she was suddenly younger and older. \u201cHe liked blue when he was little. He\u2019d make the sky wrong and I\u2019d say baby the sky isn\u2019t that color and he\u2019d say maybe it is in our neighborhood. I kept one of the pictures. It was on the fridge until the magnet got tired,\u201d she said, and she made herself stand up to go get it because grief makes you get up for the strangest chores and obey. She came back with a paper that had lost its crisp and handed it over with pride like a mother hands a diploma. The sky was a wild wrong blue and the sun was a square and there were three figures at the bottom, two tall and one small, and the small had a smear between its shoulders like a wing. \u201cI want to not hate that color forever,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t help me do that, but I thought I\u2019d say it out loud so God would have to hear me.\u201d\n\nShe saw them out with the politeness women learn from being asked to be hospitable to their own hurt. On the porch, the wind took a run at Dodge\u2019s knees and she let it because fighting the weather doesn\u2019t make it less weather. Davenport stood on the walk and practiced a sentence into air he didn\u2019t mean to say to anyone and then swallowed it and looked at her like a man who had carried a piano by himself up a flight of stairs and decided he could do it again if she asked.\n\nBack at the building that was supposed to fix things, the phones had discovered more ways to ring, which is what happens when a face gets on television. A woman insisted she had been painted turquoise by her boyfriend as a surprise and that made him a suspect and then she cried because she wanted to confess that she had liked it, and someone wrote her info down in case liking could be used as evidence somewhere later. A boy with a voice that broke in two places said he had walked under the bridge and saw the bottle and thought it was pretty and took a picture and then felt like a murderer because beauty had talked to him, and she told him to email the photo anyway because beauty sometimes keeps the widest angle. A man from out in Dickson called to say he once tutored a Nicolas Harlan in GED math and he always did his edges too neat on graph paper and what did that mean about a soul.\n\nThey put Nicolas in a room with his public defender that smelled like state budget and sob stories, and he played with the paper cups like he was a child again. He wrote a letter that he couldn\u2019t send because it wouldn\u2019t help him and put it in his shoe because men do that; they like secrets that sweat. He called and asked for her and twice she didn\u2019t answer and the third time she did because you can\u2019t pretend a river isn\u2019t on the far side of your house if you can hear it from the yard. \u201cWhy are you there,\u201d he asked, as if she were the inmate. \u201cYou could come sit with me and look at the ceiling until the paint makes animals.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I have a cat,\u201d she said, and it was true in the way that makes men angry because they want myth and you give them errands. \u201cBecause work expects me to finish what I start. Because not answering you is a choice I get to make.\u201d\n\nHe was quiet long enough that she thought the call had already cut. \u201cDo you wear the wristwatch on the left,\u201d he asked finally, small as a boy invited to sit at the bar, and she hung up on him with all the relish she allowed herself and set her phone face down on the file that had learned how to get heavy.\n\nAfternoon practiced being night on the faces of buildings and failed and practiced harder. A crew in city vests came to the wall with a power washer and a tarp and a man with a face that had forgotten how to hope, and three women in puffer coats stood in front of the turquoise sentence with their arms threaded like fabric, and Skye arrived with a bullhorn she hadn\u2019t asked for and a speech she hadn\u2019t written and a kind of authority that some people are born to and some people teach themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re not saving a vandal,\u201d she said to the men, who had learned to speak in clauses that contained liability. \u201cWe\u2019re protecting a conversation.\u201d They stood there breathing fog at each other until the man with the hose remembered his daughter\u2019s braces bill and lowered the nozzle half an inch, and the women took a step forward the way people in small towns take pies to porches, and someone on the phone at City Hall said hold, hold, hold, and the wall stayed decorated. Below, someone had added a third line in marker that would not last the rain: WE ARE NOT YOUR CANVAS.\n\nAt her desk, the machine in Rhea\u2019s hands turned the brush into a person with a social security number. \u201cI\u2019ve got your boy on the bristle,\u201d she said, almost triumphant, and rolled her chair back to look at Dodge like a magician who still believes in science. \u201cEyelash, skin flakes if you like uglier words. Daniel is in the seam like a memory that has learned glue. He can talk for you from there. It\u2019s not pretty and it\u2019s exactly enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Dodge said, and let the good live in her mouth for a second longer than she\u2019d meant. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to go farther back. If there are others, they might be living their lives not knowing they\u2019re in a category. He said practice. He\u2019s not good enough to have started at Danny.\u201d She heard the sentence and the little spine of cruelty that runs along the top of the truth and she swallowed it because accuracy matters even when it\u2019s an insult.\n\nRhea flipped through printouts with a finger that had a glitter of blood under the cuticle from a cutter and ignored it like lab people do. \u201cI pulled five incidents with turquoise weirdness in them from the last three years that weren\u2019t blamed on teens with time to burn,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo were dismissed as prank art and one as a wellness check that didn\u2019t need to be, and one is in your old friend Davenport\u2019s pile from last spring when a boy walked into Saint A\u2019s on Palm Sunday with blue paint under his collar and said he needed to confess something that wasn\u2019t sin. He gave a name. It wasn\u2019t Nicolas. It was a person who doesn\u2019t exist unless you know where to look. Blue. Cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlue shows up on his contact list,\u201d Dodge said, and got the special little hit in her chest that feels like an elevator arriving at the right floor. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking for a shade, not a person. A supplier, a second, somebody who likes being in the room when a man reminds himself he\u2019s important. We find Blue and we find the corners he\u2019s been practicing in.\u201d\n\nThey went back into footage the way people go back into dreams they didn\u2019t understand\u2014hopeful, a little embarrassed. The lobby tape yielded small graces when you watched it with patience: a scuff of dye on the heel of a hand, a piece of tape stuck to a jeans cuff like a forgotten vote sticker, the little boxy bag you only see on men who carry tools and don\u2019t call them that. They spotted the bag enough times that they made it a character and then followed the character through three corridors and two days, and eventually the bag hung from the chair in a coffee shop and the person attached to it attached to a face. Blue was not a color; Blue was a woman with a mouth full of secrets and a smile that had seen both sides of a church. She wore her dyed hair out of her eyes like she didn\u2019t mind what you thought about her decisions and set a brush down beside her latte like a person who won\u2019t pretend with you and then will.\n\nThey found her by the river because everyone does, and she rolled her eyes for so long that Dodge imagined it as a cardio routine. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, when the badge came out, and her voice did a slalom around contempt and landed on bored. \u201cHe gets famous, I get visited. He\u2019s a bowerbird at heart. He makes piles from other people\u2019s shiny and calls it a nest. He liked me because I\u2019m pretty on bad days and I don\u2019t make a show of knowing it, and also because I have a brain that can categorize undertones in my sleep. He thought we were a match. I told him maybe and I meant no and he heard a lifestyle choice. You want coffee. It\u2019s a day for paying for women\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nThey took the table that wobbled even when it promised not to and let Blue tell it in her order, which is how you get truths that stick. She had met him in the aisle near varnishes, of course, had laughed when he said tape is for people who don\u2019t trust themselves and then had bought two rolls of tape. He\u2019d shadowed her to the register and paid for a brush she didn\u2019t need and she had let him because poverty is a language and because she believed in interest-free debts. He had asked her to bring a kit to a shoot, called it a shoot like that had authority, and she had gone because she does that; she goes places with her eyes open. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid,\u201d she asked, and when neither of them moved, she answered herself. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m curious. That looks the same from a distance. He made the boy into color. The boy liked it. That\u2019s true. He also made the boy into a wall to talk to and that\u2019s not okay. That\u2019s the part I got loud about. He didn\u2019t ask me back because I wasn\u2019t a mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have dates,\u201d Quinn asked, making it into a small thing he could have in his hand. \u201cPlaces. Anything we can pin.\u201d\n\nBlue smirked like a woman who has saved all the receipts of her life without meaning to. \u201cHe liked basements that used to be bars and rooms with one good window and churches on weekdays when the door\u2019s open for the ghost of Jesus,\u201d she said, and she ticked them off with her fingers, old names and new ones. \u201cSouth steps always. A motel off Carroway that lets you do cash and not look you in the face. The Livery, before Skye told him to grow up and then smiled because she can do both. A house on Houston that used to be his father\u2019s friend\u2019s rental until his friend stopped being his father\u2019s friend. Hey. He never paid me. That\u2019s not your problem, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou left,\u201d Dodge said, and watched the way Blue\u2019s mouth filed that sentence under compliment with an option to appeal.\n\n\u201cI left when he asked me to hold the boy\u2019s face still while he breathed through his nose and I said how about if we don\u2019t, and he said maybe and then he said sorry so fast it sounded like a laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cHe likes the part where he puts his hand on a man and calls it caution and then gets to remember later that he was necessary. Men have built entire religions that way. You going to put me on TV. Don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to be the girl who says boys do this. I want to teach a class where girls don\u2019t get in rooms where boys make them assistants for their crimes.\u201d\n\nWhen they stood to go she pulled a thing out of her bowerbird nest\u2014a paint card with a greasy thumbprint in turquoise on the back and the name of the color circled on the front. It said Poolhall Kiss in a font that wanted to be flirtatious and there was an A next to it, approved by the only committee that mattered to him. \u201cHe left it under my sink because he thinks I clean the way he does. He\u2019s bad at leaving no mark,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that. That\u2019s why you like him. He\u2019s an easy man to find if you stop pretending he\u2019s a genius.\u201d\n\nNight arrived with its tray of old tricks and a new one he had built from inside a cell. A letter came on law office letterhead because he had learned that paper can be a key if you color inside the lines hard enough. It was folded with the care of a boy who still believed stationery can save you. Inside was a drawing on yellow legal paper in pencil\u2014not turquoise, as if he wanted to prove he could operate in lack\u2014a set of hands practicing a line, five strokes from fat to fine, the pressure map of a father\u2019s kitchen. At the bottom he had written in a version of penmanship that had tried to be saintly and fallen into neat: This is how you were made. Do you forgive me yet.\n\nShe did not show it to anyone who would mistake it for a threat or an apology. She put it in the folder where she kept the outliers, the things that are going to matter late and then make you angry that you didn\u2019t throw them away. She took Plank out of the bathroom sink where he liked to live because he imagined himself a fish and let him put his paw on the drawing as if that could baptize it into harmlessness. He yowled and she yowled back because talking to a cat is one of the safe kinds of madness.\n\nShe fell into sleep like a person learning the shallow end and dreamed of tape. In the dream, her father was alive and teaching tape, which is impossible because he hated it, and he showed her how to lay it so it would peel back without tearing the wall and he said you only get one clean, and she woke knowing more about tape than she had before and hating what that meant. The phone flashed once and did not ring, and she learned to read a light like a sentence.\n\nThe next day the city remembered that it had other crimes, other messes, other children to be gotten into school. Their case became an object you can set down if you have to wipe a counter, and she put it on the shelf carefully, not because she was done with it\u2014she never would be\u2014but because balance is not a suggestion; it is a tool you sharpen or it goes dull at the wrong time. Nicolas called twice and her voicemail took both messages and refused to translate them into text; some things are not made into transcripts without losing the temperature that matters. He left the word soldier the second time and then didn\u2019t speak and left her with a minute of the sound of a man thinking he is a storm.\n\nA kid with a scooter busted his lip in front of the precinct and bled onto the step where she had sat the week before thinking about the river. She took a napkin from her pocket like a mother in a pew and gave it to him and his mother said I\u2019m sorry in a tone that sounded like I\u2019m sorry for all of this, which is a lot for a city block to hold. In evidence, the brush sat while a chain of custody wrote itself into genealogy. The shirt hem swore harder that it knew who it had touched. The wall held its turquoise sentence like a bruise you have decided to live with so you can keep wearing dresses, and the second line, the angry one, the beautiful one, found cousins on three other walls in hands that weren\u2019t his.\n\nQuinn brought her a list of old cases that might love this one and she took it the way a woman takes a baby she didn\u2019t ask to hold and then discovers she\u2019s very good at. They knocked on doors that smelled of different kinds of poverty. They learned the names of boys who had been painted once and learned to scrub and kept their shame in corners that did not grow. They went to a church basement where an art therapy group had practiced being tender in a room with folding chairs and a coffee pot that burned everything it touched. A man there said he had been a canvas and liked it and then hadn\u2019t, and that\u2019s how he knew the difference between being adored and being arranged. He said sorry four times for saying it out loud and then laughed at himself until breathing was easier.\n\nAt lunch she saw Skye Benning on the steps of her building with a student sitting three inches too close because closeness is a drug you learn to take in doses, and Benning had her body arranged between the kid and the air like a gift and a wall at once. They talked without saying the parts that would make the talk too interesting. Skye told her she had a bookcase that was too full and that\u2019s what it feels like sometimes inside a head like hers, and Dodge said she had a drawer that held a bottle of turquoise and she couldn\u2019t decide if throwing it away would be a failure of nerves or an act of faith. \u201cKeep it,\u201d Skye said, and her face was not kind, it was exact. \u201cKeep it and choose every morning whether to open the drawer. That\u2019s the practice.\u201d\n\nIt should have stayed simple then, which is to say the size of a man. But the world is not a drawer you get to close. On a Thursday that saw fit to be spring for two hours before it remembered itself, a body was found under a billboard that wanted her to buy a mattress. No paint. No lines. A girl who sold shoes found him and then folded in on herself and called no one and then called everyone, the way people find religion in steps. The boy\u2019s face had been pressed into dirt and there were fingerprints of someone else\u2019s hand on the back of his neck, ordinary prints, not art. He looked seventeen in the way numbers sweat for boys like that. The city inhaled and held it while it decided whether to blame the turquoise for all of it. \u201cCopycat,\u201d someone said in the hall in that way which is really wishful thinking dressed up as clever, and the captain\u2019s mouth did the old-man thing and he told them to take their words to the parking lot and leave them running there.\n\nRhea came back from the scene with dirt under her nails and rage under her braid. \u201cNot him,\u201d she said, without turning it into a gift. \u201cNot his hand. The pressure is wrong and the print says a different story. We can walk and chew gum. I just want the city not to make one man a tent to live under.\u201d\n\nShe bought chapstick in the vending machine she never had change for because her mouth had decided it wanted a project. Back at her desk there was a drawing in her in-box, slid under the glass like an old school secret. A face in pencil, not the boy from the billboard, a different boy, the parts of a face you memorize first\u2014eyes, mouth, the tilt of the cheek where you\u2019d put your hand if you loved him\u2014sketched with the light futility of someone practicing being gentle. Underneath, in a hand that looked ten and thirty at once: He said yes. She sat with it longer than was strategic because there\u2019s strategy and then there\u2019s being a person.\n\nThey processed Nicolas\u2019s room again because if there is a place where a man keeps the keys he hands out to other people\u2019s houses, you go back armed with a new idea. Under the floorboard that had learned to creak at footsteps and keep secrets, Quinn found a envelope with a Catholic church\u2019s name on it that wasn\u2019t the one he\u2019d used for practice. Inside were five Polaroids from last winter, boys with paint on their shoulders like shawls, smiles in the complicated register between you and a camera and a person you want to be proud of you. Behind one, in a careful hand, he had written a date and that word\u2014maybe\u2014and beneath it in smaller script that wanted to be innocent: sorry for the mess. They bagged it all because paper is as loyal as you teach it to be. Her hands smelled like dust for two hours and she let them because there are worse perfumes.\n\nToward evening, when the city decides whether to be gentle or showy and usually splits itself badly between the two, she drove to the south steps because people are allowed to haunt places the way the dead do. The river had its Wednesday outfit on even though it wasn\u2019t Wednesday, steel and moving and uninterested in being beautiful for her. She stood in the place where she had nearly fallen and listened to the voices that pick up their own echoes. A woman in a red hat came and stood at the top of the steps and didn\u2019t sit. She said to no one, \u201cIf I could do it over,\u201d and then laughed at herself because grief turns us all into theatre people practicing our lines.\n\n\u201cDo you forgive him yet,\u201d Quinn asked later, in the stupid little kitchen area that always smelled like soup that had decided against itself.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and let the joy be in the fact of having it to say. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to. Forgiveness is a color nobody gets to buy at a store.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the paint,\u201d he said, because he is a boy who likes endings to have props in them.\n\n\u201cIt stays in the drawer,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery morning, I\u2019ll decide. Sometimes I will open it. Sometimes I will leave it alone. Either way it will be mine, not his.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and put the sugar in his tea like he always does, too much for a man who wants to be serious, and she watched his hand and liked him for the way it didn\u2019t shake. The building creaked because it is old, and the printer hiccuped because it is poorly made, and the floor grille rattled because it is attached to the air that keeps them all from noticing the small deaths they suffer daily. The phone breathed in her pocket and she didn\u2019t pull it out. The city exhaled. On the wall, under the turquoise and the asphalt and the small handwriting, someone had added in chalk, chalk that will go away with the next honest rain: WE PRACTICE YES WHEN WE MEAN IT.\n\nThat night he called and the line put his breath in her ear like a hand. He didn\u2019t say soldier. He said her name the way the cat says food. \u201cThey\u2019re going to forget me soon,\u201d he said softly, like he was recommending a playlist. \u201cYou\u2019ll let them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry me,\u201d she said, even softer, and he waited for her to fill the silence. She held it. He hung up because he had nothing left that would keep his act from getting old and that is the worst thing to men who live on attention, worse than handcuffs, worse than rooms with chairs that don\u2019t move, worse than ceilings.\n\nIn the morning she drove out of her way to avoid all bridges because a petty private logic told her this was how you keep men in cages from walking through your head. She fed Plank and left the cupboard with its dot closed. She went to the wall with a cloth in her pocket and touched it to the turquoise and then didn\u2019t wipe, didn\u2019t correct, just pressed and lifted and left a print not of her hand but of the cloth. Maybe is a word with a hundred lives; she would not bury it but she would stop giving it citizenship everywhere. She walked back into her building with her feet loud on purpose and took her seat. The day bent its back and went to work, which is the only prayer she believes in when the rest of the city is practicing being art.",

                              "content": "The first body lay where the river bullied the bank, where kudzu tangled the signposts and whispering stacked itself between the train cars that had been abandoned so long they were part of the landscape. Dawn hadn\u2019t gotten its act together yet, just a wash of thin blue leaking from the lip of the sky. The men in canvas jackets were yawning around their coffee cups, steam rising\u2014exhaust from tired lungs. Flashers clicked in yellow, pooling light on rocks and riprap and the slick slopes where runoff gathered secrets.\n\nShe saw the color before she saw the face.\n\nTurquoise. Not hospital-blue, not the blotchy sky-blue that cheap denim fades into, not the watery color of a swim pool long after summer has left town. Turquoise, the way a stone looks on a woman\u2019s throat when she doesn\u2019t care who\u2019s watching her; old mountains crushed to powder and sealed in resin.\n\n\u201cDetective,\u201d someone said, moving their mouth around chewing gum. She didn\u2019t look to see who. She already knew the way the vowels sounded when her name came off strangers: Dodge, like a thing thrown at you. She walked down the slope, her boots making a sound like rain on cardboard. She had to lean, catch herself on a root; the Tennessee had been eating away at the bank again, wild and patient, the way grief gnaws.\n\nHe lay with his head against the concrete step someone had poured and forgot, and it didn\u2019t seem right, the way his neck couldn\u2019t decide which way to become slack. His hair had taken the paint like a bird\u2019s nest dipped in stormwater. Turquoise spread across his cheekbones and throat, across his chest in drips and with odd deliberation: places left bare like they were holding their breath. It shone when the light hit it. His eyes were open, and the whites were white, startling, not washed out by paint, so that he seemed to be witnessing his own painted body and could do nothing to argue. The paint had dried in beads along his lashes. No blood to speak of, no fight. The cold had done its job neat. He had been placed, not dropped. Whoever had done this had an aesthetic.\n\n\u201cMorning, Dodge,\u201d said Quinn, coffee cup in both hands, a scarf wound to his chin. He had pale cereal eyes, spooned and forgetful. \u201cWe got the call at four eighteen. Jogger called it in. We got\u2014well. You\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing,\u201d she said softly.\n\nThe jogger was standing near the cruiser, hugging himself like his upper arms had promised something and backed out. He\u2019d talked to Patrol already. He would talk again. He would say that it had looked like a statue at first. He would say he had seen art museums in bigger cities and this had the same hush except for the river keep saying hey hey hey against the rocks. He would say he hadn\u2019t thought to touch the boy. He had never seen that color on skin before.\n\nDodge knelt. Her knee hit frozen earth. It bit up through denim. She had done worse things with her knees. She had let them grind into gravel under the belly of a truck in Fallujah while she stuffed a torn-up tourniquet into a man\u2019s thigh and said you\u2019re okay you\u2019re okay you\u2019re okay, while the noon sun squatted like a jealous god. She didn\u2019t want to think of that here, not with the smell of latex and river and cheap coffee. She breathed like an instrument being tuned. She looked for fingerprints in the paint, for brush marks, for the pressure of a hand that had pressed this man back to stillness. There were brush marks, yes, precise, as though whoever had painted him had paused and turned the brush in their fingers to make the edges clean. As though he had been painted for an audience. As though being dead was a medium.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch,\u201d Quinn said reflexively. He knew she wouldn\u2019t. She looked anyway.\n\nAn index card was tucked under the boy\u2019s backside, as neat as a love note under a dorm pillow. Quinn had the sense to point with his eye rather than his hand. Dodge nodded. She put on her gloves. The paint didn\u2019t smear when she nudged his hip enough to free the edge of the card. It had adhered. He was heavy with it. This is how paint works; it makes things heavier. Her father had painted houses until his lungs filled with grit. She knew the smell of thinner the way some people know the smell of a good red sauce, and this had that, plus something camphor-bright, almost clean.\n\nThe card read: HE SAID MAYBE.\n\nQuinn said nothing, because they were new enough to each other that he still let her name the bones of things before he did. They had been thrown together three weeks ago with a pair of stupid smiles from higher-ups who liked the way their resumes matched like a bad blind date. You like guns? She likes guns. You like not sleeping? She likes not sleeping. You both look like you keep secrets like spare keys under your tongue.\n\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d she asked the corpse, softly enough it might have been to herself. The wind answered. It kept worrying the weeds. The sun stuck one shoulder over the treeline and stopped there, cocky or shy, she couldn\u2019t tell.\n\n\u201cWallet says Daniel Payne,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cTwenty-one. Vandy student. Wallet was left. Cash gone. Or he didn\u2019t have cash. Phone not present. No obvious contusions. We\u2019ll know more once\u2026 you know.\u201d He flicked his eyes at the ME van.\n\nShe waited for the memory. It arrived like a dog that doesn\u2019t come when called but when it feels like it, damp and defiant. He said maybe. He. The killer\u2014or the not-killer\u2014needed there to be a he. The paint insisted on it, in the way it illumined places that young men show to each other in locker rooms, the way it made exposed skin into an exhibit. He said maybe, and the color was chosen to match the feeling of being told that you are almost good enough but not quite, that you are the backup dancer for your own life.\n\n\u201cTurquoise,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPaint sample?\u201d Quinn said, as though asking her to dance. \u201cWe\u2019ll pull chips. See if there\u2019s an identifiable brand. You think the paint\u2019s meaningful or\u2014\u201d\n\nShe looked at him, not unkindly. \u201cYou think the paint isn\u2019t meaningful?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cI mean. Maybe it\u2019s what was in the closet. Maybe his mom does shabby-chic.\u201d\n\nShe looked at the way the paint had been applied to the wrists, like cuffs. The way the mouth was only half-coated, as if the brush had hesitated where lips become impossibly tender. \u201cHe chose this color. He practiced this color.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know him already,\u201d Quinn said, level, not accusing.\n\nShe did. In the way you know someone in a dream. In the way you know the silhouette that shows up when you close your eyes after a day of staring too hard. She sometimes saw him walking in front of her headlights at night, or standing on the meridian holding a bouquet made of receipts. She had given him a face once, just to make him stop knocking on the inside of her skull. But the face kept changing: sharp cheekbones and then none; eyes that electrician-blue and then muddy as river water. The one constant was the sound he made when he was looked at: the hiss of a match, the little laugh of someone who had been told no so often he had started to wear it like a coat.\n\n\u201cName?\u201d Quinn asked.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said maybe. You think there\u2019ll be a he who shows up. A\u2026 Nicolas? Doesn\u2019t every predator like to pick a silly name?\u201d\n\nShe did not flinch. But the name hit the inside of her like heat lightning. Nicolas. It arrived with the soft weight of a glove dropped on tile. Why had her brain kept that one? Because it was common enough to hide in plain sight. Because when you said it fast it became Ni-clos, and closeness was a joke people tell themselves to go to sleep.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not calling him anything yet,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He took a swallow of coffee and winced like the taste had turned. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d been called a soldier when she returned to Nashville, and then a detective, and both labels fit like a jacket you steal from someone you love and wear anyway, sleeves too long, shoulders a joke. She was built for standing still with her hand on a holster, for listening to the middle note in a lie. She had learned in the Army to make the world small: your squad, your sector, the radius you can see without turning. In the city, the world wants to do the opposite. It wants to widen until you can\u2019t perceive the edges. You think you are smart enough to hold all that in your head and then you dream of deserts when it\u2019s raining and you wake with grit in your teeth.\n\nBy the time they zipped Daniel Payne into a bag, the color had dried completely. The plastic rasped across it. There were little flecks on the concrete. A tech collected them with tweezer-slow care. She would get to sit in front of a microscope later and watch the world turn into flecks. It would be a comfort, how small and definite they could make things with a lens.\n\nOn the drive back, she took the long way\u2014a loop onto the Jefferson Street bridge, the ramp curling up and around like a snake that had forgotten its own tail. The city tossed its light back in her face, buildings glancing like teeth. Banners over the minor league stadium still flapped with last season\u2019s lies. Somewhere a siren laughed itself silly. She rolled her shoulders against the seat like she was making room for a ghost.\n\nAt her desk someone had left a file folder with a Post-it stuck like an accusation. Payne, Daniel. There were three pages in it she hadn\u2019t put there yet: a driver\u2019s license printout from the DMV that made him look fourteen; a campus ID photo where he tried too hard to look older\u2014jaw jutted, hair ironed into obedience\u2014and failed; an email printout from a professor that simply said, He missed class yesterday. Possible extension for midterm? The professor had probably attached a syllabus. Because that\u2019s how adults apologize to each other: with PDFs.\n\nShe read the pages like prayers, knowing they would not answer and still hoping they would.\n\nThe receptionist dropped a package on her desk. Sturdy cardboard, taped and re-taped, address block printed in the tidy font of an old typewriter: Metropolitan Nashville Police Department: Detective Dodge. No return label, only a smear of something blue-green on the seam like a fingerprint from a child who has been allowed to play with his mother\u2019s eyeshadow for the first time.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s it from?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe receptionist shrugged. \u201cGuy in a cap. Didn\u2019t look at me. Left it on the chair by the elevators and skedaddled. You want me to call\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStay,\u201d she said, and picked up the box.\n\nAn intern hovered like a dragonfly wanting water. Quinn arrived as if conjured. \u201cYou want to bomb-squad that?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou want to go get coffee,\u201d she said, steady. \u201cAnd bring it back. And then you want to sit exactly there and not talk for five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that.\u201d\n\nShe let herself listen to the sound of tape releasing as she picked at the edge. It was too neat to rip. It let go with a softness that made her throat feel strange. Inside the first layer was another box. Inside the second, a nest of paper shreds\u2014magazines cut up for confetti. She sifted. The pieces bled ink on her gloves. Her fingers found the bottom of the box and touched fabric. She lifted.\n\nA shirt, folded, used but washed until the cotton had given up remembering its own shape. Vandy colors, with a smear of turquoise at the hem like a carelessly wiped brush. She unfolded it. Someone had written in permanent marker along the inside of the collar: DANIEL P. Nice handwriting. The kind you teach yourself when you are bored in summer school, when your teacher is trying not to notice that you are practicing loops instead of listening to state capitals.\n\nThere was a note, only it wasn\u2019t paper. It was a paint chip from a hardware store, the kind that lets you hold future walls between finger and thumb. The names printed on it were ridiculous lies: Morning Lagoon, Tidepool Smile, Glassy Sky. One rectangle of color had a circle drawn around it in pen. The circle was not quite even, as if the hand had been shaking or laughing. Next to it a word: Sorry.\n\nQuinn returned and set the coffee on her desk as if he\u2019d walked in on someone sleeping. He leaned over. She showed him the shirt, the paint card.\n\n\u201cSon of a\u2014\u201d he breathed. \u201cHow did he get that? From the victim? What does sorry mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe one of those paint colors just took it too personally,\u201d she said.\n\nHe almost smiled, but then his mouth folded shut. He knew better, even this early, than to let her get away with jokes. \u201cThis is him. The guy. You think this is him?\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t answer. The name wanted to be said. It sat on her tongue like a lozenge, cooling everything. She swallowed it back into herself.\n\nShe had been a soldier once, and the Army taught that names mattered. You called the terrain by what it would do to you. You called the wind by the sand it pushed into your ears. You called your fear by something that would make sense to a sergeant you could not disappoint, like Mama or Whiskey. A man like this one, if he was a man, wanted a name because the name would put a handle on him. It would make it easier to drag him out of the river of everyone else.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go see Daniel Payne\u2019s roommates,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was late morning by the time campus let them in. Lawns sleeping under frost, squirrels not buying any of it. The dorm was an attempt at hospitality sponsored by the cold. Posters clung to cinderblock walls announcing a rally, a poetry reading, a job fair. Every face on every poster looked like it would apologize for something they hadn\u2019t done yet. A boy with glasses and a straggly mustache opened the door to Daniel\u2019s suite and immediately stepped back as if the cops had muscle memory from busting frat parties. He smelled like cheap ramen and laundry detergent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Colin,\u201d he said. He was not good at deciding where to put his hands. \u201cDanny\u2019s\u2026 I mean. Daniel. His friend. I mean, I was going to ask about him, but they sent an email that said someone would come and\u2014 Is he?.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho else is home?\u201d Dodge asked.\n\n\u201cJae\u2019s in class. Tye\u2019s sleeping. He\u2019ll pretend he\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThe room was tidy enough for boys. A plant someone definitely forgot to water had invented a new geometry to live by. The kitchen sink looked ashamed. In Daniel\u2019s room the bed was unmade in a way that suggested a quick exit, clothes heaped in the chair with a deliberateness that didn\u2019t match the bed. Posters: a band Dodge didn\u2019t recognize, a city skyline from a place he probably had never been. A strip of turquoise paint on a paper plate on the desk made her breath stutter. It was dried into a rubbery bend. Stuck to it was a blonde hair. She bagged it.\n\n\u201cDid he\u2026 was he in a relationship?\u201d she asked. The questions were always banal, and they were always not banal. \u201cDid he say he was seeing someone? Anybody leave a note, show up, call late, send too many texts? Anyone he fought with? Anyone he wanted to impress?\u201d\n\nColin pushed his glasses up in a way that made his whole face seem to wish it could be elsewhere. \u201cHe was\u2026 private, I guess. But also he really cared what people thought? I don\u2019t know. He was in this group project. He said the TA kept\u2014you know what, never mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe TA kept what?\u201d Quinn asked affably. He made himself soft on purpose, the way some people make themselves taller by wearing boots.\n\n\u201cKept, like, not answering him. He\u2019d email and email and only get a \u2018maybe\u2019 back. That\u2019s stupid. I don\u2019t know why I said it. It just\u2014he had a thing about phrasing. Like if someone said \u2018maybe\u2019 he\u2019d read it as \u2018no.\u2019 But because it was a \u2018maybe\u2019 he\u2019d try harder. Is this helping? My tongue does this thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour tongue is doing fine,\u201d Dodge said. \u201cTell me about the last time you saw him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe came in at midnight. He was on the phone. He was really quiet, which is how I know something was up because Danny could be quiet like he was going to war with himself, but this was like\u2014control. He washed his hands for forever. Then he changed his shirt and took the one he\u2019d been wearing and put it in the trash? I took it out. It wasn\u2019t like, gross-gross. It had paint on it. I was like, art project? He said yeah, sure. He didn\u2019t want to talk. He never puts stuff in the trash, though. He folds. He always folds. You know what I mean? Some people fold. His mom made him fold. He told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat color?\u201d Quinn asked.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Colin blinked.\n\n\u201cThe paint.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Blue? Not like a normal blue, though. That one that used to be on the nail polish my sister wore when she wanted to make my parents mad. You know?\u201d\n\nDodge nodded as if he had told her something useful about bridges. \u201cTurquoise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call that teal, where I\u2019m from,\u201d Colin said bravely, as though the color had insulted him personally. \u201cBut, yeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he ever talk about a Nicolas?\u201d she said, and the room gave itself a small hiccup, like something on the stove boiling for one second when it shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Colin said too fast. \u201cI don\u2019t know a Nicolas. Should I know a Nicolas? Should\u2026 um. Should I call someone? His mom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing that,\u201d she said, and then wished she had lies that were kinder. She glanced at the tiny calendar pinned to Daniel\u2019s wall. Every square full of abbreviations, test/test/test written in different pens like voices. On the day before today, a meeting circled: Skye at 8. The circle wasn\u2019t even. It wobbled as if drawn in a moving car.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s Skye?\u201d Quinn said.\n\nColin\u2019s mustache shifted with his mouth\u2019s uncertainty. \u201cI don\u2019t know. He had lots of\u2026 friends. He\u2019d meet people in weird places. Like that art store on Fifth. He liked walking there when he wanted to think.\u201d\n\nDodge knew the art store. The bell above the door sounded like a toy train panicking. The woman behind the counter had a hawk\u2019s patience and hair the color of a fresh bruise. She looked at the badge then at Dodge\u2019s face and asked if she was getting enough sleep. It was a reasonable question.\n\n\u201cDo you sell this?\u201d Dodge asked, sliding the pain chip across the counter.\n\nThe woman laughed. \u201cI have at least six brands with that shade and they all pretend they invented it. Men come in and ask me for it when Christmas is hard. Women buy it when they are leaving someone and want the walls to not take it personally. We do two-for-one on student Tuesdays. Your boy been in here lately?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich boy?\u201d Dodge asked, letting the words settle.\n\n\u201cThe kind of boy who looks like he keeps getting told he\u2019s almost there. It sits on their faces. Like a hand. They buy turquoise and charcoal pencils and say \u2018the small ones, the cheap ones.\u2019 I tell them paper is paper.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the record, how do you know he\u2019s a boy?\u201d Quinn asked, smiling his soft smile. \u201cAll kinds of folks get told \u2018almost.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d the woman said, and she did not apologize. She reached under the counter. \u201cWe keep a tab sometimes for kids who don\u2019t have cards. We\u2019re not supposed to, so don\u2019t go making me heroic. I\u2019ll check the names.\u201d She pulled a spiral-bound notebook so tortured by the back pocket it had been living in that the metal coil bowed like a wrong instrument, pages crinkled. She licked her finger and flipped. \u201cHere,\u201d she said. \u201cPayne. And\u2014hey. He wrote other names sometimes, like he was testing how letters feel. This one\u2014Nick? Nic? That was two days ago. He bought a cheap brush. He asked me what color would look good on bruises.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you said\u2014,\u201d Dodge said, feeling the cold step into her elbows and set up a chair.\n\n\u201cI told him that\u2019s a nasty question and I said peach because I wanted to see his face, and he laughed and didn\u2019t buy peach and then asked for the exact opposite of peach. He wanted to know which whites are warm, which whites are cold. He bought fixative, which is a dumb waste of money when you still breathe money. He said he was going to make something no one could miss.\u201d\n\nThey walked out with a receipt in a plastic sleeve, the small triumph of black numbers on crinkly paper. The street looked like it had been drawn with a blunt pencil. People looked like they had been drawn with a trembling hand. Dodge shifted her shoulder blades inside her coat like she could get free of something that had learned to hold her without hands.\n\n\u201cYou said his name,\u201d Quinn said on the sidewalk. \u201cBack there. You asked about Nicolas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked about a name,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNot just any name,\u201d he said gently.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about names,\u201d she said, and it came out the way you say I\u2019m not drunk when you absolutely are.\n\nWhen the day burned down to an ugly afternoon, they sat and watched the evidence do its slow trick. The lab would take longer. The lab was always a cathedral where nothing godlike happened quickly. She ate a sandwich with no taste and pretended to be human. She heard Davenport in the next cubicle practice the sentence he would say to Daniel\u2019s mother and then heard him delete it and practice a different one. If you listen you can eavesdrop on the way men try to make grief easier. They fail, and they keep trying. It\u2019s not nothing.\n\nHer phone lit. Unknown number. \u201cDetective Dodge,\u201d she said.\n\nA breath. Men have different ways of owning silence. This one breathed like he had been running and then stopped because he\u2019d seen something incredible and shouldn\u2019t share it with anyone. He was older than she\u2019d thought he would be and younger, which is another way of saying the voice didn\u2019t match the picture she didn\u2019t admit she had.\n\n\u201cI tried to be decent,\u201d he said. No hello. No I\u2019m the one. \u201cI tried to be kind about it. That\u2019s what they always say. You should be kind when you leave someone. You should be kind when you say maybe. That\u2019s the trick, right? Say maybe and they will beg you to let them give you something you didn\u2019t ask for. It\u2019s like magic but it makes your tongue dry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNicolas,\u201d she said, because she was a person with a mouth and a lifetime of uses for it.\n\n\u201cIs that me now,\u201d he said, and there was a smile the size of someone you don\u2019t want to meet in any light. Maybe it wasn\u2019t a smile. It was the feeling of having your chair pulled out from under you by a charming person who said sorry and then filmed you falling, for friends. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. Names are coats. I can wear whatever you want.\u201d\n\nShe let the phone record the silence for a second. Quinn was watching her. He was making himself into furniture. She put the call on speaker and set the phone on the desk like a bowl of milk someone wants the cats to find. \u201cDo you want to talk about Daniel Payne?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYou mean Danny,\u201d he said, and the way he said it made her hate his tongue for a second. \u201cHe was handsome in the way boys are when they\u2019re about to forget what to do with their beauty. He wanted me to see him. It\u2019s a nice thing. Being seen. You know?\u201d\n\nDodge stared at the paint card on her desk. The circle around Glassy Sky. Sorry. \u201cYou know he\u2019s dead,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s dramatic,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s colored. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s his phone?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder a bridge,\u201d he said. \u201cNext to a bottle with flowers in it. You will like how pretty it looks before you hate it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d she said. \u201cLet me see your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you think I\u2019ve earned that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s always the ways of detectives on TV. \u2018Let me look in your eyes and I\u2019ll decide if you get to be human.\u2019 I don\u2019t want to be human. You\u2019ll ruin it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\nHe considered, and when he laughed it had nothing to do with humor and all to do with the sound people make when they remember a prank they pulled on someone gullible. \u201cI want him to remember. I want them all to remember how a maybe is a no with nicer shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you maybe?\u201d\n\nHe breathed. She heard something clatter lightly on his end of the line, like a brush against a jar. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. There\u2019s a system to this. I don\u2019t just pick. I want to fix something. Rejection\u2019s an art form in this town. You\u2019re all so polite it hurts. So I decided color would be polite too, and then\u2014then no one gets to pretend they didn\u2019t see. Listen, soldier. Are you listening?\u201d\n\nHe had said soldier. It landed clean. She could feel the grit in her teeth again. The ribbon of river. Her squad leader telling her to open her mouth and breathe when the smoke got greedy. She swallowed. \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you a map,\u201d he said, and the call went dead.\n\nIt came a minute later on her email, from an address that looked like a prank. A screenshot of a pinned map. The little red drop near a public art installation by the pedestrian bridge, the kind with welded bicycles and declarations nobody reads. Quinn looked at her. She looked back. \u201cYou\u2019re making a face like you\u2019re about to sprint,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do not sprint,\u201d she said.\n\nThey went anyway, because there is a point beyond which caution becomes a kind of fraud. The afternoon had tired of trying to be cold and simply was. People moved briskly as if they could outpace a feeling. Under the bridge a bottle sat upright, as promised, flowers in it\u2014that stiff grocery-store kind that lasts forever because the water dies around them, wrapped in light blue tissue paper that had been ripped just so. Someone had stuck the bottle into a crack in the concrete. Someone had thought about angles. Next to it, a phone face-down.\n\nQuinn approached with a stick, playful because people watch, and then solemn because they don\u2019t. He flipped it. The screen was black. Dodge reached with her gloved hand. On the back, painted with care, a little circle in turquoise. The paint had bitten into the case.\n\n\u201cIs it a trap?\u201d Quinn asked. He wanted to say it. He wanted to be right about one simple thing. The word trap implies intelligence you can wrestle with. Sometimes the thing that gets you isn\u2019t a trap; it\u2019s gravity.\n\n\u201cEverything is a trap,\u201d she said to the wind, to the river, to the problem inside her own head. She put the phone in a bag.\n\nThat night she did not go home. She made deals with herself the way children bargain with dark rooms. If I finish this report, I can close my eyes in my chair for seven minutes. If I don\u2019t think the name, other bad things won\u2019t happen. She thought the name anyway, and not once, twice, a hundred\u2014Nicolas\u2014so that by the time the clock said three, it didn\u2019t look like a word anymore. It looked like a mouth open and shut.\n\nShe had wanted once to have something other than work to go home to. She had tried. The way some people try to read complicated novels. She could do it and then she couldn\u2019t. When a man said maybe she didn\u2019t know how to leave him his word, she wanted to pure push him toward one thing, yes or no. The Army had taught her the neat trick of living with a plan and a backup plan and a map in your leg. Nashville had taught her that maps are suggestions at best, at worst lies told by a printer trying to be useful. In between was the man on the phone and his paint and the way he had said soldier like he had been there, like the smell of burning oil was just a memory of a candle.\n\nAround four, when the office had gone to that hollow quiet that leaves even the coffee looking pinched, she went to the bathroom and stared at herself. Skewed ponytail. Lips like she\u2019d been biting them, which she had. The mirror had a chip at the bottom where someone had set it down too hard years ago. It held onto the missing piece like a grudge. She washed her hands, not because they were dirty but because she wanted the sting of water. When she looked down she saw it: a smear of turquoise at her wrist, right where people wear watches when they want to be on time for their own excuses.\n\nShe didn\u2019t remember touching paint. She scrubbed. It didn\u2019t come off immediately. She rubbed until her skin complained and then it peeled, reluctantly, leaving a doubt behind. She could not tell if she was washing the color away or a bruise of coincidence.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Quinn said softly. He had come to the doorway without knocking. \u201cI think I found where the phone\u2019s been. There\u2019s a bus stop camera. Do you want to\u2014 You okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeach,\u201d she said.\n\nHe blinked. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nShe shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d She dried her wrist thoroughly, the way you do when you want to lie to a wound.\n\nThey watched the footage in a room that smelled like cheap carpet and old gum. A man in a gray hoodie had put the phone under the bridge. He was careful. He\u2019s always careful, she thought. He is somewhere between tall and not tall. He wore a cap, yes. He had the slump of someone who\u2019d lost something early and kept trying to stand up straighter but could only do it when no one was looking. He looked, in other words, like everyone. He had put the phone down, the bottle, stepped back, stood and watched his offering to the god of incidental passerby, as if he wanted witness. Then he vanished at the edge of the frame, like he belonged to the part of the world that cameras can\u2019t sing.\n\n\u201cFreeze it,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cCan we enhance, make him taller?\u201d\n\nShe laughed, and the sound came out like someone else\u2019s shoe. \u201cWe don\u2019t get to enhance reality, Quinn.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sure? Because that sounds like a nice trick.\u201d\n\nIn the quiet before morning she called her mother. It went to voicemail. Her mother kept the same message she\u2019d recorded ten years ago, the one that made her voice sound like a tin can tied to a back bumper. Hi it\u2019s Lorene. Leave it clean. Dodge listened to the sound of who she had been when she was too young to be anyone and then hung up without speaking. Sometimes not saying what you feel is a kindness. Sometimes it\u2019s simply not knowing which words will combust.\n\nShe fell asleep in the chair. She dreamed of the paint aisle at the hardware store, the little cards like stamps, like whale-tails, like all the ways a person could live if they could just decide. Nicolas pushed a cart past her, wheels squealing like they had opinions. He wore a shirt with someone else\u2019s name on it. He stopped and took a card and swallowed it. He took another and tucked it in her sleeve. He did not look at her face but at her wrists. He said, in the dream, sorry, as if teaching a child a magic word. She woke with her fist clenched and the name in her mouth like candy she hadn\u2019t meant to steal.\n\nWhen the morning nametag changed on the city, when the sun pretended to be new, the lab sent a tiny miracle: a match to a brand of art paint more expensive than a student would choose, more specific than a house painter would bother with. They sent the formula, the pigment concentrations, the fancy word ethereal that the company insisted on in its catalog copy. A list of retailers. The one on Fifth. A whisper of a paint seller online who would ship no questions asked, wrapped like contraband, in boxes meant for books.\n\nThe ME had more to say now that Daniel\u2019s body had had one more night of listening to the cold. Unremarkable contusions on the back of the head, consistent with a shove, a fall, not with a rage. No obvious asphyxiation but a suggestion. A shade of suggestion, as if life had been invited to leave with kind fingers, not yanked out with fury. No sexual assault. Paint entered cracks of skin, papercuts, a hangnail. The brush used had been a narrow flat, synthetic fibers. Green-blue residue at the base of the nail of his right thumb. He had been held by someone who knew how to hold.\n\nThey were learning not much and everything. They were learning style. They were learning patience. They were learning that this person would make a choreograph of his crimes, at least the part after the part that mattered\u2014the part that left someone no longer an actor in the scene of themselves\u2014so that he could have one pure thing: the delight of arranging, of watching the city be forced to admit to color.\n\nDodge drove at noon, because she couldn\u2019t not. The art store again. The hardware store on the bad side of pretty where the old men sucked their teeth and told the cashiers how they would do it if they were in charge. She bought a small bottle of the color. She put it on the passenger seat and buckled it in. She drove to the river and sat where the first body had been, only now the ground had been washed by men who scrub for a living, and the weeds had grown arrogant in one night in that way weeds do\u2014their life is a shout.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to see,\u201d she asked no one, and someone answered in the shape of a shadow cast by her own head across the rock, the way it made a little theater. She closed her eyes and saw a turquoise ribbon pulled through a ring the way sailors show knots to children. She saw the knuckles of a man flexing as he paints around a nipple with decency, like he was letting the body keep its small secrets. She saw a word written on the inside of her skull in handwriting too clean and that word was maybe.\n\nHer phone rang. The voice was calm and had been waiting for her. \u201cYou\u2019re so close to falling in,\u201d he said. \u201cYou keep standing at the edge like that. One little push, and you\u2019re swimming. Do you like it. The color.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gaudy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s amateur hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cNecessary,\u201d he said. \u201cNecessary is not always pretty. Ask a surgeon.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to imagine him in this city as she spoke. She wanted to tilt her head and see in the corner of her eye a man on a bench pretending to be about to cry. She wanted the cage of him solid. But the voice was coming from the part of the day no one owns, and her head hurt with the way the river stood its ground.\n\n\u201cWho is Skye,\u201d she asked.\n\nHe said nothing for the count of three Mississippi. \u201cSkye,\u201d he said, tasting it, like he was learning to pronounce a friend\u2019s name in a foreign language. \u201cSkye matters. Skye tells the weather how to behave. He\u2014no. She. See what language does? She gave me a word once and I folded it up and put it in my mouth and sucked on it until it disappeared. It tasted like copper.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou killed Daniel,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cLanguage again,\u201d he said, and the smile was back, sweet and dumb and arrogant. \u201cI made him stop. There\u2019s a difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhere you always are, soldier. Under bridges. On the edge of things. Breathing hard so you can hear yourself exist. It won\u2019t help you. I am everywhere that \u2018maybe\u2019 lives. It\u2019s a gorgeous country. We have mountains.\u201d\n\nThe line dropped. It had never been a line. It had been a piece of string a child uses to make a cat\u2019s cradle, and then hands that drop it, and then laughter that says it doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nBack at the office the walls seemed an inch closer than they had last week. The plant on the windowsill had resurrected in her absence, which meant someone else had watered it, which meant kindness could be anonymous and not demand repayment, which meant she could stand it again for five minutes. Quinn sat with his feet not quite touching the floor, a grown man trying to make himself smaller out of respect, or fear, or because he\u2019d learned from someone that women give more truth when you don\u2019t loom.\n\n\u201cYou think Daniel paints,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPainted,\u201d she corrected without kindness. \u201cYes. No. He let himself be painted. That\u2019s different.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think the killer is\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he knows how to make a brush\u2019s edge look like it didn\u2019t get there by accident,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see the pores on his shoulder where the paint pooled? He went slow. He was not angry. Rage doesn\u2019t go slow. He thought he was doing a service. He thinks he has a point, Quinn, which is worse than the other kind. And he\u2014\u201d She stopped because there it was again, the smear on her wrist, ghost of a color she\u2019d washed away. She had not put her hands in the paint. She had not leaned against the bag where the phone was sleeping. She had not\u2014\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d Quinn asked.\n\n\u201cI need a shower,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou and me both,\u201d he said.\n\nShe went to the locker room and leaned against tile and let the water slap at her shoulders until she felt scraped and honest. She put her forehead against the cool wall. She thought about the way she used to stand in showers on bases a half-world away, the way the pipes rattled like old men in a church basement, the way the water smelled brackish and clean at the same time. She thought about the boy\u2019s eyelashes with beads of paint on them. She thought about the smile in the man\u2019s voice and the way it made him seem like someone she\u2019d known in a line, waiting for a signature, the way boredom makes friends out of strangers. She thought about a story she had told herself about being competent, and how competence was a coat that eventually smells like smoke.\n\nWhen she stepped out, a towel around her, her phone was buzzing on the bench. A text from an unknown number. A picture. Her car, parked by the river where she had sat. On the hood, a single handprint. Turquoise. The fingers long. The thumb set a little far from the rest, like a man who had learned to use tools with his left hand because someone had insisted that right was right.\n\nShe did not call Quinn. She stood with the towel and let herself not think for the space of three breaths. Then she pulled on clothes with the efficiency of a person who learned young how to be ready faster than someone could yell orders. She walked to her car and the handprint was exactly where the picture had said it would be, and the paint was wet.\n\nThe river said hey hey hey and the wind said nothing and she put her hand, just for a second, almost in the place where his had been, and she told herself not to, and she did anyway. She lifted her fingers. The color held. She rubbed it with her thumb. It gave off a smell that made her mouth flood, like something candied and chemical, like holidays that happen in houses where you know better than to go.\n\nShe went home finally, because even detective work is a kind of endocrine system that can only pump so long without recalibrating. She fed the cat that had adopted her after someone left town, a fat orange politician with the name Plank. She stood at the sink and let the tap run cool as if she could drain her head that way, let the city\u2019s pipes hum to her, the voice of a thing that exists only to keep people from noticing what it does. The news was on because she didn\u2019t turn it off. They were talking about a sculpture downtown with a new coat of paint, a prank, teenagers probably. The sculpture had been painted the wrong color, the anchor chains made ocean where they should be iron. The camera loved the guy in a beanie who said art is for everyone. The camera didn\u2019t love the fact that the anchor chain looked like a bracelet on the city\u2019s wrist.\n\nShe slept. She dreamed a harmless dream about breakfast. She woke with her mouth full of the taste of copper and a word she didn\u2019t speak even in the empty room.\n\nIn the morning, before the sky had decided what to be, she drove to a field where they used to run drills, zigzag cones yelling at you usually in winter because that\u2019s when budgets remember you. She ran between them until the hate in her calves unclenched. She stopped on the far side and bent double and touched the ground because she had promised herself that whenever she forgot how to be here she would touch this, this dirt, this ugly useful earth, until it told her there were worse things than the voice of a man who thinks he has invented color.\n\nWhen she stood, he was standing by the bleachers, hands in the pockets of a coat that wished it were new and wasn\u2019t. He was neither tall nor short and his face was one of those that on some days looks like the lead boy in a school play and on others the kid who holds up a tree and says he\u2019s an actor too. He lifted one hand as if asking a question in class. He was married to the city, she thought. He had that look: people who stay after everyone else leaves and hold the door for you and then step aside and watch you go.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to be here,\u201d she said, and the wind took her words and threw them on the ground and laughed.\n\n\u201cNeither are you,\u201d he said, and if she had closed her eyes she might have heard him without his mouth.\n\nShe took a step. He took a step back and smiled and it was not a threat, not exactly, but the same feeling you have when you see a child on a railing. \u201cSorry,\u201d he said, and she wanted to slap the word off his tongue and tell it to be better than itself. \u201cI was out of paint. Thought I\u2019d come find more.\u201d He lifted his hands and she saw that they were clean. She understood suddenly and with a heat that made her skin feel too tight: the paint on her wrist, the handprint on her car, the phone under the bridge\u2014all of it like a schoolboy flicking notes, the pleasure of getting away with it.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want me to call you,\u201d she said because she had to keep him speaking.\n\nHe shrugged. His coat made a small sound like a page turning. \u201cNames are for later. Or never. You\u2019ll make one up anyway and then you\u2019ll put it on the news and then mothers will say it like a curse to their children. Keep your room clean or Nicolas will come in the night and color your shoes. I don\u2019t want that life.\u201d\n\n\u201cNicolas,\u201d she repeated, and it looked wrong in the air on this field. It looked like a coin you toss and it lands on its edge. \u201cWhy turquoise.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s the color of apology,\u201d he said, delighted with himself, and then his face did a thing, a small fall like someone tripping over an invisible shoelace. \u201cBecause it\u2019s the color that makes white want to be honest. Because it\u2019s halfway to green but doesn\u2019t know how to arrive. Because a girl named Skye once said it made my eyes look like I knew where I was going, and then she said maybe, and then she said not now, and then she said I\u2019m sorry, and then she said can we still be\u2014 and I told her that sorry is a ribbon you tie on a gift you were never going to give.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou killed Daniel,\u201d she said again, because the field, the cones, the way her calves had loosened\u2014it all felt like a song that has lost its words.\n\n\u201cI painted him,\u201d he said, and the last thing he said before he turned his face to the wind was almost tender. \u201cHe asked me to.\u201d\n\nHe moved. Not fast. Not the way television goes. He simply figured out where to be where she was not, and then he let distance be a magician for him. He walked behind the bleachers and was not there, and then was somewhere else, and then the wind told her she had missed the only trick. She did not pull her weapon because there was nothing to shoot that would solve falling.\n\nShe stood there and the cones looked at her like little witnesses and the sky decided on a kind of gray that would not explain itself. Her phone went off. A text. Another picture. A wall this time, a modest brick wall somewhere she did not immediately recognize, the kind that keeps weeds from forgetting themselves. Painted on it in letters careful as stitches: HE SAID MAYBE. Painted in turquoise. Underneath, in smaller hand, like a whisper: Sorry.\n\nThe city would wake and see it. It would say teenagers again. It would say art is for everyone again. It would say maybe and then it would go to work.\n\nShe walked back to the car and sat, and she held the bottle of paint she had bought in her hand like an egg, and she felt the weight of colors she didn\u2019t choose. When she turned the key, the engine made the little cough that meant maybe and then it caught and said yes, and she drove toward the wall that did not know it had become a message. In the rearview mirror, the field lay like a promise that needed more words to hold steady. Her mouth formed a name without sound and the name looked wrong and then it looked right and then it became just a shape.\n\nShe would catch him, she thought. Or she would catch herself catching him. Or she would catch the river and make it say one thing for once. She wanted something singular in a world made of maybes. She tightened her hands on the wheel and the smear of color on her wrist was gone because she had scrubbed it but not gone because nothing was gone in this city; it was merely painted over with something we could all stand to look at. She drove and did not blink because if she blinked she would have to decide what to make of the handprint and the phone and the boy and the way she had seen, in that field, a face that could be anyone\u2019s and had decided it was one person and given him a coat of the only word she had left.",

Morning figured itself out in increments, the light unspooling over brick and chain link and the backs of buildings that had given up on trying to be anything but backs, and people arrived the way birds do\u2014first one, then a few more, then suddenly there were too many and you couldn\u2019t identify the one that mattered. Patrol strung tape and practiced their palm-out move that kept strollers and dogs and men in fleece vests at a theatrical distance. The turquoise did its trick in this light, saturated and sugared, the letters careful, the message personal and loud enough to carry over traffic: HE SAID MAYBE. The paint hadn\u2019t dripped. Whoever had put it there had waited for the right humidity or learned patience by failing at painting enough to know when a wall will take what you give it. Below, in a quieter hand made for secrets and notes pinned under pillows: Sorry.\n\nDodge stood too close and then backed up because old brick wants to hold your skin. Her winter breath made a small ghost and that small ghost practiced hanging around and not being seen. The city had peeled itself down to the essentials overnight and put them on this spot as if it could point and say here, this, fix this part and watch everything else behave. A tech was on one knee, scooping chips that fell to her sheet of paper with the care of someone harvesting basil. The smell was fainter than by the river\u2014cold eats the smell out of paint\u2014but under it she could still hear the thinner and that chemical candy, the note from a catalog promising that if you bought enough of this you would belong to a gentler version of your life.\n\nShe let herself look at the edges. The lines weren\u2019t masked off; no tape had given them that glass-bottle crispness, which meant a steady hand and a practice wall somewhere else where the stakes were lower and his heart beat differently. The curve on the y in maybe had weight it didn\u2019t need and there was the little wishbone mistake where a left hand corrects itself in a hurry. She could see where he\u2019d held the brush up and away once, a dot of turquoise like a star, not part of the text but all of it at the same time, a painter\u2019s automatic exhale. She could see where someone had painted over old tags a hundred times and where this layer chose to ignore those ghosts. The city was a palimpsest, her father would have said if he\u2019d ever learned the word, but he hadn\u2019t and he would have just called it stubborn.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re calling it vandalism,\u201d Quinn said at her shoulder, voice made of coffee and the way his scarf liked to climb his neck, city morning in his bowl. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to say graffiti like it\u2019s a teenager with hurt feelings. You want me to do media? Or you want to make them like you for once.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave I been doing it wrong,\u201d she asked, steady, and saw the corner of his mouth tilt because he knew better than to believe she didn\u2019t enjoy it when the cameras met her and then flinched and then tried again, like birds with a window they can\u2019t understand. \u201cWhat did the canvass get you.\u201d\n\n\u201cA woman with a dachshund named Sergeant who swears she saw him at four forty, average build, not tall not short, cap, hoodie,\u201d he said, making those words lean on each other as if they could stand up into a man. \u201cGuy on a bike who says he slowed and asked if the city had hired someone to brighten things up. Painter didn\u2019t look up, just said it was practice. I like that one. He sounded proud of himself, like the sentence had been waiting.\u201d\n\nThe tech made a small noise\u2014not a finding, not yet, just the body being careful. Dodge crouched and planted one flat palm on her thigh to keep the world from tilting. Under the new paint the wall wore old weather, freckles of soot, the blush from a former fire that hadn\u2019t been sufficient to change the story. In the corner near the base where brick met weedy ground there was a crevice someone had offered cigarette butts to all summer. She tipped a stick in, fished something up slow. Glossed cardstock scraped with grit, the edge turquoise-stained where someone set it down careless and lifted it too soon. She held it by the corner and turned it. The card meant itself to be an appointment reminder; it had a dentist\u2019s jawline smile printed in faded ink. Across the clean side, in a hand she\u2019d seen twice now, all those loops that refused to be round, it read: SORRY LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.\n\nQuinn read it and went paler in that bowl-eyed way of his that made people hand him cookies. \u201cHe\u2019s writing to us now,\u201d he said. \u201cOr to the city. Or to himself, out loud.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s writing to anyone who\u2019s ever said maybe,\u201d she said, and it sounded too wide, sounded like something you can\u2019t get your arms around. She passed the card to the tech and the tech labelled it in neat block letters, the kind of handwriting that belongs to people who think one thing in their lives should stay simple.\n\nA girl with a sketchbook had got too close to the tape and then made her body smaller so that the tape looked like it had moved to accommodate her. She wore a coat three sizes too big, thrift-store wool that made a sound like a moth chewing when she shifted. Her pencil moved fast, catching the point of the y and the wrongness of the a where it leaned toward the means what is said. She had drawn Dodge without looking at her, which is a gift or a crime, depending on who receives it. Dodge walked over anyway because pencil marks sometimes catch what cameras don\u2019t. The girl did not look up; she consummated her line and then shaded the inside of sorry like she had seen a picture of an eclipse and wanted to live inside it.\n\n\u201cYou see anything,\u201d Dodge asked, gentle because college kids always think they\u2019re getting in trouble when a badge says hello.\n\nThe girl kept drawing, the pencil making a sound like dry rain. \u201cSaw a guy painting when I walked by. I thought it was for a festival. People don\u2019t get mad when it\u2019s for a festival. He had the wrong shoes for working outside. Leather that squeaked if he turned too fast, like old theater seats.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeft-handed,\u201d Dodge said, not exactly a question.\n\nThe girl smiled without letting it break her face open. \u201cYou saw the flourish,\u201d she said, and let the pencil make one around the y. \u201cMy professor says it\u2019s a tell when people think they\u2019re closing a circle, which is most of us. He mixed on his palm. You could tell he kept tapping the brush against his hand because he had turquoise here.\u201d She touched the heel of her hand, the pad below the little finger, and spread her fingers like a starfish. \u201cHe kept looking behind him, but not like he was scared someone would stop him. Like he was hoping they\u2019d try. He wanted to talk about it. That\u2019s a weird thing to want.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he say anything to you,\u201d Dodge asked.\n\n\u201cJust good morning, but he didn\u2019t look at me when he said it. He looked at the wall, like the wall was the one talking back,\u201d the girl said. She added a shadow down the side of the H and then, because she was kind, turned the sketchbook so Dodge could see. \u201cHe might come back, though. You know how some people are with their work. They can\u2019t leave it alone. There\u2019s this thing about symmetry. He doesn\u2019t have it. He\u2019ll want to.\u201d\n\nAfter the prints and the chips and the card got their little bags and the wall got its new life, media asked her for a sound bite big enough to put under a picture of someone\u2019s breakfast. \u201cDo you consider this a message from the perpetrator,\u201d a woman in a hat that wanted to be more important than it was asked. Dodge said it could be and could not be and that the department was pursuing all leads and thanked the citizens of Nashville for their vigilance like it was a business transaction. She smiled with all her teeth and imagined the killer at home, wherever that was, watching and grading her on her posture. You\u2019re an A when you don\u2019t blink, soldier, he would say, and then he would prefer if she failed.\n\nShe and Quinn stood with their coffee on the sidewalk when it was over and watched the city's face look at itself. \u201cSkye,\u201d he said, not looking up from the steam rising out of his cup like a mistake. \u201cIt keeps getting more gravitational. I called the registrar and played nice and they pretended they wanted to help me because they liked my phone voice. There\u2019s a Skye in Visual Arts\u2014Skye Delaney\u2014adjunct, projects on public practice, does those pop-up critique nights at a space called the Livery. Runs on donations and the fact that no one has torn it down yet. Our boy\u2019s calendar circled Skye at eight. The Livery had a session last night. That tracks. There\u2019s also a Skye in Counseling, Skye Benning, but she works eight to five and the meet-ups on her schedule are named and medicated. Which one you want to annoy first.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d she said, and touched the corner of the card in her pocket like a charm she didn\u2019t want to believe in. \u201cStart with the one he went to. The Livery. Everybody pretends nothing is urgent until a thing is. Art people are better at saying the urgent thing without moving their mouths.\u201d\n\nThe Livery was the kind of building people used to use to keep animals dry and now used to keep secrets respectable. Tall doors, paint peeling away in strips that wanted to call themselves river. Inside, the cold lived like it was paying rent. Metal folding chairs made little steel tongues of noise when you moved them and a row of clip lights tried too hard on a wire. On a table at the back were cookies turned to stone and a kettle that had learned to boil on sighs. The boards on the floor announced where anyone heavier than a thought stepped. Someone had written on the chalkboard a quote about failure and then someone else had added a longer, ruder sentence about failure\u2019s mother. Students in hats wore their insecurity like fashion. The woman who owned the room in the way you own a storm when you know the clouds by name had a head of hair bleached to that color between new page and regret and a line of tattoos up one arm that read like a sentence. Skye Delaney was older than the kids and younger than the professors, the band of the woman who has discovered where she stands and is building a deck there.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re interrupting my office hours without an office,\u201d she said when Dodge showed her the badge, and her smile made the word cop look like a different word you only use with friends. \u201cHeard about your wall. It\u2019s pretty. People will get mad it\u2019s pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaniel Payne circled you on his calendar,\u201d Dodge said. \u201cEight o\u2019clock last night.\u201d\n\nSkye\u2019s face did not fall and did not change and did what good faces do when they need to hold a thing and not drop it. She nodded like a person nods when offered a cup she didn\u2019t order. \u201cHe was here. He\u2019s been coming Wednesdays when he can. He shows up hungry for it and leaves like someone has fed him and also punched him, which is critique. He likes clarity. The problem with the word maybe is that it invites interpretation and he wants the kind of answer that has a porch light,\u201d she said, and picked up a piece of chalk and set it down again. \u201cIs he\u2014 Have you told\u2014 Is someone\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re telling people,\u201d Quinn said carefully, looking suddenly very, very young. \u201cWe are telling his mother. We are telling you because your name is on a circle. We need to know who talked to him last. Who he talked about. He had paint on his shirt. He put it in a trash can like he doesn\u2019t do that. He went quiet when he shouldn\u2019t have. He is painted now. Do you know why.\u201d\n\nSkye\u2019s mouth made a line that could be mistaken for a horizon. \u201cHe was trying out something. He called it performance because it\u2019s safer to do the scary thing if you put a frame on it. He found someone to paint on him. He said it made him feel seen in the way naked doesn\u2019t, which, good for him. I told him to have a buddy and a safe word and to email me when he got home because I have a list of students I worry about in rotation like bedside charts. I said be careful with solvents and skin and he said he\u2019d researched. I said I don\u2019t like \u2018researched\u2019 when I can\u2019t see the footnotes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was blushing when he said it. Blushing is a good sign in boys. It means they might not hurt you. That\u2019s not science. It\u2019s fieldwork.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know a Nicolas,\u201d Dodge asked. She did not let her voice do anything. She kept it where it was supposed to be, on the line that meant ordinary question.\n\nSkye turned her wrist so that the tattoos along it\u2014arrows, a compass, the word boundary in a typewriter font\u2014shifted. She looked past Dodge for a second and then back, and in that second Dodge understood there were people for whom the memory of a person arrives with the weight of a stone in a pocket you forgot you put there. \u201cI knew a Nick,\u201d she said finally. \u201cIf you say Nicolas you sound like the principal. He was around here a couple of years ago when we still had a budget to pretend to be a community. That was dumb and brave. He came to critique and made everybody draw their hands without looking and then cried because he didn\u2019t know how to talk about the difference between intention and impact and I told him that was the beginning of his education. He always smelled like laundry done at someone else\u2019s house. He wanted to date the idea of me and I told him maybe because I wasn\u2019t\u2014that word. I needed to not be in anyone\u2019s project for a while. I taught him to make gesso and he taught me that some men will turn your maybe into scaffolding and climb it,\u201d she said, and leaned back against her desk, palms on wood, rings shining dull. \u201cHe showed up for a while and then he showed up less and then he stopped. He sent me a link once to a video of someone painting a body for a runway show and said this is art if fashion says it is and I wrote back and said this is art if consent says it is and he didn\u2019t write back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou tell Daniel that,\u201d Dodge asked. Consent like a word the room could hold. She looked at the floorboards and how they bowed with the memory of too many feet.\n\n\u201cI told Daniel everything a person can tell another person without taking the brush out of his hand,\u201d Skye said. \u201cHe was excited and also scared, which is the only honest way to make something. He said the painter liked turquoise. I told him everybody\u2019s an ocean until they have to clean the sink. He laughed. He did that thing with his face like he thinks he might be loved if he does it right. That\u2019s the face that gets me every time. I told him one day I would ban the word maybe. I say that a lot. My kids\u2014\u201d and she waved her hand at empty chairs and half-finished canvases and the silhouette of a person drawn in tape on the floor\u2014 \u201cthey are all just a chorus of maybes. It\u2019s a project city. Everything is about to be something.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid Nicolas come here last night,\u201d Quinn asked. \u201cIs he part of your scene now. He likes our wall.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wall is a sentence,\u201d Skye said, and in the way she said it Dodge heard a tired love for the city that made excuses for itself. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t here. If he was, I would have put a chair between us so I could sit in it. Users and abusers come in looking like hungry and if you\u2019re not careful you think you can feed them. I don\u2019t feed men like that anymore,\u201d she said, and softened because she had said something hard. \u201cIf this is your man, he wears grief like a varsity jacket. He wants people to look. He learned to do that with us. Art is where you trial run your crimes. That\u2019s a shitty sentence to say out loud, but most people use it to learn how to be better humans. Some people, though, go home and cut their crime out of cardboard to see if it fits in a box.\u201d\n\nDodge took a breath that felt like lifting something heavy off a high shelf. \u201cWe\u2019ll need names. People who were here last night. Anyone who would know where Daniel went after. Anyone who would vouch. Anyone Nicolas might have used for a mirror.\u201d\n\nSkye nodded. She had a list without looking. She recited names and numbers and handles that sounded like small animals, and when she said Colin\u2019s name and then Tye\u2019s, already in Dodge\u2019s book, she added a third\u2014a Jae who folded paper cranes and told new participants to keep their hands off the glue gun like a joke. \u201cIf you talk to my kids, you talk to them like you know they deserve to be here,\u201d she said. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019ll write a letter and put it on the radio.\u201d\n\nQuinn smiled like that actually scared him in a small way. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d he said, and it made the room warmer. It made Skye forgive him for existing.\n\nThey left with a flurry of names and the sense that the cold had opinions. Outside the air had decided on bright and brittle. Dodge unlocked the car and paused because the sight of the handprint had been burned into the back of her eyes and memory is a lazy beast. It wasn\u2019t there now; her hood was clean save for dust and a scar in the paint from when a branch had tried to be more tree than it was. She held the picture up on her phone like a child comparing stickers to a sheet. The print sat there, five long fingers radiating from the heel, where he mixed the paint on his own skin, left hand, yes, thumb a little off because of the old injury he would tell a woman he wanted to sleep with came from shop class, a truth he told like a lie. Quinn looked at the picture and then at the hood and did a small thing with his mouth like a hinge thinking about itself.\n\n\u201cYou tell me last night,\u201d he said. He made it not a reprimand, made it a hand held out, palm up, you can put what you want in here and I won\u2019t close it on you.\n\nShe told him something like the truth. She told him she\u2019d come down to the garage and it had been there and she had bagged a swab off the edge because hope is a disease, and she told him about the text with the picture taken half a beat before she arrived as if the man had walked backward away from the car, phone up, whistling. His hand went to his pocket the way men do when they want to put something in their hands they can fix. He took it away empty.\n\n\u201cHe is in your yard,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cHe is leaving you a toy. He is not flirting with you. He is escalating. Do we want to talk about protective detail or do you want to use the word no on me right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, sharp, and then softened because he had earned better. \u201cI will not go home the same way twice. I will tell you the parts I don\u2019t want to. You will not look at me like you\u2019re sorry because I have already been looked at like that enough and it makes people do stupid things,\u201d she said, and it did something to him; it made him human and not teammate for a second, made him show the way he had been trained to put himself away.\n\nThey sent the handprint photo to the lab and Rhea, who wore her hair in a braid like a rope she could tie herself to something with, wrote back with a kissy face and a promise and the line give me two hours and your favorite donuts. They sent the wall samples and the new card and kept the receipt from the art store in its sleeve like a holy thing. The lab would pull binder and pigment ratios apart until they sang their little chemical song. The bus camera was feeding footage now, and in the blue-light room where reality goes to be argued with they watched the man in gray again, watched the way he didn\u2019t hurry and didn\u2019t slow, watched the little three-inch habit in the swing of his left arm that people get when they\u2019ve had to carry weight there too long. He put the bottle down like he was giving it a good home. He stepped back and admired his own correctness and then he was gone, into that corner of the frame where your life always walks off to if you let it.\n\n\u201cSkye Benning,\u201d Dodge said, late in the day when the body makes a liar out of your ambition, and they walked across campus to a building that wanted to be wood and was eleven kinds of plastic. Student Wellness had couches that looked like snacks and a bulletin board dressed up in emojis. The receptionist smiled with her whole face because she had been hired to. Skye Benning came to get them with the kindness of someone who spends her days practicing being a person you can tell the truth to. She was small and fortressed in a cardigan and her nametag made a low-grade noise against her lanyard. Her office had the good tissues and a plant that had been watered recently with faith. She sat without closing herself behind a desk because desks are policies wearing suits.\n\n\u201cDaniel Payne,\u201d Dodge said, and watched the woman put her hands in her lap so she wouldn\u2019t reach up and touch her own face.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve met,\u201d Skye Benning said. Her voice was not soft, it was exact. \u201cHe is\u2014 He was\u2014 He is a client. I say \u2018is\u2019 because what we do here exists outside of his body and in it at the same time and the tense is an argument I lose when we are done. I can\u2019t tell you what we talked about. I can tell you it was Wednesdays at eight because that is public information, the door and the logs and the fact of his feet. I can tell you he wanted to be okay and that\u2019s not a bad start,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking for the inside of him,\u201d Quinn said, which was a lie, because police always ask for that without asking, they stare at the couch to see if it remembers, at the window to see if it watched. \u201cWe\u2019re asking who waited for him when he left. We\u2019re asking if anybody walked him to the door more than once. We\u2019re asking who sits out there pretending to scroll and listens through this wall. We\u2019re asking if anyone said maybe and got to turn that into a life\u2019s project.\u201d\n\nSkye Benning smiled the smile of a person who sees the whole thing and can do nothing about that. \u201cYou want to know about Nicolas,\u201d she said, and it was not a question. \u201cI have a man who likes my lobby. He likes my hours. He has discovered that if he shows up and uses the coffee machine and sits on the edge of that blue chair,\u201d she pointed, and Dodge looked and it was blue in the way dentists paint rooms, \u201cthat he can be near something soft. He does not meet with me. He insists he has no appointment. He uses a different name each week, as if he is trying them on. I tell him the chair is for clients and he says I am a client and I say not here and he says maybe and he says sorry in the way that boys say it when they think the word is a charm,\u201d she said, and the plant leaf trembled in her office as if to underline the sentence. \u201cHe came last night. Sat long enough to be counted by a building. Watched Daniel leave. I told him to get out and he left. I am tired of maybe. I am going to write a book. Do you want to arrest me for being tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat name,\u201d Dodge asked, and her pulse had discovered a drum it wanted.\n\n\u201cNick, Nico, Cole, once he tried \u2018Blue\u2019 and I laughed and he looked like a dog who doesn\u2019t get the joke,\u201d Skye said. \u201cHe is average. He is the lab-grown diamond of men. He is a salesman\u2019s son. He smells like something that used to be wealth. I can show you the camera footage of the lobby because my boss likes the feeling of control.\u201d\n\nThey watched him. The lobby camera was kinder than the bus one, closer, full of the little things people don\u2019t notice they do. He came in, cap low, hoodie, left hand scuffed with paint if you knew what to look for, the thumb bent away a fraction, soft old scar crossing the knuckle like the letter X. He poured coffee and spilled and cleaned the spill with competence like it shamed him to do it badly. He sat in the chair and looked at the door the way people look at doors when their idea of love is a hallway that keeps ending. He watched Daniel leave with his shoulders. He didn\u2019t get up. He didn\u2019t follow. A minute later he did. He stood at the lobby\u2019s edge and held himself like a fence. He waited until Daniel was down the hall and then he walked, left hand in pocket like it was the thing that needed to be hidden.\n\n\u201cTime stamp,\u201d Quinn said, because it made him feel like a man with a hammer in a world full of nails. They wrote it. They pinned it to the map of Daniel\u2019s last hour. They felt a piece slide into place and it did not make a picture yet.\n\nWhen the day got old enough to be honest, Rhea called. \u201cHandprint paint is your fancy brand,\u201d she said, cheerful as a bartender. \u201cThat specific turquoise, that same binder, micro-scratch pattern on the brush stroke that says synthetic flat, one bristle at the corner flares a little like a cowlick\u2014maybe you\u2019ll find that brush and it will be your glass slipper. More fun: latent ridge detail in the handprint. Turquoise is sticky in all the ways that matter. You\u2019ve got ridges on the distal phalanges of index and middle. They\u2019re partials but good. I can make you art out of them. You get me a suspect, I\u2019ll tell you whether his hands have been places.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re magic,\u201d Dodge said, and Rhea laughed through her nose.\n\n\u201cDonuts. Maple glaze. I like the ones with bacon. Don\u2019t name it. Don\u2019t let it name you,\u201d she said, and hung up humming.\n\nBy seven the city had chosen its night face, slick and wanting. They drove past the wall again and someone had left candles that would gutter out in the wind and that didn\u2019t matter because leaving them made a small muscle in the chest feel better. Someone had taped flowers to the brick and the brick drank the cold out of their stems. The turquoise was deeper now that the day had decided to quit. A couple in matching fleece kissed under the word maybe and took a picture and would one day look at it and call it fate. A kid in a patched jacket traced the letters with a finger he had dipped in sugar from a donut bag and left a snail trail of stick across the bottom of the b. The city was learning a new vocabulary whether it wanted to or not.\n\nAt her desk, Dodge opened Daniel\u2019s phone. Rhea had coaxed it to speak and now it sat there, a rectangle full of almosts. Texts came like a prayer wheel. Colin about ramen. A sister about sending a picture of a dog in a sweater. A mother about a box of oranges because that is how some mothers keep the world at bay. A number unlisted, not saved, bubbles in gray and blue. The last string began the day before yesterday and read like a tightrope. You said maybe, he wrote. Not no, he wrote. Maybe is hope, he wrote. The gray bubbles answered. Makes it your decision but not my fault, the gray wrote. That\u2019s the way of maybe, the gray wrote. I don\u2019t want to break anything in you, the gray wrote. The blue answered fast. You can\u2019t break anything, the blue lied. You just look and then I\u2019m better, the blue wrote. There was a picture in the string, skin and a mark in turquoise where a brush had drawn a line over a hipbone like a coastline. There was a single word after, the gray wrote: Sorry.\n\nRhea pinged an associated account for the number. It hid under a prepaid cloud and lived there like fog. But the phone in the lobby behind the Wellness Center had spit out a text at the same minute the gray bubble did and the internal logs gave them a handmade map: their man leaned against a vending machine to borrow a signal, typed out his sentence, watched it deliver and then went to see if the sorry had worked on a heart. The building gave them the story it could and then ran out of nouns. It had nothing to say about bridges or rivers or walls.\n\n\u201cI want him in a room,\u201d Quinn said, and his hand had found his gun without taking it out, the way men check their own pulse.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get him,\u201d Dodge said, and it was not hope and it was not a promise. It was something a soldier says when she has a field to cross and the field has an edge.\n\nShe drove home by streets that tried to forget her and did not. The cat yodeled his opinion at the door and then forgave her by head-butting her shin. She sat on the floor and let him step into the bowl of her lap and knead his bread on her thighs. She looked at the picture of the handprint until it dissolved and reassembled itself into a map: knuckles high, fingers long, a little scar there. She looked at her own hand and turned it palm up like the fortune-tellers in cheap tents and saw paint line remnants no one else would. Sorry looks good on you, the man had written on the card, and she wanted to put her hand through a wall in a calm, deliberate way. She wanted to say to the city stop teaching boys that apology is a costume. She wanted to get him in a room and close the door and watch his face learn about no, about single-syllable words, about the kind that stand their ground without knives.\n\nSleep came in chunks and brought her a dream about gashes of color that were fabric, not paint, ribbons tied to fenceposts where wind ran itself ragged. The ribbons said all the small words: soon, later, almost, someday, maybe, sorry, wait. She woke with the list in her mouth like beads.\n\nMorning did not bother with seduction. It barged in and told her to put on pants. She did because she is obedient in the exact ways that have kept her alive. Coffee tasted like something trying to be a solution. The news put pictures of the wall in a carousel with fall foliage and a segment on dogs that dress like people for charity. The mayor said words that wanted votes from everyone and thus meant nothing, and a councilwoman said art is conversation and the city needed more of it and Dodge didn\u2019t disagree with her, not really, she just wanted to choose the topic.\n\nOn the way in, her phone shivered. A map again. The little pin near a motel with a neon sign that had lost two letters so that it now shouted something dirty at passing traffic. A message without a greeting: You can see me if you want. He used a picture of a paint palette as his avatar. He had put a French filter on the word color like it made him more interesting.\n\nShe didn\u2019t tell Quinn right away. She drove there and parked where she could see the office but not be seen. The kind of motel where towels have never forgotten who they used to be and the clerk is someone\u2019s cousin stealing time along with cigarettes and the vacuum cleaner has a limp you can hear even through walls. Men came and went like punctuation. She adjusted the rearview mirror and saw herself and the turquoise memory went through her like glass. In the office a television did that daylight talk show babble and a woman with a wig placed like a hat counted something with a clicker.\n\nHe came out like a man who leaves last, not because he had nothing else to do but because he liked being the period. Dark coat, cap, that average height that makes every witness untrustworthy. He paused, not because he felt her eyes but because men like him know how to make a moment a frame. He set his palms on the motel railing like it was a mantle piece and turned them up like he was going to show something to the cheap sky. They were clean. That was the new detail that made her mouth dry. He was cleaning himself again, purging, making innocence where paint had been. He looked down over the parking lot like a prince over his kingdom of dented cars and then walked. She let him go because she needed him to go somewhere so she could decide where to end it and not just spill her bullets across a place where women with wigs count beds.\n\nShe told Quinn after, because she had promised, and he did not scold her but his ears went a little red and that was worse. He called two cars and now their average man had an average tail. If he bought dumplings, they would know. If he went to the river, they would be there first. If he called her, she would not answer for one measured beat and make him think about what it means to wait.\n\nThe day gathered itself in the ugly way days do and they decided to go another place where the turquoise had left its breath behind. The art supply stores had given them nothing except receipts and the man\u2019s fondness for higher-end labels; the hardware store had given them a clerk's memory of a guy who asked for a discount and then had exact cash and smiled too long. They needed someone's eyes not on a payroll. They went to a barber who once cut Dodge\u2019s hair so badly she liked him for being honest. They went to a diner where the waitress had taught three generations of cops to eat eggs and not count it as a weakness. They went to a bridge and stood under it and waited for the river to get bored and tell a different story.\n\nWhen the call came, it wasn\u2019t a map. It was a sound. Screaming makes a shape in air you can draw if you have the right pencil; this was a woman\u2019s voice and a man's laughter behind it and the sound of something heavy deciding to be lighter. They made it to a vacant lot two blocks from the motel, and the lot wore its history of burned cars and prayers like a jacket. In the center, a mannequin stood on a milk crate, painted in that same turquoise, eyes drawn on with exquisite care, lashes that someone had put their tongue out to get right. Around its neck an index card hung on yarn, crooked, like a kindness performed by someone who didn\u2019t really mean it. The card said: TRY AGAIN.\n\nNeighbors stood with their arms folded and their judgment already written down. A man in a yellow cap said this city needs Jesus, and a woman whose jawline had never forgiven her for anything said this is what happens when you defund everything that matters and by everything she meant what she meant. Kids stood behind the tape and learned. The mannequin\u2019s hand was up, not in a wave, but in a posture Dodge recognized from something she couldn\u2019t place. Prayer? Theater? Surrender? She put her fingers on her own wrist and felt for paint that wasn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s practicing with the city now,\u201d Quinn said, and something in him went flat in a useful way. \u201cHe wants us to get good at reading him. He wants applause. He will escalate.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks he is,\u201d she said, and the river air stepped into her nose and set up camp. \u201cHe thinks this is escalation. He\u2019s a coward with pretty supplies. He will misjudge the size of his own shadow and then he will not see the wall until his face is in it.\u201d\n\nShe signed the log for the mannequin like it was a person and that felt indecent and necessary. She told Rhea she was bringing it to her like a cake she didn\u2019t ask for. She took a picture of the index card and sent it to no one. She took one more of the hand, the way the thumb leaned away from the rest like a person at a party who wants to talk but can\u2019t commit. She opened her messages and there was a new note waiting like a coin in an old coat pocket. He had written: You are getting warmer. That is a sentence people put on maps and also on children.\n\nShe closed her eyes and saw the field again, those cones like small orange witnesses, the man by the bleachers, the way he\u2019d called her soldier like he had a right. She wrote back, against everything she knew, against the part of herself that wore doctrine like skin. She typed: Tell me where you learned to make a line that clean. He read it in less than a second. He took his time answering, which made her want to peel the paint off the world.\n\nHe wrote: In a house where nothing was ever left alone. My father painted rooms to keep the walls quiet. We moved a lot. He taught me to cut in without tape because tape is a weakness. If you can\u2019t make the edge clean with your hand, you\u2019re not a man. Then he wrote: Did your father teach you to hold a gun or did the Army do it because your father could not.\n\nShe saw the old man in a Yankees cap, nicotine fingers, paint on knuckles even when he swore he\u2019d washed, forearms the color of the first day of summer and a cough like winter. She saw his laugh when a drop hit the floor and her ten-year-old urge to clean it before he noticed. She saw the ladder and his two-fingered whistle when he wanted a rag and the way he made yellow behave in a kitchen that wanted to be dark. She closed her eyes and swallowed his ghost. She did not answer. You cannot give a thief a map to your house. She put her phone face down in the ashtray she didn\u2019t use and watched by not watching.\n\nNight laid a hand on the city\u2019s head and smoothed it down, again and again, as if that could make it easier to sleep. They got two dozen tips, a hundred opinions, a call from a woman who said turquoise is for boys who never grew up and then cried, a message from a man who said he had been painting fences for thirty years and he knew a clean line when he saw one and this was showroom, a pastor who wanted to pray with her on the phone and did before she could stop him, and it was not awful. They got a note from the art store woman that said your boy\u2019s credit line came through, the anonymous one I told you I shouldn\u2019t have, and the last charge was two weeks ago, and someone like a teacher had slipped some cash in the pot. They got silence where they wanted music and laughter where there should have been none.\n\nBefore midnight, when the bad part of the day puts its shoes on and goes out, Colin texted her a thing he had found in Daniel\u2019s desk, something he thought was nothing and then decided was something. He sent a picture of a folded receipt from a coffee shop near the river with a sentence written on the back in that tidy, summer-school handwriting: Skye says we practice endings so they don\u2019t surprise us. Eight, Thursday, south steps, bring proof. The date was three weeks old. The proof, she supposed, had been Daniel himself, painted and shaking and asking somebody to put a name to it. She saw him walking away from a woman under a streetlight who asked if he had water. She saw him sending a message that said sorry because somebody somewhere had told him that word is a key. She saw a man standing with a brush and the patience of a saint, placing color where it would do the most damage and telling himself he was fixing something.\n\nShe went to the south steps because the map of this city inside her needed a pin there. They were old concrete and new gum, the river loud, the bridge lights practicing being stars. She stood and put her hands in her coat pocket and leaned in that way people lean when their skeletons are tired. She thought about war and walls and the idea that the river had a spine. She thought about the way you learn to cut a line clean, no tape, no cheat, hand steady, breath even, your father watching, saying now, there, see, that\u2019s a man.\n\nFootsteps came and went and none of them were his. She stayed until cold made itself a law and then she went home by a way that had fewer corners. In her kitchen she took the little bottle of turquoise she\u2019d bought and unscrewed it and smelled it like a person committing to a mistake. She dipped a toothpick in and made a dot on a Post-it and stuck it to the inside of a cupboard door where only she would see it. She considered writing a word and she didn\u2019t. She closed the door and the dot was a consequence.\n\nAt two, when the city was practicing its sermon for Sunday, he called. His breath came in quiet and she heard the television in the background tell someone else how to feel. \u201cYou went to the steps. You\u2019re playing now,\u201d he said, pleased, like she had picked the same card as him out of a deck and he could pretend that meant something. \u201cI knew you would. You like old places. You like when the ground remembers more than you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me where you are,\u201d she said, and her voice did not shake because she had learned her voice belonged to her even when everything else didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cEven if I did, would you want to come,\u201d he asked. \u201cOr would you send the boy with the scarf and let him play at being your knight. I think you like being alone with the bad thing. It makes the good thing make sense when you get home and feed your cat. This is me being honest. Are you writing this down. Is the tape rolling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said the word soldier,\u201d she said, and she was done waiting for permission. \u201cWhat do you want me to believe about you when you say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want you to believe I understand,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then I want you to discover I don\u2019t. That is the space I live in. That gap. That\u2019s where I build. Do you want a present. You haven\u2019t said please and I was raised by a man who thought manners were required, but I\u2019ll give it anyway because I\u2019ve had a day.\u201d He laughed softly and her scalp prickled because it sounded like a match drawn along stone. \u201cLook at your email. I found you a brush.\u201d\n\nHe hung up in that way he had, cutting you off like a bad limb. Her email chimed. A picture waited, taken in a bathroom where the mirror was old enough to hate its own job. The sink held a brush, flat, synthetic, bristles flared at one corner like a cowlick, the handle stained with a halo of turquoise and a thumbprint. The faucet leaked. The caption read: 118 Carroway. Hurry. Paint dries.\n\nShe stood so fast the chair gave a cry and then she was moving, coat, keys, gun, phone. She called Quinn and left a sentence that was a destination and a plea disguised as an instruction. She didn\u2019t use sirens. The city did not need to know. The street was two lanes holding a fight between a church and a layaway furniture store, a pawnshop that called itself a boutique and the house with the porch that had always, even before there were cops in it, looked like a place people watched from. The number was on the post in a metal font that had lost a screw and listed. She knocked and no one answered and she pushed and the door did the thing that means nobody made it their habit to lock against the ordinary.\n\nInside smelled like other people\u2019s cooking and a mop that wanted to be more than water. A light was on in the bathroom at the end of the short hall the way all tragic bathrooms live. She walked in with her body arrayed for bad news and found the brush like he promised, in the sink, bristles wet, the stain of turquoise on porcelain like a bruise. On the mirror, written backwards so it would read right when you faced it, in finger dragged through fog: MAYBE.\n\nShe stood and the tub\u2019s drip counted off seconds that weren\u2019t polite anymore. She turned the brush with a glove, looked for hair caught in the ferrule, found one navy thread and a gray eyelash and a cat hair from a cat that wasn\u2019t hers. In the hull of the sink a print had left itself like a fossil, palm and the swirl of skin, and she breathed out slow. He had given her a present he wanted her to think he regretted. He had left the thing that would say his hands had been somewhere, because this was part of the game he thought they were playing. In the hallway, a faint sound, a foot on a stair. She turned and aimed and a woman flinched into her doorway wearing a robe and fear and holding a plastic bag as if it had the answer.\n\n\u201cI rent him the front room,\u201d the woman said, and the words made a small wind in the hall. \u201cNick. He\u2019s good with cash. He says sorry when he is late. He makes the bathroom smell like a swimming pool. Is there trouble. I do not want trouble in my house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always trouble in your house,\u201d Dodge said gently, and put her weapon down, point lowered, voice making a promise she could not keep. \u201cPack a bag and go to your sister\u2019s or wherever it is you go when men love you badly. We\u2019re going to take some of your things and we\u2019re going to leave you a phone number and your life is going to be loud for a while.\u201d\n\nThe woman blinked the way people blink when they don\u2019t have a habit for crying. \u201cHe painted his hair in the sink once,\u201d she said, and the sentence was a child offering a broken toy to a grown-up. \u201cHe said it made him young. He left a shirt in the dryer. You can have it because I never want to touch it again.\u201d\n\nDodge took the shirt. V-neck, cheap, spattered with tiny turquoise comets. She took the brush and the print and the heartbeat of the room. She took the image of herself in the mirror with the word maybe across her chest backwards, which felt like an orthodoxy. She took the knowledge of a street where her boots made a sound like the men down by the river, rain on cardboard. She walked out into the night that had decided to be honest with her and she let herself think, for one unkind moment, about the way his mouth had looked when he said sorry and about the way she would shut it. Then she put the thought away because that is not what good women do and also not what useful ones do. She put the address on the map. She put her finger on the place where the line had been clean. She felt the city tilt a degree toward something like gravity. Then she called Quinn again and when he answered she said the word yes like it was the first time she\u2019d gotten to all week.",

                              "content": "Quinn got there with his tie loosened and his breath fogging and the way he held his shoulders said he hadn\u2019t decided yet whether to break rules or write them down. Patrol was two minutes behind him with the tape and the posture and the clipboard that always made new places feel like they had been born guilty. The landlady watched from the threshold of her room, robe knotted like a promise she never meant to keep, the plastic bag swinging on her wrist with three potatoes and a loaf of bread inside, because hunger keeps its own schedule even when crime gets fancy. Dodge walked him through the sink, the word on the mirror, the easy door, all of it sounding simpler when you said it than it ever is when you live in it. Quinn took the brush from the glove like it was a hatchling and grinned toward the ceiling as if Rhea were already up there, spinning miracles out of bristles and binder. He asked the landlady if he could see the front room and she said it wasn\u2019t a front so much as the place where heat arrived first, and then she handed them a ring with three keys and a rabbit\u2019s foot balding from use. If you spend long enough around lethal men you start to love women like that extra, the ones who hang the calendar at the right height and count blankets with their fingers and believe in God only after lunch.\n\nThe room had been emptied with the precision of a man who had been emptied himself a long time ago and learned to like the feeling. Bed made, the hospital corners a sermon. A duffel gone. The closet a confession of nothing. What was left was the part he wanted her to find. On the windowsill a strip of painter\u2019s tape was stuck like a Band-Aid, and along it five strokes of turquoise descending from fat to fine, a practice of pressure, the kind of thing fathers make sons do in kitchens when the television is too loud to talk over. On the table a stack of paint cards stolen from the same bins in different stores, the names circled in pen with that not-quite-perfect round\u2014Glacial Tide, Pacific Ring, Poolhall Kiss, Robin Glass, January Sea\u2014and in the corner of each card, a tiny letter like a grading rubric, A or B or a single irritated C. There was no notebook, no manifesto; there were index cards, three of them, the words written as if the paper had opinion: MAYBE, SORRY, HE SAID. Under the bed a shoebox held a hand towel with stiff corners from old paint, a lighter, a Metro bus pass loaded to the edge of thoughtless convenience, three art store receipts, two for the fancy brand and one for the cheap brush that had a bristle that flared like a cowlick. In the garbage, the pale ghost of hair dye had left a blue smear where water remembers.\n\nRhea took the brush like a woman accepts a bouquet she did not want, with reverence anyway. She laid powder in the sink and teased the print like you coax a memory out of a drunk cousin at a wedding. She lifted it with tape and breathed onto the mirror to make the word become the thing it had been when the finger wrote it. She said the ridge detail on the sink was clean enough to hang a name on if the database offered generosity, and if not, she would cross her eyes and call it art and listen for a match. She bagged the painter\u2019s tape because oils rub off and men touch with the same hand they gesture with when they are proud. She let the landlady sign the bottom of the chain of custody, and when the woman asked if that made her complicit, Rhea said it made her useful, which is the better thing to be.\n\nBeneath the radiator was the only filthy corner. He had missed it, or he had left it to see if anyone would come all the way down and look. Dodge got on her knees and laid her ear to baseboard and felt the house complain into her skull. She fished with the cheap pen she always used so the nice ones would stay nice and dragged something into light, a wad of gum folded around a hair. The hair was female, long, blonde, and had a pearl clip clasped to it like a jaw. The gum was the kind that tastes like someone telling you to be optimistic, blue and sugar-free. She bagged it, and when she stood there was grit on her jeans and her knee had a complaint to file and the landlady said she told him no gum and then shrugged like boys will be boys and not men for so long it becomes a ghost story.\n\nThe cupboard over the sink had a single mug in it, white with a ring of lipstick nobody in this room had put there. He had cleaned around the lip with a kind of disgust that left everything else shining. On the sill behind the curtain a little jar of mineral spirits had been wedged into a corner like a secret, lid loose enough to talk. She tightened it with two fingers and it squealed like a mouse so small it didn\u2019t know it could die. There were no pictures. The only thing like a picture was the way the bed had been made, the way the edge turned down with a ninety-degree certainty, the way the pillow had been fluffed and then patted flat, leaving the wideslat impression of a hand that believed in rectangles.\n\nQuinn found a towel in the dryer that didn\u2019t belong to any woman with taste. It was motel thin, stamped with the name of a place that had changed hands three times this decade. A shirt fell out stuck to it like a surrender flag, cheap cotton V, small spatter of turquoise on the hem, a bite-mark from a dog at the cuff or a man with a nervous habit. He held it up and then dropped it into a bag and said the thing he always said when there was too much and not enough: okay, okay, okay. Patrol put a lock on the door that would not stop anyone worth stopping. The landlady signed another line and took the officer\u2019s card and asked if she could smoke in the kitchen now and Dodge told her to do whatever she needed to do to make the air belong to her again. The woman lit the cigarette like a prayer and looked at the word on the mirror and then closed the door to the bathroom without breathing out until she had.\n\nThe captain liked this kind of night because it made sense of the chair under him and the brass on his desk. He came down from the fourth floor to stand in the doorway of Dodge\u2019s cube while she was spreading the cards and the scores and the receipts out on a map of the city and putting yarn nowhere, because she wasn\u2019t that kind of detective and she was never going to be. He stood long enough to be counted and said they would have a press conference at ten with as few adjectives as possible, and that the mayor would say art is conversation and the department would say crime is not art. He told her to sleep and then did that thing bosses do with women they respect and fear: he asked if she needed anything and when she said no he believed her and hated that he did. Quinn fell asleep with his head on the back of his chair and his mouth open a fraction and his scarf making an untidy nest, and when he snored once, he woke himself and apologized to the ceiling like it has feelings.\n\nRhea texted at three with a photo of the lifted print from the sink and the handprint off Dodge\u2019s hood laid side by side, the ridges lined like a hymn you know in your bones, and wrote: same boy, congrats on your taste. She wrote again at four with a link to a partial hit in a database that did not belong to police and wasn\u2019t supposed to be searchable, a thumbprint from a study at the Livery where Skye Delaney had once had participants ink their hands and press them to paper to talk about labor and ownership. A man named N.H. had signed his sheet with initials and a little flourish on the H that looked exactly like the swallow of ink on the tail of the y down at the wall. It wasn\u2019t true, not yet, it wasn\u2019t enough, but it was something for the mouth to hold. Rhea wrote: tell your adjunct she runs a tidy ship, we could learn from her index cards. Dodge wrote back: I\u2019ll send donuts with bacon if you give me a name for the N.H. and Rhea sent a GIF of a woman putting on lipstick in a rearview mirror and wrote: manners, soldier.\n\nShe didn\u2019t sleep at her desk because sleep at your desk says a thing about you to the wrong person. She went home and put water on her face and it ran off her like she had waxed herself with grief. She fed the cat whose love came with terms and slept in her bed with the window open because the night needed somewhere to leave. She dreamed a dream that was part recruitment video and part art school, a drill instructor with paint on his knuckles yelling cut in, cut in, cut your line clean, no tape, the hand is your tool, the heart is a liability, and woke with the taste of chalk in her throat and the faith that whatever shadow the man cast was going to have to pass through a place she could stand.\n\nMorning in this city is always a little theatrical. The sky tries on three different lights before it commits. Dodge bought the donuts Rhea wanted and two she didn\u2019t, because sugar makes people generous with nouns. Rhea took a bacon mapleglaze and made a satisfied noise that belonged in a different room and then turned to her machines and wrote an algorithm to love what she loved. She put the brush under a microscope and they all leaned in like children at a zoo. Tiny turquoise flaked at the edges of synthetic bristle clamped in nicked metal, a fingerprint in the seal where a man with the wrong hands had put the thing together in a factory in a country that makes room for your cheap. Rhea flicked the dial and showed them a single dark hair wrapped around a bristle like a well-meaning snake, and said she would tell them what floor cleaner he used if they wanted, but also give her thirty to run the prints again through a wider net of places that would be mad if they knew she knew how to call them.\n\nThe prints came back with a story she hated for how small it was. A trespass ticket from two years ago, south Steps, no less, a cop with a pen and a headache writing N. Harlan in the line where name lives and trying to make the H look like it might be a different letter later if a lawyer said it. A loss-prevention match from a big-box home store where someone had pocketed a fancy brush on a Tuesday and then paid for something he did not need to distract the camera, a clerk writing Nicolas H., thirty-two, average, had the kind of eyes that make people tell the truth and then hate him for it, the kind of note a woman writes when she\u2019s trying not to get herself in trouble for seeing too much. A counselor note from a county intake never completed because Nick had decided to be fine and no one had insisted, the appointment marked maybe on a paper calendar, because some institutions still like to have something to erase. It wasn\u2019t enough to put cuffs on yet. It was enough to put boots on and go knock.\n\nSkye Delaney took the name like a stone in the teeth, rolled it, spit it out. She said Harlan like it meant fence and fencepost and fence that needs painting and a man who makes you hold the bucket because that means you love him. She pulled his old forms out of a folder because she keeps everything for the day she can use it to do good instead of letting it be ballast in her closet, and there it was, the smiling boy who had turned into a man with a coat everyone notices only when he takes it off. Nicolas Harlan, the Livery\u2019s waiver signed in his precise hand, the line where it said I consent to be looked at filled in once and then again, darker, like a person practicing a signature they think they will need. In the emergency contact he had written Father and then crossed it out and written No one and then written Sorry and then left it, the word an orphan on a sad line. In the back, a note in Skye\u2019s handwriting about the day he cried when she told him his work had intention but not risk, and how she had to sit with him for twenty minutes while he learned breathing again, in and out and not on the floor.\n\nSkye Benning said the name and her eyes did a little hiding act before they stood still. She said he had never used Harlan in her lobby, but it fit his mouth in the way that made you believe him when you did not want to. She said he had the habit of reading pamphlets without flipping them over, like he wanted the promise without the footnotes. She pulled the lobby footage again because she likes to be accurate, and they watched him not look at the camera again, and then look right into it once, for one frame, and there was the thing Rhea liked to find in her machines and Dodge liked to find in men, the tiny movement that gave away intent. He knew the camera, and he knew how to love himself through it.\n\nQuinn ran the name through everything he was allowed to touch and a few he wasn\u2019t. Nicolas Geoff Harlan had a father in Sumner who still kept a landline and still answered it like a man in the seventies, the voice a shape you could put a face on right away, the kind that has taught boys to cut in without tape because tape is for men who never learned their hands. He had a mother who had left when he was fourteen and then died in Florida under palm trees that made promises tourists believe, a death that had nothing to do with him and everything and the obituary had been written by a cousin who signed it with three first names. He had a GED from a place that wore a different name now. He had two W-2s spread over six years, both seasonal, both cash-lighter than they should be. He had a parking ticket at a trailhead where people go to pretend their thighs will carry them out of their own lives. He had a mobile that changed every six months and a friend named Blue so often in his contacts that it was either a joke or a failed brand.\n\nThey went to Sumner because fathers are maps whether they want to be or not. The house was not the one Dodge had expected. It was not gone to hell or kept too clean; it was clean where the eye falls and dirty where the hand does, and the hand had been distracted. The porch had fresh paint in a color the catalog had called Barn Door and the real world called Blood That Behaved. A ladder leaned in a way that had gotten narrower with years of leaning. The man who opened the door wore old muscle like a coat with someone else\u2019s name stitched into the collar. His forearms told a story about weight and repetition and the affection men take for their tools when their sons won\u2019t speak to them.\n\n\u201cHarlan,\u201d he said when she showed him the badge, like she had told him a last name he used to be proud of and now wasn\u2019t. \u201cHe\u2019s not here. He hasn\u2019t been here since the last time he wanted to tell me I didn\u2019t teach him enough and I told him to bring a wall and I\u2019d show him. What do you want me to do. Cry on the porch.\u201d\n\nDodge watched his mouth move and saw in it the way Nicolas\u2019s mouth made the word sorry look like currency. \u201cWe want to know who taught him to paint without tape,\u201d she said, and the corner of the man\u2019s eye did a grim little dance that belonged to shame and rage and a third thing, pity.\n\n\u201cI taught him to do it right. I taught him to keep the edge and clean the brush and not waste what you can\u2019t afford. I taught him to put rugs down because paint is a liar and it jumps. I taught him to take a breath at the top of a line and let your hand be the thing God made it and not the thing it becomes when you let the radio and the rent get inside it,\u201d he said, and then he took a step back and let them in as if those words had required hospitality as payment. \u201cI did not teach him to hurt nobody. He liked to be seen. He\u2019d paint a wall and then he\u2019d stand outside and stare at it longer than you had to to see if the edge was good. That\u2019s not normal. But it\u2019s not a crime. I told him normal and good aren\u2019t the same thing and he told me shut up like a man who thinks news doesn\u2019t apply to him.\u201d\n\nThe living room had the tidy shabbiness of someone who lived mostly in the shed. On the wall were two pictures that wanted to be noticed and wouldn\u2019t look at you straight on, one of a boy with a cast in eighth grade, messages scrawled in sharpie that had faded to the color of old gum, get better nick!! and you owe me $5 and a phone number someone hoped would survive the summer. The other a faded print of a farmhouse under snow from a calendar twelve years old that had been framed because the month had been good to them. The kitchen smelled like coffee done the way men who won\u2019t admit to sugar do coffee. In the doorway to the hall a strip of painter\u2019s tape had been left at a perfect right angle, and it would bother a man with this blood to see it and not peel it, so Dodge peeled it and he looked at her hand like he might like her finally.\n\n\u201cYou hit him,\u201d she said like she was talking about the weather, and the man had to take that sentence somewhere he put high on a shelf. He set his jaw like he was fitting a blade into a handle.\n\n\u201cI taught him to be a man,\u201d he said. He looked at Quinn with a glance that asked this one over here, does he still say sir to anyone, and when Quinn didn\u2019t flinch he dropped it and said: \u201cI hit what was around. It was never about him. That\u2019s a lie but it was the way I told it to myself so I could go to sleep. You going to arrest me for the nineties.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to ask for a picture of him when he wasn\u2019t wearing paint,\u201d she said, and softened because the sentence said more than it needed to. He got an album from the bedroom some woman had left a long time ago and turned pages with calloused thumbs, and there was the kid, freckles before he learned to stand. There was the teenager, sideways hat before he learned fashion is a way to apologize. There was the young man with a brush held wrong in a yard where grass had done its best with bad soil. Dodge took pictures with her phone because she has learned that things vanish even in your hands.\n\n\u201cHe knows your house is honest,\u201d she said at the door, because it might give the man something to do with his day other than fold himself inside his shed. \u201cHe uses your rules when he needs rules. He\u2019s in Nashville and he\u2019s painting boys for an audience and he thinks he has an argument that will make me forgive him.\u201d\n\nThe man laughed and it sounded like a floorboard giving up. \u201cHe never learned to live with no,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to have a dog and that thing, you tell it no and it would save your life. He did not have that. You all right out there. You got a face like my mother\u2019s when the hurricane was coming and the radio was too quiet.\u201d\n\nShe thanked him for his porch and took the kind of breath you take before you drive away from a childhood, left or not, and she could feel Quinn looking at her profile because he\u2019s a good partner and he knows when you need to be asked and when you don\u2019t. Her phone buzzed before the turn out of the subdivision and Rhea\u2019s name did what it always did, put energy into the part of her chest she was pretending had gone to lunch. The text said: sink print and hood print match our lobby boy and match your Livery handprint; N.H.\u2019s partial from the Livery is your man; congratulations on catching art with art; also: partial latent on paint card from wall matches same, so he doesn\u2019t wear gloves when he\u2019s proud. I\u2019m printing you a poster.\n\nBy noon the story had grown a head and three tails. The wall had its own hashtag and the city had a thinkpiece and a man with a podcast had called the turquoise the hue of modern alienation as if melancholy could be Pantone, and a mother group had written an open letter about boys and consent and paint and the way apology gets taught like a virtue. The captain\u2019s press conference did the thing it needed, and anchored somewhere below it, the fact: the department was seeking a person of interest, Nicolas Geoff Harlan, thirty-two, average height, left-handed, old scar on the left thumb, associated with the Nashville arts community and the Vanderbilt campus, last seen near the pedestrian bridge downtown. He\u2019d be live by the six o\u2019clock, and by three a woman in Antioch called and said he once tried to sell her a painting in a parking lot and had apologized when she said she didn\u2019t have cash in a way that made her feel like she\u2019d stolen something. She had kept the card he wrote his number on because she kept everything and the number didn\u2019t work anymore, but the loop on the y was a swallow, and Rhea pulled it into her nest and made it sing the same song as the others.\n\nThey went back to the Livery with a copy of the BOLO and the way the room went silent was a kindness. Skye stood with her arms full of herself like a person who knows which way she\u2019s falling already but is going to pretend she can reconsider. She looked at the picture from the father\u2019s album and let the boy turn into the man in front of her and bit her lip like she had been caught being wrong by a younger version of herself. She said she had a bench she let students build on and when they carved their names underneath, sometimes they carved other people\u2019s names too, and she took them to the bench and flipped it and there was N.H. and there was the year and a little turquoise dot next to it like a seal. She gave Dodge a box with the sign-in sheets from those months and there, three weeks back, under Daniel Payne\u2019s attempt at a signature that looked like he wanted to be taken seriously, was a line that had to be him, thin letters, precise, written with a pen that had gotten caught on the downstrokes, and next to it, in the place where kids write @names so they can find each other later, he had written: @maybeisyes. It didn\u2019t exist anymore, the handle had been closed, but that was enough for Quinn to make a list of places it would have cached itself, for Rhea to click holes in a thing that had tried to be a shield.\n\nWhen the lab got the shirt from the dryer under better light, they found a smear on the inside hem, the color not turquoise but the quiet pink of skin after someone presses too hard with anything. It could be Daniel. It could be anybody. They cut it out like a small wound and sent it to the place where DNA gets told to talk faster, and the woman there said she would call them by morning like she always does and she would probably be right sooner because she never sleeps when the city is playing at art.\n\nThe text came at four, not a map this time but a script. He sent her a picture of a room painted half in a turquoise that hurt a little if you stared, masking tape along the edge because he thought it would annoy her, the tape not even sticky because men like him don\u2019t notice when old tape gives up. He wrote: Do you like it with tape. Tell me yes or no. He wrote: I have a place tonight. He wrote: You will come because you understand me. That last sentence made a curl of laughter rise up from something feral inside her, and she let it out in the car where no one else would be asked to keep it.\n\nShe wrote back a sentence that made Quinn cough and then nod when she showed him because he understood the need to make a man put his own words in his mouth. She wrote: I don\u2019t understand you. I understand edges. He answered in eight seconds like a boy. He wrote: South steps. He wrote: Dark. He wrote: Bring light. He wrote: Bring your sorry.\n\nThey staged it like a play because everything with him had a stage and everyone with a badge knows how to use a theater when one\u2019s offered. Patrol was invisible in the ways they train for and rarely succeed at, boots memorizing squeaks, radios turned down so the god voice in them doesn\u2019t blow the part. Quinn tucked himself into a shadow he had decided belonged to him and the river made its old noise, the one she would hear in her bones long after she left this city for any amount of time. She wore her coat and her steady and a vest under the coat that felt like a liar\u2019s handshake because it always has to be too tight to feel like it will save you. She stood where he had told her because you do that when you\u2019re taught to be bait, and she didn\u2019t have to pretend to breathe harder than she wanted; the body does that when you call it to work.\n\nHe came like all theatre people come, late enough to make you remember you wanted him and early enough to make you doubt yourself for doubt\u2019s sake. He had cleaned up or he had borrowed clean from someone else; his coat had learned a new trick and the cap was gone and the hair was combed in the way men learn from other men in barracks or prisons or families. He held his hands in front of him, palms up, like he was coming to be searched and forgiven. He smiled the smile he had tried on in bathroom mirrors and on the glass of windows at night, and he said her name like he\u2019d earned it.\n\n\u201cThere are too many people at this party,\u201d he said, like he was being chivalrous on behalf of his sake. \u201cYou brought a choir. I wanted a duet.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanted a stage,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the one I could keep clean for you.\u201d\n\nHe looked at the stairs like they were listening. He had paint under one nail, a moon of it, stubborn. He put one hand on the rail, and the rail took its time, remembering everyone who\u2019d done that before him, and Dodge saw the moment her father had prepared her for without meaning to\u2014the point where a line wants to become a curve and the hand wants to show off. He had his back to the river, which is not intelligent if you plan on living. He had his mouth shaping something, maybe, sorry, soldier, he had all his little words and all his expensive paint and the edge of the step under his heel and for a second he thought he was the one who knew the choreography.\n\nShe said his name flat, the way you take color out of a wall, and it did a thing to his face you could only do with a word. He blinked and then didn\u2019t, and two things happened in the same heartbeat: a man who had no business walking his dog that late came up the far steps with enough noise to startle sleep and a gull laughed itself mean over the water. Nicolas moved toward the sound with his shoulders, and Patterson from Patrol stepped because he was built of that, and Dodge said no in a tone of voice she had honed on men much bigger than this, and Nicolas ran because running is a language the body knows even when the head thinks it is speaking art.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t fast the way television wants. He was efficient in the way boys who have run from houses are. He knew the weak slat in the fence by the fire lane and the alley where the trash bins tilt into shadows and the way you can flatten your ribs and become a page when a truck passes. Quinn was good and stayed good until he saw the way Nicolas used the curb to summon height and then he did the thing partners do\u2014it stopped being about orders and started being about your own body knowing how to do what it was built for. He cut left. He ate air. He lost him for ten counts in a parking lot that belonged to a church and a night chef and then he saw the flash that wasn\u2019t flash at all, the little flare of turquoise when a sleeve pulled up and Nicolas slapped his hand against a wall to turn and left the ghost of his pressure there.\n\nDodge did not run in a straight line. She ran the way water finds, hugging edges, looking for the place gravity was a rule and not a rumor. She saw him cut across a playground where the swing sets looked like gallows in the wrong light and into the mouth of a street that wanted to be a dead end and wasn\u2019t, and then he was gone, but not, because the smell hung back like a man\u2019s aftershave when he has failed to leave the room before you arrived. They stopped because stopping has to be allowed or you die in little inches, and she listened to the wind decide if it would tell on him. It didn\u2019t. It blew cheap and mean up from the river and carried laughter from a bar and the sound of a train reminding the city that it\u2019s always leaving.\n\nOn the playground, in the sand no one remembers to replace, at the base of the slide, was a paint chip the size of her thumbnail. She picked it up with the grim patience she had been taught and held it to her nose like a person prays, and it was him. It was the expensive stuff. It was the binder that dries too slow and makes the edge clean and the hand dirty. She pocketed it as a wrong kind of lucky token and straightened. Quinn stood beside her with his hands on his hips and his head down, breathing like a person who knows he still has stairs in him, and he let out a laugh he did not mean, the relieving kind, the why are we alive kind, the we will get him because he is not a god kind.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said, and the word had on it all the miles and none of the brag. \u201cSo he wants to run. We can run. He wants a stage. We can change the lighting.\u201d\n\nThey went back, reluctantly the way people leave a fight that isn\u2019t over, and it was only on the walk that Dodge let the world come back in around her at the edges. The city was doing its wet shine thing. Men smoked and tossed the butts at storm drains like they could plug them with their bad habits. Women in coats walked in pairs with their arms looped through one another like they had invented that. Somewhere a trumpet made a fool out of a cheap song. Her phone lifted its head. Rhea again, which meant good news or science. Rhea had a picture of the index card from the wall blown up until the fibers of the paper looked like a landscape. She had circled a little speck at the corner and annotated like a teacher: ash from gum wrapper? minted. She wrote: our boy chews the same brand as the wad under the radiator; also, the blonde hair you pulled belongs to Skye Delaney or someone with her mitochondrial story; she gave me a sample and rolled her eyes; don\u2019t read the second thing as bigger than it is; rooms share hair. Then, another text: DNA on the shirt hem is Daniel. Be kind when you write that down.\n\nDodge stood in the shadow of the precinct doorway with her phone brightening her face in a way she would punish in any other person and felt the shape of the thing in her hands. Not the case; the case was a house with too many additions and not enough foundations. The thing was the word he loved and the way the city used it and the way her mouth had been taught to carry it without biting down. She pictured him being eight and being told maybe about a Christmas tree and then told no when the check bounced and then told sorry when the lights didn\u2019t work and then told say thank you anyway, and that would be too easy if you believed in that kind of narrative. Men are not made of one night. They are made of every time they didn\u2019t get punched when they should have and every time they were kissed for saying they didn\u2019t mean it and every time someone hung a wall in front of them and told them paint is a way to make weight look like a choice.\n\nQuinn nudged her with his shoulder like a boy because sometimes you have to let the child part of yourself touch another person or you calcify. \u201cYou have thoughts,\u201d he said, and it wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cI hate his father for not believing in tape,\u201d she said, and he laughed low and let it be worth more than it was. \u201cHe will do something bigger to be the thing the city talks about and he will do it where we can\u2019t pretend not to look. He likes water and he likes steps and he likes walls and he likes being an average man walking into frame. He likes us more than he wants to. He will call again. He will call me, not you, not a tip line. He thinks we are in a drama where I have to understand him. He thinks this means I will forgive him when he tells me which day his mother left. He is wrong,\u201d she said, and the last two words felt like a small warm stove you can put your hands over.\n\nThe captain had a mood for them back upstairs. Someone had made a nickname for this that she could not deal with yet and he threw it on the ground and stamped it. He asked what it would take to keep any body from being painted across the face of the river and she said floodlights and hubris and four more bodies nobody had paid for. He assigned them three uniforms who knew a stage from a street. He told her to sleep and she didn\u2019t argue loudly; she would go home and lie down and watch the ceiling do its quiet job and make deals with herself about sugar and not answering calls and not thinking about tissue cards and then she would answer the call and think about the cards and eat Rhea\u2019s donut she had saved in the desk drawer like a sin.\n\nHe texted at eleven like a boy who had been told to wait an hour after eating to swim and couldn\u2019t. He wrote: That was fun. He sent nothing else. She did not answer because she respected the ancient magic of withholding. She fell asleep faster than she deserved to and dreamed that she had painted her throat bolts of turquoise and that men kept asking her to say maybe and she couldn\u2019t because her mouth was a wall, and when she woke she was biting her lip and the cat had slept on her calves like a sandbag.\n\nHer door buzzed at six like a rude morning. Colin was on the steps with a hoodie that said a school he didn\u2019t go to and a face that had learned three new ways to carry a day\u2019s worth of new weight. He held out a plastic storage bin like he had found it and didn\u2019t want to own it any longer than he had to. Inside, alphabetized in the way of boys who have been told to be careful without instructions, were Daniel\u2019s paintings, small ones done on paper cheap enough to fold, quick studies of wrists and necks and walls and the underside of elbows, shadows that didn\u2019t pretend to be anything other than themselves. In the bottom, folded twice, a list, his tidy summer-school hand again, supply runs and names and a note to self: if he says maybe, ask him where the yes lives. The yes had never lived in that man and they had missed it or they had known it and thought they could invent it and either way they were in it now.\n\nColin cried and said he was sorry and then got angry and said he was tired of that word and then said it again because habits are harder to break than hearts. Dodge gave him the ugly truth in a soft voice, which is the only way to do it where it sticks without scarring. She told him they had a name and a half and a father and a wall and that they would now begin the part of the story where incompetence gets loud and luck gets greedy and a man learns what it feels like when a city says the smallest word it knows and means it.\n\nOn the way in, the river was a steel belt around the city\u2019s belly and the morning had decided on hard blue like paint chips on a table. The wall, the turquoise one, had acquired a second line in the night, written in the hand of someone who couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and needed to fight back with letters. Beneath HE SAID MAYBE some stranger had written in spray paint the color of asphalt warmed by August: I SAID NO. The city had found its chorus. Patrol had rolled their eyes and then kept the tape tight. A woman in a green beanie mouthed thank you to no one and walked on.\n\nThe phone rang on her desk before her computer could remember its password. He let her hear him breathe for a long enough count that she knew he had been practicing being calm. \u201cYou ran,\u201d he said, as if she had been the one moving. \u201cYou smelled like old rain and metal and that made me want to tell you something good.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me something useless,\u201d she said, because that\u2019s how you make men like him talk, you lower the bar to a place where they think they will trip over it in triumph and then they bring you something they didn\u2019t mean to.\n\n\u201cDid you know turquoise is the stone people carry against the evil eye,\u201d he said, smug with research and his own sense of being connected to older things. \u201cIt keeps bad looking at you. It keeps envy from chewing holes in your shirt. It\u2019s why women wear it on their throats, so you don\u2019t get caught there. I think that\u2019s beautiful. Do you think that\u2019s beautiful, soldier.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you read the little card in the case at the jewelry store,\u201d she said, and he laughed, pleased with the picture of himself being both petty thief and poet. \u201cTell me where you keep the brushes you don\u2019t like. Tell me where you put the color you hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t keep what I hate,\u201d he said. \u201cI make it into something and then I leave it where someone else has to decide what to do with it. You do that too. You keep making me into something I am not and then you pretend you don\u2019t have to own it. Listen. I\u2019m telling you something good now. Tonight they have an art walk and girls in boots will drink wine out of plastic and people will pretend they are patron saints because they pointed at a wall and said nice and then bought a candle. I will be working. I will give you a front-row seat. Wear a coat,\u201d he said, affectionate as a caution, and hung up before she could tell him she was already wearing it and had been for years.\n\nShe sat in the chair long enough to be a piece of furniture, then she stood because chairs make you soft. She told the captain they were going to the art walk and he said how many and she said all of them. She told Rhea to bring the kind of powder that makes bad plans visible and Rhea said she liked walking downtown on the city\u2019s good nights because she could feel the power running under the sidewalk like a river that had decided to be useful. She told Quinn to buy a hat that would keep the drizzle out of his ears because he looked like a man who got an earache when he was a boy and never grew out of it. He told her she looked like she had decided to shoot him tonight and she told him she had decided not to.\n\nBy five, barricades made streets think they were safe. Trucks with ladders and lights blocked off corners for no reason other than to make a mood. Pops of generator noise stitched the air into squares. Children with parents who wanted them to be cultured and not poor walked holding hands so hard their arms got longer. A man on a soapbox preached against everything that was not his god and a woman sold ceramics with little holes in them to keep people honest. The Livery had a banner someone had painted with a broom and a hopeful mind. Skye stood in the doorway and did the work all women do when they are in charge of a thing in public, she greeted and counted and watched and wanted and pretended not to worry about the way several men lingered without an excuse. She saw Dodge and gave her a nod that said I will not let my kids die for your investigation and Dodge nodded back a language that said she didn\u2019t plan to let anyone die for anything.\n\nHe didn\u2019t show his face first. He left a handprint, on a utility box at hip height where drunks steady themselves, fingers in turquoise, the thumb at that little strange angle, fresh enough that the air carried the smell and a woman in a leather jacket smeared it with her handbag without noticing and said damn and then laughed because she loved herself for pretending not to care. He left a thin line on the curb, a clean line where curb met street, a stripe that would mean nothing to anyone who hadn\u2019t stood in his room and watched him practice pressure. He left a word in the condensation of a window, breathed on, fingered in: almost. He left it over and over on different panes in different hands, his, or the hands he liked to make his. He was making her walk. He was making her look. He was making himself into a weather pattern.\n\n\u201cSouthwest corner at Commerce,\u201d Quinn said over the radio in a voice that had learned to leave yawns in two blocks back. \u201cMan with average height and a cap we hate just put a bottle with tissue in it on a ledge. Not lit. Not a fire. A flower. That old trick. White roses wrapped in blue. He likes his craft stores.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t spook him,\u201d she said, and hated that it was true, that you have to not spook a man like this until he believes his act enough to hand you the bow. She walked instead of running because running makes crowds behave like schools of fish and then nothing is good again for an hour. She saw him from thirty feet and didn\u2019t make it known that she had. He was taller and shorter as usual, and the average of him was the weapon. He had eyes that would look blue if you wanted them to and brown if you didn\u2019t. He had a brush in his hand and he was using it on air, practicing strokes and letting the bristles kiss nothing, and the nothing kissed back. He stepped up on the low wall that kept a perfect child from rolling into a hedge, and he made something out of the night and his wrist.\n\nHe painted a boy\u2019s face. Not Daniel\u2019s. Not anyone she knew. He painted a face onto the blankness of a temporary construction scrim, huge strokes that were too sure for a drunk, not enough mistakes for a real artist with an audience. The face was a face you\u2019d like, a face you\u2019d tell to come in out of the rain. Over it, he wrote in the large hand kids learn when adults are watching: HE SAID MAYBE. Below it, in smaller letters, in a hand he made tender on purpose: It\u2019s okay. I asked. The crowd murmured the way crowds do when they want to be part of a conversation. A teenager took a selfie with his tongue out and his friend\u2019s hand on his neck in a way that pretended to be a joke.\n\nPatrol shouldered and breathed. Quinn stepped into a place where the night light was all ankle bone and watched, gun not up, other hand making a shape in the air that said not yet. Dodge stood still the way she\u2019d been trained, which is to say while every muscle begged to be used, and she said the man\u2019s name because it worked when you said a dog\u2019s name and it worked when you didn\u2019t want it to. He turned his head like a fox who hears his own song.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said, but he said it like someone who was asking her to watch more, not like someone who expected obedience. \u201cIt\u2019s not done. It\u2019s not done when you stop liking it. It\u2019s done when I\u2014\u201d\n\nShe closed the distance with a pardon me that belonged in a different room and put her hand on his brush hand just hard enough that the bristles squealed. He went still and the crowd did that small sound\u2014oh\u2014and a man at the edge with a camera decided whether to stand down or become a journalist. His skin was warm, and men are that, and it won\u2019t save or convict them. He blinked once like a camera with a slow shutter and then faster because this is what you do when a woman touches you where you want to be in charge. She held until she could feel his pulse not just through his wrist but through the plastic handle of the brush, which is too intimate a thing to know about a stranger. She let go. She stepped back enough to be a cop again and not whoever that had been.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s your yes,\u201d she said, and the word was a small sharp tool in her mouth. \u201cI will say yes to arrest. Nicolas Geoff Harlan, you\u2019re under arrest. We can recite the rest by the book or I can sing it.\u201d\n\nHe smiled because he knew the book and songs and thought his role was written for him. He glanced past her shoulder like men do when they don\u2019t want to show their hands. He shifted his weight on the wall like a boy who has done benches his whole life. He went left and Quinn was already there, the scarf somehow useful now as decoration if not defense, and the patrol officer with the good mother\u2019s instincts put her hand out and took the brush in one smooth move like she had been handed things by men her whole life and learned finally how to accept them as evidence and not gifts. He tried to pivot and the crowd did that thing they do where nobody wants to be the person the story sticks to when it is over, they parted and they closed and they raised their phones like candles in old churches, and the river forgot its own name for a beat.\n\nHe ran. They ran. He went around the side of the box truck with the catering logo and down the gap between two galleries that used to be a life and now were a retail dream and a place you could buy a bag that would never go out of style and he hit a closed gate and it hit back. He climbed and his foot slipped and his wrist left a clean line of turquoise down the cheap paint of the gate and then he was over and he was gone into a back lot where men smoke and girls cry and brooms lean. Quinn went for the street because he knows to be a band, not a solo. Dodge went for the gap because she is built for it and hates it and does it anyway.\n\nHe had planned it. Of course he had. He had practice runs that had taught him how his breath sounds at the corner, how the light falls on the obliging puddle, how to slide under the lip of the dumpster without cutting his coat, how to keep his average height from being nothing by making himself into a shadow on the brick that nobody looks at until it moves. He had set a paint card on the ground like a trick coin. She didn\u2019t step on it. She jumped it like a child playing at not getting lava on her shoes, and then she smiled because you have to take the small pleasures you can when a man has stolen as many of the bigger ones as he thinks he owns.\n\nHe went up a fire escape that hadn\u2019t earned the name. She followed with a proficiency her knee protested and the badge on her chest reminded her why. He had a head start and that was the whole trick with lives like his. On the third landing, he stopped not because he was tired but because he wanted a picture. He turned and held his hands up again, palms, those paint-mapped machines, and he looked over her shoulder at the old city like a lover he was leaving and he said sorry like he had always said it, and she had so many places in her body that remembered that word she didn\u2019t know where to put it anymore. She put it in the handcuff. She put one cuff on him and the metal did its precise, ancient whisper, and then somebody yelled in the street below because it was Friday and their own fight had come due, and Nicolas was a man who used noise like a lever. He jerked his wrist, her hand slipped through turquoise that had not made itself dry, he twisted, he put his shoulder into her collarbone like an apology, she swallowed air she hadn\u2019t meant to, he went up one more flight and her body forgot what she had promised it about not running up stairs anymore.\n\nOn the roof, the city was a new platform he had built without permission and loved because of that fact. The river was a piano lid propped open. The wall with the turquoise could be seen if you stood on your toes. He made as if to bow. He made as if to jump. He had never wanted to be dead; he had wanted to see the look on a woman\u2019s face when he made her believe he might. She told her gun to keep its mouth shut. She walked the last three yards like there was nothing left to break. He stepped back. His heel found nothing. He flinched like a fish. She grabbed his coat with a hand that had held the inside of a man\u2019s ribcage once and felt the slick shine of expensive paint against cheap fabric and then he was weight, all the ordinary of him, and the two of them were a shape that from the street would look like something else, and the edge put its cold truth against her knuckles, and the river laughed.\n\nThey fell half a story and hit the next roof, an ugly little annex that didn\u2019t know it was important until just then, and the way her body learned to fold under other bodies kept it from being worse. He tried to make himself a ghost and she introduced him to the idea of gravity with her knee across his clumsy beauty. She showed him a wrist lock in the kind of gentleness you learn in Army tents and women\u2019s bathrooms and she put the second handcuff on him like you lower a curtain on a show that has outstayed. The sound the cuffs make when they are done right is not loud. It is a decision. It is a door closing on a room you don\u2019t need to visit again. It is the sound she likes best when she is allowed to have favorites.\n\nPatrol found their way up with the kind of delay that means they didn\u2019t get paid enough to believe in themselves in buildings like this. Someone threw a rope in case anyone wanted theater. Quinn came around the lip of the annex with his scarf flung back dramatically like he might let himself have that, and he saw the two of them and his mouth did the truth and a joke at once. He said, \u201cGood evening,\u201d in that harmless way and bent and put his hand on Nicolas\u2019s shoulder like he was checking the temperature of a roast. Nicolas lay there breathing like he had been told to practice and looking up at a sky that was not his and making a little smile just for himself like a man who understands that the stage goes dark and has practiced elsewhere.\n\n\u201cYou good,\u201d Quinn asked her, and she wanted to say yes in the way that meant forever and nothing and instead she nodded because her throat had decided to do a different job.\n\nHe looked up at the thing, the city, the edge they had not fallen from, and he let himself have his own metaphor just that once. \u201cI don\u2019t like rooftops,\u201d he said. \u201cToo much sky.\u201d\n\nThey led him down stairs and into lights and into sound and into the habit men have of making other people look at them. He didn\u2019t fight because fighting would make him ugly and he can\u2019t stand that. He didn\u2019t cry because crying is for rooms where women own the door. He watched Dodge as if they were still on the phone, as if the only people in the city were him and her and the river, and he mouthed a word when no one else was looking. Maybe. She shook her head. No. He smiled like a man who has been told he is adored and instead has learned he is alive.\n\nWhen the room swallowed him, when the elevator\u2019s polite ding cut the night into pieces and made sense of them, she leaned against a wall that wasn\u2019t turquoise and let the cold of it climb her spine like a spine replenishing itself. The city breathed and people clapped because they had seen a show and were grateful even if they didn\u2019t want to admit to that part. The wall down the block wore its sentence into moonlight and the second line, the one some stranger had written, glowed faint where paint can sometimes talk itself into luminescence. I SAID NO. She said it out loud with her mouth as if she had not been saying it her whole life already, and she listened to the sound of the smallest word in English make the kind of difference she had joined uniformed men and then deserted them to learn.\n\nBack at the precinct, the ritual. Property forms and chain-of-custody and Rhea coming in with a grin like a pocketknife and taking things out of bags and putting them into their own new bags, better ones, where they\u2019d be told their names and then called those names in court. The captain shook her hand and liked his own grip as always. The district AG sent a text without punctuation that might have been heart or eye-roll or both. Davenport asked if anybody wanted pizza and nobody wanted to say yes because it would look unprofessional and then they all said yes because they had no sugar left and donuts aren\u2019t dinner.\n\nShe sat on the other side of the glass and watched him take in the room that had a table and two chairs and everything in it meant to make you think it\u2019s an ordinary place to talk. He liked rooms like this because he thought he could decorate the air. He took his seat like a king sitting on a crate and folded his hands like someone had told him once that only the guilty cross their arms and he had believed them because men like him always think there are rules and they can find them in themselves. He looked straight at the mirror because you can\u2019t not. He smiled mildly and practiced looking like he understood gravity. He had paint where you can\u2019t get it unless you\u2019re proud and careless at once, flecks on his ear, in the little whorl at the shell. His thumb again, that stubborn geometry, the scar that dreams up personality on its own.\n\nQuinn went in first because Dodge made herself old-fashioned sometimes and let a man pretend he could be a good cop so he wouldn\u2019t become a bad one. He did okay. He didn\u2019t say his name first. He didn\u2019t ask if he wanted water because offering men things gives them the wrong idea. He said, \u201cYou know why you\u2019re here,\u201d and Nicolas said, \u201cBecause you can\u2019t catch an idea on tape,\u201d and that got written down in the margin of the report with a small star next to it because it would sound good later in a courtroom on a podcast. He answered questions that didn\u2019t matter with precision and walked around questions that did like a man who has learned to circle a thing when the only word he\u2019s got is maybe. He said Daniel\u2019s name with tenderness that made Dodge\u2019s skin try out a new kind of crawl. He said sorry with a sincerity that would have fooled a kinder woman and an ambitious lawyer. He said soldier again, once, like he was checking to see if it still fit her.\n\nWhen it was her turn she took the room into her mouth and made sure it knew who owned it. She put the card from the wall on the table and didn\u2019t push it toward him and didn\u2019t make a sound when his eyes flicked and stuck like there was glue and God in there. She set the brush down next to it. She laid the receipt from the art store in its sleeve. She kept the picture of his father\u2019s front porch for later because mercy becomes weapon if you use it and she didn\u2019t want to. She watched his face soften when she chose fact over theater. She put the pictures of Daniel\u2019s text string in a row and left spaces between them so the silence could say what it needed. He made a sound then that wasn\u2019t a laugh and wasn\u2019t not, and she told herself to put that sound in a jar, label it, never let it out where it could make weather.\n\n\u201cYou like the line more than the man,\u201d she said, and he was so grateful to be understood in that small way that his shoulders came down two centimeters, the first honest thing he had done in a week except put a brush in a sink for her. \u201cYou like the part where the brush behaves under your hand more than the part where a person breathes. You think yes and no are the only colors and maybe is your mixing room. You take boys and you turn them into a medium and then you tell yourself that is mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see me,\u201d he said, amazed like a child, insulted like a man.\n\n\u201cI see how much you need to be seen,\u201d she said matter-of-fact. \u201cDon\u2019t get romantic. It\u2019s ugly on you.\u201d\n\nHe told his story because they always do. They have a version ready for when someone they respect asks the right shape of question and he thought she respected him because she hadn\u2019t shot him off a roof. He told her about the art walk where a girl had asked him to put paint on her face and then said maybe and then laughed and then kissed a boy who wasn\u2019t him and he had gone home and put his hand on his own mouth to remember what it felt like to be wanted and then taught himself how to make the line so clean he could live inside it. He told her about Skye, not the counselor, the other one, whose classroom smelled like black coffee and tired fabric and hope, who had said maybe as a way to say bring me something better than yourself and he had brought her the best color he had and she had said no, later, wait, not now, and it had made a country in him and he had moved there and given it a flag. He told her about the father and the ladder and the sound tape makes coming off paint and how satisfying that is and how if you can\u2019t have that there are other sounds you can make that nearly replace it.\n\nShe didn\u2019t give him the empathy he wanted now. She gave him paper. Forms. A pen. She gave him a box full of his own edges and told him to live there until a lawyer came to teach him other vocabulary. She let him waiver on a question she had no legal business asking because it would scratch the itch inside her he kept finding. She asked him if Danny had ever said no in a voice he could understand and he said he said maybe and I loved him for that, and she said thank you because that was the tiny admission that would turn into a rope later. She stood and left him the room as a consolation prize he didn\u2019t deserve and made herself down the hall and held onto the railing outside until her breath learned a new song.\n\nOutside the interview rooms, the precinct was tired. Davenport ate pizza with the careful fury of a man whose family is asleep in a house he pays for by ignoring them too many nights. Rhea came in with a list of what the brush would say for them in a judge\u2019s light. The captain wrote an email that looked like a tree if you squinted and she knew it was to the mayor and the subject was not art. Quinn took off his scarf and used it as a pillow without shame, and the fabric made a little mountain under his head. The printer jammed like a small rebellion. The coffee laughed at everyone.\n\nShe texted Skye Delaney because she owed her that and because she didn\u2019t want the news to be delivered to that woman by a screen she didn\u2019t choose. Skye wrote back a sentence that could only have been written by someone who lived inside art and barely tolerated police: We will hold a critique for consent in the morning; you can come or you can send me that portion of your budget. She liked Skye for that square jaw in her words. She told Skye yes not because she had money but because yes is a tool when you can make it do small things.\n\nOn her way out into the kind of night that knows it will be replayed for all the wrong reasons, she walked past the evidence room and looked in because she is a superstitious animal and likes to say goodnight to the things that made her day livable. The brush sat in its bag like a small king without a throne. The paint cards made a fan she could have put her face behind and learned a little bit of who she still was. The turquoise bottle she\u2019d bought sat in her own desk\u2019s drawer where she\u2019d left it, ridiculous and heavy and buckled in, and she considered throwing it away and considered drinking it and considered giving it to a child to make them messy and then shut the drawer because none of those solved anything.\n\nQuinn walked her to her car because that is the stupid ritual you observe when you\u2019ve almost died and didn\u2019t. He kept his hands in his pockets because he is a boy in that way and because he didn\u2019t want to make the shape of touch in the air where other eyes could call it something. He said, \u201cYou did good,\u201d and she did not reject it because sometimes men get to say things that feel like blankets and it\u2019s not insulting when they do. She said, \u201cYou didn\u2019t get shot,\u201d and he laughed the tired laugh again and said he was saving that for sweeps.\n\nHer phone buzzed while the heater failed at its job. The number was new and it shouldn\u2019t have been able to reach her and everything in her body that had finally sat down stood back up. She answered because she is obedient to her own rules. It wasn\u2019t him. It was a mechanical voice that wanted to be human telling her there was a collect call from the county jail and did she accept the charges and the spite of the system made her say yes because the only thing worse than hearing him from there was wondering which fish he was going to feed with his words.\n\n\u201cNicolas,\u201d she said like she was telling a chair what it was.\n\n\u201cI thought of one more thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI forgot to tell you that I never liked turquoise.\u201d He stopped because he needed the effect. He stopped because he thought it made him a poet. He stopped because this was the part where he tried to keep owning the brush. \u201cI did it for you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt looks good on your wrist.\u201d\n\nShe hung up on him and put her head on the steering wheel like a woman who had just been asked to stay politely. She wiped at her skin and there was nothing there because she had washed it off hours ago, but the body keeps old paint. She drove home carefully because care is the only rebellion she had left that didn\u2019t cost paperwork, and the city laid itself down beside her over the bridge with its lights and its old trains and its boys and its maybes and its small quiet beautiful nos, and she believed for one stretch of straight road that all of that had been enough to make this chapter end.",

Morning slid along banisters and decided to live for a minute on the long faces of portraits painted to look like men were large on a moral scale. The hallway had the strange hush of rooms full of people who have agreed to be quiet so the building will like them. Dodge stood with a coffee she didn\u2019t drink and watched the little theater set pieces roll by: a public defender flipping a file with his thumb the way gamblers carry a deck, a bailiff whistling under her breath like she was trying to teach a tune to a stubborn dog, a mother in a coat two sizes too thin holding herself through the elbows so her hands wouldn\u2019t go loose and break something.\n\nNicolas came in cuffed and averaged and did that thing, chin up enough to say he thought his neck was involved, eyes looking for the camera he could love. He had on the jailhouse orange that insists it is a joke until it isn\u2019t, and under it he wore his ordinary, the posture of someone who has learned to keep the top half of his body charismatic while the bottom half learns escape routes. He caught her in the crowd and let his mouth turn a fraction, not a smile, more the private sign men make to each other when the joke is the room. She didn\u2019t look away because not looking away was one of her flags, and anyway it didn\u2019t give him anything he didn\u2019t already believe he owned.\n\nThe judge wore her robe like it had been ironed into her at birth. She read the words they all knew she would read and made them sound like new because this is the work of people\u2019s voices when the law gets itself into a room\u2014repeat after me until the heat leaves it. The words had their narrow shoulders all in a row: second-degree murder, abuse of a corpse, tampering with evidence, unlawful restraint. A whisper went through the gallery like mice testing a wall. The public defender leaned in to Nicolas and said something short, the shape in the air of don\u2019t say soldier, don\u2019t say art, say nothing at all, and Nicolas did not nod because nodding is what you do when you obey.\n\nBail was a theory and then it wasn\u2019t. Denied because sometimes the city remembers itself. He looked back again, over the shoulders of the men who owned his wrists, and his mouth formed a word she didn\u2019t let herself lip-read. Maybe, of course. Maybe he said sorry because the syllables move the same. The room breathed and moved on.\n\nOutside, the cold had sharpened its teeth and bit in the place where the collar meets the neck because winter likes the weak seam. She put her shoulder against a column and watched a bicyclist pretend laws are for other kinds of wheels, and Quinn came up with a paper bag and a grin that had learned to show only the front row of his teeth. \u201cBagel,\u201d he said, a man making peace offerings to a woman who didn\u2019t eat when she needed to. \u201cSkye\u2019s thing is at ten. The kids are already posting about it like they invented critique and this time it matters. You coming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing my sorry,\u201d she said dry, and he didn\u2019t say don\u2019t because there are times when men know better than to rescue you from your own line.\n\nThe Livery had dressed itself like a promise. They had put chairs in a circle that made room for someone indecisive, they had opened the high doors that let the light decide to be generous, they had brewed coffee in a machine that sounded like a freight train but delivered warmth like a midwife. On the chalkboard someone had written: CONSENT IS AN ART PRACTICE. Underneath, in small careful hand: and a policy. Skye moved through the room like she owned it and didn\u2019t; she reached to touch shoulders without touching, tipped her chin at the shy ones so they would step into the light if they wanted it, saw Dodge in the doorway and gave that little flicker of a smile that says I see you seeing me and neither of us is here as a mascot.\n\nThey started with breathing because people always forget how when they\u2019ve been spoken about. A boy with a glittered thumbnail said he\u2019d never had a cop in a critique and did he have to speak differently. A girl with a shaved head said we\u2019ll make the cop do the work and her smile took the sting out. Skye stood at the front and did not take the front; she took the role of the person who names the thing. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she said, the word pilling under her tongue like a sweater you love too hard, \u201cis not a stage direction. If you\u2019re working with bodies, yes is a sentence and it\u2019s either present tense or it isn\u2019t consent. We treat maybes as no until they arrive wearing a different coat.\u201d\n\nThey passed around a box of index cards like communion. Each had a word printed and blank space under it. Sorry. Wait. Now. No. They wrote on their cards and then read, not to be graded but to let the air hold it. A sophomore who wore her dead grandmother\u2019s ring like a knuckle said she had a bruise of turquoise under her nail still and she didn\u2019t know how to feel about wanting to keep it. A boy with long hair and a mouth like a trouble song said he\u2019d been asked to pose and he\u2019d said maybe and then he\u2019d said no and then he\u2019d said sorry because men always want the last word and he was tired of keeping them company. A kid Dodge remembered from the wall\u2014hat too big, coat thrifted into dignity\u2014said he had painted with Nicolas two years ago and nothing bad happened and he still felt like he\u2019d been walked to the edge of something and shown the view.\n\nSkye held the room when it started to tilt. \u201cWe\u2019re not Nuremberg,\u201d she said, and the laugh that went through the circle made it back to her like gratitude. \u201cWe\u2019re not tribunal. We\u2019re learning how to ask and answer in a language that keeps our bodies ours. If police want to take notes, they do it without making a mess.\u201d She looked at Dodge with kindness edged in steel. \u201cYou can stay without owning it. Or you can talk. Your choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to listen,\u201d Dodge said, and kept her hands quiet on her knees. The room made a small sound at that because you can trust a woman who knows which part of the sentence to swallow.\n\nAfter, the kids brought her a pile of names as if names were ransom and she was the kidnapper willing to bargain. Jae came up like a shadow making a decision. They had hair that didn\u2019t tell you a pronoun and a voice that had learned how to be heard by forcing interesting onto it. \u201cHe asked me to be a second,\u201d Jae said without preamble, eyes on a point over Dodge\u2019s shoulder where a wall had learned to be looked at and not noticed. \u201cLike a diving meet. Safety friend. He wanted me to hold, not to watch. I said yes and then I said no and then he said maybe like it\u2019s a wet blanket you throw on a fire and I left because I like when rooms keep belonging to me when I go,\u201d they added, almost cheerful with survival. \u201cHe\u2019s been around. He\u2019s built for other people\u2019s edges. You have a list already, but I have his side doors. He goes in through supplies.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupplies,\u201d Dodge said, hearing in it all the synonyms\u2014excuses, tools, love letters.\n\n\u201cHe hangs around the aisle at the big box with the fancy wall paint, talks to people who hold their color cards too long,\u201d Jae said. \u201cHe says things about undertones like he\u2019s flirting with the idea of being useful. He offers to teach you to cut in freehand because tape is for girls and then he says he\u2019s kidding and then he says sorry and buys you a cheap brush because he thinks poverty is a vaccine against future crime. He got your boy at the south steps, right. He likes stairs. It\u2019s theater seating.\u201d\n\nThey scribbled a map on the back of a handout for a ceramics sale, X marks the stupid places Nicolas had liked to hang his talent and wait for someone to costume it. Dodge folded it and put it in the side pocket where future becomes now. She left a note on Skye\u2019s table that said thank you because it was a spell worth saying in rooms that teach and destroy in equal parts.\n\nThe captain called when the sunlight had decided to be unforgiving and had sent the dust in the Livery into frantic choreography. \u201cFamily notification,\u201d he said, and there was apology in the back of his throat because a man like him will never not hate this part. \u201cYou should come. She asked for a woman when Davenport said \u2018detective\u2019 and he didn\u2019t correct her. He couldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDaniel\u2019s mother lived in a house that was in a polite argument with its lawn. The winter had made a decision and the yard had not been allowed to have one. She had oranges in a bowl because that\u2019s what mothers do in winter when they want the idea of sun inside their rooms. The couch had a throw blanket that tried too hard and a cat that didn\u2019t, and the photo frames did the thing of only holding the moments you\u2019d planned to live and didn\u2019t. Davenport sat on a chair he looked too large for and held his hat in his lap like he was a boy in church who had been asked to behave his body.\n\nShe brought them tea without asking if they wanted it. She set the cups down on coasters that looked like little pieces of geography, cork islands against spill. She looked at Dodge like she might tell the truth if someone else did first. \u201cThey said you caught him,\u201d she said, and her voice had the tone of someone talking on the phone while turning off burners. \u201cThey said it was on the news. That doesn\u2019t make my boy less hard to look at when I close my eyes, so you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe caught the man we believe did this,\u201d Dodge said, and she wished the English language had a tense for certainty that could still be kind. \u201cThe person who made Daniel stop.\u201d She used his name like chalk on a blackboard, it held shape that way. \u201cI am sorry. I will keep being sorry as long as it\u2019s useful. If there is anything you want to know that doesn\u2019t make you bleed, I will answer.\u201d\n\nThe woman\u2019s mouth made a small practical line and then a twist, and the twist was the hard part. \u201cWas he alone,\u201d she asked, and Davenport opened his mouth to fall into the scripted holes and Dodge put her hand on the coffee table not touching him, touching the wood, to say let me. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe so,\u201d she said. \u201cWe think he had help with logistics, not with intent. There are people who will need to live with their names for a while in ways they didn\u2019t choose, and we are going to make that as small for them as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d the woman said, and then the porches of her face collapsed at once and she was suddenly younger and older. \u201cHe liked blue when he was little. He\u2019d make the sky wrong and I\u2019d say baby the sky isn\u2019t that color and he\u2019d say maybe it is in our neighborhood. I kept one of the pictures. It was on the fridge until the magnet got tired,\u201d she said, and she made herself stand up to go get it because grief makes you get up for the strangest chores and obey. She came back with a paper that had lost its crisp and handed it over with pride like a mother hands a diploma. The sky was a wild wrong blue and the sun was a square and there were three figures at the bottom, two tall and one small, and the small had a smear between its shoulders like a wing. \u201cI want to not hate that color forever,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t help me do that, but I thought I\u2019d say it out loud so God would have to hear me.\u201d\n\nShe saw them out with the politeness women learn from being asked to be hospitable to their own hurt. On the porch, the wind took a run at Dodge\u2019s knees and she let it because fighting the weather doesn\u2019t make it less weather. Davenport stood on the walk and practiced a sentence into air he didn\u2019t mean to say to anyone and then swallowed it and looked at her like a man who had carried a piano by himself up a flight of stairs and decided he could do it again if she asked.\n\nBack at the building that was supposed to fix things, the phones had discovered more ways to ring, which is what happens when a face gets on television. A woman insisted she had been painted turquoise by her boyfriend as a surprise and that made him a suspect and then she cried because she wanted to confess that she had liked it, and someone wrote her info down in case liking could be used as evidence somewhere later. A boy with a voice that broke in two places said he had walked under the bridge and saw the bottle and thought it was pretty and took a picture and then felt like a murderer because beauty had talked to him, and she told him to email the photo anyway because beauty sometimes keeps the widest angle. A man from out in Dickson called to say he once tutored a Nicolas Harlan in GED math and he always did his edges too neat on graph paper and what did that mean about a soul.\n\nThey put Nicolas in a room with his public defender that smelled like state budget and sob stories, and he played with the paper cups like he was a child again. He wrote a letter that he couldn\u2019t send because it wouldn\u2019t help him and put it in his shoe because men do that; they like secrets that sweat. He called and asked for her and twice she didn\u2019t answer and the third time she did because you can\u2019t pretend a river isn\u2019t on the far side of your house if you can hear it from the yard. \u201cWhy are you there,\u201d he asked, as if she were the inmate. \u201cYou could come sit with me and look at the ceiling until the paint makes animals.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I have a cat,\u201d she said, and it was true in the way that makes men angry because they want myth and you give them errands. \u201cBecause work expects me to finish what I start. Because not answering you is a choice I get to make.\u201d\n\nHe was quiet long enough that she thought the call had already cut. \u201cDo you wear the wristwatch on the left,\u201d he asked finally, small as a boy invited to sit at the bar, and she hung up on him with all the relish she allowed herself and set her phone face down on the file that had learned how to get heavy.\n\nAfternoon practiced being night on the faces of buildings and failed and practiced harder. A crew in city vests came to the wall with a power washer and a tarp and a man with a face that had forgotten how to hope, and three women in puffer coats stood in front of the turquoise sentence with their arms threaded like fabric, and Skye arrived with a bullhorn she hadn\u2019t asked for and a speech she hadn\u2019t written and a kind of authority that some people are born to and some people teach themselves. \u201cWe\u2019re not saving a vandal,\u201d she said to the men, who had learned to speak in clauses that contained liability. \u201cWe\u2019re protecting a conversation.\u201d They stood there breathing fog at each other until the man with the hose remembered his daughter\u2019s braces bill and lowered the nozzle half an inch, and the women took a step forward the way people in small towns take pies to porches, and someone on the phone at City Hall said hold, hold, hold, and the wall stayed decorated. Below, someone had added a third line in marker that would not last the rain: WE ARE NOT YOUR CANVAS.\n\nAt her desk, the machine in Rhea\u2019s hands turned the brush into a person with a social security number. \u201cI\u2019ve got your boy on the bristle,\u201d she said, almost triumphant, and rolled her chair back to look at Dodge like a magician who still believes in science. \u201cEyelash, skin flakes if you like uglier words. Daniel is in the seam like a memory that has learned glue. He can talk for you from there. It\u2019s not pretty and it\u2019s exactly enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Dodge said, and let the good live in her mouth for a second longer than she\u2019d meant. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to go farther back. If there are others, they might be living their lives not knowing they\u2019re in a category. He said practice. He\u2019s not good enough to have started at Danny.\u201d She heard the sentence and the little spine of cruelty that runs along the top of the truth and she swallowed it because accuracy matters even when it\u2019s an insult.\n\nRhea flipped through printouts with a finger that had a glitter of blood under the cuticle from a cutter and ignored it like lab people do. \u201cI pulled five incidents with turquoise weirdness in them from the last three years that weren\u2019t blamed on teens with time to burn,\u201d she said. \u201cTwo were dismissed as prank art and one as a wellness check that didn\u2019t need to be, and one is in your old friend Davenport\u2019s pile from last spring when a boy walked into Saint A\u2019s on Palm Sunday with blue paint under his collar and said he needed to confess something that wasn\u2019t sin. He gave a name. It wasn\u2019t Nicolas. It was a person who doesn\u2019t exist unless you know where to look. Blue. Cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlue shows up on his contact list,\u201d Dodge said, and got the special little hit in her chest that feels like an elevator arriving at the right floor. \u201cSo we\u2019re looking for a shade, not a person. A supplier, a second, somebody who likes being in the room when a man reminds himself he\u2019s important. We find Blue and we find the corners he\u2019s been practicing in.\u201d\n\nThey went back into footage the way people go back into dreams they didn\u2019t understand\u2014hopeful, a little embarrassed. The lobby tape yielded small graces when you watched it with patience: a scuff of dye on the heel of a hand, a piece of tape stuck to a jeans cuff like a forgotten vote sticker, the little boxy bag you only see on men who carry tools and don\u2019t call them that. They spotted the bag enough times that they made it a character and then followed the character through three corridors and two days, and eventually the bag hung from the chair in a coffee shop and the person attached to it attached to a face. Blue was not a color; Blue was a woman with a mouth full of secrets and a smile that had seen both sides of a church. She wore her dyed hair out of her eyes like she didn\u2019t mind what you thought about her decisions and set a brush down beside her latte like a person who won\u2019t pretend with you and then will.\n\nThey found her by the river because everyone does, and she rolled her eyes for so long that Dodge imagined it as a cardio routine. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, when the badge came out, and her voice did a slalom around contempt and landed on bored. \u201cHe gets famous, I get visited. He\u2019s a bowerbird at heart. He makes piles from other people\u2019s shiny and calls it a nest. He liked me because I\u2019m pretty on bad days and I don\u2019t make a show of knowing it, and also because I have a brain that can categorize undertones in my sleep. He thought we were a match. I told him maybe and I meant no and he heard a lifestyle choice. You want coffee. It\u2019s a day for paying for women\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nThey took the table that wobbled even when it promised not to and let Blue tell it in her order, which is how you get truths that stick. She had met him in the aisle near varnishes, of course, had laughed when he said tape is for people who don\u2019t trust themselves and then had bought two rolls of tape. He\u2019d shadowed her to the register and paid for a brush she didn\u2019t need and she had let him because poverty is a language and because she believed in interest-free debts. He had asked her to bring a kit to a shoot, called it a shoot like that had authority, and she had gone because she does that; she goes places with her eyes open. \u201cDo you think I\u2019m stupid,\u201d she asked, and when neither of them moved, she answered herself. \u201cI\u2019m not. I\u2019m curious. That looks the same from a distance. He made the boy into color. The boy liked it. That\u2019s true. He also made the boy into a wall to talk to and that\u2019s not okay. That\u2019s the part I got loud about. He didn\u2019t ask me back because I wasn\u2019t a mirror.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have dates,\u201d Quinn asked, making it into a small thing he could have in his hand. \u201cPlaces. Anything we can pin.\u201d\n\nBlue smirked like a woman who has saved all the receipts of her life without meaning to. \u201cHe liked basements that used to be bars and rooms with one good window and churches on weekdays when the door\u2019s open for the ghost of Jesus,\u201d she said, and she ticked them off with her fingers, old names and new ones. \u201cSouth steps always. A motel off Carroway that lets you do cash and not look you in the face. The Livery, before Skye told him to grow up and then smiled because she can do both. A house on Houston that used to be his father\u2019s friend\u2019s rental until his friend stopped being his father\u2019s friend. Hey. He never paid me. That\u2019s not your problem, but it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou left,\u201d Dodge said, and watched the way Blue\u2019s mouth filed that sentence under compliment with an option to appeal.\n\n\u201cI left when he asked me to hold the boy\u2019s face still while he breathed through his nose and I said how about if we don\u2019t, and he said maybe and then he said sorry so fast it sounded like a laugh,\u201d she said. \u201cHe likes the part where he puts his hand on a man and calls it caution and then gets to remember later that he was necessary. Men have built entire religions that way. You going to put me on TV. Don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want to be the girl who says boys do this. I want to teach a class where girls don\u2019t get in rooms where boys make them assistants for their crimes.\u201d\n\nWhen they stood to go she pulled a thing out of her bowerbird nest\u2014a paint card with a greasy thumbprint in turquoise on the back and the name of the color circled on the front. It said Poolhall Kiss in a font that wanted to be flirtatious and there was an A next to it, approved by the only committee that mattered to him. \u201cHe left it under my sink because he thinks I clean the way he does. He\u2019s bad at leaving no mark,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know that. That\u2019s why you like him. He\u2019s an easy man to find if you stop pretending he\u2019s a genius.\u201d\n\nNight arrived with its tray of old tricks and a new one he had built from inside a cell. A letter came on law office letterhead because he had learned that paper can be a key if you color inside the lines hard enough. It was folded with the care of a boy who still believed stationery can save you. Inside was a drawing on yellow legal paper in pencil\u2014not turquoise, as if he wanted to prove he could operate in lack\u2014a set of hands practicing a line, five strokes from fat to fine, the pressure map of a father\u2019s kitchen. At the bottom he had written in a version of penmanship that had tried to be saintly and fallen into neat: This is how you were made. Do you forgive me yet.\n\nShe did not show it to anyone who would mistake it for a threat or an apology. She put it in the folder where she kept the outliers, the things that are going to matter late and then make you angry that you didn\u2019t throw them away. She took Plank out of the bathroom sink where he liked to live because he imagined himself a fish and let him put his paw on the drawing as if that could baptize it into harmlessness. He yowled and she yowled back because talking to a cat is one of the safe kinds of madness.\n\nShe fell into sleep like a person learning the shallow end and dreamed of tape. In the dream, her father was alive and teaching tape, which is impossible because he hated it, and he showed her how to lay it so it would peel back without tearing the wall and he said you only get one clean, and she woke knowing more about tape than she had before and hating what that meant. The phone flashed once and did not ring, and she learned to read a light like a sentence.\n\nThe next day the city remembered that it had other crimes, other messes, other children to be gotten into school. Their case became an object you can set down if you have to wipe a counter, and she put it on the shelf carefully, not because she was done with it\u2014she never would be\u2014but because balance is not a suggestion; it is a tool you sharpen or it goes dull at the wrong time. Nicolas called twice and her voicemail took both messages and refused to translate them into text; some things are not made into transcripts without losing the temperature that matters. He left the word soldier the second time and then didn\u2019t speak and left her with a minute of the sound of a man thinking he is a storm.\n\nA kid with a scooter busted his lip in front of the precinct and bled onto the step where she had sat the week before thinking about the river. She took a napkin from her pocket like a mother in a pew and gave it to him and his mother said I\u2019m sorry in a tone that sounded like I\u2019m sorry for all of this, which is a lot for a city block to hold. In evidence, the brush sat while a chain of custody wrote itself into genealogy. The shirt hem swore harder that it knew who it had touched. The wall held its turquoise sentence like a bruise you have decided to live with so you can keep wearing dresses, and the second line, the angry one, the beautiful one, found cousins on three other walls in hands that weren\u2019t his.\n\nQuinn brought her a list of old cases that might love this one and she took it the way a woman takes a baby she didn\u2019t ask to hold and then discovers she\u2019s very good at. They knocked on doors that smelled of different kinds of poverty. They learned the names of boys who had been painted once and learned to scrub and kept their shame in corners that did not grow. They went to a church basement where an art therapy group had practiced being tender in a room with folding chairs and a coffee pot that burned everything it touched. A man there said he had been a canvas and liked it and then hadn\u2019t, and that\u2019s how he knew the difference between being adored and being arranged. He said sorry four times for saying it out loud and then laughed at himself until breathing was easier.\n\nAt lunch she saw Skye Benning on the steps of her building with a student sitting three inches too close because closeness is a drug you learn to take in doses, and Benning had her body arranged between the kid and the air like a gift and a wall at once. They talked without saying the parts that would make the talk too interesting. Skye told her she had a bookcase that was too full and that\u2019s what it feels like sometimes inside a head like hers, and Dodge said she had a drawer that held a bottle of turquoise and she couldn\u2019t decide if throwing it away would be a failure of nerves or an act of faith. \u201cKeep it,\u201d Skye said, and her face was not kind, it was exact. \u201cKeep it and choose every morning whether to open the drawer. That\u2019s the practice.\u201d\n\nIt should have stayed simple then, which is to say the size of a man. But the world is not a drawer you get to close. On a Thursday that saw fit to be spring for two hours before it remembered itself, a body was found under a billboard that wanted her to buy a mattress. No paint. No lines. A girl who sold shoes found him and then folded in on herself and called no one and then called everyone, the way people find religion in steps. The boy\u2019s face had been pressed into dirt and there were fingerprints of someone else\u2019s hand on the back of his neck, ordinary prints, not art. He looked seventeen in the way numbers sweat for boys like that. The city inhaled and held it while it decided whether to blame the turquoise for all of it. \u201cCopycat,\u201d someone said in the hall in that way which is really wishful thinking dressed up as clever, and the captain\u2019s mouth did the old-man thing and he told them to take their words to the parking lot and leave them running there.\n\nRhea came back from the scene with dirt under her nails and rage under her braid. \u201cNot him,\u201d she said, without turning it into a gift. \u201cNot his hand. The pressure is wrong and the print says a different story. We can walk and chew gum. I just want the city not to make one man a tent to live under.\u201d\n\nShe bought chapstick in the vending machine she never had change for because her mouth had decided it wanted a project. Back at her desk there was a drawing in her in-box, slid under the glass like an old school secret. A face in pencil, not the boy from the billboard, a different boy, the parts of a face you memorize first\u2014eyes, mouth, the tilt of the cheek where you\u2019d put your hand if you loved him\u2014sketched with the light futility of someone practicing being gentle. Underneath, in a hand that looked ten and thirty at once: He said yes. She sat with it longer than was strategic because there\u2019s strategy and then there\u2019s being a person.\n\nThey processed Nicolas\u2019s room again because if there is a place where a man keeps the keys he hands out to other people\u2019s houses, you go back armed with a new idea. Under the floorboard that had learned to creak at footsteps and keep secrets, Quinn found a envelope with a Catholic church\u2019s name on it that wasn\u2019t the one he\u2019d used for practice. Inside were five Polaroids from last winter, boys with paint on their shoulders like shawls, smiles in the complicated register between you and a camera and a person you want to be proud of you. Behind one, in a careful hand, he had written a date and that word\u2014maybe\u2014and beneath it in smaller script that wanted to be innocent: sorry for the mess. They bagged it all because paper is as loyal as you teach it to be. Her hands smelled like dust for two hours and she let them because there are worse perfumes.\n\nToward evening, when the city decides whether to be gentle or showy and usually splits itself badly between the two, she drove to the south steps because people are allowed to haunt places the way the dead do. The river had its Wednesday outfit on even though it wasn\u2019t Wednesday, steel and moving and uninterested in being beautiful for her. She stood in the place where she had nearly fallen and listened to the voices that pick up their own echoes. A woman in a red hat came and stood at the top of the steps and didn\u2019t sit. She said to no one, \u201cIf I could do it over,\u201d and then laughed at herself because grief turns us all into theatre people practicing our lines.\n\n\u201cDo you forgive him yet,\u201d Quinn asked later, in the stupid little kitchen area that always smelled like soup that had decided against itself.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and let the joy be in the fact of having it to say. \u201cI don\u2019t plan to. Forgiveness is a color nobody gets to buy at a store.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the paint,\u201d he said, because he is a boy who likes endings to have props in them.\n\n\u201cIt stays in the drawer,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery morning, I\u2019ll decide. Sometimes I will open it. Sometimes I will leave it alone. Either way it will be mine, not his.\u201d\n\nHe nodded and put the sugar in his tea like he always does, too much for a man who wants to be serious, and she watched his hand and liked him for the way it didn\u2019t shake. The building creaked because it is old, and the printer hiccuped because it is poorly made, and the floor grille rattled because it is attached to the air that keeps them all from noticing the small deaths they suffer daily. The phone breathed in her pocket and she didn\u2019t pull it out. The city exhaled. On the wall, under the turquoise and the asphalt and the small handwriting, someone had added in chalk, chalk that will go away with the next honest rain: WE PRACTICE YES WHEN WE MEAN IT.\n\nThat night he called and the line put his breath in her ear like a hand. He didn\u2019t say soldier. He said her name the way the cat says food. \u201cThey\u2019re going to forget me soon,\u201d he said softly, like he was recommending a playlist. \u201cYou\u2019ll let them.\u201d\n\n\u201cTry me,\u201d she said, even softer, and he waited for her to fill the silence. She held it. He hung up because he had nothing left that would keep his act from getting old and that is the worst thing to men who live on attention, worse than handcuffs, worse than rooms with chairs that don\u2019t move, worse than ceilings.\n\nIn the morning she drove out of her way to avoid all bridges because a petty private logic told her this was how you keep men in cages from walking through your head. She fed Plank and left the cupboard with its dot closed. She went to the wall with a cloth in her pocket and touched it to the turquoise and then didn\u2019t wipe, didn\u2019t correct, just pressed and lifted and left a print not of her hand but of the cloth. Maybe is a word with a hundred lives; she would not bury it but she would stop giving it citizenship everywhere. She walked back into her building with her feet loud on purpose and took her seat. The day bent its back and went to work, which is the only prayer she believes in when the rest of the city is practicing being art.",
