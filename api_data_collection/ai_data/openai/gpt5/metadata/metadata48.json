     "novel_text": "The first hour of my shift is always a kind of soft focus, a fog the color of the sea when it gives up trying to be blue. Coffee in a paper cup, elastic gloves snapping, the steady rhythm of the printer spitting labels like a mild insult. In Plymouth the gulls wake earlier than most of us, shunting their voices into the gaps of morning. By the time I turn the lights on at the pharmacy on Ebrington Street, the gulls have already held a full debate.\n\n\u201cMorning, Toby,\u201d says Janet, sliding through the back door with her tote bag packed like she\u2019s moving house. She\u2019s been here twenty-two years and knows everyone\u2019s antihistamines and anxieties by heart. She lays out her collection of herbal tea sachets and peers at the rain. \u201cWet again.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruly groundbreaking,\u201d I say. The first patient presses her face against the door before I\u2019ve unfastened the lock. It\u2019s that kind of day, all days.\n\nWe are a small outfit with an outsized stream of prescriptions. Pregabalin, warfarin, antibiotics like the words to a song. The methadone clients start trickling in, quiet, purposeful, the men with faces like closed doors, the women who talk too much about everything except the thing they\u2019re here for. I measure, I observe, I tick, I sign. When I speak I try to pitch my voice somewhere warm. Pharmacists are the middle shore between panic and plan. We translate doctors\u2019 handwriting and people\u2019s fears into simple instructions: Take one at night, with water. Keep taking even if you feel better. Do not mix with alcohol. The list of \u201cdo nots\u201d is a kind of prayer.\n\nAt ten thirty, Mum texts: Dinner at mine tonight? Bringing a guest. Smiley face, aubergine, which is Mum for \u201cI\u2019m being cheeky but I know you won\u2019t call me out on it.\u201d\n\nI type: I finish at six. OK.\n\nShe replies with a string of fireworks, possibly left over from Guy Fawkes. Mum is fifty-eight and lives on emojis; they are how she can send me love without using the word. She raised me with the prickly tenderness of a woman who married too young, divorced too late, moved cities just when I had made a friend. I always go when she asks. It\u2019s one of the few rules I\u2019ve never had to write down.\n\nBy midday the sun remembers itself. There\u2019s a man with a bag full of vitamins who wants to know if iron makes you mean. There\u2019s a boy with a bruise on his cheek buying plasters and chewing gum. There\u2019s a tourist couple arguing over ibuprofen strengths as if the wrong choice will break them. Janet taps the counter with a pen while the computer freezes, and says, out of nowhere, \u201cYou were a quiet one as a boy, weren\u2019t you? Did you have an imaginary friend?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had an imaginary me,\u201d I say, printing a label the size of a Victorian novella. \u201cHe was very chatty and always right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d She unpeels a blister pack with the care of laying out rosary beads.\n\n\u201cPlymouth. He got a job.\u201d\n\nI unlock the controlled drugs cabinet for the third time in an hour and catch my reflection in the door, stretched and warped by the glass and the angle. I look like someone raised underwater. People tell me my eyes are kind, which is like telling a chair it\u2019s sturdy. You can sit on kindness. It\u2019s useful. But no one falls in love with a chair.\n\nAfter lunch I ring a GP to correct a dosage. I counsel a man about inhalers, again. I watch a seagull sidestep across the pavement like it\u2019s crossing a tightrope. The telephone rings with its static squeal; a woman has lost her repeat prescription slip and needs \u201cit all again\u201d. I print out creams, pills, tablets, drops. If there\u2019s a rhythm to pharmacy, it is not the heartbeat, but the waves: incoming, outgoing, relentless, a tide of small emergencies.\n\nAt five I realize it is Thursday. Mum\u2019s new partner of nine months\u2014Gareth\u2014has a habit of saving his announcements for Thursdays. He arrived as a punctual smile in June and then settled, like a shelf bracket you don\u2019t notice until it\u2019s holding up all your plates. He\u2019s from Cornwall \u201cbut not really\u201d, tall, tidy hair, a man who irons T-shirts. He says he\u2019s a carpenter, which I suppose is why he always seems to be measuring the room with his eyes. He and Mum dance in the kitchen at random intervals to the radio, and when I walk in on them, he blushes like a schoolboy and Mum keeps swaying as if I\u2019m the one interrupting a waltz halfway.\n\nBy six I\u2019m locking the till and wiping down the counter with bleached determination. Janet leaves with her tote bag full of herbal tranquilizers and a pack of cheddar I bought from next door. She touches my arm. \u201cBe kind to yourself, love.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there an alternative?\u201d I say, and she laughs in that way that is half a cough.\n\nI step out into a sky that looks hand-washed. The air smells like bread from the bakery and diesel from the buses. My flat is on a thin street near the Hoe, one of those terraces that still have the original tiles by the doorway if you look closely enough. I change my shirt, splash water on my face, notice a new constellation of headache forming above my left eye, and leave for Mum\u2019s before the ache can settle.\n\nMum lives in a white-fronted semi near Mutley Plain, a garden that she has bullied into being mostly lavender and stones. The porch is an installation of umbrellas and shoes. Gareth answers the door, cheeks pink, tie loosened like the end of a sentence.\n\n\u201cThere he is! The chemist,\u201d he says. He\u2019s always over-excited to see me, and I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s genuine or an attempt.\n\n\u201cPharmacist,\u201d I say, because I cannot help it.\n\n\u201cRight, right. Come in. We\u2019ve got one of your favorites.\u201d He beckons me with the reverence of a gameshow host. Gareth\u2019s favorites for me include mashed potatoes, jazz that doesn\u2019t shout, and cider that tastes like apples instead of sugar.\n\nMum comes out of the kitchen with a tea towel over her shoulder and flour dusted on her nose like a cartoon cook. \u201cDarling! You\u2019re here. Kiss.\u201d\n\nI kiss her cheek. \u201cYou look like a snow globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect. Gareth, don\u2019t stand there like a lamppost. Go and fetch him a drink. He worked all day. All those poor people who think oats can cure gout.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot oats,\u201d I say, letting myself be folded into the house. \u201cWhole wheat.\u201d\n\nThe radio says something about tides and ferries to France. The table is set with mismatched plates because Mum refuses to buy new ones until the old ones \u201cfinish their journey\u201d. A vase of tulips leans all in one direction. I hear a voice from the hall, a male voice not Gareth\u2019s\u2014lower, slower\u2014say, \u201cDo I take my shoes off?\u201d\n\nMum\u2019s mouth squares at the corners. Her eyes flick to me and away. \u201cAh,\u201d she says. \u201cThe guest.\u201d\n\nGareth returns with two ciders and a glass of water, and a third voice stands behind him like a second doorway. He steps aside, and I see the guest.\n\nThis is what I notice: He is tall but not intimidatingly so; he has black hair cut short on the sides and left longer on top, like it grew wild then learned manners; his T-shirt is soft and looks older than he is; his eyes have the sort of color that makes the phrase \u201cstormy\u201d feel cheap. He\u2019s holding his shoes in his hand, uncertain what to do with them. He looks like he got lost in his own house. He smiles, and he has the kind of smile that is both a question and an answer.\n\n\u201cToby,\u201d Mum says, unnecessarily, as if she needs to remind herself who I am. \u201cThis is Kit.\u201d\n\nKit lifts a hand, wobbles it in a half wave, then decides to put it down again. \u201cHi,\u201d he says. \u201cI am... I\u2019m Kit.\u201d\n\n\u201cChristopher,\u201d Mum says, beaming at him as if he has just recited something memorized. \u201cI keep telling him it\u2019s a good name. Just like your granddad. But he says that\u2019s not who he is. He\u2019s Kit.\u201d She looks back at me. \u201cThis is Toby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said that,\u201d Gareth says, and then claps his hands together. \u201cAnyway! Dinner. Fish pie. And peas because I am traditional.\u201d\n\nKit isn\u2019t mean about the introduction like some people might be\u2014no roll of the eyes, no defensive shrug. He has a stillness that I envy. When he shakes my hand, his palm is cooler than mine. I wish I could catalog the smell of him in pharmaceutical terms: notes of soap and something more complicated. I hate the part of me that notices these things.\n\nMum goes to the kitchen, and I follow with plates because it is the task that keeps you moving without thinking. I whisper, \u201cWho is he?\u201d over the sound of the oven door opening.\n\nMum puts a mitt to her forehead like she\u2019s playing make-believe. \u201cWell. You know Gareth has a son.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, summoning the memory of some probationary conversations about the shape of families. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t see him much.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t. Now he is. Seeing him. More.\u201d Mum\u2019s eyes shift to the kitchen doorway and back. \u201cKit is\u2026 he\u2019s twenty-six, darling. He lives in Bristol. But he\u2019s here for a bit. He\u2019s going to stay with us. Just while he gets a few things sorted.\u201d\n\nThis is the part where the new information becomes a ceiling I\u2019ve just walked into. \u201cStay. In the spare room.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the airing cupboard,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s that face?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make a face.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made the face.\u201d\n\nGareth comes in with his standard bluster. \u201cEveryone ready? Good. Toby, bring the spoons. You love a spoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like accuracy,\u201d I say.\n\nIn the dining room Kit is standing like a polite piece of furniture. He\u2019s looking at the framed photographs on the wall: Mum and me on the Hoe in raincoats; Gareth pretending to be shocked by the size of a Christmas turkey; my grandfather in uniform, unsmiling, the past compressed into a grainy rectangle. There is a space on the wall where the sunlight fades the paint a shade; a picture is missing. I try not to take inventory of absences.\n\nWe sit. I take my usual place; Mum takes hers; Gareth sits at the head like he believes in lines of command; and Kit sits in the chair that my last girlfriend used to sit in when she came to dinner, one foot folded under the other knee, as if the furniture and he are negotiating terms.\n\n\u201cSo, Bristol,\u201d I say, because my brain chooses the weather of conversation. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\nHe pushes a piece of fish to one side of his plate, methodically like a scientist. \u201cBit of everything. Mostly small gigs with my band. Sound stuff. I help out at a print shop when we\u2019re not playing. I fix things that make noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very good,\u201d Gareth says, a bit too quickly. Pride is a sharp flavor in the air.\n\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Kit says to me. \u201cChem\u2014sorry. Pharmacist. They told me. Clearly I wasn\u2019t listening with my eyes open. Do you like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt keeps people from falling apart,\u201d I say. \u201cSome days I\u2019m a translator. Some days I\u2019m a detective for poor handwriting. Sometimes I feel useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you feel like a vending machine,\u201d Mum puts in, and kisses the air toward me. \u201cHe\u2019s very good with people. Always has been. Even when he was small and pretended not to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had an imaginary me,\u201d I say, because I\u2019m apparently in the business of repeating my own bland jokes.\n\nKit laughs, and he has a nice laugh. Not cleansed, not performative. It\u2019s the laugh of someone who doesn\u2019t share jokes to win. He looks at my hands, which are still and clean on the table, and says, \u201cDo you play anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cPills. And on alternate Thursdays, the spoons.\u201d\n\nHe smiles wider, and the conversation splinters into agreeable pieces: Plymouth venues, whether fish pie is better with egg or without (I lobby against egg; I always lose), the quality of silence in different rooms, what the light does on the Sound on a winter morning. He talks about music with a care that makes me think he could fix a song with a needle and thread. He has opinions about ceilings. He asks me questions like there will be a test later, but in a way that makes the test seem fair.\n\nWe finish with apple crumble that is more butter than fruit. Gareth takes plates away in pairs, and the radio plays something old and soft. Mum leans her head on her hand and watches me watching Kit and even that observation feels like a small betrayal. I\u2019m a pharmacist: I know how to label a chemical reaction when I see one. There it is: a little heat, a little change of color; the dissolving of resistance.\n\nAfter we eat, Gareth insists on day-old coffee and a tiny glass of port he saves for \u201cbirthdays and Thursdays\u201d. Kit and I drift to the living room because the chairs there are better at admitting tired men. The spare room door is ajar. A stack of cardboard boxes sits underneath the window, some marked with black marker. Kit picks up the top one, the way you might pick up a newborn, and remembers it is heavy, and sets it down again.\n\n\u201cYou moving in with an orchestra?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cBooks,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd wires that I\u2019m not sure did anything in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I say.\n\nHe looks at the spines peeking through the cardboard like they\u2019re gossiping. \u201cI figured I should leave Bristol before Bristol left me. My friend Callum said that sounded like something someone in a film would say when they were pretending to be brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I hear the question leave my mouth like it\u2019s looking for a coat to put on. I don\u2019t really know him. I shouldn\u2019t be prying. But also I want to hear his voice do something other than polite.\n\nHe shrugs, but it\u2019s not defensive. \u201cI kept building things that fell down. Kept choosing the same people. It got embarrassing. New place, new mistakes, you know? Dad said\u2026 he said there\u2019s room here. He said you,\u201d he gestures, vaguely, into the air between us, where a picture might hang, \u201cwere a good person.\u201d\n\nI am not quick enough to refuse the compliment. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh expectations make people petty,\u201d I say.\n\nHe turns this over like a coin. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem petty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait until you see me with a printer jam.\u201d\n\nHe smiles as if he is making a note. A gull shrieks in the distance like a kettle boiling over, and then everything is quiet in the way houses go quiet when they realize you might fall asleep in them.\n\nMum comes in, removes invisible lint from my shoulder, touches Kit\u2019s hair like he is not actually twenty-six but a boy with jam on his face. \u201cWe have a plan for the weekend,\u201d she says, as if she is issuing a royal decree. \u201cKit, you\u2019ve never seen Smeaton\u2019s Tower up close. It is the time for lighthouses. We will go. We will walk along the Hoe, and Gareth will pretend he is a tour guide, and I will spend too much on hot chocolate.\u201d\n\nKit blinks in the way people do when warmth is unfamiliar. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cYes. I like\u2026 towers that used to be elsewhere.\u201d\n\nI love him for that sentence, briefly and inexplicably. People reveal themselves accidentally. They say one true thing and the rest of the sentences make room for it.\n\nI leave before ten because mornings come regardless of who you loved the night before. I hug Mum and she squeezes me until I exhale more than the air in my lungs. Gareth claps my back. Kit walks me to the door, and there\u2019s a pause that feels like a hallway, that feels like both a risk and a courtesy.\n\nHe says, \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone here. That\u2019s not a complaint. It\u2019s\u2026 I just don\u2019t know if I will be good at it. Being here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of weather,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd boats. And people who tell their life story to the person who sells them shampoo.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me like he\u2019s taking a picture with his brain. \u201cYou\u2019ll show me where to stand so the wind doesn\u2019t make me into a joke?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can recommend walls,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd tea.\u201d\n\nHe nods. His voice falls into the soft register reserved for bedtime and hospitals. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nOn my walk home the pavements shine as if they have been carefully licked clean. The city is a series of corners I know too well. In the window of the charity shop there\u2019s a shirt that looks like something my father would have worn\u2014white with tiny blue squares, the compromise between boldness and a meeting\u2014and I almost go in to buy it, then don\u2019t. The hot breath of the kebab shop gusts into the cold. Near my street I pass a man with a dog wearing a hi-vis jacket that says I AM NERVOUS, and I nod at him like I am, too.\n\nIn bed I do not imagine Kit\u2019s hands; I am careful. I do not allow this to be a story about anything other than a new person at Mum\u2019s, a house with extra laughter and a depth of shoes by the door. I am almost thirty and I have learned to name my feelings in bland colors: concern, interest, the slight ache that comes with moving a new box into the house of your head. I tell myself, sternly, that there is a line and it is marked, bright as hazard tape.\n\nIt would be easy to say that I slept poorly because the mattress is old. It would be easy to say it was the wind. But the truth is, sometimes the heart resists scheduling. It wanders the corridors at night touching all the doorknobs, checking if they are locked.\n\nFriday comes like the sea, with that patient power. I shuffle my way through another onslaught of ailments. I tell three different people that a teaspoon is not a valid measurement unless it\u2019s an actual teaspoon designed for medicine, not something inherited from a grandmother who used it to stir memories. I counsel a teenager on the difference between moisturizer and magic. I call a doctor who forgot a decimal point; he laughs a brittle laugh and says thanks in a tone that means don\u2019t tell anyone. In the afternoon, a man brings in a prescription with his hands shaking, and when I offer him a glass of water, he refuses, but later comes back and buys a bottle.\n\nBetween customers I imagine what Kit is doing. Carrying boxes up the stairs two at a time. Opening and closing cupboard doors simply to hear the sound they make. Accidentally sleeping in the middle of the day because the silence has misled him. I hate myself a little for caring so easily. Quiet boys are dangerous that way; we stash affection like contraband and one day there\u2019s simply too much to hide.\n\nOn Saturday I meet them on the Hoe. The lighthouse is the same color it always is, as if nothing has ever happened to it, despite the fact that it was lifted up and moved like furniture. Mum comes at me with her coat flapping like a flag. Gareth wears a scarf he probably ironed. Kit stands slightly apart, hands in the pockets of a jacket the color of slate, watching the water as if the water might relay instructions.\n\nWe climb the stairs inside the lighthouse, round and round, stepping where so many feet have stepped, the smell of paint and salt and tourism. At the top the entire city offers itself: the Sound dark and full of secrets, Mount Edgcumbe hunched in its own green pauses, the ferries like ideas drifting toward France. Wind takes every loose thought and skims it into the water. Mum presses her palm to the glass and says, \u201cImagine keeping everyone safe just by shining.\u201d\n\nGareth talks about the engineering because he cannot help it. Kit looks at the mechanism like he could write a song about gears. Beside me he leans, very slightly, a degree, into the space where my shoulder is. We stand just far enough apart to call it coincidence. He says, \u201cDo you ever feel like you\u2019re walking around inside something that someone else made and you\u2019re trying to remember to say thank you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d I say.\n\nHe keeps looking at the horizon like it is a word he can\u2019t remember. \u201cI like it here,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to be dramatic. But I like that I can see the edges of things. Bristol felt like everything wanted to be bigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis place is a stubborn paragraph,\u201d I say. \u201cIt refuses to be rewritten.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me, then away, then back, as if checking the traffic. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I am\u2026 adequate in Plymouth.\u201d\n\nHe laughs that soft, true laugh. Mum takes our picture without warning. Later I see it on her phone: Kit and I not quite looking at the lens, faces turned toward each other and the light, no reason for anyone to detect any treason, two men who might be friends.\n\nWe walk, we eat chips, we let seagulls tell us we are wrong about everything. Mum spends money on hot chocolate she could have made at home, because Mum believes in making days feel like days. Gareth buys a fudge he will claim is for later and then eat on a bench. Kit tells me about his band and their current loss of a drummer. I tell him about Mr. Leland who keeps trying to get me to sell him antibiotics \u201cjust in case\u201d for his cat. He tells me about Bristol street markets, the way a crowd can feel like a song when you stand in it right. I tell him about a woman who comes in every Friday to buy exactly three cough drops and the way her hands shake when she counts change.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon he texts me a photograph of a bundle of cables: Do we think these are alive? I reply: Only emotionally.\n\nHe sends another. A book spine cracked down the middle: This was a bad idea. I say: All ideas are better with tape.\n\nMonday, he asks if I\u2019ll help him find a place to get a spare key cut. Wednesday, he arrives at the pharmacy with a box of biscuits to offer to Janet \u201cfor being the woman who has already told me to buy a proper coat\u201d. He stands at the end of the counter, out of the way, and watches me do my work with a focused curiosity, as if I\u2019m performing at a very quiet concert.\n\n\u201cYou were rude to the printer,\u201d he says afterward.\n\n\u201cThe printer and I are not on speaking terms,\u201d I say.\n\nWe walk home together along a street where the houses are all trying to be taller than each other. He tells me about his mother in Scotland, who texts him photographs of clouds and never uses punctuation. \u201cShe\u2019s a good person,\u201d he says, which I have decided is the most honest way to describe anyone. He asks me about my father and I tell him the bare facts: Leeds, once; a cabinet maker who didn\u2019t make any cabinet I ever used; a man whose laughter sounded like a door closing.\n\nWe fall into a kind of gentle orbit. He comes to the pharmacy at the end of my shift sometimes and leans against the doorframe like the idea of leaning was invented for him. He buys plasters just to have something to place on the counter, and calls me \u201cMr. Pharmacist\u201d in a voice that would get him served first in a crowded bar. We go to the pub with Gareth and Mum and share a packet of crisps like a treaty. He tells me a secret about a song he wrote in the bath; I tell him the names of the medicines that sound like planets.\n\nI set my boundaries like a picket fence I paint white in my mind. I watch myself obey them. I do fine until he says one night, in Mum\u2019s living room when everyone else has gone to bed, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could start again. Not a big start. Just\u2026 I thought I was too far into being me for it to be useful. But I\u2019m here, and I wanted to tell you that you are part of why that doesn\u2019t feel like a trick.\u201d\n\nI look at the carpet. One of Mum\u2019s tulip vases is crooked. My pulse behaves itself but takes off a jacket and stays a while. \u201cYou\u2019ll say that to a lot of people,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s your charm.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head, slowly, so I understand that he has considered it. \u201cNo. You are different.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here long enough to know that,\u201d I say. It\u2019s an easy lie to walk around.\n\nHe nods once, accepting my evasion like a gift. \u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll wait to know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d I say, and it is both a goodbye and a promise to survive until morning.\n\nAfter that, there are days when I think I\u2019m fine and days when a careless question rips something. Someone asks me at work if I have siblings and I say no automatically, as if I\u2019m still ten. Then I remember that life has a way of making new doors out of old walls. I don\u2019t correct myself. It\u2019s easier. If I don\u2019t name it, perhaps it rearranges itself into something harmless.\n\nAt the end of the month, Mum throws a small dinner for the way February dilutes into March. A new friend of Gareth\u2019s comes, a woman named Izzy with hair like a kind of celebration. We eat something with chorizo and lentils and laugh at the radio. Kit has a new shirt with space on it for more living. I help clear plates because it gives purpose to the hands. In the kitchen he stands too close because the kitchen is small.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel like you are making it up as you go along?\u201d he says, leaning against the counter, the good light making him more real than some days.\n\n\u201cConstantly,\u201d I say. \u201cI pretend to know where to put the knives.\u201d\n\nHe grins and then stops, his face thoughtful. \u201cI keep trying to think of good reasons to be brave. I think you might be one of them.\u201d\n\nIn the dining room a laugh breaks like crockery. Mum calls, \u201cIs anyone looking for the custard?\u201d and the window fogs slightly with the heat of boiling water. The house is so alive with us you could put a stethoscope to the wall.\n\nI say, because it\u2019s the only thing that doesn\u2019t feel like a theft, \u201cI like that you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nHe breathes in, as if someone opened a door in him to a colder room. His hand lifts like it might press mine; it doesn\u2019t. He nods as though to commit the sentence to memory. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\nAfter the guests have gone and Mum and Gareth have done their affectionate choreography down the hall, I sit on the sofa and listen to the waves in the dark. Kit sits on the floor, back against the coffee table, knees up like small hills. The conversation takes place in fragments. \u201cThere is a man,\u201d he says carefully, \u201cwho told me once that I was easy to leave. He meant it as an apology. I took it as a threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was not kind,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cIt was accurate, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. I only met you when you were already staying.\u201d\n\nHe tips his head, that acknowledgement you give someone you weren\u2019t expecting to meet on a path. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying. I\u2019m not\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlive,\u201d I say. \u201cThat seems to be the general trend.\u201d\n\nHe laughs again, the laugh I would keep in a jar if I could. Then we are both quiet, and there\u2019s a current in the room like the kind in a river, the one that looks slow and is not. Everything that is not a choice tries to make itself known. We sit inside a small, dense moment where any sentence could be a bridge or a wall. We choose neither. Sometimes not choosing is its own kind of courage. We say goodnight in a voice that belongs to a different story, and go to our separate rooms, and sleep like men who have built something out of air.\n\nBy April, we have a pattern. On Mondays we eat with Mum. On Tuesdays we walk down to the barbican and count how many couples hold hands. On Wednesdays he sits in my tiny kitchen and tells me how a song becomes a room you can enter. I tell him how a pill knows where to go. On Thursdays we pretend we are not disappointed when the evening is ordinary. On Fridays we watch a documentary about lighthouses and both pretend not to notice the subtext. We don\u2019t touch because there is a line and we respect lines, even when they wander.\n\nHe starts picking up shifts at a music shop near Royal Parade, the kind of place where you can buy a dream for ninety-nine pounds and carry it home in a case. He comes to the pharmacy afterward and smells like guitar strings, as if metal could have a scent. We talk about the woman with three cough drops, about Gareth\u2019s habit of hiding biscuits at the back of the cupboard and then not remembering. Mum invents reasons for both of us to be in the same room. I believe she might be a benevolent tyrant.\n\nAnd then one evening, because all evenings decide their own mood, Kit doesn\u2019t come to the pharmacy, doesn\u2019t text, doesn\u2019t arrive at Mum\u2019s. Later I receive a message: Sorry. Bristol thing. Tomorrow?\n\nTomorrow will be a different place. Tonight I walk down by the water because the city sounds the way my head feels. I think of him at the old flat, or with old friends, or confronting some old version of himself he would rather not see. The sea is the only thing that doesn\u2019t pretend to be brave; it just is. I sit on a bench I have sat on in three different years of my life, and I count the lights that blink on; I imagine asking him to be kinder to himself. I go home with my hands in my pockets like they might do something useful, and a gull whose tail looks like someone has painted over part of the evening keeps following me for a block, making a noise like a broken whistle.\n\nThe next day, when he shows up, his eyes are a little red around the edges like he\u2019s been walking in the wind too long.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask as neutrally as a pharmacist in the aisle.\n\nHe nods and then shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not a liar,\u201d he says, and smiles as if he\u2019s been caught. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I just\u2026 Bristol. It\u2019s hard to leave a place you could still fail in. You keep thinking, what if I fail somewhere else instead. And then you realize failure is an item you pack by accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave a seat,\u201d I say, gesturing at the spot on the floor behind the counter that is technically for staff only. \u201cI\u2019ve got two minutes.\u201d\n\nHe stands. \u201cIf I sit, I might stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe nods. He stares at the packets of paracetamol like they might offer counsel. \u201cDo you ever feel like you need to do something stupid just to prove you\u2019re not a piece of furniture?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrequently,\u201d I say. \u201cI use different words, but yes.\u201d\n\nHe pulls in a breath like a rope. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do something that my father will hate,\u201d he says, and his mouth shapes a smile that isn\u2019t one. \u201cI think I need to.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, because sometimes the job is to trust the person you can\u2019t fix. \u201cLet me know if you need someone to say stop.\u201d\n\nHe takes his hands out of his pockets and takes the little moment and holds it like a pebble. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re good at standing in the doorway.\u201d\n\nAnd that is how things go when they are going toward their own center. The decisions occur like weather. The afternoon goes by in blister packs and the itch of a too-small shirt. At closing time the printer jams and unjams itself as if it has its own narrative arc. I clean the counter until I can see my face in it. I turn the key and step out into an air that has decided to be clear. Somewhere in the city, someone is doing something they will regret. Somewhere else, someone is opening a box and finding the thing they forgot they bought. It is not my job to know which is which. It is my job to count the pills, to be kind, to lock the door.\n\nAnd yet, as I walk home, my steps are half a beat out of rhythm, thinking of Kit\u2019s breath and the phrase he used, like a warning to himself\u2014something his father will hate. I don\u2019t know the shape of it. I only know the feeling of it scraping against the inside of my chest, a tide turning, a boat untied.In the morning the gulls announce themselves like a faulty alarm I didn\u2019t set, and the sky wears yesterday\u2019s shirt. I unlock the pharmacy and the air inside has that small, clean hush, the sound of a room waiting to be useful. The printer eyes me with the suspicion of a cat and then starts, grudgingly, as if we have agreed to disagree. Janet arrives with her tote bag and her municipal cheerfulness, arranges her teas in a row like a tiny parliament, and watches me for a heartbeat longer than usual as I fiddle a label back into alignment. When I finally meet her look she tilts her head and says, \u201cYou\u2019re somewhere else this morning, love. Bring your body back or I\u2019ll bill you per daydream.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m precisely where my feet are,\u201d I say, which is technically true and emotionally adjacent. \u201cMy brain is doing inventory.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn what, feelings?\u201d She shakes a sachet like a maraca, then sighs when the kettle takes longer than a heartbeat to boil. \u201cDo not inventory feelings before ten. Company policy. Also, you\u2019ll come up short and have to cook the books.\u201d\n\nA woman who looks like she was once good at skipping rope asks for something for a cough she\u2019s had since Christmas and then requests a lipstick recommendation as if these are both diseases. A man with a plaster across his left eyebrow says he\u2019s here for his warfarin but leaves with a lecture on grapefruit. The methadone clients shuffle in at their quiet tempo, and I measure out what brings them level, then watch until the swallow has become a swallow and not a trick. When there\u2019s a lull big enough to leave a chair in, Janet leans against the counter and rubs at a smear of something imaginary. \u201cDo you remember that boy,\u201d she says, \u201cwho kept buying hair gel and condoms and Red Bull like a Courage Kit? I saw him last night pushing a pram. He looked bewildered and content.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember him,\u201d I say, and feel the odd displacement that comes when someone from your life exists loudly in theirs. \u201cHe always asked if mint made you sterile.\u201d\n\n\u201cA myth,\u201d she says, all professionalism. \u201cBut useful for some mothers of teenage boys.\u201d She finishes her tea and taps her fingernail on the cup. \u201cAnd you. Are you bewildered and content?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlternating,\u201d I say. \u201cI think the tide is out at the moment.\u201d\n\nShe squints at me in that way she has when she is measuring a dose without measuring a dose. \u201cWeather changes,\u201d she says, and nods at the stack of prescriptions like they are a deck of cards we are both pretending is fair.\n\nAround midday a man in a fluorescent jacket asks me to look at a rash \u201cnear but not on my important parts\u201d and we both do the dance of dignity that such requests require. A child buys a packet of jelly beans with coins that have clearly traveled through three trousers to get here, and tells me her rabbit is named Clover, which feels like a benediction. I call a GP to query a dose that would have knocked down a small horse and we share a minute of brittle laughter that acknowledges what could have been and is not. I move the day along with my hands and then, without warning, it is four and my phone vibrates in my pocket like an insistent thought. It is Kit, and his message is not a set of words I can file neatly: Can you come by after work. If you can\u2019t, okay. If you can, please bring your calm voice.\n\nI read it twice as if the second reading might reveal a trick. I tell myself he is asking because I am the nearest to hand, the way you grab the mug at the front of the shelf, not because it is your favorite. At six I lock the till with a little ferocity and Janet hums at me like a person who has chosen humming over meddling. \u201cTell your mum her lavender is bullying my sinuses,\u201d she says at the door, and when I say, \u201cIt\u2019s mine she bullies first,\u201d she grins and flicks my sleeve. \u201cKindness,\u201d she says, \u201cis not the same as softness. Remember that.\u201d\n\nThe walk to Mum\u2019s feels like a rehearsal for something I haven\u2019t practiced. The light is in that hour where it all looks like a photograph if you just hold still. Gareth\u2019s car is not in the driveway, which is a fact I put in my pocket like a mint I might need later. Mum answers the door with a rubber band around her wrist and a hair clip in her mouth, and she beams around the clip like a woman who can do four things at once. \u201cSweetheart. He\u2019s in the spare room. I am not interfering. I am simply adjacent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d I say, and she pats my cheek as if to acknowledge that saying nothing is, in fact, a lot.\n\nKit is sitting on the floor amidst the boxes like a man who has interrupted his own escape. He looks at me with a mixture of relief and apology and then gestures at the agglomeration of cardboard as if he might introduce us. \u201cI made a mess,\u201d he says, which is both true and a code for something else.\n\n\u201cI believe in mess,\u201d I say, stepping around a coil of cable that could have been a sleeping snake. \u201cIt\u2019s proof something is happening.\u201d\n\nHe rubs his fingers over the edge of a book as if testing its temperature. \u201cI have two options,\u201d he says, and then shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s rubbish. I have four, if I\u2019m honest, and I like none of them because they all implicate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds promising,\u201d I say, and sit on the edge of the guest bed, which creaks like it has been waiting to be included. \u201cTry me with option one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOption one: I stay here and try to become a person in a house and see if the house will have me.\u201d He looks toward the hallway where Mum is not listening, theatrically. \u201cDad would like that. It would make him feel like he threaded a needle he\u2019s been staring at for years. Option two: I go back to Bristol and do a thunderclap exit that convinces no one, least of all me. Option three: I find somewhere near here that is mine and then fail somewhere local. Option four,\u201d he says, and he swallows, which is a ridiculous act of courage considering the options sound like a maths problem with emotions. \u201cOption four is that I ask a person I like if I can borrow their life for a bit and see if I fit in the space they have. I think my father would like options that are not four. Which makes me suspicious of them.\u201d\n\nThe bed and I both become very still. The house, that collaborative creature, stops settling for a moment as if it knows the sentence that is about to be born. \u201cBorrow,\u201d I say, and the word is gentler than my pulse deserves. \u201cThe library is open but very small.\u201d\n\nHe laughs, quick and low, and then spreads his hands in surrender. \u201cI don\u2019t mean in a way that would make your flat less yours. I don\u2019t want to dig up your plants and replace them with my bad habits. I mean\u2026 a corner? A couch? A place to learn where the light switches are in the dark, with someone who won\u2019t find that pathetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a couch,\u201d I say, and my voice sounds like I have lain it out to dry on a line. \u201cIt is capable of being a bed if you are short, and you are only short in inches, not in any of the ways that matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad will hate it,\u201d he says, and the smile in his mouth sits strangely there. \u201cHe will think I am running away and running toward the wrong thing at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will think you are leaving his house,\u201d I say, and the honesty is a glass of cold water between us. \u201cHe has a right to have feelings. You have a right to have a door you can close. I can\u2019t tell you what makes sense. I can tell you I have clean sheets that do not match and a kettle that boils quickly.\u201d\n\nHe nods like a man who has been coaxed down from an edge by the idea of tea. We sit with the idea until it becomes not an idea but a possible Tuesday. Mum knocks in a manner that suggests she has never learned the art of not hearing. She sticks her head around the door and surveys us both with the fond caution of a woman observing two cats in the same room for the first time. \u201cIs anyone hungry?\u201d she says, which is her way of saying I approve, conditionally. \u201cThere\u2019s soup, which is also my way of admitting I forgot to make bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways hungry,\u201d Kit says, and he stands with that sudden grace he has, and the room breathes again as if it had held its breath on our behalf. We eat soup with spoons that have a million small scratches which, if you listen hard enough, sound like a history. Mum does not ask me what we decided because she can tell and also because she has decided that not asking is the kindest way to be nosy.\n\nThe conversation with Gareth happens later and is not mine. I leave when his key turns in the lock because I am not a spectator at that particular sport. On my walk home the lights in the terraced windows perform a lesson in other people\u2019s evenings. A woman stirs a pot with the kind of intent that suggests something else in her life is out of her control. A boy in a red jumper bounces a ball against the skirting board and will one day call this noise memory. A man leans against his kitchen counter and stares at the device in his hand as if it might deliver a verdict. I put my hand on my door and feel the little hum of electricity inside, the house already welcoming the idea that it will be asked for a favor.\n\nI clean in the way that means I am both nervous and polite. I shake out the throw as if it required negotiation. I find a set of sheets that don\u2019t argue with each other. I move my books so that there is space on the shelf for another person\u2019s spines to glance out. When the knock comes it is not tentative but not bold, either. He stands there with a duffel bag that looks like it has traveled across decades and a guitar case that looks like hope\u2019s luggage. His face is tired around the edges but his eyes are, somehow, steady. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hate me,\u201d he says, and a laugh that is only theoretically a laugh escapes. \u201cHe hated the idea. Which is progress. He said was I going to pay you rent and was I going to make you late to work. I told him yes and no and not in that order.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe loves you,\u201d I say, and take the bag from him because my hands need something to do other than reach. \u201cHe is learning the verb in real time.\u201d\n\nThe couch becomes a destination. We talk the way people talk when chairs are low to the ground and time is soft around the edges. He tells me about a memory of a kitchen in Scotland where the windows steamed in a way that made it seem like the house was breathing. I tell him about the time I got locked in the pharmacy stockroom and had to call Janet and we both laughed so hard we sat on opposite sides of the door like a scene in a farce. He looks at my shelves with the curiosity of a person who understands that books organize a brain. \u201cYou shelve by feeling,\u201d he says, tracing the air. \u201cThat\u2019s scandalous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a rebel,\u201d I say. \u201cNext I will put paracetamol next to the jelly beans and see what happens.\u201d\n\nWe do not talk about lines but we treat them with great respect. We do not mention the possibility that I could be an option five by accident. We fall asleep with a hallway of air between us and still somehow the room feels like a held breath. In the morning he apologizes for snoring and I tell him it sounded like a small, non-urgent engine and he looks at me like I have invented a name for something he thought had to be ugly.\n\nAt the pharmacy the day is brighter simply because it is formed of decisions made and not made for me. Janet notices the additional curve at the corner of my mouth and pretends not to. \u201cI dreamt about soup,\u201d she announces, which is how she says I am glad you are okay. A mother and daughter debate the ethics of dry shampoo. Mr. Leland attempts to extract amoxicillin from me with the persuasive tone of a man who believes repetition is charm. I counsel a woman through the unjustness of menopause side effects with a small pile of leaflets and the bigger, invisible thing of listening. At three Kit brings me lunch because he is sunshine in a jacket and hands me a box with \u201cI didn\u2019t know what you\u2019d like so I panic-assembled everything\u201d inside. We stand in the staff doorway sharing a fork like a treaty and he says, mouth full, \u201cI told the music shop I could do afternoons and not mornings and the man with the eyebrows told me mornings are when the good decisions get made and I told him that had not been my experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re brave,\u201d I say, and he shakes his head, then nods, then shrugs as if bravery is a jacket that doesn\u2019t quite fit.\n\nThat evening I show him where I keep the good mugs and the emergency biscuits and the drawer where utensils go to sulk. He showers and leaves the mirror fogged, and I wipe a circle in it with my sleeve, which later feels like a small intimacy I should not have enjoyed. He installs his chargers into the socket with the precision of a mission that matters, and I plug my phone in alongside his and watch the little lightning icon appear next to both our names and understand that\u2019s what it feels like when a routine absorbs you without spitting you out.\n\nMum, of course, calls. She manages to say how are you and is he settling and don\u2019t forget to defrost the sausages and your grandfather never minded a couch bed all in one breath. Gareth texts me a decent thank you in the tone of a man trying to drive a tight bend without braking. He is awkward and I am awkward and we both do our best to trust the other with our respective clumsiness. There is a relief in being old enough to admit that adult feelings require child language.\n\nDays accrue in their small, meaningful way. We develop systems without agreeing to call them that. His guitar case lives behind the chair with the wobbly leg which, in a charming coincidence, stops wobbling when leaned against. He buys pegs and uses them to clip my tea towels in a manner that suggests he knew they needed disciplining. I learn the sound of his footsteps when he is thinking and the sound when he is about to ask a question that might change the temperature of the room. He learns my kettle\u2019s mood swings and the exact noise the printer makes in my head when I am angry at it. We go to the supermarket together and become a parody of domestic joy, arguing about pasta shapes like we have been published on the subject. In the cereal aisle he lifts a box to the light and reads the ingredients out loud and pronounces them a work of fiction, then puts the box in the basket anyway. We are, in this way, building a story that threatens to believe in itself.\n\nOne afternoon, a Wednesday dressed up as a Friday, he arrives at the pharmacy at four and waits, hands in pockets, while I finish telling a woman about the noble and limited powers of antihistamines. When I am free he says, \u201cWhen you finish, can I take you somewhere?\u201d and his voice does that soft thing it does when he has planned something small that he hopes will loom big. At six we walk up to the Hoe, then past it, then further, until the city drops away like a polite curtain and we are on a bit of cliff that is not particularly secret but which the wind has claimed as its rehearsal space. He points to a fence with carefully spaced planks and says, \u201cThis is where I came the first time I got lost here. I realized if I could count the planks I could count myself here. One, two, three, not lost.\u201d\n\nWe stand with our backs warmed by the idea of the city and our faces stung by the fact of the weather. He says, in the tone of someone presenting a problem to a committee, \u201cI keep thinking about whether there is a kind way to make something that will hurt someone. I keep thinking about how \u2018kind\u2019 might be the wrong goal. Maybe I aim for true, and deal with kind like salt at the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalt at the end is wise,\u201d I say. \u201cSalt too early becomes the point. Are we cooking or mixing metaphors?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fishing,\u201d he says, and laughs at his own nonsense, then turns serious so fast it\u2019s dizzying. \u201cI want to tell you something my father will not want to hear, in a language he will understand. I don\u2019t know that language yet. All the ones I have are songs or apologies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could start with the one you speak to yourself,\u201d I say, and watch him as he measures that suggestion. \u201cIt will have an accent but it\u2019s the most honest.\u201d\n\nHe nods but says nothing and we let the wind say the part where we hug without hugging. We go home and the smell of the stairwell tells us which neighbor made curry and which bought cigarettes. He takes a shower and sings half a verse of something that hasn\u2019t had a chorus attached yet. I sit at the table and open a letter from the NHS reminding me that my body is a machine that likes being looked at on a schedule and, for the first time in months, I do not resent my cells for their insistence on being checked.\n\nIt happens on a Thursday because of course it does. By now Thursdays have become a space where news sits because it has nowhere else to go. We are at Mum\u2019s for dinner because the lure of mashed potatoes has bested my grown-up sense of proportion. Gareth is more quiet than usual, which for a man who is often a human trumpet is saying something. Mum floats around the table replenishing things that do not need replenishing. Kit not only uses his napkin but actually puts it on his lap without being told. The radio plays something from the nineties that pretends to be cheerful. When we have achieved the full rack of plates and empty bowls and the soft fatigue that comes after food has been kind, Gareth clears his throat in the manner of a man summoning an audience without wanting one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026\u201d he begins, and then he pauses to assemble his face, which is a better man than I am. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about how this last year, I\u2019ve been very lucky. I\u2019ve got a job that does not involve me swearing at idiots, mostly. I\u2019ve got a house where my shoes have somewhere to be. I\u2019ve got\u2014\u201d he gestures at Mum and he doesn\u2019t have to finish the sentence because he is not a fool \u201c\u2014and my son, the fact of him, which is not new but the having is.\u201d He looks at Kit the way carpenters look at a piece of wood that is both exactly itself and also possibly a shelf one day. \u201cI have\u2026 feelings about changes. I am trying to have them without shouting. I am trying to hold them and also not use them as weapons. I don\u2019t want to lose what I\u2019ve just got, which is to say, I am jealous of the idea that someone else gets you when I do not.\u201d\n\nKit puts his hand flat on the table, palm down, like a declaration without words. \u201cI am not an object,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut I know what you mean. I hate that I understand this from both ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re not,\u201d Gareth says and winces at himself like a boy caught being clumsy. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave this house because of me. But I don\u2019t want you to not leave because of me either. Christ, I\u2019m saying this badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it,\u201d Mum says, with the gentleness of a woman who knows the great labor of words. \u201cThat is not a small thing.\u201d\n\nI chew the inside of my cheek and taste metal, and I say nothing because this is not a scene where my voice is the correct instrument. Kit reaches out, flips his hand, and puts his palm up, offering it, empty. Gareth looks at it, then at his son\u2019s face, then some place above his head where guilt often perches, and he puts his own hand over it. They don\u2019t hold on for long, just long enough to agree that they have hands and that hands, used well, do not only fix wood.\n\nLater, in the kitchen, Mum pretends to wash three plates that are already clean so she can keep me there. She says, without turning around, \u201cYou know the thing where you think you\u2019re watching a play and then it\u2019s your scene and you have no lines?\u201d She turns then, and the light catches the silver at her temple she refuses to dye. \u201cThat\u2019s all that\u2019s happening. Don\u2019t be cross at yourself for not having a script. Your kindness is big enough to say no and to say yes. Use it for yourself as much as you do for other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am trying,\u201d I say, which is not a victory cry but it is also not an apology. \u201cI do not know where the edge is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt moves,\u201d she says, and hands me a towel that has become thin with being useful.\n\nWhen Kit and I walk home, the city is in one of those moods where it becomes a set, with lights and extras and the possibility of a plot twist. He says, \u201cThank you,\u201d and when I ask for what he says, \u201cFor letting me have a place to put down the part of me that wants to pick up everything,\u201d which is a ridiculous sentence until you have felt the exact weight of it. In my flat he stands at the window and leans his forehead against the glass as if he could breathe better if the pane would let him. I stand beside him, not touching, because that is our game, and after a minute he laughs under his breath and says, \u201cDo you ever get the sense you\u2019re about to be someone you remember later?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd then I look for small reasons not to narrate it like I\u2019m clever.\u201d\n\nHe turns, very slightly, which is the unit of measurement we use for great movement. He says my name in a tone I have not allowed to exist in this room and then stops, his mouth doing the brave thing of not finding a word quickly. \u201cI am going to do one more thing my father will hate,\u201d he says, and now the smile is not sad but also not triumphant. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do it kindly. If I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can try,\u201d I say, and my heart tightens like a hand on a railing. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him the truth about who I like,\u201d he says, and the sentence is in the present tense but it lands like a thrown stone finally arriving at a pond. \u201cI told myself I didn\u2019t need to. I told myself it was mine and none of his. But I\u2019m tired of pretending my life is polite. I can be kind and not be polite. And I would like to stop acting like all roads must pass through other people\u2019s tolls.\u201d\n\nThere is a very quiet noise in my chest that answers to relief and fear with the same name. I feel my face learn to be simple. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you want me there?\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head then nods then laughs at himself as if he has been caught in a loop. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cYes. No. I think\u2026 not for the telling. I think I need to speak my own language first. But afterwards can I come here and be with someone who won\u2019t translate it into something it isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can always come here,\u201d I say, and I mean it with the steadiness you bring to a promise you intend to keep until something larger than you says stop.\n\nHe kisses me then. Not like a theft and not like a trumpet. It is a steady thing, a sentence he has been practicing under his breath and has finally decided he knows. It is not a surprise and it is entirely a surprise and it is a hundred tiny, practical truths rewritten into a different order. I have been a steward of no for months and I do not feel like I am betraying him or me by saying yes in the language of a mouth. We both draw back like men who have stepped over a line painted on the pavement by no one official but visible anyway. He rests his head against mine for a moment and we both breathe, which is the only proof either of us has that we are alive.\n\nWe do not sleep badly but we sleep in a room where the air has introduced new rules. In the morning he eats toast like he\u2019s concentrating and I make tea like it\u2019s a decision. He goes to see Gareth in the afternoon because he says Thursdays deserve their consequence. I go to the pharmacy and do my job with attention because attention is the only way to keep from trying to skip ahead to a page that hasn\u2019t been written. Janet eyes me like a woman who has lived long enough to recognize when people have rearranged their furniture. When I finally tell her, in the smallest number of words, what is about to happen, she considers, then says, \u201cHe will still be his father when it is done. You will still be you. That is the only certainty. You do not get to pick other people\u2019s edges.\u201d\n\nAt half four I find myself staring at the clock not because the day is long but because the day is suddenly exact. At five, my phone vibrates on the counter with a message of three words that are not dramatic and somehow still are: Can I come. I text back: Yes, obviously, and then I wipe the counter down with such dedication that the spritz smell of lemon becomes a mood. He arrives twenty minutes later, walks behind the counter on the wrong side of a sign that says staff only and leans his forehead against my shoulder like that is the only part of him that needs to rest. I put my palm between his shoulder blades and feel the small, noble bones there and we both stand like that until it becomes ridiculous to be tender in a room that sells foot powder.\n\nWe walk home and he tells me the story as if it is a set of bruise colors. He says, \u201cHe did not shout and he did not clap. He did something worse and better. He said, \u2018Alright,\u2019 and then he said, \u2018Is it him?\u2019 and I said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter who it is; it matters who I am,\u2019 and he said, \u2018It matters if it\u2019s him because I need to know what kind of pain I\u2019m supposed to be feeling,\u2019 and then we both sat down like chairs someone had forgotten to put away.\u201d He breathes in the careful way of a man leaving a room that was humid with unshed things. \u201cI said it wasn\u2019t an accident, and it wasn\u2019t a phase, and it wasn\u2019t a trick designed to make him prove he was a good father. I said it was the way I am when I am not trying to be anything else. He said he wanted to be a person who didn\u2019t mind but that he was a person who minded and he hated that. I said I was sorry he was hurting but I wasn\u2019t sorry about me.\u201d\n\nWe turn onto my street and a dog in a little yellow coat leaps at a leaf like it is applause. He watches the dog with a small smile that might live in a museum. \u201cAnd then,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause he knows he isn\u2019t owed gentleness but he wants it anyway, he said, \u2018Will you be careful with him,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes, but I don\u2019t know what we are, so my care might look odd,\u2019 and he laughed almost properly and said \u2018Odd is fine.\u2019 We cried a bit and hugged like men who learned it on YouTube. Mum came in at the end with a custard tart as if she had been waiting and said, \u2018Well good then, that\u2019s sorted,\u2019 which was both a lie and a plan.\u201d\n\nWe climb my stairs as if we have never had to lift our feet before. In the flat he stands in the middle of the room like a person who has cleanly untied a knot and is waiting to see what the rope can do. I boil the kettle because sometimes progress needs assistance. He sits on the couch that is his couch now, and looks at the window and the lamp and the place where his charger lives, and his throat moves when he swallows and then he says, like a man deciding not to ask permission from the rest of his life, \u201cI would like to kiss you again. We do not have to call it anything. We can keep it in this room like an experiment that doesn\u2019t leave the lab.\u201d\n\nI put the tea down and the light from the window makes him look like a person in a painting about living quietly through storms. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say, and this time the yes has no other language upon it. We kiss like people who believe in instructions and like people who know when to ignore them, and it is both a relief and a complication and also not a disaster, which is an underrated category. Later we drink the tea and it tastes like something warm that might become a memory, and we sit with the door closed, which is not a metaphor but cannot help being one.\n\nWe do not call anyone. We do not tell a friend whose job it is to turn news into a round of congratulations. We do not pretend we are different men. We wash up the mugs and we choose a set of ordinary sentences to say next and we both practice how to breathe while nothing burns down. In bed I do not pretend not to imagine his hands; imagination is not a crime if you have an alibi of honesty. I name my feelings in the slightly brighter colors that come after you have admitted you have a box in your head and you have opened it. I tell myself that a line can become a path if you walk along it long enough and pay attention.\n\nIn the morning, everything is both the same and embossed. We perform our rituals with reverence because there is now a choir humming underneath. He leaves for the shop with his guitar case and his courage and a sandwich that thinks it is a meal. I go to the pharmacy with my kind eyes and my printer grievances and a growing acceptance that love, if this is what we are building, is less a lightning strike than a series of extremely competent flicks of a switch. At ten, a woman tells me she is frightened of her own temperature and I talk her down with a cup of water and the arresting fact that bodies like numbers but not numbers without context. At midday, Janet mutters \u201cWell then\u201d to herself and later confesses that her ex-husband has asked her to a concert and she intends to wear the red coat that makes her feel like a business plan. At two, a man drops his box of lancets and I crouch with him to gather them as if they are chess pieces.\n\nAt four, my phone vibrates with a text from Mum that is an art gallery of emojis and the words Proud of you both, which suggests I did not keep a secret as well as I imagined. At five, I close the till and the door and stand for a second in the little square of the shop that has held so many versions of me, and I let the moment admit that it is good. Outside, the sky remembers how to be blue, not because anyone told it to but because it is in its nature. The gulls are loud and wrong and absolutely themselves. I walk home with my hands empty and my pockets full, and in my head I am already making a shopping list that includes a second pillow and more tea and a practice of saying yes out loud when no one is listening so that when I need it, the word is ready.The week after the kiss behaves itself in public. We go on pretending we are very effective furniture movers, carrying small pieces of our lives from one room to another without dropping anything that would shatter. There are new objects that make claims on the flat\u2014his toothbrush that looks like it knows all the ways a mouth can be forgiven, a T-shirt draped over the back of a chair that refuses to be folded because it is occupied with smelling like him, a pick tin, round and rattly, washing up on the coffee table like something the sea forgot to swallow. My kettle begins to understand his timing and sings in a pitch that does not scold when he turns it off before it can be dramatic. We do not set rules because neither of us wants to write a contract with loopholes; we practice courtesy like a second language and keep finding new verb tenses.\n\nAt work, I let my body do what it knows. The controlled drugs cabinet responds to the clink of key and habit. The printer, surprised by my good behaviour, only sulks once by mid-morning. Janet whispers to the red coat she has hung on her locker door, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and the coat, which does not have ears, somehow understands the thrill of being saved for an occasion. A man brings back an empty methadone bottle, washed and gleaming. He places it on the counter as reverently as if he is returning a library book he did not dog-ear. I reassure a woman that her son\u2019s rash is not the apocalypse, just laundry detergent with a personality. The day gusts around me and I am, for once, not blown entirely thin.\n\nGareth texts me a photograph of a plank of wood and the words Could use a second pair of hands, and I know this is an olive branch he cut himself and sanded until the grain felt honest. I go after my shift with my sleeves rolled and my jaw unclenched. In the front room he has taken down a shelf that suffered under too many ornaments and replaced it with one that believes in load-bearing. He hands me a level with the ceremony of an oath. We work side by side without staging a truce, because the truce has already happened somewhere quieter. He measures the space in that way men like him measure love: in exact tolerances that will allow a thing to live where it ought to live without falling.\n\n\u201cIs it you,\u201d he says, midway through making the pencil mark, as if we are discussing the length of a screw, not the shape of a life. He does not look at me, which is both mercy and torture.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, and the word is neither apology nor trumpet. \u201cIt is me.\u201d\n\nHe inhales like a man choosing clean air over smoke. \u201cRight,\u201d he says, and the syllable is a person learning to accept the chair he\u2019s been offered. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ask if it was because I was afraid that it was and I would make an ugly shape out of that fear. I don\u2019t want to make anything ugly where there doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take something from you,\u201d I say, and I mean it in the complicated way. \u201cI am not a thief. I am not trying to be a replacement or an improvement. I am just\u2014I am someone he is, near.\u201d\n\nHe squints at the bubble in the level and waits for it to centre itself. \u201cI am not gracious yet,\u201d he says, honest to a fault that is already learning to be a quality. \u201cBut I am trying to be bigger than the bit of me that wants to slam doors. He deserves a person who isn\u2019t a hallway of shut things. You\u2019ve been good to him. I don\u2019t know what the right names are for us. But I\u2019m not going anywhere. And I will try not to be the man who makes every room into a contest.\u201d\n\nI put my hand on the wood, holding it steady as if steadiness is contagious. \u201cYou do not need to call me anything you can\u2019t say without chewing your tongue. We can be men who share a house where the knives go in the same drawer. We can give him a home he doesn\u2019t have to translate.\u201d\n\nMum brings tea in mugs that do not match and stands looking at her men and her shelf like a person who has been preparing for this domestic painting all her life without knowing what the colours would be. She kisses Gareth\u2019s hairline because he pretended not to need it. She squeezes my arm for a beat too long because she saw the way my shoulders sat. Later Kit arrives and the shelf holds a photograph of him at six, gap-toothed, a sticker on his jumper that says SUPER LISTENER, which makes all three of us laugh and then cough because truths arrive behind jokes like polite guests.\n\nThe next morning the pharmacy receives a surprise inspection, the kind of visit that makes even the responsible feel guilty by reflex. Two people in sensible shoes appear at ten-thirty with clipboards that have more confidence than some of the patients. We are a tidy ship most days; today we are a ship with laundry on the deck because I had just finished stock rotation and the counter looks like I am juggling antihistamines. Janet smooths her hair with the palm of her hand the way an actress prepares for a matinee, then steers the inspectors with that firm kindness of hers that implies the person being shepherded chose this path. I talk through the SOPs and the fridge temperatures, demonstrate the controlled register\u2019s exactness, and swallow the comment about the printer being our primary moral hazard. The younger inspector has the nervous energy of someone who has not yet realised they are allowed to smile; the older one takes her time, reads my counselling notes, and nods in a way that is not performative. When they ask about errors, I tell them the story of a near miss with a warfarin script from months ago, how we caught it, wrote it up, learned, bought a new highlighter not because highlighters save lives but because sometimes a tool is a reminder that you are paying attention. They leave with a decent report and a suggestion for my labelling; I breathe like a man who has put down a box he didn\u2019t realise he was carrying.\n\nAt lunch, Kit appears with a sandwich that has ambitions beyond itself and a grin that suggests he knows something he wants to spend all day telling me. \u201cI found a part for the amp that I thought was extinct,\u201d he says, biting into the bread like it offended him. \u201cAlso the man at the music shop told me about a gig this weekend. There\u2019s a pub on North Hill that lets you play a whole set if you promise not to scare the regulars. I promised nothing and he looked delighted. Will you come?\u201d He says it like a child asks, not because he expects yes as a prize but because he wants to hear the sound of the word made specifically for him.\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d I say, and see the exact way his shoulders change altitude. He leans in without touching and the part of me that spent thirteen years pretending to be a chair remembers how to be a person who can lean back.\n\nJanet watches us like a woman who has correctly placed a key in the correct lock. \u201cIf there\u2019s an encore,\u201d she says later, wiping down the counter with her small, precise violence, \u201cmake sure he doesn\u2019t do the shouting kind of music. My eardrums were in the war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were not,\u201d I say. \u201cThey saw the nineties from a safe distance and survived.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse,\u201d she says, and puts her red coat on as if the coat had been waiting for this line all its life. \u201cThey dated Malcolm.\u201d\n\nThe concert is on a Friday because the world likes to put declarations in front of weekends so they have somewhere to go. The pub smells like beer that has known better days and chips that wish to be taken more seriously. There is a back room that is really a front room with a pretend stage, and the amps hum like somebody\u2019s stomach, full of electricity and nerves. The crowd is a mixture of students who have not yet decided what kind of cool to be and people like me who have come to be told that noise can be arranged into balm. Janet arrives in her red coat with a man who is exactly Malcolm and also somehow less than the story I have been told, the way ex-husbands often are. He brings her a half pint with his body turned toward her like a plant to a window.\n\nKit tunes his guitar with that concentration that makes him difficult to interrupt without feeling sacrilegious. When he looks up and finds me he does not wave; he tips his chin in a way that makes me feel privately selected. The first song is one of those amiable numbers you can nod to without agreeing. The second slides itself under the bones behind my ears and catalogues something I didn\u2019t know I was missing. He sings the line about lighthouses that used to be elsewhere and a girl near me whispers, \u201cI love that,\u201d to her friend, and the friend says, \u201cYou loved the bit about custard, too,\u201d which tells me they are new to each other\u2019s data.\n\nBetween songs he tells a story about a fence with evenly spaced planks and counting himself not-lost. People laugh in the way they laugh when a sentence is both harmless and a set of directions. Toward the end he plays something that I recognise without having ever heard it; I figure this is what people mean when they say they know a person\u2019s voice. I keep my hands civilised and my face unremarkable because Gareth is here now, standing with a pint, watching in the way of a man who is measuring the size of his son\u2019s stage and finding he can live with it. When the last chord does the thing chords do where they linger like steam, there is applause even from the man at the bar who looked determined to hate everything; Kit looks at the room like he\u2019s just been offered a job he didn\u2019t apply for, then looks at me and for half a second we are in a different place entirely, one with fewer people and a cleaner floor.\n\nAfter, Janet threatens to steal the set list and I threaten to report her to the appropriate authorities. She puts her red coat on like she\u2019s putting a period at the end of a sentence and says to Malcolm, \u201cYou behaved,\u201d with affection that sounds like a reprimand because that is their dialect. Gareth claps Kit\u2019s shoulder instead of his back because he has learned that backs are fragile. Mum kisses Kit\u2019s cheeks like she is validating a parking ticket. When we walk home the pavements shine with the kind of municipal pride that comes from being rinsed with beer, and the city air tastes like a misremembered festival. In the doorway I breathe in the smell that is us now\u2014the soap we both like, the faint trace of coffee because I am inconsistent, the sharper metallic tiny ghost of guitar strings\u2014and Kit says, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this without sounding absurd but your face is a place to keep my voice when I\u2019m finished with it,\u201d and I laugh so he doesn\u2019t hear the noise my chest makes.\n\nIn the pharmacy the next day, a woman in her sixties who might have been a sprinter in a different life arrives shaking like her hands are a language, and asks in a small, vicious voice for something for her husband\u2019s chest tightness because he won\u2019t go to the doctor and because she thinks if she buys a bottle with a possible solution inside the day will understand that she is doing something. I take her into the consultation room with its tiny sink and its sternly encouraging posters and we sit in chairs that make adults into children, not because of size but because of the way silence in a small room asks for confession. I ask questions that aren\u2019t clever and she answers in a manner that suggests she believes in me enough to give me the words I need to make the right decision. We call 999 together and it is both dramatic and absolutely ordinary. When she leaves, following the paramedics in their green, she squeezes my wrist and says thank you in the way grateful people say it when they resent having to be grateful. I wash my hands as if the act can scrub fear out of skin. Janet stands in the doorway and says nothing, because she has learned the law of these moments is not to put them into a neat paragraph before they have become one.\n\nThat afternoon, a boy returns wearing the kind of jacket that thinks it is a personality. He stands at the back of the line and pretends to be texting with great intensity. When it is his turn he steps forward and says, without looking at me, \u201cSorry I was a knob last week. About the inhaler. I pretended I knew and I didn\u2019t. Can you show me again.\u201d I show him again, with the space in my voice that makes it sound like it\u2019s allowed to be new. When he gets it right he smiles at the counter like it accomplished something without him; I leave him with instructions and the kind of relief you don\u2019t get to write down.\n\nIn the evening, Kit and I make dinner that is really assembly, a collection of things that agree to be nearby. He chops onions like he is solving a puzzle. I stir like stirring is a philosophy. He tells me that his mother wants to visit and that there is part of him that goes eight years old at the thought; he does a Scottish accent so tender I want to protect his mouth from anything that will make it widen to protect himself. He says he might ring her on Sunday and I understand that I will pretend I am not listening when he does, and he understands that I will leave the room not because I mind but because privacy is a present.\n\nSunday morning arrives with light that seems more optimistic than the forecast. We clean the flat in a way that implies we are going to be audited by a friendly god. He phones his mother and paces, telling the story with omissions that are not deceitful so much as careful; I chop the tops off carrots very, very evenly because evenness feels like a blessing I can offer without being noticed. When he says, \u201cThere\u2019s someone,\u201d I hear the word come out like a coin sliding into the right slot, and when he says my name softly I go cold and then warm because their conversation is gentle and not all my business. He comes back into the kitchen with the face of a man who has found an old map in a drawer and says, \u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s never a surprise to a mother who paid attention,\u2019 and then she said, \u2018Is he kind,\u2019 and I said yes as if I could write it down in a test, and she said, \u2018Then we\u2019re all fine.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother is a good person,\u201d I say, and he smiles as if we have all just passed something we didn\u2019t know we were sitting.\n\nOn Monday, Janet returns from the concert with cheeks that neighboured flushed and a text message she refuses to show me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t embarrass himself,\u201d she says, trying on a sentence that fits better than she wants to admit. \u201cI wore the coat and I did not burst into flames. Progress for old people,\u201d she announces proudly, and then goes back to arguing with the till roll in a manner that makes the till roll reconsider its attitude.\n\nThere is a new pre-reg pharmacist assigned to us for three weeks, a tall woman named Neha who has a face that reads every label the world hands her. She stands in the dispensary with her notebook like a shield and asks good questions, like what do you write in the notes when the thing that happened was a feeling and not a number. I show her the art of eye contact with someone who is folding their prescription into a paper swan because their hands are arguing with their head. She tells me she only sleeps when she is too tired to fight sleep and I tell her I used to pretend that was a personality trait. She watches me with the methadone clients in that way of young practitioners, measuring where to put her kindness so it can\u2019t be stolen; I tell her the trick is to leave nothing lying around that you can\u2019t bear to lose and everything else inside your voice.\n\nThe following Thursday Gareth turns up at my flat with a tape measure and a bag from B&Q. He and Kit have developed a language that sits somewhere between stubborn and domestic. They spread paper on my table and draw a plan for a shelf that will fit the only wall that fits the only shelf, a sort of carpentry haiku. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got two pillows,\u201d Gareth says, all faux-casual, \u201cyou may as well have somewhere proper to put the books that keep choosing your floor,\u201d and I am grateful for the specific form his concession takes. We build in my living room with the authority of men who have decided that making is a form of apology, the good kind, the one that offers something other than a sentence. He teaches me the step between drill and screw that has eluded me for thirty years; I make tea and don\u2019t burn the biscuits; Kit holds wood in place like it\u2019s a promise that needs two pairs of hands to keep it steady while it dries. When we hang the finished thing, there is a moment where we all stand looking at it and pretend it changed the room more than it did. Maybe it did. Maybe a shelf is not just a shelf when it is also a declaration that we are learning to hold our weight with grace.\n\nWe are not immune from the ordinary ways the world trains you to be wary. On a Saturday just when the weather remembers it can be summer for ten minutes at a time, there is a shout outside the pharmacy that makes the square around my heart shrink. A man staggers in with a cut above his eyebrow that was obviously not made by negotiation, and I clean it while he confesses that pride is a bad paramedic. He smells like regret and cheap cider and he is so polite about bleeding on my floor that I forgive him before he asks. I do not ask him for his story because it would be a theft; I press the edges together and teach him how to hold himself still so the skin can decide to be on his side. When he leaves, the bell on the door does not ding because the door is already tired.\n\nThat evening Kit falls asleep on the sofa with his hand in a book as if he has reached into language and forgotten to withdraw. I lie on the rug and look at the new shelf which is still surprised to be here and think of the ways lives attach to walls. He wakes with a start that speaks of a dream he will not tell me; I have learned that dreams are rude gossip in daylight. He sits up, rubs his face, and says, \u201cDo you think you could love someone who keeps needing to leave the room,\u201d and I answer too fast, because I have been waiting for the question without admitting it.\n\n\u201cI am very good at standing in doorways,\u201d I say, to remind us both who I have already been. \u201cI will want to know which room, and why you are going, and whether you will be cold. But I am not afraid of thresholds. The only thing I ask is that you tell me which coat to have ready.\u201d\n\nHe searches my face for the caveat he suspects in every kindness and seems a little bewildered when he doesn\u2019t find it. \u201cI was afraid of asking because of the body that left first,\u201d he says, and then we are quiet because sometimes the right response is a hand being something you can sit your jaw against.\n\nIn the middle of the night I wake to the sound of rain trying to be interesting against the window. The city is a lullaby that doesn\u2019t believe in itself yet. I think about my father, who did not use doors to leave; he used time, which is a more brutal technique. I get up and go to the kitchen to drink water too quickly, the way a man does when his throat is a sudden stranger. Kit pads in, hair conducting, and leans on the counter in his boxer shorts like a still from an advertisement for survival. \u201cTell me a list,\u201d he says, without preface, because sometimes the lesson is that the body remembers a fix before you think of it. \u201cRead me something that knows how to be a line of text.\u201d\n\nI recite the contraindications for ibuprofen in the rhythm that worked on me when I was seven the night Mum left the telly on talking about wars. I do the precautions, too, and the bit about gastric irritation. He smiles against the rim of his glass like a spy with good news. \u201cYou have a beautiful cataloguing mind,\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cIt has shelves now,\u201d and he leans forward to kiss me like that is the only answer to that.\n\nWe drift into May and the city begins its annual argument with its own brightness. The Sound puts on its chrome suit when the sun performs for longer than it is paid to. The gulls become cockier and less employed. At the music shop they ask Kit if he can cover Saturdays and he says yes with the sort of optimism that assumes the calendar is a friend. He comes home smelling like wood and dust and someone else\u2019s worries left briefly in his hands. On a Wednesday we miss our walk down to the Barbican because the sky instructs us to watch television under a blanket, and we obey with all the zeal of men who have been outside enough to earn it. On a Friday a package arrives for him from Scotland that contains a scarf knitted in a cobalt that is possibly illegal; he hides his face in it like he is auditioning for a new identity and then declares himself unfit for the role because his eyes keep giving him away.\n\nWe make a silly plan to go to France on the ferry one day and not sleep because we don\u2019t deserve the soft bed of a cabin if we are not going to give the day our attention, and then we do what all couples do which is discuss snacks as if snacks are the content of love. In the pharmacy a woman brings me chocolates with a miniature thank-you card for saving her husband by ringing 999 and I say I didn\u2019t save him, the paramedics did, but I take the chocolates and I eat one with Janet in the back like we are schoolgirls, and we both make noises that would embarrass us if anyone else made them. Neha watches us with the tired disdain of youth and then later steals one and sends me an email titled Incident: lemon fondant.\n\nIn all of this, the line that was a hazard tape becomes a lane we walk. We discover the right temperature between us by accident and call it wisdom afterward. We find that we can argue about washing-up without faking a storm to make it feel like weather. We learn the flavour of silence that means I am thinking and the one that means I want you to ask. We test the edges of a kiss like a finger testing bath water. We keep not telling the world because the world does not need to be told, but we find ourselves sitting closer at Mum\u2019s and not flinching when our knees arrange themselves into evidence. Mum, for her part, posts a photograph on her private Facebook of the shelf with the caption Family are different shelves, which is her way of proving she can be subtle.\n\nOne afternoon, between prescription deliveries and the school run, a woman named Saffron, who collects her methadone with a politeness that once got her a job in a hotel lobby, doesn\u2019t come. At the end of the day she shuffles in with her apology visible as heel-worn shoes. She calls me \u201csir\u201d which she only does when she thinks she has done something punishable, and I act as if we are two people in line at a bakery waiting to decide on the same pastry. I step into the consultation room and let the door be kind. We do not talk about why she didn\u2019t; we talk about now. She drinks the dose like it is a debt being paid and then looks up at me like she might borrow something else, something I\u2019m not allowed to dispense. \u201cYou\u2019re alright,\u201d she says finally, which is the greatest compliment I receive all month, because it means that for a moment she is, too.\n\nThe day before the second gig at the pub, Kit looks up from cleaning his fretboard and says, very evenly, \u201cThe band\u2019s friend\u2014Matt\u2014called and said there\u2019s a possibility of a few dates in Bristol if we want them. Little ones. Pubs. Nothing that thinks of itself as a tour. I told him yes and also yes, and then I thought about what that means and I am on the floor of my brain making pros and cons piles from receipts.\u201d He puts the cloth down and gives me the honest face, the one that is better than handsome. \u201cDo you think you could love someone who leaves sometimes and comes back with other cities on his tongue and the kind of tired that makes him a man you do not like for an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to put someone to bed who has stepped outside of himself,\u201d I say, and taste the courage of it as it leaves my mouth. \u201cI know how to make tea like a sentence that ends in a full stop. I will miss you with an appetite that will make me clumsy. But I will also be the place where you don\u2019t have to narrate what you did to people who were not there. I won\u2019t applaud at the wrong moments. I\u2019ll just be here with the lamp and a soup that pretends to be a meal.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me with the gratitude of a man whose shoulders have been offered a chair. \u201cI will be stupid sometimes,\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cWe all are. That is the democratic promise,\u201d and then he smiles with his eyes first, which is my favourite kind.\n\nWe keep moving, careful and brave in small amounts that add up. The shelf does its work. The printer behaves. Janet wears the red coat to the supermarket and reports that two men her age looked at her with respect that did not feel like a burglary. Gareth installs a dimmer switch at Mum\u2019s and calls me because the wiring surprises him, and after he leaves she rings me to say, \u201cHe said thank you to the old house when he turned it back on,\u201d in a tone that makes me think love is a way of being pleased by the things no one else would think to applaud. On a Thursday in rain we take the long road along the Hoe and count the couples holding hands like we are anthropologists; Kit numbers the fence planks again and says the number out loud and laughs when it has not changed, as if consistency is now a joke between us.\n\nAnd on a night that leans towards summer, when the pub has less air than you\u2019d like and more hope than you expect, he plays a song I have not heard and I feel something settle in me that does not want to call itself a promise. The room is a room, and my life is a life, and there are a thousand small, interesting futures queued up like prescriptions behind a counter waiting to be counted and checked and handed over with the right words. He looks at me mid-line and the look is not a question or an answer but a place, and I go there without leaving my chair. The sea will keep doing what it does, the gulls will be wrong at dawn, the printer will choose violence on a Monday for no reason. And I will go on putting things in the right bottles and counting to the right numbers and standing in doorways for the people who need someone to watch them come back, a hand on the frame to mark the edge, a light on if they\u2019re late.Chapter 6\n\nBy the time June loosens the buttons on the sky, the morning fog changes its mind halfway through and becomes brightness without telling anyone its plan. The gulls are less indignant and more brazen, stealing soft rolls from tourists who have wandered into town believing bread can be protected by paper. The pharmacy is a degree too hot by nine and two degrees ridiculous by eleven, the little fan on the shelf performing nobility without effect; the printer, sensing it is too warm to be scolded, behaves like a child angel in a school play until I need it most. On Ebrington Street the buses pant and the bakery air is sugared and the day has the shiny film of a gloss paint that hasn\u2019t quite dried, and I move through it with my sleeves rolled and my patience intact in the shallow way you can see along with one eye closed.\n\nKit has taken to practicing with the solemnity of a man tuning a ship; he stands in the spare corner by the new shelf and coaxes in-between sounds out of strings, pulling the notes toward the thing they are becoming with a concentration you can\u2019t interrupt without feeling like a vandal. The Bristol calls he said might come have begun arriving like distant trains you can hear before you believe in them, and he answers them with the caution of a person measuring not the miles but the you that will be left for the journey back. He says they\u2019re small rooms, nights with names like Candle Factory and The Swan and a place above a Chinese takeaway that promises to be either romantic or a grease trap for noise, and when he says, \u201cIt\u2019s only three in a row,\u201d he says \u201conly\u201d the way people do when they have listened to their own heart beating faster than logic for a minute longer than is comfortable. Gareth gets out his calendar with rituals\u2014he is a man who believes in the authority of a square grid\u2014and asks for dates in the tone of a foreman who is trying not to say I will miss my worker and does not know the union representative is his own chest. At my flat we look at the bag that will be his touring bag, if three pubs make a tour, and we put in and take out items like we are building a suitcase that will contain the precise amount of hope required not to spoil.\n\nAt work the heat makes everyone\u2019s discomfort more honest and the aisles smell faintly of coconut because the seasonal endcap is full of bottles that are trying to convince the pale that they are the brown kind without going to Spain. A man with the exhausted aggression of someone at the exact intersection of hungover and under-slept leans on the counter and attempts to charm codeine out of me in the way a person tries to flirt with a lock when they have lost the key; he calls me \u201cmate\u201d and he calls me \u201cboss\u201d and then he calls me \u201csir\u201d like the word tastes interesting and none of the words are the one that persuades medicine to commit an act of mercy it is not designed for. I tell him about paracetamol and ibuprofen and cool cloths for temples and the way certain kinds of pain are asking to be witnessed not silenced, and he hates every sentence I say until he gets to the one where I tell him that his body is not punishing him for being alive; then for a second his shoulders unlearn their lesson about armour and he leaves with a bottle he does not want and a small, undeserved thank you in his throat. Neha watches this with the precise attention of a person adding a chapter to a manual that has only ever been written with graphite and smudged by too many hands; afterward she asks if there is a way to be kind without being taken, and I tell her there is only the long way, the one where you keep a list of what you are not willing to lose and measure your words against it.\n\nMum invents reasons for us to come to dinner that involve weather, which is her sneakiest tactic; \u201cIt\u2019s too hot to cook in a small kitchen; come and eat in my larger kitchen,\u201d she texts with a line of little suns and a watermelon that makes no sense and a sailor because she has found a new page of options. We say yes because we know the argument is won and because her mashed potato is a religion, and we sit at the table with ice in our glasses and our shins sticking accidentally to the chairs and talk Bristol without saying \u201capart,\u201d which is the only word you can hear if you are a coward, and I am trying not to be. Mum offers to pack sandwiches for the train the way she used to pack sandwiches for school trips, and I say we are grown and she makes a face at me that says sandwiches cannot tell the time and do not care how old you are. Gareth, brave in small increments, asks Kit if he has a spare set of strings and then adds, as if he is emerging into a light he did not expect to be warm, \u201cDo you want the car for one of them, I could drive and make a fool of myself at a service station,\u201d and Kit looks at him with that sideways gratitude that is private even when it happens in a room with company.\n\nWe go to Bristol for the first of the little dates on a Saturday that has decided to shimmer and we do not argue with the weather; the train is two carriages and a memory of other trains, and we sit on the left so the sea shows its side sooner, a little flash of light like a promise being irresponsible. Kit has brought a notebook that contains more drawings of squares than words, floor plans of rooms that do not yet exist with little Xs marked for where an amp might go and arrows indicating vantage points, and he shares them with an embarrassment that reads as pride because he is still learning that mapping is a form of bravery. Bristol is hot with itself, larger in the way a city gets when it is pleased to have people come into it for a reason that is not shopping, and the venue is exactly as he described, a room above a takeaway where the salt and vinegar have been replaced by reverb.\n\nHis bandmates are people who look like their instruments; there is Callum, lank and cheerful and a drummer when a drummer can be rustled up, and Tala, who plays bass like she is pouring concrete, firm and purposeful and interested most in buildings that stay standing. They hug Kit and then shake my hand with that calculation I know well\u2014the one where you figure out if a person is here to be permanent or to be polite\u2014and I smile in the expression I developed for mothers of babies whose rashes might be nothing or might be something more expensive. They like me fine, I think, because my job is to hold a bag and clap a sensible amount and to look at Kit like I am looking at the person on stage and not the person I am making tea for in the morning, which I do poorly. In a corner there is a man who, it turns out, used to be important to him for four months in a way so intense it bent the story, and when Kit says his name in that amicable shocked tone people use when ghosts have gotten bored with haunting and decided to shop for crisps in daylight, something sour rises in my throat and I tell it to sit down. We are all stupid with history and a room this small cannot accommodate multiple timelines without tripping over wires, so we negotiate the lanes with spare nods and jokes that know their duty and I stand on the side and watch a version of my person exist that does not require me, and I hope a form of adulthood grows more comfortable with repetition.\n\nThe show is good in the way that a thing becomes good when everyone in the room agrees to be brave for a song and then tomorrow can take care of itself. I am introduced as the friend from Plymouth with a job that makes me serious and I resist the urge to attach footnotes; it has been years since I was embarrassed by being the kind of person who knows where the plasters are, but old jokes about yourself have a way of putting on shoes quicker than you can outrun them. At the bar a woman with eyebrows like punctuation asks me how long we have been together and I say, an inch away from honesty, \u201cLong enough to know what we\u2019re like and short enough to still be surprised,\u201d and she nods like I\u2019ve either said something wise or nothing at all, which is an accurate summary of my sentences on most days.\n\nWe sleep on the floor of Callum\u2019s living room on a rug that has been shampooed more often than is healthy, under a window that refuses to remember how to close properly in summer. The night is a noise, of course, because Bristol likes to have proof that it went on doing city while you tried to rest, and we lie on our separate islands of blanket and say nothing because we are both for the moment exhausted in the way that has no poetry in it. In the morning he is a geometry of knees and elbows and there is toothpaste and then weak coffee and then a scramble back to the station, and I love him in those ugly, efficient minutes because he is a person who can make time run forward and not ask it to slow down to admire him. On the train I catalogue his neck in case of shortage later, and then I look out of the window and make a list of boats with names that would suit us if we ever turn into a thing that needs to be painted in cursive on a hull.\n\nBack in Plymouth the day bears itself as if we hadn\u2019t left, which is comforting and also the smallest joke at our expense. Saffron misses again and this time when she arrives the following day she has the look of a person who has been shouted at by a window and convinced herself there was a person on the other side; she apologises in the administrative diction she uses when being human is difficult and something official would be easier. We sit in the small room with its tiny sink and the single blue chair that never fits anyone\u2019s sense of their own height and I perform the act of telling someone the rules because the rules can hold you up if you relinquish the need for them to make sense. Neha watches as if she is building herself a future in which she is calm; later she tears one of the packets along the dotted line with a tenderness that makes me think she is ready for the part of this job that is not checklists.\n\nGareth rings on a weekday and asks if I can spare a couple of hours to help him put together a planter for Mum, which is code for I am trying to speak the language of gratitude but there is sawdust on my tongue. We measure and cut and he shows me how to look for the knot that will betray you, and I tell him about the patient who exists for me only as a pair of trembling hands and a sigh of relief, because those are the parts of my days that cannot safely be told with names. Under the pretence of discussing the correct depth for herbs, we speak of my father\u2014who is not my subject but who is a fact\u2014and Gareth says, in a tone that carries the awkwardness like a plank on his shoulder, \u201cDo you mind if I ever meet him, even a little, as the man you didn\u2019t have,\u201d and I say, after three breaths that feel like decisions, \u201cThere is no meeting him; he is an old absence. But I don\u2019t mind you building things that would have made him useful,\u201d and we both look at the planter like it\u2019s a stand-in and decide we can live with that kind of proxy.\n\nKit\u2019s mother comes down for a weekend when the sky has decided to be hospitable and brings with her a suitcase that has seen three more winters than she has and a laugh that makes you stand up straight for it. She has that Scottish kindness that slides in sideways so you can\u2019t argue with it and a salad fork in her handbag because \u201cyou can\u2019t trust other people\u2019s cutlery if there\u2019s beetroot,\u201d and Mum loves her immediately with the proprietary relief of a person whose son has brought home someone\u2019s mother who is more than a hat. She shakes my hand and then holds it for a second longer than is necessary which is enough to make me blush and also to know she is measuring my heat and my honesty, and she declares, after an hour in which she has seen us do nothing but disagree mildly about pegs, that I have a face that would have been a doctor in a small town where no one says doctor, they say call him, he\u2019ll know. She sits in my kitchen and says, to the room as much as to me, \u201cKind is not the same as soft, aye?\u201d and I say, \u201cI am getting the hang of that,\u201d and she nods with the satisfaction of a person watching a kettle click exactly when she wanted it to.\n\nThe world does not object to our little happinesses but it does not cushion them either. A boy I recognise from the Courage Kit era gets caught with a shrink-wrapped family-sized bottle of cough syrup down his trousers and two energy drinks tucked into his jacket at the exact angle that has been learned by practice, and he looks at me with the arrogance of someone who has borrowed a face for the day that can take a telling off. The security guard is theatrical and bored in alternating waves and would love to do a sprint down the street, but there are rules about drama and I invoke the one that says if you give a person a chair at the right moment they are statistically less likely to try to kick you. In the little room at the back he takes the syrup out of his waistband and looks at it with a mixture of contempt and need that makes me want to confiscate every story in his future where he believes humiliation is the price you pay for comfort, and I tell him in the language of the law about why this bottle is not an answer and in the language of my job about why it will feel like one for about an hour and a half. He is all shoulders and apology and he says \u201cman\u201d at the end of sentences until it loses its meaning, and when he leaves I am left with the shape of him, which is an ache I can label and not fill.\n\nWhen the night breaths are longer and the flat keeps its cool like a secret, we lie on our backs and do the thing human beings do where we imagine futures by naming them as if we are reporting on a person we are going to meet, not be. We do not put labels on us because our hands are very busy and because calling something a name has never once made it more true, only more administratively tidy, and anyway I have enough labels in my life that stick to plastic and tell me about expiry and dosage. When he says \u201cboyfriend\u201d he says it like he is trying to hear whether the room itself coughs politely to protest, and I do not laugh because people remember where laughter has been; I say \u201cif you say it, I won\u2019t correct you,\u201d and he says it again more quietly and finds that no one dies. We book the ferry for a date that is far enough away to be chosen and near enough to be real, and at work I tell Janet I am going to France for a night like a teenager whose permission has been grudging and am given a list of instructions that include \u201cdo not bring me back nougat unless it is the expensive kind\u201d and \u201cdo not leave him on the boat if he annoys you.\u201d\n\nOf course the electricity goes out at the pharmacy on a Tuesday at four, because that is the hour when a system knows it can ruin you with maximum efficiency and minimum time to respond. The lights die with the resigned sigh of a person who has seen worse and would prefer not to see anything at all, and the fridge alarms begin their polite screaming which is what happens when scientific instruments decide to tell you about physics as if it is your personal fault. Janet swears with the professionalism of a matador and we begin the choreography we practice exactly so we don\u2019t have to think when we are scared\u2014strip the fridge of the vaccines first, pack them into the cool boxes with the ice packs we keep like superstition, label, log the times, call the surgeries who will be impossible about it in twelve hours unless you tell them now, and push the till aside so we can get to the plugs and discover, as we always do, that power is not a moral as much as an appetite. The emergency lighting is more emergency than lighting, and Neha\u2019s face looks like a person being tested on something she didn\u2019t revise for but probably has a deep muscle memory of in her bones; we are two minutes into sweat and softly sarcastic grim determination when Kit appears in the doorway with a bag of ice because I texted him one word and he understood it required a material answer.\n\nHe does not try to be in charge because he is not an idiot and because he respects the idea of rooms where your authority is rented, not owed, but he knows how to put ice where it will make the right kind of difference and how to not ask questions until the hands have finished talking. Janet, who has never met a situation she could not narrate while fixing, says to him in passing \u201cyou are a useful coincidence,\u201d and he beams in a way that is exactly as smug as the moment deserves and then goes very calm again which is my favourite of his moods. The power returns after an hour because a man in a van with an opacity of accent made the grid remember its responsibilities, and we sit on the floor in the dispensary among the boxes with our backs against a cabinet that lives to be leaned on, and we eat the biscuits we keep for staff morale as if they are a delicacy for rescuers coming in from a storm.\n\nThere is a quality to seeing your person sit on your work floor and take instructions from the woman who trained you that is both a folding of the world and an expanse; I watch the edges of my life come into one square with an almost audible click and I am embarrassed by the swell of satisfaction it produces. We finish the incident write-up with the honesty that means we will not hate ourselves later and go home in a small, happy tired because nothing actually broke, and when he brushes his teeth he hums the electricity company\u2019s hold music under his breath because that was most of his hour and he is the kind of man who let it into him and then made it melodic accidentally.\n\nThe Bristol dates multiply the way plans do when you have proved you are a person who can do an evening without punishing a bar for inviting you to exist in it, and we begin negotiating the ordinary way couples do when work is a thing and love likes to pretend it is not booking time with your phone out. I say I can\u2019t make a Thursday because Mr. Sign-Off is doing his quarterly and the shop needs both our hands, and he says that\u2019s fine and then texts me a photograph of his set list with little notes in the margin that say \u201cremember to breathe\u201d and \u201cthis transition is a liar\u201d and my name in tiny letters by a song that is not about me except all songs are about the person you are trying to impress. He goes away and he comes back and he smells of other places and he falls onto the sofa and says \u201cI am the worst version of me for an hour\u201d and I say \u201cokay\u201d already boiling a kettle and he is indeed very quiet and steely for sixty minutes and then he is himself again and I love him for announcing the forecast.\n\nThe ferry day is an experiment in being awake for longer than is strictly healthy and believing in the romance of transport like we are teenagers again; we converse with the nap we refuse to take and sit on deck with our jackets done up to the last button as if this will persuade the wind that our relationship is sensible. In France we drink coffee that scolds us and walk along a street that thinks tartlets are the answer, and I am overcome briefly by the domesticity of buying toothpaste in a different language because it is not the kind of grand future I thought I needed to be a person; it is the one where you are in a shop and the person you kiss is at the end of the aisle with a basket and you say do we need anything else and the person says no, I think we have enough. Mum texts a photograph of the lavender and asks if French lavender is different and I tell her it is exactly the same and completely a lie, and she sends back a row of hearts that have learned to wear berets.\n\nBack at the pharmacy there is a run on hay fever tablets that suggests the entire city has decided to be allergic to itself, and I begin to be a man made of loratadine and advice about showers, and for three days the bell on the door does not stop being a dinner bell. Neha counsels a woman more gently than I would have managed five weeks ago, which is the kind of pride you don\u2019t get to put on a certificate, and Janet schedules her concert with Malcolm for a night when the weather promises not to ruin her hair entirely, which is the kind of bravery that should get medals. Gareth fits a new catch on Mum\u2019s back door which has been sulking since 1998 and Mum throws him a barbecue as compensation for the fact that he refuses financial reward when given sausages and declarations of valour.\n\nOn a Wednesday that feels like a Monday in a costume, a man I\u2019ve not seen before comes in with a prescription that looks like it has been folded and unfolded so many times it has inherited opinions. He calls me \u201cTobias\u201d from the little line on my badge no one ever notices and asks if I am old enough to remember a cabinet maker from Leeds with good jokes and a silly laugh, and I say no more slowly than I should because speed is a tell. He is not my father, because my father does not send heralds, and anyway serendipity is not a thing that happens to people who guard their doorframes like I do, but something in my back goes cold and then hot because the past has got off a bus in my postcode. He tells me a story about a workshop with dust in the air like religion and I nod in the way you nod when an anecdote is harmless and only dangerous to a very specific piece of you, and then he asks me to recommend something for the stiffness in his fingers because he has not been kind to them, and I give him the standard counsel because bodies are not required to collude with the stories we lay over them. When he leaves I stand for a second with my hand on the till as if I have to remember the method of counting, and then I go and tell Janet a joke about antihistamines because sometimes you get to decide which noise your mouth makes.\n\nThat evening, after a shift coiled with more memory than labour, we go to Mum\u2019s for a meal that is apparently salad but is in fact a thrilling parade of carbohydrates that have been lying to themselves, and Gareth gets up halfway through to fiddle with the radio because he does not like the presenter\u2019s face even on a platform that does not show faces. Kit\u2019s mother rings halfway through dessert, and he steps into the garden with the phone to his ear and that scarf looped even though it is warm because it is a talisman now, and I can hear, through the open back door, the tone of a woman who can thread any needle and the catch in her voice when he tells her about three Bristol nights that were not a shame. Mum pours me an extra splash of wine and says, \u201cWe are a picture, aren\u2019t we,\u201d which is her way of asking me if I can carry it for a minute while she sets down the bit of joy that is heavy if you hold it wrong.\n\nLater, fine-tuning the domestic act of letting someone else brush their teeth in your sink and not checking the mirror for your face behind theirs, I ask him if he would want me there for the last of the Bristol dates, the one at the little place by the river that refuses to admit it is beautiful, and he says, with that seriousness that is a relief with him, \u201cYes,\u201d and then he says, \u201cBut if you can\u2019t, I won\u2019t clean feelings with a knife,\u201d which is nonsense unless you have loved anyone while both having a job and a mother. I tell Janet in the morning that I need to leave early on Friday for a train and she says, \u201cYou will leave when the last person who needs your eyes has used them and not before,\u201d which sounds like a curse until she follows it with, \u201cI\u2019ll push the end of day,\u201d and then winks in a way that makes me think she has invented youth again for half an hour.\n\nAfter the gig by the river that uses fairy lights to make its old paint charming, we walk along a weir that sounds like it needs a better therapist and he holds my hand exactly like the sentence we have avoided admitting we can write, and a woman at a table says, \u201cYou look like the advert,\u201d and we do not ask what for. In the morning Bristol does its Sunday thing where it forgives you for being a person by presenting you with bread and a dog, and on the train home there is a child who is angrily in love with an orange and loses every argument with it in the most satisfying way. We step out into Plymouth air that smells like diesel and chips and the sound of gulls bargaining and it feels, as it always does, like stepping into a pair of old shoes that fit better than you think you deserve.\n\nWe do not keep the world out but we keep our room clean. There are new problems every week that masquerade as repeats\u2014the boy with the cough that is anger, the woman with the rash that is shame, the man with the blood pressure that is his childhood\u2014and we say the right combinations of words in the right tone and offer the right packets and swallow the wrong things that would like to come out of our mouths because the dignity of someone else\u2019s bad day is a protective cloak if you hold it out. At night we count fence planks when the wind thinks it has a better idea for us and we report back to each other with the number, still the number, and then we hold that repetition between us like the edges of a photograph. I have started to sleep with my hand under my pillow only because it makes it easier to find his in the grey morning when neither of us wants to admit we can be happy without looking suspicious; when he kisses me goodnight he sometimes murmurs a list of parts he has fixed that day and I sometimes murmur dosages in response and we both agree these are the spells at our disposal.\n\nOn a Thursday like any other and like most of them, a man in a hi-vis vest and a scraggle of a beard comes in with a letter from a cardiology clinic that looks exactly like a letter from a cardiology clinic until you see that the date is wrong by two weeks and the appointment is tomorrow and he has no idea how to get there. We draw him a map like a treasure and I write on the back of a till slip which bus and what time and where to stand, and he grazes my knuckles with his fingers when he takes the paper like he has remembered that you can be grateful and also furious about the administration of your body. He will get lost somewhere along the way because everyone does and somebody else will draw him another little map and he will tell them that the man at the chemist was kind and I will never know that I am a link in a chain that did not snap and that is the point and the grief sometimes, and then I will go back to the printer and beg it to remember its purpose.\n\nKit gets home late that night and he is tired in a new way, the one he warned me about, the one where being in a room full of bodies that ate what you gave them makes you simultaneously invincible and hollow; he puts his head in my lap and falls asleep so fast I am briefly offended on behalf of my lap for being so easy to trust. His hair smells like stages and I sit under him like a chair that has done its stretching and is ready for a night shift, and I watch the streetlight throw its careful golden net across the carpet I vacuumed properly that afternoon because some days you need an achievement without a contradictory footnote. In the morning I will make toast I cut diagonally, because we are that kind of clich\u00e9, and he will drink tea that scalds him and declare the burn his doing and not mine, and I will go to the shop and count and count and try not to forget to notice all the ordinary ways we are not losing.\n\nOn my way in I pass the charity shop and there our shirt is again, the one like my father would have worn if he had believed in shirts lasting through a week, white with tiny blue squares looking like the compromise between showing off and being invited back, and I go in this time and I buy it, because I decide that objects are allowed to be divorced from ghosts if you insist hard enough and wash them at a high temperature. Janet compliments me on my good taste exaggeratedly and then tells me to lift with my legs not my back because she is constitutionally unable to praise without adding an instruction, and I am so fond of her mad science of love that I have to go into the consultation room and sit down for a moment until it passes.\n\nBy the end of the month Plymouth has begun to smell like its summer self, a blend of tar and sugar and something green that insists it belongs, and we have a calendar less full of disasters than of groceries and trains that do, for now, arrive where they said they would. The printer chooses violence on a Monday for absolutely no reason, which is its right and ours to object to, and the gulls go on arguing their way into morning even when no one asked their opinion, and my mother announces that she has decided to grow tomatoes as if tomatoes have been waiting all this time for permission from her, and Gareth buys canes as if he trusts things to hold themselves up with the proper encouragement, which is a metaphor I am trying not to sit down in like a hot bath. We keep the light on if the other is late and we put the kettle on if the other is early and I am beginning to believe that love, or the thing we have that does not want to be argued with, is less the thunderclap and more the hand on the frame of the door, warm, available, steady, marking the edge of what is us without needing to close it.Chapter 8\n\nJuly gives up pretending to be modest and walks around with its shirt off, and then one afternoon the sky remembers it has a temper and throws down thunder like plates. The pharmacy breathes out when the heat breaks; we prop the door open with the box of leaflets about travel vaccinations and the bell on the hinge misbehaves, ringing at the wrong moments, announcing customers who are still in the street and staying quiet for the ones who have already arrived. The printer decides the storm is not its fault for once and offers me labels that fit their bottles like apologies that landed in the right mailbox, and even Janet admits, grudgingly, that the air feels like it has left a bad marriage. On Ebrington Street a traffic cone rolls down the hill like a drunk pilgrim and a boy rides past on a bicycle holding an umbrella that is fighting him as if it would rather marry the wind, and the day becomes one of those wonky British days where everyone agrees to be mildly incompetent together and no one writes anyone up for it. Mum texts a photograph of her tomatoes with the caption Tell me they\u2019re proud of themselves and I reply with three medals and a dancing lady and a carrot, because if emojis are a literacy then I have achieved a qualification I did not apply for. At home, Kit stands in the corner by the shelf we made and tunes through rain, and the sound of his guitar in wet weather is different\u2014less sparkle, more intention\u2014and I sit on the rug and watch his hands as if the note I need is hiding in the tendons.\n\nNeha\u2019s last day arrives with that odd mixture of ceremony and haste that always attends endings in places that are built to look like they are eternal. She brings in a box of doughnuts with the tragically kind optimism of a person who believes sugar will disguise goodbye, and Janet gives a speech without standing on anything, which is how you can tell she is sincere. I tell Neha the three things I am allowed to tell people who are about to become responsible for entire days without someone older to hide behind: write it down for the person you will be in a week, speak the truth if you can, and if you can\u2019t speak the truth speak slowly; pretend you are not the most important part of the room even when you are; and never, ever let the printer train you into despair. She laughs at the last one and tears up at the first two and gives me a pen that is heavier than you think it will be in your fingers, engraved with my name as if to remind me that the person I\u2019m being at the counter has a version of me that exists in rooms with no medication in them. When she leaves she hugs Janet like a niece and me like a colleague and says, softly, \u201cYou made it look like doing the job is the point,\u201d which is the nicest insult I\u2019ve ever received.\n\nThe Bristol train timetable becomes our second calendar, and the gigs accumulate the way freckles do on pale skin that has not been warned thoroughly enough about the day. There is a place called The Swan that is not a swan but is a room that knows what to do with a Friday, and an upstairs above a caf\u00e9 that insists its coffee machine must serve as backing vocal, and a courtyard show that is cancelled because the sound man declares he is allergic to rain and there is only one umbrella. Kit begins to call his bag The Bag like it is a character who is capable of passing judgments on whether you have packed enough socks to deserve success, and I write his train times on a sticky note on the fridge as if this administrative act will constitute insurance against all mischief on the rails. We learn the tone of text messages that mean exhausted and the ones that mean elated and the exact pause before a call that means a night was not a disaster but wishes to be forgiven for not being a triumph. He tells me about a man in a hat who cried during a song about a woman who never slept at the right times and I tell him about a woman who arrived with a UTI and the rage of a person who believes bodies ought to be more obedient than people, and together these stories make up a life that does not require applause to be real.\n\nThe letter arrives on a Wednesday that is only trying to be a Wednesday and fails by a degree. It is not dramatic, this letter; it is the kind of envelope that insurance companies favour, pale and impersonal, and it sits on my doormat with a humility I do not trust. The name on the back in the top left corner, tiny and old-fashioned, is my father\u2019s, which is ridiculous because men like him do not write return addresses, they leave forwarding feelings. I put it on the table and put a cup on top of it as if it might try to leave, and I make tea like a man who believes boiling water is a strategy. When I open it the paper smells faintly of his workshop from thirty years ago, sawdust and varnish and a small, accidental sweetness, as if wood shavings have a memory of being a tree that they cannot help but carry into the room. The words are ordinary as a recipe and new as pain; there is something about Leeds that is different now, a mention of a new hip that has been installed like a piece of hardware an apprentice could be proud of, and then a sentence that is both humblebrag and apology: I was in Plymouth for a job last month and stood at the top of your street and wasn\u2019t brave. He asks whether I would meet him for a tea, in the sort of caf\u00e9 where the milk is in a jug and the spoons have survived a hundred hands; he says he understands if I ignore this. He uses my full name the way you put down a tool you haven\u2019t handled in years and hope it still fits.\n\nWith the letter in my pocket I go to work and behave like a person who has not had a small bomb go off behind his ribs, and that is the skill I have been paid for my whole life. Janet watches me like she is weighing flour and when, at four, I say, as if it is a story I read about someone else, \u201cHe wrote,\u201d she does not pretend not to know who he is, and she does not say \u201cabout time,\u201d and she does not tell me which part of me ought to be generous and which part can be mean. She makes a cup of tea with a seriousness that should be reserved for diplomacy and leans her hip against the counter and says, \u201cYou are allowed to choose the weather,\u201d and then she goes and argues with a delivery driver who is trying to dump a box of sharps in the doorway and leave. At home, Kit finds me sitting at the table with the letter under the pen Neha gave me as if I am trying to sandwich a past with a present so it can be eaten without choking, and he reads my face without trespassing on the words and says, \u201cDo you want me to hate him or would you prefer I adopt him?\u201d and I laugh in a way that is too loud for the flat and then too quiet for the feeling and we agree to be clever later.\n\nOn Thursday\u2014because of course it is a Thursday\u2014I meet him. The caf\u00e9 is one where tables like to pretend they are older than they are, and the waitress has the expression of a person who is both kind by default and trained by experience to be careful with men who sit alone with paper napkins folded too neatly. He is early, which is exactly the cowardly thing to be, and he stands to greet me as if standing will make him taller than time. He is thinner around the eyes than he used to be, and his hands look like the same tools used more gently; there is a softness to him that is not softness but a reduction in edges, and he fumbles with his cup like a schoolboy who has been given responsibility for carrying soup. He tells me he has been sober for five years and looks at me like I am supposed to applaud that in public, and I shrug because the only people who are allowed to be proud in rooms like this are women who finally took their husbands\u2019 names off the bills, and he does not deserve me to be the person who celebrates him at that decibel. He talks about cabinets and contracts as if they are bridges, and then he admits, with the bravery of a thief putting a stolen watch back on a dressing table, that he would like to meet me where I am now and not where I was then. I do not promise him anything he can use to build a chair out of; I tell him that I am seeing someone whose guitar makes sense out of rooms and that my mother is a kind empire and that I count pill packets and floors with equal devotion and that I am too old to audition for his idea of me. We part like men who have both held their breath and performed the trick of breathing anyway, and in the street I stand for a moment and let the city arrange itself around the new fact of that goodbye disguised as hello.\n\nThe next week the pharmacy is loud in the afternoon in the particular manner of a place that trades in tiny solutions and larger consolations. A man comes in bleeding in the unimportant way that sometimes stands in for an emergency, a cut above his eye that looks like a punctuation mark which has decided to be dramatic; I clean it with my starting-a-prayer voice and he tells me he walked into a shelf at work and I do not ask whether the shelf was the thing he meant to collide with. A woman demands antibiotics by repeating the word as if repetition is an incantation, and I explain yet again that the potion she wants is a castle with a drawbridge, not a bottle she can shake when the door doesn\u2019t open, and eventually she buys throat lozenges and a magazine with an aggressive cover about summer. Around five, when the day is already half packed to leave, a boy we have not seen in a while arrives with Saffron leaning on him like a decision she regrets; her eyes are too shiny for this much daylight and her mouth is fighting two sets of words, and my first idiotic act is to put out my hand as if I can be a bannister she can grip while she ascends into usefulness. We make the consultation room do its modest trick of making a person smaller until they can fit their life back into their body, and she looks at the sink like it has a diploma and tells me she is fine and then that she is not and then that she is fine again, and the boy says he found her near the bins behind the Co-op and thought of me because I \u201cdo the thing where you don\u2019t make people feel stupid,\u201d which is possibly the kindest description of my job I have ever heard. We ring 999 with the casual heroism that Britain has made of phoning strangers to say a body needs help, and while we wait I sit on the vinyl chair opposite her and count my own breath like a fence plank.\n\nAfter, when the paramedics have come and gone with their green efficiency and their gentle lies about how everyone is alright when you have remembered to ask for help, I wash my hands as if I could polish away the memory of the way she said \u201csorry\u201d to the air for taking up space, and Janet stands in the doorway like a lamppost that has decided to be alive for a minute and says, without any flourishes, \u201cI know you think you did a poor imitation of God. You did your job. That is harder.\u201d At home, Kit listens with a steady face and pours tea into my cup in increments as if he knows the exact rate I can accept comfort without rejecting it on principle, and when I run out of words he does not fix anything, he sits on the floor with his back against my legs and names the plugs \u201ctwo-eyed sockets\u201d in a silly voice until I laugh against my will and then on purpose.\n\nAugust is not interested in balance; it offers feast or famine and assumes you like surprises. The Bristol rooms add a last-minute date that requires Kit to go up and down in one afternoon like a piston, and I cannot be there because Mr. Sign-Off has discovered a new way to make the quarterly report my personality problem. We text like men who are being faithful to different gods for one day and decide not to punish each other for it, and when he gets home at one in the morning he wakes me up by bumping into the laundry basket and spends a whole minute apologising to a piece of plastic for hurting it before he realises he is apologising to me, and I laugh into the pillow and pull him down into the bed by the wrist like a fisherman who has decided compassion is a technique. He sleeps diagonally and I do not resent him because when you love someone you choose the shape of your complaint very precisely, like cutting sandwiches for a child who cannot eat anything that is not a triangle.\n\nMum\u2019s tomatoes become a hubris; she invites us to a tasting as if tomatoes are wine and she is a vineyard owner with an argument with God. Gareth constructs a trellis that is more architectural than horticultural, all exact right angles and the kind of generosity you can hang hope on, and he does not say aloud that he is profoundly charmed by the way my mother can summon a harvest from a window box and impatience. We eat cherry tomatoes off a plate like sweets and declare them brave, and Kit tells my mother that a song is like a tomato plant in that it requires restraint and she decides to love him more for being ridiculous. Later, in the kitchen where the glasses know where they live, she asks me how my father was with a quiet that is not despair, and I say he was a slow apology, and she puts her hand over mine as if grounding is a science and she is a practitioner and says, \u201cYou do not have to be benevolent to be free,\u201d which is not in any of the parenting books but should be.\n\nOne afternoon a boy comes in with a nosebleed that has terrified his sister into bossiness and we manage to make it stop by humble methods\u2014pressure, patience, the right angle at which to hold a head so dignity can survive\u2014and after he leaves with a tissue moustache and a new respect for the violence of his own face, a man at the back of the queue says, \u201cThat was well done,\u201d and looks at me like praise is a currency and I am devaluing it by not agreeing to take more. I think of my father, who did work that turned his hands into maps, and of Kit, whose hands are maps of a different country, and of my own hands, which have spent the day writing labels and touching boxes and becoming objects that people trust for two minutes at a time. At six, when I shut the till with the pride of a man who has told the cash what to be, I find a small envelope in the charity box by the door with Janet\u2019s name on it; she opens it with the suspicion of someone who has lived through the kind of kindness that expects payment later, and inside is a set of tickets to a concert she mentioned in May and refused to buy for herself because she said sitting down to listen to a man sing was an admission of mortality. There is a note that says You gave my daughter her inhaler when the doctor couldn\u2019t see us and I believed in the world for an hour, and Janet pretends not to cry by reorganising the plasters.\n\nWhen Kit\u2019s mother comes down a second time the air has decided to be softer and she wears a skirt that has been to weddings and funerals and knows how to be appropriate at both. We take her to the Hoe because love involves showing someone the place where your wind comes from, and she stands with her hands on the railings and says, \u201cYou keep the edge very well,\u201d and then she corrects herself and says, \u201cNo, you keep the edge kindly,\u201d and I decide my headstone will say the same. She asks questions that are prayers with better posture, and in the kitchen of my flat she tests a cup\u2019s weight in her hand and declares my mugs acceptable for serious conversation, and that evening we talk about Scotland and lighthouses and what it is to be the mother of a son who has decided to try and stay, and she tells me about the day Kit was so quiet she thought he had been kidnapped by his own mind and then sang to his cereal, and I tell her about counting doses with my heart in my throat so often it has learned to perch there like a bird and not make a fuss. She leaves on Sunday with a scarf around her throat like a diploma and tells me I have a good voice for worrying in, which is a very Scottish blessing.\n\nBy September the evenings arrive with purpose; they step into the room instead of sneaking. The band\u2019s Bristol run pauses before autumn can pretend it has no responsibility for the way noise behaves, and in the space where gigs aren\u2019t, the music shop becomes a place where guitars confess and Kit learns the gentle bullycraft of telling men to pick the instrument that will not make them ridiculous. At the pharmacy the flu jabs arrive like a convoy and we rearrange the back room to accommodate new rituals; I make a sign in my neatest handwriting because neatness at least is a virtue you can perform when everything else is guesswork, and the first day three people faint because bodies are dramatic when they feel safe. I phone my father to tell him I am not angry at him and listen to the static that follows like the noise of a body trying to learn to be something else, and then I tell him we will not do Christmas together and he says \u201cFair\u201d in a tone that thinks it is magnanimous, and I feel nothing that could be made into a poem and I count that as progress.\n\nOn a Thursday\u2014by now the clich\u00e9 is a tradition\u2014we go back to Smeaton\u2019s Tower because the light has found a new way to be itself, slant and gold and full of mercy for people who are only trying. We climb in the way of men who remember the steps in their legs and laugh at our own breath without shame, and at the top the city offers itself again in pieces, Navy and park and ferry and the suggestion of France. We stand a little too close in that way only we can tell is not an accident, and a child announces behind us that he can see his house and his mother says he definitely cannot, and I think that is all anyone is doing when they look at a view\u2014telling themselves that the life down there belongs to them if they choose it. Kit touches the glass with the back of his knuckles like a man checking the temperature of now, and he says, without looking at me because sometimes courage happens more easily if you address the horizon, \u201cI think I want to make a thing with you that has a name,\u201d and I say, after being very mature for five seconds, \u201cWhat kind of name,\u201d and he says, \u201cThe kind that isn't a label, the sort that you call out when you come home.\u201d\n\nWe argue for three days about whether we are arguing, which is the health of us, and then on Sunday morning he stands in the doorway of the kitchen with his hair in the early stages of a plan and his face set to brave, and he says, \u201cBoyfriend,\u201d like he is giving a password to a bouncer and hopes the club is worth it, and I say, \u201cYes,\u201d and the kettle boils with the force of an agreement. We tell Mum by not telling her and letting her notice, and she says \u201cFinally\u201d like a woman who has been waiting politely at a bus stop and does not begrudge the bus its schedule, and Gareth says \u201cRight,\u201d in an approving way that does not need to be clapped, and Kit\u2019s mother sends a text with a heart that has grown little legs and is walking on the spot, which we take to mean acceptance across borders.\n\nAt work, Janet declares that calling Malcolm her man would be an unkindness to both of them and that they have agreed to be each other\u2019s person for specific events and not for Tuesday mornings, and I tell her that sounds like a peace treaty drafted by professionals and she pats my cheek and says, \u201cI knew you\u2019d understand bureaucracy as romance.\u201d The printer returns to its original sin as the weather cools, and I give it a stern telling off that makes Neha\u2014back for a day to collect a signature and a certificate and a cup of tea in her honour\u2014laugh until she almost spills sugar down her cardigan, and then we get three flu jabbers in a row whose bravery is entirely a sound they make after the needle and not before.\n\nOne evening, after a day of weather that could not commit, I find a small package on the doormat with no return address. It is a packet of guitar strings and a note in my father\u2019s careful, schoolboy printing that says Thought of him and thought of you, and I put it on the shelf under my books because not everything needs to be either forgiven or thrown away; some things can be stored until they tell you what they are for. Kit plays a song that is not about forgiveness and not about rage and not about fathers and yet somehow about all three, and I sit on the floor with my back against the new shelf while he plays and I realise that a man can be exactly himself and still be more than the sum of his stubbornness and that perhaps is the only promise we are allowed to make.\n\nWhen the first proper storm of autumn comes in off the Sound it arrives like a authority figure tired of our frivolity. The gulls go from wrong to outraged, and rain slants like criticism and the sea hammers at the breakwater as if it has heard a rumour and is not happy with it. A boy comes in to buy candles because power has gone on Mount Street and he pronounces the word as if he has never bought a candle before and would like the shop to be warned, and a woman asks if hay fever can occur in October and we all agree that bodies can do what they like when given half a chance. At closing time I turn the sign around with a feeling that is less relief and more gratitude for having survived another day without dropping anything that cannot bounce, and when I step outside the wind rearranges my hair into a style I cannot defend and Kit is there under the awning in a coat that makes him look like he takes weather personally and he says, \u201cI counted them,\u201d and I say, \u201cFence planks,\u201d and he nods with an idiotic seriousness that I adore and we walk home into an evening that has just enough light left to pretend there are no consequences.\n\nWe move through the rooms like men who have decided to be deliberate, and we put the kettle on like a plan, and I take the shirt I bought from the charity shop out of the wardrobe and iron it because I have decided it is mine and because wearing it will be more useful than keeping it as an artefact of courage. We do not name the future because the future does not care about our labels, but we begin speaking to it in second person as if it might be listening. If love is a thing in this chapter it is the act of letting a person know where the pans are without performing a little drama, and remembering to take your keys when you leave so the person who loves you does not have to get up, and standing in the doorway with one hand on the frame while someone you care about checks the weather outside and then turns back in, and neither of you pretends the edge is anything but what makes the room.Chapter 10\n\nBy October the morning light remembers how to go grey first and then make up its mind, and the city acquires that polite chill that changes the way people stand while they wait for a bus. The gulls are still wrong, but their arguments carry less bravado and more complaint. The pharmacy smells like cardboard and hand gel and a faint citrus that is not a fruit so much as the idea of one; we have cleared a corner to make room for the flu clinic operation as if we are preparing to launch small boats. I print consent forms until the printer, scandalised at my competence, jams in solidarity with winter. Janet unfurls her sleeves, ties her hair back with a rubber band she swears is new, and says, \u201cWe will put needles into arms with compassion and speed, like two nurses who got lost in the wrong play,\u201d and we do, because theatre has nothing on the choreography of two people who have worked together long enough to recognise the noises each other\u2019s shoes make.\n\nKit has a new sound when he practices, a stitch between notes that wasn\u2019t there before, a steadiness that does not so much announce itself as simply be. He stands by the shelf as if the shelf is a collaborator, and coaxes songs out of a Tuesday evening that behaved in the way of Tuesdays everywhere, which is to say obediently until five and then in revolt until bed. The Bristol rooms have paused while people forget they enjoy leaving their houses, and the music shop has become a place where he learns the geography of men who want a guitar because a poster told them they could be a better shape in a mirror. He comes home smelling like new strings and cardboard and dust that deserved better marketing, and when I ask how his day was he tells me stories that could be filed under anthropology: the way people cradle instruments as if they are babies they have invented for themselves; the way some men need permission not to be loud. We cook ordinary food with the satisfaction of men who have done their work and are now permitted to eat, and he sets the table as if the knife belongs to the right of the plate because the right of the plate is where knives live when they get to pick.\n\nBonfire Night becomes a series of small bangs pretending to be opinions. We take Mum to the Hoe because she cannot be told that fireworks look better from television; she is a woman who continues to trust that carrots weep when you peel them if the day is sentimental, she cannot be persuaded that explosions have an order to keep. Gareth brings a thermos of hot chocolate so potent it might strip varnish, and a bag of marshmallows he swears he bought for someone else. The crowd behaves in the city way\u2014strangers agreeing to be near each other and not making a fuss. When the first volley goes up, a toddler near us takes offence on principle; her mother negotiates with the sky as if the clouds might tone it down. Kit stands with his hands in his coat pockets and watches the streaks of colour draw lines against the dark; he leans into me by a degree only we would measure. \u201cIt feels like being inside a drum,\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cWe can leave if you want,\u201d which is the kindest offer I know how to make. He shakes his head and smiles with that small, private bravery, and when a particularly enthusiastic bundle goes off he flinches and then laughs at himself immediately, and I wish for a minute that the human body could be reissued with a better startle reflex and then decide I like this one; it keeps us honest, the way weather does.\n\nMy father sends a postcard from Whitby that features a harbour and a gull pretending to be wholesome. The handwriting is smaller than mine, careful in a way that makes you persnickety about your own breath. He writes that he thought of Plymouth when the wind pushed him toward the edge and that his new hip is \u201csettling in like a lodger,\u201d and I look at the card like it has asked me to rate his metaphors and find them acceptable. I slide it under the bowl we keep keys in, which feels like hiding and also like arranging. I tell Kit because secrets taught to me by boys do not belong here, and he listens with that stillness that makes the air organise itself, and he says, \u201cIf we meet him again, I will wear my kind face,\u201d and I laugh and say, \u201cIt\u2019s the only one you brought,\u201d and we both enjoy being men who can afford a joke in the vicinity of something serious without spoiling it.\n\nIn the pharmacy the flu clinic ushers in fainting as an amateur sport. Two teenage boys attempt to out-brave each other to the point that both end up on the floor, performed with the disgust of people who have been betrayed by circulation; Janet resurrects them with water and a tone that would make a general square his shoulders. A woman with three grandchildren admires our efficiency and then begins to cry because nobody told her how good it would feel to have done this thing, and I pretend to wipe down the chair for an extra second so she can borrow my silence without eye contact. The methadone clients fold themselves into the back room with the weary elegance of people who have learned to survive bureaucracy, and Saffron arrives on time twice, late once, and then one day early by accident; she looks at the calendar like a traitor and says, \u201cI can be wrong and still be alright,\u201d which sounds like a line from a play I would pay to see. I give her her dose and the glass of water and she sits for a minute because the chair is a chair and world history has not made enough of chairs that let bodies remember they belong.\n\nJanet discovers the Exeter museum has a lacquered cabinet the exact age of Malcolm and insists on visiting it as research; she returns with a brochure and an opinion about a man in the gift shop that could make a stand-up comedian redundant for a week. She speaks about Malcolm in the language of logistics and delight and refuses to call him anything a novelist would like. \u201cHe is a specific companionship,\u201d she says, at the end of a long day when we have both spoken politely to five people who did not deserve politeness and are proud of ourselves anyway. \u201cIf I start calling him names that require a haircut, I will have to be a woman who can be unhappy on a schedule.\u201d I tell her the world has enough scheduled unhappiness and she says, \u201cExactly,\u201d and buys herself a lilac nail varnish from the aisle with the firm air of a woman who is no longer asking permission from her own hands.\n\nMid-month, Mum overdoes life by an inch and tips herself into a faint like she is illustrating a point in a nineteenth-century novel. She\u2019s in her kitchen, of course, because the kitchen is where she assembles family out of vegetables whether they like it or not; Gareth calls me with a voice that has had its volume knob turned to \u201csteady\u201d by will. I arrive before the kettle finishes disapproving of someone using it in a crisis, and Mum is on the floor with a tea towel behind her head and an embarrassed smile trying to win an argument with pallor. We do all the ordinary extraordinary things\u2014glucose, a small scolding about breakfast, pulse and pupils and the good sense to sit still when you want to demonstrate that nothing ever happens to you. A&E at eleven in the morning is a parade of stubborn fragility, and we queue with dignity and a sandwich I bully her into eating and a joke she keeps forgetting the punchline to. The tests say this is a body under-charmed by salt and overconfident about standing, and she is released back to us with instructions about water and caution delivered in the tone you use for people you want to frighten into taking care. Gareth, who has been convincing furniture to forgive him for his posture for two hours, cries in the car in the exact manner of a man who refuses to be dramatic and loses, and I put my hand on his shoulder and press once like a doorbell. We get Mum home and settle her on the sofa and she announces she is bored and I could not be more delighted by her boredom if it had sprouted medals. For the next week she eats with the determination of a woman training for a marathon in a sport called staying, and Gareth brings her soups with names that are him trying to be clever and her deciding to let him.\n\nThat evening I ring my father from the low chair beside the new shelf and he answers like people answer when they have been waiting and are pretending not to. I tell him in plain words about Mum and about hospitals and about tea towels, and he does not ask if he can visit because he is not a fool and because the decade between us looms like architecture. He says he is sorry and means it, which is a revolution too late to parade, and he says he will not intrude, and I say, because the adult in me is tired and the child in me is a small man with a tiny hammer, \u201cYou can meet me again, by the sea, when you like,\u201d and he says he will try. I tell Kit I have reopened a door and he does not ask if I am certain of the weather; he trusts me to know which coat to bring. We go to the Hoe and look at the water like it has kept secrets for us, which it has.\n\nRain on glass becomes more interesting in November, which is not something you can prove but is true. We manage three walks in a week that feel like reasons and one walk that feels like punishment, and on the punishing one Kit counts fence planks aloud just to prove that certainty continues to be an option. He says, with frost in his breath like a thought escaping, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m scared of leaving anymore. I think I\u2019m scared of coming back and finding I haven\u2019t been missed,\u201d and I say, \u201cMy house does not know how to forget your shoes,\u201d and he nods as if I have given him a glue stronger than words. The band record in a practice room that smells like student and ambition and everybody\u2019s shampoo, and he brings home a flash drive like a lozenge that might cure regret. We listen on the sofa with our knees nearly touching and he does the thing where he pretends not to watch my face and fails; the songs have become rooms and he has taught them how to let people in and out, and I am proud in the quiet way that makes your chest become a terrace.\n\nAt the pharmacy there is a run on cough syrup that would make a person cynical if one were not already trained in the art of sighing correctly. A man attempts to purchase the entire shelf with the apology face of a person who has been assured by a friend called Darren that it takes two bottles to achieve a kind of lucid transcendence; I sell him none of it and three boxes of tissues and an adult conversation about all the things cough syrup is not supposed to do. A woman arrives with a bag full of supplements and the hopeful aggression of someone who discovered the internet and believes it owes her a degree; I talk her down from the edge of evening primrose oil by invoking the magic spell of placebo in a tone that respects it. Janet develops a cough that sounds like a dog at a gate and refuses to go home because she is the kind of woman who would deliver a baby at the till rather than disrupt the teamwork; I remind her that martyrdom is an unattractive hair accessory and send her to sit down with a decoction of lemon and bossing. She texts me from the staff room a photograph of her red coat draped over a chair and the caption \u201con strike\u201d and I almost drop a box of loratadine laughing.\n\nDecember arrives with the soft boots of a man who knows he\u2019s late and hopes his charm will carry him. The lights go up on the Barbican\u2014the kind of small, honest lights that make you believe in people who climb ladders thoughtfully\u2014and we go down to look at them as if fairy lights were evidence for something. We decide to do Christmas uneventfully on purpose; Mum refuses to hear \u201csmall\u201d as anything other than a challenge and begins cooking lists in a notebook she keeps by the kettle. Gareth buys too much foil and a meat thermometer that behaves like a person with a public persona, and Kit brings home a tiny rosemary bush that smells like a spell. At my flat we buy a string of lights that agrees to behave like stars if asked nicely, and he wraps them around the shelf and casts the new books in generous light as if he is staging them for a photograph neither of us has the energy to take. We keep the gifts modest because we are trying to outgrow the childhood instinct to equate surprise with love, and on the morning itself he hands me a small box that contains a label maker with a face so serious I laugh out loud; he says, \u201cI will never be allowed to mock you for labelling the sugar again,\u201d and I give him a set of screwdrivers for tiny screws and a packet of picks in three tones of blue and the privilege of laughing at himself when he attempts to assemble the stand for his amp and undone it twice. Mum gives me a jumper that believes in my shoulders and I wear it with the gratitude of a man who has had his shape affirmed; Gareth grills brussels sprouts like he is entering a competition and they survive.\n\nMy father sends a card with a lighthouse on it that is not ours but is trying, and inside he writes, \u201cI am proud of you in the way a man can be when he has not earned a chair,\u201d and I do not cry because the onion I cut for the gravy already made me do that yesterday. I put the card on the shelf and when Kit sees it he touches my hand the way you press a paper flat when you are about to write something important on it. Later, after the plates have been cleared and the radio has been turned down to the level that demands intimacy, Mum tells a story about me at five making a potion out of glitter and washing-up liquid that turned the entire sink into a bubble sculpture, and I blush at the old embarrassment like it is a friendly ghost. We go home under a sky that has chosen to be a proper dark, and Kit steals me under the fairy lights and kisses me with the patience of someone who can see the edge and intends to stand there with both feet and still be relaxed, and I think, not for the first time, that the body can be taught better manners by other people\u2019s gentleness.\n\nBetween Christmas and New Year, the pharmacy becomes a haven for the hungover and the resolute. Men arrive with diets in their eyes and women arrive with gym suggestions in their hands and I sell them vitamins because it makes us all feel purposeful and will not make anything worse. A boy I recognise from spring comes in to thank me for not selling him something he wanted then; he has a new jacket and the kind of eyes that have been told the truth recently and didn\u2019t like it and made peace anyway. He buys plasters to go with his new shoes and flirts with the scanner like it is going to make him into a barcode that signifies a better price, and I let him because sometimes the job is to be the adult who doesn\u2019t pop somebody\u2019s balloon.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve we do not go to a party because the people we used to be are men who feel guilty in kitchens they can\u2019t clean. We go to the Hoe because the wind wants company and stand by the fence with the planks and count them because we are committed to the bit, and at midnight a handful of fireworks admit themselves over the water and the ferry to France blows its horn like a man with a romantic problem, and Kit kisses the corner of my mouth as if he has learned cartography and is checking the legend. We go home and nearly fall asleep while the kettle boils because this is adulthood and we are so good at it we have become boring, and I have never been more pleased to be dull in my life. In bed, the window rattles in its frame because the glass would like to be a song and is not, and we lie on our backs and list the unbeautiful goals we have for the year\u2014fix the dripping tap, get the chair leg looked at, soften around the parts of ourselves that are cruel to us\u2014and fall asleep mid-sentence because we are not men who complete all the things we start, which makes us exactly like everyone else.\n\nJanuary is a government form. It asks you to declare things you would prefer not to; it requires dates and tolerances and a promise to be on time. The pharmacy settles into that stubborn rhythm where the rain measures out the day by insisting on being renamed. We begin the dance of stock and need that feels like writing a novel in bottles without a plot. A man brings in a New Year\u2019s resolution disguised as an asthma review and we discover he has been using his inhaler like a perfume; I teach him how to hold something that has a responsibility for him, and he leaves with a grin that tells me he has understood that breathing on purpose might be a revelation disguised as boredom. The printer behaves for nine consecutive days and I begin to suspect it has fallen in love with me; I refuse to engage because I know how this ends. Janet announces she is considering a weekend course in pottery and Malcolm, who has eaten enough cottage pie in her company to have opinions, says he will not come if they make him use a wheel, which is a sentence I did not foresee being relevant to my life.\n\nKit is offered a small managerial role at the shop\u2014three days a week organising the world so other people can think they are creative without being interrupted by the need to find a cable. He accepts with the gravity of a man committing to keep receipts for emotions, and we celebrate with a cake bought from a baker who uses the knife like a conductor. He stands in the kitchen with the cake fork and says, \u201cI used to think being in charge was the same as being guilty,\u201d and I say, \u201cIt can be if you are a man, but it is also the business of being spared worse men,\u201d and he nods as if his hands have just learned something and will tell his mouth later. The band asks whether he can record an EP in a friend\u2019s studio that is really a garage with better acoustics, and he says yes in the tone of someone who is prepared to fail in public; we buy him a notebook that will become religion and he fills the first page with rectangles and the names of songs that are not yet sure of themselves.\n\nMy father manages his promise in February with the caution of a man moving furniture around in a room where he is a guest. He asks if we can meet at the snack van that pretends to be a caf\u00e9 near the ferry because he has decided the sea can vouch for both of us. We stand with our paper cups and talk about nothing and then about wood; I ask him if he remembers a cabinet he made where the drawer stuck because he loved the wood too much to sand it and he laughs like a door refusing to open and says, \u201cI learnt,\u201d and I say, \u201cMe too.\u201d He brings a photograph of me at two that I do not own, me in dungarees that suggest a child who would like to borrow a hammer, and he places it in my hand as if returning a library book and we both stand there like men who have felt their ages queue up behind them in neat rows and are acting as door staff. I do not tell him about the first time I fell in love because that is not his to hold; I tell him that I count fence planks in the wind and it sounds ridiculous and feels correct, and he nods as if he would like to be able to do a ridiculous thing and not be observed doing it. We agree to be men who can say hello without interrogating the definition, and on the walk home I count streetlights just to make a mockery of consistency.\n\nLate winter ruins someone\u2019s toe on the wet tiles in the pharmacy and I learn again the specific way a body throws a complaint into the world with noise and blood and a degraded dignity that has to be returned with interest by someone else. I use my consultation voice and the plasters that never stick and the call to 111 that is a ritual if you do it in the exact order; after the ambulance has come, the rest of the day shrinks as it always does and refuses to carry its own weight and I am full of a rage that is useless and noble and knows better. Janet says, \u201cDon\u2019t take it home,\u201d but she says it with a fondness that makes me want to the way a teenager wants to do exactly the wrong thing when told not to. I don\u2019t, though. I go home and tell Kit a version of the story that is good for dinner, and when I run out of civility I put my head on his knee as if sleep is a commodity he might loan me at a reasonable rate, and he plays a chord that feels like a hand on the frame.\n\nWhen spring tries its first trick we are ready to be fooled. Mum\u2019s tomatoes have become an anecdote; she reads seed packets like they contain prophecies and Gareth pretends to disagree with the instructions purely to be given new ones. The city smells like it forgives you if you apologise properly, and the light comes back as if it never left and expects a medal. On a Thursday we go to Smeaton\u2019s Tower again and the view, which has done nothing to earn our gratitude except exist, earns it. Kit puts his palms on the glass and counts the smudges someone forgot to wipe last week as if someone else\u2019s fingerprints indicate our right to be here. He says, \u201cI want to call you something soft when we\u2019re tired and rude when we\u2019re late and honest when we are stuck, and I think boyfriend does most of the job but it feels like a jumper you stop noticing except when it\u2019s missing,\u201d and I say, \u201cThen keep it warm, and if it frays we\u2019ll learn to darn,\u201d and he laughs and later calls me sweet man with such lack of irony I have to sit down.\n\nWe begin making plans that do not apologise for themselves. A trip to Leeds to look at a workshop that is no longer my father\u2019s but maybe is a geography I am entitled to walk around in; a weekend on Dartmoor where the wind is not a metaphor but a person you have to negotiate with; the idea of a song that belongs to this room and nowhere else. We buy a plant that does not insist on being dramatic and put it on the shelf in the corner where light arrives as if dizzy, and we water it like a pact and call it a name and do not tell anyone because plants do not want to be on our social media.\n\nWork finds its monastic humility again, the counting, the checks, the rightness of aligned labels. A teenage girl learns to inject herself for the first time and swears with the elegance of a poet, and I admire her for cussing at fear and continuing. Saffron arrives one morning with a new coat that does not earn its beauty; she stands straighter than last month and tells me a joke so bad it requires a police escort, and I laugh and she says, \u201cI made it up so you would have to be kind,\u201d and we are allies for the length of a minute and then the day takes her somewhere else to be herself. Janet\u2019s pottery produces an object that knows what it is despite being beheaded three times; she brings it in and puts paper clips in it and calls it a success, and I print a tiny label for it that says JANET\u2019S GLORY BOWL and she shouts at me while smiling with her teeth.\n\nThe EP is recorded with the kind of concentration that robs you gently. Kit comes home smelling like effort and string polish and he collapses into domesticity the way some men collapse into armchairs; he eats toast like a profession and listens back with that honesty I admire and dread, the honesty that could possibly lead him away and might also lead him further in. One evening he plays me a track and afterwards he does not speak and I do not speak and a silence opens up that is not a warning, just a room; eventually he says, \u201cI think I made something I won\u2019t hate later,\u201d and I say, \u201cThat is the highest art,\u201d and he laughs and breaks the spell.\n\nAt the end of the month my father sends an email because he has learned the keyboard and is proud. He writes that he has been to a meeting where men appeared and talked about doing better without any women in the room, and asks me what the word \u201cperformative\u201d really means, and I send him three sentences that manage not to bite and include the word \u201cshelf\u201d as a metaphor and he writes back, \u201cRight,\u201d and then, \u201cI will build a better one.\u201d I show Kit and he kisses me on the temple as if that part of my head is a page and he has approved the edit. We get on with our evening and the printer gets on with its long-term project of teaching me humility and the kettle clicks and the shelf holds and the city breathes and the wind continues to be its very gem-like wrong, and I stand in the doorway between the kitchen and the sitting room with a hand on the frame and practice the art of marking the edge without needing to close it.",

Coffee in a paper cup, elastic gloves snapping, the steady rhythm of the printer spitting labels like a mild insult. In Plymouth the gulls wake earlier than most of us, shunting their voices into the gaps of morning. By the time I turn the lights on at the pharmacy on Ebrington Street, the gulls have already held a full debate.\n\n\u201cMorning, Toby,\u201d says Janet, sliding through the back door with her tote bag packed like she\u2019s moving house. She\u2019s been here twenty-two years and knows everyone\u2019s antihistamines and anxieties by heart. She lays out her collection of herbal tea sachets and peers at the rain. \u201cWet again.\u201d\n\n\u201cTruly groundbreaking,\u201d I say. The first patient presses her face against the door before I\u2019ve unfastened the lock. It\u2019s that kind of day, all days.\n\nWe are a small outfit with an outsized stream of prescriptions. Pregabalin, warfarin, antibiotics like the words to a song. The methadone clients start trickling in, quiet, purposeful, the men with faces like closed doors, the women who talk too much about everything except the thing they\u2019re here for. I measure, I observe, I tick, I sign. When I speak I try to pitch my voice somewhere warm. Pharmacists are the middle shore between panic and plan. We translate doctors\u2019 handwriting and people\u2019s fears into simple instructions: Take one at night, with water. Keep taking even if you feel better. Do not mix with alcohol. The list of \u201cdo nots\u201d is a kind of prayer.\n\nAt ten thirty, Mum texts: Dinner at mine tonight? Bringing a guest. Smiley face, aubergine, which is Mum for \u201cI\u2019m being cheeky but I know you won\u2019t call me out on it.\u201d\n\nI type: I finish at six. OK.\n\nShe replies with a string of fireworks, possibly left over from Guy Fawkes. Mum is fifty-eight and lives on emojis; they are how she can send me love without using the word. She raised me with the prickly tenderness of a woman who married too young, divorced too late, moved cities just when I had made a friend. I always go when she asks. It\u2019s one of the few rules I\u2019ve never had to write down.\n\nBy midday the sun remembers itself. There\u2019s a man with a bag full of vitamins who wants to know if iron makes you mean. There\u2019s a boy with a bruise on his cheek buying plasters and chewing gum. There\u2019s a tourist couple arguing over ibuprofen strengths as if the wrong choice will break them. Janet taps the counter with a pen while the computer freezes, and says, out of nowhere, \u201cYou were a quiet one as a boy, weren\u2019t you? Did you have an imaginary friend?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had an imaginary me,\u201d I say, printing a label the size of a Victorian novella. \u201cHe was very chatty and always right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019d he go?\u201d She unpeels a blister pack with the care of laying out rosary beads.\n\n\u201cPlymouth. He got a job.\u201d\n\nI unlock the controlled drugs cabinet for the third time in an hour and catch my reflection in the door, stretched and warped by the glass and the angle. I look like someone raised underwater. People tell me my eyes are kind, which is like telling a chair it\u2019s sturdy. You can sit on kindness. It\u2019s useful. But no one falls in love with a chair.\n\nAfter lunch I ring a GP to correct a dosage. I counsel a man about inhalers, again. I watch a seagull sidestep across the pavement like it\u2019s crossing a tightrope. The telephone rings with its static squeal; a woman has lost her repeat prescription slip and needs \u201cit all again\u201d. I print out creams, pills, tablets, drops. If there\u2019s a rhythm to pharmacy, it is not the heartbeat, but the waves: incoming, outgoing, relentless, a tide of small emergencies.\n\nAt five I realize it is Thursday. Mum\u2019s new partner of nine months\u2014Gareth\u2014has a habit of saving his announcements for Thursdays. He arrived as a punctual smile in June and then settled, like a shelf bracket you don\u2019t notice until it\u2019s holding up all your plates. He\u2019s from Cornwall \u201cbut not really\u201d, tall, tidy hair, a man who irons T-shirts. He says he\u2019s a carpenter, which I suppose is why he always seems to be measuring the room with his eyes. He and Mum dance in the kitchen at random intervals to the radio, and when I walk in on them, he blushes like a schoolboy and Mum keeps swaying as if I\u2019m the one interrupting a waltz halfway.\n\nBy six I\u2019m locking the till and wiping down the counter with bleached determination. Janet leaves with her tote bag full of herbal tranquilizers and a pack of cheddar I bought from next door. She touches my arm. \u201cBe kind to yourself, love.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there an alternative?\u201d I say, and she laughs in that way that is half a cough.\n\nI step out into a sky that looks hand-washed. The air smells like bread from the bakery and diesel from the buses. My flat is on a thin street near the Hoe, one of those terraces that still have the original tiles by the doorway if you look closely enough. I change my shirt, splash water on my face, notice a new constellation of headache forming above my left eye, and leave for Mum\u2019s before the ache can settle.\n\nMum lives in a white-fronted semi near Mutley Plain, a garden that she has bullied into being mostly lavender and stones. The porch is an installation of umbrellas and shoes. Gareth answers the door, cheeks pink, tie loosened like the end of a sentence.\n\n\u201cThere he is! The chemist,\u201d he says. He\u2019s always over-excited to see me, and I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s genuine or an attempt.\n\n\u201cPharmacist,\u201d I say, because I cannot help it.\n\n\u201cRight, right. Come in. We\u2019ve got one of your favorites.\u201d He beckons me with the reverence of a gameshow host. Gareth\u2019s favorites for me include mashed potatoes, jazz that doesn\u2019t shout, and cider that tastes like apples instead of sugar.\n\nMum comes out of the kitchen with a tea towel over her shoulder and flour dusted on her nose like a cartoon cook. \u201cDarling! You\u2019re here. Kiss.\u201d\n\nI kiss her cheek. \u201cYou look like a snow globe.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect. Gareth, don\u2019t stand there like a lamppost. Go and fetch him a drink. He worked all day. All those poor people who think oats can cure gout.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot oats,\u201d I say, letting myself be folded into the house. \u201cWhole wheat.\u201d\n\nThe radio says something about tides and ferries to France. The table is set with mismatched plates because Mum refuses to buy new ones until the old ones \u201cfinish their journey\u201d. A vase of tulips leans all in one direction. I hear a voice from the hall, a male voice not Gareth\u2019s\u2014lower, slower\u2014say, \u201cDo I take my shoes off?\u201d\n\nMum\u2019s mouth squares at the corners. Her eyes flick to me and away. \u201cAh,\u201d she says. \u201cThe guest.\u201d\n\nGareth returns with two ciders and a glass of water, and a third voice stands behind him like a second doorway. He steps aside, and I see the guest.\n\nThis is what I notice: He is tall but not intimidatingly so; he has black hair cut short on the sides and left longer on top, like it grew wild then learned manners; his T-shirt is soft and looks older than he is; his eyes have the sort of color that makes the phrase \u201cstormy\u201d feel cheap. He\u2019s holding his shoes in his hand, uncertain what to do with them. He looks like he got lost in his own house. He smiles, and he has the kind of smile that is both a question and an answer.\n\n\u201cToby,\u201d Mum says, unnecessarily, as if she needs to remind herself who I am. \u201cThis is Kit.\u201d\n\nKit lifts a hand, wobbles it in a half wave, then decides to put it down again. \u201cHi,\u201d he says. \u201cI am... I\u2019m Kit.\u201d\n\n\u201cChristopher,\u201d Mum says, beaming at him as if he has just recited something memorized. \u201cI keep telling him it\u2019s a good name. Just like your granddad. But he says that\u2019s not who he is. He\u2019s Kit.\u201d She looks back at me. \u201cThis is Toby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said that,\u201d Gareth says, and then claps his hands together. \u201cAnyway! Dinner. Fish pie. And peas because I am traditional.\u201d\n\nKit isn\u2019t mean about the introduction like some people might be\u2014no roll of the eyes, no defensive shrug. He has a stillness that I envy. When he shakes my hand, his palm is cooler than mine. I wish I could catalog the smell of him in pharmaceutical terms: notes of soap and something more complicated. I hate the part of me that notices these things.\n\nMum goes to the kitchen, and I follow with plates because it is the task that keeps you moving without thinking. I whisper, \u201cWho is he?\u201d over the sound of the oven door opening.\n\nMum puts a mitt to her forehead like she\u2019s playing make-believe. \u201cWell. You know Gareth has a son.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, summoning the memory of some probationary conversations about the shape of families. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t see him much.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t. Now he is. Seeing him. More.\u201d Mum\u2019s eyes shift to the kitchen doorway and back. \u201cKit is\u2026 he\u2019s twenty-six, darling. He lives in Bristol. But he\u2019s here for a bit. He\u2019s going to stay with us. Just while he gets a few things sorted.\u201d\n\nThis is the part where the new information becomes a ceiling I\u2019ve just walked into. \u201cStay. In the spare room.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the airing cupboard,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat\u2019s that face?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t make a face.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou made the face.\u201d\n\nGareth comes in with his standard bluster. \u201cEveryone ready? Good. Toby, bring the spoons. You love a spoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like accuracy,\u201d I say.\n\nIn the dining room Kit is standing like a polite piece of furniture. He\u2019s looking at the framed photographs on the wall: Mum and me on the Hoe in raincoats; Gareth pretending to be shocked by the size of a Christmas turkey; my grandfather in uniform, unsmiling, the past compressed into a grainy rectangle. There is a space on the wall where the sunlight fades the paint a shade; a picture is missing. I try not to take inventory of absences.\n\nWe sit. I take my usual place; Mum takes hers; Gareth sits at the head like he believes in lines of command; and Kit sits in the chair that my last girlfriend used to sit in when she came to dinner, one foot folded under the other knee, as if the furniture and he are negotiating terms.\n\n\u201cSo, Bristol,\u201d I say, because my brain chooses the weather of conversation. \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\nHe pushes a piece of fish to one side of his plate, methodically like a scientist. \u201cBit of everything. Mostly small gigs with my band. Sound stuff. I help out at a print shop when we\u2019re not playing. I fix things that make noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very good,\u201d Gareth says, a bit too quickly. Pride is a sharp flavor in the air.\n\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Kit says to me. \u201cChem\u2014sorry. Pharmacist. They told me. Clearly I wasn\u2019t listening with my eyes open. Do you like it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt keeps people from falling apart,\u201d I say. \u201cSome days I\u2019m a translator. Some days I\u2019m a detective for poor handwriting. Sometimes I feel useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you feel like a vending machine,\u201d Mum puts in, and kisses the air toward me. \u201cHe\u2019s very good with people. Always has been. Even when he was small and pretended not to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had an imaginary me,\u201d I say, because I\u2019m apparently in the business of repeating my own bland jokes.\n\nKit laughs, and he has a nice laugh. Not cleansed, not performative. It\u2019s the laugh of someone who doesn\u2019t share jokes to win. He looks at my hands, which are still and clean on the table, and says, \u201cDo you play anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cPills. And on alternate Thursdays, the spoons.\u201d\n\nHe smiles wider, and the conversation splinters into agreeable pieces: Plymouth venues, whether fish pie is better with egg or without (I lobby against egg; I always lose), the quality of silence in different rooms, what the light does on the Sound on a winter morning. He talks about music with a care that makes me think he could fix a song with a needle and thread. He has opinions about ceilings. He asks me questions like there will be a test later, but in a way that makes the test seem fair.\n\nWe finish with apple crumble that is more butter than fruit. Gareth takes plates away in pairs, and the radio plays something old and soft. Mum leans her head on her hand and watches me watching Kit and even that observation feels like a small betrayal. I\u2019m a pharmacist: I know how to label a chemical reaction when I see one. There it is: a little heat, a little change of color; the dissolving of resistance.\n\nAfter we eat, Gareth insists on day-old coffee and a tiny glass of port he saves for \u201cbirthdays and Thursdays\u201d. Kit and I drift to the living room because the chairs there are better at admitting tired men. The spare room door is ajar. A stack of cardboard boxes sits underneath the window, some marked with black marker. Kit picks up the top one, the way you might pick up a newborn, and remembers it is heavy, and sets it down again.\n\n\u201cYou moving in with an orchestra?\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cBooks,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd wires that I\u2019m not sure did anything in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the feeling,\u201d I say.\n\nHe looks at the spines peeking through the cardboard like they\u2019re gossiping. \u201cI figured I should leave Bristol before Bristol left me. My friend Callum said that sounded like something someone in a film would say when they were pretending to be brave.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I hear the question leave my mouth like it\u2019s looking for a coat to put on. I don\u2019t really know him. I shouldn\u2019t be prying. But also I want to hear his voice do something other than polite.\n\nHe shrugs, but it\u2019s not defensive. \u201cI kept building things that fell down. Kept choosing the same people. It got embarrassing. New place, new mistakes, you know? Dad said\u2026 he said there\u2019s room here. He said you,\u201d he gestures, vaguely, into the air between us, where a picture might hang, \u201cwere a good person.\u201d\n\nI am not quick enough to refuse the compliment. \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cHigh expectations make people petty,\u201d I say.\n\nHe turns this over like a coin. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem petty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait until you see me with a printer jam.\u201d\n\nHe smiles as if he is making a note. A gull shrieks in the distance like a kettle boiling over, and then everything is quiet in the way houses go quiet when they realize you might fall asleep in them.\n\nMum comes in, removes invisible lint from my shoulder, touches Kit\u2019s hair like he is not actually twenty-six but a boy with jam on his face. \u201cWe have a plan for the weekend,\u201d she says, as if she is issuing a royal decree. \u201cKit, you\u2019ve never seen Smeaton\u2019s Tower up close. It is the time for lighthouses. We will go. We will walk along the Hoe, and Gareth will pretend he is a tour guide, and I will spend too much on hot chocolate.\u201d\n\nKit blinks in the way people do when warmth is unfamiliar. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cYes. I like\u2026 towers that used to be elsewhere.\u201d\n\nI love him for that sentence, briefly and inexplicably. People reveal themselves accidentally. They say one true thing and the rest of the sentences make room for it.\n\nI leave before ten because mornings come regardless of who you loved the night before. I hug Mum and she squeezes me until I exhale more than the air in my lungs. Gareth claps my back. Kit walks me to the door, and there\u2019s a pause that feels like a hallway, that feels like both a risk and a courtesy.\n\nHe says, \u201cI don\u2019t know anyone here. That\u2019s not a complaint. It\u2019s\u2026 I just don\u2019t know if I will be good at it. Being here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of weather,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd boats. And people who tell their life story to the person who sells them shampoo.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me like he\u2019s taking a picture with his brain. \u201cYou\u2019ll show me where to stand so the wind doesn\u2019t make me into a joke?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can recommend walls,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd tea.\u201d\n\nHe nods. His voice falls into the soft register reserved for bedtime and hospitals. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nOn my walk home the pavements shine as if they have been carefully licked clean. The city is a series of corners I know too well. In the window of the charity shop there\u2019s a shirt that looks like something my father would have worn\u2014white with tiny blue squares, the compromise between boldness and a meeting\u2014and I almost go in to buy it, then don\u2019t. The hot breath of the kebab shop gusts into the cold. Near my street I pass a man with a dog wearing a hi-vis jacket that says I AM NERVOUS, and I nod at him like I am, too.\n\nIn bed I do not imagine Kit\u2019s hands; I am careful. I do not allow this to be a story about anything other than a new person at Mum\u2019s, a house with extra laughter and a depth of shoes by the door. I am almost thirty and I have learned to name my feelings in bland colors: concern, interest, the slight ache that comes with moving a new box into the house of your head. I tell myself, sternly, that there is a line and it is marked, bright as hazard tape.\n\nIt would be easy to say that I slept poorly because the mattress is old. It would be easy to say it was the wind. But the truth is, sometimes the heart resists scheduling. It wanders the corridors at night touching all the doorknobs, checking if they are locked.\n\nFriday comes like the sea, with that patient power. I shuffle my way through another onslaught of ailments. I tell three different people that a teaspoon is not a valid measurement unless it\u2019s an actual teaspoon designed for medicine, not something inherited from a grandmother who used it to stir memories. I counsel a teenager on the difference between moisturizer and magic. I call a doctor who forgot a decimal point; he laughs a brittle laugh and says thanks in a tone that means don\u2019t tell anyone. In the afternoon, a man brings in a prescription with his hands shaking, and when I offer him a glass of water, he refuses, but later comes back and buys a bottle.\n\nBetween customers I imagine what Kit is doing. Carrying boxes up the stairs two at a time. Opening and closing cupboard doors simply to hear the sound they make. Accidentally sleeping in the middle of the day because the silence has misled him. I hate myself a little for caring so easily. Quiet boys are dangerous that way; we stash affection like contraband and one day there\u2019s simply too much to hide.\n\nOn Saturday I meet them on the Hoe. The lighthouse is the same color it always is, as if nothing has ever happened to it, despite the fact that it was lifted up and moved like furniture. Mum comes at me with her coat flapping like a flag. Gareth wears a scarf he probably ironed. Kit stands slightly apart, hands in the pockets of a jacket the color of slate, watching the water as if the water might relay instructions.\n\nWe climb the stairs inside the lighthouse, round and round, stepping where so many feet have stepped, the smell of paint and salt and tourism. At the top the entire city offers itself: the Sound dark and full of secrets, Mount Edgcumbe hunched in its own green pauses, the ferries like ideas drifting toward France. Wind takes every loose thought and skims it into the water. Mum presses her palm to the glass and says, \u201cImagine keeping everyone safe just by shining.\u201d\n\nGareth talks about the engineering because he cannot help it. Kit looks at the mechanism like he could write a song about gears. Beside me he leans, very slightly, a degree, into the space where my shoulder is. We stand just far enough apart to call it coincidence. He says, \u201cDo you ever feel like you\u2019re walking around inside something that someone else made and you\u2019re trying to remember to say thank you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d I say.\n\nHe keeps looking at the horizon like it is a word he can\u2019t remember. \u201cI like it here,\u201d he says. \u201cNot to be dramatic. But I like that I can see the edges of things. Bristol felt like everything wanted to be bigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis place is a stubborn paragraph,\u201d I say. \u201cIt refuses to be rewritten.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me, then away, then back, as if checking the traffic. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I am\u2026 adequate in Plymouth.\u201d\n\nHe laughs that soft, true laugh. Mum takes our picture without warning. Later I see it on her phone: Kit and I not quite looking at the lens, faces turned toward each other and the light, no reason for anyone to detect any treason, two men who might be friends.\n\nWe walk, we eat chips, we let seagulls tell us we are wrong about everything. Mum spends money on hot chocolate she could have made at home, because Mum believes in making days feel like days. Gareth buys a fudge he will claim is for later and then eat on a bench. Kit tells me about his band and their current loss of a drummer. I tell him about Mr. Leland who keeps trying to get me to sell him antibiotics \u201cjust in case\u201d for his cat. He tells me about Bristol street markets, the way a crowd can feel like a song when you stand in it right. I tell him about a woman who comes in every Friday to buy exactly three cough drops and the way her hands shake when she counts change.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon he texts me a photograph of a bundle of cables: Do we think these are alive? I reply: Only emotionally.\n\nHe sends another. A book spine cracked down the middle: This was a bad idea. I say: All ideas are better with tape.\n\nMonday, he asks if I\u2019ll help him find a place to get a spare key cut. Wednesday, he arrives at the pharmacy with a box of biscuits to offer to Janet \u201cfor being the woman who has already told me to buy a proper coat\u201d. He stands at the end of the counter, out of the way, and watches me do my work with a focused curiosity, as if I\u2019m performing at a very quiet concert.\n\n\u201cYou were rude to the printer,\u201d he says afterward.\n\n\u201cThe printer and I are not on speaking terms,\u201d I say.\n\nWe walk home together along a street where the houses are all trying to be taller than each other. He tells me about his mother in Scotland, who texts him photographs of clouds and never uses punctuation. \u201cShe\u2019s a good person,\u201d he says, which I have decided is the most honest way to describe anyone. He asks me about my father and I tell him the bare facts: Leeds, once; a cabinet maker who didn\u2019t make any cabinet I ever used; a man whose laughter sounded like a door closing.\n\nWe fall into a kind of gentle orbit. He comes to the pharmacy at the end of my shift sometimes and leans against the doorframe like the idea of leaning was invented for him. He buys plasters just to have something to place on the counter, and calls me \u201cMr. Pharmacist\u201d in a voice that would get him served first in a crowded bar. We go to the pub with Gareth and Mum and share a packet of crisps like a treaty. He tells me a secret about a song he wrote in the bath; I tell him the names of the medicines that sound like planets.\n\nI set my boundaries like a picket fence I paint white in my mind. I watch myself obey them. I do fine until he says one night, in Mum\u2019s living room when everyone else has gone to bed, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could start again. Not a big start. Just\u2026 I thought I was too far into being me for it to be useful. But I\u2019m here, and I wanted to tell you that you are part of why that doesn\u2019t feel like a trick.\u201d\n\nI look at the carpet. One of Mum\u2019s tulip vases is crooked. My pulse behaves itself but takes off a jacket and stays a while. \u201cYou\u2019ll say that to a lot of people,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cIt\u2019s your charm.\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head, slowly, so I understand that he has considered it. \u201cNo. You are different.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been here long enough to know that,\u201d I say. It\u2019s an easy lie to walk around.\n\nHe nods once, accepting my evasion like a gift. \u201cOkay. Then I\u2019ll wait to know it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodnight,\u201d I say, and it is both a goodbye and a promise to survive until morning.\n\nAfter that, there are days when I think I\u2019m fine and days when a careless question rips something. Someone asks me at work if I have siblings and I say no automatically, as if I\u2019m still ten. Then I remember that life has a way of making new doors out of old walls. I don\u2019t correct myself. It\u2019s easier. If I don\u2019t name it, perhaps it rearranges itself into something harmless.\n\nAt the end of the month, Mum throws a small dinner for the way February dilutes into March. A new friend of Gareth\u2019s comes, a woman named Izzy with hair like a kind of celebration. We eat something with chorizo and lentils and laugh at the radio. Kit has a new shirt with space on it for more living. I help clear plates because it gives purpose to the hands. In the kitchen he stands too close because the kitchen is small.\n\n\u201cDo you ever feel like you are making it up as you go along?\u201d he says, leaning against the counter, the good light making him more real than some days.\n\n\u201cConstantly,\u201d I say. \u201cI pretend to know where to put the knives.\u201d\n\nHe grins and then stops, his face thoughtful. \u201cI keep trying to think of good reasons to be brave. I think you might be one of them.\u201d\n\nIn the dining room a laugh breaks like crockery. Mum calls, \u201cIs anyone looking for the custard?\u201d and the window fogs slightly with the heat of boiling water. The house is so alive with us you could put a stethoscope to the wall.\n\nI say, because it\u2019s the only thing that doesn\u2019t feel like a theft, \u201cI like that you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nHe breathes in, as if someone opened a door in him to a colder room. His hand lifts like it might press mine; it doesn\u2019t. He nods as though to commit the sentence to memory. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\nAfter the guests have gone and Mum and Gareth have done their affectionate choreography down the hall, I sit on the sofa and listen to the waves in the dark. Kit sits on the floor, back against the coffee table, knees up like small hills. The conversation takes place in fragments. \u201cThere is a man,\u201d he says carefully, \u201cwho told me once that I was easy to leave. He meant it as an apology. I took it as a threat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was not kind,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cIt was accurate, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d I say. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. I only met you when you were already staying.\u201d\n\nHe tips his head, that acknowledgement you give someone you weren\u2019t expecting to meet on a path. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying. I\u2019m not\u2026 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m trying to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlive,\u201d I say. \u201cThat seems to be the general trend.\u201d\n\nHe laughs again, the laugh I would keep in a jar if I could. Then we are both quiet, and there\u2019s a current in the room like the kind in a river, the one that looks slow and is not. Everything that is not a choice tries to make itself known. We sit inside a small, dense moment where any sentence could be a bridge or a wall. We choose neither. Sometimes not choosing is its own kind of courage. We say goodnight in a voice that belongs to a different story, and go to our separate rooms, and sleep like men who have built something out of air.\n\nBy April, we have a pattern. On Mondays we eat with Mum. On Tuesdays we walk down to the barbican and count how many couples hold hands. On Wednesdays he sits in my tiny kitchen and tells me how a song becomes a room you can enter. I tell him how a pill knows where to go. On Thursdays we pretend we are not disappointed when the evening is ordinary. On Fridays we watch a documentary about lighthouses and both pretend not to notice the subtext. We don\u2019t touch because there is a line and we respect lines, even when they wander.\n\nHe starts picking up shifts at a music shop near Royal Parade, the kind of place where you can buy a dream for ninety-nine pounds and carry it home in a case. He comes to the pharmacy afterward and smells like guitar strings, as if metal could have a scent. We talk about the woman with three cough drops, about Gareth\u2019s habit of hiding biscuits at the back of the cupboard and then not remembering. Mum invents reasons for both of us to be in the same room. I believe she might be a benevolent tyrant.\n\nAnd then one evening, because all evenings decide their own mood, Kit doesn\u2019t come to the pharmacy, doesn\u2019t text, doesn\u2019t arrive at Mum\u2019s. Later I receive a message: Sorry. Bristol thing. Tomorrow?\n\nTomorrow will be a different place. Tonight I walk down by the water because the city sounds the way my head feels. I think of him at the old flat, or with old friends, or confronting some old version of himself he would rather not see. The sea is the only thing that doesn\u2019t pretend to be brave; it just is. I sit on a bench I have sat on in three different years of my life, and I count the lights that blink on; I imagine asking him to be kinder to himself. I go home with my hands in my pockets like they might do something useful, and a gull whose tail looks like someone has painted over part of the evening keeps following me for a block, making a noise like a broken whistle.\n\nThe next day, when he shows up, his eyes are a little red around the edges like he\u2019s been walking in the wind too long.\n\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d I ask as neutrally as a pharmacist in the aisle.\n\nHe nods and then shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m not a liar,\u201d he says, and smiles as if he\u2019s been caught. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. I just\u2026 Bristol. It\u2019s hard to leave a place you could still fail in. You keep thinking, what if I fail somewhere else instead. And then you realize failure is an item you pack by accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave a seat,\u201d I say, gesturing at the spot on the floor behind the counter that is technically for staff only. \u201cI\u2019ve got two minutes.\u201d\n\nHe stands. \u201cIf I sit, I might stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cThen don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe nods. He stares at the packets of paracetamol like they might offer counsel. \u201cDo you ever feel like you need to do something stupid just to prove you\u2019re not a piece of furniture?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrequently,\u201d I say. \u201cI use different words, but yes.\u201d\n\nHe pulls in a breath like a rope. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do something that my father will hate,\u201d he says, and his mouth shapes a smile that isn\u2019t one. \u201cI think I need to.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I say, because sometimes the job is to trust the person you can\u2019t fix. \u201cLet me know if you need someone to say stop.\u201d\n\nHe takes his hands out of his pockets and takes the little moment and holds it like a pebble. \u201cThanks,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re good at standing in the doorway.\u201d\n\nAnd that is how things go when they are going toward their own center. The decisions occur like weather. The afternoon goes by in blister packs and the itch of a too-small shirt. At closing time the printer jams and unjams itself as if it has its own narrative arc. I clean the counter until I can see my face in it. I turn the key and step out into an air that has decided to be clear. Somewhere in the city, someone is doing something they will regret. Somewhere else, someone is opening a box and finding the thing they forgot they bought. It is not my job to know which is which. It is my job to count the pills, to be kind, to lock the door.\n\nAnd yet, as I walk home, my steps are half a beat out of rhythm, thinking of Kit\u2019s breath and the phrase he used, like a warning to himself\u2014something his father will hate. I don\u2019t know the shape of it. I only know the feeling of it scraping against the inside of my chest, a tide turning, a boat untied.",

I unlock the pharmacy and the air inside has that small, clean hush, the sound of a room waiting to be useful. The printer eyes me with the suspicion of a cat and then starts, grudgingly, as if we have agreed to disagree. Janet arrives with her tote bag and her municipal cheerfulness, arranges her teas in a row like a tiny parliament, and watches me for a heartbeat longer than usual as I fiddle a label back into alignment. When I finally meet her look she tilts her head and says, \u201cYou\u2019re somewhere else this morning, love. Bring your body back or I\u2019ll bill you per daydream.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m precisely where my feet are,\u201d I say, which is technically true and emotionally adjacent. \u201cMy brain is doing inventory.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn what, feelings?\u201d She shakes a sachet like a maraca, then sighs when the kettle takes longer than a heartbeat to boil. \u201cDo not inventory feelings before ten. Company policy. Also, you\u2019ll come up short and have to cook the books.\u201d\n\nA woman who looks like she was once good at skipping rope asks for something for a cough she\u2019s had since Christmas and then requests a lipstick recommendation as if these are both diseases. A man with a plaster across his left eyebrow says he\u2019s here for his warfarin but leaves with a lecture on grapefruit. The methadone clients shuffle in at their quiet tempo, and I measure out what brings them level, then watch until the swallow has become a swallow and not a trick. When there\u2019s a lull big enough to leave a chair in, Janet leans against the counter and rubs at a smear of something imaginary. \u201cDo you remember that boy,\u201d she says, \u201cwho kept buying hair gel and condoms and Red Bull like a Courage Kit? I saw him last night pushing a pram. He looked bewildered and content.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember him,\u201d I say, and feel the odd displacement that comes when someone from your life exists loudly in theirs. \u201cHe always asked if mint made you sterile.\u201d\n\n\u201cA myth,\u201d she says, all professionalism. \u201cBut useful for some mothers of teenage boys.\u201d She finishes her tea and taps her fingernail on the cup. \u201cAnd you. Are you bewildered and content?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlternating,\u201d I say. \u201cI think the tide is out at the moment.\u201d\n\nShe squints at me in that way she has when she is measuring a dose without measuring a dose. \u201cWeather changes,\u201d she says, and nods at the stack of prescriptions like they are a deck of cards we are both pretending is fair.\n\nAround midday a man in a fluorescent jacket asks me to look at a rash \u201cnear but not on my important parts\u201d and we both do the dance of dignity that such requests require. A child buys a packet of jelly beans with coins that have clearly traveled through three trousers to get here, and tells me her rabbit is named Clover, which feels like a benediction. I call a GP to query a dose that would have knocked down a small horse and we share a minute of brittle laughter that acknowledges what could have been and is not. I move the day along with my hands and then, without warning, it is four and my phone vibrates in my pocket like an insistent thought. It is Kit, and his message is not a set of words I can file neatly: Can you come by after work. If you can\u2019t, okay. If you can, please bring your calm voice.\n\nI read it twice as if the second reading might reveal a trick. I tell myself he is asking because I am the nearest to hand, the way you grab the mug at the front of the shelf, not because it is your favorite. At six I lock the till with a little ferocity and Janet hums at me like a person who has chosen humming over meddling. \u201cTell your mum her lavender is bullying my sinuses,\u201d she says at the door, and when I say, \u201cIt\u2019s mine she bullies first,\u201d she grins and flicks my sleeve. \u201cKindness,\u201d she says, \u201cis not the same as softness. Remember that.\u201d\n\nThe walk to Mum\u2019s feels like a rehearsal for something I haven\u2019t practiced. The light is in that hour where it all looks like a photograph if you just hold still. Gareth\u2019s car is not in the driveway, which is a fact I put in my pocket like a mint I might need later. Mum answers the door with a rubber band around her wrist and a hair clip in her mouth, and she beams around the clip like a woman who can do four things at once. \u201cSweetheart. He\u2019s in the spare room. I am not interfering. I am simply adjacent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything,\u201d I say, and she pats my cheek as if to acknowledge that saying nothing is, in fact, a lot.\n\nKit is sitting on the floor amidst the boxes like a man who has interrupted his own escape. He looks at me with a mixture of relief and apology and then gestures at the agglomeration of cardboard as if he might introduce us. \u201cI made a mess,\u201d he says, which is both true and a code for something else.\n\n\u201cI believe in mess,\u201d I say, stepping around a coil of cable that could have been a sleeping snake. \u201cIt\u2019s proof something is happening.\u201d\n\nHe rubs his fingers over the edge of a book as if testing its temperature. \u201cI have two options,\u201d he says, and then shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s rubbish. I have four, if I\u2019m honest, and I like none of them because they all implicate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds promising,\u201d I say, and sit on the edge of the guest bed, which creaks like it has been waiting to be included. \u201cTry me with option one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOption one: I stay here and try to become a person in a house and see if the house will have me.\u201d He looks toward the hallway where Mum is not listening, theatrically. \u201cDad would like that. It would make him feel like he threaded a needle he\u2019s been staring at for years. Option two: I go back to Bristol and do a thunderclap exit that convinces no one, least of all me. Option three: I find somewhere near here that is mine and then fail somewhere local. Option four,\u201d he says, and he swallows, which is a ridiculous act of courage considering the options sound like a maths problem with emotions. \u201cOption four is that I ask a person I like if I can borrow their life for a bit and see if I fit in the space they have. I think my father would like options that are not four. Which makes me suspicious of them.\u201d\n\nThe bed and I both become very still. The house, that collaborative creature, stops settling for a moment as if it knows the sentence that is about to be born. \u201cBorrow,\u201d I say, and the word is gentler than my pulse deserves. \u201cThe library is open but very small.\u201d\n\nHe laughs, quick and low, and then spreads his hands in surrender. \u201cI don\u2019t mean in a way that would make your flat less yours. I don\u2019t want to dig up your plants and replace them with my bad habits. I mean\u2026 a corner? A couch? A place to learn where the light switches are in the dark, with someone who won\u2019t find that pathetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a couch,\u201d I say, and my voice sounds like I have lain it out to dry on a line. \u201cIt is capable of being a bed if you are short, and you are only short in inches, not in any of the ways that matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cDad will hate it,\u201d he says, and the smile in his mouth sits strangely there. \u201cHe will think I am running away and running toward the wrong thing at the same time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe will think you are leaving his house,\u201d I say, and the honesty is a glass of cold water between us. \u201cHe has a right to have feelings. You have a right to have a door you can close. I can\u2019t tell you what makes sense. I can tell you I have clean sheets that do not match and a kettle that boils quickly.\u201d\n\nHe nods like a man who has been coaxed down from an edge by the idea of tea. We sit with the idea until it becomes not an idea but a possible Tuesday. Mum knocks in a manner that suggests she has never learned the art of not hearing. She sticks her head around the door and surveys us both with the fond caution of a woman observing two cats in the same room for the first time. \u201cIs anyone hungry?\u201d she says, which is her way of saying I approve, conditionally. \u201cThere\u2019s soup, which is also my way of admitting I forgot to make bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways hungry,\u201d Kit says, and he stands with that sudden grace he has, and the room breathes again as if it had held its breath on our behalf. We eat soup with spoons that have a million small scratches which, if you listen hard enough, sound like a history. Mum does not ask me what we decided because she can tell and also because she has decided that not asking is the kindest way to be nosy.\n\nThe conversation with Gareth happens later and is not mine. I leave when his key turns in the lock because I am not a spectator at that particular sport. On my walk home the lights in the terraced windows perform a lesson in other people\u2019s evenings. A woman stirs a pot with the kind of intent that suggests something else in her life is out of her control. A boy in a red jumper bounces a ball against the skirting board and will one day call this noise memory. A man leans against his kitchen counter and stares at the device in his hand as if it might deliver a verdict. I put my hand on my door and feel the little hum of electricity inside, the house already welcoming the idea that it will be asked for a favor.\n\nI clean in the way that means I am both nervous and polite. I shake out the throw as if it required negotiation. I find a set of sheets that don\u2019t argue with each other. I move my books so that there is space on the shelf for another person\u2019s spines to glance out. When the knock comes it is not tentative but not bold, either. He stands there with a duffel bag that looks like it has traveled across decades and a guitar case that looks like hope\u2019s luggage. His face is tired around the edges but his eyes are, somehow, steady. \u201cHe didn\u2019t hate me,\u201d he says, and a laugh that is only theoretically a laugh escapes. \u201cHe hated the idea. Which is progress. He said was I going to pay you rent and was I going to make you late to work. I told him yes and no and not in that order.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe loves you,\u201d I say, and take the bag from him because my hands need something to do other than reach. \u201cHe is learning the verb in real time.\u201d\n\nThe couch becomes a destination. We talk the way people talk when chairs are low to the ground and time is soft around the edges. He tells me about a memory of a kitchen in Scotland where the windows steamed in a way that made it seem like the house was breathing. I tell him about the time I got locked in the pharmacy stockroom and had to call Janet and we both laughed so hard we sat on opposite sides of the door like a scene in a farce. He looks at my shelves with the curiosity of a person who understands that books organize a brain. \u201cYou shelve by feeling,\u201d he says, tracing the air. \u201cThat\u2019s scandalous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a rebel,\u201d I say. \u201cNext I will put paracetamol next to the jelly beans and see what happens.\u201d\n\nWe do not talk about lines but we treat them with great respect. We do not mention the possibility that I could be an option five by accident. We fall asleep with a hallway of air between us and still somehow the room feels like a held breath. In the morning he apologizes for snoring and I tell him it sounded like a small, non-urgent engine and he looks at me like I have invented a name for something he thought had to be ugly.\n\nAt the pharmacy the day is brighter simply because it is formed of decisions made and not made for me. Janet notices the additional curve at the corner of my mouth and pretends not to. \u201cI dreamt about soup,\u201d she announces, which is how she says I am glad you are okay. A mother and daughter debate the ethics of dry shampoo. Mr. Leland attempts to extract amoxicillin from me with the persuasive tone of a man who believes repetition is charm. I counsel a woman through the unjustness of menopause side effects with a small pile of leaflets and the bigger, invisible thing of listening. At three Kit brings me lunch because he is sunshine in a jacket and hands me a box with \u201cI didn\u2019t know what you\u2019d like so I panic-assembled everything\u201d inside. We stand in the staff doorway sharing a fork like a treaty and he says, mouth full, \u201cI told the music shop I could do afternoons and not mornings and the man with the eyebrows told me mornings are when the good decisions get made and I told him that had not been my experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re brave,\u201d I say, and he shakes his head, then nods, then shrugs as if bravery is a jacket that doesn\u2019t quite fit.\n\nThat evening I show him where I keep the good mugs and the emergency biscuits and the drawer where utensils go to sulk. He showers and leaves the mirror fogged, and I wipe a circle in it with my sleeve, which later feels like a small intimacy I should not have enjoyed. He installs his chargers into the socket with the precision of a mission that matters, and I plug my phone in alongside his and watch the little lightning icon appear next to both our names and understand that\u2019s what it feels like when a routine absorbs you without spitting you out.\n\nMum, of course, calls. She manages to say how are you and is he settling and don\u2019t forget to defrost the sausages and your grandfather never minded a couch bed all in one breath. Gareth texts me a decent thank you in the tone of a man trying to drive a tight bend without braking. He is awkward and I am awkward and we both do our best to trust the other with our respective clumsiness. There is a relief in being old enough to admit that adult feelings require child language.\n\nDays accrue in their small, meaningful way. We develop systems without agreeing to call them that. His guitar case lives behind the chair with the wobbly leg which, in a charming coincidence, stops wobbling when leaned against. He buys pegs and uses them to clip my tea towels in a manner that suggests he knew they needed disciplining. I learn the sound of his footsteps when he is thinking and the sound when he is about to ask a question that might change the temperature of the room. He learns my kettle\u2019s mood swings and the exact noise the printer makes in my head when I am angry at it. We go to the supermarket together and become a parody of domestic joy, arguing about pasta shapes like we have been published on the subject. In the cereal aisle he lifts a box to the light and reads the ingredients out loud and pronounces them a work of fiction, then puts the box in the basket anyway. We are, in this way, building a story that threatens to believe in itself.\n\nOne afternoon, a Wednesday dressed up as a Friday, he arrives at the pharmacy at four and waits, hands in pockets, while I finish telling a woman about the noble and limited powers of antihistamines. When I am free he says, \u201cWhen you finish, can I take you somewhere?\u201d and his voice does that soft thing it does when he has planned something small that he hopes will loom big. At six we walk up to the Hoe, then past it, then further, until the city drops away like a polite curtain and we are on a bit of cliff that is not particularly secret but which the wind has claimed as its rehearsal space. He points to a fence with carefully spaced planks and says, \u201cThis is where I came the first time I got lost here. I realized if I could count the planks I could count myself here. One, two, three, not lost.\u201d\n\nWe stand with our backs warmed by the idea of the city and our faces stung by the fact of the weather. He says, in the tone of someone presenting a problem to a committee, \u201cI keep thinking about whether there is a kind way to make something that will hurt someone. I keep thinking about how \u2018kind\u2019 might be the wrong goal. Maybe I aim for true, and deal with kind like salt at the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cSalt at the end is wise,\u201d I say. \u201cSalt too early becomes the point. Are we cooking or mixing metaphors?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re fishing,\u201d he says, and laughs at his own nonsense, then turns serious so fast it\u2019s dizzying. \u201cI want to tell you something my father will not want to hear, in a language he will understand. I don\u2019t know that language yet. All the ones I have are songs or apologies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could start with the one you speak to yourself,\u201d I say, and watch him as he measures that suggestion. \u201cIt will have an accent but it\u2019s the most honest.\u201d\n\nHe nods but says nothing and we let the wind say the part where we hug without hugging. We go home and the smell of the stairwell tells us which neighbor made curry and which bought cigarettes. He takes a shower and sings half a verse of something that hasn\u2019t had a chorus attached yet. I sit at the table and open a letter from the NHS reminding me that my body is a machine that likes being looked at on a schedule and, for the first time in months, I do not resent my cells for their insistence on being checked.\n\nIt happens on a Thursday because of course it does. By now Thursdays have become a space where news sits because it has nowhere else to go. We are at Mum\u2019s for dinner because the lure of mashed potatoes has bested my grown-up sense of proportion. Gareth is more quiet than usual, which for a man who is often a human trumpet is saying something. Mum floats around the table replenishing things that do not need replenishing. Kit not only uses his napkin but actually puts it on his lap without being told. The radio plays something from the nineties that pretends to be cheerful. When we have achieved the full rack of plates and empty bowls and the soft fatigue that comes after food has been kind, Gareth clears his throat in the manner of a man summoning an audience without wanting one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been\u2026\u201d he begins, and then he pauses to assemble his face, which is a better man than I am. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking about how this last year, I\u2019ve been very lucky. I\u2019ve got a job that does not involve me swearing at idiots, mostly. I\u2019ve got a house where my shoes have somewhere to be. I\u2019ve got\u2014\u201d he gestures at Mum and he doesn\u2019t have to finish the sentence because he is not a fool \u201c\u2014and my son, the fact of him, which is not new but the having is.\u201d He looks at Kit the way carpenters look at a piece of wood that is both exactly itself and also possibly a shelf one day. \u201cI have\u2026 feelings about changes. I am trying to have them without shouting. I am trying to hold them and also not use them as weapons. I don\u2019t want to lose what I\u2019ve just got, which is to say, I am jealous of the idea that someone else gets you when I do not.\u201d\n\nKit puts his hand flat on the table, palm down, like a declaration without words. \u201cI am not an object,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cBut I know what you mean. I hate that I understand this from both ends.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re not,\u201d Gareth says and winces at himself like a boy caught being clumsy. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to leave this house because of me. But I don\u2019t want you to not leave because of me either. Christ, I\u2019m saying this badly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying it,\u201d Mum says, with the gentleness of a woman who knows the great labor of words. \u201cThat is not a small thing.\u201d\n\nI chew the inside of my cheek and taste metal, and I say nothing because this is not a scene where my voice is the correct instrument. Kit reaches out, flips his hand, and puts his palm up, offering it, empty. Gareth looks at it, then at his son\u2019s face, then some place above his head where guilt often perches, and he puts his own hand over it. They don\u2019t hold on for long, just long enough to agree that they have hands and that hands, used well, do not only fix wood.\n\nLater, in the kitchen, Mum pretends to wash three plates that are already clean so she can keep me there. She says, without turning around, \u201cYou know the thing where you think you\u2019re watching a play and then it\u2019s your scene and you have no lines?\u201d She turns then, and the light catches the silver at her temple she refuses to dye. \u201cThat\u2019s all that\u2019s happening. Don\u2019t be cross at yourself for not having a script. Your kindness is big enough to say no and to say yes. Use it for yourself as much as you do for other people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am trying,\u201d I say, which is not a victory cry but it is also not an apology. \u201cI do not know where the edge is.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt moves,\u201d she says, and hands me a towel that has become thin with being useful.\n\nWhen Kit and I walk home, the city is in one of those moods where it becomes a set, with lights and extras and the possibility of a plot twist. He says, \u201cThank you,\u201d and when I ask for what he says, \u201cFor letting me have a place to put down the part of me that wants to pick up everything,\u201d which is a ridiculous sentence until you have felt the exact weight of it. In my flat he stands at the window and leans his forehead against the glass as if he could breathe better if the pane would let him. I stand beside him, not touching, because that is our game, and after a minute he laughs under his breath and says, \u201cDo you ever get the sense you\u2019re about to be someone you remember later?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd then I look for small reasons not to narrate it like I\u2019m clever.\u201d\n\nHe turns, very slightly, which is the unit of measurement we use for great movement. He says my name in a tone I have not allowed to exist in this room and then stops, his mouth doing the brave thing of not finding a word quickly. \u201cI am going to do one more thing my father will hate,\u201d he says, and now the smile is not sad but also not triumphant. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to do it kindly. If I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can try,\u201d I say, and my heart tightens like a hand on a railing. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to tell him the truth about who I like,\u201d he says, and the sentence is in the present tense but it lands like a thrown stone finally arriving at a pond. \u201cI told myself I didn\u2019t need to. I told myself it was mine and none of his. But I\u2019m tired of pretending my life is polite. I can be kind and not be polite. And I would like to stop acting like all roads must pass through other people\u2019s tolls.\u201d\n\nThere is a very quiet noise in my chest that answers to relief and fear with the same name. I feel my face learn to be simple. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say. \u201cDo you want me there?\u201d\n\nHe shakes his head then nods then laughs at himself as if he has been caught in a loop. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cYes. No. I think\u2026 not for the telling. I think I need to speak my own language first. But afterwards can I come here and be with someone who won\u2019t translate it into something it isn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can always come here,\u201d I say, and I mean it with the steadiness you bring to a promise you intend to keep until something larger than you says stop.\n\nHe kisses me then. Not like a theft and not like a trumpet. It is a steady thing, a sentence he has been practicing under his breath and has finally decided he knows. It is not a surprise and it is entirely a surprise and it is a hundred tiny, practical truths rewritten into a different order. I have been a steward of no for months and I do not feel like I am betraying him or me by saying yes in the language of a mouth. We both draw back like men who have stepped over a line painted on the pavement by no one official but visible anyway. He rests his head against mine for a moment and we both breathe, which is the only proof either of us has that we are alive.\n\nWe do not sleep badly but we sleep in a room where the air has introduced new rules. In the morning he eats toast like he\u2019s concentrating and I make tea like it\u2019s a decision. He goes to see Gareth in the afternoon because he says Thursdays deserve their consequence. I go to the pharmacy and do my job with attention because attention is the only way to keep from trying to skip ahead to a page that hasn\u2019t been written. Janet eyes me like a woman who has lived long enough to recognize when people have rearranged their furniture. When I finally tell her, in the smallest number of words, what is about to happen, she considers, then says, \u201cHe will still be his father when it is done. You will still be you. That is the only certainty. You do not get to pick other people\u2019s edges.\u201d\n\nAt half four I find myself staring at the clock not because the day is long but because the day is suddenly exact. At five, my phone vibrates on the counter with a message of three words that are not dramatic and somehow still are: Can I come. I text back: Yes, obviously, and then I wipe the counter down with such dedication that the spritz smell of lemon becomes a mood. He arrives twenty minutes later, walks behind the counter on the wrong side of a sign that says staff only and leans his forehead against my shoulder like that is the only part of him that needs to rest. I put my palm between his shoulder blades and feel the small, noble bones there and we both stand like that until it becomes ridiculous to be tender in a room that sells foot powder.\n\nWe walk home and he tells me the story as if it is a set of bruise colors. He says, \u201cHe did not shout and he did not clap. He did something worse and better. He said, \u2018Alright,\u2019 and then he said, \u2018Is it him?\u2019 and I said, \u2018It doesn\u2019t matter who it is; it matters who I am,\u2019 and he said, \u2018It matters if it\u2019s him because I need to know what kind of pain I\u2019m supposed to be feeling,\u2019 and then we both sat down like chairs someone had forgotten to put away.\u201d He breathes in the careful way of a man leaving a room that was humid with unshed things. \u201cI said it wasn\u2019t an accident, and it wasn\u2019t a phase, and it wasn\u2019t a trick designed to make him prove he was a good father. I said it was the way I am when I am not trying to be anything else. He said he wanted to be a person who didn\u2019t mind but that he was a person who minded and he hated that. I said I was sorry he was hurting but I wasn\u2019t sorry about me.\u201d\n\nWe turn onto my street and a dog in a little yellow coat leaps at a leaf like it is applause. He watches the dog with a small smile that might live in a museum. \u201cAnd then,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause he knows he isn\u2019t owed gentleness but he wants it anyway, he said, \u2018Will you be careful with him,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yes, but I don\u2019t know what we are, so my care might look odd,\u2019 and he laughed almost properly and said \u2018Odd is fine.\u2019 We cried a bit and hugged like men who learned it on YouTube. Mum came in at the end with a custard tart as if she had been waiting and said, \u2018Well good then, that\u2019s sorted,\u2019 which was both a lie and a plan.\u201d\n\nWe climb my stairs as if we have never had to lift our feet before. In the flat he stands in the middle of the room like a person who has cleanly untied a knot and is waiting to see what the rope can do. I boil the kettle because sometimes progress needs assistance. He sits on the couch that is his couch now, and looks at the window and the lamp and the place where his charger lives, and his throat moves when he swallows and then he says, like a man deciding not to ask permission from the rest of his life, \u201cI would like to kiss you again. We do not have to call it anything. We can keep it in this room like an experiment that doesn\u2019t leave the lab.\u201d\n\nI put the tea down and the light from the window makes him look like a person in a painting about living quietly through storms. \u201cOkay,\u201d I say, and this time the yes has no other language upon it. We kiss like people who believe in instructions and like people who know when to ignore them, and it is both a relief and a complication and also not a disaster, which is an underrated category. Later we drink the tea and it tastes like something warm that might become a memory, and we sit with the door closed, which is not a metaphor but cannot help being one.\n\nWe do not call anyone. We do not tell a friend whose job it is to turn news into a round of congratulations. We do not pretend we are different men. We wash up the mugs and we choose a set of ordinary sentences to say next and we both practice how to breathe while nothing burns down. In bed I do not pretend not to imagine his hands; imagination is not a crime if you have an alibi of honesty. I name my feelings in the slightly brighter colors that come after you have admitted you have a box in your head and you have opened it. I tell myself that a line can become a path if you walk along it long enough and pay attention.\n\nIn the morning, everything is both the same and embossed. We perform our rituals with reverence because there is now a choir humming underneath. He leaves for the shop with his guitar case and his courage and a sandwich that thinks it is a meal. I go to the pharmacy with my kind eyes and my printer grievances and a growing acceptance that love, if this is what we are building, is less a lightning strike than a series of extremely competent flicks of a switch. At ten, a woman tells me she is frightened of her own temperature and I talk her down with a cup of water and the arresting fact that bodies like numbers but not numbers without context. At midday, Janet mutters \u201cWell then\u201d to herself and later confesses that her ex-husband has asked her to a concert and she intends to wear the red coat that makes her feel like a business plan. At two, a man drops his box of lancets and I crouch with him to gather them as if they are chess pieces.\n\nAt four, my phone vibrates with a text from Mum that is an art gallery of emojis and the words Proud of you both, which suggests I did not keep a secret as well as I imagined. At five, I close the till and the door and stand for a second in the little square of the shop that has held so many versions of me, and I let the moment admit that it is good. Outside, the sky remembers how to be blue, not because anyone told it to but because it is in its nature. The gulls are loud and wrong and absolutely themselves. I walk home with my hands empty and my pockets full, and in my head I am already making a shopping list that includes a second pillow and more tea and a practice of saying yes out loud when no one is listening so that when I need it, the word is ready.",

We go on pretending we are very effective furniture movers, carrying small pieces of our lives from one room to another without dropping anything that would shatter. There are new objects that make claims on the flat\u2014his toothbrush that looks like it knows all the ways a mouth can be forgiven, a T-shirt draped over the back of a chair that refuses to be folded because it is occupied with smelling like him, a pick tin, round and rattly, washing up on the coffee table like something the sea forgot to swallow. My kettle begins to understand his timing and sings in a pitch that does not scold when he turns it off before it can be dramatic. We do not set rules because neither of us wants to write a contract with loopholes; we practice courtesy like a second language and keep finding new verb tenses.\n\nAt work, I let my body do what it knows. The controlled drugs cabinet responds to the clink of key and habit. The printer, surprised by my good behaviour, only sulks once by mid-morning. Janet whispers to the red coat she has hung on her locker door, \u201cNot yet,\u201d and the coat, which does not have ears, somehow understands the thrill of being saved for an occasion. A man brings back an empty methadone bottle, washed and gleaming. He places it on the counter as reverently as if he is returning a library book he did not dog-ear. I reassure a woman that her son\u2019s rash is not the apocalypse, just laundry detergent with a personality. The day gusts around me and I am, for once, not blown entirely thin.\n\nGareth texts me a photograph of a plank of wood and the words Could use a second pair of hands, and I know this is an olive branch he cut himself and sanded until the grain felt honest. I go after my shift with my sleeves rolled and my jaw unclenched. In the front room he has taken down a shelf that suffered under too many ornaments and replaced it with one that believes in load-bearing. He hands me a level with the ceremony of an oath. We work side by side without staging a truce, because the truce has already happened somewhere quieter. He measures the space in that way men like him measure love: in exact tolerances that will allow a thing to live where it ought to live without falling.\n\n\u201cIs it you,\u201d he says, midway through making the pencil mark, as if we are discussing the length of a screw, not the shape of a life. He does not look at me, which is both mercy and torture.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, and the word is neither apology nor trumpet. \u201cIt is me.\u201d\n\nHe inhales like a man choosing clean air over smoke. \u201cRight,\u201d he says, and the syllable is a person learning to accept the chair he\u2019s been offered. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to ask if it was because I was afraid that it was and I would make an ugly shape out of that fear. I don\u2019t want to make anything ugly where there doesn\u2019t have to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to take something from you,\u201d I say, and I mean it in the complicated way. \u201cI am not a thief. I am not trying to be a replacement or an improvement. I am just\u2014I am someone he is, near.\u201d\n\nHe squints at the bubble in the level and waits for it to centre itself. \u201cI am not gracious yet,\u201d he says, honest to a fault that is already learning to be a quality. \u201cBut I am trying to be bigger than the bit of me that wants to slam doors. He deserves a person who isn\u2019t a hallway of shut things. You\u2019ve been good to him. I don\u2019t know what the right names are for us. But I\u2019m not going anywhere. And I will try not to be the man who makes every room into a contest.\u201d\n\nI put my hand on the wood, holding it steady as if steadiness is contagious. \u201cYou do not need to call me anything you can\u2019t say without chewing your tongue. We can be men who share a house where the knives go in the same drawer. We can give him a home he doesn\u2019t have to translate.\u201d\n\nMum brings tea in mugs that do not match and stands looking at her men and her shelf like a person who has been preparing for this domestic painting all her life without knowing what the colours would be. She kisses Gareth\u2019s hairline because he pretended not to need it. She squeezes my arm for a beat too long because she saw the way my shoulders sat. Later Kit arrives and the shelf holds a photograph of him at six, gap-toothed, a sticker on his jumper that says SUPER LISTENER, which makes all three of us laugh and then cough because truths arrive behind jokes like polite guests.\n\nThe next morning the pharmacy receives a surprise inspection, the kind of visit that makes even the responsible feel guilty by reflex. Two people in sensible shoes appear at ten-thirty with clipboards that have more confidence than some of the patients. We are a tidy ship most days; today we are a ship with laundry on the deck because I had just finished stock rotation and the counter looks like I am juggling antihistamines. Janet smooths her hair with the palm of her hand the way an actress prepares for a matinee, then steers the inspectors with that firm kindness of hers that implies the person being shepherded chose this path. I talk through the SOPs and the fridge temperatures, demonstrate the controlled register\u2019s exactness, and swallow the comment about the printer being our primary moral hazard. The younger inspector has the nervous energy of someone who has not yet realised they are allowed to smile; the older one takes her time, reads my counselling notes, and nods in a way that is not performative. When they ask about errors, I tell them the story of a near miss with a warfarin script from months ago, how we caught it, wrote it up, learned, bought a new highlighter not because highlighters save lives but because sometimes a tool is a reminder that you are paying attention. They leave with a decent report and a suggestion for my labelling; I breathe like a man who has put down a box he didn\u2019t realise he was carrying.\n\nAt lunch, Kit appears with a sandwich that has ambitions beyond itself and a grin that suggests he knows something he wants to spend all day telling me. \u201cI found a part for the amp that I thought was extinct,\u201d he says, biting into the bread like it offended him. \u201cAlso the man at the music shop told me about a gig this weekend. There\u2019s a pub on North Hill that lets you play a whole set if you promise not to scare the regulars. I promised nothing and he looked delighted. Will you come?\u201d He says it like a child asks, not because he expects yes as a prize but because he wants to hear the sound of the word made specifically for him.\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d I say, and see the exact way his shoulders change altitude. He leans in without touching and the part of me that spent thirteen years pretending to be a chair remembers how to be a person who can lean back.\n\nJanet watches us like a woman who has correctly placed a key in the correct lock. \u201cIf there\u2019s an encore,\u201d she says later, wiping down the counter with her small, precise violence, \u201cmake sure he doesn\u2019t do the shouting kind of music. My eardrums were in the war.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were not,\u201d I say. \u201cThey saw the nineties from a safe distance and survived.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse,\u201d she says, and puts her red coat on as if the coat had been waiting for this line all its life. \u201cThey dated Malcolm.\u201d\n\nThe concert is on a Friday because the world likes to put declarations in front of weekends so they have somewhere to go. The pub smells like beer that has known better days and chips that wish to be taken more seriously. There is a back room that is really a front room with a pretend stage, and the amps hum like somebody\u2019s stomach, full of electricity and nerves. The crowd is a mixture of students who have not yet decided what kind of cool to be and people like me who have come to be told that noise can be arranged into balm. Janet arrives in her red coat with a man who is exactly Malcolm and also somehow less than the story I have been told, the way ex-husbands often are. He brings her a half pint with his body turned toward her like a plant to a window.\n\nKit tunes his guitar with that concentration that makes him difficult to interrupt without feeling sacrilegious. When he looks up and finds me he does not wave; he tips his chin in a way that makes me feel privately selected. The first song is one of those amiable numbers you can nod to without agreeing. The second slides itself under the bones behind my ears and catalogues something I didn\u2019t know I was missing. He sings the line about lighthouses that used to be elsewhere and a girl near me whispers, \u201cI love that,\u201d to her friend, and the friend says, \u201cYou loved the bit about custard, too,\u201d which tells me they are new to each other\u2019s data.\n\nBetween songs he tells a story about a fence with evenly spaced planks and counting himself not-lost. People laugh in the way they laugh when a sentence is both harmless and a set of directions. Toward the end he plays something that I recognise without having ever heard it; I figure this is what people mean when they say they know a person\u2019s voice. I keep my hands civilised and my face unremarkable because Gareth is here now, standing with a pint, watching in the way of a man who is measuring the size of his son\u2019s stage and finding he can live with it. When the last chord does the thing chords do where they linger like steam, there is applause even from the man at the bar who looked determined to hate everything; Kit looks at the room like he\u2019s just been offered a job he didn\u2019t apply for, then looks at me and for half a second we are in a different place entirely, one with fewer people and a cleaner floor.\n\nAfter, Janet threatens to steal the set list and I threaten to report her to the appropriate authorities. She puts her red coat on like she\u2019s putting a period at the end of a sentence and says to Malcolm, \u201cYou behaved,\u201d with affection that sounds like a reprimand because that is their dialect. Gareth claps Kit\u2019s shoulder instead of his back because he has learned that backs are fragile. Mum kisses Kit\u2019s cheeks like she is validating a parking ticket. When we walk home the pavements shine with the kind of municipal pride that comes from being rinsed with beer, and the city air tastes like a misremembered festival. In the doorway I breathe in the smell that is us now\u2014the soap we both like, the faint trace of coffee because I am inconsistent, the sharper metallic tiny ghost of guitar strings\u2014and Kit says, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this without sounding absurd but your face is a place to keep my voice when I\u2019m finished with it,\u201d and I laugh so he doesn\u2019t hear the noise my chest makes.\n\nIn the pharmacy the next day, a woman in her sixties who might have been a sprinter in a different life arrives shaking like her hands are a language, and asks in a small, vicious voice for something for her husband\u2019s chest tightness because he won\u2019t go to the doctor and because she thinks if she buys a bottle with a possible solution inside the day will understand that she is doing something. I take her into the consultation room with its tiny sink and its sternly encouraging posters and we sit in chairs that make adults into children, not because of size but because of the way silence in a small room asks for confession. I ask questions that aren\u2019t clever and she answers in a manner that suggests she believes in me enough to give me the words I need to make the right decision. We call 999 together and it is both dramatic and absolutely ordinary. When she leaves, following the paramedics in their green, she squeezes my wrist and says thank you in the way grateful people say it when they resent having to be grateful. I wash my hands as if the act can scrub fear out of skin. Janet stands in the doorway and says nothing, because she has learned the law of these moments is not to put them into a neat paragraph before they have become one.\n\nThat afternoon, a boy returns wearing the kind of jacket that thinks it is a personality. He stands at the back of the line and pretends to be texting with great intensity. When it is his turn he steps forward and says, without looking at me, \u201cSorry I was a knob last week. About the inhaler. I pretended I knew and I didn\u2019t. Can you show me again.\u201d I show him again, with the space in my voice that makes it sound like it\u2019s allowed to be new. When he gets it right he smiles at the counter like it accomplished something without him; I leave him with instructions and the kind of relief you don\u2019t get to write down.\n\nIn the evening, Kit and I make dinner that is really assembly, a collection of things that agree to be nearby. He chops onions like he is solving a puzzle. I stir like stirring is a philosophy. He tells me that his mother wants to visit and that there is part of him that goes eight years old at the thought; he does a Scottish accent so tender I want to protect his mouth from anything that will make it widen to protect himself. He says he might ring her on Sunday and I understand that I will pretend I am not listening when he does, and he understands that I will leave the room not because I mind but because privacy is a present.\n\nSunday morning arrives with light that seems more optimistic than the forecast. We clean the flat in a way that implies we are going to be audited by a friendly god. He phones his mother and paces, telling the story with omissions that are not deceitful so much as careful; I chop the tops off carrots very, very evenly because evenness feels like a blessing I can offer without being noticed. When he says, \u201cThere\u2019s someone,\u201d I hear the word come out like a coin sliding into the right slot, and when he says my name softly I go cold and then warm because their conversation is gentle and not all my business. He comes back into the kitchen with the face of a man who has found an old map in a drawer and says, \u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s never a surprise to a mother who paid attention,\u2019 and then she said, \u2018Is he kind,\u2019 and I said yes as if I could write it down in a test, and she said, \u2018Then we\u2019re all fine.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother is a good person,\u201d I say, and he smiles as if we have all just passed something we didn\u2019t know we were sitting.\n\nOn Monday, Janet returns from the concert with cheeks that neighboured flushed and a text message she refuses to show me. \u201cHe didn\u2019t embarrass himself,\u201d she says, trying on a sentence that fits better than she wants to admit. \u201cI wore the coat and I did not burst into flames. Progress for old people,\u201d she announces proudly, and then goes back to arguing with the till roll in a manner that makes the till roll reconsider its attitude.\n\nThere is a new pre-reg pharmacist assigned to us for three weeks, a tall woman named Neha who has a face that reads every label the world hands her. She stands in the dispensary with her notebook like a shield and asks good questions, like what do you write in the notes when the thing that happened was a feeling and not a number. I show her the art of eye contact with someone who is folding their prescription into a paper swan because their hands are arguing with their head. She tells me she only sleeps when she is too tired to fight sleep and I tell her I used to pretend that was a personality trait. She watches me with the methadone clients in that way of young practitioners, measuring where to put her kindness so it can\u2019t be stolen; I tell her the trick is to leave nothing lying around that you can\u2019t bear to lose and everything else inside your voice.\n\nThe following Thursday Gareth turns up at my flat with a tape measure and a bag from B&Q. He and Kit have developed a language that sits somewhere between stubborn and domestic. They spread paper on my table and draw a plan for a shelf that will fit the only wall that fits the only shelf, a sort of carpentry haiku. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got two pillows,\u201d Gareth says, all faux-casual, \u201cyou may as well have somewhere proper to put the books that keep choosing your floor,\u201d and I am grateful for the specific form his concession takes. We build in my living room with the authority of men who have decided that making is a form of apology, the good kind, the one that offers something other than a sentence. He teaches me the step between drill and screw that has eluded me for thirty years; I make tea and don\u2019t burn the biscuits; Kit holds wood in place like it\u2019s a promise that needs two pairs of hands to keep it steady while it dries. When we hang the finished thing, there is a moment where we all stand looking at it and pretend it changed the room more than it did. Maybe it did. Maybe a shelf is not just a shelf when it is also a declaration that we are learning to hold our weight with grace.\n\nWe are not immune from the ordinary ways the world trains you to be wary. On a Saturday just when the weather remembers it can be summer for ten minutes at a time, there is a shout outside the pharmacy that makes the square around my heart shrink. A man staggers in with a cut above his eyebrow that was obviously not made by negotiation, and I clean it while he confesses that pride is a bad paramedic. He smells like regret and cheap cider and he is so polite about bleeding on my floor that I forgive him before he asks. I do not ask him for his story because it would be a theft; I press the edges together and teach him how to hold himself still so the skin can decide to be on his side. When he leaves, the bell on the door does not ding because the door is already tired.\n\nThat evening Kit falls asleep on the sofa with his hand in a book as if he has reached into language and forgotten to withdraw. I lie on the rug and look at the new shelf which is still surprised to be here and think of the ways lives attach to walls. He wakes with a start that speaks of a dream he will not tell me; I have learned that dreams are rude gossip in daylight. He sits up, rubs his face, and says, \u201cDo you think you could love someone who keeps needing to leave the room,\u201d and I answer too fast, because I have been waiting for the question without admitting it.\n\n\u201cI am very good at standing in doorways,\u201d I say, to remind us both who I have already been. \u201cI will want to know which room, and why you are going, and whether you will be cold. But I am not afraid of thresholds. The only thing I ask is that you tell me which coat to have ready.\u201d\n\nHe searches my face for the caveat he suspects in every kindness and seems a little bewildered when he doesn\u2019t find it. \u201cI was afraid of asking because of the body that left first,\u201d he says, and then we are quiet because sometimes the right response is a hand being something you can sit your jaw against.\n\nIn the middle of the night I wake to the sound of rain trying to be interesting against the window. The city is a lullaby that doesn\u2019t believe in itself yet. I think about my father, who did not use doors to leave; he used time, which is a more brutal technique. I get up and go to the kitchen to drink water too quickly, the way a man does when his throat is a sudden stranger. Kit pads in, hair conducting, and leans on the counter in his boxer shorts like a still from an advertisement for survival. \u201cTell me a list,\u201d he says, without preface, because sometimes the lesson is that the body remembers a fix before you think of it. \u201cRead me something that knows how to be a line of text.\u201d\n\nI recite the contraindications for ibuprofen in the rhythm that worked on me when I was seven the night Mum left the telly on talking about wars. I do the precautions, too, and the bit about gastric irritation. He smiles against the rim of his glass like a spy with good news. \u201cYou have a beautiful cataloguing mind,\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cIt has shelves now,\u201d and he leans forward to kiss me like that is the only answer to that.\n\nWe drift into May and the city begins its annual argument with its own brightness. The Sound puts on its chrome suit when the sun performs for longer than it is paid to. The gulls become cockier and less employed. At the music shop they ask Kit if he can cover Saturdays and he says yes with the sort of optimism that assumes the calendar is a friend. He comes home smelling like wood and dust and someone else\u2019s worries left briefly in his hands. On a Wednesday we miss our walk down to the Barbican because the sky instructs us to watch television under a blanket, and we obey with all the zeal of men who have been outside enough to earn it. On a Friday a package arrives for him from Scotland that contains a scarf knitted in a cobalt that is possibly illegal; he hides his face in it like he is auditioning for a new identity and then declares himself unfit for the role because his eyes keep giving him away.\n\nWe make a silly plan to go to France on the ferry one day and not sleep because we don\u2019t deserve the soft bed of a cabin if we are not going to give the day our attention, and then we do what all couples do which is discuss snacks as if snacks are the content of love. In the pharmacy a woman brings me chocolates with a miniature thank-you card for saving her husband by ringing 999 and I say I didn\u2019t save him, the paramedics did, but I take the chocolates and I eat one with Janet in the back like we are schoolgirls, and we both make noises that would embarrass us if anyone else made them. Neha watches us with the tired disdain of youth and then later steals one and sends me an email titled Incident: lemon fondant.\n\nIn all of this, the line that was a hazard tape becomes a lane we walk. We discover the right temperature between us by accident and call it wisdom afterward. We find that we can argue about washing-up without faking a storm to make it feel like weather. We learn the flavour of silence that means I am thinking and the one that means I want you to ask. We test the edges of a kiss like a finger testing bath water. We keep not telling the world because the world does not need to be told, but we find ourselves sitting closer at Mum\u2019s and not flinching when our knees arrange themselves into evidence. Mum, for her part, posts a photograph on her private Facebook of the shelf with the caption Family are different shelves, which is her way of proving she can be subtle.\n\nOne afternoon, between prescription deliveries and the school run, a woman named Saffron, who collects her methadone with a politeness that once got her a job in a hotel lobby, doesn\u2019t come. At the end of the day she shuffles in with her apology visible as heel-worn shoes. She calls me \u201csir\u201d which she only does when she thinks she has done something punishable, and I act as if we are two people in line at a bakery waiting to decide on the same pastry. I step into the consultation room and let the door be kind. We do not talk about why she didn\u2019t; we talk about now. She drinks the dose like it is a debt being paid and then looks up at me like she might borrow something else, something I\u2019m not allowed to dispense. \u201cYou\u2019re alright,\u201d she says finally, which is the greatest compliment I receive all month, because it means that for a moment she is, too.\n\nThe day before the second gig at the pub, Kit looks up from cleaning his fretboard and says, very evenly, \u201cThe band\u2019s friend\u2014Matt\u2014called and said there\u2019s a possibility of a few dates in Bristol if we want them. Little ones. Pubs. Nothing that thinks of itself as a tour. I told him yes and also yes, and then I thought about what that means and I am on the floor of my brain making pros and cons piles from receipts.\u201d He puts the cloth down and gives me the honest face, the one that is better than handsome. \u201cDo you think you could love someone who leaves sometimes and comes back with other cities on his tongue and the kind of tired that makes him a man you do not like for an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to put someone to bed who has stepped outside of himself,\u201d I say, and taste the courage of it as it leaves my mouth. \u201cI know how to make tea like a sentence that ends in a full stop. I will miss you with an appetite that will make me clumsy. But I will also be the place where you don\u2019t have to narrate what you did to people who were not there. I won\u2019t applaud at the wrong moments. I\u2019ll just be here with the lamp and a soup that pretends to be a meal.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me with the gratitude of a man whose shoulders have been offered a chair. \u201cI will be stupid sometimes,\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cWe all are. That is the democratic promise,\u201d and then he smiles with his eyes first, which is my favourite kind.\n\nWe keep moving, careful and brave in small amounts that add up. The shelf does its work. The printer behaves. Janet wears the red coat to the supermarket and reports that two men her age looked at her with respect that did not feel like a burglary. Gareth installs a dimmer switch at Mum\u2019s and calls me because the wiring surprises him, and after he leaves she rings me to say, \u201cHe said thank you to the old house when he turned it back on,\u201d in a tone that makes me think love is a way of being pleased by the things no one else would think to applaud. On a Thursday in rain we take the long road along the Hoe and count the couples holding hands like we are anthropologists; Kit numbers the fence planks again and says the number out loud and laughs when it has not changed, as if consistency is now a joke between us.\n\nAnd on a night that leans towards summer, when the pub has less air than you\u2019d like and more hope than you expect, he plays a song I have not heard and I feel something settle in me that does not want to call itself a promise. The room is a room, and my life is a life, and there are a thousand small, interesting futures queued up like prescriptions behind a counter waiting to be counted and checked and handed over with the right words. He looks at me mid-line and the look is not a question or an answer but a place, and I go there without leaving my chair. The sea will keep doing what it does, the gulls will be wrong at dawn, the printer will choose violence on a Monday for no reason. And I will go on putting things in the right bottles and counting to the right numbers and standing in doorways for the people who need someone to watch them come back, a hand on the frame to mark the edge, a light on if they\u2019re late.",

The gulls are less indignant and more brazen, stealing soft rolls from tourists who have wandered into town believing bread can be protected by paper. The pharmacy is a degree too hot by nine and two degrees ridiculous by eleven, the little fan on the shelf performing nobility without effect; the printer, sensing it is too warm to be scolded, behaves like a child angel in a school play until I need it most. On Ebrington Street the buses pant and the bakery air is sugared and the day has the shiny film of a gloss paint that hasn\u2019t quite dried, and I move through it with my sleeves rolled and my patience intact in the shallow way you can see along with one eye closed.\n\nKit has taken to practicing with the solemnity of a man tuning a ship; he stands in the spare corner by the new shelf and coaxes in-between sounds out of strings, pulling the notes toward the thing they are becoming with a concentration you can\u2019t interrupt without feeling like a vandal. The Bristol calls he said might come have begun arriving like distant trains you can hear before you believe in them, and he answers them with the caution of a person measuring not the miles but the you that will be left for the journey back. He says they\u2019re small rooms, nights with names like Candle Factory and The Swan and a place above a Chinese takeaway that promises to be either romantic or a grease trap for noise, and when he says, \u201cIt\u2019s only three in a row,\u201d he says \u201conly\u201d the way people do when they have listened to their own heart beating faster than logic for a minute longer than is comfortable. Gareth gets out his calendar with rituals\u2014he is a man who believes in the authority of a square grid\u2014and asks for dates in the tone of a foreman who is trying not to say I will miss my worker and does not know the union representative is his own chest. At my flat we look at the bag that will be his touring bag, if three pubs make a tour, and we put in and take out items like we are building a suitcase that will contain the precise amount of hope required not to spoil.\n\nAt work the heat makes everyone\u2019s discomfort more honest and the aisles smell faintly of coconut because the seasonal endcap is full of bottles that are trying to convince the pale that they are the brown kind without going to Spain. A man with the exhausted aggression of someone at the exact intersection of hungover and under-slept leans on the counter and attempts to charm codeine out of me in the way a person tries to flirt with a lock when they have lost the key; he calls me \u201cmate\u201d and he calls me \u201cboss\u201d and then he calls me \u201csir\u201d like the word tastes interesting and none of the words are the one that persuades medicine to commit an act of mercy it is not designed for. I tell him about paracetamol and ibuprofen and cool cloths for temples and the way certain kinds of pain are asking to be witnessed not silenced, and he hates every sentence I say until he gets to the one where I tell him that his body is not punishing him for being alive; then for a second his shoulders unlearn their lesson about armour and he leaves with a bottle he does not want and a small, undeserved thank you in his throat. Neha watches this with the precise attention of a person adding a chapter to a manual that has only ever been written with graphite and smudged by too many hands; afterward she asks if there is a way to be kind without being taken, and I tell her there is only the long way, the one where you keep a list of what you are not willing to lose and measure your words against it.\n\nMum invents reasons for us to come to dinner that involve weather, which is her sneakiest tactic; \u201cIt\u2019s too hot to cook in a small kitchen; come and eat in my larger kitchen,\u201d she texts with a line of little suns and a watermelon that makes no sense and a sailor because she has found a new page of options. We say yes because we know the argument is won and because her mashed potato is a religion, and we sit at the table with ice in our glasses and our shins sticking accidentally to the chairs and talk Bristol without saying \u201capart,\u201d which is the only word you can hear if you are a coward, and I am trying not to be. Mum offers to pack sandwiches for the train the way she used to pack sandwiches for school trips, and I say we are grown and she makes a face at me that says sandwiches cannot tell the time and do not care how old you are. Gareth, brave in small increments, asks Kit if he has a spare set of strings and then adds, as if he is emerging into a light he did not expect to be warm, \u201cDo you want the car for one of them, I could drive and make a fool of myself at a service station,\u201d and Kit looks at him with that sideways gratitude that is private even when it happens in a room with company.\n\nWe go to Bristol for the first of the little dates on a Saturday that has decided to shimmer and we do not argue with the weather; the train is two carriages and a memory of other trains, and we sit on the left so the sea shows its side sooner, a little flash of light like a promise being irresponsible. Kit has brought a notebook that contains more drawings of squares than words, floor plans of rooms that do not yet exist with little Xs marked for where an amp might go and arrows indicating vantage points, and he shares them with an embarrassment that reads as pride because he is still learning that mapping is a form of bravery. Bristol is hot with itself, larger in the way a city gets when it is pleased to have people come into it for a reason that is not shopping, and the venue is exactly as he described, a room above a takeaway where the salt and vinegar have been replaced by reverb.\n\nHis bandmates are people who look like their instruments; there is Callum, lank and cheerful and a drummer when a drummer can be rustled up, and Tala, who plays bass like she is pouring concrete, firm and purposeful and interested most in buildings that stay standing. They hug Kit and then shake my hand with that calculation I know well\u2014the one where you figure out if a person is here to be permanent or to be polite\u2014and I smile in the expression I developed for mothers of babies whose rashes might be nothing or might be something more expensive. They like me fine, I think, because my job is to hold a bag and clap a sensible amount and to look at Kit like I am looking at the person on stage and not the person I am making tea for in the morning, which I do poorly. In a corner there is a man who, it turns out, used to be important to him for four months in a way so intense it bent the story, and when Kit says his name in that amicable shocked tone people use when ghosts have gotten bored with haunting and decided to shop for crisps in daylight, something sour rises in my throat and I tell it to sit down. We are all stupid with history and a room this small cannot accommodate multiple timelines without tripping over wires, so we negotiate the lanes with spare nods and jokes that know their duty and I stand on the side and watch a version of my person exist that does not require me, and I hope a form of adulthood grows more comfortable with repetition.\n\nThe show is good in the way that a thing becomes good when everyone in the room agrees to be brave for a song and then tomorrow can take care of itself. I am introduced as the friend from Plymouth with a job that makes me serious and I resist the urge to attach footnotes; it has been years since I was embarrassed by being the kind of person who knows where the plasters are, but old jokes about yourself have a way of putting on shoes quicker than you can outrun them. At the bar a woman with eyebrows like punctuation asks me how long we have been together and I say, an inch away from honesty, \u201cLong enough to know what we\u2019re like and short enough to still be surprised,\u201d and she nods like I\u2019ve either said something wise or nothing at all, which is an accurate summary of my sentences on most days.\n\nWe sleep on the floor of Callum\u2019s living room on a rug that has been shampooed more often than is healthy, under a window that refuses to remember how to close properly in summer. The night is a noise, of course, because Bristol likes to have proof that it went on doing city while you tried to rest, and we lie on our separate islands of blanket and say nothing because we are both for the moment exhausted in the way that has no poetry in it. In the morning he is a geometry of knees and elbows and there is toothpaste and then weak coffee and then a scramble back to the station, and I love him in those ugly, efficient minutes because he is a person who can make time run forward and not ask it to slow down to admire him. On the train I catalogue his neck in case of shortage later, and then I look out of the window and make a list of boats with names that would suit us if we ever turn into a thing that needs to be painted in cursive on a hull.\n\nBack in Plymouth the day bears itself as if we hadn\u2019t left, which is comforting and also the smallest joke at our expense. Saffron misses again and this time when she arrives the following day she has the look of a person who has been shouted at by a window and convinced herself there was a person on the other side; she apologises in the administrative diction she uses when being human is difficult and something official would be easier. We sit in the small room with its tiny sink and the single blue chair that never fits anyone\u2019s sense of their own height and I perform the act of telling someone the rules because the rules can hold you up if you relinquish the need for them to make sense. Neha watches as if she is building herself a future in which she is calm; later she tears one of the packets along the dotted line with a tenderness that makes me think she is ready for the part of this job that is not checklists.\n\nGareth rings on a weekday and asks if I can spare a couple of hours to help him put together a planter for Mum, which is code for I am trying to speak the language of gratitude but there is sawdust on my tongue. We measure and cut and he shows me how to look for the knot that will betray you, and I tell him about the patient who exists for me only as a pair of trembling hands and a sigh of relief, because those are the parts of my days that cannot safely be told with names. Under the pretence of discussing the correct depth for herbs, we speak of my father\u2014who is not my subject but who is a fact\u2014and Gareth says, in a tone that carries the awkwardness like a plank on his shoulder, \u201cDo you mind if I ever meet him, even a little, as the man you didn\u2019t have,\u201d and I say, after three breaths that feel like decisions, \u201cThere is no meeting him; he is an old absence. But I don\u2019t mind you building things that would have made him useful,\u201d and we both look at the planter like it\u2019s a stand-in and decide we can live with that kind of proxy.\n\nKit\u2019s mother comes down for a weekend when the sky has decided to be hospitable and brings with her a suitcase that has seen three more winters than she has and a laugh that makes you stand up straight for it. She has that Scottish kindness that slides in sideways so you can\u2019t argue with it and a salad fork in her handbag because \u201cyou can\u2019t trust other people\u2019s cutlery if there\u2019s beetroot,\u201d and Mum loves her immediately with the proprietary relief of a person whose son has brought home someone\u2019s mother who is more than a hat. She shakes my hand and then holds it for a second longer than is necessary which is enough to make me blush and also to know she is measuring my heat and my honesty, and she declares, after an hour in which she has seen us do nothing but disagree mildly about pegs, that I have a face that would have been a doctor in a small town where no one says doctor, they say call him, he\u2019ll know. She sits in my kitchen and says, to the room as much as to me, \u201cKind is not the same as soft, aye?\u201d and I say, \u201cI am getting the hang of that,\u201d and she nods with the satisfaction of a person watching a kettle click exactly when she wanted it to.\n\nThe world does not object to our little happinesses but it does not cushion them either. A boy I recognise from the Courage Kit era gets caught with a shrink-wrapped family-sized bottle of cough syrup down his trousers and two energy drinks tucked into his jacket at the exact angle that has been learned by practice, and he looks at me with the arrogance of someone who has borrowed a face for the day that can take a telling off. The security guard is theatrical and bored in alternating waves and would love to do a sprint down the street, but there are rules about drama and I invoke the one that says if you give a person a chair at the right moment they are statistically less likely to try to kick you. In the little room at the back he takes the syrup out of his waistband and looks at it with a mixture of contempt and need that makes me want to confiscate every story in his future where he believes humiliation is the price you pay for comfort, and I tell him in the language of the law about why this bottle is not an answer and in the language of my job about why it will feel like one for about an hour and a half. He is all shoulders and apology and he says \u201cman\u201d at the end of sentences until it loses its meaning, and when he leaves I am left with the shape of him, which is an ache I can label and not fill.\n\nWhen the night breaths are longer and the flat keeps its cool like a secret, we lie on our backs and do the thing human beings do where we imagine futures by naming them as if we are reporting on a person we are going to meet, not be. We do not put labels on us because our hands are very busy and because calling something a name has never once made it more true, only more administratively tidy, and anyway I have enough labels in my life that stick to plastic and tell me about expiry and dosage. When he says \u201cboyfriend\u201d he says it like he is trying to hear whether the room itself coughs politely to protest, and I do not laugh because people remember where laughter has been; I say \u201cif you say it, I won\u2019t correct you,\u201d and he says it again more quietly and finds that no one dies. We book the ferry for a date that is far enough away to be chosen and near enough to be real, and at work I tell Janet I am going to France for a night like a teenager whose permission has been grudging and am given a list of instructions that include \u201cdo not bring me back nougat unless it is the expensive kind\u201d and \u201cdo not leave him on the boat if he annoys you.\u201d\n\nOf course the electricity goes out at the pharmacy on a Tuesday at four, because that is the hour when a system knows it can ruin you with maximum efficiency and minimum time to respond. The lights die with the resigned sigh of a person who has seen worse and would prefer not to see anything at all, and the fridge alarms begin their polite screaming which is what happens when scientific instruments decide to tell you about physics as if it is your personal fault. Janet swears with the professionalism of a matador and we begin the choreography we practice exactly so we don\u2019t have to think when we are scared\u2014strip the fridge of the vaccines first, pack them into the cool boxes with the ice packs we keep like superstition, label, log the times, call the surgeries who will be impossible about it in twelve hours unless you tell them now, and push the till aside so we can get to the plugs and discover, as we always do, that power is not a moral as much as an appetite. The emergency lighting is more emergency than lighting, and Neha\u2019s face looks like a person being tested on something she didn\u2019t revise for but probably has a deep muscle memory of in her bones; we are two minutes into sweat and softly sarcastic grim determination when Kit appears in the doorway with a bag of ice because I texted him one word and he understood it required a material answer.\n\nHe does not try to be in charge because he is not an idiot and because he respects the idea of rooms where your authority is rented, not owed, but he knows how to put ice where it will make the right kind of difference and how to not ask questions until the hands have finished talking. Janet, who has never met a situation she could not narrate while fixing, says to him in passing \u201cyou are a useful coincidence,\u201d and he beams in a way that is exactly as smug as the moment deserves and then goes very calm again which is my favourite of his moods. The power returns after an hour because a man in a van with an opacity of accent made the grid remember its responsibilities, and we sit on the floor in the dispensary among the boxes with our backs against a cabinet that lives to be leaned on, and we eat the biscuits we keep for staff morale as if they are a delicacy for rescuers coming in from a storm.\n\nThere is a quality to seeing your person sit on your work floor and take instructions from the woman who trained you that is both a folding of the world and an expanse; I watch the edges of my life come into one square with an almost audible click and I am embarrassed by the swell of satisfaction it produces. We finish the incident write-up with the honesty that means we will not hate ourselves later and go home in a small, happy tired because nothing actually broke, and when he brushes his teeth he hums the electricity company\u2019s hold music under his breath because that was most of his hour and he is the kind of man who let it into him and then made it melodic accidentally.\n\nThe Bristol dates multiply the way plans do when you have proved you are a person who can do an evening without punishing a bar for inviting you to exist in it, and we begin negotiating the ordinary way couples do when work is a thing and love likes to pretend it is not booking time with your phone out. I say I can\u2019t make a Thursday because Mr. Sign-Off is doing his quarterly and the shop needs both our hands, and he says that\u2019s fine and then texts me a photograph of his set list with little notes in the margin that say \u201cremember to breathe\u201d and \u201cthis transition is a liar\u201d and my name in tiny letters by a song that is not about me except all songs are about the person you are trying to impress. He goes away and he comes back and he smells of other places and he falls onto the sofa and says \u201cI am the worst version of me for an hour\u201d and I say \u201cokay\u201d already boiling a kettle and he is indeed very quiet and steely for sixty minutes and then he is himself again and I love him for announcing the forecast.\n\nThe ferry day is an experiment in being awake for longer than is strictly healthy and believing in the romance of transport like we are teenagers again; we converse with the nap we refuse to take and sit on deck with our jackets done up to the last button as if this will persuade the wind that our relationship is sensible. In France we drink coffee that scolds us and walk along a street that thinks tartlets are the answer, and I am overcome briefly by the domesticity of buying toothpaste in a different language because it is not the kind of grand future I thought I needed to be a person; it is the one where you are in a shop and the person you kiss is at the end of the aisle with a basket and you say do we need anything else and the person says no, I think we have enough. Mum texts a photograph of the lavender and asks if French lavender is different and I tell her it is exactly the same and completely a lie, and she sends back a row of hearts that have learned to wear berets.\n\nBack at the pharmacy there is a run on hay fever tablets that suggests the entire city has decided to be allergic to itself, and I begin to be a man made of loratadine and advice about showers, and for three days the bell on the door does not stop being a dinner bell. Neha counsels a woman more gently than I would have managed five weeks ago, which is the kind of pride you don\u2019t get to put on a certificate, and Janet schedules her concert with Malcolm for a night when the weather promises not to ruin her hair entirely, which is the kind of bravery that should get medals. Gareth fits a new catch on Mum\u2019s back door which has been sulking since 1998 and Mum throws him a barbecue as compensation for the fact that he refuses financial reward when given sausages and declarations of valour.\n\nOn a Wednesday that feels like a Monday in a costume, a man I\u2019ve not seen before comes in with a prescription that looks like it has been folded and unfolded so many times it has inherited opinions. He calls me \u201cTobias\u201d from the little line on my badge no one ever notices and asks if I am old enough to remember a cabinet maker from Leeds with good jokes and a silly laugh, and I say no more slowly than I should because speed is a tell. He is not my father, because my father does not send heralds, and anyway serendipity is not a thing that happens to people who guard their doorframes like I do, but something in my back goes cold and then hot because the past has got off a bus in my postcode. He tells me a story about a workshop with dust in the air like religion and I nod in the way you nod when an anecdote is harmless and only dangerous to a very specific piece of you, and then he asks me to recommend something for the stiffness in his fingers because he has not been kind to them, and I give him the standard counsel because bodies are not required to collude with the stories we lay over them. When he leaves I stand for a second with my hand on the till as if I have to remember the method of counting, and then I go and tell Janet a joke about antihistamines because sometimes you get to decide which noise your mouth makes.\n\nThat evening, after a shift coiled with more memory than labour, we go to Mum\u2019s for a meal that is apparently salad but is in fact a thrilling parade of carbohydrates that have been lying to themselves, and Gareth gets up halfway through to fiddle with the radio because he does not like the presenter\u2019s face even on a platform that does not show faces. Kit\u2019s mother rings halfway through dessert, and he steps into the garden with the phone to his ear and that scarf looped even though it is warm because it is a talisman now, and I can hear, through the open back door, the tone of a woman who can thread any needle and the catch in her voice when he tells her about three Bristol nights that were not a shame. Mum pours me an extra splash of wine and says, \u201cWe are a picture, aren\u2019t we,\u201d which is her way of asking me if I can carry it for a minute while she sets down the bit of joy that is heavy if you hold it wrong.\n\nLater, fine-tuning the domestic act of letting someone else brush their teeth in your sink and not checking the mirror for your face behind theirs, I ask him if he would want me there for the last of the Bristol dates, the one at the little place by the river that refuses to admit it is beautiful, and he says, with that seriousness that is a relief with him, \u201cYes,\u201d and then he says, \u201cBut if you can\u2019t, I won\u2019t clean feelings with a knife,\u201d which is nonsense unless you have loved anyone while both having a job and a mother. I tell Janet in the morning that I need to leave early on Friday for a train and she says, \u201cYou will leave when the last person who needs your eyes has used them and not before,\u201d which sounds like a curse until she follows it with, \u201cI\u2019ll push the end of day,\u201d and then winks in a way that makes me think she has invented youth again for half an hour.\n\nAfter the gig by the river that uses fairy lights to make its old paint charming, we walk along a weir that sounds like it needs a better therapist and he holds my hand exactly like the sentence we have avoided admitting we can write, and a woman at a table says, \u201cYou look like the advert,\u201d and we do not ask what for. In the morning Bristol does its Sunday thing where it forgives you for being a person by presenting you with bread and a dog, and on the train home there is a child who is angrily in love with an orange and loses every argument with it in the most satisfying way. We step out into Plymouth air that smells like diesel and chips and the sound of gulls bargaining and it feels, as it always does, like stepping into a pair of old shoes that fit better than you think you deserve.\n\nWe do not keep the world out but we keep our room clean. There are new problems every week that masquerade as repeats\u2014the boy with the cough that is anger, the woman with the rash that is shame, the man with the blood pressure that is his childhood\u2014and we say the right combinations of words in the right tone and offer the right packets and swallow the wrong things that would like to come out of our mouths because the dignity of someone else\u2019s bad day is a protective cloak if you hold it out. At night we count fence planks when the wind thinks it has a better idea for us and we report back to each other with the number, still the number, and then we hold that repetition between us like the edges of a photograph. I have started to sleep with my hand under my pillow only because it makes it easier to find his in the grey morning when neither of us wants to admit we can be happy without looking suspicious; when he kisses me goodnight he sometimes murmurs a list of parts he has fixed that day and I sometimes murmur dosages in response and we both agree these are the spells at our disposal.\n\nOn a Thursday like any other and like most of them, a man in a hi-vis vest and a scraggle of a beard comes in with a letter from a cardiology clinic that looks exactly like a letter from a cardiology clinic until you see that the date is wrong by two weeks and the appointment is tomorrow and he has no idea how to get there. We draw him a map like a treasure and I write on the back of a till slip which bus and what time and where to stand, and he grazes my knuckles with his fingers when he takes the paper like he has remembered that you can be grateful and also furious about the administration of your body. He will get lost somewhere along the way because everyone does and somebody else will draw him another little map and he will tell them that the man at the chemist was kind and I will never know that I am a link in a chain that did not snap and that is the point and the grief sometimes, and then I will go back to the printer and beg it to remember its purpose.\n\nKit gets home late that night and he is tired in a new way, the one he warned me about, the one where being in a room full of bodies that ate what you gave them makes you simultaneously invincible and hollow; he puts his head in my lap and falls asleep so fast I am briefly offended on behalf of my lap for being so easy to trust. His hair smells like stages and I sit under him like a chair that has done its stretching and is ready for a night shift, and I watch the streetlight throw its careful golden net across the carpet I vacuumed properly that afternoon because some days you need an achievement without a contradictory footnote. In the morning I will make toast I cut diagonally, because we are that kind of clich\u00e9, and he will drink tea that scalds him and declare the burn his doing and not mine, and I will go to the shop and count and count and try not to forget to notice all the ordinary ways we are not losing.\n\nOn my way in I pass the charity shop and there our shirt is again, the one like my father would have worn if he had believed in shirts lasting through a week, white with tiny blue squares looking like the compromise between showing off and being invited back, and I go in this time and I buy it, because I decide that objects are allowed to be divorced from ghosts if you insist hard enough and wash them at a high temperature. Janet compliments me on my good taste exaggeratedly and then tells me to lift with my legs not my back because she is constitutionally unable to praise without adding an instruction, and I am so fond of her mad science of love that I have to go into the consultation room and sit down for a moment until it passes.\n\nBy the end of the month Plymouth has begun to smell like its summer self, a blend of tar and sugar and something green that insists it belongs, and we have a calendar less full of disasters than of groceries and trains that do, for now, arrive where they said they would. The printer chooses violence on a Monday for absolutely no reason, which is its right and ours to object to, and the gulls go on arguing their way into morning even when no one asked their opinion, and my mother announces that she has decided to grow tomatoes as if tomatoes have been waiting all this time for permission from her, and Gareth buys canes as if he trusts things to hold themselves up with the proper encouragement, which is a metaphor I am trying not to sit down in like a hot bath. We keep the light on if the other is late and we put the kettle on if the other is early and I am beginning to believe that love, or the thing we have that does not want to be argued with, is less the thunderclap and more the hand on the frame of the door, warm, available, steady, marking the edge of what is us without needing to close it.",

The pharmacy breathes out when the heat breaks; we prop the door open with the box of leaflets about travel vaccinations and the bell on the hinge misbehaves, ringing at the wrong moments, announcing customers who are still in the street and staying quiet for the ones who have already arrived. The printer decides the storm is not its fault for once and offers me labels that fit their bottles like apologies that landed in the right mailbox, and even Janet admits, grudgingly, that the air feels like it has left a bad marriage. On Ebrington Street a traffic cone rolls down the hill like a drunk pilgrim and a boy rides past on a bicycle holding an umbrella that is fighting him as if it would rather marry the wind, and the day becomes one of those wonky British days where everyone agrees to be mildly incompetent together and no one writes anyone up for it. Mum texts a photograph of her tomatoes with the caption Tell me they\u2019re proud of themselves and I reply with three medals and a dancing lady and a carrot, because if emojis are a literacy then I have achieved a qualification I did not apply for. At home, Kit stands in the corner by the shelf we made and tunes through rain, and the sound of his guitar in wet weather is different\u2014less sparkle, more intention\u2014and I sit on the rug and watch his hands as if the note I need is hiding in the tendons.\n\nNeha\u2019s last day arrives with that odd mixture of ceremony and haste that always attends endings in places that are built to look like they are eternal. She brings in a box of doughnuts with the tragically kind optimism of a person who believes sugar will disguise goodbye, and Janet gives a speech without standing on anything, which is how you can tell she is sincere. I tell Neha the three things I am allowed to tell people who are about to become responsible for entire days without someone older to hide behind: write it down for the person you will be in a week, speak the truth if you can, and if you can\u2019t speak the truth speak slowly; pretend you are not the most important part of the room even when you are; and never, ever let the printer train you into despair. She laughs at the last one and tears up at the first two and gives me a pen that is heavier than you think it will be in your fingers, engraved with my name as if to remind me that the person I\u2019m being at the counter has a version of me that exists in rooms with no medication in them. When she leaves she hugs Janet like a niece and me like a colleague and says, softly, \u201cYou made it look like doing the job is the point,\u201d which is the nicest insult I\u2019ve ever received.\n\nThe Bristol train timetable becomes our second calendar, and the gigs accumulate the way freckles do on pale skin that has not been warned thoroughly enough about the day. There is a place called The Swan that is not a swan but is a room that knows what to do with a Friday, and an upstairs above a caf\u00e9 that insists its coffee machine must serve as backing vocal, and a courtyard show that is cancelled because the sound man declares he is allergic to rain and there is only one umbrella. Kit begins to call his bag The Bag like it is a character who is capable of passing judgments on whether you have packed enough socks to deserve success, and I write his train times on a sticky note on the fridge as if this administrative act will constitute insurance against all mischief on the rails. We learn the tone of text messages that mean exhausted and the ones that mean elated and the exact pause before a call that means a night was not a disaster but wishes to be forgiven for not being a triumph. He tells me about a man in a hat who cried during a song about a woman who never slept at the right times and I tell him about a woman who arrived with a UTI and the rage of a person who believes bodies ought to be more obedient than people, and together these stories make up a life that does not require applause to be real.\n\nThe letter arrives on a Wednesday that is only trying to be a Wednesday and fails by a degree. It is not dramatic, this letter; it is the kind of envelope that insurance companies favour, pale and impersonal, and it sits on my doormat with a humility I do not trust. The name on the back in the top left corner, tiny and old-fashioned, is my father\u2019s, which is ridiculous because men like him do not write return addresses, they leave forwarding feelings. I put it on the table and put a cup on top of it as if it might try to leave, and I make tea like a man who believes boiling water is a strategy. When I open it the paper smells faintly of his workshop from thirty years ago, sawdust and varnish and a small, accidental sweetness, as if wood shavings have a memory of being a tree that they cannot help but carry into the room. The words are ordinary as a recipe and new as pain; there is something about Leeds that is different now, a mention of a new hip that has been installed like a piece of hardware an apprentice could be proud of, and then a sentence that is both humblebrag and apology: I was in Plymouth for a job last month and stood at the top of your street and wasn\u2019t brave. He asks whether I would meet him for a tea, in the sort of caf\u00e9 where the milk is in a jug and the spoons have survived a hundred hands; he says he understands if I ignore this. He uses my full name the way you put down a tool you haven\u2019t handled in years and hope it still fits.\n\nWith the letter in my pocket I go to work and behave like a person who has not had a small bomb go off behind his ribs, and that is the skill I have been paid for my whole life. Janet watches me like she is weighing flour and when, at four, I say, as if it is a story I read about someone else, \u201cHe wrote,\u201d she does not pretend not to know who he is, and she does not say \u201cabout time,\u201d and she does not tell me which part of me ought to be generous and which part can be mean. She makes a cup of tea with a seriousness that should be reserved for diplomacy and leans her hip against the counter and says, \u201cYou are allowed to choose the weather,\u201d and then she goes and argues with a delivery driver who is trying to dump a box of sharps in the doorway and leave. At home, Kit finds me sitting at the table with the letter under the pen Neha gave me as if I am trying to sandwich a past with a present so it can be eaten without choking, and he reads my face without trespassing on the words and says, \u201cDo you want me to hate him or would you prefer I adopt him?\u201d and I laugh in a way that is too loud for the flat and then too quiet for the feeling and we agree to be clever later.\n\nOn Thursday\u2014because of course it is a Thursday\u2014I meet him. The caf\u00e9 is one where tables like to pretend they are older than they are, and the waitress has the expression of a person who is both kind by default and trained by experience to be careful with men who sit alone with paper napkins folded too neatly. He is early, which is exactly the cowardly thing to be, and he stands to greet me as if standing will make him taller than time. He is thinner around the eyes than he used to be, and his hands look like the same tools used more gently; there is a softness to him that is not softness but a reduction in edges, and he fumbles with his cup like a schoolboy who has been given responsibility for carrying soup. He tells me he has been sober for five years and looks at me like I am supposed to applaud that in public, and I shrug because the only people who are allowed to be proud in rooms like this are women who finally took their husbands\u2019 names off the bills, and he does not deserve me to be the person who celebrates him at that decibel. He talks about cabinets and contracts as if they are bridges, and then he admits, with the bravery of a thief putting a stolen watch back on a dressing table, that he would like to meet me where I am now and not where I was then. I do not promise him anything he can use to build a chair out of; I tell him that I am seeing someone whose guitar makes sense out of rooms and that my mother is a kind empire and that I count pill packets and floors with equal devotion and that I am too old to audition for his idea of me. We part like men who have both held their breath and performed the trick of breathing anyway, and in the street I stand for a moment and let the city arrange itself around the new fact of that goodbye disguised as hello.\n\nThe next week the pharmacy is loud in the afternoon in the particular manner of a place that trades in tiny solutions and larger consolations. A man comes in bleeding in the unimportant way that sometimes stands in for an emergency, a cut above his eye that looks like a punctuation mark which has decided to be dramatic; I clean it with my starting-a-prayer voice and he tells me he walked into a shelf at work and I do not ask whether the shelf was the thing he meant to collide with. A woman demands antibiotics by repeating the word as if repetition is an incantation, and I explain yet again that the potion she wants is a castle with a drawbridge, not a bottle she can shake when the door doesn\u2019t open, and eventually she buys throat lozenges and a magazine with an aggressive cover about summer. Around five, when the day is already half packed to leave, a boy we have not seen in a while arrives with Saffron leaning on him like a decision she regrets; her eyes are too shiny for this much daylight and her mouth is fighting two sets of words, and my first idiotic act is to put out my hand as if I can be a bannister she can grip while she ascends into usefulness. We make the consultation room do its modest trick of making a person smaller until they can fit their life back into their body, and she looks at the sink like it has a diploma and tells me she is fine and then that she is not and then that she is fine again, and the boy says he found her near the bins behind the Co-op and thought of me because I \u201cdo the thing where you don\u2019t make people feel stupid,\u201d which is possibly the kindest description of my job I have ever heard. We ring 999 with the casual heroism that Britain has made of phoning strangers to say a body needs help, and while we wait I sit on the vinyl chair opposite her and count my own breath like a fence plank.\n\nAfter, when the paramedics have come and gone with their green efficiency and their gentle lies about how everyone is alright when you have remembered to ask for help, I wash my hands as if I could polish away the memory of the way she said \u201csorry\u201d to the air for taking up space, and Janet stands in the doorway like a lamppost that has decided to be alive for a minute and says, without any flourishes, \u201cI know you think you did a poor imitation of God. You did your job. That is harder.\u201d At home, Kit listens with a steady face and pours tea into my cup in increments as if he knows the exact rate I can accept comfort without rejecting it on principle, and when I run out of words he does not fix anything, he sits on the floor with his back against my legs and names the plugs \u201ctwo-eyed sockets\u201d in a silly voice until I laugh against my will and then on purpose.\n\nAugust is not interested in balance; it offers feast or famine and assumes you like surprises. The Bristol rooms add a last-minute date that requires Kit to go up and down in one afternoon like a piston, and I cannot be there because Mr. Sign-Off has discovered a new way to make the quarterly report my personality problem. We text like men who are being faithful to different gods for one day and decide not to punish each other for it, and when he gets home at one in the morning he wakes me up by bumping into the laundry basket and spends a whole minute apologising to a piece of plastic for hurting it before he realises he is apologising to me, and I laugh into the pillow and pull him down into the bed by the wrist like a fisherman who has decided compassion is a technique. He sleeps diagonally and I do not resent him because when you love someone you choose the shape of your complaint very precisely, like cutting sandwiches for a child who cannot eat anything that is not a triangle.\n\nMum\u2019s tomatoes become a hubris; she invites us to a tasting as if tomatoes are wine and she is a vineyard owner with an argument with God. Gareth constructs a trellis that is more architectural than horticultural, all exact right angles and the kind of generosity you can hang hope on, and he does not say aloud that he is profoundly charmed by the way my mother can summon a harvest from a window box and impatience. We eat cherry tomatoes off a plate like sweets and declare them brave, and Kit tells my mother that a song is like a tomato plant in that it requires restraint and she decides to love him more for being ridiculous. Later, in the kitchen where the glasses know where they live, she asks me how my father was with a quiet that is not despair, and I say he was a slow apology, and she puts her hand over mine as if grounding is a science and she is a practitioner and says, \u201cYou do not have to be benevolent to be free,\u201d which is not in any of the parenting books but should be.\n\nOne afternoon a boy comes in with a nosebleed that has terrified his sister into bossiness and we manage to make it stop by humble methods\u2014pressure, patience, the right angle at which to hold a head so dignity can survive\u2014and after he leaves with a tissue moustache and a new respect for the violence of his own face, a man at the back of the queue says, \u201cThat was well done,\u201d and looks at me like praise is a currency and I am devaluing it by not agreeing to take more. I think of my father, who did work that turned his hands into maps, and of Kit, whose hands are maps of a different country, and of my own hands, which have spent the day writing labels and touching boxes and becoming objects that people trust for two minutes at a time. At six, when I shut the till with the pride of a man who has told the cash what to be, I find a small envelope in the charity box by the door with Janet\u2019s name on it; she opens it with the suspicion of someone who has lived through the kind of kindness that expects payment later, and inside is a set of tickets to a concert she mentioned in May and refused to buy for herself because she said sitting down to listen to a man sing was an admission of mortality. There is a note that says You gave my daughter her inhaler when the doctor couldn\u2019t see us and I believed in the world for an hour, and Janet pretends not to cry by reorganising the plasters.\n\nWhen Kit\u2019s mother comes down a second time the air has decided to be softer and she wears a skirt that has been to weddings and funerals and knows how to be appropriate at both. We take her to the Hoe because love involves showing someone the place where your wind comes from, and she stands with her hands on the railings and says, \u201cYou keep the edge very well,\u201d and then she corrects herself and says, \u201cNo, you keep the edge kindly,\u201d and I decide my headstone will say the same. She asks questions that are prayers with better posture, and in the kitchen of my flat she tests a cup\u2019s weight in her hand and declares my mugs acceptable for serious conversation, and that evening we talk about Scotland and lighthouses and what it is to be the mother of a son who has decided to try and stay, and she tells me about the day Kit was so quiet she thought he had been kidnapped by his own mind and then sang to his cereal, and I tell her about counting doses with my heart in my throat so often it has learned to perch there like a bird and not make a fuss. She leaves on Sunday with a scarf around her throat like a diploma and tells me I have a good voice for worrying in, which is a very Scottish blessing.\n\nBy September the evenings arrive with purpose; they step into the room instead of sneaking. The band\u2019s Bristol run pauses before autumn can pretend it has no responsibility for the way noise behaves, and in the space where gigs aren\u2019t, the music shop becomes a place where guitars confess and Kit learns the gentle bullycraft of telling men to pick the instrument that will not make them ridiculous. At the pharmacy the flu jabs arrive like a convoy and we rearrange the back room to accommodate new rituals; I make a sign in my neatest handwriting because neatness at least is a virtue you can perform when everything else is guesswork, and the first day three people faint because bodies are dramatic when they feel safe. I phone my father to tell him I am not angry at him and listen to the static that follows like the noise of a body trying to learn to be something else, and then I tell him we will not do Christmas together and he says \u201cFair\u201d in a tone that thinks it is magnanimous, and I feel nothing that could be made into a poem and I count that as progress.\n\nOn a Thursday\u2014by now the clich\u00e9 is a tradition\u2014we go back to Smeaton\u2019s Tower because the light has found a new way to be itself, slant and gold and full of mercy for people who are only trying. We climb in the way of men who remember the steps in their legs and laugh at our own breath without shame, and at the top the city offers itself again in pieces, Navy and park and ferry and the suggestion of France. We stand a little too close in that way only we can tell is not an accident, and a child announces behind us that he can see his house and his mother says he definitely cannot, and I think that is all anyone is doing when they look at a view\u2014telling themselves that the life down there belongs to them if they choose it. Kit touches the glass with the back of his knuckles like a man checking the temperature of now, and he says, without looking at me because sometimes courage happens more easily if you address the horizon, \u201cI think I want to make a thing with you that has a name,\u201d and I say, after being very mature for five seconds, \u201cWhat kind of name,\u201d and he says, \u201cThe kind that isn't a label, the sort that you call out when you come home.\u201d\n\nWe argue for three days about whether we are arguing, which is the health of us, and then on Sunday morning he stands in the doorway of the kitchen with his hair in the early stages of a plan and his face set to brave, and he says, \u201cBoyfriend,\u201d like he is giving a password to a bouncer and hopes the club is worth it, and I say, \u201cYes,\u201d and the kettle boils with the force of an agreement. We tell Mum by not telling her and letting her notice, and she says \u201cFinally\u201d like a woman who has been waiting politely at a bus stop and does not begrudge the bus its schedule, and Gareth says \u201cRight,\u201d in an approving way that does not need to be clapped, and Kit\u2019s mother sends a text with a heart that has grown little legs and is walking on the spot, which we take to mean acceptance across borders.\n\nAt work, Janet declares that calling Malcolm her man would be an unkindness to both of them and that they have agreed to be each other\u2019s person for specific events and not for Tuesday mornings, and I tell her that sounds like a peace treaty drafted by professionals and she pats my cheek and says, \u201cI knew you\u2019d understand bureaucracy as romance.\u201d The printer returns to its original sin as the weather cools, and I give it a stern telling off that makes Neha\u2014back for a day to collect a signature and a certificate and a cup of tea in her honour\u2014laugh until she almost spills sugar down her cardigan, and then we get three flu jabbers in a row whose bravery is entirely a sound they make after the needle and not before.\n\nOne evening, after a day of weather that could not commit, I find a small package on the doormat with no return address. It is a packet of guitar strings and a note in my father\u2019s careful, schoolboy printing that says Thought of him and thought of you, and I put it on the shelf under my books because not everything needs to be either forgiven or thrown away; some things can be stored until they tell you what they are for. Kit plays a song that is not about forgiveness and not about rage and not about fathers and yet somehow about all three, and I sit on the floor with my back against the new shelf while he plays and I realise that a man can be exactly himself and still be more than the sum of his stubbornness and that perhaps is the only promise we are allowed to make.\n\nWhen the first proper storm of autumn comes in off the Sound it arrives like a authority figure tired of our frivolity. The gulls go from wrong to outraged, and rain slants like criticism and the sea hammers at the breakwater as if it has heard a rumour and is not happy with it. A boy comes in to buy candles because power has gone on Mount Street and he pronounces the word as if he has never bought a candle before and would like the shop to be warned, and a woman asks if hay fever can occur in October and we all agree that bodies can do what they like when given half a chance. At closing time I turn the sign around with a feeling that is less relief and more gratitude for having survived another day without dropping anything that cannot bounce, and when I step outside the wind rearranges my hair into a style I cannot defend and Kit is there under the awning in a coat that makes him look like he takes weather personally and he says, \u201cI counted them,\u201d and I say, \u201cFence planks,\u201d and he nods with an idiotic seriousness that I adore and we walk home into an evening that has just enough light left to pretend there are no consequences.\n\nWe move through the rooms like men who have decided to be deliberate, and we put the kettle on like a plan, and I take the shirt I bought from the charity shop out of the wardrobe and iron it because I have decided it is mine and because wearing it will be more useful than keeping it as an artefact of courage. We do not name the future because the future does not care about our labels, but we begin speaking to it in second person as if it might be listening. If love is a thing in this chapter it is the act of letting a person know where the pans are without performing a little drama, and remembering to take your keys when you leave so the person who loves you does not have to get up, and standing in the doorway with one hand on the frame while someone you care about checks the weather outside and then turns back in, and neither of you pretends the edge is anything but what makes the room.",

The gulls are still wrong, but their arguments carry less bravado and more complaint. The pharmacy smells like cardboard and hand gel and a faint citrus that is not a fruit so much as the idea of one; we have cleared a corner to make room for the flu clinic operation as if we are preparing to launch small boats. I print consent forms until the printer, scandalised at my competence, jams in solidarity with winter. Janet unfurls her sleeves, ties her hair back with a rubber band she swears is new, and says, \u201cWe will put needles into arms with compassion and speed, like two nurses who got lost in the wrong play,\u201d and we do, because theatre has nothing on the choreography of two people who have worked together long enough to recognise the noises each other\u2019s shoes make.\n\nKit has a new sound when he practices, a stitch between notes that wasn\u2019t there before, a steadiness that does not so much announce itself as simply be. He stands by the shelf as if the shelf is a collaborator, and coaxes songs out of a Tuesday evening that behaved in the way of Tuesdays everywhere, which is to say obediently until five and then in revolt until bed. The Bristol rooms have paused while people forget they enjoy leaving their houses, and the music shop has become a place where he learns the geography of men who want a guitar because a poster told them they could be a better shape in a mirror. He comes home smelling like new strings and cardboard and dust that deserved better marketing, and when I ask how his day was he tells me stories that could be filed under anthropology: the way people cradle instruments as if they are babies they have invented for themselves; the way some men need permission not to be loud. We cook ordinary food with the satisfaction of men who have done their work and are now permitted to eat, and he sets the table as if the knife belongs to the right of the plate because the right of the plate is where knives live when they get to pick.\n\nBonfire Night becomes a series of small bangs pretending to be opinions. We take Mum to the Hoe because she cannot be told that fireworks look better from television; she is a woman who continues to trust that carrots weep when you peel them if the day is sentimental, she cannot be persuaded that explosions have an order to keep. Gareth brings a thermos of hot chocolate so potent it might strip varnish, and a bag of marshmallows he swears he bought for someone else. The crowd behaves in the city way\u2014strangers agreeing to be near each other and not making a fuss. When the first volley goes up, a toddler near us takes offence on principle; her mother negotiates with the sky as if the clouds might tone it down. Kit stands with his hands in his coat pockets and watches the streaks of colour draw lines against the dark; he leans into me by a degree only we would measure. \u201cIt feels like being inside a drum,\u201d he says, and I say, \u201cWe can leave if you want,\u201d which is the kindest offer I know how to make. He shakes his head and smiles with that small, private bravery, and when a particularly enthusiastic bundle goes off he flinches and then laughs at himself immediately, and I wish for a minute that the human body could be reissued with a better startle reflex and then decide I like this one; it keeps us honest, the way weather does.\n\nMy father sends a postcard from Whitby that features a harbour and a gull pretending to be wholesome. The handwriting is smaller than mine, careful in a way that makes you persnickety about your own breath. He writes that he thought of Plymouth when the wind pushed him toward the edge and that his new hip is \u201csettling in like a lodger,\u201d and I look at the card like it has asked me to rate his metaphors and find them acceptable. I slide it under the bowl we keep keys in, which feels like hiding and also like arranging. I tell Kit because secrets taught to me by boys do not belong here, and he listens with that stillness that makes the air organise itself, and he says, \u201cIf we meet him again, I will wear my kind face,\u201d and I laugh and say, \u201cIt\u2019s the only one you brought,\u201d and we both enjoy being men who can afford a joke in the vicinity of something serious without spoiling it.\n\nIn the pharmacy the flu clinic ushers in fainting as an amateur sport. Two teenage boys attempt to out-brave each other to the point that both end up on the floor, performed with the disgust of people who have been betrayed by circulation; Janet resurrects them with water and a tone that would make a general square his shoulders. A woman with three grandchildren admires our efficiency and then begins to cry because nobody told her how good it would feel to have done this thing, and I pretend to wipe down the chair for an extra second so she can borrow my silence without eye contact. The methadone clients fold themselves into the back room with the weary elegance of people who have learned to survive bureaucracy, and Saffron arrives on time twice, late once, and then one day early by accident; she looks at the calendar like a traitor and says, \u201cI can be wrong and still be alright,\u201d which sounds like a line from a play I would pay to see. I give her her dose and the glass of water and she sits for a minute because the chair is a chair and world history has not made enough of chairs that let bodies remember they belong.\n\nJanet discovers the Exeter museum has a lacquered cabinet the exact age of Malcolm and insists on visiting it as research; she returns with a brochure and an opinion about a man in the gift shop that could make a stand-up comedian redundant for a week. She speaks about Malcolm in the language of logistics and delight and refuses to call him anything a novelist would like. \u201cHe is a specific companionship,\u201d she says, at the end of a long day when we have both spoken politely to five people who did not deserve politeness and are proud of ourselves anyway. \u201cIf I start calling him names that require a haircut, I will have to be a woman who can be unhappy on a schedule.\u201d I tell her the world has enough scheduled unhappiness and she says, \u201cExactly,\u201d and buys herself a lilac nail varnish from the aisle with the firm air of a woman who is no longer asking permission from her own hands.\n\nMid-month, Mum overdoes life by an inch and tips herself into a faint like she is illustrating a point in a nineteenth-century novel. She\u2019s in her kitchen, of course, because the kitchen is where she assembles family out of vegetables whether they like it or not; Gareth calls me with a voice that has had its volume knob turned to \u201csteady\u201d by will. I arrive before the kettle finishes disapproving of someone using it in a crisis, and Mum is on the floor with a tea towel behind her head and an embarrassed smile trying to win an argument with pallor. We do all the ordinary extraordinary things\u2014glucose, a small scolding about breakfast, pulse and pupils and the good sense to sit still when you want to demonstrate that nothing ever happens to you. A&E at eleven in the morning is a parade of stubborn fragility, and we queue with dignity and a sandwich I bully her into eating and a joke she keeps forgetting the punchline to. The tests say this is a body under-charmed by salt and overconfident about standing, and she is released back to us with instructions about water and caution delivered in the tone you use for people you want to frighten into taking care. Gareth, who has been convincing furniture to forgive him for his posture for two hours, cries in the car in the exact manner of a man who refuses to be dramatic and loses, and I put my hand on his shoulder and press once like a doorbell. We get Mum home and settle her on the sofa and she announces she is bored and I could not be more delighted by her boredom if it had sprouted medals. For the next week she eats with the determination of a woman training for a marathon in a sport called staying, and Gareth brings her soups with names that are him trying to be clever and her deciding to let him.\n\nThat evening I ring my father from the low chair beside the new shelf and he answers like people answer when they have been waiting and are pretending not to. I tell him in plain words about Mum and about hospitals and about tea towels, and he does not ask if he can visit because he is not a fool and because the decade between us looms like architecture. He says he is sorry and means it, which is a revolution too late to parade, and he says he will not intrude, and I say, because the adult in me is tired and the child in me is a small man with a tiny hammer, \u201cYou can meet me again, by the sea, when you like,\u201d and he says he will try. I tell Kit I have reopened a door and he does not ask if I am certain of the weather; he trusts me to know which coat to bring. We go to the Hoe and look at the water like it has kept secrets for us, which it has.\n\nRain on glass becomes more interesting in November, which is not something you can prove but is true. We manage three walks in a week that feel like reasons and one walk that feels like punishment, and on the punishing one Kit counts fence planks aloud just to prove that certainty continues to be an option. He says, with frost in his breath like a thought escaping, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m scared of leaving anymore. I think I\u2019m scared of coming back and finding I haven\u2019t been missed,\u201d and I say, \u201cMy house does not know how to forget your shoes,\u201d and he nods as if I have given him a glue stronger than words. The band record in a practice room that smells like student and ambition and everybody\u2019s shampoo, and he brings home a flash drive like a lozenge that might cure regret. We listen on the sofa with our knees nearly touching and he does the thing where he pretends not to watch my face and fails; the songs have become rooms and he has taught them how to let people in and out, and I am proud in the quiet way that makes your chest become a terrace.\n\nAt the pharmacy there is a run on cough syrup that would make a person cynical if one were not already trained in the art of sighing correctly. A man attempts to purchase the entire shelf with the apology face of a person who has been assured by a friend called Darren that it takes two bottles to achieve a kind of lucid transcendence; I sell him none of it and three boxes of tissues and an adult conversation about all the things cough syrup is not supposed to do. A woman arrives with a bag full of supplements and the hopeful aggression of someone who discovered the internet and believes it owes her a degree; I talk her down from the edge of evening primrose oil by invoking the magic spell of placebo in a tone that respects it. Janet develops a cough that sounds like a dog at a gate and refuses to go home because she is the kind of woman who would deliver a baby at the till rather than disrupt the teamwork; I remind her that martyrdom is an unattractive hair accessory and send her to sit down with a decoction of lemon and bossing. She texts me from the staff room a photograph of her red coat draped over a chair and the caption \u201con strike\u201d and I almost drop a box of loratadine laughing.\n\nDecember arrives with the soft boots of a man who knows he\u2019s late and hopes his charm will carry him. The lights go up on the Barbican\u2014the kind of small, honest lights that make you believe in people who climb ladders thoughtfully\u2014and we go down to look at them as if fairy lights were evidence for something. We decide to do Christmas uneventfully on purpose; Mum refuses to hear \u201csmall\u201d as anything other than a challenge and begins cooking lists in a notebook she keeps by the kettle. Gareth buys too much foil and a meat thermometer that behaves like a person with a public persona, and Kit brings home a tiny rosemary bush that smells like a spell. At my flat we buy a string of lights that agrees to behave like stars if asked nicely, and he wraps them around the shelf and casts the new books in generous light as if he is staging them for a photograph neither of us has the energy to take. We keep the gifts modest because we are trying to outgrow the childhood instinct to equate surprise with love, and on the morning itself he hands me a small box that contains a label maker with a face so serious I laugh out loud; he says, \u201cI will never be allowed to mock you for labelling the sugar again,\u201d and I give him a set of screwdrivers for tiny screws and a packet of picks in three tones of blue and the privilege of laughing at himself when he attempts to assemble the stand for his amp and undone it twice. Mum gives me a jumper that believes in my shoulders and I wear it with the gratitude of a man who has had his shape affirmed; Gareth grills brussels sprouts like he is entering a competition and they survive.\n\nMy father sends a card with a lighthouse on it that is not ours but is trying, and inside he writes, \u201cI am proud of you in the way a man can be when he has not earned a chair,\u201d and I do not cry because the onion I cut for the gravy already made me do that yesterday. I put the card on the shelf and when Kit sees it he touches my hand the way you press a paper flat when you are about to write something important on it. Later, after the plates have been cleared and the radio has been turned down to the level that demands intimacy, Mum tells a story about me at five making a potion out of glitter and washing-up liquid that turned the entire sink into a bubble sculpture, and I blush at the old embarrassment like it is a friendly ghost. We go home under a sky that has chosen to be a proper dark, and Kit steals me under the fairy lights and kisses me with the patience of someone who can see the edge and intends to stand there with both feet and still be relaxed, and I think, not for the first time, that the body can be taught better manners by other people\u2019s gentleness.\n\nBetween Christmas and New Year, the pharmacy becomes a haven for the hungover and the resolute. Men arrive with diets in their eyes and women arrive with gym suggestions in their hands and I sell them vitamins because it makes us all feel purposeful and will not make anything worse. A boy I recognise from spring comes in to thank me for not selling him something he wanted then; he has a new jacket and the kind of eyes that have been told the truth recently and didn\u2019t like it and made peace anyway. He buys plasters to go with his new shoes and flirts with the scanner like it is going to make him into a barcode that signifies a better price, and I let him because sometimes the job is to be the adult who doesn\u2019t pop somebody\u2019s balloon.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve we do not go to a party because the people we used to be are men who feel guilty in kitchens they can\u2019t clean. We go to the Hoe because the wind wants company and stand by the fence with the planks and count them because we are committed to the bit, and at midnight a handful of fireworks admit themselves over the water and the ferry to France blows its horn like a man with a romantic problem, and Kit kisses the corner of my mouth as if he has learned cartography and is checking the legend. We go home and nearly fall asleep while the kettle boils because this is adulthood and we are so good at it we have become boring, and I have never been more pleased to be dull in my life. In bed, the window rattles in its frame because the glass would like to be a song and is not, and we lie on our backs and list the unbeautiful goals we have for the year\u2014fix the dripping tap, get the chair leg looked at, soften around the parts of ourselves that are cruel to us\u2014and fall asleep mid-sentence because we are not men who complete all the things we start, which makes us exactly like everyone else.\n\nJanuary is a government form. It asks you to declare things you would prefer not to; it requires dates and tolerances and a promise to be on time. The pharmacy settles into that stubborn rhythm where the rain measures out the day by insisting on being renamed. We begin the dance of stock and need that feels like writing a novel in bottles without a plot. A man brings in a New Year\u2019s resolution disguised as an asthma review and we discover he has been using his inhaler like a perfume; I teach him how to hold something that has a responsibility for him, and he leaves with a grin that tells me he has understood that breathing on purpose might be a revelation disguised as boredom. The printer behaves for nine consecutive days and I begin to suspect it has fallen in love with me; I refuse to engage because I know how this ends. Janet announces she is considering a weekend course in pottery and Malcolm, who has eaten enough cottage pie in her company to have opinions, says he will not come if they make him use a wheel, which is a sentence I did not foresee being relevant to my life.\n\nKit is offered a small managerial role at the shop\u2014three days a week organising the world so other people can think they are creative without being interrupted by the need to find a cable. He accepts with the gravity of a man committing to keep receipts for emotions, and we celebrate with a cake bought from a baker who uses the knife like a conductor. He stands in the kitchen with the cake fork and says, \u201cI used to think being in charge was the same as being guilty,\u201d and I say, \u201cIt can be if you are a man, but it is also the business of being spared worse men,\u201d and he nods as if his hands have just learned something and will tell his mouth later. The band asks whether he can record an EP in a friend\u2019s studio that is really a garage with better acoustics, and he says yes in the tone of someone who is prepared to fail in public; we buy him a notebook that will become religion and he fills the first page with rectangles and the names of songs that are not yet sure of themselves.\n\nMy father manages his promise in February with the caution of a man moving furniture around in a room where he is a guest. He asks if we can meet at the snack van that pretends to be a caf\u00e9 near the ferry because he has decided the sea can vouch for both of us. We stand with our paper cups and talk about nothing and then about wood; I ask him if he remembers a cabinet he made where the drawer stuck because he loved the wood too much to sand it and he laughs like a door refusing to open and says, \u201cI learnt,\u201d and I say, \u201cMe too.\u201d He brings a photograph of me at two that I do not own, me in dungarees that suggest a child who would like to borrow a hammer, and he places it in my hand as if returning a library book and we both stand there like men who have felt their ages queue up behind them in neat rows and are acting as door staff. I do not tell him about the first time I fell in love because that is not his to hold; I tell him that I count fence planks in the wind and it sounds ridiculous and feels correct, and he nods as if he would like to be able to do a ridiculous thing and not be observed doing it. We agree to be men who can say hello without interrogating the definition, and on the walk home I count streetlights just to make a mockery of consistency.\n\nLate winter ruins someone\u2019s toe on the wet tiles in the pharmacy and I learn again the specific way a body throws a complaint into the world with noise and blood and a degraded dignity that has to be returned with interest by someone else. I use my consultation voice and the plasters that never stick and the call to 111 that is a ritual if you do it in the exact order; after the ambulance has come, the rest of the day shrinks as it always does and refuses to carry its own weight and I am full of a rage that is useless and noble and knows better. Janet says, \u201cDon\u2019t take it home,\u201d but she says it with a fondness that makes me want to the way a teenager wants to do exactly the wrong thing when told not to. I don\u2019t, though. I go home and tell Kit a version of the story that is good for dinner, and when I run out of civility I put my head on his knee as if sleep is a commodity he might loan me at a reasonable rate, and he plays a chord that feels like a hand on the frame.\n\nWhen spring tries its first trick we are ready to be fooled. Mum\u2019s tomatoes have become an anecdote; she reads seed packets like they contain prophecies and Gareth pretends to disagree with the instructions purely to be given new ones. The city smells like it forgives you if you apologise properly, and the light comes back as if it never left and expects a medal. On a Thursday we go to Smeaton\u2019s Tower again and the view, which has done nothing to earn our gratitude except exist, earns it. Kit puts his palms on the glass and counts the smudges someone forgot to wipe last week as if someone else\u2019s fingerprints indicate our right to be here. He says, \u201cI want to call you something soft when we\u2019re tired and rude when we\u2019re late and honest when we are stuck, and I think boyfriend does most of the job but it feels like a jumper you stop noticing except when it\u2019s missing,\u201d and I say, \u201cThen keep it warm, and if it frays we\u2019ll learn to darn,\u201d and he laughs and later calls me sweet man with such lack of irony I have to sit down.\n\nWe begin making plans that do not apologise for themselves. A trip to Leeds to look at a workshop that is no longer my father\u2019s but maybe is a geography I am entitled to walk around in; a weekend on Dartmoor where the wind is not a metaphor but a person you have to negotiate with; the idea of a song that belongs to this room and nowhere else. We buy a plant that does not insist on being dramatic and put it on the shelf in the corner where light arrives as if dizzy, and we water it like a pact and call it a name and do not tell anyone because plants do not want to be on our social media.\n\nWork finds its monastic humility again, the counting, the checks, the rightness of aligned labels. A teenage girl learns to inject herself for the first time and swears with the elegance of a poet, and I admire her for cussing at fear and continuing. Saffron arrives one morning with a new coat that does not earn its beauty; she stands straighter than last month and tells me a joke so bad it requires a police escort, and I laugh and she says, \u201cI made it up so you would have to be kind,\u201d and we are allies for the length of a minute and then the day takes her somewhere else to be herself. Janet\u2019s pottery produces an object that knows what it is despite being beheaded three times; she brings it in and puts paper clips in it and calls it a success, and I print a tiny label for it that says JANET\u2019S GLORY BOWL and she shouts at me while smiling with her teeth.\n\nThe EP is recorded with the kind of concentration that robs you gently. Kit comes home smelling like effort and string polish and he collapses into domesticity the way some men collapse into armchairs; he eats toast like a profession and listens back with that honesty I admire and dread, the honesty that could possibly lead him away and might also lead him further in. One evening he plays me a track and afterwards he does not speak and I do not speak and a silence opens up that is not a warning, just a room; eventually he says, \u201cI think I made something I won\u2019t hate later,\u201d and I say, \u201cThat is the highest art,\u201d and he laughs and breaks the spell.\n\nAt the end of the month my father sends an email because he has learned the keyboard and is proud. He writes that he has been to a meeting where men appeared and talked about doing better without any women in the room, and asks me what the word \u201cperformative\u201d really means, and I send him three sentences that manage not to bite and include the word \u201cshelf\u201d as a metaphor and he writes back, \u201cRight,\u201d and then, \u201cI will build a better one.\u201d I show Kit and he kisses me on the temple as if that part of my head is a page and he has approved the edit. We get on with our evening and the printer gets on with its long-term project of teaching me humility and the kettle clicks and the shelf holds and the city breathes and the wind continues to be its very gem-like wrong, and I stand in the doorway between the kitchen and the sitting room with a hand on the frame and practice the art of marking the edge without needing to close it.",
