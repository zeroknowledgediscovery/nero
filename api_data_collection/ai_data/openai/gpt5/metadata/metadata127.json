     "novel_text": "It began with the cockerel that wasn\u2019t there.\n\nEwan Calder woke before dawn to a darkness as familiar as his own worn boots and lay still, counting the beats of his heart and the breath outside in the birches. The old cottage on Davah Court sighed like a sleeping dog, settling its beams. Somewhere toward the Don there was the tin-foil whisper of wind against hedges. Then a sound rose, a thread pulled through the cloth of night, and he had to clamp his breath like a lid. A scratch at the throat of the dark. A rung sliding along an iron rail. The start of a crow, perhaps, or only his remembering of what a crow sounded like.\n\nHe lay there until it faded, then slowly let his lungs work the air again. He shut his eyes, opened them. The ceiling beams were just darker under the dark. He whispered the spell, the one he always used when dread braided with dawn: a twisting of three names and a folded line of the Don\u2019s course. He could see the river even now, even here, as if he could tip the cottage and let the water wash through his rooms and clean him of thinking.\n\nNo rooster. There was no rooster near enough to see him, Ewan told himself. It had been months since the Knoxes had moved their birds further out after he\u2019d politely asked, standing at their gate with a Tupperware of oatcakes he didn\u2019t eat and a charm tucked under his tongue for courage. They'd laughed and said the \u201cloon\u201d from Davah was affy fond o\u2019 quiet mornings. He kept his voice steady then, didn\u2019t mention the way cockerels could freeze his magic like a frost goes through a glass of water. He had gone home with his empty tub and had not shaken until he shut the door.\n\nHe sat up. His fingers were inked with the grey smuts of protest he pretended was soot from the stove. To most of Inverurie he was the quiet one, the man who worked in the library two days a week and fixed clockwork the other days, right as rain. The modest broom cupboard in the back of the library which used to be a cloakroom was his, and from that small space he shepherded the town\u2019s modest flows\u2014old book smell, light on polished tile, the sigh of the automatic doors. Sometimes he touched the spines of the local history volumes and felt the weight of names that were not gone, not really, just living in the turns between page and page. Magic moves most easily where something is half one thing and half another. This he knew. The noon hour and midnight, the river bend at the Bass where Don and Ury for a moment do not know which way\u2019s east.\n\nHe swung his legs out of bed. On the table he had done his night\u2019s work, the beads and knots and two empty jam jars. He tightened the knots, thumbed the beads, and muttered another little set, more habit than need. The cottage tried very hard to be ordinary for him. He had painted the kitchen a municipal cream. There were postcards of Glasgow and Lerwick on the fridge with magnets shaped like carrots. In a drawer, three pieces of meteorite hidden among teaspoons. On the sill, six pebbles that looked like nothing much under their skin but, if you turned them under a certain light, would show you the underside of the morning.\n\n\u201cBide, then,\u201d he said to the room. He had never liked people who spoke to houses, but his cottage was older than anyone in his life; it seemed churlish not to greet it. He dressed, washed, and went out to the lane.\n\nHe always went to Bennachie with his tea. To look at it from Garioch Field, or from the little rise by the allotments, or from the corner where the Inverurie sign stood and someone always hung a football scarf. Bennachie had been there before he was, before his grandmother and her grandmother\u2019s headscarf. The hill was a baked loaf of stories everyone kept breaking bits off. This morning it sat with its shoulder hunched under a dull-red sky, waiting, as things that are stone wait: patient, watchful, sad and not sad.\n\nEwan sipped, standing in his coat, and felt the shape of his day lock into place. Monday: library. Archives first. The old woman with hands like paper, who liked to sit in the morning light by the window and not read. He would make sure the third light on the right worked; if the bulb flickered she got angry and it got through into the rest of him. Then the schoolboys, two of them, who came after classes to sit at the computers and swear softly at geometry. He could handle children, most days. They tended to accept magic without noticing it was magic, which was the best sort of acceptance. Adults had to put the acceptance somewhere, and where they put it was usually unkind.\n\nSomeone called, \u201cMornin, Ewan!\u201d and he turned.\n\nMoira Fraser from the bakery was walking her dog, who was so bad-tempered and small that Ewan never understood how a creature could hold that many contradictions. Moira waved with the hand not attached to the dog. \u201cYe were up early. Ye\u2019re like a crow yerself, aye? First light and away.\u201d\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Ewan said. His voice had a fixed shape he put it into when he went out. It set accordingly, like jelly in a mould. He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. And you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine enough.\u201d She stopped near him, tugged the lead to make the dog halt too. The dog did not halt. It quivered in place like a machine tries to hum loose. \u201cListen, ye work at t\u2019library, aye? We\u2019ve a lad from Hatton says the newspapers o\u2019 last year went walkabout. He\u2019s one for the births column. Can ye look?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll check.\u201d He would check anyway. The archives had a way of rearranging themselves around people\u2019s wanting. If someone desired, truly desired, to find the notice that confirmed a life begun, the folders loosed it like a hen letting a chick out. If someone wanted to confirm a death without wanting to feel anything about it, the papers hid what was needed among old recipes for stovies and parish notices from nineteen sixty-two.\n\nMoira shifted, then looked off, then back. \u201cYe heard o\u2019 the Bagman?\u201d\n\nEwan blinked, because he had a thought like two flints tapping. Then it was gone. \u201cThe what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bagman. A daft thing, it\u2019s just the bairns. They say there\u2019s a man collects a\u2019 the plastic in the town. Not ta collect like ta put in bins. Collect like\u2026 keep. They say he lives in th\u2019 auld garden centre down by Thainstone where it\u2019s shut, and the wind there makes a noise if ye stand and listen. A rustling. Like thousands o\u2019\u2014well, bags. They say he fills them with\u2026 something. It\u2019s just foolishness.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust foolishness,\u201d Ewan agreed. His mouth kept the same friendly line. But he felt the flint again; this time a small spark jumped from it and landed somewhere damp in him. His heart did its business. His tea steamed. The sky had started to thin. \u201cI\u2019ll look for your papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye. Thanks.\u201d She tugged again. \u201cCome on then, Morven, ye halfwit.\u201d The dog, who was named for a mountain and barely came up to Ewan\u2019s ankle, yapped without conviction and continued her important business of walking.\n\nEwan stood awhile longer and watched how the heather was darker on Bennachie\u2019s cuts. Plastic bags. There had been more. The town had never been clean\u2014no place is, not really\u2014but lately there were the white ghosts of supermarket carriers in every thorn bush. You\u2019d see them staked into the hedgerow like flags of surrender. On windy days, they\u2019d lift and snap. On still days they\u2019d droop. He had felt, the last weeks, that the wind had a note in it he didn't remember from winter. A rustle. A hiss. Like the ghost of rain.\n\nHe took the side path to the library because the main road went past the smallholding where there was a cockerel. It was not an old bird; its crown was bright and gay and too big for its narrow skull, and when it crowed something in Ewan ran to the edges and tried not to fly apart. It wasn't only the sound. Sound can be blocked. It was the shape of what the sound did in the air, a sort of hinge the crowing made and opened, and at that hinge point certain spells lost their grip. The first time he learned this was when he was ten and his grandmother let him try the water-bowl charm. You set a bowl in the yard, facing east. You fill it with water from a jar you filled from the river on a night when the moon was still a fingernail. You do not speak above a murmur. You breathe on the water, and you will see for three seconds a thing you will need to be shown. More than three seconds and you would be made ill for a day and unfit for any work. Ewan had done as he was told; the bowl had taken his breath in, and then, as if cued, the neighbour\u2019s rooster announced the morning. The bowl turned opaque. For a heartbeat he saw himself fall into it, nothing but falling, a lad with a fringe and no sense for balance. He couldn\u2019t look in water for a year without feeling he was going under, and he could not thread a charm for months because the crowing lived under his skin and drummed through the work like an impatient stranger. A therapy of sorts: his grandmother swatted him with a dishcloth and said he would be all right, and he was, except when he wasn\u2019t.\n\nAt the library he paused, fixed the third light. It winked and then shone. He said good morning to the others. He checked the box of bookmarks and slid a hand under its cardboard floor to touch the little charm stuck there like a playing card. He breathed, and the room breathed too.\n\nThe archive was colder than the rest of the building. The lamps fossilized the dust motes. He checked the local papers for Moira, and while he was reading the births list and finding wee ones named after saints and footballers, a line of type caught him: environmental complaint filed by the River Don Trust regarding increased non-biodegradable waste in the Ury tributary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everywhere,\u201d Mr. Graham said cheerfully from the doorway, startling him. Mr. Graham came to the library daily, mostly to talk. He dressed like an academic left out in the rain. \u201cPlastic, I mean. I found a Tesco bag in a gorse bush up by Oldmeldrum last week. Up near the top. How\u2019d it get there? Gorse doesn\u2019t shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWind,\u201d Ewan said.\n\n\u201cAye, but when did wind take to shopping at Tesco? Wind should be shopping at the co-op at least. Support local business.\u201d Mr. Graham smiled as if to excuse the world. \u201cYou look pale, lad.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly,\u201d Ewan said. He handed the man his reserved book. The title had a lot of words and the words were mostly longer than the man liked. He took it anyway, radiant with good intentions.\n\nWhen the morning had slid into the hour where the coffee smell is as much hope as drink, Ewan went to the back door to step out, and there, in the alley, a bag moved with no wind to move it. A thin, clear carrier of the kind you get at the veg stall. It lifted a corner. It folded like a bird, if a bird were ashamed of its spine. The alley smelled of bins. There was no other movement. The bag rustled to itself, a whispering from inside the plastic like a person under a blanket practicing their lines.\n\nHe looked at it long enough that someone coming with returns coughed to get by him. He made himself step off the threshold and pick up the bag. It did not fight him. It lay on his palm, even limp, as death looks, and he could have balled it and shoved it in his pocket and let it live under a chair forever. He did not. He laughed a little, because laughter is a charm if you do not mean it.\n\n\u201cBack ye go,\u201d he said. And he shook his hand the way his grandmother had taught him to shake nettle sting out of the skin. The bag shrank. It did not vanish\u2014he had no interest in vanishing anything that looked like that; vanishing is not the same as mending\u2014but it went small and hard and cracked like old sugar. He dropped it in the recycling bin, and it clinked.\n\nWhen he went back inside the library, the fluorescent tube nearest the information desk squealed as if someone had trod on a mouse. He put his palm flat under it, and it stopped.\n\nEvening. He came out in a fine rain and walked down the lane toward the river because he often did, and the river did not look back in the way that some people did. By the Bass the teenagers were exhaling their gossip. He took the path under the willow where the ground smelled like roots and never quite dried. A man in a waterproof was throwing something into the water and hauling nothing out. The willow leaves touched the water and recoiled. Out past the branches, a skein of white caught on a submerged twig. Bags, three, four, two cabled together, their handles tightening like belts.\n\nEwan leaned and let his hand hover over them. A tremor ran up his wrist. The bags had something in them, and it moved, slow and homely as old hair. He grimaced. He should go home. He should let Archie freakin Young of all people, who wore a hi-vis vest and managed the town\u2019s less dramatic emergencies, deal with the tangles that needed cutting. He couldn\u2019t.\n\nHe stepped into the shallows in his boots, winced as the water invaded them, swore on the breath not in any language you could print, and reached for the nearest handle. The plastic bit his fingers, not sharply, but with a weird suck. He pulled, and the handles pulled back\u2014not strong, not as if someone held the other end, but as if they were swelling. He had an instant\u2019s picture of the town full of swollen bags, all the bags, gathering their own breath and producing something like language.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d he said out loud, and the syllables scraped his throat going out. He shook the bag hard. He felt a snap. The rustling went thin, thin, then snapped too. He dragged the first bag free and threw it on the path. The others held. He looked at them and saw the charm: not a charm done neat with cords and notes and proper binding, but a hack. A lash-up. A taking of how wind moves and how water would like to carry and a brisk little knot tied with fingers that did not have patience for smallness.\n\nEwan bent and cut them\u2014at the place where movement meets motive, the bit in between, a place you can put a word if you know which word. He cut a few. The rest slid away and sank. He stood with water in his socks and stared at the bag on the path. There was a logo on it from a garden centre that had closed two years ago: a tree with an impossible canopy made of tiny plastic leaves. The handles were stiff as regret.\n\nHe heard it then, faintly. Not a cockerel. No. He would have known that; his skin would have cringed and his stomach climbed his spine. This was the sound of many, many thin things rubbing, as if somewhere nearby a man had set himself a task of folding and refolding every bag he found, and had decided that folding was too tidy and refolding back to crumple was better. The noise lurked in the hedges, hissed in the verge. He could not tell if it came from one place or all.\n\nFrom the bend above the path, a man came down with a fishing rod over his shoulder. He had a face that smudged when Ewan tried to pin it, like a chalkboard written on and wiped halfheartedly. He wore a cap with no badge. He shifted his rod to his other shoulder as he met Ewan and nodded. He looked past him at the bag by Ewan\u2019s foot as if it were just a bag. His eyes were the colour of plastic when it\u2019s white and thinks it's clear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll watch the path,\u201d Ewan said, surprising himself because he never addressed strangers first. The man said nothing for a heartbeat, then smiled in a way that did not advertise teeth and said, \u201cAye. Watch my path. Good night.\u201d His accent was local and not local, a good copy a fraction too well rehearsed. He went on and the bag sound went with him.\n\nEwan picked up the garden centre bag and shoved it into the inside pocket of his coat. He regretted it as soon as he did it. He felt as if he had invited something rude into his jacket, and now it sat against his chest, whispering. He tried to shake it off. He walked home the long way, cutting across streets where the hedges were tidy. When he reached his front step he put his hand to the bag through the cloth and said, \u201cQuiet, now.\u201d\n\nIt did not quiet. All evening the bag talked. He set it on his table and wrote letters around it. He composed a line to his grandmother\u2014if she had been alive; she wasn\u2019t; she\u2019d have told him to get over himself and get a thicker coat. He ate cold oatcakes. He stared at the bag and thought of the man with the fishing rod and eyes the colour of plastic. He eventually slept with his hand pressed to his stomach, and dreamed that he lay on a bed of leaves that were not leaves but the thin white ones printed to look like leaves, and that his breath fogged inside a clear sack, harmless and terrifying, and that somewhere, beyond a wall of crinkling, a rooster stood on a barrel and announced itself like a king.\n\nMorning again. He placed the bag under the sink beside the compost bin, because that seemed like an insult to it and he liked to test the manners of things that had too much self-regard. He went to work. He mended a clock. He told the schoolboys that geometry was older and better than any of them, and that the triangles were not the problem; the problem was that they were boys. He took a call from Archie who said, \u201cYe hear any chat about folk putting bags in the river? Been complaints.\u201d Archie was a bluff man who wore his hair like a helmet. He had been unkind to Ewan once in school, and boys who are unkind make men who think they are being kind when they are not.\n\n\u201cBags,\u201d Ewan said.\n\n\u201cAye. Bags.\u201d Archie snorted. \u201cAs if there\u2019s not bins enough. Anyway, ye ken what folk are like.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep an ear,\u201d Ewan said, and hung up without meaning to be rude.\n\nAfter lunch he took the bus toward Thainstone and got off two stops early. He walked among the half-abandoned retail spaces whose wildflower beds had availed themselves of the shadow of discount signage and turned vigorous. The old garden centre sat with its windows blank with dust and paper. The sign above the door was gone; the bolts showed out like missing teeth. Far off near the livestock mart there was a shout and the skitter of hooves, and nearer the wind wove itself into knots among the railings.\n\nHe walked round the back. There was a door with a flaking padlock. The padlock was not locked. He pushed, and the door took the push as an offense. He stepped inside into the smell of old fertilizer and newer plastic. The light came through the high panes thick with dirt. His eyes made scabs of it and rubbed them off.\n\nIt was not empty. That was not surprising. People left things in places they thought were empty. The surprising thing was the care. Piles of bags, folded like flags. Stacks of them, colour-coded: white, cream, half-transparent, blue letters, green letters, bags with special gussets, bags with handles knotted together to make long chains. On the floor chalk marks drew circles and inside the circles lay arrangements: a star of polypropelene weaving, a spiral of sandwich bags tight as a snail shell, a grid of crisp packets like armour for a small city. On the chalk someone had written names of winds. Southeasterly. Haar. That word he recognized: the sea mist that came up from nowhere on some summer mornings and put its clammy hands on your neck.\n\nThere were jars too. Not jam jars like his. Sterile glass, labelled with tidy pen: Aisle Whisper, Till Sleeze, Parking Lot Cry. A sample of the supermarket, bottled. When he held one, a slink of feeling went up his wrist. The writing was a little too neat, and that was how he knew the man's magic wasn\u2019t good. True acts have smudged edges.\n\nAt the far end, near where the greenhouse had been, a chair faced a wall on which there were photographs taped. He went closer. They were ordinary pictures, none of them magical unless you felt what he did, that all ordinary things are magic if you are standing in a place that makes the skin thin. A shot of the river with sunlight on its wrinkled back. A disused lot where thistles had gone to white. A line of trolleys left out overnight. On the river picture someone had drawn in pen, not good pen but careful, circles where plastic gathers. On the trolley picture the word NEST had been written.\n\nEwan stood with his hands in his coat. He should not be here. He was in a man\u2019s house, though the man paid no rent and invited no guests. He should not breathe this man\u2019s air or read his handwriting.\n\nThe sound of bags rubbing went up mid-note as if its conductor had stepped onto his box and raised a baton. Ewan turned.\n\nHe did not see the man from the river. He saw something else: a structure like a curtain of carriers strung side by side, making a wall that moved because it did not understand truly what a wall does. Behind it a shadow. Behind the shadow someone\u2019s breath. He never knew later why he did not run then. The fear of cockerel would have sent him if a rooster had raised its voice. But this was plastic. Plastic only rustles. Plastic does not crow.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 what are you?\u201d It was a question without the question mark. The voice came from behind the curtain. Ewan didn\u2019t believe in dread naming, but he felt the pull of names as a river feels the tug of bridges. You say your own name, and you\u2019re tied. You say the other\u2019s name, and the knot\u2019s in your fingers.\n\n\u201cEwan,\u201d he said anyway. Lies coil; truth often lies straight enough to look like flooring. \u201cFrom the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cLibrary,\u201d the voice repeated, and the bags said the same, a little softer. \u201cYou must like quiet. Good for you. Quiet\u2019s honest. Goes about its business. But people don\u2019t respect quiet. They clutter it. They litter it. They pile their\u2026 their crap into nice quiet, and it\u2019s up to someone to tidy. Isn\u2019t it.\u201d The last two words sighed around the room like a cleaning cloth.\n\nThe figure behind the curtain moved. Ewan saw, high up on the wall, a standard retail store clock. It ticked. It had a cracked plastic cover. He focused on the crack, on how it wobbled the second hand. He could always, if pressed, find a detail to live inside until the large shape passed by.\n\n\u201cMy name is Blaise,\u201d the voice said. It was not Blaise\u2019s name in any permanent way. Names on true people have a way of moving around until they find the posture that suits them. This name sat uncomfortably on the man, as if he had borrowed it from a book and kept the receipt. \u201cBlaise Carrid. I gather what is thrown away. I am diligent. Self-sufficient. Civic-minded.\u201d He let each phrase ripple a little in the air like a banner of cellophane.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re proud of using too many bags,\u201d Ewan said, letting the sentence fall out before the part of him with caution could sharpen it. \u201cThat\u2019s a\u2026 novelty.\u201d He tried for light. The floor tried along with him and held his weight.\n\nThe curtain lifted, and there he was. Not smudged now. His face had lines a little too straight, as if someone had drawn in cheekbones but didn\u2019t love them. His eyes were tired, which can make people kind or cruel. He wore a tidy shirt under a tidy jacket under which the pockets bulged. Each bulge rustled.\n\n\u201cNot proud,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cObedient.\u201d He lifted a pair of handles in his hand and let them dangle. \u201cThe world made these. They are here. They will not\u2026 depart. Men throw, wind fetches, river blends. Do you expect me to refuse the materials I am given? There\u2019s a call. There is a call and it\u2019s not the cockerels in fields.\u201d He watched Ewan\u2019s face change as if testing clay between his fingers. \u201cI know you,\u201d he added, softly. \u201cThe boy who can\u2019t stand the morning. The boy who tells light it is not welcome above a certain volume. I always think of you when I hear that\u2026 horn.\u201d He mimed a rooster\u2019s beak with his hand. It was an ugly little motion, but it told Ewan enough. The man had been in town long enough to learn gossip from the way people look away, or he had seen Ewan by a fence once. Perhaps he had made inquiries. People speak without wanting to. They confess in the shells of words.\n\nEwan looked at the curtain of plastic and the chalk circles and the photographs clung to the wall like limpets kissing rock. He could say the following: stop. He could say the other following thing: teach me. He could ask, and think that asking would make a rope, and the rope with a tug would lead him out. But the man\u2019s room hummed with wanting. It was a stuck kind of wanting, the worst kind\u2014the kind that is so sure its own central feeling is duty that it cannot recognize appetite.\n\n\u201cPeople will come,\u201d Ewan said instead. \u201cWith keys and torches and the right to pick up what is not theirs. If you leave it looking like this, they will come, and you will not be able to tell them an interesting story about wind. They won\u2019t hear it.\u201d He had the distinct sensation of being someone else\u2019s tongue. He was speaking, but the words had the weight of a future that had already written a paragraph in someone else\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d Blaise exhaled very slightly and tipped his head as if there was a draught under it. \u201cYou worry for me. Very librarian of you. Well. The river and I have an arrangement. It feeds me. I feed it. I take what men gave it and give it back when it asks in a better shape. I make nests for wind; wind loves me. I make long handles for river; river uses them for own devices. Nobody complains when swans use our reeds. Nobody cries out when crows weave twine into their beds. Why do they call me\u2026 villain? Eh?\u201d He smiled then. It was tired, he was tired, but there was something behind it that was not tired at all. A wire. A hunger with reasons.\n\nEwan could have said: because you are lying. Because wind doesn\u2019t love men named Blaise any more than it loves glass doors. Because the kind of giving you imagine is a theft with bows on. He did not say any of that because he did not know it yet as knowledge; he felt it as ache and itch.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be here when the light goes,\u201d Blaise said, and the wall of bags sighed a little in on itself, making a poor imitation of a curtain. \u201cHens go to roost. Men with harsh torches go to their vans. Midnight is full of professionals. Go home, Mr. Calder. We could talk again another time. Take whatever fancy photographs of leaves you like with your head. The building will not board up if I do not invite it. We can let time sit between us like a sofa. You on one end. Me in my sensible seat. We both insist we\u2019re comfortable.\u201d\n\nEwan put his hand in his coat pocket and touched one of his own knots. He thought of his grandmother again, then of how the sky over the hill went the colour of fish belly when mist came. He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said, and stepped out past the curtain, which touched his shoulder and gave him a static lick that lifted the hair on his arm under his sleeve.\n\nOutside, the light looked both thinner and more polite, as if it had heard someone say it was unwanted and had resolved to behave. He walked back along the edge of the car park where grass had come up and made optimistic little nations between lines of tarmac. He thought of how Blaise had said his name. He thought of the photograph of trolleys and how the word NEST made them look like a family. Sabotage loves to look familial. He looked toward Thainstone; he could see the silver of the marts\u2019 roofs and, beyond them, the polite teeth of the bypass. He heard a far crow.\n\nHe had to stop. He put his hand flat on the bonnet of an abandoned Land Rover and breathed like a diver who forgot he had gills. The crowing was not even close, but it found him all the same. The air tightened. My magic hates this sound, he thought, and then his magic, which was not a pet but a shape his life had taken, said back, No, it doesn\u2019t. It hates what you think it means. It was an unkind answer. He stood until the quiet lapped back in.\n\nWhen he reached his own door, there was a note under the mat.\n\nEwan,\n\n\u2014 if this is the right cottage, if it is not, apologies to whomever reads it \u2014 I am down at the allotments this evening at six. There\u2019s a matter of\u2026 let\u2019s call it community tidiness. Archie says I shouldn\u2019t bother ye. Archie is often wrong.\n\nMhairi Latch\n\nHe didn\u2019t breathe again for two breaths. Mhairi Latch had been his grandmother\u2019s friend and her particular enemy when they were fifteen. They fell out, moved on, fell back, like two dogs who love in their precise brutal way. Mhairi had taught him that you can make a charm out of a rowan twig and a compliment said under your breath to the person you least wished well. He had not seen her in months. When the old hands retire they do not go to Spain; they go behind hedges and watch.\n\nHe went. The allotments were wind-chapped. The bean poles were like a village of thin people saying their prayers. Mhairi was there in her cardy, her scarf knotted under her chin, kneeling as if she were making offerings to a deity of her own vegetables. He did not know why he had thought for a second she might be gone; the woman had buried two husbands, three dogs and five ugly roses and remained herself like granite remains itself through the ages.\n\n\u201cYe took your time,\u201d she said when he came to her. \u201cI ken ye, lad. Ye think yourself going unseen like cloud. Clouds are the most seen things going.\u201d\n\nHe took off his cap and bent to kiss the air near her cheek because she never liked the feel of faces doing that. \u201cMhairi.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoira tells me ye\u2019ve got one of the Bagman\u2019s messes at your house.\u201d\n\nEwan did not ask how she knew. Things rot in gardens and go sweet again. Information does the same. \u201cUnder the sink.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye. That\u2019s as good a place as any. He likes bearings.\u201d She looked at the soil. \u201cYe\u2019ve seen him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so. He told me his name. Blaise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong,\u201d she said immediately. The spade chopped the earth. \u201cThat\u2019s not his name. But he\u2019d like ye ta think it is. He says a thing and covers it with another thing and calls it care. He uses too many of everything, not just bags. Too many reasons. Too many excuses. Too many noises. Men like that, ye don\u2019t push. Ye don\u2019t resist either. Ye stand and watch till they walk into their own hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could stop\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAch, laddie. Men who tangle the world\u2019s leavings and make them sing in key think they can mop up a whole river with a towel. They believe their hands are bigger than they are. They go home with their hands stinging. They like the sting. If ye go to them with a broom, they\u2019ll make you into a brush.\u201d She looked up at him then, and her eyes were knives. \u201cWhy are yae shaking?\u201d\n\nHe had not noticed his hands. He looked. \u201cI heard\u2026 one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBird?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. She made a face. \u201cCockerels are fools. So are the folk who keep em outside town where they dinna belong. But mark me. They tell truths. They say, Morning\u2019s here. Ye cannae bury the morning under a rug, Ewan. Ye can draw little lines of magic across it, aye, ye can, and it\u2019ll still step over and be day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d He thought of how Blaise had mimed the rooster with his hand, that little ugly pecking motion made to hurt more than to entertain. His stomach turned the way dogs do tight circles before they settle. \u201cHe\u2019s doing something with the bags. Not only\u2026 untidy things. He\u2019s making structures. He\u2019s naming winds. He\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWent to school somewhere he thought was grand,\u201d Mhairi said dryly. \u201cThinkers who never touched a real dirty thing love to think of how wonderful dirt is.\u201d She stood up with a groan you could stitch a sack with. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk. We\u2019ll look at his wind. We\u2019ll look at what wind sees.\u201d\n\nThey went along the ditch. The sky had ridged itself like long muscle. Mhairi walked with her stick in the way of women who know exactly how hard ground is, which is very. They did not talk until they got to the place where the hedgerow turned and made a shy corner. There, caught on a hawthorn, was a net. Not rope, no twine. Bags plaited into bags, simple, elegant in its ugliness. It had faceted itself into something almost beautiful, and that was perhaps its worst offense. It had held a pheasant, which was all bones and feathers. The bones were gone now; just a fan of brown and green feathers remained, stuck on a prickle. Ewan made a noise without its own noun, and Mhairi put her hand on the net as if introducing herself to it at a funeral.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019ll expose him,\u201d she said calmly, as if reading it somewhere he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cHe\u2019ll go behind bars. That last is not our doing. That last is the job for Archie and the men with clipboards and the men who like to type. But before that he\u2019ll be at his most interesting. They always are, the moment before they are caught. They think themselves either safest or cleverest; both make good theatre. Ye\u2019ll be there, because ye\u2019re daft that way.\u201d She looked at him, and the pity in her face didn\u2019t soften it. It made it harder. \u201cAnd you\u2019re brave, which is not the same thing as not being afeart. Afeart\u2019s a good start. The heart that knows what fright is, that heart can bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026\u201d He groped. \u201cHuman,\u201d he finished. \u201cThe way it moves. The way it wants to be wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said. \u201cAll human rubbish is human. That\u2019s the curse.\u201d\n\nWhen he went home there was a cockerel standing on his gatepost.\n\nHe stopped where he was. Its head turned. Its eye was a button. Buttons are innocent and also not. He could not say why there would be a cockerel here, in a row of cottages where the covenants said no poultry and no midnight drumming. It shook its feathers and did not crow. He thanked it without moving for its restraint. It tilted its head further as if listening for that thanks, and in the splashed light on its neck the colours were too splendid. The world does that sometimes, sweetening the thing you fear. He felt it examine him. He let it. His palms were slick.\n\nFrom the hedge, a bag lifted and put itself down again, as if too shy to wave.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d he said, and he did. Blaise would be the sort to use every part of a town\u2019s habits. If his spells made the wind hop at his command and the river bring him offerings, what would he not recruit? Birds were easy. They bore messages for those who wanted messages to be the kind that came with claws. He took off his cap and held it in both hands. He did not bow. He did not speak a charm, because he understood suddenly that charm was not for this. This needed something else. He thought for a long moment, then added, in his ordinary voice, \u201cYou\u2019re very handsome. I wish you a good evening. Please go.\u201d\n\nThe rooster blinked. Things often work at the point where you don\u2019t expect them to because you didn\u2019t draw a big circle round your expectation. The bird scratched once, turned, hopped off the post, and went, with all the rude grace of a creature who gives no respect to concepts, into the lane. The bag in the hedge settled.\n\nHe went inside. He put his hands in the sink under the cold tap and left them there until they hurt so well that the thought of another kind of hurt couldn\u2019t fit. He took the bag from under the sink and laid it on the table. He cut it into seven pieces, not with scissors but with a knife of words his grandmother had taught him that had never needed sharpening. He folded the pieces and set one under each leg of the table and the chair and under the door and the window and gave the seventh to the fire. The pieces did not smoke. They did not stink. He slept, and it was the first night in two days that the plastic in the air did not whisper him awake with its thousand unused syllables.\n\nIn the morning he called Archie.\n\n\u201cI have a thing,\u201d he said, not knowing yet which word he would pick for it. \u201cA\u2026 situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe always say that when you\u2019ve found a cat,\u201d Archie grumbled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cat. It\u2019s a man with a store.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it a legal store?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. Where.\u201d\n\nEwan told him. He did not tell him about the jars, the chalk, the way the curtain made a joke of walls. He did not tell him about the way Blaise had put his hand to his beak like a boy. He told him enough to get Archie\u2019s boots to the place and his lads behind. His voice was steady. It went across the phone line and did not snag.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019ll be there?\u201d Archie said, too casual.\n\n\u201cI read the papers.\u201d The dodge. The old dodge that had gotten him away from questions since he was twelve.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019ll be there. Ye should be there. Bloody witness is another word for problem, did ye ken?\u201d Archie hung up sounding irritated, which had always meant\u2014Ewan had learned this the hard way\u2014that he cared.\n\nHe put on his coat, tucked charms in odd places, then took them out again and left them on the table. He stood and looked at Bennachie through the window\u2014the hill with its shoulders shrugged against a sky that would make all its usual promises and break only the ones it did not know it had made\u2014and went out. The light was too honest to do anyone\u2019s lying for them; that would come later. He walked, and the wind, obliging, brought him the city\u2019s new music: rustle-rustle, whisper-whisper, bag bag bag, as if a crowd had learned a new word and liked the shape it made in their mouths and would say it as many times as possible before they were told to hush.\n\nOn the corner by the bus stop, Moira raised her hand. \u201cEwan! Archie\u2019s looking for ye.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll find me,\u201d Ewan said, an odd voice. He had the sensation that time had split. In one time he went about his day and came home with salt on his boots. In another time he would not come home the same. He stepped around the cockerel on the post that was no longer there but would always, in a way, be.\n\nIn the co-op window there was a sign: please re-use your carrier bags. Below it, someone had scrawled, in black, please. The second please was badly shaped, but it looked more like a prayer. He hoped prayers like that counted. He hoped someone, somewhere, was counting. He thought of Mhairi\u2019s knife eyes and Blaise\u2019s tidied jacket and the way wind really sounds when it\u2019s willing to show you its inside, and he walked, picking his way on the pavement that knows more of feet than any oracle. There is always a meeting. He went to his.Chapter 3\n\nArchie\u2019s van was a rectangle of determination squatting under the by-pass, light bars cold on top, dirt caked on the wheel arches like consequence. Two other vans had come\u2014council lads with grabbers and heavy gloves, and the police car that smelled of coffee and rain even before you got near it. Ewan felt their purpose the way you feel a storm before it rounds the hill. He slowed his step without meaning to. His feet knew this was a hinge hour, and feet get to vote even if you think you\u2019re running the meeting.\n\nArchie saw him and rolled his shoulders to look taller. He wore authority like he wore his orange vest: obvious, a bit too bright, but it kept you safe in traffic. \u201cRight, Calder,\u201d he called, not unkind. \u201cYe\u2019ve the key, aye?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lock,\u201d Ewan said. He lifted his hand, palm upward, a bodily shrug that said he hadn\u2019t come to lead anything. \u201cBack door opens if you push it as if you\u2019re apologizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, well,\u201d Archie muttered, \u201cwe\u2019ll push like we mean it.\u201d He glanced at PC Lyle, a tidy woman with hair pulled to a point at the back of her head and eyes like new pennies. She didn\u2019t look much older than the schoolboys who swore at triangles, but her posture said she was paid to do this and also born to. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it calm,\u201d she said, to no one and everyone. \u201cIf he\u2019s there, we talk first. If he\u2019s not there, we document. No drama.\u201d\n\nMhairi had come without being asked, as she had always come to any place there might be a use for her noticing. She had a basket over her arm, the sort you see in old pictures of women with heads for market arithmetic. She nodded at Ewan and then at Archie as if distributing points. \u201cNo one touches anything wi bare hands,\u201d she announced, as if hired to consult. \u201cNo one stands where wind can push ye without ye knowing. If there\u2019s jars, leave em be unless ye ken your jar-magic from your elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho invited the knitting circle?\u201d one of the council lads muttered, and Mhairi turned her head very slightly. The lad colored in a way that suggested he\u2019d been an altar boy once and still recognized certain kinds of holiness.\n\nThey walked the side of the shuttered units, past the place where purple loosestrife had exploited a crack and made itself queen of an island of gravel. The old garden centre sat with its mouth shut, paper scabbed on the windows and an advertisement for compost so faded it looked like a watercolor of rot. Archie reached the door with his competent big-man walk, put his hand to the padlock and found, as Ewan had, that locks are for people who believe every box must have a lid. The chain dropped with a complaining noise. He pushed and the door breathed plastic.\n\nThe rustling rose. It was a choir and a tide and a thousand dresses in a thousand changing rooms deciding whether they fit. The men paused as if the noise were a dog you had to let sniff you before you reached out a hand. Ewan stepped to the side, where the shadow held a bit richer, and put his palm to the cool flake of wall just to tell it he was here and had come to mind the place too. He didn\u2019t love these acts of forgetting\u2014entering and making inventory of another\u2019s life\u2014but sometimes the world\u2019s lungs get clogged and you bring hot water and you do what you do and call it mercy.\n\nInside the light was again that dirt-sieved softness, and the arrangements were as he\u2019d seen them but altered with a care that knew it was being watched. The curtain of carriers hung like a drawn breath you weren\u2019t allowed to let out yet. The chalk circles had been swept once, briskly, so that their edges blurred into the concrete like thought into sleep. On the wall the photographs had multiplied and now there were phrases written around them in a regular hand: COLLECTING IS CARE. TIDY IS LOVE. The statements sat like labels under museum glasswork, inviting your conscience to nod.\n\n\u201cGuid God,\u201d Archie breathed. \u201cHe\u2019s daft.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaft\u2019s a tool,\u201d Mhairi said. \u201cPlenty use it to make a point sharp.\u201d She put the basket down and took out gloves, the pink fairy-liquid sort that looked ridiculous on her and did not make her less dangerous. She passed a pair to Ewan. \u201cOn.\u201d\n\nPC Lyle\u2019s radio muttered and then calmed. She stepped forward until she was the person at the hinge point and spoke into the room as if the room had ears that wanted to be used, which it did. \u201cSir,\u201d she said, voice even, carrying. \u201cBlaise Carrid? Anyone? This is the police. We\u2019re here to discuss reports and to ensure nobody\u2019s hurt. We\u2019d like a chat.\u201d\n\nThe curtain moved. Not like a stage curtain drawn back to reveal, not theatrically; rather like a skin that had changed its mind and decided to be a door. It parted just enough to put a person through and then closed because that was its habit. Blaise came out in his tidy jacket and his tired eyes that, close up, were paler than was good for anyone. He held a jar in one hand with care as if it were a baby\u2019s head. In the other hand his fingers pinched a pair of bag handles as if for reassurance.\n\n\u201cOfficer,\u201d he said, and his voice went to a scraping gentleness. \u201cWelcome. Have you brought your litter picks? I find I never have enough hands.\u201d\n\nArchie made a noise that had a swear in it in all but the letters. PC Lyle shifted her weight in the way of a person prepared to be colossally patient and also to turn into a lighthouse if needed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had complaints,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout obstructions. About traps. About\u2026 installations in public pathways. About harm to wildlife. We need a look round and a discussion of what\u2019s yours and what\u2019s not yours to keep.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is mine that everyone else throws away,\u201d Blaise said. He smiled in a manner that tried for reasonable and landed just past the mark. \u201cI am your bin. I am your conscience made busy. I am what the council would be if the council had a heart. Look how I have made it neat.\u201d He gestured and the bag wall rustled as if applauding.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019re catching birds,\u201d Archie snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s all the neat ye need to ken.\u201d He jerked his chin at the curtain. \u201cWhat\u2019s behind?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy thoughts,\u201d Blaise said, softening his mouth into sympathy for his own joke. He looked at Ewan then, as if they had a private conversation waiting to be resumed. \u201cMr. Calder. I\u2019m glad you came. Librarians are the proper audience for any man\u2019s archive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not an archive,\u201d Ewan said. He didn\u2019t know he was going to say it; the sentence had been sitting in him, a pebble ready for tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re a blockage pretending to be a collection. Archives know the future will need a path through. You\u2019re making a maze because you like watching people try the wrong way first.\u201d\n\nBlaise\u2019s eyes held him for a beat that pinched exactly where embarrassment and satisfaction meet. He lifted the jar a little in a gesture of toast. \u201cA fair speech. Would you like to hear my wind?\u201d He held the jar up for the room like a priest might hold a wafer. The label read in that clean hand: HAAR, BOUGHT AND PAID. He twisted the lid. A smell came out like wet paper and salt, and along with it a sound too small to measure until it passed your ear and suddenly you knew you\u2019d heard it all your life when mornings went white. The edges of the room softened. Concrete went a shade like milk that\u2019s just realized it is no longer in the cow. Archie swore properly this time. The council lads swore too, but quieter, as if sound itself had thickened.\n\nEwan felt the pressure the sound made not on his eardrum so much as on the little hairs of his arms. He watched the jar. He watched Blaise\u2019s hand on the lid and understood he had been honest the last time in one small thing: he did not have patience for smallness. The twist of the lid, the press of the thumb to make the seal break, the care of the tongue of tin as it unrolled\u2014Blaise liked the big act in those tiny acts. He liked a scale model of power.\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d PC Lyle said, calm as the inside of a teacup. \u201cWe\u2019re here to secure an unsafe site and arrest if necessary. Mr. Carrid, I\u2019m going to ask you to place the container on the table and step back. We can talk about what you think you\u2019re doing with the river, but we\u2019ll do it without tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cTricks,\u201d Blaise repeated, tasting the word to see if it had any sugar left. \u201cNo. Not tricks. Remedies. Palliatives. You might say a cream on a rash. Your wind complains to me, Officer. It says, \u2018Men have poked holes in me and called it clean living.\u2019 It says, \u2018I carry your bright suffering to the hedgerows and hold it there like I am paid to hold.\u2019 I give wind comfort. I give wind a way to be beautiful again.\u201d\n\nMhairi took a step, which was really three steps and the history of her ankles, and placed herself very gently beside the table with the jars. Her hands went nowhere near them. She looked at Blaise the way a wall looks at ivy. \u201cYe\u2019re hurting things,\u201d she said. There were words that belonged to court and council minutes and she did not bother with them. \u201cYe\u2019re hurting things and that\u2019s not all right. Ye say beautiful as if it were a word that belonged to ye. Beauty does not cover blood.\u201d\n\nBlaise\u2019s face pinched then. For a moment, the neatness went, and what was under it looked raw and underfed. \u201cI\u2019m tidying,\u201d he said. It had the weight of a plea and the edge of threat. \u201cNo one thanks a man for tidying. But afterwards they look around and they think the world is better behaved somehow, and they never think why. I gather. I keep. I make uses. I tell wind where to sleep and water where to lay down its cargo. I make nests for the plastic birds, Miss\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMhairi Latch,\u201d she said briskly, because withholding a name is sometimes power and sometimes pettiness and she picked generosity as the sharper blade. \u201cAn\u2019 ye dinna get ta call me Miss as if that made me a decoration in your speech.\u201d She looked at the curtain. \u201cWhat ye built is moving wrong. It\u2019s trying to make itself into a sea with a skin. Seas dinna like skins. Do ye ken how many wee lives live in a thread o water at the edge o that car park? Ye\u2019re blocking them with your good intentions.\u201d\n\nA sound came from the far side of the curtain. Not wind. Not bag. Not man. A shuffle and a startle. PC Lyle\u2019s head turned the way a cat\u2019s does when it knows there\u2019s a mouse under the board. \u201cSir,\u201d she called, louder. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone else in there, come out. Now, please.\u201d\n\nThe curtain shifted in a slow pulse and then parted enough to spit out a boy. He was fourteen by his bones and seventeen by his mouth and six by his eyes, which were very large in a ghastly way. He had the look of someone who has breathed recirculated air too long and now can\u2019t remember if air can be got in other ways. His hoodie bore a school crest in the same way a pond bears summer pollen. He clutched a chain of knotted handles and did not seem to know his hand was doing it. \u201cHe said we were doing good,\u201d he said, politeness still clinging to him like sugar. \u201cHe said it was art. He said it\u2019d stop the birds choakin.\u201d He looked at Mhairi the way boys look at women who have never betrayed them. \u201cWas that wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cNae your wrong,\u201d Mhairi said. She moved like the ground moving under snow. She put her hand on the chain, and her glove creaked. \u201cYe go outside with the officer now and get a drink. Ye say, \u2018I was there, I dinna ken why,\u2019 and ye say your mam\u2019s name three times. That\u2019ll set your heart to its true size again.\u201d\n\nPC Lyle, to her credit, did not snort at the order about names. She stepped to the boy and took him as if he had come to her because he liked her, not because a lot of adults had given him no choice. They went to the door and light lay on them briefly like a blessing.\n\nArchie rubbed his neck. \u201cChrist alive. He\u2019s got bairns in here, Calder. I thought this was just one of those loners who mutter in the post office queue.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never been alone a day in his life,\u201d Ewan said. The words surprised him with their authority. He had been alone the particular way that means you can hear certain voices. Blaise\u2019s voice snagged him because it was pitched to end up inside men like him.\n\nBlaise smiled at him again because he could not let anything be said without wanting to own it. \u201cChildren are better at civic spirit than you think,\u201d he said. \u201cThey believe in rules, if you tell them rules are a kind of kindness. They believe in gleaning. They like to be on a team that is praised by the sky. They have not yet been told that cleaning is women\u2019s work and unbeautiful, and so they bring me the bits you leave in your hedges and I make their efforts matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make yourself matter to yourself,\u201d Ewan said. He wanted not to be roused to point-scoring, but here they were, two men, and logic never saved men from themselves. \u201cThe rest is arras.\u201d\n\n\u201cArras,\u201d Blaise said, pleased with the medievalism and the way it made his mouth feel. \u201cYes. Curtains. Hides and reveals. We do love a reveal. For example.\u201d He put his hand in the bulge of his jacket and brought out a small device, one of those cheap plastic boxes you buy to make a noise on a farm gate when foxes come. He pressed it and the box crowed.\n\nIt was a poor crow. It was tinny, a parody, more door than bird. It was also enough. Ewan had time to think, It\u2019s not the sound, it\u2019s what I think it means, and then the hinge opened in him and all his careful ties loosened. The jars on the table hummed. The curtain made an encouraging sound as if for a child taking its first step. Bags along the wall lifted their handles as if they had been given rehearsal instructions.\n\nHe put his hand out blindly and found, absurdly, the old retail clock. The second hand ticked. He held it with his palm and felt the rude time of shops\u2014a fast, restful measure\u2014run into his skin. He took a breath. He made himself shape it into a softer thing than panic. He heard his grandmother say, You can\u2019t stop the rooster saying his say, you can only make promises about what you\u2019ll do when he\u2019s done. He made himself remember the bowl. He made himself remember three seconds.\n\nHe had no bowl, which was maybe a mercy because bowls had failed him. He had his mouth. He breathed out, a tiny steadying stream, and on that breath he laid his spell like dust on a mantel. It was not a hex or a ban. It was a promise. He said, just under hearing and not at all under hope, \u201cI will see what I need to see and stop. And then start. And then stop. And start again.\u201d\n\nIn that sliver of calm the crowing was ridiculous rather than monumental, and the room knew the difference. The jars dimmed a fraction. The curtain faltered. Blaise\u2019s finger on the button pressed harder as if pressing harder had ever taught a machine more meaning.\n\nArchie, who started life as a boy who hit things until they broke and had become a man who now knew how not to, raised his hand in the way he did when stopping traffic and said to his crew, \u201cCut the strings.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at the bag handles. He was looking at the lines where Blaise\u2019s installations met the anchor points\u2014the bits tied to the metal shelf uprights, to the window struts, to the nailed-down tables. He\u2019d done enough festivals and fair days to know that if you unhook the points, the bunting falls without fuss.\n\nThe lads waded toward the curtain in their gloves, and the curtain, affronted, tried to be clever. It flexed and made a pouch and tried to cup a man. It went rigid and tried to become a wall. It failed at being anything but itself, which was embarrassing to watch. Mhairi put the flat of her hand under the nearest fluorescent tube and its squeal, which had been rising in the noise like a violin in a nervous orchestra, flattened obediently. \u201cWe\u2019re not at your concert, son,\u201d she told the light. \u201cYe\u2019ve had your turn.\u201d\n\nBlaise moved then, quick, the way men do when a plan has gone from being a beautiful concept to being a thing that has to dodge boots. He snapped another jar\u2019s lid\u2014the label said PARKING LOT CRY\u2014and for an instant everyone smelled petrol and lonely. Outside, a gull shouted the sort of laugh that makes you doubt your pride. He lifted his bag-handles rope like a whip and swung it. The rope hit Archie\u2019s arm, and for a second it stuck, not glue, not magic like the stories tell; static, the sort that raises your hair and makes your teeth remember tin foil. Archie swore and shook his arm and the stuckness went and left a memory.\n\n\u201cAll right, Mr. Carrid,\u201d PC Lyle said, and the tea-cup calm turned to ceramic you could break a head with. She put her hand to her belt and pulled from it not a truncheon, not a gun, just a pair of scissors, the sort you use for casualty tape. She held them up so he could see. \u201cWe will be cutting your ties,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will be cutting your access. We will be cutting off your\u2026 air.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at Ewan, but he felt as if she had set him an exercise in the proper use of the word hinge.\n\nEwan moved along the wall towards the photographs because the photographs were the place where Blaise\u2019s wanting had to make marks you could read. Among the river circles and trolley lines, one image had been added. It was Bennachie, drawn badly with felt-tip, a child\u2019s profile of a hill with ears. Across the summit someone had written: COCKPIT. He made a noise of his own, the kind you make when someone has put a grubby thumb on your best plate.\n\nHe reached under the table for the charm he\u2019d felt the last time and found not his own card under cardboard, but something Blaise had fixed there: a twist of grey plastic like a nest with a pebble in it. He held it. It thrummed. He thought, He\u2019s made himself a cockerel. He\u2019s made himself a morning he controls. He felt anger in him rise the way bread rises, swelling and fragrant and not helpful if not punched down. He remembered the co-op sign: please re-use your carrier bags. The second please like a prayer. He looked at the pebble. He breathed on it. He said, simple as the label on the jar and truer, \u201cPlease stop.\u201d\n\nSometimes that is the whole spell. Not often, because the world is large and polite does not always move it. But if you say Please to a thing that has been used for too many not-pleases, sometimes the thing sighs. The thrumming eased. He put the cheap nest back under the cardboard where it would have to content itself with wincing at feet above. He stood again and saw that Blaise\u2019s hand had shifted towards the door as if to find a path. He said, because men who make mazes often forget that other men see them too, \u201cDon\u2019t run. You\u2019ll make it worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse for whom?\u201d Blaise snapped. He seemed thinner in the light. The jars on the table sat sullenly. The curtain had lost any pretense to being a wall and slumped, half-fallen, two council lads picking it apart like a knitting disaster. He gripped his sound box. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand morning, Mr. Calder. You never did. You think it\u2019s a thing that happens to you. It\u2019s a structure. It\u2019s a song you can teach. I have made a morning that doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He lifted the little crow machine and pressed it until it buzzed. It made, this time, a sound so sad and so cheap that even his own installation went embarrassed and refused to answer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made a morning that won\u2019t tell the truth,\u201d Ewan said. He felt the hinge in him and did not flinch this once. \u201cI need the hurt to know where I am. You need it too, or you wouldn\u2019t be fighting it so hard.\u201d He stepped toward him. He did not raise his hand because men who raise hands in rooms like this knock things that shouldn\u2019t be knocked. He said, in the voice he used to quiet lights and Bollinger swans in the park and laddies with triangles, \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nIt was not magic any more than saying a name well is magic. It was deciding that a certain run of the world stops at your tongue. It can be the height of arrogance. It can also be a duty like tightening a jar for someone whose fingers are swollen. Blaise flinched. PC Lyle\u2019s patience had done the necessary creeping and turned in its neat shoes into action. She moved and laid a hand on his wrist and the bag-rope fell to the floor like a pet that has given up on being taken seriously. Archie stepped in with the other hand, and between them Blaise stood very still, as if he had come to the edge of a pond and suddenly seen his face in it and not liked, unexpectedly, how tired he looked.\n\nThey cuffed him, in the soft way for men not drunk and not swinging. He watched Ewan the whole time as if wanting to believe he had been misunderstood. \u201cIt\u2019s not crime,\u201d he said, not to the officer or the orange jacket. \u201cIt\u2019s care. I have been so careful.\u201d\n\nEwan wanted very much to say, I know. He did not say it because there are kindnesses that tie the wrong knots. He bent instead and put his palms to his knees and looked at the floor until the tremor that had danced in his fingers took itself elsewhere.\n\nOutside, the wind had its own ideas and was making them known around the lip of the unit roofs. Bags in the hedges lifted their handles, hopeful, and then went down again because hope is tiring. PC Lyle led Blaise out with a light hand. The boy was on the kerb with a carton of juice a council lad had found in a box\u2014the box said MILK on the side as if anything in this world stayed what you named it. He looked at Blaise with a betrayal that wasn\u2019t his own, and then at Ewan, and then at nothing, which was sometimes the kindest place to look.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Archie said, brisk, as if time had tugged his sleeve and reminded him it had other children to attend to. \u201cWe\u2019ll tape up, we\u2019ll get a proper team for the inventory. Lads, leave the jars. If anyone\u2019s daft enough to open one, I want it ta be at the station where we can blame the chief.\u201d He clapped Ewan on the shoulder in a way that acknowledged there was a shoulder there that had done something and that he had noticed. \u201cYe did fine,\u201d he said, and then, because compliments make his mouth itch, \u201cYe looked sick as a dug for a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d Ewan said. He straightened. The light outside had gone the colour of thin tea. Bennachie lay behind the retail units as solid as irony. The harebelles in a crack by the loading bay nodded as if they agreed with him. \u201cIt\u2019ll be worse later,\u201d he added, and wasn\u2019t sure if he meant for Blaise or himself or the bags that now had no conductor. He touched his own coat pockets and found, as he always did, nothing in there that would pass for courage if measured by others, only the tatters of what kept his hands from loving too much the idea of closing.\n\nMhairi had been going around in the background like a quiet parent, undoing small knots and making small notes. She came to him when the vans had shut their doors and the police car had closed the bag of its man and was sitting with its engine purring indecisively. \u201cIt\u2019s not done,\u201d she said, because her gift had always been not letting anyone think the third act had lasted more than ten lines. \u201cHe\u2019ll have other corners. Magic loves corners. He\u2019ll have made friends with wind that canna be unfriended with paperwork. Ye\u2019ll be needed to walk around this town and tell it itself again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d he said, knowing it would not really be a thing he did but a thing he joined in with all the other old women and lads and stony hills and Handel-singing daft roosters and light bulbs and rivers. He rubbed his fingers as if washing them without water. \u201cThe rooster,\u201d he said then, helplessly. \u201cHe pressed a box and it\u2014 It shouldn\u2019t\u2014 It\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all just a shape. Ye made another shape. Ye\u2019ll do it again. Ye dinna get rid of what frightens ye by throwing it away. Ye turn it ta a shelf in your kitchen where it bides and holds tea towels.\u201d She looked at the sky and made a noise that might once have been a laugh. \u201cAn\u2019 then, when ye\u2019re feeling very clever, it\u2019ll jump down and crow in your cupboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cComforting,\u201d he said, and she grinned at him with her ruined teeth and made him feel the right kind of small.\n\nThey walked away from the building. The wind came busy around the corners and discovered there was less to knock now. It tried to lift a chain of bags that had fallen by the door and failed. Across the road a woman coming out of the co-op carried a bought bag, the sturdy kind you pay a pound for and feel virtuous about. She had oranges in it. The bag sat well on her hip like a child. You could see the uses. You could see the lie sitting next to the use and choosing not to speak.\n\nBy the allotments, Moira was at her plot putting in a row of something not yet herself. She looked up when they passed and lifted a muddy glove. \u201cDid ye?\u201d she asked, and Ewan, who had never felt that good at plain answers, gave her one.\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now\u2019s a feast,\u201d she said, approving. \u201cYe\u2019ll be back at t\u2019library later? There\u2019s a lad will want that birth notice ye found.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put it aside.\u201d He started to turn and then paused. He took two steps back. \u201cDid you ever see a cockerel with a plastic tag on its foot?\u201d he asked, a question that had percolated up from some sunk corner of him.\n\nMoira squinted. \u201cOn wee bits farms, aye, they tie foolish things to birds. Ye\u2019re no meaning one o yon numbers for fancy breedin? My uncle glued a wee sat-nav to a pigeon once; it went to Forres and stayed. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo reason,\u201d he said, and meant the opposite, but there was a limit to how many reasons a morning would hold without splitting.\n\nHe made his way home by the path that skirted the river and gave the water its say. It spoke in the old dirty manners of rivers, dragging itself over stones and pretending it had never been in a jar. On the bank a bag was snagged that had printed on it a drawing of a tree and a promise of carbon offsets, vaguely religious. He stooped. He shook his hand once, sharply, the way his grandmother had taught, and the bag went to sugar and fell like blessing or ash.\n\nIn his kitchen he put the kettle on because you could always do that. He took the pieces he had cut the night before from under the legs of table and chair and window and door, because they had served, and he burned them and said nothing over them. The smoke the plastic did not make was the kind of miracle no one writes down.\n\nAt the library, the third light flickered as he came in and steadied as if it had heard news. The old woman with hands like paper sat by the window, not reading. He went to her and said, because courtesy is a charm, \u201cGood afternoon, Mrs. Bruce. Will the light do for ye?\u201d and she said, \u201cIt will if it\u2019s told to,\u201d and he put his palm under it as you do under the chin of a small dog.\n\nThe schoolboys came at four and swore at triangles with zest. He told them triangles were older and more patient than any of them, and they agreed to disagree with handsome sinners\u2019 smiles. The births column gave up a tiny name under G, and Ewan put the note in an envelope and wrote on the front, for Moira\u2019s Hatton lad with cold hands and a granny who worries. He went to the back door at closing and stood in the alley, listening for bags, and heard only the ordinary rustle of the day putting itself back into drawers.\n\nAt dusk he took the long way home by the sign where the scarf hung and looked at Bennachie. The hill was unbothered. It doesn\u2019t get paid to be bothered. It held the sky up at the place where sky would have sagged if left to itself, and it did not notice the compliment; that\u2019s the way with hills. He breathed. The air tasted of damp cardboard and a little garden smoke and the metal of the bypass. Somewhere a bird made the small contented noise birds make when they\u2019ve found the exact twig that suits the evening they\u2019re having. He stood as still as a door that knows it is sometimes a window, and for the whole length of three long breaths he did not imagine a crow. Then he went in and shut the normal door that was a door and put his palm to it once, just once, as if doors needed to be told they were doing very well.\n\nWhen he woke at three, which he always did, the night lay on him like a coat that fit, and he listened to the wind test the corners of the cottage and found it did not say bag bag bag. It said, in the old way, I was here before you and I will be after, and you can borrow me for your walking. He whispered three names and the folded line of the Don\u2019s course, out of habit and out of love. He closed his eyes and did not see a bowl and did not see a cockerel and did not tumble infinite. He slept again like a man who had been to a meeting and come away with less plastic in his lungs.\n\nIn the morning there was a letter through his door without a stamp, very tidy, black ink, straight lines. He made tea and opened it and read, Ewan Calder\u2014since names are bridges\u2014thank you for your visit. They say I am Blaise. I will be called other things now. You may rest easy; I have no desire to crow. But we are not finished, because wind, as you know, makes a habit of the gaps under doors. I left, in goodwill and as proof of courtesy, a jar for you. It is outside in the hedge to the left if you stand facing Bennachie. It is labeled, as true things are. You will have to decide whether to open it. If you do, you will hear something you have mistaken all your life for cruelty. If you do not, you will live and die in sound\u2019s shadow. Consider this my apology and my boast both. Kindly, B.\n\nHe set the letter down. He did not move for a while because standing very still is also a movement. Then he went out and to the left and looked at the hedge. The jar sat in the branches like a huge cold berry. The label was neat and he hated it. He took it in his hand. It was heavier than it should be. On it, in Blaise\u2019s tidy letters, was written: COCKSPUR.\n\nHe held it. He did not open it. He stood in his small lane where the morning was becoming the day and the day would do its shopping and the wind would go to the co-op and buy a little rustle and put it in its pocket. He held Blaise\u2019s jar and he held himself, and he did not hurry because you should not hurry a hinge. He went back inside and put the jar on the table, and for once he did not speak to the cottage because there are times you keep your counsel even with the things you love. He made tea. He stood in front of the Jar as if in front of a man and said, \u201cPlease,\u201d once. He did not know to whom the please belonged, and that seemed only fair.Chapter 5\n\nHe stood a long time with the jar between his elbows and the kettle thinking itself toward noise. The label peered up at him with a small arrogance because tidy handwriting often does, and the word sat there like a thorn the paper had grown: COCKSPUR. He could have opened it there on the table as if he were a man making jam social. He could have heated a knife and slipped it under the lid to startle the seal without the little shriek lids made. He could have put it in the bin, the plain coward\u2019s sacrament, and then all day listened to the phantom of it tell him what it had been. He did none of those. He made his tea and drank half standing, which he never did, then put the jar in his coat, not inside to his heart where it might talk to bones, but in the outside pocket where a nail had once worn a worry and he had mended it with invisible thread. It sat there and made no sound because jars are not obliged to warn you what they are holding.\n\nHe took the long way to the allotments. The light came across the roofs with the kind of reluctant kindness the north does so well. The lanes had been beaten tidy by cars, and at their edges the dandelions were doing sums with themselves and finding that one head becomes a hundred without asking permission. At the first corner a handful of bags had collected like pensioners, set their backs to the hedge and talked quietly of wind in the tone of those who intend to outlive it. He shook his fingers at them by habit and they did their old-sugar trick, a snowfall of brittle that is not winter. A man pushing a buggy looked at him as if to put him in a box that read odd, and he let himself go in that box because it had more air than the one that read mad.\n\nMhairi had a saucepan on at the allotment gate, not for food, but for the comfort of something boiling where you could see it. The smell was not soup. It was rowan and vinegar and a little iron. She had a stick bound with red thread, and her scarf today had cherries on it as if to taunt any gods within reach with the thought of summer.\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said, taking him in like weather. \u201cDid ye sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jar came with a letter. He thanks me. He boasts. He does both like a man thinking himself born for a dais.\u201d He pulled the jar from his pocket and put it on her paling table as if setting a baby down where all hands could see it.\n\nShe looked and made a small unhappy mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s tidy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s folk who clean to make space. An\u2019 there\u2019s folk who clean so their head can sit without making mess. Ye can tell which by their labels.\u201d She tapped the word with a knuckle. \u201cCockspur. He\u2019s a one for word games. He kens that the hawthorn that catches your coat is called that. He kens that cocks have spurs that draw blood and make men applaud in places I dinna go. He kens three meanings and hopes ye\u2019ll do his fourth for him: he hopes ye\u2019ll think fate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think invitation,\u201d Ewan said. He didn\u2019t know until he said it that this had been the word he\u2019d been holding under his tongue, making it soft.\n\n\u201cThat too.\u201d She took the stick and touched the red twine. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it by the water. Ye dinna open jars of a man\u2019s temper under cabbages. They\u2019ve their own moods without ye adding.\u201d\n\nThey walked down past the bean poles and the beds where lettuces lay like little green hearts. At the corner the hawthorn\u2014cockspur, the old women called it when it snagged your stockings\u2014had gone sugary with blossom and now was going brown at the edges in a way that was both defeat and promise. Mhairi pinched a thorn and tugged. It let go because it knew her. She wound the thorn into the red on the stick until the thread and spike made a thought together. \u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the bend.\u201d\n\nAt the Bass the Don behaved well for once; it moved as if it had somewhere useful to be and lacked the energy to preen. The willow dripped the way old willows do when they\u2019ve given up on the idea of being anything other than explanation. Underneath, on the little bit of half-mud half-sand, a child\u2019s spade lay buried up to its throat. The river had been playing at graveyard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it at tide of people,\u201d Mhairi said, which was her way of saying not at dawn\u2014his bad hour\u2014and not at noon when everything\u2019s loud. The traffic had not started properly yet. The dog-walkers were about, and their companions went stiff-leggedly through life as if braced for a joke. Across on the Ury a heron took itself like a thought into the air and stood there because it had been doing it longer than he had been breathing.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Ewan asked, hating the plea shape in his mouth and being grateful for it at the same time.\n\n\u201cYe ken how,\u201d she said. \u201cYe just dinna prefer it. Ye ask. Ye promise. Ye decide. Ye dinna wait for the world to tell ye what ye are. Ye\u2019ve three breaths. If ye use more, the world tells ye its version. If ye use less, ye tell the world what it wants and not what it needs. I\u2019ll keep count. I\u2019ll keep ye in the river\u2019s manners. The thorn is for pricking pride. The red is for remembering blood that\u2019s not yours to spill. Ye\u2019ll open and close. We\u2019ll throw nothing in. We\u2019ll leave nowt but air behind.\u201d\n\nHe took the jar. It was heavier here, or his arm was weaker; you can never tell and it doesn\u2019t matter. The lid under his fingers had the memory of a machine. He thought of Blaise\u2019s careful twist, the love he had for lids giving up, and he refused to be gentle in that way. He put the thorn to the lid\u2019s lip and breathed out on it as on a spoon to cool porridge. He said, because it had worked once and because if a word has worked once you owe it that you try it again, \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nThe lid did its small ring and release. At the same instant Mhairi\u2019s hand came down on his wrist not to stop him but to tell him he was not alone. \u201cOne,\u201d she said, voice as calm as a religious potato. \u201cTwo. Three.\u201d\n\nThe sound came out like a hand out of a stack of hay. It had bits of straw in it. It had the bulk weight of something you expect to be thin and find is not. It was a rooster, yes, the old shape of morning, the edge of a knife tied in a knot and set on a barrel. But in it, braided in the crow without mercy, were things he had never allowed himself to notice: the small before-sound of the throat, the spring in the chest, the ridiculousness. It was a boy pretending to be a king and knowing his friends were trying not to laugh; it was a door hinge doing its work bravely in a damp shed; it was the sound of a neighbour\u2019s alarm clock through a wall who every morning at six-something cursed but got up anyway to go lay stones or take blood or draw lines straight as a creed. It was ugly and it was wonderful and it did not ask his permission to be both. It went through him and the hinge in him opened and a cool wind came and went and did not do any harm. He had time to think, This is almost holy in its refusal to be what I require, and then he shut the lid not in panic but in obedience to the rule he had agreed in his bones before he came down here.\n\nHe stood with the jar in his hands and Mhairi with her hand on his arm, and he was shaking the way you shake when you have been standing too long and your blood remembers to move. He waited for the thinness afterwards and the horrid return of the bowl\u2014the plummet, the falling. It did not come. It stood back from him like a dog told to go to its bed. He opened his mouth and discovered he could breathe without climbing over anything. He made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been an old cough leaving.\n\n\u201cAgain?\u201d Mhairi asked after a while, so very kind that he nearly told her he loved her. She pinched his forearm. \u201cNay yet, laddie. Ye dinna bring an ocean into a tea cup twice in one morning. We\u2019ll set it away.\u201d She took the red off the thorn and put the thorn back into the hawthorn as if you could return its memory to it. \u201cThat\u2019s its work. Ye\u2019ve yours.\u201d\n\nHe put the jar in his coat again. It felt less like a threat now and more like a spool of thin wire, dangerous if silly, useful if you knew where your fingers were. They stood a while and watched the water practice being itself. A man came down with a spaniel who regarded them as if they were horticulturalists interfering with the dog\u2019s rights. The man nodded in that north way that doesn\u2019t demand fairness or answer. Across the whisper of the willow leaves he could hear, faint, boys at the skate park practicing falling without breaking when they could help it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell Archie ye\u2019ve it,\u201d Mhairi said, practical sliding back into her like a drawer. \u201cHe\u2019ll scold. He\u2019ll say words that sound like forms. There\u2019ll be a word like evidence in there, and he is not wrong. Ye\u2019ll say ye had ta make it safe, ye have not yet thrown it in the river like a numpty, ye\u2019ll bring it to Lyle in a bag that does not have any devils in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d Ewan said, and lifted his face to the line of the hill. Bennachie had put a shoulder out of the cloud and was showing off its good bone. \u201cIt was\u2026 not as I thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sorrow and the saving both.\u201d\n\nNews travels in this town like water finds the low places\u2014by inevitability and by teasing. By midday three separate people had come into the library with borrowed forms of the same story. In one, the bagman had died in a fight and risen from it like a zombie wearing a co-op uniform. In another, the police had discovered that he was a genius and given him a job at the recycling centre and a badge you could respect from a distance. Mr. Graham confided behind a large volume of forestry statistics that the lad taken out had been his own grandson, which was demonstrably false as Mr. Graham did not have children and also the boy in question had hair. The old woman by the window did not speak at all, which meant she knew exactly what had happened and had decided the town would choke on its own talk and then feel better.\n\nArchie called at three with a voice that had been practising patience and now could nearly wear it. \u201cWhere are ye?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the stacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome out of the stacks and into the car park. I\u2019m outside. Your face in my window in three minutes, Calder.\u201d\n\nHe went. Archie sat with his arm out the van window as if it were July, which it was not, and wore his hi-vis with the look of a man who would have preferred armour if funding had allowed. PC Lyle was in the passenger seat with a file the thickness of a cheap jumper and the expression of a woman who has had to note down more adjectives than a person should. There was a smell of crisps because authority likes salt.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Archie said when Ewan stood at his window. \u201cDo ye have anything that belongs to the investigation and does not belong on your kitchen table?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ewan said because there was no point climbing into a lie that would only gouge him. \u201cHe left me a jar. I opened it. Controlled circumstances. Not at dawn.\u201d\n\nArchie closed his eyes briefly as if he had been a teacher too long and a child had told him they had done an experiment with the bunsen turned to Satan. PC Lyle turned a page and did not smirk, which counted as a compliment from the law. \u201cWhat label,\u201d she asked, pen ready.\n\n\u201cCockspur,\u201d he said, and had the odd sensation of giving away a truth that was not his and not the jar\u2019s, but the town\u2019s. \u201cIt holds\u2026 what it says. I opened it three seconds. With witness. It did no harm. It will do harm if kept badly. I was keeping it well.\u201d He didn\u2019t know why he needed to say the last, but his grandmother had always insisted that promises you make to yourself need to be aired where other ears can pin them to you later.\n\n\u201cHow did it come to be on your premises?\u201d Lyle asked, steady, a person who had never been to his kitchen but understood kitchens in general, which was nearly as good.\n\n\u201cHe put it in my hedge.\u201d He described the letter without saying what it had done to his hand to see Kindly, B. in that tidy ink. \u201cI have it. I can bring it to you at the station at six. It will be sealed. It is a hazard if used as a weapon. It is less a hazard if you treat it as\u2026 as a live wire.\u201d\n\nArchie grunted. His eyes had the tired you get from taking in too much civic indignation at once. \u201cJesus wept at the paperwork,\u201d he said, which was not his usual religious way. \u201cFine. Six. Don\u2019t put it anywhere warm. Don\u2019t put it anywhere very cold. Don\u2019t put it in a bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Ewan said, and they looked at each other and had the experience of two men of different worlds finding themselves for a second in a plague year on the same bench. Archie nodded. \u201cYe did good,\u201d he said, and then, as always, \u201cOnce.\u201d He drove off with Lyle making notes at his left, and the van\u2019s brake light blinked in the way of someone closing a parenthesis.\n\nAt four the schoolboys came and swore at triangles with a restored verve. They had heard, of course. Their hearing had improved miraculously in one day. \u201cMist\u2019r Calder,\u201d one said, the one with the soft half-moustache that looked as if it had been spilled by a careless god. \u201cIs it true the bagman had birds that he\u2019d trained to steal chips off folk for him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he had hopes,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cBirds have their own opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d the boy said, with all a teenager\u2019s contempt for any citizen not himself, \u201cbirds are away with it. I seen a gull swallow a bairn\u2019s hat. Like. Whole. My maw says we should just poison them. I say that\u2019s murder. But funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour maw is wrong on method and you are wrong on texture,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cGulls deserve respect for their honesty. They will steal off you to your face. Some folk make that into a career.\u201d He looked at them properly. \u201cWere ye at the garden centre?\u201d\n\nThey did their teenage mouth shapes that are not speaking and not keeping silence. One shook his head with a seriousness that touched him. \u201cNaw,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Jay was. He said the man said if they tied stuff right they\u2019d save wee birds. I dinna think he\u2019s slept since last week. He smells like the swimming pool. He said he could hear the wind talk in the bags. That\u2019s messed up, aye?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cDrink water instead of hearing wind if you have the choice. If Jay comes in, send him to Mrs. Latch at the allotments. She\u2019ll tell him a story that doesn\u2019t hurt afterwards.\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s face lit into mischief at the idea of sex in a shed because they are twelve even when they are seventeen, and then smoothed again as he saw that Ewan meant exactly what he said and not the joke the boy had thought would save them both from feeling anything. \u201cAye,\u201d he said, and bent his head to the triangle that was older than him and his father and the arguments in their house.\n\nAt ten to six he signed out and put the CLOSED sign up and made sure the third light would not sulk, and then he took the jar back out of his pocket. He wrapped it in a tea towel that had a strawberry on one corner and a burn he did not admit to having made, and he put it in the old canvas bag from a book fair that had a print of a whale on it. He did not put that bag inside another bag. He walked to the police station by the path that passes the sly shop that sells things you didn\u2019t know you needed tucked between the shoe repair and the accountants. Outside the station a hanging basket of petunias had refused to be cowed by the rest of the day and was being obscene in colour in the best way.\n\nPC Lyle met him at the door and took him into a room that smelt like linoleum and anger soaked up. She took the jar with both hands and set it on a tray as if it were a cake a child had made and you could not risk letting pride vanish if the cake fell. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, rogue sincere in her face. \u201cWe don\u2019t get this kind of assistance often.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s self-interest,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that sound gets loose in the wrong place at the wrong time, someone with my shape of magic will go bottom-up. We are not thick on the ground, but we exist, and you\u2019ll have paperwork you don\u2019t have a template for.\u201d\n\nShe met that with a look that said both, I have a template for most things and also I do not mind drawing a new one if it keeps the town from accusing me of being lax. \u201cI\u2019ll store it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll write in my file that it came to you and you secured it in company. That we did not lose anyone to stupidity this week. Archie will put his name under it because he loves forms the way other men love baths, for how they leave you clean.\u201d She hesitated and then added, with the dryness of a person who does not like to learn but likes to have learned, \u201cIs there anything else of his out there? Anything we should not put our hands in?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and thought of chalk and jars and the little nest of plastic under the table that had quieted at a please. \u201cCorners. He liked corners. He liked the wind in a bottle and never asked it if it wanted to live there. Ask the boys. They\u2019ll have the map whether he put it in their hands or in their feet. And there\u2019s a rooster in town with a plastic tag on its leg. If you can track that, I\u2019d be surprised. But men who like control like tags.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him with the new penny eyes in which respect was a minting, not a gift. \u201cI\u2019ll put it in,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if the chief laughs. He owns chickens. He thinks that qualifies him for all knowledge.\u201d She smiled then, a tiny thing that left the whole of her face unsullied. \u201cYou look better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard one,\u201d he said before he could choose not to. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a war this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a clock. We need them. Though I prefer a wristwatch.\u201d\n\nHe went out into evening that was only pretending to be evening because summertime does that, shows you the day\u2019s skull with skin still on. The wind had got bored of its new toy and gone somewhere else to find a crisp packet to flirt with. He walked past the co-op and the woman with the oranges waved her pound-bag at him as if she had read his earlier thoughts and wanted to show him how not to become a problem. Outside Moira\u2019s bakery the crumb-streaked glass had been cleaned and the sign chalked: rowies two for wan today, because language refuses to behave for chalk too.\n\n\u201cYe gave it up?\u201d Moira called through the door as she was sweeping. \u201cThe Jar? Arch says we\u2019re tae make sure folk are scared of jars for a week, which isna practical, but it\u2019s him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave it up to people who like lists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s as practical as we\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\nShe made her small wasp-frown. \u201cAye well. There\u2019s a cockerel been seeing its-self in my window. My Morven\u2019s away with it, barkin at her own reflection. If this is your doing, I\u2019ll have ye bake on a Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it starts writing me letters I\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d he said, and she laughed without meaning to, and it was a better charm than any he knew.\n\nAt home the cottage did that thing he had asked it to learn\u2014met him at the door like a dog who has agreed to pretend it wasn\u2019t anxiously waiting for your step. He put his palm flat to the wood and said nothing, and the door was good enough to accept that as language. He put the tea towel back on its hook. He put the whale bag away. He stood in the kitchen for a minute and heard, for the first time in a long time, only the house, only the settling. He went to the sink and put both hands under the cold again because he liked the way the pain told him his skin had borders. He took his hands out, shook them, and they were his.\n\nPast midnight he went to the window and let the dark put its jaw on his shoulder. The lane was a strip of small agreements: do not slam doors, do not run cars, do not sing unless you have to. Somewhere a night train shouldered its way under the town like a memory of going elsewhere. He leaned his forehead against the glass that had seen war and ration and disco and men kissing women in corners their mothers would disapprove and men kissing the dark because the dark said nothing at all. He was glad in his quiet, which he had rarely allowed himself to be in case somebody accused him of not trying.\n\nHe woke with the light that comes too early to be polite and lay counting, as he did, the work in his chest. Three heartbeats. Five. A tenth of a river\u2019s travel from one stone to the next. When the town\u2019s rooster, not close, not his, did what roosters have always done in all the towns and pre-towns since chickens were dinosaurs and saw morning with their whole ridiculous faces, he lay and he did not turn into glass. He felt the hinge and allowed it and it did not turn him; he just opened and closed and opened again like he had promised himself he would do at the river. He lay and smiled once into the dark, a brief thing, and it didn\u2019t crack.\n\nThere were new things to do. Archie sent a man round with a list like a scavenger hunt: small plastic constructions found in hedges by Danestone, a wreath of handles wrapped around the foot of the statue in the square, a child brought in a chain of bread bags like a rosary and said he had been told to carry it for luck. PC Lyle asked if he would come to a school assembly and say in that voice he had that turned tin into rope that it was fine to pick up litter but not to make art with it and certainly not to carry handles wrapped around your wrist because your blood is yours to keep. He said he would, and then looked at the calendar and remembered he had, in fact, two days a week a job that paid and included the care of the third light and a woman who needed not-reading by a window. He went to the headmistress and arranged that this was all the town\u2019s work and he could be borrowed and returned like a careful book.\n\nJay came in to the library two days after the jar and sat himself in a corner and did not speak, and Ewan fetched him a glass of water without saying that water is not a magic but behaves like one when you have given your body over to the idea that you can hear plastics whisper. The boy drank. He put the glass on the table like he didn\u2019t trust tables. He said, miserable and polite and still full of hope because fourteen is impossible, \u201cHe said we were menders.\u201d He looked at his own hands as if they were stitched on and might pop. \u201cI liked that. We were a team. Folk said we were daft. That was good. I liked being daft in a good way, if ye ken me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ken ye,\u201d Ewan said. He sat and made sure his chair was set at a notation that meant, I can get up if you need me to and I can stay if you need me to. \u201cThere are mends that tie a thing back to itself and mends that tie it to the wrong house. Ye can always tell by whether something that lived can move after. If it cannae, you\u2019ve made a cage and called it a fix.\u201d\n\nThe boy stared at him with a hunger that made him so dear that Ewan nearly swore. \u201cI keened the wind,\u201d Jay whispered. \u201cI heard it in the plastic. It liked it. It said it liked the new noise it made. That\u2019s\u2026 bad, aye?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s new,\u201d Ewan said. He thought of the jar and the silly glory of the crow and how it had refused to turn itself into a spear. \u201cNew things call themselves good to get invited in. Some are. Some are like a neighbour who borrows salt and then your car. Ye dinna need that neighbour in your kitchen. Ye can still nod to him in the street. The wind will manage. It does not need you to make it a song it did not ask for. It will be your friend if you do not talk too much.\u201d\n\nJay nodded hard enough to wobble his hair. He was, just then, terribly pure. It made Ewan want to take a knife to the world for him and cut it into pieces that would not cut back. He said instead, because the old women had always told him that a boy learns truth better if it comes in a line he can walk, \u201cYe\u2019ll paint the park fence with Archie on Saturday. In your old coat. Ye\u2019ll swear at your mates for not holding the tin right. Ye\u2019ll go home and eat bread with jam and you\u2019ll think you have saved nothing at all. That will be the most mending done in this town that day, and the wind will gossip about ye to the trees and they\u2019ll clap in their slow way.\u201d\n\nJay grinned, at last. \u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cI can do that. I can swear. I\u2019m good at swearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am aware,\u201d Ewan said modestly, and the boy\u2019s laugh went under the desk where laughter keeps its spare skins.\n\nThere were cockerels now and then. Not many; not the plague his bones had told him to fear. He saw one at the lane again, not the same bird and yet all birds contain one another. This one had duller colours and a smarter eye. It stood on the gatepost as if the post were a pulpit, and when it crowed he stood and let it pass. It did not undo him. It simply told the day what time it was, and the day nodded because the day is polite.\n\nHe went up Bennachie on a Sunday because he always said he would and often did not, and he stood at the top with the not-many other people and looked out at the way the town petri-dished itself. He thought of the felt-tip drawing with COCKPIT written wrong-headed on it and wanted to take a very schoolroom eraser to the whole idea. There up in the wind, which had a true grin in it, he took the jar from his pocket and turned it in his hands. He did not open it. He did not need to. He let the wind read the label and have its say, which it did, blowing through his coat and catching at his hair as if he were a cousin.\n\nOn the way down he met PC Lyle with her ponytail fathered by economy and a small boy on a lead of twine\u2014a relation, by the careful pride. She raised a hand in the way of professionals off duty agreeing they are still made of the same atoms when not paid to be. \u201cHow\u2019s your jar?\u201d she asked because she was the sort to make any subject comfortable.\n\n\u201cIn custody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve one for you.\u201d She handed him a photograph, a printout off a printer that had been trying to die since 2009 but refused because there were agendas to be printed. The picture showed a rooster near a skip, its foot held up as if wincing. Around the raised leg was something like a ring. \u201cTag,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t get close. Archie says it\u2019ll dine on our fingers. You\u2019ll tell me if you see it. There\u2019s a number on the ring. Looks like someone\u2019s experiment. I don\u2019t like experiments unless I\u2019m told about them first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he said. He looked at the numbers, which had the indifference of all numbers to what they have been forced to measure. He looked at the eye, which did not know of numbers. He thought of Blaise\u2019s little handheld crow, the parody of a morning, and his stomach made a private agreement with gravity that it would not be going up the hill again today.\n\nMhairi had him in her kitchen that week, which was mostly a room with a table and a wall, and on the wall hung not photographs but lists of things to pull and things to plant and underlined words like nettles, which are friends if you know them. She cut him a slice of something that was either cake or a moral in disguise and told him, \u201cThere\u2019s a place round by Kemnay where the bags are getting in frames. They\u2019re braided now and they\u2019ll want ta be curtains next. Ye ken how a house looks from the road if it\u2019s got curtains where there ought nae be? Like a lie. We\u2019ll go and take them down.\u201d She poured tea in two chipped mugs that had seen fingers from three decades of hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell the wind back to be wind. It\u2019ll sulk. Then it\u2019ll forget us and go to Orkney. That\u2019s its right.\u201d\n\nHe went with her and they found the curtains as she\u2019d promised\u2014old bags in new weaving, clever enough that you wanted to applaud and then stopped yourself because applause cements bad ideas into foundations. They cut them free with kitchen scissors and words and did not call it an exorcism. They left them in a pile on the roadside where a lorry would have to slow to avoid them, and Archie sent a van that was good at avoiding meant objects. The man driving it waved at them as if he had known them since birth, which in this town counted as probable.\n\nHe slept better even on the nights the wind tried his window. He woke less often certain he had drowned in a bowl. When he dreamed, sometimes he dreamed of his grandmother swatting him with a dishcloth and then kissing his hand as if the dishcloth were a formality she could live without.\n\nIt might have been three weeks after the jar that he stood in his lane at twilight closing the gate with its tired latch and he heard a little sound to his left. He turned and there, not four feet from him, near the hedge, the rooster from the picture had his head down and his foot stuck cocked as if it had sat too long with his weight on it. On the leg, above the spur, the ring. The bird saw him and made the throat-noise that is not warning and not welcome, the something in between that is what living is when you\u2019re not telling anyone. He held very still. He put his hand out as if to whatever god is in charge of birds and said, quiet, \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nThe bird lifted its foot, put it down, lifted it again. He stepped closer in stages as if dancing. He could see the numbers now. The ring was not only plastic; it was plastic threaded with wire, a cheap trick from a dear mind. The wire had a tag. There were letters on the tag that made his stomach scald\u2014BC\u2014because of course a man like Blaise would not be content with the world knowing; he would need everything to know.\n\nHe did not grab. He did not pounce. He did the thing his grandmother had once taught him when catching an old hen in a coop: he made himself boring as winter. He let the bird consider him and come to the conclusion that he would, perhaps, in this one moment, allow interference. He put his hand on the leg in one swift soft press and felt the scaly heat of it and the terrible smallness. He took his penknife and slid it under the wire and snicked. The rooster made a sound like a swear from an old language and did not strike him because sometimes mercy makes even a stupid creature feel clever. The ring fell. He held it up between finger and thumb and the numbers showed their ugly teeth. He put it in his pocket without looking and stepped back at once so the bird did not have to be grateful, which would have insulted them both. It lifted, not very graceful, and dropped over the hedge into someone\u2019s garden, which was a fate he would not wish on roses but could not prevent.\n\nHe took the ring out in his kitchen under the light that never sulked because he had taught it good behaviour through shame and bribery. The tag had the BC. Under that, a number that was not a number but a date, and under that, very tiny, a line that read: COCKSPUR. He made himself laugh because the alternatives would have taken the night and wrung the sweetness from it. He put the ring in a jam jar like a trophy you hope no one will admire. In the morning he took it to Lyle and she put it in a bag that, for once, he did not mind, and she did her paperwork like a woman writing a poem about drains.\n\n\u201cWhat next?\u201d Archie asked him once on the street, which was his way of letting him know the town had stopped being amused and started being concerned. \u201cHe\u2019s in remand. He reads. Which I think should be illegal in certain cases, but I\u2019m told by my better angels that it is not. He\u2019ll be out before trial if the sheriff likes his pen. Ye ken how men with tidy hair make everything look as if it\u2019s not sticky. We\u2019ll have letters to the editor. We\u2019ll have his friends, the quiet ones, saying we\u2019re hard on innovation. We\u2019ll have boys who liked the way their hands felt doing a thing neat saying we stole their Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next,\u201d Ewan said, \u201cis we make next. We go on doing the ordinary that nothing knows how to fight. We say please. We say enough. We say, will ye hold this end while I tie here. We sweep. We cut. We refuse to be impressed. We keep for ourselves the right to be astonished and not give it to any man who brings a label and a pen.\u201d\n\nArchie looked more tired and kinder than the first day Ewan had met him on a playground with a ball and the new sharp knowledge that other boys pick up and smash what scares them. \u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of sermon I can sit through. By the way, the third light\u2019s been behaving. Tell it I said thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Ewan said, and went and told it, because compliments are a type of oil.\n\nThat evening he walked by the river and the bags were fewer in the hawthorn because people had got embarrassed, and embarrassment is a decent working tool if you use it to keep your hands out of what ought not be touched. The willow had shed a handful of yellow leaves that had the nerve to fall early as if to remind them all that nothing is theirs to schedule. A woman he did not know was teaching a child to skip stones with the moral seriousness such acts deserve. The stones mostly plopped. The woman did not say a swear word even once. He wanted to give her a medal.\n\nHe stood with his back against the fence and closed his eyes, and he could hear, with the jar not in his pocket and the river doing its manners and the wind out of a bottle and back where it was meant, the town\u2019s old noises: a gull practising contempt; a door gently refusing and then accepting; far off the football pitch sucking boys into the enormous machine that turns bodies into running and then back into chatter. He thought of the rooster. He thought of the jar on a shelf in a station that smelt of floor cleaner and cigarettes that men lied about. He thought of Blaise sitting in a room with a man making notes and deciding whether to be charming, whether to be sorry, whether to insist that the word he had been looking for all his life had been tidy. He thought of himself at ten falling into a bowl and coming up years later with river in his ears and swearing he would not listen. He thought of Mhairi\u2019s thorn, red-wound and then returned to the bush like a mistake he had been allowed to keep, and he let the day take him in where a house takes a draught\u2014a small gap under the door, purposive, useful, not to be mocked.\n\nHe went home. He went to bed. He woke before dawn to a darkness as familiar as his own worn boots and lay still. Out in the birches there was the breath the old cottage knew. Somewhere toward the Don a fox made its old sewing-machine noise. The air at his throat was good enough to drink. Far off, not near, not unkind, a rooster told the day to have some courage, and Ewan\u2019s magic, which was not a pet but a shape his life had taken, stretched like a cat and made itself large without making a show of it. He smiled once, a small thing, and the dark smiled back in its blank way. He said the three names and the folded line of the Don\u2019s course, and he slept two hours more because morning had asked; he had not told it what to be.Chapter 7\n\nThe letter came in rain, which made of its tidy ink a private weather. Ewan found it halfway under the mat as if it had tried to come in of its own accord and then thought better of it. He lifted it between two fingers so as not to give it more of his hands than courtesy required and took it to the table where all things that wanted judging sat to learn their place. The writing was that same narrow neatness, a schoolroom\u2019s pride that thought itself a virtue, and the words arranged themselves as if queuing at a bus stop: Ewan Calder, curator of quiet\u2014because I am not a barbarian, I will not force conversation upon you in person. I am, by the council\u2019s grace, detained. I am, by my own lights, working. The river dreams me. The wind remembers me. The town is a machine that will accept the proper fuel if you prime it. You primed it the other way. How clever. I grudgingly admire. There is in the world a principle that hates slackness, that wishes things to be taut and make music. We are both servants of it. I send you, not a jar, but a game. Fold any three bags into a plait. Tie them so that a child could not pull them apart. Then think of a bird and say its name backwards and blow. If you are honest, it will hum. I require nothing from you. I only wish to register that tidy is a love the law does not understand. B.\n\nHe put the letter face down. He drank his tea. He turned it over again and read the words a second time because men are not better than cats; they go back to the door to see if it holds. He felt in the room a small bristle as if the cottage had decided it disliked being called a machine, and he soothed it with the flat of his palm on the table, palms making friends with wood as they are trained to do in decent houses. He took the letter to the stove and held it low, not to burn it yet\u2014he did not want Blaise\u2019s tidy smoke under his beams\u2014but to let it meet heat and consider whether it truly wished to be in his keeping.\n\nMhairi came round within the hour because rain has a way of telling her where to go, and because the town\u2019s Rota of Worry always had his name pencilled in. He set the letter for her on the table and she read, moving her lips a little as some old hands do because words sometimes need help getting out of their beds. \u201cHe\u2019s making spells that wear gloves,\u201d she said, sour as rowan. \u201cLetters are spells ye have to hold in your very eyes, which is worse than a jar because ye cannae put a lid back on words once they\u2019ve touched the bit in ye that thinks with pictures. We\u2019ll no keep it. We\u2019ll cut it up. We\u2019ll ask the rain to take the vowels.\u201d\n\nShe was as good as her instructions. She took her kitchen scissors out of her bag as if she\u2019d been buying onions and trimmed the letter into strips, then into small beige snow which she tipped into the saucepan she\u2019d brought without explanation. The water there smelled faintly of metal and leaves. She stirred with a spoon that had seen army soup and christening broth and mourners\u2019 tea. \u201cIf ye read a spell twice, ye\u2019ve let it have a chair at your table,\u201d she said, not looking up. \u201cYe read it once for warning. Ye read it a second time for pride. Ye dinna read it a third unless ye like company ye canna evict.\u201d She tipped the wet paper into her hand and squeezed it. The strips shivered and then softened and fell through her fingers back into the pot. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the rain keep the shape o the words and let the meaning go with the steam.\u201d\n\nOutside, the rain that had arrived with the letter did its ordinary work of making mistakes look pretty. On the path the hedgerow let a bag lift and put itself down again, dissuaded, perhaps, because the air smelled of vinegar and old iron and nobody likes to rust unnecessarily. Ewan felt gratitude to the day simply because it had decided not to be dramatic. He got his coat and walked Mhairi back toward the allotments, the two of them bent slightly into the weather like pen strokes with character.\n\nAt the gate the saucepan went to a hook where odd things hang in this town so they can be seen enough to be thought about and not so much that folk begin to ask if they can borrow them. Mhairi shook her hands dry and squinted at the sky in the way of a woman who has argued with it into her seventies and knows its tricks. \u201cYe\u2019ll have folk come in with jars of their own now,\u201d she said, not unpleased. \u201cAny numpty with a label thinks himself a scientist. We\u2019ll be polite and we\u2019ll throw their wee storms back into their big ones and tell wind to go do its rightful job, which is ta move but not tell folk what they are.\u201d\n\nIt was not a jar that came first. It was a mist like a clothesline. In July the haar is a visitor from sea with manners, usually; it arrives late, leaves early, and keeps its wet hands to itself. This came up the valley wrong-footed and went down into the shopping precinct as if it had lost an earring and would not leave till it found it. Moira\u2019s window went soft, and in that soft he saw for an instant that this fog wanted to hold sound the way a jar does, keep it in to admire later. The co-op door hissed its usual hiss at opening and the sound sat in the mist, heavy as soaked wool. Out on the pavement, a boy\u2019s laugh stayed near his mouth, swelled, and then sank like the heavy end of a seesaw. Ewan did the silly thing and put his hand out into the white as if feeling for a wall; the air pressed back slightly, as if it had learned recently that it could.\n\nHe threw his sense sideways and found the police station by the feeling of forms piled up in a small space. Inside PC Lyle\u2019s tidy had gone a little mad\u2014papers out, hairline a touch sweaty, a fan on a windowsill trying to make its own weather and failing. She looked up as he came in and did not say the apology some people think they owe if they are not under control. \u201cWe\u2019ve a breach,\u201d she said. \u201cHaar, the labelled kind. The jar I took off him\u2014the one says BOUGHT AND PAID\u2014wasn\u2019t properly sealed. I had it in a box in a box in a room with an attitude, and even so it decided it\u2019d like to see your town. The station stinks like old dishcloth. Archie\u2019s using the word seep like it owes him a drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d he asked, and she pointed with her pen because pens also get to be brave. In the evidence cabinet, behind shaming glass, sat Blaise\u2019s neat cylinder with its churchgoing lid. A wetness filmed the inside like breath on a mirror. Next to it, absurd as a farm at a tea party, was the rooster machine, tagged and bagged, which had come in with the rest of the objects from the garden centre. It was off. It looked sulky about that, which was nonsense for a thing with two batteries and a speaker that would not pass muster on a cheap toy.\n\nThe mist outside pressed its face to the window as if to see how the police file their air. Ewan rests his hands on the counter and felt the grit left by nights where angry men had banged their knuckles into it and said they weren\u2019t angry. He had three breaths. He knew it. He looked at the jar and imagined he could see a tide behind it. \u201cNo dawn,\u201d he said, because it mattered to tell the day what it wasn\u2019t. \u201cNo barrels. No hedges. Just a room that insists upon itself.\u201d He nodded at Lyle. \u201cOpen the cabinet. I\u2019ll open the jar. You count. Then I\u2019ll close it and you tape it like a library book someone\u2019s loved too hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, brisk, because she was the kind of person who will count three seconds for a man and not make a fuss after. She keyed the cabinet, and the door opened with that polite kui-chink that had been designed to make burglars feel bad. The fog at the window took interest, as if sound had been looking back at it from inside and it wasn\u2019t used to that rudeness. Mhairi was not here; he had to be his own thorn and thread.\n\nHe lifted the jar, feeling the re-used throb of it, and he made his breath into a shelf on which to put what came. The lid gave like something that had wanted to get through a little door too much and had bruised itself. Lyle said, even, \u201cOne. Two. Three,\u201d and he turned the lid at the same time as she said the last, because sometimes shutting a thing is not the opposite of opening it but part of the same act. The haar shouldered out and went for the corners like a cat in a new house; it smelt of coins and laundry and old apology. It pretended to want to stay as fog, but the room with its lists and clipped-on instructions and coffee in a council mug refused to be a harbour. Lyle put tape on the jar, round and round, a ridiculous secular exorcism, and the fog sighed and decided to look out the window instead, and then decided to be weather where it belonged.\n\nThey put the jar back like a child put back into their bed and Lyle leaned on her hands and said nothing about the hollow that had appeared under her cheekbones. \u201cArchie,\u201d she said then, and that one word meant a thousand lectures, two reports and a biscuit in a wrapper half-opened and put aside. \u201cI\u2019ll write that we did what we did twice as quick as the time will say we took.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ewan said, and looked at the rooster machine as if it were a bomb. \u201cAnd don\u2019t let anyone give that to a charity shop. That\u2019s a curse-box. The first bairn who presses that as a joke will own mornings for a week and not like the rent.\u201d\n\nAfter the fog the town behaved itself with the rectangular cheeriness of bunting, and then it didn\u2019t. Moira\u2019s Morven got herself into a snare in the park that wasn\u2019t a snare, not quite; it was a dress of bread bags braided with tinsel beads to make a net that shone like a lie. The little dog, who had the temperament of a broken smoke alarm and the legs of a disgraced cutlery drawer, went in and could not find the way out because the shine confused her. Ewan was there because he goes where he sees corners that think too much of themselves, and this was a corner of air that had opinions. He picked up the net as if it had asked him to carry it over a puddle. It caught at his fingers in that small-nailed sucking way plastic learns when it has been praised beyond its character. He could not do the sugar trick here. The tinsel had made the whole into something like language\u2014a false one, the kind hyenas speak when they want to look like they\u2019re laughing.\n\nHe set his teeth in his mouth the way you do when you know someone will ask you to be more careful than your nature leans to. He looked for the motive in the motion. He found it where the two silver loops had been tied through a handle\u2014so neat, so prissy, a tie done by someone who has never taken a woven bag to the market in rain. He cut there, with a word sharp and very small, and the net lost its sentence and fell back into a basket of things it had been before. Morven squalled and leaped into Moira\u2019s arms, and Moira, who swore at bakers and angels alike when they deserved it, said a thank you that made the day clear its throat.\n\n\u201cSome bugger\u2019s trying to make Christmas with rubbish,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes like a woman who does not have tear ducts to spare. \u201cI\u2019ll set a trap o my own. A tray of sausage rolls with curses on them. See who falls.\u201d She glared at the net, now stupid on the grass. \u201cI ken a braid of good hair when I see one, and that\u2019s no it.\u201d\n\nThat night Ewan went to Bennachie again because it had not asked him and therefore he could bear it. He did not go to the top; he went to the shoulder where the wind stops telling you its important thoughts and remembers how to joke. He stood with his face ruft and counted. A crow from a distant yard; another, closer by the smallholding; a third, laughably muffled as if someone had stuffed a sleeve into a pipe. He let each into his chest and let each out. The hinge he had made of himself felt oiled and not at all like something that could trap fingers. He smiled, and on the path down he met a man with a child in a carrier who gave him the nod of a person who has forgotten that the day once came in without his permission.\n\nThe library made him a committee. He did not intend it so, but he pinned a note on the corkboard that morning\u2014Hinge Walk, Friday evening, meet at the sign, bring a bag only if you promise to take it home again\u2014and half the town came with their courtesy and their reluctance bundled together. Mrs. Bruce came with her hands like paper and a scarf that had musicians on it whose horns would have made Blaise fidget. Archie came because he hated anything that sounded like a movement and liked anything that looked like a route. PC Lyle came without her radio, which made her look naked and amused her that this was so. Jay came because being in a group where no one shouted and something got done had the new shine of a hobby he might keep. Mhairi came without explanation, with a stick tied with ribbon, and nobody asked in case saying would jinx it.\n\nThey walked the town\u2019s joints, the places where it leaned. The bridge where the river thinks about getting married to the other river and decides to remain itself; the underpass where teenagers perform the rite of complaining correctly about school; the corner by the co-op where wind likes to try on masks. At each they put their hands to stone or to metal or to the air itself and said small things that meant, You and me, we\u2019ve a deal. They took the bags they found and turned some to sugar and some to bowls around stones where the water immediately did a better job of deciding where it wanted to go. They wrote please on cards and left them in silly places like the crook of a drainpipe and the lip of a fence, and the cards were gone by morning because please is keen to be useful.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made them all druids,\u201d Archie muttered, not displeased, dragging a tangle of white out of a privet hedge with the same precision he used to pin a barrier across the road where cows had got out. \u201cI\u2019ll get grief for this if someone breaks a wrist saying gentle to a bollard.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them,\u201d Mhairi said, tying her ribbon\u2019s end back on itself to make a thought. \u201cThe town\u2019s full of noise that thinks itself words. We\u2019re putting the words back under the noise where they belong.\u201d\n\nBlaise wrote again from wherever men who are not sure if they are the villain or the hero recline to build their next paragraph. This one came through the post proper, stamped with a belief in institutions. Ewan put it on the shelf for three days and when he opened it, it tried to cling to his fingers for gratitude. It boasted that a councillor had come to see him and said interesting; it boasted that a newspaper had called him an artist because the photographs of his chalk circles printed well. It boasted that he had followers in a larger town where the river did not mind being told what it was because people there kept putting lamps into it in remembrance and expected it to accept. It asked after Ewan\u2019s quiet and whether he had learned that asking the morning to call you by your own name is the only way to stop being battered by it. Ewan read it once and then folded it and put it not under the pan but under a book about washing greens and letting them sit, because it deserved that kind of boredom.\n\nThe station called him to look at a spill. It was not of oil. It was tea, and the way of it was melancholy. The receptionist, who had lately had her hair done and would have liked someone to say so without making a fuss of it, had knocked a mug over in the evidence room. The tea had run to the boxes and the boxes, being men\u2019s, had not been sealed as one always promises to seal. The tea had found a crack in the lid marked TILL SLEEZE and had taken in what was offered, as tea will. Now the dark on the lino had the unarguable lustre of an eye. Everyone was embarrassed. Lyle stood with her arms folded and looked as if she would like two more arms and a minute away with a packet of crisps and nobody asking.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go in with bare feet,\u201d Ewan said, because sometimes the obvious is a spell. \u201cYou\u2019ll come out hating your own toes.\u201d He crouched and set his fingers to the floor near but not in the tea and breathed on it as if cold. He remembered the bowl not as drowning but as a teaching, and he let his breath be three countable things. The tea looked back as if to accuse him of pretending it had never been necessary. He said, because you sometimes have to be stupidly plain to win certain arguments, \u201cEnough,\u201d and the men in the hall who liked to shout gave up one of the words they had learned from him without admitting it and let it go. The sheen dulled. The stain remained. He made himself smile because he had learned it soothed those who can\u2019t bear a mess they forgot to prevent. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have a mark there,\u201d he said to Lyle, gentle. \u201cYou might as well make friends with it.\u201d\n\nHer mouth did that thing it did when she was persuaded to be human when she would have preferred to be a desk. \u201cWe\u2019ll put a mat over it,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody will admit why.\u201d\n\nMornings grew their legs as the summer took to telling people it was busy elsewhere, and Ewan found himself waking earlier and not hating it by law. He had the jar in his keeping no more, which pleased him, and he had a small box of cardboard circles he cut out of cereal boxes on evenings when he needed the comfort of a small sharp thing, and on each he wrote words he did not justify: please, enough, later, now, hush. He gave them away to people who looked as if their own words had packed a bag and left. He tucked some under lampposts from which men liked to hang opinions. He slid one under the foot of the third light because it had begun to mind its manners without needing to be told and it deserved a tip.\n\nOn a Wednesday the sky turned the yellow you get when weather has been told by an office to be careful and has decided to obey by being noisy. Archie called it with relish a warning, which gave him leave to be everywhere and be helpful without being told no. \u201cIt\u2019s in off Peterhead,\u201d he said, which meant nothing and everything. \u201cLoose rubbish will go flying. I\u2019ll have men out with lorries. I\u2019ll have bairns told not to kite anything that looks like it\u2019s got a plug. Ye\u2019ll be using your mouth at people no doubt.\u201d He sounded tired and pleased because there are days when his work looks like exactly the thing someone made him for.\n\nThe wind came with that mean humour it sometimes gets near harvest. It wanted to remind everyone who is in charge of roofs. The hedges that have survived a dozen winters and two bad summers bent their backs. The bag nests in the places they had not yet found spoke up in a chorus and then were torn out of their cleverness and dragged across verges and into ditches. Up by the bypass, a thing like a kite got loose from the old garden centre roof\u2014the place sealed now and taped and labeled but still with corners\u2014and made for the carriageway like a saint for its martyrdom. It was a sail of proper bags stitched at their handles and turned into a letter that the town would have to read if it landed where men drive fast. Jay saw it because boys\u2019 eyes are better when there is trouble they can be useful with, and he did the thing even good boys rarely do without flinching; he ran to find an adult and brought that adult\u2014Ewan\u2014right to it.\n\nThey were a bad team and they were perfect. Jay held the sagging of the sail by one corner and swore under his breath like someone being careful of an old china teacup. Ewan went for the knot, always the knot, and found that the man who had tied this one did not love knots for themselves but for what they could make others do, and that is the sort easiest to unfasten if you insult it. He said nonsense to it. He said ugly. He said you are not a net, you are a group project that got out of hand. He said please, at the end, because he is himself, and the knot gave up in a sulk and the sail fell on them and then around them, and then the wind, liking a joke, lifted the vast plastic sheet like a theatre cloth and slapped it into the layby, where Archie\u2019s van came as if conjured and put a wheel on the corner of it like a man pinning down a drunk.\n\nOn the other side of the dual carriageway, a crow-box crowed, ridiculously loud in its bravado, from someone\u2019s porch\u2014a copycat or a leftover, who knew\u2014and Ewan felt the hinge in him look over, see nothing that required it, and go back to its breakfast. He pressed his hands to the plastic as if it were an overexcited child and told it in the tone he used for boys with triangles that the performance was over. Jay sat down hard in the wet verge and put his hand over his eyes and laughed. It sounded exactly like relief and nothing like triumph, which made Ewan want to bless him and instead made him say, \u201cRowie?\u201d\n\nMoira had rowies because anyone with sense stocks carbohydrates when the weather means to speak in capital letters. She handed them out at the corner where the walk cut short and the older men liked to stand to see what\u2019s going. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it a festival,\u201d she said, covering the pot with a towel because towels are a kind of mercy. \u201cFestival o Taking Things Down. The things\u2019ll sulk. Then they\u2019ll forget they ever got above their station.\u201d\n\nThe wind unbuttoned the day and then thought better of it, seeing it had pulled enough. By evening the bins had bruises but the fences had not flown. Children went out to look at where things now sat that had no business sitting there and made of it a treasure hunt. Archie, whose heart preferred a neat grid, allowed it so long as nobody took the cones away from the places where men would be with trucks. PC Lyle walked with her hands in her jacket pockets and looked at everything as if she was collecting names for later. At the allotments, plants that needed staking got it, plants that would not benefit from useful help were left with the dignity of falling over on their own.\n\nEwan went home into a house that had remembered how to hold itself against a shout. He shut the door; the latch made its particular noise of I have your back. He put his hands under the cold as he had learned to do because pain, properly administered, can be a leash on lesser pain. He leaned his forehead against the window and watched the lane\u2019s own little festivals\u2014a bag doffing itself as if in apology, a milk carton wedged under a car tyre like a sulking child, the young ash on the verge dancing because it has to. He listened hard because habit is a kind of addiction, and he knew what the morning would bring; even after a storm, roosters tell the truth. He smiled, not showing his teeth, because tonight he did not need them.\n\nBlaise wrote again, as men who fancy themselves protagonists will, but the letter came folded into itself in that way that suggests the hand that folded it had nothing else to do and wanted you to know it. He left it in the hedge. Ewan saw it because the hedge had an expression and he had learned to read shrubs. He took it and did not take it in the house. He put it under a stone where rain could get to it slowly and worms at their leisure. He did not read. He let himself wonder for a whole minute what in it was meant for him and not for the writer, and then the minute was over and he went and made tea and put three circles on the table in a row\u2014please, enough, later\u2014and the arrangement was so exactly what he felt he laughed aloud and the cottage took it with the grace of old timber.\n\nThe week came back to its ordinary singing. Babies were born and had their names put under G and K and W by someone with a pen and neat wishes. The old woman by the window came and not-read and, one day, reached and put the tip of one paper finger on the glass and tapped and said, with huge courtesy, \u201cThank ye,\u201d which brought tears to his face because it meant nothing and everything. The boy Jay stood up under a triangle and announced that the shape had ceased to be rude to him, which is the kind of victory men will ruin if they name too loudly. Archie came to the library with a clipboard and had it taken out of his hand by the quiet and returned to him with a small bruise of reflection. PC Lyle sent him a photograph of the place on the floor with the stain and the mat over it and wrote under it, Mother says you never put a mat over a problem. I say, not if you forget it\u2019s there.\n\nUnder that photograph he pinned, silently and without superstition, one of his circles. Hush, it said, and he did, because not talking is sometimes better than any cleverness he might wield. The rooster in the lane crowed at wrong times and right times, and the hinge did its patient work and did not require thanks. In the river, a bag from somebody\u2019s big shop came under the bridge and aimed itself for the reed bed with an intelligence it did not own. He put his hand over the rail and shook his fingers once and it failed to climb into meaning, falling away into its smaller selves. The wind printed itself against the side of the house and read itself there like a child at a library board pointing with a fat finger at letters it knows and making them into a story, and he was content to correct nothing while the day tried.\n\nIn late afternoon one thunderhead rolled in with the petulance of a god who missed devotion and meant to make of the skylight a platform. The light in the library became a lake held in the ceiling. The third tube did not sulk; it held its nerve like a thoughtful witness. Mrs. Bruce did not budge from her chair. The lads came and asked if he had any book where the hero was not an idiot about girls, and he gave them two and a half and they said, concentrated, that would do. He filed a jar in his mind that he did not intend ever to make and labelled it UNDERSTANDING, FOR WHEN YOU CAN BE BOTHERED, and he laughed at himself because being a man in a town is like that; you are given labels and you invent the rest.\n\nHe went home with fresh things for supper and found at his gate, not on it, not theatrical for once, the rooster, which scratched the dirt with a nonsense innocence and did not look at him beyond the way animals look to see if you are about to be coarse. Its leg bore no ring. Its eyes had the worldly vulgarity of chickens and the good luck. He stood and counted his breath and then, because he could and not because he had to, he said aloud into a lane that made a habit of minding other folk\u2019s business, \u201cGood evening,\u201d and the bird flicked a bit of grit at his boot and stalked off with no ceremony at all. It was exactly the correct courtesy.\n\nAfter dark, he lay on his bed with the door open to the hall and the window cracked, letting the sound of what little rain there was sort itself. He said again the three names and the fold of the Don and the words were muscle rather than prayer. He slept and woke and slept, and in the thin hour when once you climbed out of bed to sit on the floor because your throat had been stolen by a bird and the world was too hinge and not enough door, he turned on his side and the night did not argue. Far off, a cockerel, not the lane one, not any particular one, did its opinion, and down in the centre of him something ordinary agreed without fanfare. He looked, just before going under again, at the little circles on the table that he had forgotten to put away and thought, without making a plan, that the next one would have to say sorry, and that he would learn where to place it.Chapter 9\n\nThe morning had ironed itself after the storm, crisp as a shirt your mother still insists on pressing when you come home. Roof slates lay where they always meant to, not on the pavement telling stories about gravity. In his kitchen, with the kettle finding its note, Ewan cut a circle from a cereal box and wrote sorry on it in his best small hand. It didn\u2019t look much beside please and enough and later on the table\u2014sorrier than the word suggested, in fact\u2014but the cardboard took the ink without flinching. He set it aside as if it were the kind of bread you don\u2019t slice till someone hungry sits down.\n\nA thick envelope had come from the council stamped with a logo of a stylized tree that would never, in its life, put a root where it might meet a stone. Inside there were two requests that irritated each other like grains of sand under a lid. The first was sensible and had Lyle\u2019s lean handwriting in the margins: would he attend a school assembly at the academy to talk about \u201ccitizenship around materials,\u201d which was a way to say to lads, do not carry handles round your wrists as if you are apprentices to a saint. The second was printed and aspirational and had a councillor\u2019s signature underneath and the politely deluded smell of a new initiative about it: an evening forum on \u201cTidy as Love,\u201d a public discussion with \u201cstakeholders\u201d about what art is when it\u2019s made from what people throw away. The name Blaise did not appear, which meant it had put on a jacket and gone by itself.\n\nHe put both letters under the magnet shaped like a carrot and watched them try to hold still. The cottage hummed faintly with disapproval of meetings, which it considered less honest than weather, and he patted its sill like a dog\u2019s flank. The sorry circle looked at him with the simultaneous humility and pride of all apologies worth making. He pocketed it with a small braced breath and went out because the lane required him.\n\nMoira hailed him from the bakery door, hair clamped under a scarf that had croissants where there ought to be flowers. \u201cHae ye seen the drains?\u201d she called, as if drains were a show you could buy tickets to. \u201cDown by the square. Nae running right. Archie\u2019s away wi himself and no wrong. There\u2019s\u2026 filters. That\u2019s what the lads are calling em.\u201d She made a face as if the word had got sugar in it and turned wrong.\n\nHe found Archie at the corner where the buses nose in and out and old men keep their weather inside their coats until somebody asks. The hi-vis vest made him look like a lighthouse someone had parked. He was on his knees with a gully lifter and a humourless patience, pulling up from the throat of the drain a handsome horror\u2014three braided carriers made into a bandage and fitted with a frame that had been cut from a fruit crate and tied in, clever, with bits of free municipal string. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said conversationally without looking up. \u201cHe\u2019s invented a flood.\u201d\n\nThe thing had a mind in the vulgar way of all objects to whom men attribute care. It clung, not with teeth, but with the logic of a person who has convinced himself he is helping and now will not stop. Jay stood a pace back with a litter picker and the earnestness of a volunteer who is determined to make good the phrase good intentions. PC Lyle had a map on a clipboard and a pen behind her ear and was making a list of grates that would argue.\n\nEwan crouched, breathing river and heat from the tarmac. The woven filters had the same problem as Blaise\u2019s curtain had: they were trying to make themselves into something with a purpose nobler than their nature could hold. He slid his fingers under the band and felt where motive sat, which was in the knot that bound the pretty to the useful. \u201cShy bairns get nowt,\u201d his grandmother\u2019s voice said in his head, and he said, so small the drain could pretend he hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cPlease,\u201d and then, because this was not only about asking nicely, \u201cEnough.\u201d He put the sorry circle against the metal of the grate, just under the lip where nobody would see unless they were in the habit of putting their names where they must be rubbed by other people\u2019s steps. The net went slack in a way that was not defeat so much as a decision to be heavy. Archie, feeling it, swore with relief that would have made any communion wine curdle and got the thing out with a wet slide.\n\n\u201cBairns\u2019ll think this is good civic spirit,\u201d he grumbled, not unkind. \u201cFiltering.\u201d He spat the word into the gutter as if it had a taste. \u201cThen the sky\u2019ll fall down and they\u2019ll be first to kick the council for not having gills ready.\u201d He thumped the grate back into place and nodded to Lyle. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the one by the bank next,\u201d he said, as if he had always known where every vulnerable mouth in the town lay.\n\nA cockerel crowed then from a garden up the hill\u2014real bird, not box, with the throatiness of a thing that doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s making music ancient and daft. Ewan felt the hinge open politely and close itself again without offence. He had a palm flat on cold metal, and cold metal was as good as any Psalm for a man who believed in the physics of decency. The morning did not turn to glass. It obliged, said its say, and was quiet again in exactly the way a good sentence is.\n\nThey worked along the street in a clumsy procession\u2014two lads with barrows for whatever they pulled, two old men who had seen water in war and did not mask their advice, a girl of nine holding the roll of bin bags like a scepter because she had been allowed to be useful. Archie muttered filters, filters, as if he might summon by charm the places they were. Lyle put a tick where they'd been and a question mark where the map had never been trusted. Jay, careful, pressed his heel on the corner of a bag and shook his hand like a magician\u2019s assistant when a tail refuses to come free. People stopped and watched and were not unkind about it; they do that here, admire quiet work with the sort of approval that is almost an apology for how rarely it gets done in front of them.\n\nAt the school the assembly had the smell of varnish and wet hair. The hall was the colour of sports and a little ennui, a reasonable size for hospitality and for heartbreak. Ewan stood at the front where a deeply optimistic mural had painted girls and boys passing a globe between them as if the earth were a ball that needed exercise. He held up a triangle he\u2019d cut from card\u2014just a triangle, three equal sides, the sort that has always insisted the world be precise\u2014and he saw four hundred faces lean as if they wanted it to be a trick.\n\n\u201cThree breaths,\u201d he said, and the teachers, to his satisfaction, obeyed more quickly than the students did. \u201cOut loud if ye like. In your head if ye prefer. One, two, three.\u201d The room acquitted itself of air like a choir told to begin again. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe clever word for it is hinge. It\u2019s the bit in between. Magic likes the bit in between, but so do we, we just pretend we don\u2019t. Anyone brings you a clever thing and says it will tidy the world and you don't need to think about it, you say, I\u2019ll take three breaths and then I\u2019ll act. It\u2019s not heroic. It\u2019ll make the right lads think you\u2019re a wet blanket. Do it anyway.\u201d\n\nA boy at the back crowed then\u2014because if you tell young males not to play with sound, you make it delicious\u2014and for a moment the room trembled as if it intended to be an arena. Ewan put his hand up not to silence so much as to tip the room back into itself. \u201cAye,\u201d he said, \u201cbird says morning. We do not put it in a jar for later. We do not make dresses out of the mess and pass them round as if we\u2019ve invented fashion. We get up. We go to school. We do our three breaths. We pick up what we dropped. We dinna make nets that catch what never hurt us.\u201d\n\nJay stood to his feet without meaning to and in that motion there was the whole reason adults put on ties and ask boys to sit still. \u201cHe said we were menders,\u201d he called, because there\u2019s no point pretending a shared mistake isn\u2019t excellent company. \u201cHe said the wind liked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd wind will always say it likes whatever it\u2019s just been given,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cIt\u2019s greedy, wind. It\u2019ll say it loves a new noise because new is tasty. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t take wind\u2019s first opinion. You take your three breaths. You listen to your gran. You ask the river if it would like to swallow what you\u2019ve braided for it.\u201d There was a ripple of laughter for river as if he had made it a teacher on relief, and the relief was good. \u201cIf you see a bag that wants to be sugar,\u201d he added, \u201cshake your hand and call me. If you see a net where there was not a net, cut it. Care is a knot that makes someone free, not stuck.\u201d\n\nHe pressed the triangle flat against his palm. The hall breathed because he had asked it to. He set down three cardboard circles on the piano as if he were laying out biscuits and the children leaned as they do when a trick is going to be given away and then turned into a better trick in their own pockets. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, tapping the first. \u201cEnough.\u201d He put his fingertip on the second. \u201cAnd this one, you\u2019ll hate it, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s soft, but it will save you when you have done harm because any human does, and it\u2019ll save your pal when you mean to be good and you were not. Sorry. Not the cheap kind. The kind that says, I did it, I won\u2019t do that one again, and I\u2019ll fix what I can. That third word is a grown-up. Nobody wants to adopt it. But if you carry it, the world will lend you its arms when yours are tired.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, at the forum in the Town Hall with the stack of metal chairs and the carpet that remembered the feet of mayors, the councillor with hair that believed in combs did his best with tidy as love. He used graphs and pictures of bins smiling, and he did not say the word Blaise, which meant he said it more than he intended. In the row behind, two women who loved their gardens with violence nodded when he said community art, and the man from the paper sharpened his pencil with a knife whose blade had been polished on a lifetime of meetings. Lyle wore a dress under her jacket that looked like she had reluctantly bought it and then had grown fond of it because it did as asked. Archie, who had no intention of speaking, had been given a roving microphone and held it like a man who would rather hold a hammer and yet could not resist the weight of it.\n\nMhairi did not sit. She stood at the back with her basket and her scarf tied tight under her chin and looked, as always, like the warning at the end of a fairytale that the children only half hear because they\u2019ve been sent to bed. The councillor opened the floor. A man with a voice like a clean desk said he had been to Glasgow and seen installations made from plastic bottles that made him feel uplifted, and a student with fringe and opinions said art should be allowed to be naughty if it taught, and then a woman Ewan did not know said her wee spaniel had come home with a necklace of rings and she had thought him cute until the vet told her the word embedded.\n\n\u201cYe can make each other uncomfortable with your clever,\u201d Mhairi said into the space between the microphone being offered and her disagreeing with its existence, and the words went to the far corners of the hall the way chickens do when a shadow passes. \u201cBut you dinna tell a river to agree with your art. Ye dinna tell wind what noise it makes. If ye tie a knot make sure whatever ye\u2019ve tied can walk after it. If it cannae, cut it. Leave your tidy to your drawers and your mind, not to the throats o birds.\u201d\n\nA boy near the front pressed something in his hand out of mischief or loyalty, and the crow-box in his jacket pocket gave a cheap shout. The sound was thin, the way a brag dwindles when faced with someone\u2019s grandmother. It raised the hair at the back of Ewan\u2019s neck as old voices do. He set his shoulders to the hinge and let the cheap morning go through and out. There was a murmur in the room like the beginning of a hymn, and Mrs. Bruce, who had surprised everyone by being there, hummed Cwm Rhondda under her breath like a floorboard that knows its tune. The little device sulked as objects do when ignored properly.\n\nThe councillor made his resolution with treacle and care: that there should be evenings of untying for anyone who wanted to make their hands honest; that drains would be checked in the kind of rota that pleases a certain type of man so that the rest of us can forget what the word gully means; that young folk who liked the feel of weaving would be given bales of old rope and told the correct, ancient, useful knots to make, and someone, not Ewan, christened the project Hush Rope, which made the room pleased and awkward and willing. Lyle stood, mercifully brief, and said harm was harm even if you had a label, which is all the law can say when the town wants to be romantic. Archie said a word about responsibility that was less a word than a look. The student with the fringe waited afterwards to say that he had thrown his crow device in a bin, which was polite and not enough, and Mhairi, who had seen more bins than most, said, take the batteries out first, son, and the boy looked grateful for being given specifics.\n\nHe walked the long way home because after talking plain you should let your words lie down in the grass. He stopped at a gate he had not touched since the day of the Tupperware, and his hand did what it had wanted to do in the memory and hadn\u2019t\u2014rested there, flat, respectful as if on a forehead. The Knoxes were in the yard with their hands where all good hands are in the evening\u2014on small wood and stubborn hinges. Mrs. Knox, headscarf in a print of strawberries that had usurped the season, waved. \u201cWe moved em last month,\u201d she said, before he could say anything. \u201cThe birds. Ye dinna need to walk the long way now if it\u2019s just that. It was nae bother.\u201d She said it in the tone of a woman trying to make a kindness small enough that it can be received.\n\nHe stepped in with the gait of a man who has come to ask a thing he cannot ask without also admitting to the shape of his fear. The cockerel in the yard was a handsome idiot named Rab\u2014Mrs. Knox told him with a pride she would have been ashamed to show about a son. Rab had a smutted comb and the look of a creature whose brain is busy as a pea rolling in a cup, which is to say busy enough. He strutted, as all roosters are condemned to do by something the priests probably named pride, and he did his morning even though it was evening because chickens do not own watches. The sound came out with the scaffolding showing and the ridiculous lilt and the old necessity, and Ewan stood about two yards from it and put his hand\u2014just to say he was here\u2014on the door of the coop. His hinge opened and closed. It did not try to take the whole day in. It was content with three breaths. It was, he realized with a jolt that left beauty behind like a found coin, not an enemy. It was a clock.\n\n\u201cI came to say sorry,\u201d he said to Mrs. Knox and to the bird and to the air and to the boy he had been who had tipped a bowl into panic and never forgiven the morning for having a throat. \u201cI\u2019ve made ye into a god I cannot meet. It\u2019s only noise. It\u2019s only the time. I\u2019m learning my manners.\u201d Mrs. Knox looked at him with the practical love good women have for men who are late to their own truths and patted his arm with the hand that has fed dogs and babies and uncooperative men. \u201cAye well,\u201d she said. \u201cYe\u2019ll come for eggs then. That\u2019s manners enough.\u201d\n\nThere was plastic twine on their fence, the bright orange kind that insists on itself like a shout, so he asked if he might remove it and she said, relieved, that she had been pretending it did not make the apples anxious. He worked with his penknife and with the rhythm of a man untying the world out of a habit that will never stop. He replaced the twine with a length of rope that had come from the first Hush Rope night\u2014good sisal, scratchy with honesty\u2014and heard the fence ease. Inside the coop he tucked his sorry circle onto a nail, hidden, silly, reverent, and Rab, confounded, pecked at his boot with a conversational sort of insult. It was exactly the right absolution.\n\nLater, at the allotments, Mhairi had her stick laid across her knees and a rowan sapling in a pot she had acquired in a way that had not involved asking for a receipt. \u201cFor the place we took the thorn,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing taken stays taken if we can help it.\u201d They went down to the bend and found the hawthorn in its politer mood, the blossom gone, the berries thinking their red into being. They planted the rowan legal and not, with a spit of earth and a blessing too plain to note. The sapling\u2019s leaves had the new green that is never very long. \u201cI stole that lad\u2019s bowl once,\u201d she said, while they patted soil where roots would persuade themselves to be. \u201cYour gran. Did she no tell ye? We were fourteen and immortals. We took her east-water and poured it just to prove we could. The morning had us for a month. We missed the bus to school and the bus to sense. That\u2019s why she hit ye with a cloth that time. She knew the flavour o drowning in a teaspoon. She wasna punishing ye. She was asking the day to give ye back.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because the hurt and the help were knotted and there was no teasing one from the other without cutting the rope. The rowan looked like belief you could put your hand on. He promised it, ridiculously, that he would do his part of the compact and not ask it to do more than its leaves could hold. Mhairi\u2019s breath came short after they\u2019d pressed the earth and he found himself fussing, which she accepted in the way of a woman who knows there is pleasure meant in it. \u201cI\u2019m tired enough to let ye,\u201d she said, mock-virtuous. \u201cDunnae go soft. It\u2019s nae flattering at my age to be treated like a glass that thinks itself crystal.\u201d\n\nThe forum had left the town taut and then softened; that was the way with talk. Hush Rope nights grew into the sort of thing you can put on a calendar without the town mocking you. Children learned to tie bowlines and told their mothers what a marlinespike was and won the right to say it in the house. The drains, bored of drama, lay with their mouths open and were not fed. Someone hung a length of braided old feed-bag rope across the mouth of a gap in a fence where a child would otherwise be tempted to fall, and Archie wrote an email with one less swear than he might have used to thank them. PC Lyle came to a Hush night and tied a knot so elegant you would have mistaken it for a jewel if you didn\u2019t know better, and when someone clapped, she bore it as if clapping were a misdemeanor she would let slide this once.\n\nBlaise went quieter. His letters still came, folded into origami of their own significance. Ewan did not read them. He learned to feel them from the other room the way a dog knows the sound of his own name in the mouth of someone who means to ask him for tricks. He slid one under a potted geranium because plants like drama if it\u2019s at the right distance, and promised the cottage that when it was time to burn paper, he would make a festival of it.\n\nOn a Friday the flat light came back with its old Highland thrift and he set out toward Bennachie with his usual comfort\u2014early enough that the day could be had for company without being made to sing. Halfway to the corner where the scarf hung on the sign, he stopped because the world had offered him a gift he was not good at accepting: stillness so complete it was not a silence but an agreement to tell the truth. The river went about its business as if he were not there. The wind had taken itself to the hill and was laughing there with the rocks like old men at a funeral who can\u2019t help themselves. In the hedgerow, a bag had gone, or been made, to be a flower\u2014you could see the care in the way the handles had been twisted to a calyx. It tried, even in stillness, to suggest it would be beautiful if only you softened your eyes. He put his hand out and shook his fingers once, and the effort left it like a sigh leaves a child who has decided to sleep after all.\n\nAt night he left the window open that inch the cottage and he had agreed was enough. He lay as he did, counting the hinges in him instead of sheep. Somewhere, maybe at the far edge of the Garioch, a rooster took up his part. Ewan opened and shut and opened again, and in the gap he remembered to ask for nothing clever. He thought of the card on the table waiting for its moment, and he thought of to whom he would give it. He thought of Mrs. Knox, of Jay, of Archie, of Lyle, of Mhairi smiling like a ruin that refused to be picturesque. He thought, for the first time without bitterness, of Blaise in a room with white paint on it making neat pen marks on paper and putting sentences in a row like tins on a shelf. He thought, because he had learned the trick and because he had finally stopped thinking it showed weakness, of his own name said back to him by morning in a tone that neither mocked nor begged and called it good.\n\nIn the morning he put the sorry circle in his pocket and walked down to the water and pressed it under the rail where the lads sometimes leaned to spit their talk into the river. He said nothing out loud because sometimes the river is not in the mood for your voice. He stood a long while at the Bass, the two streams making their agreement the old way, and he did not ask the day to be better than it meant to be. He did not ask to be forgiven. He offered himself up instead like a man at a threshold who is decent enough to wipe his feet. Beyond the willow a heron made its patient line, and then, righteous as a line can be, lifted into the noise we insist on calling sky. He watched it, and when he went back to the library the third light, unasked, did its job. The boys came for triangles and argued with him about whether shapes can be fair. Mrs. Bruce tapped the glass once, a punctuation. The door breathed. The town went on tying and untying itself.\n\nAt the end of the day, with the notices set in their pockets, he found under the mat a thin envelope without pride. He did not take it in. He opened it on the step and let the lid of the world be the table. Inside there was a scrap, not neat, torn from a page that had lost its margins. The writing was still Blaise\u2019s but a little tired at the edges, as if a man had written without a ruler, which encouraged Ewan for no reason he could name. It said only: do you still think the morning is unkind. Under it, a blot where the pen had hesitated, a little human.\n\nHe held the paper so the light did not make more of it than it was, and for once he had the right answer ready before the question could whisper him into thinking it needed a speech. He took out a circle, not sorry, not please. He had made a new one that week in a moment of kitchen hubris and not regretted it since. He wrote the word on the back of the letter and slid it under the mat where Blaise\u2019s polite theft had left a space. Enough, it said, and for the first time he felt the word not as a stop but as a completion. He shut the door and the latch made its old faith statement. Out beyond the birches someone\u2019s rooster, generous fool, did his duty, and in his bed Ewan\u2019s laugh, a small breathy thing, was accepted by the dark without charge.",

                              "content": "It began with the cockerel that wasn\u2019t there.\n\nEwan Calder woke before dawn to a darkness as familiar as his own worn boots and lay still, counting the beats of his heart and the breath outside in the birches. The old cottage on Davah Court sighed like a sleeping dog, settling its beams. Somewhere toward the Don there was the tin-foil whisper of wind against hedges. Then a sound rose, a thread pulled through the cloth of night, and he had to clamp his breath like a lid. A scratch at the throat of the dark. A rung sliding along an iron rail. The start of a crow, perhaps, or only his remembering of what a crow sounded like.\n\nHe lay there until it faded, then slowly let his lungs work the air again. He shut his eyes, opened them. The ceiling beams were just darker under the dark. He whispered the spell, the one he always used when dread braided with dawn: a twisting of three names and a folded line of the Don\u2019s course. He could see the river even now, even here, as if he could tip the cottage and let the water wash through his rooms and clean him of thinking.\n\nNo rooster. There was no rooster near enough to see him, Ewan told himself. It had been months since the Knoxes had moved their birds further out after he\u2019d politely asked, standing at their gate with a Tupperware of oatcakes he didn\u2019t eat and a charm tucked under his tongue for courage. They'd laughed and said the \u201cloon\u201d from Davah was affy fond o\u2019 quiet mornings. He kept his voice steady then, didn\u2019t mention the way cockerels could freeze his magic like a frost goes through a glass of water. He had gone home with his empty tub and had not shaken until he shut the door.\n\nHe sat up. His fingers were inked with the grey smuts of protest he pretended was soot from the stove. To most of Inverurie he was the quiet one, the man who worked in the library two days a week and fixed clockwork the other days, right as rain. The modest broom cupboard in the back of the library which used to be a cloakroom was his, and from that small space he shepherded the town\u2019s modest flows\u2014old book smell, light on polished tile, the sigh of the automatic doors. Sometimes he touched the spines of the local history volumes and felt the weight of names that were not gone, not really, just living in the turns between page and page. Magic moves most easily where something is half one thing and half another. This he knew. The noon hour and midnight, the river bend at the Bass where Don and Ury for a moment do not know which way\u2019s east.\n\nHe swung his legs out of bed. On the table he had done his night\u2019s work, the beads and knots and two empty jam jars. He tightened the knots, thumbed the beads, and muttered another little set, more habit than need. The cottage tried very hard to be ordinary for him. He had painted the kitchen a municipal cream. There were postcards of Glasgow and Lerwick on the fridge with magnets shaped like carrots. In a drawer, three pieces of meteorite hidden among teaspoons. On the sill, six pebbles that looked like nothing much under their skin but, if you turned them under a certain light, would show you the underside of the morning.\n\n\u201cBide, then,\u201d he said to the room. He had never liked people who spoke to houses, but his cottage was older than anyone in his life; it seemed churlish not to greet it. He dressed, washed, and went out to the lane.\n\nHe always went to Bennachie with his tea. To look at it from Garioch Field, or from the little rise by the allotments, or from the corner where the Inverurie sign stood and someone always hung a football scarf. Bennachie had been there before he was, before his grandmother and her grandmother\u2019s headscarf. The hill was a baked loaf of stories everyone kept breaking bits off. This morning it sat with its shoulder hunched under a dull-red sky, waiting, as things that are stone wait: patient, watchful, sad and not sad.\n\nEwan sipped, standing in his coat, and felt the shape of his day lock into place. Monday: library. Archives first. The old woman with hands like paper, who liked to sit in the morning light by the window and not read. He would make sure the third light on the right worked; if the bulb flickered she got angry and it got through into the rest of him. Then the schoolboys, two of them, who came after classes to sit at the computers and swear softly at geometry. He could handle children, most days. They tended to accept magic without noticing it was magic, which was the best sort of acceptance. Adults had to put the acceptance somewhere, and where they put it was usually unkind.\n\nSomeone called, \u201cMornin, Ewan!\u201d and he turned.\n\nMoira Fraser from the bakery was walking her dog, who was so bad-tempered and small that Ewan never understood how a creature could hold that many contradictions. Moira waved with the hand not attached to the dog. \u201cYe were up early. Ye\u2019re like a crow yerself, aye? First light and away.\u201d\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Ewan said. His voice had a fixed shape he put it into when he went out. It set accordingly, like jelly in a mould. He smiled. \u201cI\u2019m fine. And you?\u201d\n\n\u201cFine enough.\u201d She stopped near him, tugged the lead to make the dog halt too. The dog did not halt. It quivered in place like a machine tries to hum loose. \u201cListen, ye work at t\u2019library, aye? We\u2019ve a lad from Hatton says the newspapers o\u2019 last year went walkabout. He\u2019s one for the births column. Can ye look?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll check.\u201d He would check anyway. The archives had a way of rearranging themselves around people\u2019s wanting. If someone desired, truly desired, to find the notice that confirmed a life begun, the folders loosed it like a hen letting a chick out. If someone wanted to confirm a death without wanting to feel anything about it, the papers hid what was needed among old recipes for stovies and parish notices from nineteen sixty-two.\n\nMoira shifted, then looked off, then back. \u201cYe heard o\u2019 the Bagman?\u201d\n\nEwan blinked, because he had a thought like two flints tapping. Then it was gone. \u201cThe what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bagman. A daft thing, it\u2019s just the bairns. They say there\u2019s a man collects a\u2019 the plastic in the town. Not ta collect like ta put in bins. Collect like\u2026 keep. They say he lives in th\u2019 auld garden centre down by Thainstone where it\u2019s shut, and the wind there makes a noise if ye stand and listen. A rustling. Like thousands o\u2019\u2014well, bags. They say he fills them with\u2026 something. It\u2019s just foolishness.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust foolishness,\u201d Ewan agreed. His mouth kept the same friendly line. But he felt the flint again; this time a small spark jumped from it and landed somewhere damp in him. His heart did its business. His tea steamed. The sky had started to thin. \u201cI\u2019ll look for your papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye. Thanks.\u201d She tugged again. \u201cCome on then, Morven, ye halfwit.\u201d The dog, who was named for a mountain and barely came up to Ewan\u2019s ankle, yapped without conviction and continued her important business of walking.\n\nEwan stood awhile longer and watched how the heather was darker on Bennachie\u2019s cuts. Plastic bags. There had been more. The town had never been clean\u2014no place is, not really\u2014but lately there were the white ghosts of supermarket carriers in every thorn bush. You\u2019d see them staked into the hedgerow like flags of surrender. On windy days, they\u2019d lift and snap. On still days they\u2019d droop. He had felt, the last weeks, that the wind had a note in it he didn't remember from winter. A rustle. A hiss. Like the ghost of rain.\n\nHe took the side path to the library because the main road went past the smallholding where there was a cockerel. It was not an old bird; its crown was bright and gay and too big for its narrow skull, and when it crowed something in Ewan ran to the edges and tried not to fly apart. It wasn't only the sound. Sound can be blocked. It was the shape of what the sound did in the air, a sort of hinge the crowing made and opened, and at that hinge point certain spells lost their grip. The first time he learned this was when he was ten and his grandmother let him try the water-bowl charm. You set a bowl in the yard, facing east. You fill it with water from a jar you filled from the river on a night when the moon was still a fingernail. You do not speak above a murmur. You breathe on the water, and you will see for three seconds a thing you will need to be shown. More than three seconds and you would be made ill for a day and unfit for any work. Ewan had done as he was told; the bowl had taken his breath in, and then, as if cued, the neighbour\u2019s rooster announced the morning. The bowl turned opaque. For a heartbeat he saw himself fall into it, nothing but falling, a lad with a fringe and no sense for balance. He couldn\u2019t look in water for a year without feeling he was going under, and he could not thread a charm for months because the crowing lived under his skin and drummed through the work like an impatient stranger. A therapy of sorts: his grandmother swatted him with a dishcloth and said he would be all right, and he was, except when he wasn\u2019t.\n\nAt the library he paused, fixed the third light. It winked and then shone. He said good morning to the others. He checked the box of bookmarks and slid a hand under its cardboard floor to touch the little charm stuck there like a playing card. He breathed, and the room breathed too.\n\nThe archive was colder than the rest of the building. The lamps fossilized the dust motes. He checked the local papers for Moira, and while he was reading the births list and finding wee ones named after saints and footballers, a line of type caught him: environmental complaint filed by the River Don Trust regarding increased non-biodegradable waste in the Ury tributary.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everywhere,\u201d Mr. Graham said cheerfully from the doorway, startling him. Mr. Graham came to the library daily, mostly to talk. He dressed like an academic left out in the rain. \u201cPlastic, I mean. I found a Tesco bag in a gorse bush up by Oldmeldrum last week. Up near the top. How\u2019d it get there? Gorse doesn\u2019t shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWind,\u201d Ewan said.\n\n\u201cAye, but when did wind take to shopping at Tesco? Wind should be shopping at the co-op at least. Support local business.\u201d Mr. Graham smiled as if to excuse the world. \u201cYou look pale, lad.\u201d\n\n\u201cEarly,\u201d Ewan said. He handed the man his reserved book. The title had a lot of words and the words were mostly longer than the man liked. He took it anyway, radiant with good intentions.\n\nWhen the morning had slid into the hour where the coffee smell is as much hope as drink, Ewan went to the back door to step out, and there, in the alley, a bag moved with no wind to move it. A thin, clear carrier of the kind you get at the veg stall. It lifted a corner. It folded like a bird, if a bird were ashamed of its spine. The alley smelled of bins. There was no other movement. The bag rustled to itself, a whispering from inside the plastic like a person under a blanket practicing their lines.\n\nHe looked at it long enough that someone coming with returns coughed to get by him. He made himself step off the threshold and pick up the bag. It did not fight him. It lay on his palm, even limp, as death looks, and he could have balled it and shoved it in his pocket and let it live under a chair forever. He did not. He laughed a little, because laughter is a charm if you do not mean it.\n\n\u201cBack ye go,\u201d he said. And he shook his hand the way his grandmother had taught him to shake nettle sting out of the skin. The bag shrank. It did not vanish\u2014he had no interest in vanishing anything that looked like that; vanishing is not the same as mending\u2014but it went small and hard and cracked like old sugar. He dropped it in the recycling bin, and it clinked.\n\nWhen he went back inside the library, the fluorescent tube nearest the information desk squealed as if someone had trod on a mouse. He put his palm flat under it, and it stopped.\n\nEvening. He came out in a fine rain and walked down the lane toward the river because he often did, and the river did not look back in the way that some people did. By the Bass the teenagers were exhaling their gossip. He took the path under the willow where the ground smelled like roots and never quite dried. A man in a waterproof was throwing something into the water and hauling nothing out. The willow leaves touched the water and recoiled. Out past the branches, a skein of white caught on a submerged twig. Bags, three, four, two cabled together, their handles tightening like belts.\n\nEwan leaned and let his hand hover over them. A tremor ran up his wrist. The bags had something in them, and it moved, slow and homely as old hair. He grimaced. He should go home. He should let Archie freakin Young of all people, who wore a hi-vis vest and managed the town\u2019s less dramatic emergencies, deal with the tangles that needed cutting. He couldn\u2019t.\n\nHe stepped into the shallows in his boots, winced as the water invaded them, swore on the breath not in any language you could print, and reached for the nearest handle. The plastic bit his fingers, not sharply, but with a weird suck. He pulled, and the handles pulled back\u2014not strong, not as if someone held the other end, but as if they were swelling. He had an instant\u2019s picture of the town full of swollen bags, all the bags, gathering their own breath and producing something like language.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d he said out loud, and the syllables scraped his throat going out. He shook the bag hard. He felt a snap. The rustling went thin, thin, then snapped too. He dragged the first bag free and threw it on the path. The others held. He looked at them and saw the charm: not a charm done neat with cords and notes and proper binding, but a hack. A lash-up. A taking of how wind moves and how water would like to carry and a brisk little knot tied with fingers that did not have patience for smallness.\n\nEwan bent and cut them\u2014at the place where movement meets motive, the bit in between, a place you can put a word if you know which word. He cut a few. The rest slid away and sank. He stood with water in his socks and stared at the bag on the path. There was a logo on it from a garden centre that had closed two years ago: a tree with an impossible canopy made of tiny plastic leaves. The handles were stiff as regret.\n\nHe heard it then, faintly. Not a cockerel. No. He would have known that; his skin would have cringed and his stomach climbed his spine. This was the sound of many, many thin things rubbing, as if somewhere nearby a man had set himself a task of folding and refolding every bag he found, and had decided that folding was too tidy and refolding back to crumple was better. The noise lurked in the hedges, hissed in the verge. He could not tell if it came from one place or all.\n\nFrom the bend above the path, a man came down with a fishing rod over his shoulder. He had a face that smudged when Ewan tried to pin it, like a chalkboard written on and wiped halfheartedly. He wore a cap with no badge. He shifted his rod to his other shoulder as he met Ewan and nodded. He looked past him at the bag by Ewan\u2019s foot as if it were just a bag. His eyes were the colour of plastic when it\u2019s white and thinks it's clear.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll watch the path,\u201d Ewan said, surprising himself because he never addressed strangers first. The man said nothing for a heartbeat, then smiled in a way that did not advertise teeth and said, \u201cAye. Watch my path. Good night.\u201d His accent was local and not local, a good copy a fraction too well rehearsed. He went on and the bag sound went with him.\n\nEwan picked up the garden centre bag and shoved it into the inside pocket of his coat. He regretted it as soon as he did it. He felt as if he had invited something rude into his jacket, and now it sat against his chest, whispering. He tried to shake it off. He walked home the long way, cutting across streets where the hedges were tidy. When he reached his front step he put his hand to the bag through the cloth and said, \u201cQuiet, now.\u201d\n\nIt did not quiet. All evening the bag talked. He set it on his table and wrote letters around it. He composed a line to his grandmother\u2014if she had been alive; she wasn\u2019t; she\u2019d have told him to get over himself and get a thicker coat. He ate cold oatcakes. He stared at the bag and thought of the man with the fishing rod and eyes the colour of plastic. He eventually slept with his hand pressed to his stomach, and dreamed that he lay on a bed of leaves that were not leaves but the thin white ones printed to look like leaves, and that his breath fogged inside a clear sack, harmless and terrifying, and that somewhere, beyond a wall of crinkling, a rooster stood on a barrel and announced itself like a king.\n\nMorning again. He placed the bag under the sink beside the compost bin, because that seemed like an insult to it and he liked to test the manners of things that had too much self-regard. He went to work. He mended a clock. He told the schoolboys that geometry was older and better than any of them, and that the triangles were not the problem; the problem was that they were boys. He took a call from Archie who said, \u201cYe hear any chat about folk putting bags in the river? Been complaints.\u201d Archie was a bluff man who wore his hair like a helmet. He had been unkind to Ewan once in school, and boys who are unkind make men who think they are being kind when they are not.\n\n\u201cBags,\u201d Ewan said.\n\n\u201cAye. Bags.\u201d Archie snorted. \u201cAs if there\u2019s not bins enough. Anyway, ye ken what folk are like.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep an ear,\u201d Ewan said, and hung up without meaning to be rude.\n\nAfter lunch he took the bus toward Thainstone and got off two stops early. He walked among the half-abandoned retail spaces whose wildflower beds had availed themselves of the shadow of discount signage and turned vigorous. The old garden centre sat with its windows blank with dust and paper. The sign above the door was gone; the bolts showed out like missing teeth. Far off near the livestock mart there was a shout and the skitter of hooves, and nearer the wind wove itself into knots among the railings.\n\nHe walked round the back. There was a door with a flaking padlock. The padlock was not locked. He pushed, and the door took the push as an offense. He stepped inside into the smell of old fertilizer and newer plastic. The light came through the high panes thick with dirt. His eyes made scabs of it and rubbed them off.\n\nIt was not empty. That was not surprising. People left things in places they thought were empty. The surprising thing was the care. Piles of bags, folded like flags. Stacks of them, colour-coded: white, cream, half-transparent, blue letters, green letters, bags with special gussets, bags with handles knotted together to make long chains. On the floor chalk marks drew circles and inside the circles lay arrangements: a star of polypropelene weaving, a spiral of sandwich bags tight as a snail shell, a grid of crisp packets like armour for a small city. On the chalk someone had written names of winds. Southeasterly. Haar. That word he recognized: the sea mist that came up from nowhere on some summer mornings and put its clammy hands on your neck.\n\nThere were jars too. Not jam jars like his. Sterile glass, labelled with tidy pen: Aisle Whisper, Till Sleeze, Parking Lot Cry. A sample of the supermarket, bottled. When he held one, a slink of feeling went up his wrist. The writing was a little too neat, and that was how he knew the man's magic wasn\u2019t good. True acts have smudged edges.\n\nAt the far end, near where the greenhouse had been, a chair faced a wall on which there were photographs taped. He went closer. They were ordinary pictures, none of them magical unless you felt what he did, that all ordinary things are magic if you are standing in a place that makes the skin thin. A shot of the river with sunlight on its wrinkled back. A disused lot where thistles had gone to white. A line of trolleys left out overnight. On the river picture someone had drawn in pen, not good pen but careful, circles where plastic gathers. On the trolley picture the word NEST had been written.\n\nEwan stood with his hands in his coat. He should not be here. He was in a man\u2019s house, though the man paid no rent and invited no guests. He should not breathe this man\u2019s air or read his handwriting.\n\nThe sound of bags rubbing went up mid-note as if its conductor had stepped onto his box and raised a baton. Ewan turned.\n\nHe did not see the man from the river. He saw something else: a structure like a curtain of carriers strung side by side, making a wall that moved because it did not understand truly what a wall does. Behind it a shadow. Behind the shadow someone\u2019s breath. He never knew later why he did not run then. The fear of cockerel would have sent him if a rooster had raised its voice. But this was plastic. Plastic only rustles. Plastic does not crow.\n\n\u201cAn\u2019 what are you?\u201d It was a question without the question mark. The voice came from behind the curtain. Ewan didn\u2019t believe in dread naming, but he felt the pull of names as a river feels the tug of bridges. You say your own name, and you\u2019re tied. You say the other\u2019s name, and the knot\u2019s in your fingers.\n\n\u201cEwan,\u201d he said anyway. Lies coil; truth often lies straight enough to look like flooring. \u201cFrom the library.\u201d\n\n\u201cLibrary,\u201d the voice repeated, and the bags said the same, a little softer. \u201cYou must like quiet. Good for you. Quiet\u2019s honest. Goes about its business. But people don\u2019t respect quiet. They clutter it. They litter it. They pile their\u2026 their crap into nice quiet, and it\u2019s up to someone to tidy. Isn\u2019t it.\u201d The last two words sighed around the room like a cleaning cloth.\n\nThe figure behind the curtain moved. Ewan saw, high up on the wall, a standard retail store clock. It ticked. It had a cracked plastic cover. He focused on the crack, on how it wobbled the second hand. He could always, if pressed, find a detail to live inside until the large shape passed by.\n\n\u201cMy name is Blaise,\u201d the voice said. It was not Blaise\u2019s name in any permanent way. Names on true people have a way of moving around until they find the posture that suits them. This name sat uncomfortably on the man, as if he had borrowed it from a book and kept the receipt. \u201cBlaise Carrid. I gather what is thrown away. I am diligent. Self-sufficient. Civic-minded.\u201d He let each phrase ripple a little in the air like a banner of cellophane.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re proud of using too many bags,\u201d Ewan said, letting the sentence fall out before the part of him with caution could sharpen it. \u201cThat\u2019s a\u2026 novelty.\u201d He tried for light. The floor tried along with him and held his weight.\n\nThe curtain lifted, and there he was. Not smudged now. His face had lines a little too straight, as if someone had drawn in cheekbones but didn\u2019t love them. His eyes were tired, which can make people kind or cruel. He wore a tidy shirt under a tidy jacket under which the pockets bulged. Each bulge rustled.\n\n\u201cNot proud,\u201d Blaise said. \u201cObedient.\u201d He lifted a pair of handles in his hand and let them dangle. \u201cThe world made these. They are here. They will not\u2026 depart. Men throw, wind fetches, river blends. Do you expect me to refuse the materials I am given? There\u2019s a call. There is a call and it\u2019s not the cockerels in fields.\u201d He watched Ewan\u2019s face change as if testing clay between his fingers. \u201cI know you,\u201d he added, softly. \u201cThe boy who can\u2019t stand the morning. The boy who tells light it is not welcome above a certain volume. I always think of you when I hear that\u2026 horn.\u201d He mimed a rooster\u2019s beak with his hand. It was an ugly little motion, but it told Ewan enough. The man had been in town long enough to learn gossip from the way people look away, or he had seen Ewan by a fence once. Perhaps he had made inquiries. People speak without wanting to. They confess in the shells of words.\n\nEwan looked at the curtain of plastic and the chalk circles and the photographs clung to the wall like limpets kissing rock. He could say the following: stop. He could say the other following thing: teach me. He could ask, and think that asking would make a rope, and the rope with a tug would lead him out. But the man\u2019s room hummed with wanting. It was a stuck kind of wanting, the worst kind\u2014the kind that is so sure its own central feeling is duty that it cannot recognize appetite.\n\n\u201cPeople will come,\u201d Ewan said instead. \u201cWith keys and torches and the right to pick up what is not theirs. If you leave it looking like this, they will come, and you will not be able to tell them an interesting story about wind. They won\u2019t hear it.\u201d He had the distinct sensation of being someone else\u2019s tongue. He was speaking, but the words had the weight of a future that had already written a paragraph in someone else\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cAh.\u201d Blaise exhaled very slightly and tipped his head as if there was a draught under it. \u201cYou worry for me. Very librarian of you. Well. The river and I have an arrangement. It feeds me. I feed it. I take what men gave it and give it back when it asks in a better shape. I make nests for wind; wind loves me. I make long handles for river; river uses them for own devices. Nobody complains when swans use our reeds. Nobody cries out when crows weave twine into their beds. Why do they call me\u2026 villain? Eh?\u201d He smiled then. It was tired, he was tired, but there was something behind it that was not tired at all. A wire. A hunger with reasons.\n\nEwan could have said: because you are lying. Because wind doesn\u2019t love men named Blaise any more than it loves glass doors. Because the kind of giving you imagine is a theft with bows on. He did not say any of that because he did not know it yet as knowledge; he felt it as ache and itch.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be here when the light goes,\u201d Blaise said, and the wall of bags sighed a little in on itself, making a poor imitation of a curtain. \u201cHens go to roost. Men with harsh torches go to their vans. Midnight is full of professionals. Go home, Mr. Calder. We could talk again another time. Take whatever fancy photographs of leaves you like with your head. The building will not board up if I do not invite it. We can let time sit between us like a sofa. You on one end. Me in my sensible seat. We both insist we\u2019re comfortable.\u201d\n\nEwan put his hand in his coat pocket and touched one of his own knots. He thought of his grandmother again, then of how the sky over the hill went the colour of fish belly when mist came. He nodded. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said, and stepped out past the curtain, which touched his shoulder and gave him a static lick that lifted the hair on his arm under his sleeve.\n\nOutside, the light looked both thinner and more polite, as if it had heard someone say it was unwanted and had resolved to behave. He walked back along the edge of the car park where grass had come up and made optimistic little nations between lines of tarmac. He thought of how Blaise had said his name. He thought of the photograph of trolleys and how the word NEST made them look like a family. Sabotage loves to look familial. He looked toward Thainstone; he could see the silver of the marts\u2019 roofs and, beyond them, the polite teeth of the bypass. He heard a far crow.\n\nHe had to stop. He put his hand flat on the bonnet of an abandoned Land Rover and breathed like a diver who forgot he had gills. The crowing was not even close, but it found him all the same. The air tightened. My magic hates this sound, he thought, and then his magic, which was not a pet but a shape his life had taken, said back, No, it doesn\u2019t. It hates what you think it means. It was an unkind answer. He stood until the quiet lapped back in.\n\nWhen he reached his own door, there was a note under the mat.\n\nEwan,\n\n\u2014 if this is the right cottage, if it is not, apologies to whomever reads it \u2014 I am down at the allotments this evening at six. There\u2019s a matter of\u2026 let\u2019s call it community tidiness. Archie says I shouldn\u2019t bother ye. Archie is often wrong.\n\nMhairi Latch\n\nHe didn\u2019t breathe again for two breaths. Mhairi Latch had been his grandmother\u2019s friend and her particular enemy when they were fifteen. They fell out, moved on, fell back, like two dogs who love in their precise brutal way. Mhairi had taught him that you can make a charm out of a rowan twig and a compliment said under your breath to the person you least wished well. He had not seen her in months. When the old hands retire they do not go to Spain; they go behind hedges and watch.\n\nHe went. The allotments were wind-chapped. The bean poles were like a village of thin people saying their prayers. Mhairi was there in her cardy, her scarf knotted under her chin, kneeling as if she were making offerings to a deity of her own vegetables. He did not know why he had thought for a second she might be gone; the woman had buried two husbands, three dogs and five ugly roses and remained herself like granite remains itself through the ages.\n\n\u201cYe took your time,\u201d she said when he came to her. \u201cI ken ye, lad. Ye think yourself going unseen like cloud. Clouds are the most seen things going.\u201d\n\nHe took off his cap and bent to kiss the air near her cheek because she never liked the feel of faces doing that. \u201cMhairi.\u201d\n\n\u201cMoira tells me ye\u2019ve got one of the Bagman\u2019s messes at your house.\u201d\n\nEwan did not ask how she knew. Things rot in gardens and go sweet again. Information does the same. \u201cUnder the sink.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye. That\u2019s as good a place as any. He likes bearings.\u201d She looked at the soil. \u201cYe\u2019ve seen him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so. He told me his name. Blaise.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong,\u201d she said immediately. The spade chopped the earth. \u201cThat\u2019s not his name. But he\u2019d like ye ta think it is. He says a thing and covers it with another thing and calls it care. He uses too many of everything, not just bags. Too many reasons. Too many excuses. Too many noises. Men like that, ye don\u2019t push. Ye don\u2019t resist either. Ye stand and watch till they walk into their own hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could stop\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAch, laddie. Men who tangle the world\u2019s leavings and make them sing in key think they can mop up a whole river with a towel. They believe their hands are bigger than they are. They go home with their hands stinging. They like the sting. If ye go to them with a broom, they\u2019ll make you into a brush.\u201d She looked up at him then, and her eyes were knives. \u201cWhy are yae shaking?\u201d\n\nHe had not noticed his hands. He looked. \u201cI heard\u2026 one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBird?\u201d\n\nHe nodded. She made a face. \u201cCockerels are fools. So are the folk who keep em outside town where they dinna belong. But mark me. They tell truths. They say, Morning\u2019s here. Ye cannae bury the morning under a rug, Ewan. Ye can draw little lines of magic across it, aye, ye can, and it\u2019ll still step over and be day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d He thought of how Blaise had mimed the rooster with his hand, that little ugly pecking motion made to hurt more than to entertain. His stomach turned the way dogs do tight circles before they settle. \u201cHe\u2019s doing something with the bags. Not only\u2026 untidy things. He\u2019s making structures. He\u2019s naming winds. He\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWent to school somewhere he thought was grand,\u201d Mhairi said dryly. \u201cThinkers who never touched a real dirty thing love to think of how wonderful dirt is.\u201d She stood up with a groan you could stitch a sack with. \u201cWe\u2019ll walk. We\u2019ll look at his wind. We\u2019ll look at what wind sees.\u201d\n\nThey went along the ditch. The sky had ridged itself like long muscle. Mhairi walked with her stick in the way of women who know exactly how hard ground is, which is very. They did not talk until they got to the place where the hedgerow turned and made a shy corner. There, caught on a hawthorn, was a net. Not rope, no twine. Bags plaited into bags, simple, elegant in its ugliness. It had faceted itself into something almost beautiful, and that was perhaps its worst offense. It had held a pheasant, which was all bones and feathers. The bones were gone now; just a fan of brown and green feathers remained, stuck on a prickle. Ewan made a noise without its own noun, and Mhairi put her hand on the net as if introducing herself to it at a funeral.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019ll expose him,\u201d she said calmly, as if reading it somewhere he couldn\u2019t see. \u201cHe\u2019ll go behind bars. That last is not our doing. That last is the job for Archie and the men with clipboards and the men who like to type. But before that he\u2019ll be at his most interesting. They always are, the moment before they are caught. They think themselves either safest or cleverest; both make good theatre. Ye\u2019ll be there, because ye\u2019re daft that way.\u201d She looked at him, and the pity in her face didn\u2019t soften it. It made it harder. \u201cAnd you\u2019re brave, which is not the same thing as not being afeart. Afeart\u2019s a good start. The heart that knows what fright is, that heart can bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so\u2026\u201d He groped. \u201cHuman,\u201d he finished. \u201cThe way it moves. The way it wants to be wanted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said. \u201cAll human rubbish is human. That\u2019s the curse.\u201d\n\nWhen he went home there was a cockerel standing on his gatepost.\n\nHe stopped where he was. Its head turned. Its eye was a button. Buttons are innocent and also not. He could not say why there would be a cockerel here, in a row of cottages where the covenants said no poultry and no midnight drumming. It shook its feathers and did not crow. He thanked it without moving for its restraint. It tilted its head further as if listening for that thanks, and in the splashed light on its neck the colours were too splendid. The world does that sometimes, sweetening the thing you fear. He felt it examine him. He let it. His palms were slick.\n\nFrom the hedge, a bag lifted and put itself down again, as if too shy to wave.\n\n\u201cI see,\u201d he said, and he did. Blaise would be the sort to use every part of a town\u2019s habits. If his spells made the wind hop at his command and the river bring him offerings, what would he not recruit? Birds were easy. They bore messages for those who wanted messages to be the kind that came with claws. He took off his cap and held it in both hands. He did not bow. He did not speak a charm, because he understood suddenly that charm was not for this. This needed something else. He thought for a long moment, then added, in his ordinary voice, \u201cYou\u2019re very handsome. I wish you a good evening. Please go.\u201d\n\nThe rooster blinked. Things often work at the point where you don\u2019t expect them to because you didn\u2019t draw a big circle round your expectation. The bird scratched once, turned, hopped off the post, and went, with all the rude grace of a creature who gives no respect to concepts, into the lane. The bag in the hedge settled.\n\nHe went inside. He put his hands in the sink under the cold tap and left them there until they hurt so well that the thought of another kind of hurt couldn\u2019t fit. He took the bag from under the sink and laid it on the table. He cut it into seven pieces, not with scissors but with a knife of words his grandmother had taught him that had never needed sharpening. He folded the pieces and set one under each leg of the table and the chair and under the door and the window and gave the seventh to the fire. The pieces did not smoke. They did not stink. He slept, and it was the first night in two days that the plastic in the air did not whisper him awake with its thousand unused syllables.\n\nIn the morning he called Archie.\n\n\u201cI have a thing,\u201d he said, not knowing yet which word he would pick for it. \u201cA\u2026 situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cYe always say that when you\u2019ve found a cat,\u201d Archie grumbled.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a cat. It\u2019s a man with a store.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it a legal store?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. Where.\u201d\n\nEwan told him. He did not tell him about the jars, the chalk, the way the curtain made a joke of walls. He did not tell him about the way Blaise had put his hand to his beak like a boy. He told him enough to get Archie\u2019s boots to the place and his lads behind. His voice was steady. It went across the phone line and did not snag.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019ll be there?\u201d Archie said, too casual.\n\n\u201cI read the papers.\u201d The dodge. The old dodge that had gotten him away from questions since he was twelve.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019ll be there. Ye should be there. Bloody witness is another word for problem, did ye ken?\u201d Archie hung up sounding irritated, which had always meant\u2014Ewan had learned this the hard way\u2014that he cared.\n\nHe put on his coat, tucked charms in odd places, then took them out again and left them on the table. He stood and looked at Bennachie through the window\u2014the hill with its shoulders shrugged against a sky that would make all its usual promises and break only the ones it did not know it had made\u2014and went out. The light was too honest to do anyone\u2019s lying for them; that would come later. He walked, and the wind, obliging, brought him the city\u2019s new music: rustle-rustle, whisper-whisper, bag bag bag, as if a crowd had learned a new word and liked the shape it made in their mouths and would say it as many times as possible before they were told to hush.\n\nOn the corner by the bus stop, Moira raised her hand. \u201cEwan! Archie\u2019s looking for ye.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll find me,\u201d Ewan said, an odd voice. He had the sensation that time had split. In one time he went about his day and came home with salt on his boots. In another time he would not come home the same. He stepped around the cockerel on the post that was no longer there but would always, in a way, be.\n\nIn the co-op window there was a sign: please re-use your carrier bags. Below it, someone had scrawled, in black, please. The second please was badly shaped, but it looked more like a prayer. He hoped prayers like that counted. He hoped someone, somewhere, was counting. He thought of Mhairi\u2019s knife eyes and Blaise\u2019s tidied jacket and the way wind really sounds when it\u2019s willing to show you its inside, and he walked, picking his way on the pavement that knows more of feet than any oracle. There is always a meeting. He went to his.",

Two other vans had come\u2014council lads with grabbers and heavy gloves, and the police car that smelled of coffee and rain even before you got near it. Ewan felt their purpose the way you feel a storm before it rounds the hill. He slowed his step without meaning to. His feet knew this was a hinge hour, and feet get to vote even if you think you\u2019re running the meeting.\n\nArchie saw him and rolled his shoulders to look taller. He wore authority like he wore his orange vest: obvious, a bit too bright, but it kept you safe in traffic. \u201cRight, Calder,\u201d he called, not unkind. \u201cYe\u2019ve the key, aye?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a lock,\u201d Ewan said. He lifted his hand, palm upward, a bodily shrug that said he hadn\u2019t come to lead anything. \u201cBack door opens if you push it as if you\u2019re apologizing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, well,\u201d Archie muttered, \u201cwe\u2019ll push like we mean it.\u201d He glanced at PC Lyle, a tidy woman with hair pulled to a point at the back of her head and eyes like new pennies. She didn\u2019t look much older than the schoolboys who swore at triangles, but her posture said she was paid to do this and also born to. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep it calm,\u201d she said, to no one and everyone. \u201cIf he\u2019s there, we talk first. If he\u2019s not there, we document. No drama.\u201d\n\nMhairi had come without being asked, as she had always come to any place there might be a use for her noticing. She had a basket over her arm, the sort you see in old pictures of women with heads for market arithmetic. She nodded at Ewan and then at Archie as if distributing points. \u201cNo one touches anything wi bare hands,\u201d she announced, as if hired to consult. \u201cNo one stands where wind can push ye without ye knowing. If there\u2019s jars, leave em be unless ye ken your jar-magic from your elbow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho invited the knitting circle?\u201d one of the council lads muttered, and Mhairi turned her head very slightly. The lad colored in a way that suggested he\u2019d been an altar boy once and still recognized certain kinds of holiness.\n\nThey walked the side of the shuttered units, past the place where purple loosestrife had exploited a crack and made itself queen of an island of gravel. The old garden centre sat with its mouth shut, paper scabbed on the windows and an advertisement for compost so faded it looked like a watercolor of rot. Archie reached the door with his competent big-man walk, put his hand to the padlock and found, as Ewan had, that locks are for people who believe every box must have a lid. The chain dropped with a complaining noise. He pushed and the door breathed plastic.\n\nThe rustling rose. It was a choir and a tide and a thousand dresses in a thousand changing rooms deciding whether they fit. The men paused as if the noise were a dog you had to let sniff you before you reached out a hand. Ewan stepped to the side, where the shadow held a bit richer, and put his palm to the cool flake of wall just to tell it he was here and had come to mind the place too. He didn\u2019t love these acts of forgetting\u2014entering and making inventory of another\u2019s life\u2014but sometimes the world\u2019s lungs get clogged and you bring hot water and you do what you do and call it mercy.\n\nInside the light was again that dirt-sieved softness, and the arrangements were as he\u2019d seen them but altered with a care that knew it was being watched. The curtain of carriers hung like a drawn breath you weren\u2019t allowed to let out yet. The chalk circles had been swept once, briskly, so that their edges blurred into the concrete like thought into sleep. On the wall the photographs had multiplied and now there were phrases written around them in a regular hand: COLLECTING IS CARE. TIDY IS LOVE. The statements sat like labels under museum glasswork, inviting your conscience to nod.\n\n\u201cGuid God,\u201d Archie breathed. \u201cHe\u2019s daft.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaft\u2019s a tool,\u201d Mhairi said. \u201cPlenty use it to make a point sharp.\u201d She put the basket down and took out gloves, the pink fairy-liquid sort that looked ridiculous on her and did not make her less dangerous. She passed a pair to Ewan. \u201cOn.\u201d\n\nPC Lyle\u2019s radio muttered and then calmed. She stepped forward until she was the person at the hinge point and spoke into the room as if the room had ears that wanted to be used, which it did. \u201cSir,\u201d she said, voice even, carrying. \u201cBlaise Carrid? Anyone? This is the police. We\u2019re here to discuss reports and to ensure nobody\u2019s hurt. We\u2019d like a chat.\u201d\n\nThe curtain moved. Not like a stage curtain drawn back to reveal, not theatrically; rather like a skin that had changed its mind and decided to be a door. It parted just enough to put a person through and then closed because that was its habit. Blaise came out in his tidy jacket and his tired eyes that, close up, were paler than was good for anyone. He held a jar in one hand with care as if it were a baby\u2019s head. In the other hand his fingers pinched a pair of bag handles as if for reassurance.\n\n\u201cOfficer,\u201d he said, and his voice went to a scraping gentleness. \u201cWelcome. Have you brought your litter picks? I find I never have enough hands.\u201d\n\nArchie made a noise that had a swear in it in all but the letters. PC Lyle shifted her weight in the way of a person prepared to be colossally patient and also to turn into a lighthouse if needed. \u201cWe\u2019ve had complaints,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout obstructions. About traps. About\u2026 installations in public pathways. About harm to wildlife. We need a look round and a discussion of what\u2019s yours and what\u2019s not yours to keep.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is mine that everyone else throws away,\u201d Blaise said. He smiled in a manner that tried for reasonable and landed just past the mark. \u201cI am your bin. I am your conscience made busy. I am what the council would be if the council had a heart. Look how I have made it neat.\u201d He gestured and the bag wall rustled as if applauding.\n\n\u201cYe\u2019re catching birds,\u201d Archie snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s all the neat ye need to ken.\u201d He jerked his chin at the curtain. \u201cWhat\u2019s behind?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy thoughts,\u201d Blaise said, softening his mouth into sympathy for his own joke. He looked at Ewan then, as if they had a private conversation waiting to be resumed. \u201cMr. Calder. I\u2019m glad you came. Librarians are the proper audience for any man\u2019s archive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not an archive,\u201d Ewan said. He didn\u2019t know he was going to say it; the sentence had been sitting in him, a pebble ready for tongue. \u201cYou\u2019re a blockage pretending to be a collection. Archives know the future will need a path through. You\u2019re making a maze because you like watching people try the wrong way first.\u201d\n\nBlaise\u2019s eyes held him for a beat that pinched exactly where embarrassment and satisfaction meet. He lifted the jar a little in a gesture of toast. \u201cA fair speech. Would you like to hear my wind?\u201d He held the jar up for the room like a priest might hold a wafer. The label read in that clean hand: HAAR, BOUGHT AND PAID. He twisted the lid. A smell came out like wet paper and salt, and along with it a sound too small to measure until it passed your ear and suddenly you knew you\u2019d heard it all your life when mornings went white. The edges of the room softened. Concrete went a shade like milk that\u2019s just realized it is no longer in the cow. Archie swore properly this time. The council lads swore too, but quieter, as if sound itself had thickened.\n\nEwan felt the pressure the sound made not on his eardrum so much as on the little hairs of his arms. He watched the jar. He watched Blaise\u2019s hand on the lid and understood he had been honest the last time in one small thing: he did not have patience for smallness. The twist of the lid, the press of the thumb to make the seal break, the care of the tongue of tin as it unrolled\u2014Blaise liked the big act in those tiny acts. He liked a scale model of power.\n\n\u201cStop that,\u201d PC Lyle said, calm as the inside of a teacup. \u201cWe\u2019re here to secure an unsafe site and arrest if necessary. Mr. Carrid, I\u2019m going to ask you to place the container on the table and step back. We can talk about what you think you\u2019re doing with the river, but we\u2019ll do it without tricks.\u201d\n\n\u201cTricks,\u201d Blaise repeated, tasting the word to see if it had any sugar left. \u201cNo. Not tricks. Remedies. Palliatives. You might say a cream on a rash. Your wind complains to me, Officer. It says, \u2018Men have poked holes in me and called it clean living.\u2019 It says, \u2018I carry your bright suffering to the hedgerows and hold it there like I am paid to hold.\u2019 I give wind comfort. I give wind a way to be beautiful again.\u201d\n\nMhairi took a step, which was really three steps and the history of her ankles, and placed herself very gently beside the table with the jars. Her hands went nowhere near them. She looked at Blaise the way a wall looks at ivy. \u201cYe\u2019re hurting things,\u201d she said. There were words that belonged to court and council minutes and she did not bother with them. \u201cYe\u2019re hurting things and that\u2019s not all right. Ye say beautiful as if it were a word that belonged to ye. Beauty does not cover blood.\u201d\n\nBlaise\u2019s face pinched then. For a moment, the neatness went, and what was under it looked raw and underfed. \u201cI\u2019m tidying,\u201d he said. It had the weight of a plea and the edge of threat. \u201cNo one thanks a man for tidying. But afterwards they look around and they think the world is better behaved somehow, and they never think why. I gather. I keep. I make uses. I tell wind where to sleep and water where to lay down its cargo. I make nests for the plastic birds, Miss\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cMhairi Latch,\u201d she said briskly, because withholding a name is sometimes power and sometimes pettiness and she picked generosity as the sharper blade. \u201cAn\u2019 ye dinna get ta call me Miss as if that made me a decoration in your speech.\u201d She looked at the curtain. \u201cWhat ye built is moving wrong. It\u2019s trying to make itself into a sea with a skin. Seas dinna like skins. Do ye ken how many wee lives live in a thread o water at the edge o that car park? Ye\u2019re blocking them with your good intentions.\u201d\n\nA sound came from the far side of the curtain. Not wind. Not bag. Not man. A shuffle and a startle. PC Lyle\u2019s head turned the way a cat\u2019s does when it knows there\u2019s a mouse under the board. \u201cSir,\u201d she called, louder. \u201cIf there\u2019s anyone else in there, come out. Now, please.\u201d\n\nThe curtain shifted in a slow pulse and then parted enough to spit out a boy. He was fourteen by his bones and seventeen by his mouth and six by his eyes, which were very large in a ghastly way. He had the look of someone who has breathed recirculated air too long and now can\u2019t remember if air can be got in other ways. His hoodie bore a school crest in the same way a pond bears summer pollen. He clutched a chain of knotted handles and did not seem to know his hand was doing it. \u201cHe said we were doing good,\u201d he said, politeness still clinging to him like sugar. \u201cHe said it was art. He said it\u2019d stop the birds choakin.\u201d He looked at Mhairi the way boys look at women who have never betrayed them. \u201cWas that wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cNae your wrong,\u201d Mhairi said. She moved like the ground moving under snow. She put her hand on the chain, and her glove creaked. \u201cYe go outside with the officer now and get a drink. Ye say, \u2018I was there, I dinna ken why,\u2019 and ye say your mam\u2019s name three times. That\u2019ll set your heart to its true size again.\u201d\n\nPC Lyle, to her credit, did not snort at the order about names. She stepped to the boy and took him as if he had come to her because he liked her, not because a lot of adults had given him no choice. They went to the door and light lay on them briefly like a blessing.\n\nArchie rubbed his neck. \u201cChrist alive. He\u2019s got bairns in here, Calder. I thought this was just one of those loners who mutter in the post office queue.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never been alone a day in his life,\u201d Ewan said. The words surprised him with their authority. He had been alone the particular way that means you can hear certain voices. Blaise\u2019s voice snagged him because it was pitched to end up inside men like him.\n\nBlaise smiled at him again because he could not let anything be said without wanting to own it. \u201cChildren are better at civic spirit than you think,\u201d he said. \u201cThey believe in rules, if you tell them rules are a kind of kindness. They believe in gleaning. They like to be on a team that is praised by the sky. They have not yet been told that cleaning is women\u2019s work and unbeautiful, and so they bring me the bits you leave in your hedges and I make their efforts matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make yourself matter to yourself,\u201d Ewan said. He wanted not to be roused to point-scoring, but here they were, two men, and logic never saved men from themselves. \u201cThe rest is arras.\u201d\n\n\u201cArras,\u201d Blaise said, pleased with the medievalism and the way it made his mouth feel. \u201cYes. Curtains. Hides and reveals. We do love a reveal. For example.\u201d He put his hand in the bulge of his jacket and brought out a small device, one of those cheap plastic boxes you buy to make a noise on a farm gate when foxes come. He pressed it and the box crowed.\n\nIt was a poor crow. It was tinny, a parody, more door than bird. It was also enough. Ewan had time to think, It\u2019s not the sound, it\u2019s what I think it means, and then the hinge opened in him and all his careful ties loosened. The jars on the table hummed. The curtain made an encouraging sound as if for a child taking its first step. Bags along the wall lifted their handles as if they had been given rehearsal instructions.\n\nHe put his hand out blindly and found, absurdly, the old retail clock. The second hand ticked. He held it with his palm and felt the rude time of shops\u2014a fast, restful measure\u2014run into his skin. He took a breath. He made himself shape it into a softer thing than panic. He heard his grandmother say, You can\u2019t stop the rooster saying his say, you can only make promises about what you\u2019ll do when he\u2019s done. He made himself remember the bowl. He made himself remember three seconds.\n\nHe had no bowl, which was maybe a mercy because bowls had failed him. He had his mouth. He breathed out, a tiny steadying stream, and on that breath he laid his spell like dust on a mantel. It was not a hex or a ban. It was a promise. He said, just under hearing and not at all under hope, \u201cI will see what I need to see and stop. And then start. And then stop. And start again.\u201d\n\nIn that sliver of calm the crowing was ridiculous rather than monumental, and the room knew the difference. The jars dimmed a fraction. The curtain faltered. Blaise\u2019s finger on the button pressed harder as if pressing harder had ever taught a machine more meaning.\n\nArchie, who started life as a boy who hit things until they broke and had become a man who now knew how not to, raised his hand in the way he did when stopping traffic and said to his crew, \u201cCut the strings.\u201d He wasn\u2019t looking at the bag handles. He was looking at the lines where Blaise\u2019s installations met the anchor points\u2014the bits tied to the metal shelf uprights, to the window struts, to the nailed-down tables. He\u2019d done enough festivals and fair days to know that if you unhook the points, the bunting falls without fuss.\n\nThe lads waded toward the curtain in their gloves, and the curtain, affronted, tried to be clever. It flexed and made a pouch and tried to cup a man. It went rigid and tried to become a wall. It failed at being anything but itself, which was embarrassing to watch. Mhairi put the flat of her hand under the nearest fluorescent tube and its squeal, which had been rising in the noise like a violin in a nervous orchestra, flattened obediently. \u201cWe\u2019re not at your concert, son,\u201d she told the light. \u201cYe\u2019ve had your turn.\u201d\n\nBlaise moved then, quick, the way men do when a plan has gone from being a beautiful concept to being a thing that has to dodge boots. He snapped another jar\u2019s lid\u2014the label said PARKING LOT CRY\u2014and for an instant everyone smelled petrol and lonely. Outside, a gull shouted the sort of laugh that makes you doubt your pride. He lifted his bag-handles rope like a whip and swung it. The rope hit Archie\u2019s arm, and for a second it stuck, not glue, not magic like the stories tell; static, the sort that raises your hair and makes your teeth remember tin foil. Archie swore and shook his arm and the stuckness went and left a memory.\n\n\u201cAll right, Mr. Carrid,\u201d PC Lyle said, and the tea-cup calm turned to ceramic you could break a head with. She put her hand to her belt and pulled from it not a truncheon, not a gun, just a pair of scissors, the sort you use for casualty tape. She held them up so he could see. \u201cWe will be cutting your ties,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will be cutting your access. We will be cutting off your\u2026 air.\u201d She didn\u2019t look at Ewan, but he felt as if she had set him an exercise in the proper use of the word hinge.\n\nEwan moved along the wall towards the photographs because the photographs were the place where Blaise\u2019s wanting had to make marks you could read. Among the river circles and trolley lines, one image had been added. It was Bennachie, drawn badly with felt-tip, a child\u2019s profile of a hill with ears. Across the summit someone had written: COCKPIT. He made a noise of his own, the kind you make when someone has put a grubby thumb on your best plate.\n\nHe reached under the table for the charm he\u2019d felt the last time and found not his own card under cardboard, but something Blaise had fixed there: a twist of grey plastic like a nest with a pebble in it. He held it. It thrummed. He thought, He\u2019s made himself a cockerel. He\u2019s made himself a morning he controls. He felt anger in him rise the way bread rises, swelling and fragrant and not helpful if not punched down. He remembered the co-op sign: please re-use your carrier bags. The second please like a prayer. He looked at the pebble. He breathed on it. He said, simple as the label on the jar and truer, \u201cPlease stop.\u201d\n\nSometimes that is the whole spell. Not often, because the world is large and polite does not always move it. But if you say Please to a thing that has been used for too many not-pleases, sometimes the thing sighs. The thrumming eased. He put the cheap nest back under the cardboard where it would have to content itself with wincing at feet above. He stood again and saw that Blaise\u2019s hand had shifted towards the door as if to find a path. He said, because men who make mazes often forget that other men see them too, \u201cDon\u2019t run. You\u2019ll make it worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWorse for whom?\u201d Blaise snapped. He seemed thinner in the light. The jars on the table sat sullenly. The curtain had lost any pretense to being a wall and slumped, half-fallen, two council lads picking it apart like a knitting disaster. He gripped his sound box. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand morning, Mr. Calder. You never did. You think it\u2019s a thing that happens to you. It\u2019s a structure. It\u2019s a song you can teach. I have made a morning that doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d He lifted the little crow machine and pressed it until it buzzed. It made, this time, a sound so sad and so cheap that even his own installation went embarrassed and refused to answer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made a morning that won\u2019t tell the truth,\u201d Ewan said. He felt the hinge in him and did not flinch this once. \u201cI need the hurt to know where I am. You need it too, or you wouldn\u2019t be fighting it so hard.\u201d He stepped toward him. He did not raise his hand because men who raise hands in rooms like this knock things that shouldn\u2019t be knocked. He said, in the voice he used to quiet lights and Bollinger swans in the park and laddies with triangles, \u201cEnough.\u201d\n\nIt was not magic any more than saying a name well is magic. It was deciding that a certain run of the world stops at your tongue. It can be the height of arrogance. It can also be a duty like tightening a jar for someone whose fingers are swollen. Blaise flinched. PC Lyle\u2019s patience had done the necessary creeping and turned in its neat shoes into action. She moved and laid a hand on his wrist and the bag-rope fell to the floor like a pet that has given up on being taken seriously. Archie stepped in with the other hand, and between them Blaise stood very still, as if he had come to the edge of a pond and suddenly seen his face in it and not liked, unexpectedly, how tired he looked.\n\nThey cuffed him, in the soft way for men not drunk and not swinging. He watched Ewan the whole time as if wanting to believe he had been misunderstood. \u201cIt\u2019s not crime,\u201d he said, not to the officer or the orange jacket. \u201cIt\u2019s care. I have been so careful.\u201d\n\nEwan wanted very much to say, I know. He did not say it because there are kindnesses that tie the wrong knots. He bent instead and put his palms to his knees and looked at the floor until the tremor that had danced in his fingers took itself elsewhere.\n\nOutside, the wind had its own ideas and was making them known around the lip of the unit roofs. Bags in the hedges lifted their handles, hopeful, and then went down again because hope is tiring. PC Lyle led Blaise out with a light hand. The boy was on the kerb with a carton of juice a council lad had found in a box\u2014the box said MILK on the side as if anything in this world stayed what you named it. He looked at Blaise with a betrayal that wasn\u2019t his own, and then at Ewan, and then at nothing, which was sometimes the kindest place to look.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Archie said, brisk, as if time had tugged his sleeve and reminded him it had other children to attend to. \u201cWe\u2019ll tape up, we\u2019ll get a proper team for the inventory. Lads, leave the jars. If anyone\u2019s daft enough to open one, I want it ta be at the station where we can blame the chief.\u201d He clapped Ewan on the shoulder in a way that acknowledged there was a shoulder there that had done something and that he had noticed. \u201cYe did fine,\u201d he said, and then, because compliments make his mouth itch, \u201cYe looked sick as a dug for a minute.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was,\u201d Ewan said. He straightened. The light outside had gone the colour of thin tea. Bennachie lay behind the retail units as solid as irony. The harebelles in a crack by the loading bay nodded as if they agreed with him. \u201cIt\u2019ll be worse later,\u201d he added, and wasn\u2019t sure if he meant for Blaise or himself or the bags that now had no conductor. He touched his own coat pockets and found, as he always did, nothing in there that would pass for courage if measured by others, only the tatters of what kept his hands from loving too much the idea of closing.\n\nMhairi had been going around in the background like a quiet parent, undoing small knots and making small notes. She came to him when the vans had shut their doors and the police car had closed the bag of its man and was sitting with its engine purring indecisively. \u201cIt\u2019s not done,\u201d she said, because her gift had always been not letting anyone think the third act had lasted more than ten lines. \u201cHe\u2019ll have other corners. Magic loves corners. He\u2019ll have made friends with wind that canna be unfriended with paperwork. Ye\u2019ll be needed to walk around this town and tell it itself again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d he said, knowing it would not really be a thing he did but a thing he joined in with all the other old women and lads and stony hills and Handel-singing daft roosters and light bulbs and rivers. He rubbed his fingers as if washing them without water. \u201cThe rooster,\u201d he said then, helplessly. \u201cHe pressed a box and it\u2014 It shouldn\u2019t\u2014 It\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all just a shape. Ye made another shape. Ye\u2019ll do it again. Ye dinna get rid of what frightens ye by throwing it away. Ye turn it ta a shelf in your kitchen where it bides and holds tea towels.\u201d She looked at the sky and made a noise that might once have been a laugh. \u201cAn\u2019 then, when ye\u2019re feeling very clever, it\u2019ll jump down and crow in your cupboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cComforting,\u201d he said, and she grinned at him with her ruined teeth and made him feel the right kind of small.\n\nThey walked away from the building. The wind came busy around the corners and discovered there was less to knock now. It tried to lift a chain of bags that had fallen by the door and failed. Across the road a woman coming out of the co-op carried a bought bag, the sturdy kind you pay a pound for and feel virtuous about. She had oranges in it. The bag sat well on her hip like a child. You could see the uses. You could see the lie sitting next to the use and choosing not to speak.\n\nBy the allotments, Moira was at her plot putting in a row of something not yet herself. She looked up when they passed and lifted a muddy glove. \u201cDid ye?\u201d she asked, and Ewan, who had never felt that good at plain answers, gave her one.\n\n\u201cWe did,\u201d he said. \u201cFor now.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now\u2019s a feast,\u201d she said, approving. \u201cYe\u2019ll be back at t\u2019library later? There\u2019s a lad will want that birth notice ye found.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put it aside.\u201d He started to turn and then paused. He took two steps back. \u201cDid you ever see a cockerel with a plastic tag on its foot?\u201d he asked, a question that had percolated up from some sunk corner of him.\n\nMoira squinted. \u201cOn wee bits farms, aye, they tie foolish things to birds. Ye\u2019re no meaning one o yon numbers for fancy breedin? My uncle glued a wee sat-nav to a pigeon once; it went to Forres and stayed. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo reason,\u201d he said, and meant the opposite, but there was a limit to how many reasons a morning would hold without splitting.\n\nHe made his way home by the path that skirted the river and gave the water its say. It spoke in the old dirty manners of rivers, dragging itself over stones and pretending it had never been in a jar. On the bank a bag was snagged that had printed on it a drawing of a tree and a promise of carbon offsets, vaguely religious. He stooped. He shook his hand once, sharply, the way his grandmother had taught, and the bag went to sugar and fell like blessing or ash.\n\nIn his kitchen he put the kettle on because you could always do that. He took the pieces he had cut the night before from under the legs of table and chair and window and door, because they had served, and he burned them and said nothing over them. The smoke the plastic did not make was the kind of miracle no one writes down.\n\nAt the library, the third light flickered as he came in and steadied as if it had heard news. The old woman with hands like paper sat by the window, not reading. He went to her and said, because courtesy is a charm, \u201cGood afternoon, Mrs. Bruce. Will the light do for ye?\u201d and she said, \u201cIt will if it\u2019s told to,\u201d and he put his palm under it as you do under the chin of a small dog.\n\nThe schoolboys came at four and swore at triangles with zest. He told them triangles were older and more patient than any of them, and they agreed to disagree with handsome sinners\u2019 smiles. The births column gave up a tiny name under G, and Ewan put the note in an envelope and wrote on the front, for Moira\u2019s Hatton lad with cold hands and a granny who worries. He went to the back door at closing and stood in the alley, listening for bags, and heard only the ordinary rustle of the day putting itself back into drawers.\n\nAt dusk he took the long way home by the sign where the scarf hung and looked at Bennachie. The hill was unbothered. It doesn\u2019t get paid to be bothered. It held the sky up at the place where sky would have sagged if left to itself, and it did not notice the compliment; that\u2019s the way with hills. He breathed. The air tasted of damp cardboard and a little garden smoke and the metal of the bypass. Somewhere a bird made the small contented noise birds make when they\u2019ve found the exact twig that suits the evening they\u2019re having. He stood as still as a door that knows it is sometimes a window, and for the whole length of three long breaths he did not imagine a crow. Then he went in and shut the normal door that was a door and put his palm to it once, just once, as if doors needed to be told they were doing very well.\n\nWhen he woke at three, which he always did, the night lay on him like a coat that fit, and he listened to the wind test the corners of the cottage and found it did not say bag bag bag. It said, in the old way, I was here before you and I will be after, and you can borrow me for your walking. He whispered three names and the folded line of the Don\u2019s course, out of habit and out of love. He closed his eyes and did not see a bowl and did not see a cockerel and did not tumble infinite. He slept again like a man who had been to a meeting and come away with less plastic in his lungs.\n\nIn the morning there was a letter through his door without a stamp, very tidy, black ink, straight lines. He made tea and opened it and read, Ewan Calder\u2014since names are bridges\u2014thank you for your visit. They say I am Blaise. I will be called other things now. You may rest easy; I have no desire to crow. But we are not finished, because wind, as you know, makes a habit of the gaps under doors. I left, in goodwill and as proof of courtesy, a jar for you. It is outside in the hedge to the left if you stand facing Bennachie. It is labeled, as true things are. You will have to decide whether to open it. If you do, you will hear something you have mistaken all your life for cruelty. If you do not, you will live and die in sound\u2019s shadow. Consider this my apology and my boast both. Kindly, B.\n\nHe set the letter down. He did not move for a while because standing very still is also a movement. Then he went out and to the left and looked at the hedge. The jar sat in the branches like a huge cold berry. The label was neat and he hated it. He took it in his hand. It was heavier than it should be. On it, in Blaise\u2019s tidy letters, was written: COCKSPUR.\n\nHe held it. He did not open it. He stood in his small lane where the morning was becoming the day and the day would do its shopping and the wind would go to the co-op and buy a little rustle and put it in its pocket. He held Blaise\u2019s jar and he held himself, and he did not hurry because you should not hurry a hinge. He went back inside and put the jar on the table, and for once he did not speak to the cottage because there are times you keep your counsel even with the things you love. He made tea. He stood in front of the Jar as if in front of a man and said, \u201cPlease,\u201d once. He did not know to whom the please belonged, and that seemed only fair.",

The label peered up at him with a small arrogance because tidy handwriting often does, and the word sat there like a thorn the paper had grown: COCKSPUR. He could have opened it there on the table as if he were a man making jam social. He could have heated a knife and slipped it under the lid to startle the seal without the little shriek lids made. He could have put it in the bin, the plain coward\u2019s sacrament, and then all day listened to the phantom of it tell him what it had been. He did none of those. He made his tea and drank half standing, which he never did, then put the jar in his coat, not inside to his heart where it might talk to bones, but in the outside pocket where a nail had once worn a worry and he had mended it with invisible thread. It sat there and made no sound because jars are not obliged to warn you what they are holding.\n\nHe took the long way to the allotments. The light came across the roofs with the kind of reluctant kindness the north does so well. The lanes had been beaten tidy by cars, and at their edges the dandelions were doing sums with themselves and finding that one head becomes a hundred without asking permission. At the first corner a handful of bags had collected like pensioners, set their backs to the hedge and talked quietly of wind in the tone of those who intend to outlive it. He shook his fingers at them by habit and they did their old-sugar trick, a snowfall of brittle that is not winter. A man pushing a buggy looked at him as if to put him in a box that read odd, and he let himself go in that box because it had more air than the one that read mad.\n\nMhairi had a saucepan on at the allotment gate, not for food, but for the comfort of something boiling where you could see it. The smell was not soup. It was rowan and vinegar and a little iron. She had a stick bound with red thread, and her scarf today had cherries on it as if to taunt any gods within reach with the thought of summer.\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d she said, taking him in like weather. \u201cDid ye sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jar came with a letter. He thanks me. He boasts. He does both like a man thinking himself born for a dais.\u201d He pulled the jar from his pocket and put it on her paling table as if setting a baby down where all hands could see it.\n\nShe looked and made a small unhappy mouth. \u201cHe\u2019s tidy,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s folk who clean to make space. An\u2019 there\u2019s folk who clean so their head can sit without making mess. Ye can tell which by their labels.\u201d She tapped the word with a knuckle. \u201cCockspur. He\u2019s a one for word games. He kens that the hawthorn that catches your coat is called that. He kens that cocks have spurs that draw blood and make men applaud in places I dinna go. He kens three meanings and hopes ye\u2019ll do his fourth for him: he hopes ye\u2019ll think fate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think invitation,\u201d Ewan said. He didn\u2019t know until he said it that this had been the word he\u2019d been holding under his tongue, making it soft.\n\n\u201cThat too.\u201d She took the stick and touched the red twine. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it by the water. Ye dinna open jars of a man\u2019s temper under cabbages. They\u2019ve their own moods without ye adding.\u201d\n\nThey walked down past the bean poles and the beds where lettuces lay like little green hearts. At the corner the hawthorn\u2014cockspur, the old women called it when it snagged your stockings\u2014had gone sugary with blossom and now was going brown at the edges in a way that was both defeat and promise. Mhairi pinched a thorn and tugged. It let go because it knew her. She wound the thorn into the red on the stick until the thread and spike made a thought together. \u201cRight,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the bend.\u201d\n\nAt the Bass the Don behaved well for once; it moved as if it had somewhere useful to be and lacked the energy to preen. The willow dripped the way old willows do when they\u2019ve given up on the idea of being anything other than explanation. Underneath, on the little bit of half-mud half-sand, a child\u2019s spade lay buried up to its throat. The river had been playing at graveyard.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do it at tide of people,\u201d Mhairi said, which was her way of saying not at dawn\u2014his bad hour\u2014and not at noon when everything\u2019s loud. The traffic had not started properly yet. The dog-walkers were about, and their companions went stiff-leggedly through life as if braced for a joke. Across on the Ury a heron took itself like a thought into the air and stood there because it had been doing it longer than he had been breathing.\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d Ewan asked, hating the plea shape in his mouth and being grateful for it at the same time.\n\n\u201cYe ken how,\u201d she said. \u201cYe just dinna prefer it. Ye ask. Ye promise. Ye decide. Ye dinna wait for the world to tell ye what ye are. Ye\u2019ve three breaths. If ye use more, the world tells ye its version. If ye use less, ye tell the world what it wants and not what it needs. I\u2019ll keep count. I\u2019ll keep ye in the river\u2019s manners. The thorn is for pricking pride. The red is for remembering blood that\u2019s not yours to spill. Ye\u2019ll open and close. We\u2019ll throw nothing in. We\u2019ll leave nowt but air behind.\u201d\n\nHe took the jar. It was heavier here, or his arm was weaker; you can never tell and it doesn\u2019t matter. The lid under his fingers had the memory of a machine. He thought of Blaise\u2019s careful twist, the love he had for lids giving up, and he refused to be gentle in that way. He put the thorn to the lid\u2019s lip and breathed out on it as on a spoon to cool porridge. He said, because it had worked once and because if a word has worked once you owe it that you try it again, \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nThe lid did its small ring and release. At the same instant Mhairi\u2019s hand came down on his wrist not to stop him but to tell him he was not alone. \u201cOne,\u201d she said, voice as calm as a religious potato. \u201cTwo. Three.\u201d\n\nThe sound came out like a hand out of a stack of hay. It had bits of straw in it. It had the bulk weight of something you expect to be thin and find is not. It was a rooster, yes, the old shape of morning, the edge of a knife tied in a knot and set on a barrel. But in it, braided in the crow without mercy, were things he had never allowed himself to notice: the small before-sound of the throat, the spring in the chest, the ridiculousness. It was a boy pretending to be a king and knowing his friends were trying not to laugh; it was a door hinge doing its work bravely in a damp shed; it was the sound of a neighbour\u2019s alarm clock through a wall who every morning at six-something cursed but got up anyway to go lay stones or take blood or draw lines straight as a creed. It was ugly and it was wonderful and it did not ask his permission to be both. It went through him and the hinge in him opened and a cool wind came and went and did not do any harm. He had time to think, This is almost holy in its refusal to be what I require, and then he shut the lid not in panic but in obedience to the rule he had agreed in his bones before he came down here.\n\nHe stood with the jar in his hands and Mhairi with her hand on his arm, and he was shaking the way you shake when you have been standing too long and your blood remembers to move. He waited for the thinness afterwards and the horrid return of the bowl\u2014the plummet, the falling. It did not come. It stood back from him like a dog told to go to its bed. He opened his mouth and discovered he could breathe without climbing over anything. He made a sound that might have been a laugh and might have been an old cough leaving.\n\n\u201cAgain?\u201d Mhairi asked after a while, so very kind that he nearly told her he loved her. She pinched his forearm. \u201cNay yet, laddie. Ye dinna bring an ocean into a tea cup twice in one morning. We\u2019ll set it away.\u201d She took the red off the thorn and put the thorn back into the hawthorn as if you could return its memory to it. \u201cThat\u2019s its work. Ye\u2019ve yours.\u201d\n\nHe put the jar in his coat again. It felt less like a threat now and more like a spool of thin wire, dangerous if silly, useful if you knew where your fingers were. They stood a while and watched the water practice being itself. A man came down with a spaniel who regarded them as if they were horticulturalists interfering with the dog\u2019s rights. The man nodded in that north way that doesn\u2019t demand fairness or answer. Across the whisper of the willow leaves he could hear, faint, boys at the skate park practicing falling without breaking when they could help it.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll tell Archie ye\u2019ve it,\u201d Mhairi said, practical sliding back into her like a drawer. \u201cHe\u2019ll scold. He\u2019ll say words that sound like forms. There\u2019ll be a word like evidence in there, and he is not wrong. Ye\u2019ll say ye had ta make it safe, ye have not yet thrown it in the river like a numpty, ye\u2019ll bring it to Lyle in a bag that does not have any devils in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell him,\u201d Ewan said, and lifted his face to the line of the hill. Bennachie had put a shoulder out of the cloud and was showing off its good bone. \u201cIt was\u2026 not as I thought.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never is,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the sorrow and the saving both.\u201d\n\nNews travels in this town like water finds the low places\u2014by inevitability and by teasing. By midday three separate people had come into the library with borrowed forms of the same story. In one, the bagman had died in a fight and risen from it like a zombie wearing a co-op uniform. In another, the police had discovered that he was a genius and given him a job at the recycling centre and a badge you could respect from a distance. Mr. Graham confided behind a large volume of forestry statistics that the lad taken out had been his own grandson, which was demonstrably false as Mr. Graham did not have children and also the boy in question had hair. The old woman by the window did not speak at all, which meant she knew exactly what had happened and had decided the town would choke on its own talk and then feel better.\n\nArchie called at three with a voice that had been practising patience and now could nearly wear it. \u201cWhere are ye?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the stacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome out of the stacks and into the car park. I\u2019m outside. Your face in my window in three minutes, Calder.\u201d\n\nHe went. Archie sat with his arm out the van window as if it were July, which it was not, and wore his hi-vis with the look of a man who would have preferred armour if funding had allowed. PC Lyle was in the passenger seat with a file the thickness of a cheap jumper and the expression of a woman who has had to note down more adjectives than a person should. There was a smell of crisps because authority likes salt.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Archie said when Ewan stood at his window. \u201cDo ye have anything that belongs to the investigation and does not belong on your kitchen table?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ewan said because there was no point climbing into a lie that would only gouge him. \u201cHe left me a jar. I opened it. Controlled circumstances. Not at dawn.\u201d\n\nArchie closed his eyes briefly as if he had been a teacher too long and a child had told him they had done an experiment with the bunsen turned to Satan. PC Lyle turned a page and did not smirk, which counted as a compliment from the law. \u201cWhat label,\u201d she asked, pen ready.\n\n\u201cCockspur,\u201d he said, and had the odd sensation of giving away a truth that was not his and not the jar\u2019s, but the town\u2019s. \u201cIt holds\u2026 what it says. I opened it three seconds. With witness. It did no harm. It will do harm if kept badly. I was keeping it well.\u201d He didn\u2019t know why he needed to say the last, but his grandmother had always insisted that promises you make to yourself need to be aired where other ears can pin them to you later.\n\n\u201cHow did it come to be on your premises?\u201d Lyle asked, steady, a person who had never been to his kitchen but understood kitchens in general, which was nearly as good.\n\n\u201cHe put it in my hedge.\u201d He described the letter without saying what it had done to his hand to see Kindly, B. in that tidy ink. \u201cI have it. I can bring it to you at the station at six. It will be sealed. It is a hazard if used as a weapon. It is less a hazard if you treat it as\u2026 as a live wire.\u201d\n\nArchie grunted. His eyes had the tired you get from taking in too much civic indignation at once. \u201cJesus wept at the paperwork,\u201d he said, which was not his usual religious way. \u201cFine. Six. Don\u2019t put it anywhere warm. Don\u2019t put it anywhere very cold. Don\u2019t put it in a bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Ewan said, and they looked at each other and had the experience of two men of different worlds finding themselves for a second in a plague year on the same bench. Archie nodded. \u201cYe did good,\u201d he said, and then, as always, \u201cOnce.\u201d He drove off with Lyle making notes at his left, and the van\u2019s brake light blinked in the way of someone closing a parenthesis.\n\nAt four the schoolboys came and swore at triangles with a restored verve. They had heard, of course. Their hearing had improved miraculously in one day. \u201cMist\u2019r Calder,\u201d one said, the one with the soft half-moustache that looked as if it had been spilled by a careless god. \u201cIs it true the bagman had birds that he\u2019d trained to steal chips off folk for him?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he had hopes,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cBirds have their own opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye,\u201d the boy said, with all a teenager\u2019s contempt for any citizen not himself, \u201cbirds are away with it. I seen a gull swallow a bairn\u2019s hat. Like. Whole. My maw says we should just poison them. I say that\u2019s murder. But funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour maw is wrong on method and you are wrong on texture,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cGulls deserve respect for their honesty. They will steal off you to your face. Some folk make that into a career.\u201d He looked at them properly. \u201cWere ye at the garden centre?\u201d\n\nThey did their teenage mouth shapes that are not speaking and not keeping silence. One shook his head with a seriousness that touched him. \u201cNaw,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Jay was. He said the man said if they tied stuff right they\u2019d save wee birds. I dinna think he\u2019s slept since last week. He smells like the swimming pool. He said he could hear the wind talk in the bags. That\u2019s messed up, aye?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cDrink water instead of hearing wind if you have the choice. If Jay comes in, send him to Mrs. Latch at the allotments. She\u2019ll tell him a story that doesn\u2019t hurt afterwards.\u201d\n\nThe boy\u2019s face lit into mischief at the idea of sex in a shed because they are twelve even when they are seventeen, and then smoothed again as he saw that Ewan meant exactly what he said and not the joke the boy had thought would save them both from feeling anything. \u201cAye,\u201d he said, and bent his head to the triangle that was older than him and his father and the arguments in their house.\n\nAt ten to six he signed out and put the CLOSED sign up and made sure the third light would not sulk, and then he took the jar back out of his pocket. He wrapped it in a tea towel that had a strawberry on one corner and a burn he did not admit to having made, and he put it in the old canvas bag from a book fair that had a print of a whale on it. He did not put that bag inside another bag. He walked to the police station by the path that passes the sly shop that sells things you didn\u2019t know you needed tucked between the shoe repair and the accountants. Outside the station a hanging basket of petunias had refused to be cowed by the rest of the day and was being obscene in colour in the best way.\n\nPC Lyle met him at the door and took him into a room that smelt like linoleum and anger soaked up. She took the jar with both hands and set it on a tray as if it were a cake a child had made and you could not risk letting pride vanish if the cake fell. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said, rogue sincere in her face. \u201cWe don\u2019t get this kind of assistance often.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s self-interest,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that sound gets loose in the wrong place at the wrong time, someone with my shape of magic will go bottom-up. We are not thick on the ground, but we exist, and you\u2019ll have paperwork you don\u2019t have a template for.\u201d\n\nShe met that with a look that said both, I have a template for most things and also I do not mind drawing a new one if it keeps the town from accusing me of being lax. \u201cI\u2019ll store it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll write in my file that it came to you and you secured it in company. That we did not lose anyone to stupidity this week. Archie will put his name under it because he loves forms the way other men love baths, for how they leave you clean.\u201d She hesitated and then added, with the dryness of a person who does not like to learn but likes to have learned, \u201cIs there anything else of his out there? Anything we should not put our hands in?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and thought of chalk and jars and the little nest of plastic under the table that had quieted at a please. \u201cCorners. He liked corners. He liked the wind in a bottle and never asked it if it wanted to live there. Ask the boys. They\u2019ll have the map whether he put it in their hands or in their feet. And there\u2019s a rooster in town with a plastic tag on its leg. If you can track that, I\u2019d be surprised. But men who like control like tags.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him with the new penny eyes in which respect was a minting, not a gift. \u201cI\u2019ll put it in,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if the chief laughs. He owns chickens. He thinks that qualifies him for all knowledge.\u201d She smiled then, a tiny thing that left the whole of her face unsullied. \u201cYou look better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard one,\u201d he said before he could choose not to. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a war this time.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a clock. We need them. Though I prefer a wristwatch.\u201d\n\nHe went out into evening that was only pretending to be evening because summertime does that, shows you the day\u2019s skull with skin still on. The wind had got bored of its new toy and gone somewhere else to find a crisp packet to flirt with. He walked past the co-op and the woman with the oranges waved her pound-bag at him as if she had read his earlier thoughts and wanted to show him how not to become a problem. Outside Moira\u2019s bakery the crumb-streaked glass had been cleaned and the sign chalked: rowies two for wan today, because language refuses to behave for chalk too.\n\n\u201cYe gave it up?\u201d Moira called through the door as she was sweeping. \u201cThe Jar? Arch says we\u2019re tae make sure folk are scared of jars for a week, which isna practical, but it\u2019s him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI gave it up to people who like lists,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s as practical as we\u2019re going to get.\u201d\n\nShe made her small wasp-frown. \u201cAye well. There\u2019s a cockerel been seeing its-self in my window. My Morven\u2019s away with it, barkin at her own reflection. If this is your doing, I\u2019ll have ye bake on a Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it starts writing me letters I\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d he said, and she laughed without meaning to, and it was a better charm than any he knew.\n\nAt home the cottage did that thing he had asked it to learn\u2014met him at the door like a dog who has agreed to pretend it wasn\u2019t anxiously waiting for your step. He put his palm flat to the wood and said nothing, and the door was good enough to accept that as language. He put the tea towel back on its hook. He put the whale bag away. He stood in the kitchen for a minute and heard, for the first time in a long time, only the house, only the settling. He went to the sink and put both hands under the cold again because he liked the way the pain told him his skin had borders. He took his hands out, shook them, and they were his.\n\nPast midnight he went to the window and let the dark put its jaw on his shoulder. The lane was a strip of small agreements: do not slam doors, do not run cars, do not sing unless you have to. Somewhere a night train shouldered its way under the town like a memory of going elsewhere. He leaned his forehead against the glass that had seen war and ration and disco and men kissing women in corners their mothers would disapprove and men kissing the dark because the dark said nothing at all. He was glad in his quiet, which he had rarely allowed himself to be in case somebody accused him of not trying.\n\nHe woke with the light that comes too early to be polite and lay counting, as he did, the work in his chest. Three heartbeats. Five. A tenth of a river\u2019s travel from one stone to the next. When the town\u2019s rooster, not close, not his, did what roosters have always done in all the towns and pre-towns since chickens were dinosaurs and saw morning with their whole ridiculous faces, he lay and he did not turn into glass. He felt the hinge and allowed it and it did not turn him; he just opened and closed and opened again like he had promised himself he would do at the river. He lay and smiled once into the dark, a brief thing, and it didn\u2019t crack.\n\nThere were new things to do. Archie sent a man round with a list like a scavenger hunt: small plastic constructions found in hedges by Danestone, a wreath of handles wrapped around the foot of the statue in the square, a child brought in a chain of bread bags like a rosary and said he had been told to carry it for luck. PC Lyle asked if he would come to a school assembly and say in that voice he had that turned tin into rope that it was fine to pick up litter but not to make art with it and certainly not to carry handles wrapped around your wrist because your blood is yours to keep. He said he would, and then looked at the calendar and remembered he had, in fact, two days a week a job that paid and included the care of the third light and a woman who needed not-reading by a window. He went to the headmistress and arranged that this was all the town\u2019s work and he could be borrowed and returned like a careful book.\n\nJay came in to the library two days after the jar and sat himself in a corner and did not speak, and Ewan fetched him a glass of water without saying that water is not a magic but behaves like one when you have given your body over to the idea that you can hear plastics whisper. The boy drank. He put the glass on the table like he didn\u2019t trust tables. He said, miserable and polite and still full of hope because fourteen is impossible, \u201cHe said we were menders.\u201d He looked at his own hands as if they were stitched on and might pop. \u201cI liked that. We were a team. Folk said we were daft. That was good. I liked being daft in a good way, if ye ken me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI ken ye,\u201d Ewan said. He sat and made sure his chair was set at a notation that meant, I can get up if you need me to and I can stay if you need me to. \u201cThere are mends that tie a thing back to itself and mends that tie it to the wrong house. Ye can always tell by whether something that lived can move after. If it cannae, you\u2019ve made a cage and called it a fix.\u201d\n\nThe boy stared at him with a hunger that made him so dear that Ewan nearly swore. \u201cI keened the wind,\u201d Jay whispered. \u201cI heard it in the plastic. It liked it. It said it liked the new noise it made. That\u2019s\u2026 bad, aye?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s new,\u201d Ewan said. He thought of the jar and the silly glory of the crow and how it had refused to turn itself into a spear. \u201cNew things call themselves good to get invited in. Some are. Some are like a neighbour who borrows salt and then your car. Ye dinna need that neighbour in your kitchen. Ye can still nod to him in the street. The wind will manage. It does not need you to make it a song it did not ask for. It will be your friend if you do not talk too much.\u201d\n\nJay nodded hard enough to wobble his hair. He was, just then, terribly pure. It made Ewan want to take a knife to the world for him and cut it into pieces that would not cut back. He said instead, because the old women had always told him that a boy learns truth better if it comes in a line he can walk, \u201cYe\u2019ll paint the park fence with Archie on Saturday. In your old coat. Ye\u2019ll swear at your mates for not holding the tin right. Ye\u2019ll go home and eat bread with jam and you\u2019ll think you have saved nothing at all. That will be the most mending done in this town that day, and the wind will gossip about ye to the trees and they\u2019ll clap in their slow way.\u201d\n\nJay grinned, at last. \u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cI can do that. I can swear. I\u2019m good at swearing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am aware,\u201d Ewan said modestly, and the boy\u2019s laugh went under the desk where laughter keeps its spare skins.\n\nThere were cockerels now and then. Not many; not the plague his bones had told him to fear. He saw one at the lane again, not the same bird and yet all birds contain one another. This one had duller colours and a smarter eye. It stood on the gatepost as if the post were a pulpit, and when it crowed he stood and let it pass. It did not undo him. It simply told the day what time it was, and the day nodded because the day is polite.\n\nHe went up Bennachie on a Sunday because he always said he would and often did not, and he stood at the top with the not-many other people and looked out at the way the town petri-dished itself. He thought of the felt-tip drawing with COCKPIT written wrong-headed on it and wanted to take a very schoolroom eraser to the whole idea. There up in the wind, which had a true grin in it, he took the jar from his pocket and turned it in his hands. He did not open it. He did not need to. He let the wind read the label and have its say, which it did, blowing through his coat and catching at his hair as if he were a cousin.\n\nOn the way down he met PC Lyle with her ponytail fathered by economy and a small boy on a lead of twine\u2014a relation, by the careful pride. She raised a hand in the way of professionals off duty agreeing they are still made of the same atoms when not paid to be. \u201cHow\u2019s your jar?\u201d she asked because she was the sort to make any subject comfortable.\n\n\u201cIn custody,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve one for you.\u201d She handed him a photograph, a printout off a printer that had been trying to die since 2009 but refused because there were agendas to be printed. The picture showed a rooster near a skip, its foot held up as if wincing. Around the raised leg was something like a ring. \u201cTag,\u201d she said. \u201cWe can\u2019t get close. Archie says it\u2019ll dine on our fingers. You\u2019ll tell me if you see it. There\u2019s a number on the ring. Looks like someone\u2019s experiment. I don\u2019t like experiments unless I\u2019m told about them first.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he said. He looked at the numbers, which had the indifference of all numbers to what they have been forced to measure. He looked at the eye, which did not know of numbers. He thought of Blaise\u2019s little handheld crow, the parody of a morning, and his stomach made a private agreement with gravity that it would not be going up the hill again today.\n\nMhairi had him in her kitchen that week, which was mostly a room with a table and a wall, and on the wall hung not photographs but lists of things to pull and things to plant and underlined words like nettles, which are friends if you know them. She cut him a slice of something that was either cake or a moral in disguise and told him, \u201cThere\u2019s a place round by Kemnay where the bags are getting in frames. They\u2019re braided now and they\u2019ll want ta be curtains next. Ye ken how a house looks from the road if it\u2019s got curtains where there ought nae be? Like a lie. We\u2019ll go and take them down.\u201d She poured tea in two chipped mugs that had seen fingers from three decades of hands. \u201cWe\u2019ll tell the wind back to be wind. It\u2019ll sulk. Then it\u2019ll forget us and go to Orkney. That\u2019s its right.\u201d\n\nHe went with her and they found the curtains as she\u2019d promised\u2014old bags in new weaving, clever enough that you wanted to applaud and then stopped yourself because applause cements bad ideas into foundations. They cut them free with kitchen scissors and words and did not call it an exorcism. They left them in a pile on the roadside where a lorry would have to slow to avoid them, and Archie sent a van that was good at avoiding meant objects. The man driving it waved at them as if he had known them since birth, which in this town counted as probable.\n\nHe slept better even on the nights the wind tried his window. He woke less often certain he had drowned in a bowl. When he dreamed, sometimes he dreamed of his grandmother swatting him with a dishcloth and then kissing his hand as if the dishcloth were a formality she could live without.\n\nIt might have been three weeks after the jar that he stood in his lane at twilight closing the gate with its tired latch and he heard a little sound to his left. He turned and there, not four feet from him, near the hedge, the rooster from the picture had his head down and his foot stuck cocked as if it had sat too long with his weight on it. On the leg, above the spur, the ring. The bird saw him and made the throat-noise that is not warning and not welcome, the something in between that is what living is when you\u2019re not telling anyone. He held very still. He put his hand out as if to whatever god is in charge of birds and said, quiet, \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\nThe bird lifted its foot, put it down, lifted it again. He stepped closer in stages as if dancing. He could see the numbers now. The ring was not only plastic; it was plastic threaded with wire, a cheap trick from a dear mind. The wire had a tag. There were letters on the tag that made his stomach scald\u2014BC\u2014because of course a man like Blaise would not be content with the world knowing; he would need everything to know.\n\nHe did not grab. He did not pounce. He did the thing his grandmother had once taught him when catching an old hen in a coop: he made himself boring as winter. He let the bird consider him and come to the conclusion that he would, perhaps, in this one moment, allow interference. He put his hand on the leg in one swift soft press and felt the scaly heat of it and the terrible smallness. He took his penknife and slid it under the wire and snicked. The rooster made a sound like a swear from an old language and did not strike him because sometimes mercy makes even a stupid creature feel clever. The ring fell. He held it up between finger and thumb and the numbers showed their ugly teeth. He put it in his pocket without looking and stepped back at once so the bird did not have to be grateful, which would have insulted them both. It lifted, not very graceful, and dropped over the hedge into someone\u2019s garden, which was a fate he would not wish on roses but could not prevent.\n\nHe took the ring out in his kitchen under the light that never sulked because he had taught it good behaviour through shame and bribery. The tag had the BC. Under that, a number that was not a number but a date, and under that, very tiny, a line that read: COCKSPUR. He made himself laugh because the alternatives would have taken the night and wrung the sweetness from it. He put the ring in a jam jar like a trophy you hope no one will admire. In the morning he took it to Lyle and she put it in a bag that, for once, he did not mind, and she did her paperwork like a woman writing a poem about drains.\n\n\u201cWhat next?\u201d Archie asked him once on the street, which was his way of letting him know the town had stopped being amused and started being concerned. \u201cHe\u2019s in remand. He reads. Which I think should be illegal in certain cases, but I\u2019m told by my better angels that it is not. He\u2019ll be out before trial if the sheriff likes his pen. Ye ken how men with tidy hair make everything look as if it\u2019s not sticky. We\u2019ll have letters to the editor. We\u2019ll have his friends, the quiet ones, saying we\u2019re hard on innovation. We\u2019ll have boys who liked the way their hands felt doing a thing neat saying we stole their Saturday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next,\u201d Ewan said, \u201cis we make next. We go on doing the ordinary that nothing knows how to fight. We say please. We say enough. We say, will ye hold this end while I tie here. We sweep. We cut. We refuse to be impressed. We keep for ourselves the right to be astonished and not give it to any man who brings a label and a pen.\u201d\n\nArchie looked more tired and kinder than the first day Ewan had met him on a playground with a ball and the new sharp knowledge that other boys pick up and smash what scares them. \u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of sermon I can sit through. By the way, the third light\u2019s been behaving. Tell it I said thanks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d Ewan said, and went and told it, because compliments are a type of oil.\n\nThat evening he walked by the river and the bags were fewer in the hawthorn because people had got embarrassed, and embarrassment is a decent working tool if you use it to keep your hands out of what ought not be touched. The willow had shed a handful of yellow leaves that had the nerve to fall early as if to remind them all that nothing is theirs to schedule. A woman he did not know was teaching a child to skip stones with the moral seriousness such acts deserve. The stones mostly plopped. The woman did not say a swear word even once. He wanted to give her a medal.\n\nHe stood with his back against the fence and closed his eyes, and he could hear, with the jar not in his pocket and the river doing its manners and the wind out of a bottle and back where it was meant, the town\u2019s old noises: a gull practising contempt; a door gently refusing and then accepting; far off the football pitch sucking boys into the enormous machine that turns bodies into running and then back into chatter. He thought of the rooster. He thought of the jar on a shelf in a station that smelt of floor cleaner and cigarettes that men lied about. He thought of Blaise sitting in a room with a man making notes and deciding whether to be charming, whether to be sorry, whether to insist that the word he had been looking for all his life had been tidy. He thought of himself at ten falling into a bowl and coming up years later with river in his ears and swearing he would not listen. He thought of Mhairi\u2019s thorn, red-wound and then returned to the bush like a mistake he had been allowed to keep, and he let the day take him in where a house takes a draught\u2014a small gap under the door, purposive, useful, not to be mocked.\n\nHe went home. He went to bed. He woke before dawn to a darkness as familiar as his own worn boots and lay still. Out in the birches there was the breath the old cottage knew. Somewhere toward the Don a fox made its old sewing-machine noise. The air at his throat was good enough to drink. Far off, not near, not unkind, a rooster told the day to have some courage, and Ewan\u2019s magic, which was not a pet but a shape his life had taken, stretched like a cat and made itself large without making a show of it. He smiled once, a small thing, and the dark smiled back in its blank way. He said the three names and the folded line of the Don\u2019s course, and he slept two hours more because morning had asked; he had not told it what to be.",

Ewan found it halfway under the mat as if it had tried to come in of its own accord and then thought better of it. He lifted it between two fingers so as not to give it more of his hands than courtesy required and took it to the table where all things that wanted judging sat to learn their place. The writing was that same narrow neatness, a schoolroom\u2019s pride that thought itself a virtue, and the words arranged themselves as if queuing at a bus stop: Ewan Calder, curator of quiet\u2014because I am not a barbarian, I will not force conversation upon you in person. I am, by the council\u2019s grace, detained. I am, by my own lights, working. The river dreams me. The wind remembers me. The town is a machine that will accept the proper fuel if you prime it. You primed it the other way. How clever. I grudgingly admire. There is in the world a principle that hates slackness, that wishes things to be taut and make music. We are both servants of it. I send you, not a jar, but a game. Fold any three bags into a plait. Tie them so that a child could not pull them apart. Then think of a bird and say its name backwards and blow. If you are honest, it will hum. I require nothing from you. I only wish to register that tidy is a love the law does not understand. B.\n\nHe put the letter face down. He drank his tea. He turned it over again and read the words a second time because men are not better than cats; they go back to the door to see if it holds. He felt in the room a small bristle as if the cottage had decided it disliked being called a machine, and he soothed it with the flat of his palm on the table, palms making friends with wood as they are trained to do in decent houses. He took the letter to the stove and held it low, not to burn it yet\u2014he did not want Blaise\u2019s tidy smoke under his beams\u2014but to let it meet heat and consider whether it truly wished to be in his keeping.\n\nMhairi came round within the hour because rain has a way of telling her where to go, and because the town\u2019s Rota of Worry always had his name pencilled in. He set the letter for her on the table and she read, moving her lips a little as some old hands do because words sometimes need help getting out of their beds. \u201cHe\u2019s making spells that wear gloves,\u201d she said, sour as rowan. \u201cLetters are spells ye have to hold in your very eyes, which is worse than a jar because ye cannae put a lid back on words once they\u2019ve touched the bit in ye that thinks with pictures. We\u2019ll no keep it. We\u2019ll cut it up. We\u2019ll ask the rain to take the vowels.\u201d\n\nShe was as good as her instructions. She took her kitchen scissors out of her bag as if she\u2019d been buying onions and trimmed the letter into strips, then into small beige snow which she tipped into the saucepan she\u2019d brought without explanation. The water there smelled faintly of metal and leaves. She stirred with a spoon that had seen army soup and christening broth and mourners\u2019 tea. \u201cIf ye read a spell twice, ye\u2019ve let it have a chair at your table,\u201d she said, not looking up. \u201cYe read it once for warning. Ye read it a second time for pride. Ye dinna read it a third unless ye like company ye canna evict.\u201d She tipped the wet paper into her hand and squeezed it. The strips shivered and then softened and fell through her fingers back into the pot. \u201cWe\u2019ll have the rain keep the shape o the words and let the meaning go with the steam.\u201d\n\nOutside, the rain that had arrived with the letter did its ordinary work of making mistakes look pretty. On the path the hedgerow let a bag lift and put itself down again, dissuaded, perhaps, because the air smelled of vinegar and old iron and nobody likes to rust unnecessarily. Ewan felt gratitude to the day simply because it had decided not to be dramatic. He got his coat and walked Mhairi back toward the allotments, the two of them bent slightly into the weather like pen strokes with character.\n\nAt the gate the saucepan went to a hook where odd things hang in this town so they can be seen enough to be thought about and not so much that folk begin to ask if they can borrow them. Mhairi shook her hands dry and squinted at the sky in the way of a woman who has argued with it into her seventies and knows its tricks. \u201cYe\u2019ll have folk come in with jars of their own now,\u201d she said, not unpleased. \u201cAny numpty with a label thinks himself a scientist. We\u2019ll be polite and we\u2019ll throw their wee storms back into their big ones and tell wind to go do its rightful job, which is ta move but not tell folk what they are.\u201d\n\nIt was not a jar that came first. It was a mist like a clothesline. In July the haar is a visitor from sea with manners, usually; it arrives late, leaves early, and keeps its wet hands to itself. This came up the valley wrong-footed and went down into the shopping precinct as if it had lost an earring and would not leave till it found it. Moira\u2019s window went soft, and in that soft he saw for an instant that this fog wanted to hold sound the way a jar does, keep it in to admire later. The co-op door hissed its usual hiss at opening and the sound sat in the mist, heavy as soaked wool. Out on the pavement, a boy\u2019s laugh stayed near his mouth, swelled, and then sank like the heavy end of a seesaw. Ewan did the silly thing and put his hand out into the white as if feeling for a wall; the air pressed back slightly, as if it had learned recently that it could.\n\nHe threw his sense sideways and found the police station by the feeling of forms piled up in a small space. Inside PC Lyle\u2019s tidy had gone a little mad\u2014papers out, hairline a touch sweaty, a fan on a windowsill trying to make its own weather and failing. She looked up as he came in and did not say the apology some people think they owe if they are not under control. \u201cWe\u2019ve a breach,\u201d she said. \u201cHaar, the labelled kind. The jar I took off him\u2014the one says BOUGHT AND PAID\u2014wasn\u2019t properly sealed. I had it in a box in a box in a room with an attitude, and even so it decided it\u2019d like to see your town. The station stinks like old dishcloth. Archie\u2019s using the word seep like it owes him a drink.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is it?\u201d he asked, and she pointed with her pen because pens also get to be brave. In the evidence cabinet, behind shaming glass, sat Blaise\u2019s neat cylinder with its churchgoing lid. A wetness filmed the inside like breath on a mirror. Next to it, absurd as a farm at a tea party, was the rooster machine, tagged and bagged, which had come in with the rest of the objects from the garden centre. It was off. It looked sulky about that, which was nonsense for a thing with two batteries and a speaker that would not pass muster on a cheap toy.\n\nThe mist outside pressed its face to the window as if to see how the police file their air. Ewan rests his hands on the counter and felt the grit left by nights where angry men had banged their knuckles into it and said they weren\u2019t angry. He had three breaths. He knew it. He looked at the jar and imagined he could see a tide behind it. \u201cNo dawn,\u201d he said, because it mattered to tell the day what it wasn\u2019t. \u201cNo barrels. No hedges. Just a room that insists upon itself.\u201d He nodded at Lyle. \u201cOpen the cabinet. I\u2019ll open the jar. You count. Then I\u2019ll close it and you tape it like a library book someone\u2019s loved too hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, brisk, because she was the kind of person who will count three seconds for a man and not make a fuss after. She keyed the cabinet, and the door opened with that polite kui-chink that had been designed to make burglars feel bad. The fog at the window took interest, as if sound had been looking back at it from inside and it wasn\u2019t used to that rudeness. Mhairi was not here; he had to be his own thorn and thread.\n\nHe lifted the jar, feeling the re-used throb of it, and he made his breath into a shelf on which to put what came. The lid gave like something that had wanted to get through a little door too much and had bruised itself. Lyle said, even, \u201cOne. Two. Three,\u201d and he turned the lid at the same time as she said the last, because sometimes shutting a thing is not the opposite of opening it but part of the same act. The haar shouldered out and went for the corners like a cat in a new house; it smelt of coins and laundry and old apology. It pretended to want to stay as fog, but the room with its lists and clipped-on instructions and coffee in a council mug refused to be a harbour. Lyle put tape on the jar, round and round, a ridiculous secular exorcism, and the fog sighed and decided to look out the window instead, and then decided to be weather where it belonged.\n\nThey put the jar back like a child put back into their bed and Lyle leaned on her hands and said nothing about the hollow that had appeared under her cheekbones. \u201cArchie,\u201d she said then, and that one word meant a thousand lectures, two reports and a biscuit in a wrapper half-opened and put aside. \u201cI\u2019ll write that we did what we did twice as quick as the time will say we took.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Ewan said, and looked at the rooster machine as if it were a bomb. \u201cAnd don\u2019t let anyone give that to a charity shop. That\u2019s a curse-box. The first bairn who presses that as a joke will own mornings for a week and not like the rent.\u201d\n\nAfter the fog the town behaved itself with the rectangular cheeriness of bunting, and then it didn\u2019t. Moira\u2019s Morven got herself into a snare in the park that wasn\u2019t a snare, not quite; it was a dress of bread bags braided with tinsel beads to make a net that shone like a lie. The little dog, who had the temperament of a broken smoke alarm and the legs of a disgraced cutlery drawer, went in and could not find the way out because the shine confused her. Ewan was there because he goes where he sees corners that think too much of themselves, and this was a corner of air that had opinions. He picked up the net as if it had asked him to carry it over a puddle. It caught at his fingers in that small-nailed sucking way plastic learns when it has been praised beyond its character. He could not do the sugar trick here. The tinsel had made the whole into something like language\u2014a false one, the kind hyenas speak when they want to look like they\u2019re laughing.\n\nHe set his teeth in his mouth the way you do when you know someone will ask you to be more careful than your nature leans to. He looked for the motive in the motion. He found it where the two silver loops had been tied through a handle\u2014so neat, so prissy, a tie done by someone who has never taken a woven bag to the market in rain. He cut there, with a word sharp and very small, and the net lost its sentence and fell back into a basket of things it had been before. Morven squalled and leaped into Moira\u2019s arms, and Moira, who swore at bakers and angels alike when they deserved it, said a thank you that made the day clear its throat.\n\n\u201cSome bugger\u2019s trying to make Christmas with rubbish,\u201d she said, wiping her eyes like a woman who does not have tear ducts to spare. \u201cI\u2019ll set a trap o my own. A tray of sausage rolls with curses on them. See who falls.\u201d She glared at the net, now stupid on the grass. \u201cI ken a braid of good hair when I see one, and that\u2019s no it.\u201d\n\nThat night Ewan went to Bennachie again because it had not asked him and therefore he could bear it. He did not go to the top; he went to the shoulder where the wind stops telling you its important thoughts and remembers how to joke. He stood with his face ruft and counted. A crow from a distant yard; another, closer by the smallholding; a third, laughably muffled as if someone had stuffed a sleeve into a pipe. He let each into his chest and let each out. The hinge he had made of himself felt oiled and not at all like something that could trap fingers. He smiled, and on the path down he met a man with a child in a carrier who gave him the nod of a person who has forgotten that the day once came in without his permission.\n\nThe library made him a committee. He did not intend it so, but he pinned a note on the corkboard that morning\u2014Hinge Walk, Friday evening, meet at the sign, bring a bag only if you promise to take it home again\u2014and half the town came with their courtesy and their reluctance bundled together. Mrs. Bruce came with her hands like paper and a scarf that had musicians on it whose horns would have made Blaise fidget. Archie came because he hated anything that sounded like a movement and liked anything that looked like a route. PC Lyle came without her radio, which made her look naked and amused her that this was so. Jay came because being in a group where no one shouted and something got done had the new shine of a hobby he might keep. Mhairi came without explanation, with a stick tied with ribbon, and nobody asked in case saying would jinx it.\n\nThey walked the town\u2019s joints, the places where it leaned. The bridge where the river thinks about getting married to the other river and decides to remain itself; the underpass where teenagers perform the rite of complaining correctly about school; the corner by the co-op where wind likes to try on masks. At each they put their hands to stone or to metal or to the air itself and said small things that meant, You and me, we\u2019ve a deal. They took the bags they found and turned some to sugar and some to bowls around stones where the water immediately did a better job of deciding where it wanted to go. They wrote please on cards and left them in silly places like the crook of a drainpipe and the lip of a fence, and the cards were gone by morning because please is keen to be useful.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve made them all druids,\u201d Archie muttered, not displeased, dragging a tangle of white out of a privet hedge with the same precision he used to pin a barrier across the road where cows had got out. \u201cI\u2019ll get grief for this if someone breaks a wrist saying gentle to a bollard.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them,\u201d Mhairi said, tying her ribbon\u2019s end back on itself to make a thought. \u201cThe town\u2019s full of noise that thinks itself words. We\u2019re putting the words back under the noise where they belong.\u201d\n\nBlaise wrote again from wherever men who are not sure if they are the villain or the hero recline to build their next paragraph. This one came through the post proper, stamped with a belief in institutions. Ewan put it on the shelf for three days and when he opened it, it tried to cling to his fingers for gratitude. It boasted that a councillor had come to see him and said interesting; it boasted that a newspaper had called him an artist because the photographs of his chalk circles printed well. It boasted that he had followers in a larger town where the river did not mind being told what it was because people there kept putting lamps into it in remembrance and expected it to accept. It asked after Ewan\u2019s quiet and whether he had learned that asking the morning to call you by your own name is the only way to stop being battered by it. Ewan read it once and then folded it and put it not under the pan but under a book about washing greens and letting them sit, because it deserved that kind of boredom.\n\nThe station called him to look at a spill. It was not of oil. It was tea, and the way of it was melancholy. The receptionist, who had lately had her hair done and would have liked someone to say so without making a fuss of it, had knocked a mug over in the evidence room. The tea had run to the boxes and the boxes, being men\u2019s, had not been sealed as one always promises to seal. The tea had found a crack in the lid marked TILL SLEEZE and had taken in what was offered, as tea will. Now the dark on the lino had the unarguable lustre of an eye. Everyone was embarrassed. Lyle stood with her arms folded and looked as if she would like two more arms and a minute away with a packet of crisps and nobody asking.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go in with bare feet,\u201d Ewan said, because sometimes the obvious is a spell. \u201cYou\u2019ll come out hating your own toes.\u201d He crouched and set his fingers to the floor near but not in the tea and breathed on it as if cold. He remembered the bowl not as drowning but as a teaching, and he let his breath be three countable things. The tea looked back as if to accuse him of pretending it had never been necessary. He said, because you sometimes have to be stupidly plain to win certain arguments, \u201cEnough,\u201d and the men in the hall who liked to shout gave up one of the words they had learned from him without admitting it and let it go. The sheen dulled. The stain remained. He made himself smile because he had learned it soothed those who can\u2019t bear a mess they forgot to prevent. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have a mark there,\u201d he said to Lyle, gentle. \u201cYou might as well make friends with it.\u201d\n\nHer mouth did that thing it did when she was persuaded to be human when she would have preferred to be a desk. \u201cWe\u2019ll put a mat over it,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody will admit why.\u201d\n\nMornings grew their legs as the summer took to telling people it was busy elsewhere, and Ewan found himself waking earlier and not hating it by law. He had the jar in his keeping no more, which pleased him, and he had a small box of cardboard circles he cut out of cereal boxes on evenings when he needed the comfort of a small sharp thing, and on each he wrote words he did not justify: please, enough, later, now, hush. He gave them away to people who looked as if their own words had packed a bag and left. He tucked some under lampposts from which men liked to hang opinions. He slid one under the foot of the third light because it had begun to mind its manners without needing to be told and it deserved a tip.\n\nOn a Wednesday the sky turned the yellow you get when weather has been told by an office to be careful and has decided to obey by being noisy. Archie called it with relish a warning, which gave him leave to be everywhere and be helpful without being told no. \u201cIt\u2019s in off Peterhead,\u201d he said, which meant nothing and everything. \u201cLoose rubbish will go flying. I\u2019ll have men out with lorries. I\u2019ll have bairns told not to kite anything that looks like it\u2019s got a plug. Ye\u2019ll be using your mouth at people no doubt.\u201d He sounded tired and pleased because there are days when his work looks like exactly the thing someone made him for.\n\nThe wind came with that mean humour it sometimes gets near harvest. It wanted to remind everyone who is in charge of roofs. The hedges that have survived a dozen winters and two bad summers bent their backs. The bag nests in the places they had not yet found spoke up in a chorus and then were torn out of their cleverness and dragged across verges and into ditches. Up by the bypass, a thing like a kite got loose from the old garden centre roof\u2014the place sealed now and taped and labeled but still with corners\u2014and made for the carriageway like a saint for its martyrdom. It was a sail of proper bags stitched at their handles and turned into a letter that the town would have to read if it landed where men drive fast. Jay saw it because boys\u2019 eyes are better when there is trouble they can be useful with, and he did the thing even good boys rarely do without flinching; he ran to find an adult and brought that adult\u2014Ewan\u2014right to it.\n\nThey were a bad team and they were perfect. Jay held the sagging of the sail by one corner and swore under his breath like someone being careful of an old china teacup. Ewan went for the knot, always the knot, and found that the man who had tied this one did not love knots for themselves but for what they could make others do, and that is the sort easiest to unfasten if you insult it. He said nonsense to it. He said ugly. He said you are not a net, you are a group project that got out of hand. He said please, at the end, because he is himself, and the knot gave up in a sulk and the sail fell on them and then around them, and then the wind, liking a joke, lifted the vast plastic sheet like a theatre cloth and slapped it into the layby, where Archie\u2019s van came as if conjured and put a wheel on the corner of it like a man pinning down a drunk.\n\nOn the other side of the dual carriageway, a crow-box crowed, ridiculously loud in its bravado, from someone\u2019s porch\u2014a copycat or a leftover, who knew\u2014and Ewan felt the hinge in him look over, see nothing that required it, and go back to its breakfast. He pressed his hands to the plastic as if it were an overexcited child and told it in the tone he used for boys with triangles that the performance was over. Jay sat down hard in the wet verge and put his hand over his eyes and laughed. It sounded exactly like relief and nothing like triumph, which made Ewan want to bless him and instead made him say, \u201cRowie?\u201d\n\nMoira had rowies because anyone with sense stocks carbohydrates when the weather means to speak in capital letters. She handed them out at the corner where the walk cut short and the older men liked to stand to see what\u2019s going. \u201cWe\u2019ll call it a festival,\u201d she said, covering the pot with a towel because towels are a kind of mercy. \u201cFestival o Taking Things Down. The things\u2019ll sulk. Then they\u2019ll forget they ever got above their station.\u201d\n\nThe wind unbuttoned the day and then thought better of it, seeing it had pulled enough. By evening the bins had bruises but the fences had not flown. Children went out to look at where things now sat that had no business sitting there and made of it a treasure hunt. Archie, whose heart preferred a neat grid, allowed it so long as nobody took the cones away from the places where men would be with trucks. PC Lyle walked with her hands in her jacket pockets and looked at everything as if she was collecting names for later. At the allotments, plants that needed staking got it, plants that would not benefit from useful help were left with the dignity of falling over on their own.\n\nEwan went home into a house that had remembered how to hold itself against a shout. He shut the door; the latch made its particular noise of I have your back. He put his hands under the cold as he had learned to do because pain, properly administered, can be a leash on lesser pain. He leaned his forehead against the window and watched the lane\u2019s own little festivals\u2014a bag doffing itself as if in apology, a milk carton wedged under a car tyre like a sulking child, the young ash on the verge dancing because it has to. He listened hard because habit is a kind of addiction, and he knew what the morning would bring; even after a storm, roosters tell the truth. He smiled, not showing his teeth, because tonight he did not need them.\n\nBlaise wrote again, as men who fancy themselves protagonists will, but the letter came folded into itself in that way that suggests the hand that folded it had nothing else to do and wanted you to know it. He left it in the hedge. Ewan saw it because the hedge had an expression and he had learned to read shrubs. He took it and did not take it in the house. He put it under a stone where rain could get to it slowly and worms at their leisure. He did not read. He let himself wonder for a whole minute what in it was meant for him and not for the writer, and then the minute was over and he went and made tea and put three circles on the table in a row\u2014please, enough, later\u2014and the arrangement was so exactly what he felt he laughed aloud and the cottage took it with the grace of old timber.\n\nThe week came back to its ordinary singing. Babies were born and had their names put under G and K and W by someone with a pen and neat wishes. The old woman by the window came and not-read and, one day, reached and put the tip of one paper finger on the glass and tapped and said, with huge courtesy, \u201cThank ye,\u201d which brought tears to his face because it meant nothing and everything. The boy Jay stood up under a triangle and announced that the shape had ceased to be rude to him, which is the kind of victory men will ruin if they name too loudly. Archie came to the library with a clipboard and had it taken out of his hand by the quiet and returned to him with a small bruise of reflection. PC Lyle sent him a photograph of the place on the floor with the stain and the mat over it and wrote under it, Mother says you never put a mat over a problem. I say, not if you forget it\u2019s there.\n\nUnder that photograph he pinned, silently and without superstition, one of his circles. Hush, it said, and he did, because not talking is sometimes better than any cleverness he might wield. The rooster in the lane crowed at wrong times and right times, and the hinge did its patient work and did not require thanks. In the river, a bag from somebody\u2019s big shop came under the bridge and aimed itself for the reed bed with an intelligence it did not own. He put his hand over the rail and shook his fingers once and it failed to climb into meaning, falling away into its smaller selves. The wind printed itself against the side of the house and read itself there like a child at a library board pointing with a fat finger at letters it knows and making them into a story, and he was content to correct nothing while the day tried.\n\nIn late afternoon one thunderhead rolled in with the petulance of a god who missed devotion and meant to make of the skylight a platform. The light in the library became a lake held in the ceiling. The third tube did not sulk; it held its nerve like a thoughtful witness. Mrs. Bruce did not budge from her chair. The lads came and asked if he had any book where the hero was not an idiot about girls, and he gave them two and a half and they said, concentrated, that would do. He filed a jar in his mind that he did not intend ever to make and labelled it UNDERSTANDING, FOR WHEN YOU CAN BE BOTHERED, and he laughed at himself because being a man in a town is like that; you are given labels and you invent the rest.\n\nHe went home with fresh things for supper and found at his gate, not on it, not theatrical for once, the rooster, which scratched the dirt with a nonsense innocence and did not look at him beyond the way animals look to see if you are about to be coarse. Its leg bore no ring. Its eyes had the worldly vulgarity of chickens and the good luck. He stood and counted his breath and then, because he could and not because he had to, he said aloud into a lane that made a habit of minding other folk\u2019s business, \u201cGood evening,\u201d and the bird flicked a bit of grit at his boot and stalked off with no ceremony at all. It was exactly the correct courtesy.\n\nAfter dark, he lay on his bed with the door open to the hall and the window cracked, letting the sound of what little rain there was sort itself. He said again the three names and the fold of the Don and the words were muscle rather than prayer. He slept and woke and slept, and in the thin hour when once you climbed out of bed to sit on the floor because your throat had been stolen by a bird and the world was too hinge and not enough door, he turned on his side and the night did not argue. Far off, a cockerel, not the lane one, not any particular one, did its opinion, and down in the centre of him something ordinary agreed without fanfare. He looked, just before going under again, at the little circles on the table that he had forgotten to put away and thought, without making a plan, that the next one would have to say sorry, and that he would learn where to place it.",

Roof slates lay where they always meant to, not on the pavement telling stories about gravity. In his kitchen, with the kettle finding its note, Ewan cut a circle from a cereal box and wrote sorry on it in his best small hand. It didn\u2019t look much beside please and enough and later on the table\u2014sorrier than the word suggested, in fact\u2014but the cardboard took the ink without flinching. He set it aside as if it were the kind of bread you don\u2019t slice till someone hungry sits down.\n\nA thick envelope had come from the council stamped with a logo of a stylized tree that would never, in its life, put a root where it might meet a stone. Inside there were two requests that irritated each other like grains of sand under a lid. The first was sensible and had Lyle\u2019s lean handwriting in the margins: would he attend a school assembly at the academy to talk about \u201ccitizenship around materials,\u201d which was a way to say to lads, do not carry handles round your wrists as if you are apprentices to a saint. The second was printed and aspirational and had a councillor\u2019s signature underneath and the politely deluded smell of a new initiative about it: an evening forum on \u201cTidy as Love,\u201d a public discussion with \u201cstakeholders\u201d about what art is when it\u2019s made from what people throw away. The name Blaise did not appear, which meant it had put on a jacket and gone by itself.\n\nHe put both letters under the magnet shaped like a carrot and watched them try to hold still. The cottage hummed faintly with disapproval of meetings, which it considered less honest than weather, and he patted its sill like a dog\u2019s flank. The sorry circle looked at him with the simultaneous humility and pride of all apologies worth making. He pocketed it with a small braced breath and went out because the lane required him.\n\nMoira hailed him from the bakery door, hair clamped under a scarf that had croissants where there ought to be flowers. \u201cHae ye seen the drains?\u201d she called, as if drains were a show you could buy tickets to. \u201cDown by the square. Nae running right. Archie\u2019s away wi himself and no wrong. There\u2019s\u2026 filters. That\u2019s what the lads are calling em.\u201d She made a face as if the word had got sugar in it and turned wrong.\n\nHe found Archie at the corner where the buses nose in and out and old men keep their weather inside their coats until somebody asks. The hi-vis vest made him look like a lighthouse someone had parked. He was on his knees with a gully lifter and a humourless patience, pulling up from the throat of the drain a handsome horror\u2014three braided carriers made into a bandage and fitted with a frame that had been cut from a fruit crate and tied in, clever, with bits of free municipal string. \u201cJesus,\u201d he said conversationally without looking up. \u201cHe\u2019s invented a flood.\u201d\n\nThe thing had a mind in the vulgar way of all objects to whom men attribute care. It clung, not with teeth, but with the logic of a person who has convinced himself he is helping and now will not stop. Jay stood a pace back with a litter picker and the earnestness of a volunteer who is determined to make good the phrase good intentions. PC Lyle had a map on a clipboard and a pen behind her ear and was making a list of grates that would argue.\n\nEwan crouched, breathing river and heat from the tarmac. The woven filters had the same problem as Blaise\u2019s curtain had: they were trying to make themselves into something with a purpose nobler than their nature could hold. He slid his fingers under the band and felt where motive sat, which was in the knot that bound the pretty to the useful. \u201cShy bairns get nowt,\u201d his grandmother\u2019s voice said in his head, and he said, so small the drain could pretend he hadn\u2019t spoken, \u201cPlease,\u201d and then, because this was not only about asking nicely, \u201cEnough.\u201d He put the sorry circle against the metal of the grate, just under the lip where nobody would see unless they were in the habit of putting their names where they must be rubbed by other people\u2019s steps. The net went slack in a way that was not defeat so much as a decision to be heavy. Archie, feeling it, swore with relief that would have made any communion wine curdle and got the thing out with a wet slide.\n\n\u201cBairns\u2019ll think this is good civic spirit,\u201d he grumbled, not unkind. \u201cFiltering.\u201d He spat the word into the gutter as if it had a taste. \u201cThen the sky\u2019ll fall down and they\u2019ll be first to kick the council for not having gills ready.\u201d He thumped the grate back into place and nodded to Lyle. \u201cWe\u2019ll do the one by the bank next,\u201d he said, as if he had always known where every vulnerable mouth in the town lay.\n\nA cockerel crowed then from a garden up the hill\u2014real bird, not box, with the throatiness of a thing that doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s making music ancient and daft. Ewan felt the hinge open politely and close itself again without offence. He had a palm flat on cold metal, and cold metal was as good as any Psalm for a man who believed in the physics of decency. The morning did not turn to glass. It obliged, said its say, and was quiet again in exactly the way a good sentence is.\n\nThey worked along the street in a clumsy procession\u2014two lads with barrows for whatever they pulled, two old men who had seen water in war and did not mask their advice, a girl of nine holding the roll of bin bags like a scepter because she had been allowed to be useful. Archie muttered filters, filters, as if he might summon by charm the places they were. Lyle put a tick where they'd been and a question mark where the map had never been trusted. Jay, careful, pressed his heel on the corner of a bag and shook his hand like a magician\u2019s assistant when a tail refuses to come free. People stopped and watched and were not unkind about it; they do that here, admire quiet work with the sort of approval that is almost an apology for how rarely it gets done in front of them.\n\nAt the school the assembly had the smell of varnish and wet hair. The hall was the colour of sports and a little ennui, a reasonable size for hospitality and for heartbreak. Ewan stood at the front where a deeply optimistic mural had painted girls and boys passing a globe between them as if the earth were a ball that needed exercise. He held up a triangle he\u2019d cut from card\u2014just a triangle, three equal sides, the sort that has always insisted the world be precise\u2014and he saw four hundred faces lean as if they wanted it to be a trick.\n\n\u201cThree breaths,\u201d he said, and the teachers, to his satisfaction, obeyed more quickly than the students did. \u201cOut loud if ye like. In your head if ye prefer. One, two, three.\u201d The room acquitted itself of air like a choir told to begin again. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe clever word for it is hinge. It\u2019s the bit in between. Magic likes the bit in between, but so do we, we just pretend we don\u2019t. Anyone brings you a clever thing and says it will tidy the world and you don't need to think about it, you say, I\u2019ll take three breaths and then I\u2019ll act. It\u2019s not heroic. It\u2019ll make the right lads think you\u2019re a wet blanket. Do it anyway.\u201d\n\nA boy at the back crowed then\u2014because if you tell young males not to play with sound, you make it delicious\u2014and for a moment the room trembled as if it intended to be an arena. Ewan put his hand up not to silence so much as to tip the room back into itself. \u201cAye,\u201d he said, \u201cbird says morning. We do not put it in a jar for later. We do not make dresses out of the mess and pass them round as if we\u2019ve invented fashion. We get up. We go to school. We do our three breaths. We pick up what we dropped. We dinna make nets that catch what never hurt us.\u201d\n\nJay stood to his feet without meaning to and in that motion there was the whole reason adults put on ties and ask boys to sit still. \u201cHe said we were menders,\u201d he called, because there\u2019s no point pretending a shared mistake isn\u2019t excellent company. \u201cHe said the wind liked it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd wind will always say it likes whatever it\u2019s just been given,\u201d Ewan said. \u201cIt\u2019s greedy, wind. It\u2019ll say it loves a new noise because new is tasty. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t take wind\u2019s first opinion. You take your three breaths. You listen to your gran. You ask the river if it would like to swallow what you\u2019ve braided for it.\u201d There was a ripple of laughter for river as if he had made it a teacher on relief, and the relief was good. \u201cIf you see a bag that wants to be sugar,\u201d he added, \u201cshake your hand and call me. If you see a net where there was not a net, cut it. Care is a knot that makes someone free, not stuck.\u201d\n\nHe pressed the triangle flat against his palm. The hall breathed because he had asked it to. He set down three cardboard circles on the piano as if he were laying out biscuits and the children leaned as they do when a trick is going to be given away and then turned into a better trick in their own pockets. \u201cPlease,\u201d he said, tapping the first. \u201cEnough.\u201d He put his fingertip on the second. \u201cAnd this one, you\u2019ll hate it, you\u2019ll think it\u2019s soft, but it will save you when you have done harm because any human does, and it\u2019ll save your pal when you mean to be good and you were not. Sorry. Not the cheap kind. The kind that says, I did it, I won\u2019t do that one again, and I\u2019ll fix what I can. That third word is a grown-up. Nobody wants to adopt it. But if you carry it, the world will lend you its arms when yours are tired.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, at the forum in the Town Hall with the stack of metal chairs and the carpet that remembered the feet of mayors, the councillor with hair that believed in combs did his best with tidy as love. He used graphs and pictures of bins smiling, and he did not say the word Blaise, which meant he said it more than he intended. In the row behind, two women who loved their gardens with violence nodded when he said community art, and the man from the paper sharpened his pencil with a knife whose blade had been polished on a lifetime of meetings. Lyle wore a dress under her jacket that looked like she had reluctantly bought it and then had grown fond of it because it did as asked. Archie, who had no intention of speaking, had been given a roving microphone and held it like a man who would rather hold a hammer and yet could not resist the weight of it.\n\nMhairi did not sit. She stood at the back with her basket and her scarf tied tight under her chin and looked, as always, like the warning at the end of a fairytale that the children only half hear because they\u2019ve been sent to bed. The councillor opened the floor. A man with a voice like a clean desk said he had been to Glasgow and seen installations made from plastic bottles that made him feel uplifted, and a student with fringe and opinions said art should be allowed to be naughty if it taught, and then a woman Ewan did not know said her wee spaniel had come home with a necklace of rings and she had thought him cute until the vet told her the word embedded.\n\n\u201cYe can make each other uncomfortable with your clever,\u201d Mhairi said into the space between the microphone being offered and her disagreeing with its existence, and the words went to the far corners of the hall the way chickens do when a shadow passes. \u201cBut you dinna tell a river to agree with your art. Ye dinna tell wind what noise it makes. If ye tie a knot make sure whatever ye\u2019ve tied can walk after it. If it cannae, cut it. Leave your tidy to your drawers and your mind, not to the throats o birds.\u201d\n\nA boy near the front pressed something in his hand out of mischief or loyalty, and the crow-box in his jacket pocket gave a cheap shout. The sound was thin, the way a brag dwindles when faced with someone\u2019s grandmother. It raised the hair at the back of Ewan\u2019s neck as old voices do. He set his shoulders to the hinge and let the cheap morning go through and out. There was a murmur in the room like the beginning of a hymn, and Mrs. Bruce, who had surprised everyone by being there, hummed Cwm Rhondda under her breath like a floorboard that knows its tune. The little device sulked as objects do when ignored properly.\n\nThe councillor made his resolution with treacle and care: that there should be evenings of untying for anyone who wanted to make their hands honest; that drains would be checked in the kind of rota that pleases a certain type of man so that the rest of us can forget what the word gully means; that young folk who liked the feel of weaving would be given bales of old rope and told the correct, ancient, useful knots to make, and someone, not Ewan, christened the project Hush Rope, which made the room pleased and awkward and willing. Lyle stood, mercifully brief, and said harm was harm even if you had a label, which is all the law can say when the town wants to be romantic. Archie said a word about responsibility that was less a word than a look. The student with the fringe waited afterwards to say that he had thrown his crow device in a bin, which was polite and not enough, and Mhairi, who had seen more bins than most, said, take the batteries out first, son, and the boy looked grateful for being given specifics.\n\nHe walked the long way home because after talking plain you should let your words lie down in the grass. He stopped at a gate he had not touched since the day of the Tupperware, and his hand did what it had wanted to do in the memory and hadn\u2019t\u2014rested there, flat, respectful as if on a forehead. The Knoxes were in the yard with their hands where all good hands are in the evening\u2014on small wood and stubborn hinges. Mrs. Knox, headscarf in a print of strawberries that had usurped the season, waved. \u201cWe moved em last month,\u201d she said, before he could say anything. \u201cThe birds. Ye dinna need to walk the long way now if it\u2019s just that. It was nae bother.\u201d She said it in the tone of a woman trying to make a kindness small enough that it can be received.\n\nHe stepped in with the gait of a man who has come to ask a thing he cannot ask without also admitting to the shape of his fear. The cockerel in the yard was a handsome idiot named Rab\u2014Mrs. Knox told him with a pride she would have been ashamed to show about a son. Rab had a smutted comb and the look of a creature whose brain is busy as a pea rolling in a cup, which is to say busy enough. He strutted, as all roosters are condemned to do by something the priests probably named pride, and he did his morning even though it was evening because chickens do not own watches. The sound came out with the scaffolding showing and the ridiculous lilt and the old necessity, and Ewan stood about two yards from it and put his hand\u2014just to say he was here\u2014on the door of the coop. His hinge opened and closed. It did not try to take the whole day in. It was content with three breaths. It was, he realized with a jolt that left beauty behind like a found coin, not an enemy. It was a clock.\n\n\u201cI came to say sorry,\u201d he said to Mrs. Knox and to the bird and to the air and to the boy he had been who had tipped a bowl into panic and never forgiven the morning for having a throat. \u201cI\u2019ve made ye into a god I cannot meet. It\u2019s only noise. It\u2019s only the time. I\u2019m learning my manners.\u201d Mrs. Knox looked at him with the practical love good women have for men who are late to their own truths and patted his arm with the hand that has fed dogs and babies and uncooperative men. \u201cAye well,\u201d she said. \u201cYe\u2019ll come for eggs then. That\u2019s manners enough.\u201d\n\nThere was plastic twine on their fence, the bright orange kind that insists on itself like a shout, so he asked if he might remove it and she said, relieved, that she had been pretending it did not make the apples anxious. He worked with his penknife and with the rhythm of a man untying the world out of a habit that will never stop. He replaced the twine with a length of rope that had come from the first Hush Rope night\u2014good sisal, scratchy with honesty\u2014and heard the fence ease. Inside the coop he tucked his sorry circle onto a nail, hidden, silly, reverent, and Rab, confounded, pecked at his boot with a conversational sort of insult. It was exactly the right absolution.\n\nLater, at the allotments, Mhairi had her stick laid across her knees and a rowan sapling in a pot she had acquired in a way that had not involved asking for a receipt. \u201cFor the place we took the thorn,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing taken stays taken if we can help it.\u201d They went down to the bend and found the hawthorn in its politer mood, the blossom gone, the berries thinking their red into being. They planted the rowan legal and not, with a spit of earth and a blessing too plain to note. The sapling\u2019s leaves had the new green that is never very long. \u201cI stole that lad\u2019s bowl once,\u201d she said, while they patted soil where roots would persuade themselves to be. \u201cYour gran. Did she no tell ye? We were fourteen and immortals. We took her east-water and poured it just to prove we could. The morning had us for a month. We missed the bus to school and the bus to sense. That\u2019s why she hit ye with a cloth that time. She knew the flavour o drowning in a teaspoon. She wasna punishing ye. She was asking the day to give ye back.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because the hurt and the help were knotted and there was no teasing one from the other without cutting the rope. The rowan looked like belief you could put your hand on. He promised it, ridiculously, that he would do his part of the compact and not ask it to do more than its leaves could hold. Mhairi\u2019s breath came short after they\u2019d pressed the earth and he found himself fussing, which she accepted in the way of a woman who knows there is pleasure meant in it. \u201cI\u2019m tired enough to let ye,\u201d she said, mock-virtuous. \u201cDunnae go soft. It\u2019s nae flattering at my age to be treated like a glass that thinks itself crystal.\u201d\n\nThe forum had left the town taut and then softened; that was the way with talk. Hush Rope nights grew into the sort of thing you can put on a calendar without the town mocking you. Children learned to tie bowlines and told their mothers what a marlinespike was and won the right to say it in the house. The drains, bored of drama, lay with their mouths open and were not fed. Someone hung a length of braided old feed-bag rope across the mouth of a gap in a fence where a child would otherwise be tempted to fall, and Archie wrote an email with one less swear than he might have used to thank them. PC Lyle came to a Hush night and tied a knot so elegant you would have mistaken it for a jewel if you didn\u2019t know better, and when someone clapped, she bore it as if clapping were a misdemeanor she would let slide this once.\n\nBlaise went quieter. His letters still came, folded into origami of their own significance. Ewan did not read them. He learned to feel them from the other room the way a dog knows the sound of his own name in the mouth of someone who means to ask him for tricks. He slid one under a potted geranium because plants like drama if it\u2019s at the right distance, and promised the cottage that when it was time to burn paper, he would make a festival of it.\n\nOn a Friday the flat light came back with its old Highland thrift and he set out toward Bennachie with his usual comfort\u2014early enough that the day could be had for company without being made to sing. Halfway to the corner where the scarf hung on the sign, he stopped because the world had offered him a gift he was not good at accepting: stillness so complete it was not a silence but an agreement to tell the truth. The river went about its business as if he were not there. The wind had taken itself to the hill and was laughing there with the rocks like old men at a funeral who can\u2019t help themselves. In the hedgerow, a bag had gone, or been made, to be a flower\u2014you could see the care in the way the handles had been twisted to a calyx. It tried, even in stillness, to suggest it would be beautiful if only you softened your eyes. He put his hand out and shook his fingers once, and the effort left it like a sigh leaves a child who has decided to sleep after all.\n\nAt night he left the window open that inch the cottage and he had agreed was enough. He lay as he did, counting the hinges in him instead of sheep. Somewhere, maybe at the far edge of the Garioch, a rooster took up his part. Ewan opened and shut and opened again, and in the gap he remembered to ask for nothing clever. He thought of the card on the table waiting for its moment, and he thought of to whom he would give it. He thought of Mrs. Knox, of Jay, of Archie, of Lyle, of Mhairi smiling like a ruin that refused to be picturesque. He thought, for the first time without bitterness, of Blaise in a room with white paint on it making neat pen marks on paper and putting sentences in a row like tins on a shelf. He thought, because he had learned the trick and because he had finally stopped thinking it showed weakness, of his own name said back to him by morning in a tone that neither mocked nor begged and called it good.\n\nIn the morning he put the sorry circle in his pocket and walked down to the water and pressed it under the rail where the lads sometimes leaned to spit their talk into the river. He said nothing out loud because sometimes the river is not in the mood for your voice. He stood a long while at the Bass, the two streams making their agreement the old way, and he did not ask the day to be better than it meant to be. He did not ask to be forgiven. He offered himself up instead like a man at a threshold who is decent enough to wipe his feet. Beyond the willow a heron made its patient line, and then, righteous as a line can be, lifted into the noise we insist on calling sky. He watched it, and when he went back to the library the third light, unasked, did its job. The boys came for triangles and argued with him about whether shapes can be fair. Mrs. Bruce tapped the glass once, a punctuation. The door breathed. The town went on tying and untying itself.\n\nAt the end of the day, with the notices set in their pockets, he found under the mat a thin envelope without pride. He did not take it in. He opened it on the step and let the lid of the world be the table. Inside there was a scrap, not neat, torn from a page that had lost its margins. The writing was still Blaise\u2019s but a little tired at the edges, as if a man had written without a ruler, which encouraged Ewan for no reason he could name. It said only: do you still think the morning is unkind. Under it, a blot where the pen had hesitated, a little human.\n\nHe held the paper so the light did not make more of it than it was, and for once he had the right answer ready before the question could whisper him into thinking it needed a speech. He took out a circle, not sorry, not please. He had made a new one that week in a moment of kitchen hubris and not regretted it since. He wrote the word on the back of the letter and slid it under the mat where Blaise\u2019s polite theft had left a space. Enough, it said, and for the first time he felt the word not as a stop but as a completion. He shut the door and the latch made its old faith statement. Out beyond the birches someone\u2019s rooster, generous fool, did his duty, and in his bed Ewan\u2019s laugh, a small breathy thing, was accepted by the dark without charge.",
