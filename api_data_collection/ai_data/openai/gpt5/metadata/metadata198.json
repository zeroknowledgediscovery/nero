     "novel_text": "On the morning the last post arrived, a motorcade of black cars threaded down First Avenue and left a smell like wet copper and banana peels. The city had learned not to watch, but windows fluttered anyway. The people had learned not to speak, but a word trembled in the throat of the city and touched every dental filling. Evan Saye listened to it thrum through the radiator and into the desk where he sat trying to finish a simple form, a requisition for archival boxes, a job made impossible by the tremor of his name threaded all through a letter he would not read.\n\nHe had a drawer that stuck on humid days. He had a drawer that he had measured once, nervously amused by its exact width: the span of his father's hand from thumb to little finger, splayed. He had a drawer that contained twenty-seven letters, all written by a person who didn't exist, dated from years that had not yet happened, addressed to a house he had not yet inherited. The drawer was a minor character in the apartment\u2014old wood, the color of burned tea\u2014and it had a way of being louder than it should be. When the motorcade passed, when the hum touched the copper pipes, the drawer rattled once. Short. Rude. A cough from a sick child in a library.\n\n\u201cYou hear it?\u201d Mina asked from the doorway without stepping into the room, which had always been his room and not anyone else's room, even when she slept on the futon and made jokes about the fan growling like an injured bear. She still folded herself into liminal spaces; she had a reporter's posture, feet ready to retreat.\n\n\u201cI hear it,\u201d he said.\n\nMina looked older in the gray light. Not older than she was, just older than she had been the last time he saw her. She had a scarf and the scarf had feathers printed on it. Feathers felt dangerous now. Feathers meant you were remembering birds in a time when their absence was a daily headline, always down below the fold, because other stories bit first.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re changing the guard,\u201d Mina said, pushing her voice low, conspiratorial, although everything conspiratorial had been dragged into daylight and given press conferences. \u201cThe signet car is here. He\u2019s going to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cPrimarch Thale.\u201d\n\nEvan\u2019s mouth went dry. Thale was the ape you could recognize even in words, even without a photograph: sentences like knuckleprints, shipments of declaratives. The late-night shows had tried to mock his cadence and failed. You couldn\u2019t parody gravity.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll go to the Dome,\u201d Mina said, \u201cand he\u2019ll do that thing where he makes himself small first. They always do that. They claim the human gesture before they grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d Evan said, and he didn\u2019t know why he said it. It meant nothing. It meant the opposite of what it meant. It meant something that he had not allowed into daylight, something his father\u2019s letters had hinted at without quite writing down.\n\nMina moved to the window. \u201cYou could come,\u201d she said, the way she had said it three times a week for the last three months. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide forever. It\u2019s just a speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not coming to see them. You\u2019re not doing your work. You\u2019re not seeing anyone but me and June, and June is on call half the week. You tell me what that is if not hiding.\u201d\n\nHe had learned to be careful with his voice, to keep it slow and soft. He chose silence\u2014his stupid new trick\u2014and turned toward the rattling drawer. It rattled again as if prompted by his attention. He placed his palm on it. He told himself he felt nothing. He told himself he felt a coolness like a winter coin. Both were true. That's not even how physics works, you said? Well.\n\n\u201cI brought pastries,\u201d Mina added, and swung a paper bag into the air. It had a grease stain in the shape of the continent the schoolchildren called The Lost Country on their contraband maps, the maps that still included glaciers drawn like sleeping dogs. \u201cIf you don't eat I\u2019ll tell June.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always tell June.\u201d\n\nMina turned from the window, but her gaze snagged on the drawer, because it had a way of snagging gazes. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Too quick. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to open it, Evan. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\n\nHe hadn\u2019t thought she was stupid. He had thought she was braver than he was, and braver than that again, and she had amulets against her own bravery: her little jokes, her scarf, the way she kept stepping back from thresholds. He had thought that if he asked her to leave, she would know something dangerous, and if he asked her to stay, she would know something dangerous, and this is what choice feels like.\n\n\u201cYou never told me,\u201d Mina said. She balanced the paper bag on the arm of the chair, like a juggler finishing her act. \u201cNot what he wrote, not really.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wrote everything,\u201d Evan said, surprised by the accuracy of the words as they left him. He realized he had been wanting to say exactly that since his father\u2019s funeral, when the sky had been white and hot like bone. \u201cHe wrote more than everything. He wrote through it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world,\u201d he said, and then had to laugh, because the way he said it sounded like someone else, sounded ridiculous and pretentious and a little like the university professor he had once wanted to be. Mina smiled without humor.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re going to eat croissants,\u201d she said, \u201cand then the Primarch will speak.\u201d\n\nEvan loved that she could paste a day together like that matter-of-factly. He went to the kitchen and filled the kettle. He listened to the water shape the kettle tin. When he opened the drawer with the tea bags it stuck, not like the letter drawer but with its ordinary bad fit. He let it stick. He watched his hands making tea and thought of them as other people\u2019s hands, or the hands of a small boy who had been taught to be careful with boiling water. Once, he had had strong opinions about the correct way to make tea. He had opinions about whether the kettle should be metal or ceramic or early plastic. There was a comfort in that pettiness he could not find now.\n\nWhen he came back, Mina had guessed. He knew she had guessed because she had not looked at the drawer directly; she had given it the respectful inattention we reserve for sleeping dogs and unexploded shells. She had unwrapped the pastries and put them on a plate. She had turned on the radio. It ate the room with its comfortable voices, made the apartment seem like a normal apartment with a normal radio at nine-thirty in the morning. The music was borrowed from the old days, strings recorded in a hall half the width of the sea.\n\nThe announcer said the words. \u201cPrimarch Thale will now address the demonstrators gathered at the Dome. The Primarch is accompanied by Minister of Harmony Luwena Creel and the Human Envoy, Marshal Deems.\u201d\n\nThe last name was a mouthful of ash. Mina\u2019s eyes flicked to Evan and away. Marshal Deems had been his mother\u2019s friend, in another life, before the Departments were merged and the animal study programs rerouted and renamings happened like small earthquakes. Marshal in this case meant no armies, meant a collar and a medal in the shape of a fig leaf.\n\nThey listened to footsteps. A murmur rose like smoke and was cut clean in the middle as if edited. Thale\u2019s voice began where human voices end; it had a bass note that you couldn't play with instruments, only with the body.\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d Thale said, and paused, as if tasting the syllables. \u201cAnd not-people. Today is the day we say the same thing. We are present. We are present. We are present.\u201d\n\nMina made a face that said both ugh and wow, which is not an easy face to make. Evan put his hand on the letter drawer again. It was warm this time. He pulled it open a finger\u2019s width and let the smell come out. Old paper is vanilla, decay and sun and glue. These letters did not smell like that. They smelled like snow and something else: the bitter bite of the first peel of an orange.\n\nThale continued. \u201cYour maps are ours. Your water is ours. Your cities are ours. And your stories\u2014oh, your stories\u2014were never yours alone. We have been in your government from the beginning. We were at your first votes and your last. We were the quiet ones who carried the boxes and watched the counters. We counted, and we waited, and we have come to claim our place. Not as invaders. As residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolite, isn\u2019t he,\u201d Mina said to the air, because if she had directed the comment to Evan, it would have been too dangerous.\n\n\u201cI remember when they were funny,\u201d Evan said before he could help himself. \u201cRemember? The day they filmed Primarch Tallo trying on a tie and getting it around his head like a visor?\u201d He winced. He could hear it: the warm, nostalgic cadence of someone remembering a harmless television clip from a gentler time. There had been no gentle time. The clip had been an insertion. We had been coaxed.\n\n\u201cYou can admit it was funny,\u201d Mina said. \u201cI mean, it was. It doesn\u2019t change\u2014what you just said.\u201d\n\nThale was speaking again. \u201cWe are much the same. We love our young. We are tired when the day is done. We share fruit. We tell stories in the long dark. We have learned your contracts and your customs. We have signed our names in your blue ink. We have watched you err and err and err, and we do not find you intolerable.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice,\u201d Mina said. \u201cNice of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he practiced that line a lot,\u201d Evan said.\n\n\u201cMarshal Deems will now say something,\u201d the announcer whispered as if gossiping in class. \u201cHe will assure us of cooperation across\u2014\u201d\n\nEvan turned the radio off. The sudden silence made him sway. Mina did not object. They ate, an act that always felt a little intimate now in a city where food had turned into a calculation: where had it come from, who grew it, who did not get to eat because you did. The croissants flaked pleasantly, a simple pleasure imported diagonally.\n\n\u201cWhen did they start calling it the Ministry of Harmony?\u201d Mina asked.\n\n\u201cWhen the Ministry of Decorum got renamed,\u201d Evan said. \u201cWhen the Ministry of Order ate the Department of Compliance. When the Department of Records got folded into\u2014you know what, never mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father would tell you not to stop the sentence halfway.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father would tell me to burn the sentence,\u201d Evan said. He opened the drawer in full.\n\nThe letters lay in their sleeps, bound with a string that had long since cut into them like a scar. Twenty-seven. White, cream, and one pale blue. He had counted them so many times he knew their thickness by weight. He had not read them all. He had read one. One had read him. He could not\u2014there was a phrase his father used to use, pedagogical and patient\u2014he could not yet afford the other knowledge. There it was: the voice he had avoided choking on all morning. The voice of a father who was dead and not quiet about it.\n\nMina did not reach. She put the tips of her fingers on the table and touched the wood, touching the letters by proximity. She had offered, weeks ago, to take them for him, to put them somewhere safe, as if such a place still existed. He had nearly said yes. He had said no. He had made them both complicit.\n\n\u201cDoes June know?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat they\u2019re here?\u201d\n\n\u201cJune knows not to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cJune knows to bring a warrant.\u201d\n\n\u201cJune would never bring a warrant.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a detective,\u201d he said. \u201cThey taught her that the state is a river. If she is a fish she swims.\u201d\n\nMina said nothing. It was not kind, what he had said, and she was leaving it with him so he could see it.\n\nHe took the letter at the top of the bundle and slid it free. Its envelope had never been sealed; it had the absence of glue you see sometimes in old stock or in items made for practice. The paper inside was thin, almost onion, the kind the government liked in the twentieth century before the climate corners were cut. His father's hand was not on it. His father's hand was never on it. The script was precise and lazy at once, a hand that knew it would be read by eyes that loved it.\n\nHe did not read. He let his eyes move, a child's trick for avoiding the text while stealing its shape. He saw the name. It said Dear Evan in a way that suggested he was younger. It said Dear Ev. One letter had said Dear E. Once, in a way that had made him sit down suddenly, Dear Creature.\n\nMina watched his face like you watch a weatherperson\u2019s face when the radar is going red-red-red. She had always tried to be a reader of faces; she had told a story once at dinner about the first time she knew her mother had lied to her, a story involving a rabbit and a scarf and an empty pantry. He placed the letter on the table and put his index finger on the final paragraph. It was not an index. It was his finger. He had been thinking in catalogue terms, in finding aids and box lists. Old habits like barnacles.\n\n\u201cThis one,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the one with the description.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf the drawer. Of the city. Of today.\u201d He said it like a joke, but the air buckled around the words.\n\n\u201cYou told me there was a letter like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI sort of didn\u2019t believe you, if I am being honest. Are you reading it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a drunk,\u201d he said, immediately ashamed. He\u2019s not a drunk, she had said once to their aunt, when their aunt had fretted that he had called her three nights in a row and said nothing. She had said it with a graze of humor so soft it could almost be love.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re not,\u201d she said, as if she were saying it again to the aunt. \u201cI just want to be here. I just want to be a person you can tell, later, that I was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think something is going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf course I do.\u201d\n\nHe read. He read with the peculiar greed he had when the letters aligned with the day, a floating greed, a greed with clean hands. He read the first sentence twice and then three times and then out loud, because reading out loud changed it, it made the words heavier and made it impossible for the mind to slip its leash and run off like a dog after an imaginary rabbit.\n\nThe letter said:\n\nToday, at nine thirty-one, you will hear your name spoken on the radio and not spoken, and you will turn the radio off, and you will open the drawer.\n\nHe did not say, Mina. He did not say Look. He was not going to perform. He read on.\n\nYou will read this sentence. You will like the line about the radio. You will think it is clever. It is not clever. It is a wire. It is a fence post. It is a way of saying: you will do the things you have already done. You will be tired. The city will be gray. Outside, the motorcade is moving. You are already in the hard part. You will want someone to tell you that it is not the hard part. I am not going to be that person.\n\nI'm sorry for the handwriting, the letter said in the next line, and it looked like a joke because the handwriting was immaculate, but it was not a joke. The apology was for the apology.\n\nHe skipped. He made himself go back. The letter had rules like that. If you skipped, you lost the shape. You lost the thread.\n\nThe letter said:\n\nThe Ministry of Harmony will visit you. They will be polite and they will ask you if you have seen a thing that contains something. They will not say the words drawer or letter. They will hold their hands flat like plates. They will bring fruit. You will think of this as a joke and you will tell Mina. You will tell her the fruit is a sign. It is not a sign. It is fruit.\n\n\u201cIs this the one that tells you\u2014\u201d Mina began, and then stopped, because she did not want to be in the sentence, in the wire.\n\nHe did not answer. He reached the part he always reached in these letters, the kink where prophecy turned into architecture. He could feel it before he saw it in ink. The way the ink changed, just a little heavier as if the pen had been dipped again. He read the paragraph that made his heart speed and his jaw hurt.\n\nIt said:\n\nThere is going to be a way to stop them. Humans love a way like an animal loves a bone. You think the way is a lever. You think you pull and the wall falls and there is light, hallelujah. It is not like that. The way is a drawer. The way is a place you should not open, a box you kept because your father told you to keep it, because once he told you to burn a letter and you did not, you couldn't, because the fire on that particular night looked too theatrical and you have always hated theater. The way is made of things people wrote with their hands. The way is old love, and accounts, and receipts, and the very boring notice your mother kept from a laundry about how the washing machines would be out of service from the twelfth to the fourteenth. The way is this letter. I am not trying to be mystical. It is mechanics. It is gears. I can explain later. Later is complicated.\n\nHe put his hand over the paragraph and felt his face become the face of a person hiding in a movie. Mina had learned to be quiet when he pressed his palm to ink like that. She stood up without sound. She brought him water. She put it within reach so he did not have to move through the space between his chair and the glass.\n\nHe read the rest. He did not intend to read the rest\u2014they say good intentions don't matter, but they do; they matter because you measure how far you are from them, you measure the gap and you call the gap guilt\u2014but he read. The letter described a sequence of foldings, exactly three, not one more. It said that if he folded one letter in thirds\u2014not this one, the one with the pale blue paper\u2014and slid it along the tongue of the drawer, he would hear a click like a bead. It said that if he tore the red stamp from the envelope with the missing glue and chewed it (Don't swallow, the letter said, as if writing to a child, as if it knew he would laugh and gag simultaneously) he would say a name in his head and someone would answer. It said that if he did both, and then read the name of the person who wrote the very last letter, the one at the bottom, out loud into the drawer, there would be a light that was not light and then he would understand how destroy is not a violent verb but an emptiness verb, a word meaning to un-make space.\n\nHe stopped. He closed his eyes. His mouth was dry, his tongue a stick.\n\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to faint,\u201d Mina said. \u201cYou don\u2019t faint, do you? Tell me you\u2019re not a fainter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. He heard the word as if spoken by someone else. A poor actor. A man in a play wearing a tie all wrong.\n\n\u201cThat's a lot of face paleness for 'fine,'\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me to call June?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He did want June. He wanted her steadiness and her early-cop habit of writing everything down in a notebook, even now when the city had networked her to the point where notebooks were considered anachronistic and suspicious. He wanted exactly the sound of her pen scratching when he said something unbelievable. He wanted her to say, Okay, and then to say, Start again.\n\nThe buzzer buzzed. It was anticlimax and catastrophe at once. The sound was neither polite nor rude. It had been the same buzzer since the building was erected, a decade when people still believed in good materials. Mina went to the intercom and did not press talk. She flattened her hand on the wall above it. She did not need to ask him who it would be. This, too, was in the letter. He did not need to ask if he should answer. They had already done it in one version of the day. They were doing it again. They were trapped in the etiquette of time.\n\nHe pressed talk. The voice came up from the vestibule with a small city of static built around it.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Mr. Saye,\u201d it said. \u201cWe see that you are listening to the news. We hear the music. Please open the door.\u201d\n\nEvan had a habit, the habit of normal people: when confronted with the abnormal, imitate calm. He pressed the door and buzzed them in. He stood in the kitchen. He wondered if he was supposed to hide the letters. He did not move toward them, as if motion itself would draw a line from the drawer to his hand. Mina stood in the doorway like a guard in a Renaissance painting. Automatically, she smoothed her scarf.\n\nThey arrived not like police, who bang and bang again, but like polite relatives. Two women, both wearing clothing meant to be interpreted as neutral, the way clouds are meant to be interpreted as neutral even when the storm is inside them. One had dark hair in a coil at the nape. She carried a metal case. The other wore glasses without lenses. Her suit had been cut for someone else\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cWe are Harmony,\u201d the woman with the glasses said, proving the letter. \u201cLuwena Creel, Minister, and this is Kass. May we enter?\u201d\n\nEvan said yes because no had stopped being part of the vocabulary. He looked at their hands. Kass, the one with the case, had a small scar across her knuckles. He realized he was always looking at hands now. He remembered his father's, moving when he spoke even when they were empty, spelling invisible words in the air.\n\nMina fetched two chairs and set them opposite the table. She did not introduce herself. She pulled the scarf tighter and looked like a student who had not done the reading and was going to be so careful she would become part of the wallpaper. Creel smiled at her and set the smile down as if it had weight.\n\n\u201cMr. Saye,\u201d Creel said. \u201cWe have been following your work.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and everyone,\u201d Mina murmured.\n\n\u201cOur work is to follow,\u201d Creel replied as if she had been allowed to hear the words, as if this were a play with careful staging. Her eyes were hazel and had a black rim like a ring of coal. \u201cYour father also was a man whose work we followed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sent a wreath,\u201d Evan said. It came out like an accusation. \u201cIt had\u2014figs.\u201d\n\n\u201cFigs are a symbol of fraternity,\u201d Creel said smoothly. \u201cThe Greeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe apes,\u201d Mina said very softly. She was not supposed to say it; the words were being gently discouraged now as if they were slurs. Creel pretended she had not heard, and by pretending, made the word tremble like the tight line of a highwire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to ask some questions,\u201d Kass said, her first words in a voice that had gravel in it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to ask about boxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoxes?\u201d Evan said. He put his hand on the table as if he were going to stand and then realized he was already standing. He sat. He did not touch the drawer. He thought of the drawer as a mouth.\n\n\u201cBoxes,\u201d Creel repeated. \u201cContainers. We have a list of items survived from the pre-Integration period that are categorized as heuristics. Assemblies. Your father oversaw some of them. We need to take an inventory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here to take my father\u2019s things,\u201d he said. They were not his father\u2019s things. They had been his father\u2019s for a while and then his father\u2019s hands had stopped moving and the things had become the things of the state again, the state that was a river, the river that had new fish.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to recognize them,\u201d Creel said. \u201cThe word is recognize.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d Mina blurted, and actually stood up as if she might go and get them water. Creel\u2019s smile changed a fraction. The fraction contained the word Good.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Creel said. \u201cIf we may ask: you received a letter last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Evan said, because if the letter knew this, they would know too. \u201cA form letter about the volunteer registry. I discarded it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI receive a lot of mail,\u201d he lied, badly.\n\n\u201cThe other letter,\u201d she said again, and this time she turned her head, and he saw the light catch the lenses that weren't there. It hurt his eyes. He looked at Kass and saw what Kass was looking at: the corner of the envelope lying innocently under the string, the pale blue one. There was no way she could have seen it; he had not moved anything, the drawer was barely open. He felt a heat of unreasonable anger. He wanted to slap the drawer and shout at it as if it were a dog that had done something wrong. It had not. He had. He had opened it while the city was full of motorcades and speeches. He had let the smell out.\n\n\u201cThe volunteer registry letter,\u201d Mina cut in, with a reporter\u2019s skill for re-suturing a conversation. \u201cHe got it. Everyone on this block got it. It\u2019s not special. Do you want me to show you mine?\u201d\n\nCreel did not look at her. \u201cMr. Saye,\u201d she said, \u201cyou understand that we ask for these things not to take them away, but to keep them safe for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you told my father,\u201d he said, and he had not intended to say it but there it was, the sentence on the table between them like a knife. \u201cAnd then you took him somewhere and he didn\u2019t come home for four days. And when he came home he said it was fine. And then he wrote me that letter six months before he died, telling me to keep the drawer closed\u2014\u201d He cut himself. It was too much, and he had said the thing he was not supposed to say. He had said the drawer out loud.\n\nMina made a small animal sound. Kass\u2019s eyes shifted; you could almost hear the lens aperture moving. Creel did not change expression. Only her hands changed, the fingers of both hands coming together as if in prayer, not touching, just hovering in the shape of a prayer. She had good hands for television.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to ask you,\u201d Creel said calmly, \u201cto come with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have a warrant?\u201d Mina asked before Evan could say anything at all, good or bad. It was a question that had to be asked like a ritual in a religion where God has stopped answering and the ritual is how you keep your humaneness.\n\n\u201cWe have a note,\u201d Creel said. She derived the words from their smallest parts. \u201cA white note. A note that is white.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you speak like this because you think he is stupid?\u201d Mina asked. Her voice shaking now, the scarf too tight.\n\n\u201cI speak like this because we have been instructed,\u201d Creel said. She put the note on the table. It was actual paper, a novelty now. It had a stamp with a bird that no longer existed. The stamp might have been a taunt. The note had no letterhead. The letters on it were letters like they had taught third-graders to make in a lost decade. He could not help reading it.\n\nIt said:\n\nWhen you receive this, it will be time. Please bring the man in question. Please bring his letters in their case. Do not open them. Do not let him open them. Say the word cradle if anyone asks you about warrants. If anyone says drawer, smile. This is delicate. The name is Eider.\n\nThe name bit him. He did not make a sound, but he felt the bite. The word Eider had appeared once before, in a letter that had made him cold in August. He had thought, because he was human, of a duck, of down, of the softest wing. He had later looked up the etymology and laughed at himself. He had read that it also meant something else in another tongue, something that was not actually a translation so much as an invitation. He had closed the book.\n\nEvan looked up and saw that Creel had understood. That had been the point of saying the name out loud: to make him look up. He would have looked up anyway.\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina said. \u201cThis is insane. You know where this leads.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt leads to a room,\u201d Kass said, her voice unexpectedly gentle. \u201cA room with a table and chairs. Air conditioning. There is nothing in the room. We will speak. Later, there will be coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make it sound so nice,\u201d Mina said, tears in her voice now, and Evan hated himself for liking her anger, for finding it reassuring. Her anger meant the world was still wired.\n\nHe stood. He reached for his jacket. He did not look at the drawer one last time because that would have made him the man in a movie with the wrong tie. He did not look at Mina because if he saw her face he might sit down and become the man who does not leave and then the letter would be wrong and he did not know what would happen then. He did not believe the letter was right because he was not a child. He believed in something messier: the way the world rolls downhill.\n\nAt the door, Creel touched his arm. Her hand was cool, dry. Her palm had a ridge of callus like a guitar player\u2019s. He filed this away. Suddenly, he remembered something his father had said when Evan was fourteen and the world was full of teachers who did not matter to him in the least. His father had said, Watch how people hold small things. It will tell you what they will do with large things. At the time it had seemed foppish, like advice about cravats. He thought about the callus. He thought about the way she had placed the note on the table, the gentleness of it. He thought about fruit.\n\nThe elevator had a mirror, and it gave him back a face he did not like. He had grown a beard because he had not shaved on a morning when it mattered, and then it became easier to keep not shaving. He had become the sort of man who looked like he had thoughts in an attic. He had become the sort of man whose opinions about tea mattered to him more than the news. He leaned his head against the cool mirror and closed his eyes. He remembered a photograph from an exhibit of early apes: a silverback in a suit, sitting on a stool with a banana balanced on the palm of his hand like a joke, like a crown.\n\nThey took him in the polite car. The city went by like a film about the city, the way you see your street and see it as if it had been made for a movie. He noticed banners he had not noticed. The banners were a kind of grammar, small declaratives: WE SHARE. WE ARE HERE. WE ARE ORDER. Slogans like the old ones, but with the pronouns shifted one seat left. He saw June at a crosswalk in her black coat with the ripped lining and an umbrella that refused to open all the way. She did not see him. He almost banged on the window. He almost did a dozen things that he did not do.\n\nThe building they took him to had not been its building before. It had been a bank, then a data center, then a school, then nothing, and now it was this, a place where rooms had been redefined. The city had better metaphors but had lost the habit of using them. Aren\u2019t we clever, we used to say when we made a church a restaurant, a warehouse a loft. Now we said nothing. We were shells in shells.\n\nThey put him in a room that had nothing in it, exactly as advertised. A table. Chairs. An air conditioner that hummed like the radio. He sat and thought about saying, Cradle, and laughed a little because the word was ridiculous in his mouth. Creel and Kass made a show of leaving him alone. He did not think the room had ears. He thought the room was a mouth.\n\nHe waited. He had planned to be brave. He had planned to be polite and then not-polite and then brave. He had planned to say, I want my lawyer, and then he remembered he did not have a lawyer, not the way one has a lawyer in movies. He thought of the letter: a sequence of folds, a tear, a name. He thought of the tiny ritual that would unmake a lump of time into something else. He thought of the way the word destroy had felt in his mouth when he had said it once in therapy, in an office where a woman with a sharp bob had given him permission to think about the worst. He thought of the word as a tool, as a spoon. He kept thinking of spoons for weeks afterward. He saw them everywhere. He did not tell anyone because he did not want to know if it meant anything.\n\nThey brought him coffee. The coffee tasted like coffee. It was too hot. Kass sat, and Creel did not sit. She leaned against the wall and folded her arms and then unfolded them. She looked like a person doing a good impression of a friend.\n\n\u201cWe're not your enemies,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause then I would have too many.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re very literary. June says the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cJune knows you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all here. The river.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here for the drawer,\u201d he said. He couldn't stop himself from saying it. The word had a fanged sweetness now, a dessert that made his mouth bleed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for you,\u201d Creel said smoothly.\n\n\u201cWhich is the same thing.\u201d\n\nKass put the cup on the table in such a careful way that he wanted to take it and throw it. \u201cWe think your father was involved in a program you have not been briefed on,\u201d she began. \u201cWe think it involved the management of legacy texts.\u201d\n\n\u201cLegacy texts,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou mean letters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe mean letters,\u201d she conceded.\n\n\u201cAnd why? Why do you care about a drawer of paper that old ladies in libraries would not catalog because the acid content is wrecking them? Why do you care about letters that smell like snow? Why do you want something that can\u2019t be digitized?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause there was a program,\u201d Creel said. \u201cBecause words were a technology. Because your father believed in lever-points. Because we were late to that belief, and we are not late anymore. Because, Mr. Saye, you know this already or you would not have opened the drawer when the motorcade passed. You know you are not a victim. You know you are one of the authors.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. It had no humor in it. \u201cYou have been reading my mail.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been reading the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes your mail is in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me what it does,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t lie. Tell me what it does.\u201d\n\nCreel looked to Kass, and there was a flicker there that made him glad he had asked. He had been right. There were tears underneath her professionalism. There was something like respect under Kass\u2019s gravel.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d Kass said. \u201cWe have theories.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always have theories,\u201d Creel added, half a joke, making Kass sound like the voice of caution she probably was. \u201cWe know it is a bundle. We know the letters are tuned. We know certain words make certain doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoors where?\u201d he asked, and he felt like a child at a menagerie asking for a tiger. \u201cWhere do they lead?\u201d\n\n\u201cDown,\u201d Creel said. She used the word with no emphasis and so it carried all the emphasis in the world.\n\n\u201cThe old trick,\u201d he said. \u201cWe go down to go up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe correct the error,\u201d she said. It was not clear whose error, when it had been made. \u201cIt is a safe program when done correctly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if done incorrectly?\u201d He had to keep asking the obvious questions. It made him feel like himself.\n\nKass touched her scar absently. \u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cYour father asked for you. He asked that if we could not contain the drawer\u2014we hate that word\u2014if we could not contain the letters, we should bring you in and tell you half of the story and see if the other half would show itself. He said you were the only one who could read the handwriting that is not on the page.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's a very sweet line that you have prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cDid he dictate that one? Or did you write it?\u201d\n\nKass smiled. \u201cHalf that line is mine,\u201d she said. \u201cI like it.\u201d\n\nHe sat with his hands on his knees and thought about not saying anything at all, because not saying anything at all had become a sort of theology for him. He had a religion of silence now, a religion that did not help anyone and did not change the world and did not move the brutes of history one inch. He was aware of the brutes, the way they move slow, the way we hang banners on them as if that would make their feet lighter. He was aware of his own smallness, a person in a room with coffee and a letter in his pocket, pretending that one action of his could move anything larger than a kettle to boil.\n\nHe said, \u201cWho is Eider?\u201d\n\nKass and Creel both stilled. It was such a petty thing, the stillness. The room became a photograph. He watched them become sculpture, and then watched them become people again, and it made him feel like he had turned the world off and on.\n\nCreel lowered her eyes. \u201cYour father\u2019s colleague,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I?\u201d\n\n\u201cEider was a name assigned to the program. People took it as their sobriquet. It meant\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA duck,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t add anything else. He liked having the last word for once even if it was stupid.\n\n\u201cWe have followed a map,\u201d Creel went on, a little flustered now, and the tiny mess she made of the sentence brought him a strange relief. \u201cWe have our program. We need your cooperation. We need you to bring the letters out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d she said, speaking cleanly again. \u201cWe do not force you. We are asking.\u201d\n\nHe understood something then that felt like a knot loosening and then tightening again. He could say no, and they would not force him today. They would only ask again tomorrow. They would be polite until politeness wore him away like a river. He suddenly wanted to be unpolite on purpose, to become something it would hurt them to tame. He did not know how to be that person.\n\n\u201cI will bring you one,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the good one. A letter that is not a key. A letter that will teach you nothing.\u201d He said this defiantly, and then felt the ridiculousness of the defiance. Eyebrows raised in pity.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kass said evenly. \u201cWe will learn what we can from the wrong letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Mina had slipped into the room without his hearing the door. He looked at her, surprised, and she looked back with a face he had never seen on her. She had borrowed someone else's expression, a woman from a painting, a woman who had had to live through something worse than jokes on television. \u201cWhy are you helping them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not helping them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou are bringing them the thing they do not know how to name.\u201d\n\nHe folded his hands into their negative. He wanted to tell her that there were worse fates than helping, and one of them was letting someone else do it. He did not say it. He said nothing, because he is so good at that.\n\nOn the way home, the motorcade had changed its smell. It smelled like oil alone now, the bananas gone. It felt like an omen, and because it felt like an omen he refused to name it. He went up the stairs and not in the elevator. He counted the steps, childish, and lost count twice and started again. In the kitchen, he washed his hands.\n\nHe took out the pale blue letter. He folded it in thirds. He slid it along the tongue of the drawer. He did not chew the stamp, because it made him laugh to think of it and he could not bear laughter in the room with the letters. He put the blue folded thing in place and heard, yes, a click like a bead struck with a fingernail.\n\nHe waited then, because you wait when you have heard a click even if you think it means nothing. He closed the drawer. He opened it again because that is a reflex. Nothing had changed. The envelopes lay like creatures pretending not to be creatures. The bottom-most one had its corner frayed in that way that made him think it had rubbed against a pocket of a coat in a place where a life had been lived that was not his. He did not reach for it. He had told Creel that he would bring them the wrong letter and he planned to keep his wrong promise.\n\nThe next morning, he would take the second letter from the top, the one his father had once called \u201cthe bread letter\u201d in a moment of joking that had not been his style. He would wrap it in brown paper and tuck it into an envelope from the Department of Records with a sticky note that said nothing useful. He would walk it across the city in a canvas bag like any other literate person with errands. He would hand it over and they would smile at him as if he had carried someone\u2019s baby and he would hate them for being polite and new.\n\nThat would be tomorrow. Tonight was long and was going to be longer.\n\nMina made soup and burned it and they ate it anyway. June came late, with her notebook, and took off her shoes at the door and put her socks flat on the wood like someone touching a lake with cautious toes. June looked at the letters and did not look. She put the notebook on the table with the tenderness of someone putting a sleeping cat down. She was a thick-boned woman with a straight mouth. She had the gift of making people feel less ridiculous in their own heads.\n\n\u201cYou are in something,\u201d she said to Evan after they had watched the part of the speech where the Primarch spoke about love. \u201cYou know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou will call me when your name is spoken again. You will call me before you leave with anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did call you,\u201d he said, aware of the childishness of pointing out that Mina had. \u201cIn my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's not how telephones work,\u201d she said, and wrote something in her notebook. He craned, feeling ungallant, and saw that she had drawn a spoon.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with me?\u201d he asked, some time later, when they had all become quieter. \u201cWhy do I feel like this is a family event? Why do I feel like a holiday is coming and I am going to ruin it by saying something true?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is wrong yet,\u201d June said. \u201cWait for wrong. It will come. It always comes on time. It has a watch that works.\u201d\n\nHe thought of clocks. He thought of the one on the wall that had stopped at 2:17 on the day the building lost power and never restarted in a way that mattered. He thought of his father\u2019s watch, which had ticked loudly in the hospital room the last hour and then had not ticked anymore and then had ticked again when the nurse shook it absentmindedly, and how he had wanted to slap the nurse not for shaking it but for restoring time after his father had left it. He thought of the drawer and the word destroy that waited like a dog in a kennel in his throat.\n\nHe thought of Eider.\n\nAt two in the morning, when the city had switched to the people who believe in two in the morning\u2014the bakers, the drunks, the watchers at every kind of window\u2014he went to the desk and opened the bottom letter. He had told himself he would not, but also the letter had told him he would. So who was in charge of whom? He read. The letter was short, a postcard pretending to be a letter, a scrap pretended into importance. It said:\n\nHello, love. Time is syrup. It is going to be a thick morning. There is a lever disguised as a drawer. There is a song disguised as a letter. If you sing it, things will go away. We only make space when we cannot make peace. Do not forgive me when it happens. That will be our sin together.\n\nThe signature was not a signature. It was a drawing of a bird with its wings folded as if sleeping.\n\nHe pressed the paper to his face and smelled it and it smelled like oranges and noise and the hospital room with his father gone and the radiator tick, tick, tick. He had the sense of being on a staircase with a door he could open and not open both. He had the sense of a thing that had already happened and the way you feel about it is what changes when you change. He wanted to be, absurdly, a better person.\n\nHe put the letter away. He closed the drawer. It rattled in a way he had begun to dream. He lay on the couch and closed his eyes and made a bargain with a God he did not believe in and a primate he did not trust and a future he did not want. He promised nothing. That felt like a relief. He slept a shallow sleep with pockets in it.\n\nIn the morning, the city had a new banner. It said WE WILL KNOW EACH OTHER. Children were drawing it on the sidewalks in dust. They had been told what to write and they had been given the chalk as a kindness. A boy with a cowlick asked Evan if letters could be dangerous and Evan said no because he was not prepared to be the kind of man who tells a child the truth. The boy said, My mother says apes eat letters, and Evan laughed despite himself and then stopped and said that no, they do not, that was a silly thing to say, and the boy said, She says it about the mail, not the animals. He walked away then, relieved to be stupid in the presence of a child.\n\nHe walked to the Ministry with the letter that was the wrong one wrapped like bread. The building breathed around him, like a big lung. The lobby had a mural of the river with fish. He handed the letter to Kass, who took it with hands that were careful and a scar that was real. Creel watched with her mind\u2019s lens.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Kass said, and he believed she meant it. \u201cWe can say the word we were told to say. We can say cradle.\u201d\n\n\u201cCradle,\u201d he repeated, and the word did something to the air, like a small hole you can see through to a better room, not because the room is better but because your mind makes it so. He was a sucker for holes.\n\n\u201cWould you like to see him?\u201d Creel asked as if asking if he would like more coffee that he couldn\u2019t drink.\n\n\u201cSee who?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Primarch,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked for you.\u201d\n\nHe felt an absurd ripple of pride and then it died on the beach of his actual self. \u201cI have errands,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a life. I have to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to go home and open the drawer,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me to say it?\u201d\n\nHe did something then that he had not planned to do. He let them take him. He walked into a room with a glass wall and a view of the dome and the river and the banners and the heat and the birds that were not there. The Primarch sat with his back to the glass. He was smaller than he was on television, and more precise, like a sculpture you had seen in pictures and had not realized the artist had carved the hand veins. He turned and looked at Evan with a curiosity that made a liar of Evan\u2019s enmity.\n\n\u201cMr. Saye,\u201d he said. \u201cWe share a love of drawers.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould I laugh?\u201d Evan asked. He was asking himself.\n\nThale made a shape with his mouth that was not human. \u201cDo you know the story,\u201d he said, \u201cof the woman who kept all the winds in a bag?\u201d\n\n\u201cPandora,\u201d Evan said automatically, and then shook his head. \u201cNo. Someone else. A lesser-known myth with no box and no hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames shift,\u201d Thale said. \u201cWe have been carried in your bags and your boxes. We appreciate containers. We are respectful of edges. We do not step over lines unless invited.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are inviting yourselves,\u201d Evan said.\n\nThale inclined his great head. He had a scar on his jaw, white with oldness. \u201cYour father understood something about edges,\u201d he said. \u201cHe understood that the only way to leave a circle is to draw a larger one and step into it. We thought he was our friend, Mr. Saye. Perhaps he was. We need a friend now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not your friend,\u201d Evan said, but it sounded like someone else\u2019s line, because of course he was not, but of course he was standing in a room with him, of course he had brought the wrong letter like a supplicant with the wrong coin for the ferry. \u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\nThale\u2019s hand moved, huge and delicate, as if he were going to pluck a fruit from an invisible bowl. \u201cBecause you keep things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a keeper. You do not burn. We have burned so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have burned some,\u201d Evan said. \u201cNot enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will help you,\u201d Thale said, and the way he said it made it sound like an act of mercy and not a threat. \u201cWe will make the edges neat.\u201d\n\nEvan wanted, desperately, a small old-fashioned dissatisfaction, some petty thing to object to: you cut your suit wrong, your tie is too bright, the coffee is too hot. He had no such reliefs. He was in the center of something large and he was not going to get any of the pleasures of smallness. He was going to be used, perhaps even by himself.\n\nHe went home. He opened the drawer. He placed the letters in the order the letter had described without looking like he was doing it. He chewed the stamp and spit it into the tissue he had prepared in case it mattered. He wiped his mouth and felt ridiculous. He said the name Eider quietly, and when nothing happened he said it louder and then louder until he heard the apartment change shape. The radiator ticked in a new meter. The kettle made a sea sound. The drawer became empty and then not empty in a way that the eye cannot be trusted to describe.\n\nSomething woke. Or the word is unfroze. Or the word is corrected. The room did a small bow. He felt a hand on his shoulder that was not a hand. He felt an apology in his bones. He felt the world unbutton one button and then a second.\n\nMina knocked and opened and stood with a bag of fruit in the doorway and said, \u201cNo,\u201d once, an almost-laugh, the sound you make when you see a wave and you are already ankle-deep, you can\u2019t stop it now. June came behind her, late again, with her notebook, and the Primarch\u2019s motorcade honked three times somewhere across the river, the low honk of patience.\n\nEvan looked at the letters and knew, in a factual way, that they were a machine, a small dirty machine with love stains on it, a machine that did not belong in the world because it would take the world away from itself, cleanly, the way a magician removes the birthday coin from behind your ear and shows you the empty hand. He knew. He did not tell them. He asked if anyone wanted tea. He put the kettle on to boil. He leaned against the counter and thought of his father\u2019s last laugh.\n\nHe would press his hands on the drawer and say the next word when it was time. He was going to fail to save anyone. He would do it anyway, like a man who tips his hat to an empty church.\n\nHe looked out the window and saw a banner catch on a streetlight and tear itself in two. He watched it fall, both halves trying to be a whole. He thought, We will know each other.\n\nHe thought, I will destroy you. He thought, I will destroy us. He thought, I will open the drawer.\n\nThe drawer rattled, once, rude. A cough from a sick child in a library. He wanted to shush it. He wanted to say, Hush, we\u2019re all reading. He wanted to say, We\u2019re all here. We\u2019re present. It\u2019s time.The kettle sang itself toward a boil and then, strangely, away from it, as if the sound had been placed on a shelf and someone with long fingers had moved it a few inches to the left. Mina stood with the fruit bag half-open, the citrus shining like moons of a small, friendly planet, and June leaned against the doorframe as if the building leaned on her in turn. None of them spoke because there was a new sound in the apartment, thin and fine as a hair in the throat. For a heartbeat Evan thought it was in the radiator again, that old, domestic telegraph. Then he understood it was the drawer.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that it rattled. It held still with a posture that suggested some absence was doing the moving for it. If a cupboard can think, the drawer seemed to be considering a new idea. He had never believed wood could be intent, but intention was in the grain now, a fine attention drawn along by the weight of words. He told himself to stop being ridiculous and then felt the patience of the ridiculous gather itself in the corners, like dust that had learned to wait for a particular boot.\n\nHe went to it because he had to go to it; there was no choreography where he did not. He laid his palms on the old wood and felt a temperature that wasn\u2019t warm and wasn\u2019t cool, a body temperature borrowed from no body. If he had been the version of himself who still wore ties and corrected undergraduates on the distinction between primary and secondary sources, he would have described the sensation as archival. It had the quiet of stack basements, the muffled hum of the regulator fan, the sense that one wrong breath would dislodge a century.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything yet,\u201d June said, and he loved her for assuming that he could do anything and for postponing it with a phrase like the one nurses use before they slide a needle in. \u201cJust tell me what you feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike we\u2019ve been asked a question,\u201d he said without thinking. \u201cAnd like the person who asked it is in the next room and has decided to let us sweat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very specific,\u201d Mina said, but her voice had gotten small, the way posture gets small when someone in the train car raises their voice and everything vibrates along.\n\nThe letter with the bird-wings signature lay where he had put it, barely in view, a corner like a tooth. He had not said the third thing aloud and would not until the word in his mouth stopped feeling like a treachery. The instruction in the letter had been so precise that it made the rest of his life look like smudged chalk. The clarity frightened him more than the content. He had grown used to a certain muddle. A bright line is a cruel thing.\n\nThe kettle committed to the boil. He flicked it off, and the room, deprived, made a small complaining noise: the air adjusting itself, the pipes remembering they are pipes. He poured. He moved his hand at the speed of someone taking shortened steps to avoid the attention of a predator. Mina made the tea weak because she was afraid of getting anything wrong. June took hers without asking for sugar, which was the same as asking for nothing.\n\n\u201cEvan,\u201d Mina said, and stopped there, his name holding his face like a hand. \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said truthfully. He did not add that he had a way of finding out. He did not say the thing about the third word and light that is not light. He was tired of being a man who held the plot and chewed it like a bad actor with a prop. He had never wanted to be the stage manager of a disaster.\n\nOutside, a siren passed that had learned a new tone in a new decade, a polite whoop that made you guilty for ignoring it. The morning was committing itself to brightness in a grudging way. He could just see the edge of the new banner from the kitchen window where a neighbor had trussed it, the slogan like a noun phrase on a page where someone forgot to put the verb back. Children\u2019s chalk had done what chalk does: it had dusted the air around the words with a tiny, cheerful mistake. The banner snagged on the bracket and a scrape-string caught in the wind and played a song that no one had asked it to play.\n\n\u201cWho did your father write to?\u201d June asked. Her voice was careful, the voice she used with kids in stairwells when she knew they had a knife and also knew they would not want to use it if asked not to in the right voice. \u201cThe person. The person who isn\u2019t you. The person who\u2019s in these like a shadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cA colleague,\u201d he said, automatically, because that was the word he had been given. It was the safe noun you use when fear makes you prefer the office to the bed. \u201cSomeone with a program name. Eider. Maybe Eider is a person and maybe it\u2019s a hat everyone wore when they wanted to walk unseen through important rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretend with me for a second that Eider is a person,\u201d June said. She didn\u2019t write as she spoke; she let the pencil rest on the paper in the same way surgeons rest their hands so they can make smaller movements in a minute. \u201cWhat did Eider want?\u201d\n\nThere was the childishness of saying, Me. He did not indulge himself. He thought instead of the feeling he had had when the letters lined up with what was happening outside the window, the little electricity that ran up his spine like a hand sleeking a cat backwards. He thought of the paragraph that had started with a joke\u2014This is not mystical\u2014and had refused to stay a joke.\n\n\u201cThey wanted someone to pull a rope they couldn\u2019t pull from where they were,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted a hand that can reach into a place a hand shouldn\u2019t. They wanted a good boy who doesn\u2019t burn to make up for the bad boy who burns too easily. They wanted my father to teach me how to like drawers more than matches.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Mina asked, and her smile made a small, bitter kindness of the word like. \u201cDo you like drawers more than matches?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a person who writes to archivists when I am angry and am comforted by the receipt of a polite acknowledgment three days later,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, yes.\u201d\n\nThe buzzer pressed its mouth hard into the wall and spoke. June and Mina both twitched in a synchronized recoil that would have amused him in the old days. He told himself not to push the talk button and pushed it anyway. When habit has been fed enough times, it is a dog in the kitchen at your heel; it will sit when you tell it to sit, but it will also sit when you do nothing at all, because sitting is its comfort.\n\n\u201cDelivery,\u201d the voice said, and he allowed himself the stupid hope that it would be some mistake, a parcel meant for a neighbor, a calendar subscription he had forgotten to cancel.\n\n\u201cFrom whom?\u201d June asked, leaning to the speaker without touching it, an old game of not leaving prints that felt like respect even now when prints had become quaint, like stamps.\n\n\u201cHarmony,\u201d the voice said, and paused as if they might know another Harmony and prefer it. \u201cFruit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fruit,\u201d Mina mouthed at him without sound, then shook her head like a person reading in a car, trying to shake the nausea off.\n\nThey let the man in. He was a man, a human man with a clean shirt and a polite haircut and a jaw that had known a barber recently but not this morning. He carried a carton with the logo of a company that had gone bankrupt and been bought and then had un-remembered its bankruptcy by changing the color of its font. He smiled. We had grown used to being the animals who smiled too much.\n\n\u201cMr. Saye?\u201d he asked, as if there might be two of them within and both might prefer not to claim the name.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Evan said. He moved to intercept the delivery before it could cross to the desk, before fruit could be set within touching distance of the drawer. He had the very dire superstition that round things would roll.\n\n\u201cCompliments of the Ministry,\u201d the man said. \u201cIn honor of the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat day?\u201d Mina said, her hand a clamp on the back of a chair.\n\n\u201cThe day,\u201d he said, as if that helped. He looked at June then, and his smile restructured itself for authority. \u201cWith our thanks,\u201d he added, and he was gone with an efficiency that left the shape of him behind the way a hot pan leaves a phantom circle on the counter.\n\nIt was a box of plums. The plums had that bloom on them, the pale astronomical mist that makes fruit look like it belongs in the sky. They were heavy. He felt suddenly the exact old weight of his father\u2019s hand in his hand, the way you memorize a person\u2019s mass unconsciously when you carry them to bed once.\n\n\u201cI hate that they always know what to bring,\u201d Mina said. \u201cIt\u2019s insulting that they\u2019re good at the mundane.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a language,\u201d June said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a language first.\u201d\n\nEvan took one plum and thought about dropping it into the drawer like a coin. He did not. He put them all on the counter and thought that if the world ends at least they would have eaten a perfect piece of fruit on the last morning. He washed three and they each ate one with the space between bites feeling ceremonial as silence between vows. The flesh was green-gold and the juice ran down his wrist in a way that made him feel adolescent and sad.\n\nThe apartment was all apartment again, and then the room tilted toward a person who was not in it. He felt the way a sound happens in bone before it happens in air. He wanted to put his hands over his ears and also to press his ear to the old wood like a child eavesdropping at a hotel door. He put his ear to the drawer. He was past humiliation. June didn\u2019t comment; she had taught humiliation to take a seat on her left like a partner at a dance.\n\nIt came not as a voice exactly, because when a voice comes out of a wooden thing in your apartment you move out or call a priest, and he could do neither. It came as an agreement in his spine. It was the sensation of nodding without moving your head.\n\nI am late, it said, and if you pinched him, if you asked him later in a court of reasonable men what exactly had been said, he would grind his teeth on the question and say: It told me it was late. But the words in his mind had a tailored width, a seam let out at the shoulder and taken in at the waist. They fit.\n\n\u201cYou hear it?\u201d he asked before he could stop himself from being a clich\u00e9.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina said immediately. Her eyes were the eyes of a person being asked to participate in a s\u00e9ance against her will. \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d June said, surprising them both. \u201cNot like a radio. Like a permission.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask permission for what. He wanted to be the kind of man who did not wait to be told which questions he was allowed. He chewed the inside of his cheek and tasted a metallic tang as if he had bitten tinfoil. He looked at June and then at Mina and then at his own hands, because he trusted his hands to tell him the truth more than his head now. They were not shaking. That was something.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d he asked the empty room. If there is a god of drawers, let it be someone\u2019s job to hold that title with dignity.\n\nThe answer was small and sufficient.\n\nRead.\n\nThe panic bloomed in him as if it had been waiting under his tongue for that word. He had been doing anything but. He had been a scientist standing next to a pond refusing to test the water. He had been a child counting steps and never looking up to see the door at the top. He was so tired of his own caution he could chew through it. He put his fingertips under the string, lifted the bundle as if it had lungs, and took out the third letter. He did not know why the third; the choice felt like his and not-his in the precise, confusing proportion that had become his daily patience.\n\nJune pulled a chair very quietly a half-inch closer to him and did not sit. Mina backed up a step and then returned it because she was someone who corrected her own cowardice with immediate, liberal applications of bravery. He did not say he was grateful because gratitude felt like a limited resource and he had become stingy.\n\nThe letter had been folded and refolded by someone who had cared and was not alive to care anymore in the same way. It had a crease like a healed cut. He slid it open.\n\nDear E., the letter said, and his body turned into a bridge with night trains rumbling across. Evan loved diminutives only when they were earned in bed or wrested on a playground. In ink they tended to feel like a trick, a way of making you small so you fit in the apparatus. His father had signed one, once, with a mere initial as if he had been wearing someone else\u2019s suit all day and had now stripped it down to the undershirt.\n\nYou will have the box by now, the letter said. You will have the look in your eyes that men get when they are asked to babysit a bomb and not tell anyone that the baby is not a baby. This is not, I swear to you, the project everyone pretends we were working on. That project is the stage set and it squeaks if you touch it and the paint is wet forever. This is smaller and ungovernable and shared. The good ones will want to ritualize it; the bad ones will want to own it. We have to do something else. We have to distribute the wrong thing in the right shape and the right thing in the wrong shape and hope the difference makes enough delay to allow something we don\u2019t have a name for to be born. I am calling it the cradle so I can say the word without spitting.\n\nHe felt June\u2019s gaze settle on the single word like a cup on a saucer. He did not look up. He had the feeling he had had as a boy when he had leaned too far over the balcony at the library and his father had put a hand flat on his back and pressed him forward a quarter-inch further, because some parents teach you not to fear edges by letting you see where the ground will not be and trusting you to be wise. He and his father had been idiots together; it\u2019s one of the ways we love.\n\nYou will be asked to let them help you, the letter said. You will be asked to describe the phrase \u201cspace unmaking,\u201d and someone with a scar on her hand will flinch when you do because she knows what that means in a place where memory is a hallway. You do not have to be brave in the way they like bravery, the way you step out and become an emblem they can hang from light poles. You have to be brave in the way I know you know, the family way, the way where you stay in the room a minute longer than any sane person would and you notice the thing no one else notices because they have eyes for spectacle and you have eyes for margins. The margins will flutter when the Drawer is awake. You will see it in the page count. You will see it in the lists. You will see it in the way a cataloger\u2019s pen hesitates over the word complete.\n\nHe made a sound he had not intended to make. It was the sound of recognition you hear when a dog sees its owner from across a park and cannot contain itself. He had been cataloging his whole life. He had made peace with making peace with boredom. And here his father had left him a religion in the very grammar of his days.\n\nWhat does it do, you are going to ask me with your mouth and also with your teeth, because I have kept your hands empty for too long, the letter said. It makes room. Don\u2019t look like that. You are making the face you make when you see a baby and forget three of the disasters you were remembering so vividly before you saw the baby, and you resent yourself for it later in the privacy of your bed. It makes room not in the soft sense but in the hard sense. It takes the bit of space that insists on its occupation and it unhooks one end of it and the rest follows, like a zipper. The thing that is unhooked does not fall anywhere. It is not like your belief in down. It is like the way a sentence stops being a sentence when I remove the verb. The subject feels insulted. The object feels unrumpled. Only later do you realize you have been standing in the absence of action.\n\nHe heard something like a sigh from the letters themselves. He told himself it was the apartment and felt, for a second, the old superstitions knock with their soft bones. He let them knock. He did not have to open to every caller. He could peek through and see that they had no weapon but the weapon of being old, and he could respect that, which is not nothing.\n\nThere is a trick, the letter said, for making sure you do not take the wrong bit of space, because you will want very much to take the bit where someone has placed their chair and is doing harm to someone in a chair. You must not. If you do that, everything gets small in the way children\u2019s furniture gets small and you will be the monkey at the tea party moving tiny cups around while the adults watch and clap, and that will be the end of us. You have to take what repeats. Your father would have told you this if we had had one more dinner, that thing he does with his hands when he is describing a pattern. Left, left, right, left, and then again with your eyes closed. What repeats is the wiring, not the wall. You do not remove walls. You remove routes.\n\nHe put the letter down and swallowed a burn that had come up his throat like a mild insult. He had no idea what that meant and also he knew, in the same way you know how to walk home in the dark if you have done it enough times. You follow the sounds. You follow the lights that are out and know why.\n\n\u201cRead it,\u201d June said when she saw him stop. It wasn\u2019t a command. It was like someone saying the name of a river you have to cross because the only bridge is two miles upstream. \u201cRead it all before you let yourself think you understood any of it.\u201d\n\nHe took a breath that felt like a page turning. He read.\n\nWe practice on small things, the letter said. We practice on a spoon. I am not being poetic. You think I am, because you are your father\u2019s son and you love the clean click of metaphor. No. Take a spoon that you have eaten from. Do not describe it. Do not give it a past. Touch the concavity with the pad of your finger. Say its name in the way that you would say your own if you were answering a roll call. Then ask the Drawer to make room for that curve. You will feel apple-pit spit in your mouth. That is how you will know it worked. The spoon will still be on the counter because space is not the same as object. This is what we keep failing to teach the Primarch\u2019s people. We keep explaining contracts to a nation of hands.\n\nHe looked down at the spoon June had drawn and then at the spoon on the counter, the one with the small hook-mark where it had fallen once into the disposal and survived the moment with only a souvenir. June made a face that said she was both sick of coincidences and resigned to them. Mina whispered, \u201cOf course,\u201d because she had the journalist\u2019s hunger for the tiny object that tells the whole story in a better voice than any human interviewee.\n\nNo, you do not get to ask the Drawer to take the door you don\u2019t like, the letter went on. No, you do not get to make room in a room where someone you love is trapped and you cannot get to them and the hallway has been made stupid on purpose. If you try, you will get the statutes wrong. If you try, you will remove the very thing you will later wish you had had when it is time to run, because that is what grief will do to your mouth. This is not a lesson. Lessons are for children. I am telling you how we survived one week longer than the modelers predicted. You will be angry when you understand this because I am giving you a limit and you do not like limits unless you are the one putting them on the table and calling them dinner.\n\nHe put the letter down again and let his body do the thing where you stand and then sit because you forgot that sitting is possible. Mina made a noise like a laugh that had been sent to its room for bad behavior and had returned chastened. June set her hand flat on the table, and he watched the way her thumb rested separate from the other fingers. His father\u2019s voice said, small things, in that irritated, loving tone that parents use when they are old enough not to be pretentious about what they care about.\n\n\u201cTry the spoon,\u201d Mina said, and her eyes told him she was saying this not because she believed but because believing or not believing should not matter. \u201cIf nothing happens we make more tea and we eat another plum and we all take a nap like soldiers in bad novels who have to fight in the afternoon.\u201d\n\nHe picked up the spoon. It was rougher than he had expected. The old habit of the sink had scuffed it into a private geography. He held it with the same careful disrespect with which he had once held the tail of a dead mouse he had had to carry to the trash because Mina had refused to touch it and June had refused to indulge him. He touched the concavity. He said, into the hard, bright air, \u201cSpoon,\u201d in the way you say your own name when you are at the doctor and you have an appointment at a particular time and you do not want to be called twice.\n\nThe drawer did not move. The room did a small, private adjustment the way rooms do when you shift the chair half an inch to the left. The shift was not in the spoon. The shift was in his mouth. He wanted to spit. He had not eaten an apple, but the bitter, dry, granular mark of the pit was under his tongue. It was instantly and intimately hateful.\n\nMina shrieked gently. June said, \u201cOkay,\u201d as if she had been given a new tool at work and was assessing how often it would break and whether there were screws small enough in the kit to fix it. Evan put the spoon down very carefully and then much too quickly as if it were a bee, and it clattered and the sound fell into the drawer as if the wood wanted it. He wiped his tongue on his teeth, performed the useless ceremony of disgust that civilization permits you, and laughed with his mouth closed because open laughs are for men at bars and boys in alleys and not for people losing their relationship to matter.\n\n\u201cDo you notice anything else?\u201d June asked after a moment in which they all tried to be ordinary people in a kitchen under a banner with an exhortation that would not feed anyone. \u201cThe margins.\u201d\n\nHe looked around the apartment like a tourist who keeps seeing something most is not looking at. He looked for the edges. The book on the counter was one he had left open to a chapter on landscape architecture before the Floods; it had a half-formed paragraph about terraces. The page number on the left said 184. The page number on the right did not say 185. It did not say anything. His heart did one large drum and then sat down to rest.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said, and put his finger on the page as if the empty could be underlined. \u201cI think that is what he meant about complete.\u201d\n\nHe saw, too, that the postcard on the refrigerator with his aunt\u2019s scrawl had lost the little drawing of the dog, as if the dog had walked off the paper while they were all sleeping. He saw that the list he had made with his father\u2019s watch-keeping insistence\u2014milk, foil, rice, soap\u2014was now three words long, but he had not used any of the items and he could remember writing all four. He would have loved, in another life, to discuss this with a patient woman with a bob in an office. He would have loved to describe the way loss takes the shape of utility before it takes the shape of grief.\n\n\u201cYou took the route,\u201d June said, looking at the empty page number like a small moon. \u201cHe\u2019s right. You didn\u2019t take the wall. You took the habit of getting from one to the other. You took the counting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate that I understand that instantly,\u201d Mina said, and put a hand to her mouth and pressed on it as if words were going to fall out and stain the floor. \u201cI hate that I can feel the trip of my eyes over the page expecting the number and that I have to step over the space like there\u2019s a dead thing there on the sidewalk and I am a person with good shoes who will not step in it.\u201d\n\nEvan sat. He wanted another plum and did not take one. He wanted to put the letters back in their string and hammer the drawer shut and call a carpenter to paint it shut as if paint were a law. He wanted his father alive just long enough to pat him on the shoulder and say, See, not to comfort him but to be infuriating in the way he had been infuriating, in the way that had made Evan who he was even if who he was had turned into a technology.\n\nThe phone vibrated. June, whose body had a private relationship to alarms, grabbed it the way a mother grabs a child about to run into the road. She read, and her face put on the expression it wore when she had to tell someone something they could not unknow without opening some small mercy\u2019s throat. She turned the screen toward him. It was a message from an unknown number formatted in the way official messages were formatted now so you could take a screenshot and show your friends that the official voice had sat down and written to you. The message said:\n\nMr. Saye. The Primarch will be making a private statement at noon. Your presence is requested at the Dome, east entrance. Your escort will arrive at 11:40. Please bring the item you have been instructed to bring. We will say the necessary word at the door.\n\nHe did not look up. He saw his father\u2019s handwriting in the typed words and knew that was impossible and also exactly necessary. He saw Kass\u2019s scar in the way the line breaks had been placed. He saw Creel\u2019s mind in the repetition of please. He heard the word cradle underlined and underlined again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going,\u201d Mina said, then corrected herself in the way of honest women. \u201cYou are going and I am angry at the inevitability of it, which is a stupid thing to be angry at. I am also going.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going,\u201d June said, not looking at either of them, making a small mark with her pencil on the paper as if she were marking the place where something would be found later when the floor was being taken up.\n\n\u201cI will not take it,\u201d he said. \u201cI will take it. I am a liar. I will take it because not taking it makes me a different liar. I will take it and not do what they want. I will take it and let it tell me what it is.\u201d\n\nMina put her forehead on the back of his head like a benediction. He let himself be benedicted. He wanted to keep his grandmother\u2019s diction of religion, all dim lamps and old paperbacks and a God who was a quiet cupboard, and he wanted to keep it even while he constructed a machine for unmaking space on his kitchen table with fruit and tea and a spoon that had lost a ghost number.\n\nHe put on his jacket. It had acquired an authority his shirts didn\u2019t have, as if the pockets kept a secret not his. He tucked the wrong letter\u2014a different wrong letter, he thought with a small, very poor joke that made him feel like a man whistling in a dark basement\u2014into the inner pocket where he had kept, as a young man, a condom in a case that made him feel like a person in a movie whose name starts with Mister. He took the bundle and wrapped it in paper the color of the old wall behind a painting, the clean square that tells you what the room used to be. He tied it with string and felt a ceremonial silliness and told himself to stop calling it silly. Nothing ceremonial is silly when the ceremony is the only way to ask the world to bend a fraction in your direction.\n\nThe escort was early by seven minutes like polite kidnappers. Kass was in the back, her scar visible now above the knuckle where it belonged. Creel had a scarf today, and it was not the one that would have told him anything. He had become a reader of scarves, a thing he would have mocked in any other life.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone who has not slept,\u201d Creel said, and made it tender in a way he would not forgive her for later. \u201cThank you for bringing what we asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that I have,\u201d he said, and then wished he had saved the line, because it felt good and he did not get enough lines lately that felt good to say.\n\n\u201cWe never know,\u201d Kass said. \u201cWe suspect.\u201d\n\nThe drive to the Dome was across a city that had rubbed half its letters off the signs. He tried not to look and looked. A street name had lost its saint. A pharmacy had become harmacy, and he flinched because the joke was cruelly good, the apes always good with the pun when they wanted to be. A diner\u2019s WINDOW SERVICE NOW OPEN had become WIN OW SER VICE NOW PEN, and he felt a particular grief for the missing D as if he had a friend with that initial who had failed to show up for a subway rendezvous. His brain was a drunk at a party where someone is doing coin tricks. He wanted to sit down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing it,\u201d Creel said, almost an apology. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the lacunae.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, and hated himself and did not take it back.\n\nAt the Dome, the banners were organized into obedience like schoolchildren whose teacher had a stick. The word WE had been reinforced so thick with paint that it gleamed in a third dimension. He wondered if he could unmake a pronoun and what the riot would be like then. He wondered if the drawer would scold him for the thought. The car let them out at a side door where the people who do the noise do their noise from, and he felt in the pocket of the building the way a mouse must feel when it runs along the baseboard. He was not made for these rooms that professionalized sound. He liked noises that came from kettles and the very particular squeak of a page you turn too slowly.\n\nIn a holding area that smelled like dust that thought too highly of itself, Creel took the string-bound packet from him and set it on the table and touched it with two fingers like a woman touching her wedding dress in a photograph. Kass watched the door. The door watched itself in the reflective plate and prepared to open for something large. There were men with wires in their ears and another woman with a suit that looked as if it had been cut with a knife you use for meat and not for paper. There was a breeze you only get near men who wear certain shoes.\n\n\u201cYou have three minutes,\u201d Creel said. \u201cHe wants to see the object.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants to see me with the object,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe likes the way we look at one another around important things. He thinks of it as a test of eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a word,\u201d Evan said. \u201cIf anyone threatens me with a word, I have a word.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all do,\u201d Creel said, smiling. \u201cWe all pretend that when we say \u2018cradle\u2019 the room will grow softer. It is my private joy that sometimes it does.\u201d\n\nThale came in like a man doing his best impersonation of a man coming in. There was nothing to say about his size that had not already been said. There was everything to say about the way he held himself slightly to the side of his own body, as if he were reminding himself not to be photographed from the angle he preferred. He sat and he did not smile because smiling had been taken from him by years of people saying you don\u2019t have to, it looks wrong. He leaned forward, and the room leaned forward to meet him, the way a room does for people who have learned to deserve attention across decades of being told to speak.\n\n\u201cMr. Saye,\u201d he said. \u201cYou smell like a plum.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sent them,\u201d Evan said, and then reddened, an old flush he had not felt since he was a boy and had accused a teacher of cheating at a game of hangman and had been wrong.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Thale said. \u201cFruit is a language your people invented for hospitality and we felt left out for a long time. Now we overdo it. It is a national failing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the object,\u201d Creel said, and placed the letters in the center of the table and did not remove the string. Thale made a sound that could have been pleased or could have been disgusted; remind me to ask the linguists, a part of Evan\u2019s brain said, and another part kicked it under the table for trying to survive with hobbies.\n\n\u201cTell me the story,\u201d Thale said, and the way he said it was an insult to storytellers everywhere. He meant:\n\nTell me which lever to pull.\n\nEvan put his hands on either side of the bundle and thought of a picture of an old bomb, the kind with the tail fins. He thought of someone going out to a field with a toolkit that would fit in a purse and lying down next to a threat and humming under their breath while they worked. He thought of the third word. He closed his mouth. He opened it again and chose a half-true thing, the kind of thing poets get crucified for.\n\n\u201cIt makes room,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was a beat like the beat between a threat and a swing. Thale did not move his head and managed to look at him differently. \u201cWhere?\u201d the Primarch said.\n\n\u201cIn lists,\u201d Evan said. \u201cIn page numbers. In the routes our eyes make when we don\u2019t think we\u2019re moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cUseful,\u201d Thale said, and the word had the politest contempt for the domestic he had ever heard. It was the voice of a king being told how to darn. \u201cWe can make good use of that. We can make people not go where they would go if they could read where to go. We can make crowds soft.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can unmake your own gravity,\u201d Evan said, surprising himself, surprising Kass with the speed of her head turn, surprising Creel with the way she set her lips. \u201cYou can forget how to walk back to the place you built for us. You can lose the trail; it\u2019s not a threat, it\u2019s a fact. You do not get to be the only makers of habit in this city and then resent the habit when it goes on without you for a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are here,\u201d Thale said. He did not hit the word the way he did in speeches. He lapped it like a drink. \u201cAnd you remain charming in a way we have decided to keep. Tell me the word that opens it.\u201d\n\nEvan looked at his own reflection in the polished metal housed in the corner and saw a man who might as well be wearing a tie all wrong. He saw the missing numbers on the page and the missing dog and the missing saint. He saw the spoon. He saw his father\u2019s empty chair. He saw Eider\u2019s bird drawn with a hand that had not wanted to sign a name. He thought of the instruction, the things you should not do because you will be the monkey at the tea party moving tiny cups around for someone else\u2019s entertainment. He thought of routes and of removing them and of crowds that cannot get back in time to be counted.\n\n\u201cCradle,\u201d he said, not because it answered the question, but because the word in his mouth was a little cave with a small fire in it, and he had felt cold for years. The guards moved as if someone had corrected their posture. Creel looked like someone whose joke had finally been told back to her and landed. Kass had the expression of a person adding two odd numbers and getting an even number that had a second sense.\n\n\u201cYou know that word,\u201d Thale said, and there was something like admiration in the bottom of his voice like a coin lost in a couch. \u201cWe are learning it. You have such good words for how you hold fragile things and we have such good hands. It is a pity for you that language turned out to be a cabinet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t open it,\u201d Evan said. \u201cWalk around it. Build a table instead and we\u2019ll eat at it until we die and no one will know there was a cabinet.\u201d\n\nThale laughed, a sound like dropped stones arranged all at once into a wall. \u201cWalk around it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou speak like a man who has never been turned away from a door. We walked around your world for a century and brought you your own baskets and your own paper and your own ballots and your own dead from the downcountry and now we would like to open something when we are tired.\u201d\n\nHe put his hand on the packet, and the drawer in Evan\u2019s apartment, across the river and up three flights and under a window where the morning had drawn itself like a simple line, shivered as if a sleeping animal had rolled to face the wall. He put the other hand on the table, and the table made a noise as if remembering the person who had built it and regretting the joints.\n\n\u201cYou will tell us the word,\u201d Thale said, and it was not a threat. It was the softest prediction. \u201cYou will not like the music otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe music?\u201d Mina said, coming in because she had refused not to come in, because Creel had looked away at the wrong moment thinking someone else had barred the door and no one had. \u201cAlways with the music metaphors. You all are so predictable.\u201d\n\nThale turned his head and looked at her and folded gentleness around his eyes the way you fold napkins because the guest is a woman and you want to look good in your civil grooming. \u201cWe have been mocked for our love of percussion,\u201d he said, and his mouth did something almost like amusement. \u201cWe have learned melody. Forgive us for our new love.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina said. \u201cI don\u2019t forgive you anything. I have a list. It has the word \u201cferry\u201d on it a hundred times. You\u2019re not the first tyrant who liked a tune.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvan,\u201d June said, very softly, because she could feel what was about to happen as if she were standing in the same room as the weather. \u201cDon\u2019t say the name.\u201d\n\nHe could have said it then, in a room covered by cameras and men and promises. He could have said the name that would turn the drawer into a fact for people who thought facts were warheads. He could have placed the word in the world and watched it behave. He did not. He stepped back in his mind a half-inch, the way his father had put his hand on his back and pushed him forward. He stepped backward instead, and in that small refusal there was a music that belonged only to him.\n\n\u201cI will say nothing in front of him,\u201d he said, because saying him was a disrespect you could get away with, a tiny, private spit in the soup. \u201cI will write it on paper and put it under a fruit. I will tell my detective. I will whisper it into the drawer and swim.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are charming,\u201d Thale said again, and this time it was the same as being called something else. \u201cTake him home,\u201d he said to no one and everyone. \u201cFeed him. Watch the numbers.\u201d\n\nThey took him home. He asked if he could stop for milk, and they said no in a way that told him yes, later, when you walk again like a man and we are the wall you walk along with your hand trailing it for comfort. Mina did not speak until they were three blocks from the Dome and the driver had relaxed into the small slouch of a person who has performed his scene correctly and has been told so by an internal buzzer unknown to his boss.\n\n\u201cIf you had said it,\u201d she said, and did not have to define it, \u201cwhat would you have been?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe instrument,\u201d he said, and hated the easy answer. \u201cThe handle. The hand holding the handle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used to tell me that sentence diagrams were a way to see a soul,\u201d she said, and it was one of those times when someone who loves you throws your own good line at your face to see what it does. \u201cWhat is the sentence now?\u201d\n\nHe saw it in the air. Subject: He. Verb: will. Object: us. He scratched it with his finger in the fog on the window and then wiped the window clean with the flat of his palm because he didn\u2019t want to get used to that diagram. He wanted to backspace it until it became only a smudge on glass and then nothing at all.\n\nAt home, the banner had turned itself quarter-way around on the pole. It read WE WILL NO and then was blank where the rest should be and then CH OTHER, a tender malapropism that made him want to cry. He went up the stairs. He counted again because he liked to torment himself with the possibility that the number had changed and on the ninth stair he realized a step had always been a step and he had better get used to certain kinds of disappointment.\n\nThe drawer waited like a dog with a toy in its mouth pretending disinterest. He stood with his hands on his hips like a man who had lost his keys in a movie. June took off her shoes. Mina sucked a piece of plum from her molar with a little pop.\n\nHe opened the drawer and said nothing. He looked at the pale blue paper and the envelope with the absent glue and the stamp he had chewed and the corner of the bottom letter with the bird. He looked at his own carefulness written in the way he had tucked one corner under another to keep the edges unfrayed. He remembered something his father had said in a voice he had not used often, the soft voice he reserved for secrets not because he loved secrets but because he hated the ugliness of what happens to truth when you leave it out on the counter.\n\nIf you can resist the moment of being the person who does the violent, you will become the person who makes the room. We need a room, Evan. We need a room where the thing that must be said can be said without the wrong ears. Leave it empty as long as you can. A room is the best thing we ever invented. Better than the wheel.\n\nHe had wanted to argue\u2014he had, indeed, argued then, fourteen or twenty-two or forty, he could not remember which\u2014but the drawer gave him the sensation of answering in his bones again, and the answer was temperate and hard.\n\nLater, it said, in a voice that would not be a voice. Later, when we have taken the route to their chair. Later, when their steps will take them somewhere else and they will ask us to forgive them for the inconvenience of it, and we will not forgive them, because we are not their priests. Later, and then you can say it, and it will be a word said into an empty, and it will not make a sound anyone can hear who does not love you.\n\nHe closed the drawer with a motion he had perfected as a child, a neat push and a small, responsible thump. He went to the window and watched the wind find new ways to move the dead bird of the banner. He thought of destroy as an emptiness verb and spoke it silently as if it were grace. He made tea with a spoon that had learned how to remain and he counted the page numbers he could see from across the room without getting up and left the missing one missing.\n\nWhen the second motorcade of the day passed\u2014sleeker, younger at the wheel, a new smell of hot plastic and something floral he hated without knowing the name for\u2014he did not go to the drawer like an obedient dog. He stood and he hid his hands in his pockets and he waited for the part of himself that loved obedience to go lie down on the rug. He could feel it, that part, yawning itself into gentleness. He loved it. He feared it. He fed it and did not pet it.\n\nNight would come with its small argument and its chorus of window air conditioners in the buildings that had them and its chorus of mouths in the buildings that did not. Somewhere in the middle of that song he would say the third word into the drawer and there would be a light that was not light and a disappearance that was not a theft, not in the way they meant theft in the Ministries. He would remove the route to the chair that had been built for him with his own name printed under it. He would make a room. He would fail and he would succeed and the measure of each would be a thing none of them yet had the math to speak.\n\nHe boiled the kettle again, because habit is a religion when God is in hiding. He held the cup under his nose, and the steam made his eyes water as if from honest feeling. Mina put her head on his shoulder and then took it away because she had rules she never told anyone, rules like use everything twice before you tell someone you are out of it and do not borrow sugar and do not let your man see you weep unless you would like him to weep too. June wrote the word route in her notebook and then drew something that could have been a map or a river or a child\u2019s scribble meant to be a house.\n\nHe would open the drawer when he was ready and when it was ready and when the hum in the radiator told the fillings in his teeth their names. He would say the name then, and it would be in the shape of a bird folding and unfolding its wings in a place where there is no sky. He had never wanted to be anyone\u2019s lever. He wanted to be an archivist with opinions about kettles. He was both now, and that would be the joke, and one day, if there were a day left for it, he would laugh.Night laid itself across the city with the grudging thoroughness of a bureaucrat stamping forms, and the building made the sounds of a building deciding which of its old noises to keep and which to let go. Evan waited for his nervous system to stop acting like a campsite and for the pebbly thrill along his spine to admit it was not a useful alarm. He washed the cups again as if cleanliness could legislate order, and he dried them with the dish towel with the faded pears that had belonged to his mother, and he thought that the towel had outlived so many regimes that it deserved to vote. Mina spoke in the living room without raising her voice, telling June a story about a man who had tried to interview a banner as if it were a person with a position on the world, and June made listening noises with her eyebrows because the habit of not letting your face be a transcript had kept her employed when other people had become printouts with pulses. The drawer held still with the patience of a stagehand who has hit the cue and must now let the actors believe they are free.\n\nHe had expected a horn in his head to signal the exact moment, something martial or mystical, a commandment handed down by a god that had finally remembered his name after making him wait in the anteroom with the other mortals, but what he got instead was a small domestic certainty, the one he felt on winter Tuesdays when the radiator\u2019s first tick told him the heat would hold through the night and nothing would burst in the pipes behind the wall that had never once asked his permission to be a wall. He moved to the desk with the same care he used when he pulled old forms from boxes in climate-controlled rooms where the air stayed at sixty-eight degrees like a vow, and he slid the drawer open to its agreed mouth. The letters attended, not animate and not inanimate exactly, the way the sea attends a boat that has been placed on it by hands that know boats, and he put his finger on the corner with the bird and spoke the word he had not wanted to own, not because it would make him bad, though it might, but because it would make him a person who had done something irreversible and he had built so much of himself atop the reversible.\n\nHe did not announce it to the room like a madman in a legend. He did not write it on a piece of paper first to see if the paper would shudder. He did not try it on with a whisper and then fit it more tightly with a shout. He said the name with the exact voice he used when he answered the listless roll calls of his profession, the Here that promises nothing and keeps it perfectly, and it left his mouth with a shape that was not a shape language should keep, a curve that would not diagram. He felt it catch on the grain and sit there, not absorbed and not reflected, and for a heartbeat he was terrified he had done nothing but make a fool noise at furniture, and then the room did that small bow again and the apartment forgot one little habit and the city, obedient to its own routes, discovered it was one step off the dance.\n\nLight that was not light did not flood anything. It unoccupied and left, as if someone had been sitting on a bench and stood up and you arrived in time to feel the heat in the wood and the indentation and the absence, the most articulate shape you had ever known. The kettle on the stove made the tiny smacking sound kettles make when they re-learn silence and the radiator went quiet in the same way rooms go quiet when people who are not invited enter them. Across the river, far enough that a noise should have been nothing but a rumor, there was the kind of murmuration you hear when a crowd moves and does not move and cannot explain to itself why it does either. He did not look out the window as if the looking could make him responsible. He watched the page of the landscape book where the number had once been and saw that now, instead of an empty corner, the gutter held a slightly darker white, the hint that a number had been peeled up like tape and carried away on the air to be stuck somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIt worked,\u201d Mina said, because she would always say a thing like that when she was scared and exhausted and furious, and then she put her hand on the counter because something in her wanted to grip a surface that had never tried to decide her fate. June did not say it worked because she was keeping a ledger in her head with a column labeled What It Cost and another labeled What We Tell Later, and she wrote in both columns with the same pencil and neither came out of it richer.\n\nThey learned what had been removed an hour later when the Dome, which had been built on the principle that whatever you cannot dignify you can at least organize, failed to locate its own stairs. The feed that used to be called public flickered and steadied and the shot held on a door that would not agree to be an entrance, and the camera tried to look at the stage and found only a rectangle that did not accept attention. People in coats you could recognize by cut moved with the purposeful uselessness of those who can only be in charge when the room has already agreed to the sequence, and a woman with a scarf that was no one\u2019s had a conversation with a man whose job was to lower lights and raise them, and neither of them made a light do anything at all. The teleprompter displayed the syllable We and then reconsidered. The band, because there is always a band when a state wants a story, played the first notes of a tune that wanted to be a hymn and could not get to its verb, and then they switched to something forgiving that could tolerate being stopped and started and stopped again. Evan stood with the tea he had not drunk and thought of sentences left without their heart and of the way objects get mean when you ask them to be metaphors for too long.\n\nHe did not feel triumph because triumph would have required a belief in a finish line and the letter had cured him of that disease. He felt only the relief of a man whose unwelcome guests have taken a wrong turn into a closet and are now arguing about where the kitchen went. June lowered her head and listened the way you listen to a building after a snowstorm, to see whether the roof is sorry for being a roof, and she shook her head once like a person who has learned to lower her expectations by quarter-inches and acre-feet. Mina went to the radio and turned it not on, because the radio had become an actor in this drama in a way that made everyone in the room feel watched, but down as if it were too loud already, and the gesture was so hospitable that it broke Evan\u2019s heart in a way that did not injure him.\n\nA car they knew was polite idled below and did not honk because honking had been disciplined into a class signifier and discipline is a form of love we offer power when we are tired. Evan did not give the drawer a reassuring pat because he would not patronize the thing that had become, however temporarily, the most useful technology he owned. He put his palms flat and did not press and waited to see if the wood would do the thing wood does when it becomes a screen, when you can look through it and see your own face and recognize the person in that face as a citizen of an era he had refused to join until the era had sat down at his table and asked him for sugar.\n\nKass came first, not quite out of breath, but wearing the face that people wear when they have run for five minutes in shoes designed for rooms and must pretend they were always gliding. She did not knock like a policeman or a cousin; she knocked like a woman who had learned the ritual of announcing herself and not alarming detectives. Creel followed and stood a pace behind her as if observing an art practice, as if she were about to ask questions about process and influence, and her scarf today had small squares like windows and he hated that he noticed because noticing had become a confession. They looked at the drawer with professional manners, which is to say they did not look at it at all.\n\n\u201cWhat did you take,\u201d Creel asked, and she used the softest preterite because sympathy, in the mouths of Ministers, is always set in the past tense.\n\n\u201cWe took nothing,\u201d June answered before Evan could find the line in himself he wanted to deliver, and her voice was water at the lip of a dam, even, depressurized, convincing because it was true. \u201cThe route removed itself from a thing it had no business being attached to. If you built a stage without stairs, that\u2019s on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t on us,\u201d Kass said, and then she shut her mouth as if she had put her thumb on a vein and found it too eager, and Creel did not correct her because Kass had done them the favor of sounding human and not harmonized. Mina made a noise that could be taken for a cough if you wanted to be courteous and an insult if you did not, and she put the kettle back on the stove without asking anyone whether anyone wanted anything.\n\n\u201cI am supposed to ask you to accompany us,\u201d Creel said, and she put her hands in her pockets so he could not see whether the callus had changed since morning. \u201cI am supposed to tell you that it is safe. I am supposed to say that this is for all our benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour words want to be furniture,\u201d Evan said. He did not raise his voice and he did not let it be clever and he did not perform anything resembling courage. \u201cYou put them in rooms and hope people will sit on them and call it a home. I do not live in your house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ask you to,\u201d Creel said, and he almost liked her for the lie. \u201cWe ask you to let us look at your chairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not his chairs,\u201d Mina said, and she moved to a place between Creel and the desk that was not quite a barricade because Mina did not mistake herself for furniture. \u201cThey belong to the city. He keeps them for us because the city asked his father to keep them and then forgot how to ask in a decent way and now you come in with your grammar and ask us to be polite while you translate it.\u201d\n\nKass had the air of a person who disagrees at a molecular level and also knows she will be fired if her molecules show. \u201cHe did something,\u201d she said, and she wasn\u2019t accusing him so much as making a note she could file under Her Own Name for later. \u201cIt didn\u2019t move the walls. It moved the ways. I don\u2019t know how to fight a person who moves ways. I only know how to stand in a path and then get out of it when ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can try standing in a habit,\u201d June suggested, and it was an old detective joke in a city where criminality had become administrative and order had become language. \u201cIt will bow around you if you are polite enough and if you are rude enough it will make a new river. I don\u2019t like either option, so I am rehearsing a third where I write down what people forget to say because they are busy obeying their own sentences.\u201d\n\nThey made a shape in the kitchen that had never existed in that room before: two women employed by a Ministry standing in the house of a man who had just altered the morning\u2019s architecture, a reporter holding a kettle that had not yet announced itself, a detective with her socks on wood and her pencil near paper, and a drawer of letters that now felt less like a container than like a weather system with a small, precisely drawn map taped to its lid. It was almost a family, the kind that meets at a hospital cafeteria near the gift shop and uses humor as an intravenous fluid. Evan thought of his father\u2019s hand making air-cursive, the way he had traced the idea of left-left-right-left until it could have steered a boat.\n\n\u201cWe have to go back,\u201d Creel said, and it was not a demand; it was a confession of the life she had, the one where walking back was the only walking there was. \u201cThey will ask us to say the word and we will say it and the door will do nothing and someone will get angry and ask us to say it louder. We will need a way to pretend something has been accomplished and then another way to pretend there was no need for accomplishment in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them your stairs are in a room that asked not to be walked on today,\u201d Mina said, and the cruelty of the line pleased her and she hated that the pleasure was available. \u201cTell them the people who wrote the ceremony forgot to give it a body.\u201d\n\nKass looked at Evan and did not speak, and the silence she made was more articulate than anything her Minister could have issued as a statement. He understood it, the way you understand someone on a bus who does not meet your eyes and then meets them for the half-beat it takes to establish you share a country. She wanted a word and not the word they had been trained to say and he could not give it to her because the word belonged in a room, not on a stage, not under a banner that had lost its verb.\n\nAfter they left, the building unclenched a notch and the window breathed and the banner outside completed its clumsy revolution so that the new message spelled itself with accidental tenderness: WE WILL NO CH OTHER, which read like the promise of a cramped future, cheaper and smaller and more companionable than any of them had planned, a vow to know each other as they became what they did not want to be and did not know how to avoid. Evan sat with the letters and did not touch them, and Mina opened a plum and gave half to June and half to him and kept none for herself as if she were practicing an asceticism that would keep her pure for some future she did not believe in.\n\n\u201cYou will have to do it again,\u201d June said finally, and she did not say it like a strategist. \u201cThey will find routes we didn\u2019t see. They will build new ones out of our own feet. They will turn our errand paths into their processions. They always do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, and the knowledge sat in his stomach like the wrong kind of medicine, helpful in principle and caustic in practice. \u201cI am trying to be a child who pushes a chair under a doorknob for a minute. I am not trying to be the person who invents a new door.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letters did not pick you for modesty,\u201d Mina said, and she did not disguise the affection in the irony. \u201cThey picked you because you hoard rooms. You keep a drawer like some people keep pets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I have to feed it,\u201d he said, and the thought made him laugh and then stop laughing because there was an etiquette to ridiculousness and the drawer had earned the right not to be laughed at. \u201cI have to choose what routes to starve and which to leave alone. I do not want to starve anyone into stupidity. I only want to make a moment when someone who never has to hesitate will have to hesitate, and in that hesitation remember that we have been hesitating for years.\u201d\n\nHe slept badly and in small, mean slices that did not deserve the name sleep, and the letters came and went in those slices like streetlights beyond a train window. He dreamed of a library where the catalog drawers had emptied themselves onto the floor and the little rods that once kept the cards in order had become snakes that only ate punctuation, and when he woke he was irritated that his unconscious had tried to be helpful and failed to be original. In the second bad slice he dreamed of his father laughing at a joke neither of them had told yet and then turning his head to listen to someone else finishing it, and in the third he dreamed of a bird that was not a bird and a name that was not a name laid across a line of type like the hand that stops someone from signing an agreement they cannot possibly comprehend and are too tired not to.\n\nMorning tugged him up into itself like a babysitter with someplace else to be, and the windows were ordinary and the floorboards were indifferent and the kettle was bravely itself, and he had a hunger he understood as guilt and not as appetite. There were messages, because messages breed at night in a city that has forgotten how to sleep, and one was from a source Mina did not formally have, a nurse at a clinic near the river who had learned to use her hands to move people out of rooms quietly when certain men with badges and certain men without them decided to make their own furniture where none had been provided. The message said only that the Dome had gone still and then had moved again and that the Primarch had decided to perform a different scene in a different room and that the rearrangement had cost two guards a promotion and a woman with the wrong shoes her paycheck. The other message was from no one, which is to say it arrived with no address and no provenance and the exact cadence of a memo pinned to a corkboard with a black pin.\n\nIt said that there were certain routes that could not be interfered with without offending the river, and June read it over his shoulder and said aloud that this was the kind of metaphoric warning you give when you have learned to respect your own mysticism and refuse to be embarrassed by it. It said there were names he should not learn because once learned they would try to live in his house and would never take the trash out. It said, with a politeness that made him think of his father\u2019s generation of professors, that humility when wielded by the wrong person becomes a weapon, and he wrote the sentence in the margin of the letter that had been about spoons and told himself he was not, in fact, defacing a sacred thing but glossing a manual.\n\nHe did not hear from Eider in a way that would have satisfied him, no voice, no new agreement in his bones, no syllable wearing a mask. He heard, instead, the mouth-mouth sound of the city trying to find its lips after being slapped. The shop on the corner had relabeled the baskets where bags used to be kept and had called them Elsewhere because the owner had a sense of humor about his inability to get plastic and his refusal to fail at generosity, and Evan bought one and put the letters in it and felt both pathetic and practical and decided that these were, after all, the twin virtues of men who do not like war.\n\nWhen he stepped into the hallway with the basket on his arm he saw Kass on the landing above, and for a moment they faced one another like neighbors who have, after years of pretending, finally noticed that they share a wall. She did not reach for her lapel. She did not make the sign that would turn the corridor into protocol. She said, in the everyday voice of a woman in old shoes, that the Dome would move itself to another river today and then move back and that there would be a demonstration of patience to replace the demonstration of power, and then she asked if his kettle worked because hers did not and this was her third apartment in ten years and she would like, just once, to be able to boil water without asking a man across the hall for a favor.\n\nHe invited her in because there is a set of small courtesies you refuse to abandon when the big ones have been made obscene, and he made them all tea and watched the way Kass held the cup with both hands, one on the lip and one on the belly, and he cataloged it without deciding whether it made her Benedict Arnold or a woman with cold fingers. She did not look at the drawer and she did not say the word cradle and he liked her better for living for a minute outside the grammar of her job. She told a story about her grandmother and a gas stove in a country that had not wanted her grandmother and a policeman who had wanted to borrow her grandmother\u2019s scarf as a favor and had never returned it, and the story was so plainly told that he forgave it for banging the old pots in the old kitchen in his head.\n\nMina asked her, with a journalist\u2019s sideways, what it was like to stand next to a speech that wanted to be a mountain and discover it was a hill, and Kass said she could not answer because her mother had taught her not to discuss topography with reporters in kitchens, and they both laughed because women of their age had been taught too many lessons about kitchens and had complied with too few for anyone\u2019s comfort. June wrote nothing because sometimes the best way to gather a room is to deprive it of the sound of a pencil.\n\n\u201cTell me what you intend,\u201d Kass said finally, and she put the cup down like someone who knows the sound of ceramic on wood and respects it. \u201cNot from the vantage of a symbol, not from the vantage of one of your little generational meta-jokes about drawers, not even from the vantage of a son. From the vantage of a man who has found a tool. What job do you plan to do with it.\u201d\n\nHe could have made a fool\u2019s speech about justice and been forgiven because fools are always forgiven by history when they lose. He could have said nothing and been hated by both sides, which is a luxury if you let it be. He said instead that he intended to pull the routes out from under their rituals one by one until ceremony became embarrassing and that he would stop two minutes before he became a person who loved the embarrassment more than the relief, and when he finished Kass nodded the way people nod when they hear their own compromise spoken back at them. She did not tell him to be careful, because that is what you say to people who will die in the ordinary ways you fear. She told him to be quiet when quiet would hurt more and to be loud when loudness would make someone else retreat into their corner without shooting, and he wanted to give her some of the credit if they ever got to the day where there was credit to give.\n\nHe learned the body-language of the city in the week that followed like a freshman learning a new campus by walking between buildings at night. He learned to see the places where traffic had accustomed itself to certain left turns and to imagine what it would be like if left were corrected into not yet. He learned that trains were the bones of movement and that bones belonged to no Ministry, and he learned that if you touched a schedule in the right place with the right word you could make two cars arrive at once and then no cars arrive at all and the platform would become a church where people decided what they believed about their neighbors. He learned to step away from the temptation to remove routes to medicine and routes to rooms with cribs in them and routes to the courthouses where ordinary selfishness was still being adjudicated by tired men in clean shirts. He learned, in short, the liberal arts of sabotage and restraint.\n\nThe letters accompanied, and he stopped pretending they were ghosted by one person with a bird to his name and started reading them as a chorus that had learned to harmonize without being taught. A paragraph from the lazy-precise hand would be followed by an insert in a hand that had once been forced to write with its left because a teacher had believed in superstitions about Satan and the hand. The choruses disagreed about etiquette and agreed about time. They told him which days repeated and which days were new, they told him how to recognize the place in a sentence where the subject will lose its interest and the object will try to wriggle free, and they told him not to attempt anything on days when the light from the river came into the room in a stripe one hand wide, because that stripe was a superstition different from theirs and he should respect someone else\u2019s altar.\n\nJune stood at the window and watched the banners as if they were a pulse, and she watched the chalk on the sidewalk as if it were a language that would not be committed to paper, and she told him when to stop. Mina built a story that did not reveal the mechanism, and in doing so she rediscovered the meaning of the word responsibility, which had been used so many times by so many men to mean stand in the door until I am finished speaking that it had come to mean nothing at all. Kass came up the stairs with a grocery bag twice and pretended to be a woman with onions and not an emissary, and Creel paused at the corner and looked up at the window the way people look at apartments they have not been invited into and would like someday to write about as if they had.\n\nThe Primarch performed a kindness one evening that made the city forgive him for a full seven minutes, and Evan watched it and felt human against his will. He walked into a clinic where the elevator had been refusing to align its door with the floor for a week and he took the door with his hands and held it until the elevator sighed and gave in, and he stood there while women with sleeping babies and men with bandaged thumbs and a person whose gender Evan wished he had the courage not to notice slipped out and said thank you with the dry humor of the poor. If he had been that man only, if he had been only a person in a room with a door and a problem and two good hands, Evan would have built him a chair in his kitchen and served him tea and found a way to forgive the entire century for naming him with a title that made the tongue proud. He had to remember the banners. He had to remember the stairs. He had to remember his father\u2019s hand moving in the space above a table where no one was allowed to put elbows.\n\nOn the tenth day, when the routes they had removed had been replaced with improvised paths that made the city look like a person who had learned to walk again after a car accident, a letter arrived that had no envelope and no stamp and had been slid under the door by a person who had learned the art of not troubling floors. It told him to bring a thing to a room at a time when that room would be empty. It told him that the person who would meet him there had a pocket that rattled because of a coin that had crossed three countries and ten hands. It told him that if he heard the coin, he would know which route to take, and if he did not, he should go home and make tea and promise no one anything for eighteen hours and then forget he had promised and begin again.\n\nHe went because there are errands you do for your dead and errands you do for your living and errands you do for the part of yourself that you hope can be forgiven, and this felt like all three. June stayed because she was watching the weather in the letters, and Mina came because she had once followed a school bus to the wrong school by mistake and had discovered an entire neighborhood of faces she had not known belonged to her city and had been forgiven by a principal who had smelled of chalk and good jokes. He carried the Elsewhere basket like a joke so old it had become furniture. He listened in the hallway for a rattle and heard nine other sounds instead, all competently made, all designed to imitate normalcy with the innocent malice of children pretending to be adults at a tea party with tiny cups.\n\nThere was no coin. There was a room, and in it a table, and on it a bowl of fruit because the city had decided to sneeze at coincidence and be done with it. Kass was there and looked like a woman who had forgotten to brush her hair and had remembered to carry her keys, and Creel was not there and he was grateful because he did not want to be forgiven today. There was another person, and she wore earrings that had been made by hands that had once made snares, and she introduced herself not by name but by a fact: she had been a librarian at a place where people learned to read again after the floods and had taught them how to be kind to paper with wet hands.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll think I am Eider,\u201d she said, and she put her hands on either side of the bowl as if they needed to learn how to be near roundness without taking. \u201cI am not Eider. Eider is not a person or a bird. Eider is a hurt done to a bird and the name we gave the hurt so we could love it without losing ourselves in the apology. You can call me by my name if you must, but it will be wet in your mouth and you will spit in your own hand and I do not think you want that moment on your conscience.\u201d\n\nHe did not ask for her name because the drawer had cured him of certain kinds of hunger. He asked her, instead, what she wanted from him that he had not already given away in public by making men in suits circle back to find their way to microphones. She said she wanted him to go smaller, and his heart rose and then dropped like a small ride at a cheap fair.\n\n\u201cYou have a romance with stairs now,\u201d she told him, and she did not make it unkind because she could see he had been withholding romance from himself for years and had only let it out to graze when he discovered it could eat the legs of podiums. \u201cI want you to notice the way a form is filled. I want you to remove the route by which a man puts his name in a box without reading the sentence above the box. I want you to take the habit out of the hand that signs. I want the city to hesitate for two seconds every time a signature is asked. I want the ceremony of the number to become a thing people have to actually perform, not a thing their hand does while their mind is in the room with the nicest lamp.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because it was better than crying in front of a stranger and because crying in front of a librarian feels like an insult to the oldest kind of privacy. He said he could try and that he would hate himself and that he would love himself and that he would do it anyway and that he would stop if children did not get milk and if a woman did not get her test results and if a man did not get to see his brother in a room with a phone. She said she would help him draw maps with his eyes closed and he found he believed her because her earrings barely moved when she nodded and because he had become a man who took cues from jewelry when the world refused to speak plainly.\n\nIn the street, the banners had shed their insistence; the verbs were back and the pronouns were shy and the children had begun to draw their own words not because anyone had asked them to and not because a generous adult had bought them chalk in a moment of noblesse oblige, but because they had seen other children do it and felt the itch at the end of their wrists. He watched a boy write the word WAIT on a stoop and then sit on the letter A because it had a belly, and he felt something that was not pride and not joy and not victory and not relief but a small, precise gladness that belonged to no one and did not need to be administered by a Ministry.\n\nThat night, when the drawer hummed like a neighbor with a new washing machine in a building that trembles at the gaiety of appliances, when the radiator ticked the right music again, when the city lay down and got up and went elsewhere and came back, he put his hands flat and thanked nothing. It was not an American prayer and it was not a prayer from any of his grandparents\u2019 cupboards. It was a sentence without a verb that wanted it, and the wanting did most of the work. He slept as if a room had been made around him that had not been there before, not because someone had built it and given it to him, but because he had removed a path that led to him and thus had made a space no one could enter without first remembering he was a person and not an address.\n\nIn the morning, there were fewer numbers where numbers had once stood as if men at podiums had grown shy, and there were more names spoken aloud to cashiers because signing had become interesting and the act of asking had become a tiny theater. There were delays that did no harm and headaches that meant nothing and announcements that doubled themselves and then apologized with a trumpet. There were letters in the drawer that had started to smell like oranges and libraries and the inside of a new shoe. There were new instructions and new cautions and a penciled-in addition from a hand he had not seen before that said, in a tone that made him think of a mother making soup at a window, that the hardest thing about making room is leaving it unfilled, and that he should keep his chairs empty as long as he could bear it, and then, when he could not, he should fill them with bodies and not objects and he should let those bodies be bored.\n\nHe turned to June and said he would try, and she said they would watch him, and he turned to Mina and said he would fail, and she said she would write it down and later, if any of them remained, she would make it funny in a way that would not hurt anyone who did not deserve it. He touched the drawer like a man touching the doorstep of a house he knew he would not live in forever but could not imagine leaving, and outside the banner had been mended with tape that reflected light in a way that made the rip look like a design, and a girl with a cowlick and a lollipop dragged a piece of chalk across the sidewalk and wrote the word ROOM and drew a door and then wrote NO under the door and then crossed out the NO and wrote NOT YET in careful capitals that would have pleased a schoolteacher or a god.The morning after the word became a room, the city woke with a hangover of altered habits. People approached counters and looked down at the small sanctity of a box with a line under it and felt their hand hesitate in a way that was not protest and not obedience. Clerks developed a new posture that involved gentler pointing and an extra syllable on please. A woman at the registry of contracts pressed the pen toward a man who had signed that same form six winters running and watched him blink as if seeing his name for the first time, as if the embroidery his hand knew by heart had been unpicked in the night. Evan walked through the lobby with his Elsewhere basket like a man bringing bread to a very modest, very temperamental goddess, and he felt the Drawer in the marrow of the building like a seriousness. The habit of signature had been notched; it would take weeks to see if the notch became a tooth or a mercy.\n\nHe practiced small. He learned the weight of what his father had called the attention of objects, and he aimed that attention at a mall kiosk where a boy had been taught to flip phones with the proud despair of youth in economies like ours, and the boy felt himself reach for the word upgrade and decide, without knowing why, to say instead, Wait. He touched a laminated evacuation map in a day-care center with his mind as delicately as he would touch a sleeping infant\u2019s wrist, and he moved the red arrow that wanted so badly to mean YOU to a calmer place where the corridor it implied did not run toward the wrong door. He wrote nothing down for the Drawer that morning other than a single sentence on an old envelope: today I will not be tempted by stairs.\n\nJune took the new slowness of the city and made of it a surveillance she could live with. She stood three hours at the foot of the bridge that had been renamed and then renamed again and then left as an empty noun, and she watched the choreography that the apes had brought with them, the security habit of funneling and looping and shutting and opening that had so often turned into a kind of public music no one had wanted to learn. She called him at noon and spoke the way she spoke when she wanted his brain to hold still while she pinned a thought to it. They are practicing with us, she said. They are switching to thumbprints at the registry\u2014not because it is safer, because it isn\u2019t\u2014but because they want to rehearse something their bodies already understand. You got under their hand; they will try to make the hand into the entire law.\n\nMina took the slowness and went to see what people did with it. She returned with a story about a couple at the marriage office who had been about to sign and had stopped because the groom\u2019s hand had become shy and the bride\u2019s hand had become solemn, and the clerk had said, I know, and had found a joke that did not hurt anyone and then found the sentence that made them both laugh and then the groom had signed and the bride had signed and it felt like two people borrowing a word and making it theirs. Mina wanted to write this down and knew that to write it down in the old way would be to give someone in an office the idea of how to make it an advertisement, so she wrote it down instead in a notebook with the names removed and the verbs changed and the ratio of pronouns adjusted until the whole thing felt like a childhood memory she could test language against for honesty.\n\nCreel sent nothing that day, which was as eloquent as a bouquet, and Kass sent five colors of silence. In the afternoon, a woman with a lanyard and a laminated card that said ATTENDANT OF GESTURE took up a post by the city records desk and offered to demonstrate to citizens how to sign in a new way that would preserve the efficiency of the office while acknowledging the new abundance of feeling. She held their hands without touching them, and people submitted, and Evan had the pure unhelpful impulse to go home and remove the route by which lanyards acquired authority. He restrained himself because he was learning a terrible and necessary calculus: every route removed created, like a good edit, a breath and an opportunity for someone else to move into that new air. He wanted to choose who that someone else would be. He could not. That was the point of rooms, his father\u2019s voice said. You do not get to love only the people you invite in.\n\nIn the Drawer there was a letter with no salutation, which made it feel like instruction rather than kinship. It said, in a handwriting he thought might be his father\u2019s and might be the immaculate-untidy one he trusted when the nights were medicinal, that the next thing to practice was the pause between the form and the pen. You are excited by the moment the hand disobeys the habit, the letter scolded gently, and you are an enthusiast of sudden reversals because you were cross with yourself for years for loving small things too much and forgetting to love large things as if they were small. Slow yourself. Take the route that leads from box to name and unhook it at the elbow. People can still sign. They will merely have to locate their name rather than have it spring to meet their hand like a dog.\n\nHe tried. He stood with his palms on the old wood as if warming them at a fire and described, with the weak but persistent arrogance of a man who has begun to trust description as a lever, the exact micro-gesture that preceded signatures in offices this year: the way a person looks down and sees the line and the space and even without reading the sentence above\u2014the one about understanding and agreeing\u2014remembers the choreography and lowers the wrist and lets the pen do what pens are so eager to do. He asked the Drawer to make a little room right there, between seeing and lowering, and the Drawer obliged with the smallest adjustment, a quiet of attention, as if a very polite usher had placed a hand to the aisle and paused an impatient guest at the opera for the seven seconds the aria needed not to be ruined.\n\nIf the apes noticed, they were too formally courteous, at least in public, to admit it. The Primarch gave an interview with an old broadcaster who had chosen to age into irrelevance stubbornly rather than gracefully, and the Primarch wrapped his words around the shape of patience with an artistry that made Evan feel a complicated loyalty to language itself. We are learning your hesitations, Thale said, and if he had steepled his fingers like a cartoon villain Evan would have been able to hate him efficiently. We had thought hesitations were a sign of weakness and had been trained to move through them as a runner moves through a cramp. We see now that sometimes the pause is the door. We would like to be invited. He had that tender gravity he could deploy when he wanted to reach into the pockets of his detractors and leave sweets. He had learned pronouns the way other people learn carpentry. He made the old interviewer smile in a way that felt like a part of the city giving up, and Evan had to turn the sound down and put his head under the cold tap and remember to breathe in the part of his chest that, in another life, had been reserved for the patient worship of unnecessary facts.\n\nThat night he dreamed of his father\u2019s chalk, thick and square, leaving ghost on a green board long after the word had been erased, and he woke with a precise memory that made him sit up like a dog rising when it hears the train that brings its person. He had been nine. He had been sassed into silence by a teacher who believed in volume as an educational technology, and his father had taken him to the closed library on a Saturday and had held his hand out and said, Write your name for me, and he had written it with care not because he loved his name but because his father had asked him and he had loved that faithful old trick. His father had not praised the handwriting. He had said, You have just drawn a route to yourself. Later, other people will ask you to draw that route in rooms designed to reward certain routes and punish others. You will be tempted to be very good at drawing it under pressure. Learn another route to yourself now, please. Just in case. And he had laughed, and the laugh had been his best protection against humorless men for years afterward. Evan had drawn a house, and then, shyly, a drawer. He had drawn his father\u2019s hand. He had drawn a little arrow that pointed toward an empty space where the next thing would be and had written the word LATER with a triumphant child\u2019s cruelty toward future selves.\n\nJune brought him a tally with small, gritty categories. She kept lists the way her grandmother had kept beans and rice, reliable in emergencies, soothing when the price of meat rose and fell with political weather. Evictions delayed today, she wrote. Evictions canceled, she wrote, and put a zero next to it without mercy. Children\u2019s appointments missed by mistake; children\u2019s appointments remade the same day because a woman with the talent for contrition had called three numbers until someone said bring the child now. She had a category called Boredom Returned, and she put her pencil on the page and looked at him and said, You would suffer for the return of boredom if it came with no banners. Don\u2019t lie. He didn\u2019t. He hated himself for that honesty and then hated himself for the narcissism of it and then hated himself for being a man spending all his new dangerous energy on the correct distribution of hatred. He made tea and she wrote Boredom Returned: three\u2014that many?\u2014and then she crossed it out and wrote two, and the precinct of his mind that had studied her years ago like a new neighborhood knew that she had crossed it out not because she had been wrong but because she would not forgive boredom for being aspirational. Boredom would have to earn its citizenship back.\n\nMina wrote without writing. She walked and watched and stored sentences in a dry room of her skull. She had stopped reading public letters for two days because she kept wanting to hear her own voice in them and had a superstition about arrogance when the stakes were humiliating. She told him a story about a man in a suit outside a courthouse on a bench that had become a statement in the last decade. He had unfolded a paper with lines and provisions and sub-sections and then, delightfully, had been unable to find the sub-subsection he wanted to wield like a club because the Drawer had taken, for an hour, the route that made legalese move. This was dangerous and probably a sin and she had felt like cheering and then had stopped herself because cheering for a mischief against the law is a good way to recruit not law but chaos. We are sophisticates, she said dryly, and her mouth tasted the disappointment that comes when your own bedside jokes become your work.\n\nHe did not touch the Drawer for a day, because he needed to feel that the city could, as his father had taught him with unsentimental tenderness, self-correct. He watched the practice managers at the clinic put up arrows that circumvented the absent arrows, and he watched an old woman at the grocer write IOU in ancient-efficient script when the card reader refused to remember how numbers are supposed to move through wires, and he watched three children at the corner figure out a new chanting game because the old one had relied on the rhythm of the walkers on their block and that rhythm had been edited by a man sitting in a kitchen across the street, and he punished himself gently with this knowledge and made himself laugh at his own melodrama and then stopped because he had promised the Drawer he would not make laughter a defense. Humor is not armor, his father had once said in the tone of a man who uses humor in precisely the ways he is telling his son not to. Humor is a way to keep doors ajar.\n\nThe Ministry adapted gracefully in public and catastrophically in private. A note arrived in a white envelope with a bird that had been redrawn to look like a strategic device, and inside was a short poem in bureaucratic code that was clearly Creel\u2019s revenge on someone in an office who had sent her to say \u201ccradle\u201d at a door and had then berated her because the door had refused to be impressed. It said that certain levers were intoxications disguised as tasks and that the river moved not merely downward but outward and that her job had become to make sure people did not drown in their own language. He felt an indecent kinship with her, and he refused the feeling, because he would have to refuse much more pleasant feels later and might as well practice on the literate ones.\n\nMarshal Deems came in a crisp coat that compromised with the air only reluctantly. He sat not like a cop with legs thrown wide, he sat like a former friend of his mother who had attended wakes and weddings with a practiced kindness until kindness had been folded into policy, and he held his hat in his hands like a man who cannot be trusted with them when they are empty. You are making it hard to do the wrong thing quickly, he said genial and exhausted, and Evan felt the click of a trap that had been laid with the clean tools of men who thought ethics was a gym. Deems told a story about a floodplain where men had built houses because people always build houses where they would like rivers to be less themselves, and he told it the way his mother had told stories that were really advice: not naming names, not asking for secrets, reporting the weather. They have machines now, Deems said, not threatening and not not-threatening. The Primarch\u2019s engineers call them harmonizers because they have to pun to make themselves bearable. They make holes that want to eat holes. They seal habits. They will try to fit your room into their music. Keep your door closed until you can make them sit down and drink something. It was both a warning and an apology, and neither were sufficient and both would be in the ledger, and Evan nodded in the way men nod when their mouths have become municipal and their hearts remain private apartments inhabited by a few names with toothbrushes.\n\nHe began to notice a cost that was not metaphoric. He reached for the voice of his father saying rude in the British way about some shoddy piece of work, and the route to that voice had a skip in it as if the record had been left in a window and the sun had softened it. On the fourth morning, the face of his father in memory sat three inches to the left of where it had always sat, and that wrongness made him sweat in a way that felt like shame, not fear. He checked himself the way a man checks a tooth that suddenly belongs to a different mouth. He said aloud his father\u2019s full name and the secret name his aunt had once used for him because he had been a romantic in his youth and had laughed at himself for it and had never quite recovered from the embarrassment, and the face slid back into its usual chair and looked at him with a kindness that was impatient with self-pity. The letter with the immaculate-hasty hand anticipated him with infuriating thoroughness. You are moving routes, it said in a paragraph that had been added at the bottom in pencil and then written again with a stylus, which meant someone else in another decade in another room had found the same bruise. Memory is not an object; stop trying to pity it when it is not where you left it. It prefers paths. Give it time. If you find you cannot remember a name that matters, ask a woman in the room and she will remember it for you because women are forced by economies we do not choose to remember the names of things that other people drop. Feed them for this. It was the kind of tender misogyny his father had been capable of when he was tired, and the Drawer corrected the tone with a sentence added in the margin in a hand he did not know: or do not make your forgetting a woman\u2019s job; practice repair yourself.\n\nJune noticed something in her own hand that made her sit at the table and stare at the paper as if it had brought her news of a death. The habit of the capital R had gone on strike. Her wrist refused the flourish. She had to speak to it like a mother speaking to a child who has decided the shirt in the drawer is the wrong blue. She wrote her own name and then wrote her mother\u2019s and then her grandmother\u2019s and then she wrote a word that had kept her grandmother alive in a small town that had wished her dead for a season: respect. The R came back not because she bullied it but because she admitted that its absence had been the consequence of someone else\u2019s disobedience, not hers. She looked at Evan with an expression he had never seen and would remember when the story of the Drawer had been turned into a song and then into a movie and then into the thing you tell children to make them fall asleep. You cannot make routes go away, she said. You can only make them wait. Remember that when you get greedy and call it good.\n\nHe tested the word destroy like a man testing a tool he has learned to pick up without being in love with it. He took a clause in a municipal bulletin that would have made a certain overnight closure of a bridge into a pretext for kettling a hundred people into a tunnel and issuing statements about de-escalation and he unhooked the clause at its adverb. He did not erase. He let the words stand and took the route by which men with batons reached for the sentence without reading the sentence that came before. He felt the room hold back a breath and then let it out, and he heard the street behave itself with a small relief that he could not give himself entirely to because there is nothing more dangerous than a tool that makes good feelings. On the way home he saw the dumb cruelty that follows magic: a boy on a bike took a corner he ought not to have taken because the sign that had trained him had lost its voice for an hour and a tabby cat that had survived three winters in this alley did not survive this one. He stood with the boy and bought him milk and did not teach him anything and then went home and wrote on the old envelope that had become his personal scripture, Do not remove the little moralizing machines unless you have the bandwidth to stand on corner for an hour.\n\nThe Department of Harmony tried a raid and had to pretend afterward that what had happened was a visit to old friends. It was ugly because raids are humiliating to the raiders when they fail, and making a scene requires rhythm and they had none left. They brought a device with a harassed aura and new weld marks, a tube of steel with angry wires that made the air complain, and they set it on the floor of his hall and plugged it in as if they were attaching an IV to the building. The machine made an absence that had been narrated into power. The cabinet did not care. The door refused to coordinate with their silhouette. The men with wires in their ears looked at one another with the mutual pity of technicians asked to solve philosophy with pliers. June told one of them a joke she had learned at the precinct that only made sense in the other language of the city, the one cops used when they had to discuss situation without admitting they were humans, and he laughed reluctantly and then deliberately, and in the middle of his laugh she saw the kid he had been when he had stolen capos from her cousin\u2019s music store because he had wanted to teach himself mandolin and his mother had been tired and he had not been able to ask her for ten dollars. When you give a person a laugh they do not want you write your name on the inside of their throat. She did not want to own this man in that way. She breathed. Kass unplugged the device and stared at it as if it had betrayed her, and Creel said we will try again later with a brighter mind, and Evan said you should try again later on a different problem.\n\nKass waited after the others had removed their politeness from the stairs and told him in a voice she must have borrowed from her grandmother that the Primarch\u2019s people wanted their own Drawer and had built one out of contracts and salary schedules and the language of roads and had succeeded in making a cupboard with no shelves. They think words are objects, she said with something like pain, and you have learned that they are rooms, and they will keep throwing objects into their cabinet until the whole thing collapses and bruises five men you would rather remain unbruised because they are the only men in the room who are teaching their daughters how to carry their own keys. He did not tell her that he had loved a cabinet once, in a museum, a seventeenth-century piece with secret compartments where men had hidden jewels and love poems and drafts of new laws, and that he had cried in the gallery and had had to pretend it had been about the woodwork. He did not tell her that the Drawer had cured him of some old, private griefs that had nothing to do with apes and everything to do with custody. He told her to buy stronger tea and to change nothing about the way she held her cup.\n\nThere was a letter in the Drawer that was not a letter but a palimpsest. Words written in one hand had been washed and written over in another, and both were legible with different species of patience. The first hand had written a map that made sense only if you had lived in a building for ten years and had grown old with its habits: the way the elevator prefers one landing at two in the afternoon, the way a particular pipe hums like a tenor when the tenant above takes his bath, the way the mail slot breathes on windy days, the way the downstairs neighbor puts on her music when her daughter leaves because she cannot bear a quiet whose shape is the outline of a child. The second hand had drawn, on top of that domestic geography, a set of arrows that led downward without leaving, as if the Drawer could become stairs if asked properly and if the stairs could be used without your feet finding out that they were participating. Down, the palimpsest said, is not under. Down is after. To go after, remove the clause everyone agrees on. The sentence feels naked when you do this and will try to put on a different garment. Let it. It will choose something shabbier and more honest. Then open the third letter from the right in the bottom row and read the last word without making a sound. You will think someone has died. You will be wrong. You have no talent for being right in a new room; this is your charm and your doom.\n\nHe treated the letter like arsenic in a Victorian novel and tucked it back with exaggerated care. June saw and pretended only to have seen his hand and not his face, which she had learned not to inventory because it gave her too much jurisdiction. Mina had no idea what the palimpsest said, and she did not ask, and later, when people told the story of Mina\u2019s ethics to students who had grown up two generations past ethics, they would be mystified by the way she had preferred ignorance on purpose. She believed in secrecy the way certain men believe in sports: as a way to mark time.\n\nHe walked with a small, stupid hope to the archive where his father had worked in a life he had refused to visit for months after the funeral. It had become a chic event space in two years and a church in six and then a paper lab in nine, because the city has always been the few oldest things plus the new, and the lab kept hours as arbitrary as the river\u2019s. The young woman at the desk wore an apron with paste kisses on it and spoke like someone who had learned to keep a building alive with careful humidity. He said his father\u2019s name and she did not drop her shoulders; she merely changed her pronouns. She told him how they had learned to deacidify certain atrocities so they could be read without falling apart in the hand, and he taught himself to breathe into his throat, not his chest, to avoid embarrassing himself. She let him handle an old ledger with a list of names that had gotten children milk in a bad year and had gotten their mothers a reputation for being too political at church. He bent over the old ink and let the Drawer in him look for routes he could afford to take and routes he had better teach himself to ignore. He held the ledger and chose not to practice anything at all because the room where people had once drawn routes to themselves to be counted and saved was not his to curate. It belonged to the women whose grocery lists had become history without their time or consent.\n\nIn late afternoon, the Primarch attempted a music that did not end in marching. The band was good, and the crowd had hands, and the steps they made at the end of the melody were not towards any door Evan could take away. He let himself be moved and then forgave himself, because there are only so many rooms you can build in a day and he had discovered a pleasure that did no harm beyond the little private shame of acknowledging the gentleness of a person you are resisting. Thale stood small first and then grew, not in size but in the reach of his voice, and said, We will wait for you in rooms, and Evan had to swallow a cursed laugh, because that was his line. You stole it, he wanted to say. We all steal, the Drawer said in his marrow. Keep your receipts.\n\nThe days acquired a rhythm: remove a path and watch someone learn grace; leave a path and watch someone engineer cruelty; intervene when the habit turned into a cudgel; sit on his hands when a small suffering promised to buy a larger patience; make tea, make notes, make jokes, and then stop joking. He began to mark the city on a private map, routes he had softened and routes he had vowed never to touch. He put hospitals in a firm no and trains in a conditional maybe and the stairs to certain platforms in an absolute you do not meddle here even if a good story would result. He put the municipal building where marriages are recorded in a tender maybe on Thursdays only, because Thursday was a day men like his father make mistakes and women like his mother forgive they have made them.\n\nA letter in a foul mood arrived around midnight one night and chastised him in a voice that might have been Eider\u2019s or might have been the Drawer\u2019s disappointment at being used like a broom. You will be asked to remove clauses from laws, it said. You are not a miracle. If you remove the \u201cexcept in cases\u201d you will make a door that only bad men will know how to use because good men find doors embarrassing. You may remove routes from men in rooms with microphones. You may remove routes from stages. If you remove a clause from the law you will become a story about a monster told to children and you will have to write your own bedtime story for the rest of your life to sleep. It was a harshness he recognized. He had always wanted to be spoken to in the cold. His father had failed him by loving him too much, and this letter corrected the balance five degrees toward the sane.\n\nHe tried a thing that made him blush. He took the ring closure away from a police line for an hour and watched, through slotted shutters like a person who knows better than to indulge his taste for theater, as a crowd that had been designed to be kettled found itself in an accidental spiral and unspooled into strange alleys and sang songs not on the approved list and wrote in chalk on the backs of their own hands because the sidewalks were being washed by polite men with unpleasant vans. The line of cops looked at one another and then at the sergeant and then the sergeant looked at the sky and the sky looked back and said nothing, and afterward, on the news that is not news, people argued that it had been rehearsed and people argued that it had been an angel and people argued that it had been luck and no one said Cabinet except a woman in a back room who would be fired in a week for reasons that could be summarized as Not Understanding Her Job. He did not tell anyone he had made a tiny correction to a metal barricade by thinking at it with love. He did not boast. He had learned at last the taste of not telling a thing even to the person who sleeps on your couch when she has had a night, and the taste was apple pit and humility and he could not tell whether he liked it.\n\nHe found himself wanting to write the name again into the wood to feel the room bow. He did not. He wrote instead a list of places in the apartment where he would allow the Drawer to be fully itself without his mediation. He wrote, on the envelope near his father\u2019s watch, Leave the hall mirror alone because June uses it to argue with her face and if you take that route from her she will learn to get her dignity from a worse commodity. Leave the window latch alone because Mina sings to it and the latch has learned the song. Leave the radiator alone because the tics are the only clock we will keep when the others become famous for lying. He signed it with his name because he was practicing cooperation with himself. He placed the envelope under the letters, not as a directive but as a bargain.\n\nA child outside wrote NOW under the NOT YET and then, after a moment, drew a careful line through the ON and wrote AND above them in block capitals. The sidewalk taught grammar to the day. WE WILL AND NOT YET, the banner said, repaired with tape that had been made in a factory where a woman with small hands had learned to hate her manager and forgive him because he had a child who would not sleep and she had once had a child who had died and she wanted, against reason, to give him this one unearned mercy. Evan walked to the corner with his Elsewhere basket and bought onions because Kass had promised to come and borrow the kettle as a civilian and not as a harmonist, and he felt like a man shopping at the last market in a city that has outlawed markets for their subversive insistence on person-to-person debt.\n\nHe opened the Drawer at dusk with the quiet ceremony of someone folding a flag and took out a letter he had not yet dared to touch. The pale blue of it made the room look like his mother\u2019s last dress, and the stamp\u2019s absence of glue was suddenly a tenderness, a proof that no seal had been forced, that the letter had always been intended to be opened and closed with human fingers, not by machine. The hand was the lazy-immaculate one, the one that teased and refused and loved. It told him about a woman who had owned a shop by the river where men bought ribbon to tie things they had not the vocabulary to hold. It told him she had built a secret Drawer of her own with her ledger and her ink, and that when men came to take what she had she had removed, for a week, the route by which bows become knots and the city had had to learn intimacy without ligatures. He laughed, he cried, he looked for someone to share the image with and found himself unwilling to ruin it by making it public. He put the letter back and said his father\u2019s name to the wood. The apartment hummed with the sound of a building addressed for the first time by its owner by its proper title. The Drawer did not rattle. It slept like a cat on a warm machine.\n\nAt the end of that week, with the city in a new genus of confusion that had not yet learned to bite, with the songs they had learned to sing during seasons of choreographed marching refusing to fit the new tempo, with the Primarch performing a humility that made him the most dangerous kind of king, with the Ministry buying fruit in bulk and wondering why the city laughed when it saw oranges, Evan wrote a sentence in his own hand on paper that had been part of his father\u2019s life and folded it into the Drawer where it could be found later by someone whose patience he was trying on like a borrowed shirt. The sentence said, Leave the chairs empty as long as you can. When you cannot, seat bodies in them who will fall asleep and drool and wake embarrassed and ask for water. Do not put objects in chairs. Do not put levers in chairs. Do not sit in the chair you made until someone else tells you to. Then pretend you do not like chairs. Then tell the truth, but not to the room, to the door.\n\nHe did not expect an answer. He received none. He boiled water and watched the kettle fog the window in a square that explained, better than any letter, why a room is better than a wheel. He did not feel holy. He felt practical. He was tired. Mina snored on the couch into a pillow that had actually belonged to a chair and was now experimenting with being something else. June\u2019s pencil had dulled and she had, without ceremony, accepted a bright blue pen with a bad slogan from a pharmacy that no longer believed it could afford to be ethical in public. Kass\u2019s knock came at the appointed noise; the kettle performed; the drawer breathed; and the city did the only honest thing it knows how to do when it has been offered a new technology in a decade that claims to have outgrown technology, which is to say: it practiced.",

                              "content": "On the morning the last post arrived, a motorcade of black cars threaded down First Avenue and left a smell like wet copper and banana peels. The city had learned not to watch, but windows fluttered anyway. The people had learned not to speak, but a word trembled in the throat of the city and touched every dental filling. Evan Saye listened to it thrum through the radiator and into the desk where he sat trying to finish a simple form, a requisition for archival boxes, a job made impossible by the tremor of his name threaded all through a letter he would not read.\n\nHe had a drawer that stuck on humid days. He had a drawer that he had measured once, nervously amused by its exact width: the span of his father's hand from thumb to little finger, splayed. He had a drawer that contained twenty-seven letters, all written by a person who didn't exist, dated from years that had not yet happened, addressed to a house he had not yet inherited. The drawer was a minor character in the apartment\u2014old wood, the color of burned tea\u2014and it had a way of being louder than it should be. When the motorcade passed, when the hum touched the copper pipes, the drawer rattled once. Short. Rude. A cough from a sick child in a library.\n\n\u201cYou hear it?\u201d Mina asked from the doorway without stepping into the room, which had always been his room and not anyone else's room, even when she slept on the futon and made jokes about the fan growling like an injured bear. She still folded herself into liminal spaces; she had a reporter's posture, feet ready to retreat.\n\n\u201cI hear it,\u201d he said.\n\nMina looked older in the gray light. Not older than she was, just older than she had been the last time he saw her. She had a scarf and the scarf had feathers printed on it. Feathers felt dangerous now. Feathers meant you were remembering birds in a time when their absence was a daily headline, always down below the fold, because other stories bit first.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re changing the guard,\u201d Mina said, pushing her voice low, conspiratorial, although everything conspiratorial had been dragged into daylight and given press conferences. \u201cThe signet car is here. He\u2019s going to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cPrimarch Thale.\u201d\n\nEvan\u2019s mouth went dry. Thale was the ape you could recognize even in words, even without a photograph: sentences like knuckleprints, shipments of declaratives. The late-night shows had tried to mock his cadence and failed. You couldn\u2019t parody gravity.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll go to the Dome,\u201d Mina said, \u201cand he\u2019ll do that thing where he makes himself small first. They always do that. They claim the human gesture before they grow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d Evan said, and he didn\u2019t know why he said it. It meant nothing. It meant the opposite of what it meant. It meant something that he had not allowed into daylight, something his father\u2019s letters had hinted at without quite writing down.\n\nMina moved to the window. \u201cYou could come,\u201d she said, the way she had said it three times a week for the last three months. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide forever. It\u2019s just a speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hiding.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not coming to see them. You\u2019re not doing your work. You\u2019re not seeing anyone but me and June, and June is on call half the week. You tell me what that is if not hiding.\u201d\n\nHe had learned to be careful with his voice, to keep it slow and soft. He chose silence\u2014his stupid new trick\u2014and turned toward the rattling drawer. It rattled again as if prompted by his attention. He placed his palm on it. He told himself he felt nothing. He told himself he felt a coolness like a winter coin. Both were true. That's not even how physics works, you said? Well.\n\n\u201cI brought pastries,\u201d Mina added, and swung a paper bag into the air. It had a grease stain in the shape of the continent the schoolchildren called The Lost Country on their contraband maps, the maps that still included glaciers drawn like sleeping dogs. \u201cIf you don't eat I\u2019ll tell June.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always tell June.\u201d\n\nMina turned from the window, but her gaze snagged on the drawer, because it had a way of snagging gazes. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d Too quick. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to open it, Evan. I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d\n\nHe hadn\u2019t thought she was stupid. He had thought she was braver than he was, and braver than that again, and she had amulets against her own bravery: her little jokes, her scarf, the way she kept stepping back from thresholds. He had thought that if he asked her to leave, she would know something dangerous, and if he asked her to stay, she would know something dangerous, and this is what choice feels like.\n\n\u201cYou never told me,\u201d Mina said. She balanced the paper bag on the arm of the chair, like a juggler finishing her act. \u201cNot what he wrote, not really.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wrote everything,\u201d Evan said, surprised by the accuracy of the words as they left him. He realized he had been wanting to say exactly that since his father\u2019s funeral, when the sky had been white and hot like bone. \u201cHe wrote more than everything. He wrote through it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThrough what?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world,\u201d he said, and then had to laugh, because the way he said it sounded like someone else, sounded ridiculous and pretentious and a little like the university professor he had once wanted to be. Mina smiled without humor.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re going to eat croissants,\u201d she said, \u201cand then the Primarch will speak.\u201d\n\nEvan loved that she could paste a day together like that matter-of-factly. He went to the kitchen and filled the kettle. He listened to the water shape the kettle tin. When he opened the drawer with the tea bags it stuck, not like the letter drawer but with its ordinary bad fit. He let it stick. He watched his hands making tea and thought of them as other people\u2019s hands, or the hands of a small boy who had been taught to be careful with boiling water. Once, he had had strong opinions about the correct way to make tea. He had opinions about whether the kettle should be metal or ceramic or early plastic. There was a comfort in that pettiness he could not find now.\n\nWhen he came back, Mina had guessed. He knew she had guessed because she had not looked at the drawer directly; she had given it the respectful inattention we reserve for sleeping dogs and unexploded shells. She had unwrapped the pastries and put them on a plate. She had turned on the radio. It ate the room with its comfortable voices, made the apartment seem like a normal apartment with a normal radio at nine-thirty in the morning. The music was borrowed from the old days, strings recorded in a hall half the width of the sea.\n\nThe announcer said the words. \u201cPrimarch Thale will now address the demonstrators gathered at the Dome. The Primarch is accompanied by Minister of Harmony Luwena Creel and the Human Envoy, Marshal Deems.\u201d\n\nThe last name was a mouthful of ash. Mina\u2019s eyes flicked to Evan and away. Marshal Deems had been his mother\u2019s friend, in another life, before the Departments were merged and the animal study programs rerouted and renamings happened like small earthquakes. Marshal in this case meant no armies, meant a collar and a medal in the shape of a fig leaf.\n\nThey listened to footsteps. A murmur rose like smoke and was cut clean in the middle as if edited. Thale\u2019s voice began where human voices end; it had a bass note that you couldn't play with instruments, only with the body.\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d Thale said, and paused, as if tasting the syllables. \u201cAnd not-people. Today is the day we say the same thing. We are present. We are present. We are present.\u201d\n\nMina made a face that said both ugh and wow, which is not an easy face to make. Evan put his hand on the letter drawer again. It was warm this time. He pulled it open a finger\u2019s width and let the smell come out. Old paper is vanilla, decay and sun and glue. These letters did not smell like that. They smelled like snow and something else: the bitter bite of the first peel of an orange.\n\nThale continued. \u201cYour maps are ours. Your water is ours. Your cities are ours. And your stories\u2014oh, your stories\u2014were never yours alone. We have been in your government from the beginning. We were at your first votes and your last. We were the quiet ones who carried the boxes and watched the counters. We counted, and we waited, and we have come to claim our place. Not as invaders. As residents.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolite, isn\u2019t he,\u201d Mina said to the air, because if she had directed the comment to Evan, it would have been too dangerous.\n\n\u201cI remember when they were funny,\u201d Evan said before he could help himself. \u201cRemember? The day they filmed Primarch Tallo trying on a tie and getting it around his head like a visor?\u201d He winced. He could hear it: the warm, nostalgic cadence of someone remembering a harmless television clip from a gentler time. There had been no gentle time. The clip had been an insertion. We had been coaxed.\n\n\u201cYou can admit it was funny,\u201d Mina said. \u201cI mean, it was. It doesn\u2019t change\u2014what you just said.\u201d\n\nThale was speaking again. \u201cWe are much the same. We love our young. We are tired when the day is done. We share fruit. We tell stories in the long dark. We have learned your contracts and your customs. We have signed our names in your blue ink. We have watched you err and err and err, and we do not find you intolerable.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice,\u201d Mina said. \u201cNice of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he practiced that line a lot,\u201d Evan said.\n\n\u201cMarshal Deems will now say something,\u201d the announcer whispered as if gossiping in class. \u201cHe will assure us of cooperation across\u2014\u201d\n\nEvan turned the radio off. The sudden silence made him sway. Mina did not object. They ate, an act that always felt a little intimate now in a city where food had turned into a calculation: where had it come from, who grew it, who did not get to eat because you did. The croissants flaked pleasantly, a simple pleasure imported diagonally.\n\n\u201cWhen did they start calling it the Ministry of Harmony?\u201d Mina asked.\n\n\u201cWhen the Ministry of Decorum got renamed,\u201d Evan said. \u201cWhen the Ministry of Order ate the Department of Compliance. When the Department of Records got folded into\u2014you know what, never mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father would tell you not to stop the sentence halfway.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father would tell me to burn the sentence,\u201d Evan said. He opened the drawer in full.\n\nThe letters lay in their sleeps, bound with a string that had long since cut into them like a scar. Twenty-seven. White, cream, and one pale blue. He had counted them so many times he knew their thickness by weight. He had not read them all. He had read one. One had read him. He could not\u2014there was a phrase his father used to use, pedagogical and patient\u2014he could not yet afford the other knowledge. There it was: the voice he had avoided choking on all morning. The voice of a father who was dead and not quiet about it.\n\nMina did not reach. She put the tips of her fingers on the table and touched the wood, touching the letters by proximity. She had offered, weeks ago, to take them for him, to put them somewhere safe, as if such a place still existed. He had nearly said yes. He had said no. He had made them both complicit.\n\n\u201cDoes June know?\u201d she asked. \u201cThat they\u2019re here?\u201d\n\n\u201cJune knows not to ask,\u201d he said. \u201cJune knows to bring a warrant.\u201d\n\n\u201cJune would never bring a warrant.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is a detective,\u201d he said. \u201cThey taught her that the state is a river. If she is a fish she swims.\u201d\n\nMina said nothing. It was not kind, what he had said, and she was leaving it with him so he could see it.\n\nHe took the letter at the top of the bundle and slid it free. Its envelope had never been sealed; it had the absence of glue you see sometimes in old stock or in items made for practice. The paper inside was thin, almost onion, the kind the government liked in the twentieth century before the climate corners were cut. His father's hand was not on it. His father's hand was never on it. The script was precise and lazy at once, a hand that knew it would be read by eyes that loved it.\n\nHe did not read. He let his eyes move, a child's trick for avoiding the text while stealing its shape. He saw the name. It said Dear Evan in a way that suggested he was younger. It said Dear Ev. One letter had said Dear E. Once, in a way that had made him sit down suddenly, Dear Creature.\n\nMina watched his face like you watch a weatherperson\u2019s face when the radar is going red-red-red. She had always tried to be a reader of faces; she had told a story once at dinner about the first time she knew her mother had lied to her, a story involving a rabbit and a scarf and an empty pantry. He placed the letter on the table and put his index finger on the final paragraph. It was not an index. It was his finger. He had been thinking in catalogue terms, in finding aids and box lists. Old habits like barnacles.\n\n\u201cThis one,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the one with the description.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf the drawer. Of the city. Of today.\u201d He said it like a joke, but the air buckled around the words.\n\n\u201cYou told me there was a letter like that,\u201d she said. \u201cI sort of didn\u2019t believe you, if I am being honest. Are you reading it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d he said. \u201cYou should go.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a drunk,\u201d he said, immediately ashamed. He\u2019s not a drunk, she had said once to their aunt, when their aunt had fretted that he had called her three nights in a row and said nothing. She had said it with a graze of humor so soft it could almost be love.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019re not,\u201d she said, as if she were saying it again to the aunt. \u201cI just want to be here. I just want to be a person you can tell, later, that I was here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think something is going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOf course I do.\u201d\n\nHe read. He read with the peculiar greed he had when the letters aligned with the day, a floating greed, a greed with clean hands. He read the first sentence twice and then three times and then out loud, because reading out loud changed it, it made the words heavier and made it impossible for the mind to slip its leash and run off like a dog after an imaginary rabbit.\n\nThe letter said:\n\nToday, at nine thirty-one, you will hear your name spoken on the radio and not spoken, and you will turn the radio off, and you will open the drawer.\n\nHe did not say, Mina. He did not say Look. He was not going to perform. He read on.\n\nYou will read this sentence. You will like the line about the radio. You will think it is clever. It is not clever. It is a wire. It is a fence post. It is a way of saying: you will do the things you have already done. You will be tired. The city will be gray. Outside, the motorcade is moving. You are already in the hard part. You will want someone to tell you that it is not the hard part. I am not going to be that person.\n\nI'm sorry for the handwriting, the letter said in the next line, and it looked like a joke because the handwriting was immaculate, but it was not a joke. The apology was for the apology.\n\nHe skipped. He made himself go back. The letter had rules like that. If you skipped, you lost the shape. You lost the thread.\n\nThe letter said:\n\nThe Ministry of Harmony will visit you. They will be polite and they will ask you if you have seen a thing that contains something. They will not say the words drawer or letter. They will hold their hands flat like plates. They will bring fruit. You will think of this as a joke and you will tell Mina. You will tell her the fruit is a sign. It is not a sign. It is fruit.\n\n\u201cIs this the one that tells you\u2014\u201d Mina began, and then stopped, because she did not want to be in the sentence, in the wire.\n\nHe did not answer. He reached the part he always reached in these letters, the kink where prophecy turned into architecture. He could feel it before he saw it in ink. The way the ink changed, just a little heavier as if the pen had been dipped again. He read the paragraph that made his heart speed and his jaw hurt.\n\nIt said:\n\nThere is going to be a way to stop them. Humans love a way like an animal loves a bone. You think the way is a lever. You think you pull and the wall falls and there is light, hallelujah. It is not like that. The way is a drawer. The way is a place you should not open, a box you kept because your father told you to keep it, because once he told you to burn a letter and you did not, you couldn't, because the fire on that particular night looked too theatrical and you have always hated theater. The way is made of things people wrote with their hands. The way is old love, and accounts, and receipts, and the very boring notice your mother kept from a laundry about how the washing machines would be out of service from the twelfth to the fourteenth. The way is this letter. I am not trying to be mystical. It is mechanics. It is gears. I can explain later. Later is complicated.\n\nHe put his hand over the paragraph and felt his face become the face of a person hiding in a movie. Mina had learned to be quiet when he pressed his palm to ink like that. She stood up without sound. She brought him water. She put it within reach so he did not have to move through the space between his chair and the glass.\n\nHe read the rest. He did not intend to read the rest\u2014they say good intentions don't matter, but they do; they matter because you measure how far you are from them, you measure the gap and you call the gap guilt\u2014but he read. The letter described a sequence of foldings, exactly three, not one more. It said that if he folded one letter in thirds\u2014not this one, the one with the pale blue paper\u2014and slid it along the tongue of the drawer, he would hear a click like a bead. It said that if he tore the red stamp from the envelope with the missing glue and chewed it (Don't swallow, the letter said, as if writing to a child, as if it knew he would laugh and gag simultaneously) he would say a name in his head and someone would answer. It said that if he did both, and then read the name of the person who wrote the very last letter, the one at the bottom, out loud into the drawer, there would be a light that was not light and then he would understand how destroy is not a violent verb but an emptiness verb, a word meaning to un-make space.\n\nHe stopped. He closed his eyes. His mouth was dry, his tongue a stick.\n\n\u201cYou look like you\u2019re about to faint,\u201d Mina said. \u201cYou don\u2019t faint, do you? Tell me you\u2019re not a fainter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. He heard the word as if spoken by someone else. A poor actor. A man in a play wearing a tie all wrong.\n\n\u201cThat's a lot of face paleness for 'fine,'\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me to call June?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. He did want June. He wanted her steadiness and her early-cop habit of writing everything down in a notebook, even now when the city had networked her to the point where notebooks were considered anachronistic and suspicious. He wanted exactly the sound of her pen scratching when he said something unbelievable. He wanted her to say, Okay, and then to say, Start again.\n\nThe buzzer buzzed. It was anticlimax and catastrophe at once. The sound was neither polite nor rude. It had been the same buzzer since the building was erected, a decade when people still believed in good materials. Mina went to the intercom and did not press talk. She flattened her hand on the wall above it. She did not need to ask him who it would be. This, too, was in the letter. He did not need to ask if he should answer. They had already done it in one version of the day. They were doing it again. They were trapped in the etiquette of time.\n\nHe pressed talk. The voice came up from the vestibule with a small city of static built around it.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Mr. Saye,\u201d it said. \u201cWe see that you are listening to the news. We hear the music. Please open the door.\u201d\n\nEvan had a habit, the habit of normal people: when confronted with the abnormal, imitate calm. He pressed the door and buzzed them in. He stood in the kitchen. He wondered if he was supposed to hide the letters. He did not move toward them, as if motion itself would draw a line from the drawer to his hand. Mina stood in the doorway like a guard in a Renaissance painting. Automatically, she smoothed her scarf.\n\nThey arrived not like police, who bang and bang again, but like polite relatives. Two women, both wearing clothing meant to be interpreted as neutral, the way clouds are meant to be interpreted as neutral even when the storm is inside them. One had dark hair in a coil at the nape. She carried a metal case. The other wore glasses without lenses. Her suit had been cut for someone else\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cWe are Harmony,\u201d the woman with the glasses said, proving the letter. \u201cLuwena Creel, Minister, and this is Kass. May we enter?\u201d\n\nEvan said yes because no had stopped being part of the vocabulary. He looked at their hands. Kass, the one with the case, had a small scar across her knuckles. He realized he was always looking at hands now. He remembered his father's, moving when he spoke even when they were empty, spelling invisible words in the air.\n\nMina fetched two chairs and set them opposite the table. She did not introduce herself. She pulled the scarf tighter and looked like a student who had not done the reading and was going to be so careful she would become part of the wallpaper. Creel smiled at her and set the smile down as if it had weight.\n\n\u201cMr. Saye,\u201d Creel said. \u201cWe have been following your work.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou and everyone,\u201d Mina murmured.\n\n\u201cOur work is to follow,\u201d Creel replied as if she had been allowed to hear the words, as if this were a play with careful staging. Her eyes were hazel and had a black rim like a ring of coal. \u201cYour father also was a man whose work we followed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sent a wreath,\u201d Evan said. It came out like an accusation. \u201cIt had\u2014figs.\u201d\n\n\u201cFigs are a symbol of fraternity,\u201d Creel said smoothly. \u201cThe Greeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe apes,\u201d Mina said very softly. She was not supposed to say it; the words were being gently discouraged now as if they were slurs. Creel pretended she had not heard, and by pretending, made the word tremble like the tight line of a highwire.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to ask some questions,\u201d Kass said, her first words in a voice that had gravel in it. \u201cWe\u2019re going to ask about boxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoxes?\u201d Evan said. He put his hand on the table as if he were going to stand and then realized he was already standing. He sat. He did not touch the drawer. He thought of the drawer as a mouth.\n\n\u201cBoxes,\u201d Creel repeated. \u201cContainers. We have a list of items survived from the pre-Integration period that are categorized as heuristics. Assemblies. Your father oversaw some of them. We need to take an inventory.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here to take my father\u2019s things,\u201d he said. They were not his father\u2019s things. They had been his father\u2019s for a while and then his father\u2019s hands had stopped moving and the things had become the things of the state again, the state that was a river, the river that had new fish.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to recognize them,\u201d Creel said. \u201cThe word is recognize.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want something to drink?\u201d Mina blurted, and actually stood up as if she might go and get them water. Creel\u2019s smile changed a fraction. The fraction contained the word Good.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Creel said. \u201cIf we may ask: you received a letter last week.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Evan said, because if the letter knew this, they would know too. \u201cA form letter about the volunteer registry. I discarded it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI receive a lot of mail,\u201d he lied, badly.\n\n\u201cThe other letter,\u201d she said again, and this time she turned her head, and he saw the light catch the lenses that weren't there. It hurt his eyes. He looked at Kass and saw what Kass was looking at: the corner of the envelope lying innocently under the string, the pale blue one. There was no way she could have seen it; he had not moved anything, the drawer was barely open. He felt a heat of unreasonable anger. He wanted to slap the drawer and shout at it as if it were a dog that had done something wrong. It had not. He had. He had opened it while the city was full of motorcades and speeches. He had let the smell out.\n\n\u201cThe volunteer registry letter,\u201d Mina cut in, with a reporter\u2019s skill for re-suturing a conversation. \u201cHe got it. Everyone on this block got it. It\u2019s not special. Do you want me to show you mine?\u201d\n\nCreel did not look at her. \u201cMr. Saye,\u201d she said, \u201cyou understand that we ask for these things not to take them away, but to keep them safe for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you told my father,\u201d he said, and he had not intended to say it but there it was, the sentence on the table between them like a knife. \u201cAnd then you took him somewhere and he didn\u2019t come home for four days. And when he came home he said it was fine. And then he wrote me that letter six months before he died, telling me to keep the drawer closed\u2014\u201d He cut himself. It was too much, and he had said the thing he was not supposed to say. He had said the drawer out loud.\n\nMina made a small animal sound. Kass\u2019s eyes shifted; you could almost hear the lens aperture moving. Creel did not change expression. Only her hands changed, the fingers of both hands coming together as if in prayer, not touching, just hovering in the shape of a prayer. She had good hands for television.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to ask you,\u201d Creel said calmly, \u201cto come with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you have a warrant?\u201d Mina asked before Evan could say anything at all, good or bad. It was a question that had to be asked like a ritual in a religion where God has stopped answering and the ritual is how you keep your humaneness.\n\n\u201cWe have a note,\u201d Creel said. She derived the words from their smallest parts. \u201cA white note. A note that is white.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you speak like this because you think he is stupid?\u201d Mina asked. Her voice shaking now, the scarf too tight.\n\n\u201cI speak like this because we have been instructed,\u201d Creel said. She put the note on the table. It was actual paper, a novelty now. It had a stamp with a bird that no longer existed. The stamp might have been a taunt. The note had no letterhead. The letters on it were letters like they had taught third-graders to make in a lost decade. He could not help reading it.\n\nIt said:\n\nWhen you receive this, it will be time. Please bring the man in question. Please bring his letters in their case. Do not open them. Do not let him open them. Say the word cradle if anyone asks you about warrants. If anyone says drawer, smile. This is delicate. The name is Eider.\n\nThe name bit him. He did not make a sound, but he felt the bite. The word Eider had appeared once before, in a letter that had made him cold in August. He had thought, because he was human, of a duck, of down, of the softest wing. He had later looked up the etymology and laughed at himself. He had read that it also meant something else in another tongue, something that was not actually a translation so much as an invitation. He had closed the book.\n\nEvan looked up and saw that Creel had understood. That had been the point of saying the name out loud: to make him look up. He would have looked up anyway.\n\n\u201cI will come,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina said. \u201cThis is insane. You know where this leads.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt leads to a room,\u201d Kass said, her voice unexpectedly gentle. \u201cA room with a table and chairs. Air conditioning. There is nothing in the room. We will speak. Later, there will be coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou make it sound so nice,\u201d Mina said, tears in her voice now, and Evan hated himself for liking her anger, for finding it reassuring. Her anger meant the world was still wired.\n\nHe stood. He reached for his jacket. He did not look at the drawer one last time because that would have made him the man in a movie with the wrong tie. He did not look at Mina because if he saw her face he might sit down and become the man who does not leave and then the letter would be wrong and he did not know what would happen then. He did not believe the letter was right because he was not a child. He believed in something messier: the way the world rolls downhill.\n\nAt the door, Creel touched his arm. Her hand was cool, dry. Her palm had a ridge of callus like a guitar player\u2019s. He filed this away. Suddenly, he remembered something his father had said when Evan was fourteen and the world was full of teachers who did not matter to him in the least. His father had said, Watch how people hold small things. It will tell you what they will do with large things. At the time it had seemed foppish, like advice about cravats. He thought about the callus. He thought about the way she had placed the note on the table, the gentleness of it. He thought about fruit.\n\nThe elevator had a mirror, and it gave him back a face he did not like. He had grown a beard because he had not shaved on a morning when it mattered, and then it became easier to keep not shaving. He had become the sort of man who looked like he had thoughts in an attic. He had become the sort of man whose opinions about tea mattered to him more than the news. He leaned his head against the cool mirror and closed his eyes. He remembered a photograph from an exhibit of early apes: a silverback in a suit, sitting on a stool with a banana balanced on the palm of his hand like a joke, like a crown.\n\nThey took him in the polite car. The city went by like a film about the city, the way you see your street and see it as if it had been made for a movie. He noticed banners he had not noticed. The banners were a kind of grammar, small declaratives: WE SHARE. WE ARE HERE. WE ARE ORDER. Slogans like the old ones, but with the pronouns shifted one seat left. He saw June at a crosswalk in her black coat with the ripped lining and an umbrella that refused to open all the way. She did not see him. He almost banged on the window. He almost did a dozen things that he did not do.\n\nThe building they took him to had not been its building before. It had been a bank, then a data center, then a school, then nothing, and now it was this, a place where rooms had been redefined. The city had better metaphors but had lost the habit of using them. Aren\u2019t we clever, we used to say when we made a church a restaurant, a warehouse a loft. Now we said nothing. We were shells in shells.\n\nThey put him in a room that had nothing in it, exactly as advertised. A table. Chairs. An air conditioner that hummed like the radio. He sat and thought about saying, Cradle, and laughed a little because the word was ridiculous in his mouth. Creel and Kass made a show of leaving him alone. He did not think the room had ears. He thought the room was a mouth.\n\nHe waited. He had planned to be brave. He had planned to be polite and then not-polite and then brave. He had planned to say, I want my lawyer, and then he remembered he did not have a lawyer, not the way one has a lawyer in movies. He thought of the letter: a sequence of folds, a tear, a name. He thought of the tiny ritual that would unmake a lump of time into something else. He thought of the way the word destroy had felt in his mouth when he had said it once in therapy, in an office where a woman with a sharp bob had given him permission to think about the worst. He thought of the word as a tool, as a spoon. He kept thinking of spoons for weeks afterward. He saw them everywhere. He did not tell anyone because he did not want to know if it meant anything.\n\nThey brought him coffee. The coffee tasted like coffee. It was too hot. Kass sat, and Creel did not sit. She leaned against the wall and folded her arms and then unfolded them. She looked like a person doing a good impression of a friend.\n\n\u201cWe're not your enemies,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause then I would have too many.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re very literary. June says the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cJune knows you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all here. The river.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here for the drawer,\u201d he said. He couldn't stop himself from saying it. The word had a fanged sweetness now, a dessert that made his mouth bleed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for you,\u201d Creel said smoothly.\n\n\u201cWhich is the same thing.\u201d\n\nKass put the cup on the table in such a careful way that he wanted to take it and throw it. \u201cWe think your father was involved in a program you have not been briefed on,\u201d she began. \u201cWe think it involved the management of legacy texts.\u201d\n\n\u201cLegacy texts,\u201d he repeated. \u201cYou mean letters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe mean letters,\u201d she conceded.\n\n\u201cAnd why? Why do you care about a drawer of paper that old ladies in libraries would not catalog because the acid content is wrecking them? Why do you care about letters that smell like snow? Why do you want something that can\u2019t be digitized?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause there was a program,\u201d Creel said. \u201cBecause words were a technology. Because your father believed in lever-points. Because we were late to that belief, and we are not late anymore. Because, Mr. Saye, you know this already or you would not have opened the drawer when the motorcade passed. You know you are not a victim. You know you are one of the authors.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. It had no humor in it. \u201cYou have been reading my mail.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been reading the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes your mail is in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me what it does,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, don\u2019t you? Don\u2019t lie. Tell me what it does.\u201d\n\nCreel looked to Kass, and there was a flicker there that made him glad he had asked. He had been right. There were tears underneath her professionalism. There was something like respect under Kass\u2019s gravel.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d Kass said. \u201cWe have theories.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always have theories,\u201d Creel added, half a joke, making Kass sound like the voice of caution she probably was. \u201cWe know it is a bundle. We know the letters are tuned. We know certain words make certain doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoors where?\u201d he asked, and he felt like a child at a menagerie asking for a tiger. \u201cWhere do they lead?\u201d\n\n\u201cDown,\u201d Creel said. She used the word with no emphasis and so it carried all the emphasis in the world.\n\n\u201cThe old trick,\u201d he said. \u201cWe go down to go up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe correct the error,\u201d she said. It was not clear whose error, when it had been made. \u201cIt is a safe program when done correctly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if done incorrectly?\u201d He had to keep asking the obvious questions. It made him feel like himself.\n\nKass touched her scar absently. \u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cYour father asked for you. He asked that if we could not contain the drawer\u2014we hate that word\u2014if we could not contain the letters, we should bring you in and tell you half of the story and see if the other half would show itself. He said you were the only one who could read the handwriting that is not on the page.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's a very sweet line that you have prepared,\u201d he said. \u201cDid he dictate that one? Or did you write it?\u201d\n\nKass smiled. \u201cHalf that line is mine,\u201d she said. \u201cI like it.\u201d\n\nHe sat with his hands on his knees and thought about not saying anything at all, because not saying anything at all had become a sort of theology for him. He had a religion of silence now, a religion that did not help anyone and did not change the world and did not move the brutes of history one inch. He was aware of the brutes, the way they move slow, the way we hang banners on them as if that would make their feet lighter. He was aware of his own smallness, a person in a room with coffee and a letter in his pocket, pretending that one action of his could move anything larger than a kettle to boil.\n\nHe said, \u201cWho is Eider?\u201d\n\nKass and Creel both stilled. It was such a petty thing, the stillness. The room became a photograph. He watched them become sculpture, and then watched them become people again, and it made him feel like he had turned the world off and on.\n\nCreel lowered her eyes. \u201cYour father\u2019s colleague,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know this.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I?\u201d\n\n\u201cEider was a name assigned to the program. People took it as their sobriquet. It meant\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cA duck,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t add anything else. He liked having the last word for once even if it was stupid.\n\n\u201cWe have followed a map,\u201d Creel went on, a little flustered now, and the tiny mess she made of the sentence brought him a strange relief. \u201cWe have our program. We need your cooperation. We need you to bring the letters out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cAnd then,\u201d she said, speaking cleanly again. \u201cWe do not force you. We are asking.\u201d\n\nHe understood something then that felt like a knot loosening and then tightening again. He could say no, and they would not force him today. They would only ask again tomorrow. They would be polite until politeness wore him away like a river. He suddenly wanted to be unpolite on purpose, to become something it would hurt them to tame. He did not know how to be that person.\n\n\u201cI will bring you one,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the good one. A letter that is not a key. A letter that will teach you nothing.\u201d He said this defiantly, and then felt the ridiculousness of the defiance. Eyebrows raised in pity.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Kass said evenly. \u201cWe will learn what we can from the wrong letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Mina had slipped into the room without his hearing the door. He looked at her, surprised, and she looked back with a face he had never seen on her. She had borrowed someone else's expression, a woman from a painting, a woman who had had to live through something worse than jokes on television. \u201cWhy are you helping them?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not helping them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou are bringing them the thing they do not know how to name.\u201d\n\nHe folded his hands into their negative. He wanted to tell her that there were worse fates than helping, and one of them was letting someone else do it. He did not say it. He said nothing, because he is so good at that.\n\nOn the way home, the motorcade had changed its smell. It smelled like oil alone now, the bananas gone. It felt like an omen, and because it felt like an omen he refused to name it. He went up the stairs and not in the elevator. He counted the steps, childish, and lost count twice and started again. In the kitchen, he washed his hands.\n\nHe took out the pale blue letter. He folded it in thirds. He slid it along the tongue of the drawer. He did not chew the stamp, because it made him laugh to think of it and he could not bear laughter in the room with the letters. He put the blue folded thing in place and heard, yes, a click like a bead struck with a fingernail.\n\nHe waited then, because you wait when you have heard a click even if you think it means nothing. He closed the drawer. He opened it again because that is a reflex. Nothing had changed. The envelopes lay like creatures pretending not to be creatures. The bottom-most one had its corner frayed in that way that made him think it had rubbed against a pocket of a coat in a place where a life had been lived that was not his. He did not reach for it. He had told Creel that he would bring them the wrong letter and he planned to keep his wrong promise.\n\nThe next morning, he would take the second letter from the top, the one his father had once called \u201cthe bread letter\u201d in a moment of joking that had not been his style. He would wrap it in brown paper and tuck it into an envelope from the Department of Records with a sticky note that said nothing useful. He would walk it across the city in a canvas bag like any other literate person with errands. He would hand it over and they would smile at him as if he had carried someone\u2019s baby and he would hate them for being polite and new.\n\nThat would be tomorrow. Tonight was long and was going to be longer.\n\nMina made soup and burned it and they ate it anyway. June came late, with her notebook, and took off her shoes at the door and put her socks flat on the wood like someone touching a lake with cautious toes. June looked at the letters and did not look. She put the notebook on the table with the tenderness of someone putting a sleeping cat down. She was a thick-boned woman with a straight mouth. She had the gift of making people feel less ridiculous in their own heads.\n\n\u201cYou are in something,\u201d she said to Evan after they had watched the part of the speech where the Primarch spoke about love. \u201cYou know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou will call me when your name is spoken again. You will call me before you leave with anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did call you,\u201d he said, aware of the childishness of pointing out that Mina had. \u201cIn my head.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's not how telephones work,\u201d she said, and wrote something in her notebook. He craned, feeling ungallant, and saw that she had drawn a spoon.\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong with me?\u201d he asked, some time later, when they had all become quieter. \u201cWhy do I feel like this is a family event? Why do I feel like a holiday is coming and I am going to ruin it by saying something true?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is wrong yet,\u201d June said. \u201cWait for wrong. It will come. It always comes on time. It has a watch that works.\u201d\n\nHe thought of clocks. He thought of the one on the wall that had stopped at 2:17 on the day the building lost power and never restarted in a way that mattered. He thought of his father\u2019s watch, which had ticked loudly in the hospital room the last hour and then had not ticked anymore and then had ticked again when the nurse shook it absentmindedly, and how he had wanted to slap the nurse not for shaking it but for restoring time after his father had left it. He thought of the drawer and the word destroy that waited like a dog in a kennel in his throat.\n\nHe thought of Eider.\n\nAt two in the morning, when the city had switched to the people who believe in two in the morning\u2014the bakers, the drunks, the watchers at every kind of window\u2014he went to the desk and opened the bottom letter. He had told himself he would not, but also the letter had told him he would. So who was in charge of whom? He read. The letter was short, a postcard pretending to be a letter, a scrap pretended into importance. It said:\n\nHello, love. Time is syrup. It is going to be a thick morning. There is a lever disguised as a drawer. There is a song disguised as a letter. If you sing it, things will go away. We only make space when we cannot make peace. Do not forgive me when it happens. That will be our sin together.\n\nThe signature was not a signature. It was a drawing of a bird with its wings folded as if sleeping.\n\nHe pressed the paper to his face and smelled it and it smelled like oranges and noise and the hospital room with his father gone and the radiator tick, tick, tick. He had the sense of being on a staircase with a door he could open and not open both. He had the sense of a thing that had already happened and the way you feel about it is what changes when you change. He wanted to be, absurdly, a better person.\n\nHe put the letter away. He closed the drawer. It rattled in a way he had begun to dream. He lay on the couch and closed his eyes and made a bargain with a God he did not believe in and a primate he did not trust and a future he did not want. He promised nothing. That felt like a relief. He slept a shallow sleep with pockets in it.\n\nIn the morning, the city had a new banner. It said WE WILL KNOW EACH OTHER. Children were drawing it on the sidewalks in dust. They had been told what to write and they had been given the chalk as a kindness. A boy with a cowlick asked Evan if letters could be dangerous and Evan said no because he was not prepared to be the kind of man who tells a child the truth. The boy said, My mother says apes eat letters, and Evan laughed despite himself and then stopped and said that no, they do not, that was a silly thing to say, and the boy said, She says it about the mail, not the animals. He walked away then, relieved to be stupid in the presence of a child.\n\nHe walked to the Ministry with the letter that was the wrong one wrapped like bread. The building breathed around him, like a big lung. The lobby had a mural of the river with fish. He handed the letter to Kass, who took it with hands that were careful and a scar that was real. Creel watched with her mind\u2019s lens.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Kass said, and he believed she meant it. \u201cWe can say the word we were told to say. We can say cradle.\u201d\n\n\u201cCradle,\u201d he repeated, and the word did something to the air, like a small hole you can see through to a better room, not because the room is better but because your mind makes it so. He was a sucker for holes.\n\n\u201cWould you like to see him?\u201d Creel asked as if asking if he would like more coffee that he couldn\u2019t drink.\n\n\u201cSee who?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Primarch,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked for you.\u201d\n\nHe felt an absurd ripple of pride and then it died on the beach of his actual self. \u201cI have errands,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a life. I have to\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to go home and open the drawer,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you want me to say it?\u201d\n\nHe did something then that he had not planned to do. He let them take him. He walked into a room with a glass wall and a view of the dome and the river and the banners and the heat and the birds that were not there. The Primarch sat with his back to the glass. He was smaller than he was on television, and more precise, like a sculpture you had seen in pictures and had not realized the artist had carved the hand veins. He turned and looked at Evan with a curiosity that made a liar of Evan\u2019s enmity.\n\n\u201cMr. Saye,\u201d he said. \u201cWe share a love of drawers.\u201d\n\n\u201cShould I laugh?\u201d Evan asked. He was asking himself.\n\nThale made a shape with his mouth that was not human. \u201cDo you know the story,\u201d he said, \u201cof the woman who kept all the winds in a bag?\u201d\n\n\u201cPandora,\u201d Evan said automatically, and then shook his head. \u201cNo. Someone else. A lesser-known myth with no box and no hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cNames shift,\u201d Thale said. \u201cWe have been carried in your bags and your boxes. We appreciate containers. We are respectful of edges. We do not step over lines unless invited.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are inviting yourselves,\u201d Evan said.\n\nThale inclined his great head. He had a scar on his jaw, white with oldness. \u201cYour father understood something about edges,\u201d he said. \u201cHe understood that the only way to leave a circle is to draw a larger one and step into it. We thought he was our friend, Mr. Saye. Perhaps he was. We need a friend now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm not your friend,\u201d Evan said, but it sounded like someone else\u2019s line, because of course he was not, but of course he was standing in a room with him, of course he had brought the wrong letter like a supplicant with the wrong coin for the ferry. \u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\nThale\u2019s hand moved, huge and delicate, as if he were going to pluck a fruit from an invisible bowl. \u201cBecause you keep things,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are a keeper. You do not burn. We have burned so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have burned some,\u201d Evan said. \u201cNot enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will help you,\u201d Thale said, and the way he said it made it sound like an act of mercy and not a threat. \u201cWe will make the edges neat.\u201d\n\nEvan wanted, desperately, a small old-fashioned dissatisfaction, some petty thing to object to: you cut your suit wrong, your tie is too bright, the coffee is too hot. He had no such reliefs. He was in the center of something large and he was not going to get any of the pleasures of smallness. He was going to be used, perhaps even by himself.\n\nHe went home. He opened the drawer. He placed the letters in the order the letter had described without looking like he was doing it. He chewed the stamp and spit it into the tissue he had prepared in case it mattered. He wiped his mouth and felt ridiculous. He said the name Eider quietly, and when nothing happened he said it louder and then louder until he heard the apartment change shape. The radiator ticked in a new meter. The kettle made a sea sound. The drawer became empty and then not empty in a way that the eye cannot be trusted to describe.\n\nSomething woke. Or the word is unfroze. Or the word is corrected. The room did a small bow. He felt a hand on his shoulder that was not a hand. He felt an apology in his bones. He felt the world unbutton one button and then a second.\n\nMina knocked and opened and stood with a bag of fruit in the doorway and said, \u201cNo,\u201d once, an almost-laugh, the sound you make when you see a wave and you are already ankle-deep, you can\u2019t stop it now. June came behind her, late again, with her notebook, and the Primarch\u2019s motorcade honked three times somewhere across the river, the low honk of patience.\n\nEvan looked at the letters and knew, in a factual way, that they were a machine, a small dirty machine with love stains on it, a machine that did not belong in the world because it would take the world away from itself, cleanly, the way a magician removes the birthday coin from behind your ear and shows you the empty hand. He knew. He did not tell them. He asked if anyone wanted tea. He put the kettle on to boil. He leaned against the counter and thought of his father\u2019s last laugh.\n\nHe would press his hands on the drawer and say the next word when it was time. He was going to fail to save anyone. He would do it anyway, like a man who tips his hat to an empty church.\n\nHe looked out the window and saw a banner catch on a streetlight and tear itself in two. He watched it fall, both halves trying to be a whole. He thought, We will know each other.\n\nHe thought, I will destroy you. He thought, I will destroy us. He thought, I will open the drawer.\n\nThe drawer rattled, once, rude. A cough from a sick child in a library. He wanted to shush it. He wanted to say, Hush, we\u2019re all reading. He wanted to say, We\u2019re all here. We\u2019re present. It\u2019s time.",

                              "content": "The kettle sang itself toward a boil and then, strangely, away from it, as if the sound had been placed on a shelf and someone with long fingers had moved it a few inches to the left. Mina stood with the fruit bag half-open, the citrus shining like moons of a small, friendly planet, and June leaned against the doorframe as if the building leaned on her in turn. None of them spoke because there was a new sound in the apartment, thin and fine as a hair in the throat. For a heartbeat Evan thought it was in the radiator again, that old, domestic telegraph. Then he understood it was the drawer.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t that it rattled. It held still with a posture that suggested some absence was doing the moving for it. If a cupboard can think, the drawer seemed to be considering a new idea. He had never believed wood could be intent, but intention was in the grain now, a fine attention drawn along by the weight of words. He told himself to stop being ridiculous and then felt the patience of the ridiculous gather itself in the corners, like dust that had learned to wait for a particular boot.\n\nHe went to it because he had to go to it; there was no choreography where he did not. He laid his palms on the old wood and felt a temperature that wasn\u2019t warm and wasn\u2019t cool, a body temperature borrowed from no body. If he had been the version of himself who still wore ties and corrected undergraduates on the distinction between primary and secondary sources, he would have described the sensation as archival. It had the quiet of stack basements, the muffled hum of the regulator fan, the sense that one wrong breath would dislodge a century.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything yet,\u201d June said, and he loved her for assuming that he could do anything and for postponing it with a phrase like the one nurses use before they slide a needle in. \u201cJust tell me what you feel.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike we\u2019ve been asked a question,\u201d he said without thinking. \u201cAnd like the person who asked it is in the next room and has decided to let us sweat.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very specific,\u201d Mina said, but her voice had gotten small, the way posture gets small when someone in the train car raises their voice and everything vibrates along.\n\nThe letter with the bird-wings signature lay where he had put it, barely in view, a corner like a tooth. He had not said the third thing aloud and would not until the word in his mouth stopped feeling like a treachery. The instruction in the letter had been so precise that it made the rest of his life look like smudged chalk. The clarity frightened him more than the content. He had grown used to a certain muddle. A bright line is a cruel thing.\n\nThe kettle committed to the boil. He flicked it off, and the room, deprived, made a small complaining noise: the air adjusting itself, the pipes remembering they are pipes. He poured. He moved his hand at the speed of someone taking shortened steps to avoid the attention of a predator. Mina made the tea weak because she was afraid of getting anything wrong. June took hers without asking for sugar, which was the same as asking for nothing.\n\n\u201cEvan,\u201d Mina said, and stopped there, his name holding his face like a hand. \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said truthfully. He did not add that he had a way of finding out. He did not say the thing about the third word and light that is not light. He was tired of being a man who held the plot and chewed it like a bad actor with a prop. He had never wanted to be the stage manager of a disaster.\n\nOutside, a siren passed that had learned a new tone in a new decade, a polite whoop that made you guilty for ignoring it. The morning was committing itself to brightness in a grudging way. He could just see the edge of the new banner from the kitchen window where a neighbor had trussed it, the slogan like a noun phrase on a page where someone forgot to put the verb back. Children\u2019s chalk had done what chalk does: it had dusted the air around the words with a tiny, cheerful mistake. The banner snagged on the bracket and a scrape-string caught in the wind and played a song that no one had asked it to play.\n\n\u201cWho did your father write to?\u201d June asked. Her voice was careful, the voice she used with kids in stairwells when she knew they had a knife and also knew they would not want to use it if asked not to in the right voice. \u201cThe person. The person who isn\u2019t you. The person who\u2019s in these like a shadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cA colleague,\u201d he said, automatically, because that was the word he had been given. It was the safe noun you use when fear makes you prefer the office to the bed. \u201cSomeone with a program name. Eider. Maybe Eider is a person and maybe it\u2019s a hat everyone wore when they wanted to walk unseen through important rooms.\u201d\n\n\u201cPretend with me for a second that Eider is a person,\u201d June said. She didn\u2019t write as she spoke; she let the pencil rest on the paper in the same way surgeons rest their hands so they can make smaller movements in a minute. \u201cWhat did Eider want?\u201d\n\nThere was the childishness of saying, Me. He did not indulge himself. He thought instead of the feeling he had had when the letters lined up with what was happening outside the window, the little electricity that ran up his spine like a hand sleeking a cat backwards. He thought of the paragraph that had started with a joke\u2014This is not mystical\u2014and had refused to stay a joke.\n\n\u201cThey wanted someone to pull a rope they couldn\u2019t pull from where they were,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wanted a hand that can reach into a place a hand shouldn\u2019t. They wanted a good boy who doesn\u2019t burn to make up for the bad boy who burns too easily. They wanted my father to teach me how to like drawers more than matches.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d Mina asked, and her smile made a small, bitter kindness of the word like. \u201cDo you like drawers more than matches?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a person who writes to archivists when I am angry and am comforted by the receipt of a polite acknowledgment three days later,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, yes.\u201d\n\nThe buzzer pressed its mouth hard into the wall and spoke. June and Mina both twitched in a synchronized recoil that would have amused him in the old days. He told himself not to push the talk button and pushed it anyway. When habit has been fed enough times, it is a dog in the kitchen at your heel; it will sit when you tell it to sit, but it will also sit when you do nothing at all, because sitting is its comfort.\n\n\u201cDelivery,\u201d the voice said, and he allowed himself the stupid hope that it would be some mistake, a parcel meant for a neighbor, a calendar subscription he had forgotten to cancel.\n\n\u201cFrom whom?\u201d June asked, leaning to the speaker without touching it, an old game of not leaving prints that felt like respect even now when prints had become quaint, like stamps.\n\n\u201cHarmony,\u201d the voice said, and paused as if they might know another Harmony and prefer it. \u201cFruit.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fruit,\u201d Mina mouthed at him without sound, then shook her head like a person reading in a car, trying to shake the nausea off.\n\nThey let the man in. He was a man, a human man with a clean shirt and a polite haircut and a jaw that had known a barber recently but not this morning. He carried a carton with the logo of a company that had gone bankrupt and been bought and then had un-remembered its bankruptcy by changing the color of its font. He smiled. We had grown used to being the animals who smiled too much.\n\n\u201cMr. Saye?\u201d he asked, as if there might be two of them within and both might prefer not to claim the name.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Evan said. He moved to intercept the delivery before it could cross to the desk, before fruit could be set within touching distance of the drawer. He had the very dire superstition that round things would roll.\n\n\u201cCompliments of the Ministry,\u201d the man said. \u201cIn honor of the day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat day?\u201d Mina said, her hand a clamp on the back of a chair.\n\n\u201cThe day,\u201d he said, as if that helped. He looked at June then, and his smile restructured itself for authority. \u201cWith our thanks,\u201d he added, and he was gone with an efficiency that left the shape of him behind the way a hot pan leaves a phantom circle on the counter.\n\nIt was a box of plums. The plums had that bloom on them, the pale astronomical mist that makes fruit look like it belongs in the sky. They were heavy. He felt suddenly the exact old weight of his father\u2019s hand in his hand, the way you memorize a person\u2019s mass unconsciously when you carry them to bed once.\n\n\u201cI hate that they always know what to bring,\u201d Mina said. \u201cIt\u2019s insulting that they\u2019re good at the mundane.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a language,\u201d June said. \u201cIt\u2019s always a language first.\u201d\n\nEvan took one plum and thought about dropping it into the drawer like a coin. He did not. He put them all on the counter and thought that if the world ends at least they would have eaten a perfect piece of fruit on the last morning. He washed three and they each ate one with the space between bites feeling ceremonial as silence between vows. The flesh was green-gold and the juice ran down his wrist in a way that made him feel adolescent and sad.\n\nThe apartment was all apartment again, and then the room tilted toward a person who was not in it. He felt the way a sound happens in bone before it happens in air. He wanted to put his hands over his ears and also to press his ear to the old wood like a child eavesdropping at a hotel door. He put his ear to the drawer. He was past humiliation. June didn\u2019t comment; she had taught humiliation to take a seat on her left like a partner at a dance.\n\nIt came not as a voice exactly, because when a voice comes out of a wooden thing in your apartment you move out or call a priest, and he could do neither. It came as an agreement in his spine. It was the sensation of nodding without moving your head.\n\nI am late, it said, and if you pinched him, if you asked him later in a court of reasonable men what exactly had been said, he would grind his teeth on the question and say: It told me it was late. But the words in his mind had a tailored width, a seam let out at the shoulder and taken in at the waist. They fit.\n\n\u201cYou hear it?\u201d he asked before he could stop himself from being a clich\u00e9.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina said immediately. Her eyes were the eyes of a person being asked to participate in a s\u00e9ance against her will. \u201cNo, and I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d June said, surprising them both. \u201cNot like a radio. Like a permission.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask permission for what. He wanted to be the kind of man who did not wait to be told which questions he was allowed. He chewed the inside of his cheek and tasted a metallic tang as if he had bitten tinfoil. He looked at June and then at Mina and then at his own hands, because he trusted his hands to tell him the truth more than his head now. They were not shaking. That was something.\n\n\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d he asked the empty room. If there is a god of drawers, let it be someone\u2019s job to hold that title with dignity.\n\nThe answer was small and sufficient.\n\nRead.\n\nThe panic bloomed in him as if it had been waiting under his tongue for that word. He had been doing anything but. He had been a scientist standing next to a pond refusing to test the water. He had been a child counting steps and never looking up to see the door at the top. He was so tired of his own caution he could chew through it. He put his fingertips under the string, lifted the bundle as if it had lungs, and took out the third letter. He did not know why the third; the choice felt like his and not-his in the precise, confusing proportion that had become his daily patience.\n\nJune pulled a chair very quietly a half-inch closer to him and did not sit. Mina backed up a step and then returned it because she was someone who corrected her own cowardice with immediate, liberal applications of bravery. He did not say he was grateful because gratitude felt like a limited resource and he had become stingy.\n\nThe letter had been folded and refolded by someone who had cared and was not alive to care anymore in the same way. It had a crease like a healed cut. He slid it open.\n\nDear E., the letter said, and his body turned into a bridge with night trains rumbling across. Evan loved diminutives only when they were earned in bed or wrested on a playground. In ink they tended to feel like a trick, a way of making you small so you fit in the apparatus. His father had signed one, once, with a mere initial as if he had been wearing someone else\u2019s suit all day and had now stripped it down to the undershirt.\n\nYou will have the box by now, the letter said. You will have the look in your eyes that men get when they are asked to babysit a bomb and not tell anyone that the baby is not a baby. This is not, I swear to you, the project everyone pretends we were working on. That project is the stage set and it squeaks if you touch it and the paint is wet forever. This is smaller and ungovernable and shared. The good ones will want to ritualize it; the bad ones will want to own it. We have to do something else. We have to distribute the wrong thing in the right shape and the right thing in the wrong shape and hope the difference makes enough delay to allow something we don\u2019t have a name for to be born. I am calling it the cradle so I can say the word without spitting.\n\nHe felt June\u2019s gaze settle on the single word like a cup on a saucer. He did not look up. He had the feeling he had had as a boy when he had leaned too far over the balcony at the library and his father had put a hand flat on his back and pressed him forward a quarter-inch further, because some parents teach you not to fear edges by letting you see where the ground will not be and trusting you to be wise. He and his father had been idiots together; it\u2019s one of the ways we love.\n\nYou will be asked to let them help you, the letter said. You will be asked to describe the phrase \u201cspace unmaking,\u201d and someone with a scar on her hand will flinch when you do because she knows what that means in a place where memory is a hallway. You do not have to be brave in the way they like bravery, the way you step out and become an emblem they can hang from light poles. You have to be brave in the way I know you know, the family way, the way where you stay in the room a minute longer than any sane person would and you notice the thing no one else notices because they have eyes for spectacle and you have eyes for margins. The margins will flutter when the Drawer is awake. You will see it in the page count. You will see it in the lists. You will see it in the way a cataloger\u2019s pen hesitates over the word complete.\n\nHe made a sound he had not intended to make. It was the sound of recognition you hear when a dog sees its owner from across a park and cannot contain itself. He had been cataloging his whole life. He had made peace with making peace with boredom. And here his father had left him a religion in the very grammar of his days.\n\nWhat does it do, you are going to ask me with your mouth and also with your teeth, because I have kept your hands empty for too long, the letter said. It makes room. Don\u2019t look like that. You are making the face you make when you see a baby and forget three of the disasters you were remembering so vividly before you saw the baby, and you resent yourself for it later in the privacy of your bed. It makes room not in the soft sense but in the hard sense. It takes the bit of space that insists on its occupation and it unhooks one end of it and the rest follows, like a zipper. The thing that is unhooked does not fall anywhere. It is not like your belief in down. It is like the way a sentence stops being a sentence when I remove the verb. The subject feels insulted. The object feels unrumpled. Only later do you realize you have been standing in the absence of action.\n\nHe heard something like a sigh from the letters themselves. He told himself it was the apartment and felt, for a second, the old superstitions knock with their soft bones. He let them knock. He did not have to open to every caller. He could peek through and see that they had no weapon but the weapon of being old, and he could respect that, which is not nothing.\n\nThere is a trick, the letter said, for making sure you do not take the wrong bit of space, because you will want very much to take the bit where someone has placed their chair and is doing harm to someone in a chair. You must not. If you do that, everything gets small in the way children\u2019s furniture gets small and you will be the monkey at the tea party moving tiny cups around while the adults watch and clap, and that will be the end of us. You have to take what repeats. Your father would have told you this if we had had one more dinner, that thing he does with his hands when he is describing a pattern. Left, left, right, left, and then again with your eyes closed. What repeats is the wiring, not the wall. You do not remove walls. You remove routes.\n\nHe put the letter down and swallowed a burn that had come up his throat like a mild insult. He had no idea what that meant and also he knew, in the same way you know how to walk home in the dark if you have done it enough times. You follow the sounds. You follow the lights that are out and know why.\n\n\u201cRead it,\u201d June said when she saw him stop. It wasn\u2019t a command. It was like someone saying the name of a river you have to cross because the only bridge is two miles upstream. \u201cRead it all before you let yourself think you understood any of it.\u201d\n\nHe took a breath that felt like a page turning. He read.\n\nWe practice on small things, the letter said. We practice on a spoon. I am not being poetic. You think I am, because you are your father\u2019s son and you love the clean click of metaphor. No. Take a spoon that you have eaten from. Do not describe it. Do not give it a past. Touch the concavity with the pad of your finger. Say its name in the way that you would say your own if you were answering a roll call. Then ask the Drawer to make room for that curve. You will feel apple-pit spit in your mouth. That is how you will know it worked. The spoon will still be on the counter because space is not the same as object. This is what we keep failing to teach the Primarch\u2019s people. We keep explaining contracts to a nation of hands.\n\nHe looked down at the spoon June had drawn and then at the spoon on the counter, the one with the small hook-mark where it had fallen once into the disposal and survived the moment with only a souvenir. June made a face that said she was both sick of coincidences and resigned to them. Mina whispered, \u201cOf course,\u201d because she had the journalist\u2019s hunger for the tiny object that tells the whole story in a better voice than any human interviewee.\n\nNo, you do not get to ask the Drawer to take the door you don\u2019t like, the letter went on. No, you do not get to make room in a room where someone you love is trapped and you cannot get to them and the hallway has been made stupid on purpose. If you try, you will get the statutes wrong. If you try, you will remove the very thing you will later wish you had had when it is time to run, because that is what grief will do to your mouth. This is not a lesson. Lessons are for children. I am telling you how we survived one week longer than the modelers predicted. You will be angry when you understand this because I am giving you a limit and you do not like limits unless you are the one putting them on the table and calling them dinner.\n\nHe put the letter down again and let his body do the thing where you stand and then sit because you forgot that sitting is possible. Mina made a noise like a laugh that had been sent to its room for bad behavior and had returned chastened. June set her hand flat on the table, and he watched the way her thumb rested separate from the other fingers. His father\u2019s voice said, small things, in that irritated, loving tone that parents use when they are old enough not to be pretentious about what they care about.\n\n\u201cTry the spoon,\u201d Mina said, and her eyes told him she was saying this not because she believed but because believing or not believing should not matter. \u201cIf nothing happens we make more tea and we eat another plum and we all take a nap like soldiers in bad novels who have to fight in the afternoon.\u201d\n\nHe picked up the spoon. It was rougher than he had expected. The old habit of the sink had scuffed it into a private geography. He held it with the same careful disrespect with which he had once held the tail of a dead mouse he had had to carry to the trash because Mina had refused to touch it and June had refused to indulge him. He touched the concavity. He said, into the hard, bright air, \u201cSpoon,\u201d in the way you say your own name when you are at the doctor and you have an appointment at a particular time and you do not want to be called twice.\n\nThe drawer did not move. The room did a small, private adjustment the way rooms do when you shift the chair half an inch to the left. The shift was not in the spoon. The shift was in his mouth. He wanted to spit. He had not eaten an apple, but the bitter, dry, granular mark of the pit was under his tongue. It was instantly and intimately hateful.\n\nMina shrieked gently. June said, \u201cOkay,\u201d as if she had been given a new tool at work and was assessing how often it would break and whether there were screws small enough in the kit to fix it. Evan put the spoon down very carefully and then much too quickly as if it were a bee, and it clattered and the sound fell into the drawer as if the wood wanted it. He wiped his tongue on his teeth, performed the useless ceremony of disgust that civilization permits you, and laughed with his mouth closed because open laughs are for men at bars and boys in alleys and not for people losing their relationship to matter.\n\n\u201cDo you notice anything else?\u201d June asked after a moment in which they all tried to be ordinary people in a kitchen under a banner with an exhortation that would not feed anyone. \u201cThe margins.\u201d\n\nHe looked around the apartment like a tourist who keeps seeing something most is not looking at. He looked for the edges. The book on the counter was one he had left open to a chapter on landscape architecture before the Floods; it had a half-formed paragraph about terraces. The page number on the left said 184. The page number on the right did not say 185. It did not say anything. His heart did one large drum and then sat down to rest.\n\n\u201cThat,\u201d he said, and put his finger on the page as if the empty could be underlined. \u201cI think that is what he meant about complete.\u201d\n\nHe saw, too, that the postcard on the refrigerator with his aunt\u2019s scrawl had lost the little drawing of the dog, as if the dog had walked off the paper while they were all sleeping. He saw that the list he had made with his father\u2019s watch-keeping insistence\u2014milk, foil, rice, soap\u2014was now three words long, but he had not used any of the items and he could remember writing all four. He would have loved, in another life, to discuss this with a patient woman with a bob in an office. He would have loved to describe the way loss takes the shape of utility before it takes the shape of grief.\n\n\u201cYou took the route,\u201d June said, looking at the empty page number like a small moon. \u201cHe\u2019s right. You didn\u2019t take the wall. You took the habit of getting from one to the other. You took the counting.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate that I understand that instantly,\u201d Mina said, and put a hand to her mouth and pressed on it as if words were going to fall out and stain the floor. \u201cI hate that I can feel the trip of my eyes over the page expecting the number and that I have to step over the space like there\u2019s a dead thing there on the sidewalk and I am a person with good shoes who will not step in it.\u201d\n\nEvan sat. He wanted another plum and did not take one. He wanted to put the letters back in their string and hammer the drawer shut and call a carpenter to paint it shut as if paint were a law. He wanted his father alive just long enough to pat him on the shoulder and say, See, not to comfort him but to be infuriating in the way he had been infuriating, in the way that had made Evan who he was even if who he was had turned into a technology.\n\nThe phone vibrated. June, whose body had a private relationship to alarms, grabbed it the way a mother grabs a child about to run into the road. She read, and her face put on the expression it wore when she had to tell someone something they could not unknow without opening some small mercy\u2019s throat. She turned the screen toward him. It was a message from an unknown number formatted in the way official messages were formatted now so you could take a screenshot and show your friends that the official voice had sat down and written to you. The message said:\n\nMr. Saye. The Primarch will be making a private statement at noon. Your presence is requested at the Dome, east entrance. Your escort will arrive at 11:40. Please bring the item you have been instructed to bring. We will say the necessary word at the door.\n\nHe did not look up. He saw his father\u2019s handwriting in the typed words and knew that was impossible and also exactly necessary. He saw Kass\u2019s scar in the way the line breaks had been placed. He saw Creel\u2019s mind in the repetition of please. He heard the word cradle underlined and underlined again.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going,\u201d Mina said, then corrected herself in the way of honest women. \u201cYou are going and I am angry at the inevitability of it, which is a stupid thing to be angry at. I am also going.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am going,\u201d June said, not looking at either of them, making a small mark with her pencil on the paper as if she were marking the place where something would be found later when the floor was being taken up.\n\n\u201cI will not take it,\u201d he said. \u201cI will take it. I am a liar. I will take it because not taking it makes me a different liar. I will take it and not do what they want. I will take it and let it tell me what it is.\u201d\n\nMina put her forehead on the back of his head like a benediction. He let himself be benedicted. He wanted to keep his grandmother\u2019s diction of religion, all dim lamps and old paperbacks and a God who was a quiet cupboard, and he wanted to keep it even while he constructed a machine for unmaking space on his kitchen table with fruit and tea and a spoon that had lost a ghost number.\n\nHe put on his jacket. It had acquired an authority his shirts didn\u2019t have, as if the pockets kept a secret not his. He tucked the wrong letter\u2014a different wrong letter, he thought with a small, very poor joke that made him feel like a man whistling in a dark basement\u2014into the inner pocket where he had kept, as a young man, a condom in a case that made him feel like a person in a movie whose name starts with Mister. He took the bundle and wrapped it in paper the color of the old wall behind a painting, the clean square that tells you what the room used to be. He tied it with string and felt a ceremonial silliness and told himself to stop calling it silly. Nothing ceremonial is silly when the ceremony is the only way to ask the world to bend a fraction in your direction.\n\nThe escort was early by seven minutes like polite kidnappers. Kass was in the back, her scar visible now above the knuckle where it belonged. Creel had a scarf today, and it was not the one that would have told him anything. He had become a reader of scarves, a thing he would have mocked in any other life.\n\n\u201cYou look like someone who has not slept,\u201d Creel said, and made it tender in a way he would not forgive her for later. \u201cThank you for bringing what we asked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know that I have,\u201d he said, and then wished he had saved the line, because it felt good and he did not get enough lines lately that felt good to say.\n\n\u201cWe never know,\u201d Kass said. \u201cWe suspect.\u201d\n\nThe drive to the Dome was across a city that had rubbed half its letters off the signs. He tried not to look and looked. A street name had lost its saint. A pharmacy had become harmacy, and he flinched because the joke was cruelly good, the apes always good with the pun when they wanted to be. A diner\u2019s WINDOW SERVICE NOW OPEN had become WIN OW SER VICE NOW PEN, and he felt a particular grief for the missing D as if he had a friend with that initial who had failed to show up for a subway rendezvous. His brain was a drunk at a party where someone is doing coin tricks. He wanted to sit down.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing it,\u201d Creel said, almost an apology. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing the lacunae.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d he said, and hated himself and did not take it back.\n\nAt the Dome, the banners were organized into obedience like schoolchildren whose teacher had a stick. The word WE had been reinforced so thick with paint that it gleamed in a third dimension. He wondered if he could unmake a pronoun and what the riot would be like then. He wondered if the drawer would scold him for the thought. The car let them out at a side door where the people who do the noise do their noise from, and he felt in the pocket of the building the way a mouse must feel when it runs along the baseboard. He was not made for these rooms that professionalized sound. He liked noises that came from kettles and the very particular squeak of a page you turn too slowly.\n\nIn a holding area that smelled like dust that thought too highly of itself, Creel took the string-bound packet from him and set it on the table and touched it with two fingers like a woman touching her wedding dress in a photograph. Kass watched the door. The door watched itself in the reflective plate and prepared to open for something large. There were men with wires in their ears and another woman with a suit that looked as if it had been cut with a knife you use for meat and not for paper. There was a breeze you only get near men who wear certain shoes.\n\n\u201cYou have three minutes,\u201d Creel said. \u201cHe wants to see the object.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants to see me with the object,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she admitted. \u201cHe likes the way we look at one another around important things. He thinks of it as a test of eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a word,\u201d Evan said. \u201cIf anyone threatens me with a word, I have a word.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all do,\u201d Creel said, smiling. \u201cWe all pretend that when we say \u2018cradle\u2019 the room will grow softer. It is my private joy that sometimes it does.\u201d\n\nThale came in like a man doing his best impersonation of a man coming in. There was nothing to say about his size that had not already been said. There was everything to say about the way he held himself slightly to the side of his own body, as if he were reminding himself not to be photographed from the angle he preferred. He sat and he did not smile because smiling had been taken from him by years of people saying you don\u2019t have to, it looks wrong. He leaned forward, and the room leaned forward to meet him, the way a room does for people who have learned to deserve attention across decades of being told to speak.\n\n\u201cMr. Saye,\u201d he said. \u201cYou smell like a plum.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sent them,\u201d Evan said, and then reddened, an old flush he had not felt since he was a boy and had accused a teacher of cheating at a game of hangman and had been wrong.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Thale said. \u201cFruit is a language your people invented for hospitality and we felt left out for a long time. Now we overdo it. It is a national failing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the object,\u201d Creel said, and placed the letters in the center of the table and did not remove the string. Thale made a sound that could have been pleased or could have been disgusted; remind me to ask the linguists, a part of Evan\u2019s brain said, and another part kicked it under the table for trying to survive with hobbies.\n\n\u201cTell me the story,\u201d Thale said, and the way he said it was an insult to storytellers everywhere. He meant:\n\nTell me which lever to pull.\n\nEvan put his hands on either side of the bundle and thought of a picture of an old bomb, the kind with the tail fins. He thought of someone going out to a field with a toolkit that would fit in a purse and lying down next to a threat and humming under their breath while they worked. He thought of the third word. He closed his mouth. He opened it again and chose a half-true thing, the kind of thing poets get crucified for.\n\n\u201cIt makes room,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was a beat like the beat between a threat and a swing. Thale did not move his head and managed to look at him differently. \u201cWhere?\u201d the Primarch said.\n\n\u201cIn lists,\u201d Evan said. \u201cIn page numbers. In the routes our eyes make when we don\u2019t think we\u2019re moving.\u201d\n\n\u201cUseful,\u201d Thale said, and the word had the politest contempt for the domestic he had ever heard. It was the voice of a king being told how to darn. \u201cWe can make good use of that. We can make people not go where they would go if they could read where to go. We can make crowds soft.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can unmake your own gravity,\u201d Evan said, surprising himself, surprising Kass with the speed of her head turn, surprising Creel with the way she set her lips. \u201cYou can forget how to walk back to the place you built for us. You can lose the trail; it\u2019s not a threat, it\u2019s a fact. You do not get to be the only makers of habit in this city and then resent the habit when it goes on without you for a day.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are here,\u201d Thale said. He did not hit the word the way he did in speeches. He lapped it like a drink. \u201cAnd you remain charming in a way we have decided to keep. Tell me the word that opens it.\u201d\n\nEvan looked at his own reflection in the polished metal housed in the corner and saw a man who might as well be wearing a tie all wrong. He saw the missing numbers on the page and the missing dog and the missing saint. He saw the spoon. He saw his father\u2019s empty chair. He saw Eider\u2019s bird drawn with a hand that had not wanted to sign a name. He thought of the instruction, the things you should not do because you will be the monkey at the tea party moving tiny cups around for someone else\u2019s entertainment. He thought of routes and of removing them and of crowds that cannot get back in time to be counted.\n\n\u201cCradle,\u201d he said, not because it answered the question, but because the word in his mouth was a little cave with a small fire in it, and he had felt cold for years. The guards moved as if someone had corrected their posture. Creel looked like someone whose joke had finally been told back to her and landed. Kass had the expression of a person adding two odd numbers and getting an even number that had a second sense.\n\n\u201cYou know that word,\u201d Thale said, and there was something like admiration in the bottom of his voice like a coin lost in a couch. \u201cWe are learning it. You have such good words for how you hold fragile things and we have such good hands. It is a pity for you that language turned out to be a cabinet.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen don\u2019t open it,\u201d Evan said. \u201cWalk around it. Build a table instead and we\u2019ll eat at it until we die and no one will know there was a cabinet.\u201d\n\nThale laughed, a sound like dropped stones arranged all at once into a wall. \u201cWalk around it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou speak like a man who has never been turned away from a door. We walked around your world for a century and brought you your own baskets and your own paper and your own ballots and your own dead from the downcountry and now we would like to open something when we are tired.\u201d\n\nHe put his hand on the packet, and the drawer in Evan\u2019s apartment, across the river and up three flights and under a window where the morning had drawn itself like a simple line, shivered as if a sleeping animal had rolled to face the wall. He put the other hand on the table, and the table made a noise as if remembering the person who had built it and regretting the joints.\n\n\u201cYou will tell us the word,\u201d Thale said, and it was not a threat. It was the softest prediction. \u201cYou will not like the music otherwise.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe music?\u201d Mina said, coming in because she had refused not to come in, because Creel had looked away at the wrong moment thinking someone else had barred the door and no one had. \u201cAlways with the music metaphors. You all are so predictable.\u201d\n\nThale turned his head and looked at her and folded gentleness around his eyes the way you fold napkins because the guest is a woman and you want to look good in your civil grooming. \u201cWe have been mocked for our love of percussion,\u201d he said, and his mouth did something almost like amusement. \u201cWe have learned melody. Forgive us for our new love.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Mina said. \u201cI don\u2019t forgive you anything. I have a list. It has the word \u201cferry\u201d on it a hundred times. You\u2019re not the first tyrant who liked a tune.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvan,\u201d June said, very softly, because she could feel what was about to happen as if she were standing in the same room as the weather. \u201cDon\u2019t say the name.\u201d\n\nHe could have said it then, in a room covered by cameras and men and promises. He could have said the name that would turn the drawer into a fact for people who thought facts were warheads. He could have placed the word in the world and watched it behave. He did not. He stepped back in his mind a half-inch, the way his father had put his hand on his back and pushed him forward. He stepped backward instead, and in that small refusal there was a music that belonged only to him.\n\n\u201cI will say nothing in front of him,\u201d he said, because saying him was a disrespect you could get away with, a tiny, private spit in the soup. \u201cI will write it on paper and put it under a fruit. I will tell my detective. I will whisper it into the drawer and swim.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are charming,\u201d Thale said again, and this time it was the same as being called something else. \u201cTake him home,\u201d he said to no one and everyone. \u201cFeed him. Watch the numbers.\u201d\n\nThey took him home. He asked if he could stop for milk, and they said no in a way that told him yes, later, when you walk again like a man and we are the wall you walk along with your hand trailing it for comfort. Mina did not speak until they were three blocks from the Dome and the driver had relaxed into the small slouch of a person who has performed his scene correctly and has been told so by an internal buzzer unknown to his boss.\n\n\u201cIf you had said it,\u201d she said, and did not have to define it, \u201cwhat would you have been?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe instrument,\u201d he said, and hated the easy answer. \u201cThe handle. The hand holding the handle.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used to tell me that sentence diagrams were a way to see a soul,\u201d she said, and it was one of those times when someone who loves you throws your own good line at your face to see what it does. \u201cWhat is the sentence now?\u201d\n\nHe saw it in the air. Subject: He. Verb: will. Object: us. He scratched it with his finger in the fog on the window and then wiped the window clean with the flat of his palm because he didn\u2019t want to get used to that diagram. He wanted to backspace it until it became only a smudge on glass and then nothing at all.\n\nAt home, the banner had turned itself quarter-way around on the pole. It read WE WILL NO and then was blank where the rest should be and then CH OTHER, a tender malapropism that made him want to cry. He went up the stairs. He counted again because he liked to torment himself with the possibility that the number had changed and on the ninth stair he realized a step had always been a step and he had better get used to certain kinds of disappointment.\n\nThe drawer waited like a dog with a toy in its mouth pretending disinterest. He stood with his hands on his hips like a man who had lost his keys in a movie. June took off her shoes. Mina sucked a piece of plum from her molar with a little pop.\n\nHe opened the drawer and said nothing. He looked at the pale blue paper and the envelope with the absent glue and the stamp he had chewed and the corner of the bottom letter with the bird. He looked at his own carefulness written in the way he had tucked one corner under another to keep the edges unfrayed. He remembered something his father had said in a voice he had not used often, the soft voice he reserved for secrets not because he loved secrets but because he hated the ugliness of what happens to truth when you leave it out on the counter.\n\nIf you can resist the moment of being the person who does the violent, you will become the person who makes the room. We need a room, Evan. We need a room where the thing that must be said can be said without the wrong ears. Leave it empty as long as you can. A room is the best thing we ever invented. Better than the wheel.\n\nHe had wanted to argue\u2014he had, indeed, argued then, fourteen or twenty-two or forty, he could not remember which\u2014but the drawer gave him the sensation of answering in his bones again, and the answer was temperate and hard.\n\nLater, it said, in a voice that would not be a voice. Later, when we have taken the route to their chair. Later, when their steps will take them somewhere else and they will ask us to forgive them for the inconvenience of it, and we will not forgive them, because we are not their priests. Later, and then you can say it, and it will be a word said into an empty, and it will not make a sound anyone can hear who does not love you.\n\nHe closed the drawer with a motion he had perfected as a child, a neat push and a small, responsible thump. He went to the window and watched the wind find new ways to move the dead bird of the banner. He thought of destroy as an emptiness verb and spoke it silently as if it were grace. He made tea with a spoon that had learned how to remain and he counted the page numbers he could see from across the room without getting up and left the missing one missing.\n\nWhen the second motorcade of the day passed\u2014sleeker, younger at the wheel, a new smell of hot plastic and something floral he hated without knowing the name for\u2014he did not go to the drawer like an obedient dog. He stood and he hid his hands in his pockets and he waited for the part of himself that loved obedience to go lie down on the rug. He could feel it, that part, yawning itself into gentleness. He loved it. He feared it. He fed it and did not pet it.\n\nNight would come with its small argument and its chorus of window air conditioners in the buildings that had them and its chorus of mouths in the buildings that did not. Somewhere in the middle of that song he would say the third word into the drawer and there would be a light that was not light and a disappearance that was not a theft, not in the way they meant theft in the Ministries. He would remove the route to the chair that had been built for him with his own name printed under it. He would make a room. He would fail and he would succeed and the measure of each would be a thing none of them yet had the math to speak.\n\nHe boiled the kettle again, because habit is a religion when God is in hiding. He held the cup under his nose, and the steam made his eyes water as if from honest feeling. Mina put her head on his shoulder and then took it away because she had rules she never told anyone, rules like use everything twice before you tell someone you are out of it and do not borrow sugar and do not let your man see you weep unless you would like him to weep too. June wrote the word route in her notebook and then drew something that could have been a map or a river or a child\u2019s scribble meant to be a house.\n\nHe would open the drawer when he was ready and when it was ready and when the hum in the radiator told the fillings in his teeth their names. He would say the name then, and it would be in the shape of a bird folding and unfolding its wings in a place where there is no sky. He had never wanted to be anyone\u2019s lever. He wanted to be an archivist with opinions about kettles. He was both now, and that would be the joke, and one day, if there were a day left for it, he would laugh.",

                              "content": "Night laid itself across the city with the grudging thoroughness of a bureaucrat stamping forms, and the building made the sounds of a building deciding which of its old noises to keep and which to let go. Evan waited for his nervous system to stop acting like a campsite and for the pebbly thrill along his spine to admit it was not a useful alarm. He washed the cups again as if cleanliness could legislate order, and he dried them with the dish towel with the faded pears that had belonged to his mother, and he thought that the towel had outlived so many regimes that it deserved to vote. Mina spoke in the living room without raising her voice, telling June a story about a man who had tried to interview a banner as if it were a person with a position on the world, and June made listening noises with her eyebrows because the habit of not letting your face be a transcript had kept her employed when other people had become printouts with pulses. The drawer held still with the patience of a stagehand who has hit the cue and must now let the actors believe they are free.\n\nHe had expected a horn in his head to signal the exact moment, something martial or mystical, a commandment handed down by a god that had finally remembered his name after making him wait in the anteroom with the other mortals, but what he got instead was a small domestic certainty, the one he felt on winter Tuesdays when the radiator\u2019s first tick told him the heat would hold through the night and nothing would burst in the pipes behind the wall that had never once asked his permission to be a wall. He moved to the desk with the same care he used when he pulled old forms from boxes in climate-controlled rooms where the air stayed at sixty-eight degrees like a vow, and he slid the drawer open to its agreed mouth. The letters attended, not animate and not inanimate exactly, the way the sea attends a boat that has been placed on it by hands that know boats, and he put his finger on the corner with the bird and spoke the word he had not wanted to own, not because it would make him bad, though it might, but because it would make him a person who had done something irreversible and he had built so much of himself atop the reversible.\n\nHe did not announce it to the room like a madman in a legend. He did not write it on a piece of paper first to see if the paper would shudder. He did not try it on with a whisper and then fit it more tightly with a shout. He said the name with the exact voice he used when he answered the listless roll calls of his profession, the Here that promises nothing and keeps it perfectly, and it left his mouth with a shape that was not a shape language should keep, a curve that would not diagram. He felt it catch on the grain and sit there, not absorbed and not reflected, and for a heartbeat he was terrified he had done nothing but make a fool noise at furniture, and then the room did that small bow again and the apartment forgot one little habit and the city, obedient to its own routes, discovered it was one step off the dance.\n\nLight that was not light did not flood anything. It unoccupied and left, as if someone had been sitting on a bench and stood up and you arrived in time to feel the heat in the wood and the indentation and the absence, the most articulate shape you had ever known. The kettle on the stove made the tiny smacking sound kettles make when they re-learn silence and the radiator went quiet in the same way rooms go quiet when people who are not invited enter them. Across the river, far enough that a noise should have been nothing but a rumor, there was the kind of murmuration you hear when a crowd moves and does not move and cannot explain to itself why it does either. He did not look out the window as if the looking could make him responsible. He watched the page of the landscape book where the number had once been and saw that now, instead of an empty corner, the gutter held a slightly darker white, the hint that a number had been peeled up like tape and carried away on the air to be stuck somewhere else.\n\n\u201cIt worked,\u201d Mina said, because she would always say a thing like that when she was scared and exhausted and furious, and then she put her hand on the counter because something in her wanted to grip a surface that had never tried to decide her fate. June did not say it worked because she was keeping a ledger in her head with a column labeled What It Cost and another labeled What We Tell Later, and she wrote in both columns with the same pencil and neither came out of it richer.\n\nThey learned what had been removed an hour later when the Dome, which had been built on the principle that whatever you cannot dignify you can at least organize, failed to locate its own stairs. The feed that used to be called public flickered and steadied and the shot held on a door that would not agree to be an entrance, and the camera tried to look at the stage and found only a rectangle that did not accept attention. People in coats you could recognize by cut moved with the purposeful uselessness of those who can only be in charge when the room has already agreed to the sequence, and a woman with a scarf that was no one\u2019s had a conversation with a man whose job was to lower lights and raise them, and neither of them made a light do anything at all. The teleprompter displayed the syllable We and then reconsidered. The band, because there is always a band when a state wants a story, played the first notes of a tune that wanted to be a hymn and could not get to its verb, and then they switched to something forgiving that could tolerate being stopped and started and stopped again. Evan stood with the tea he had not drunk and thought of sentences left without their heart and of the way objects get mean when you ask them to be metaphors for too long.\n\nHe did not feel triumph because triumph would have required a belief in a finish line and the letter had cured him of that disease. He felt only the relief of a man whose unwelcome guests have taken a wrong turn into a closet and are now arguing about where the kitchen went. June lowered her head and listened the way you listen to a building after a snowstorm, to see whether the roof is sorry for being a roof, and she shook her head once like a person who has learned to lower her expectations by quarter-inches and acre-feet. Mina went to the radio and turned it not on, because the radio had become an actor in this drama in a way that made everyone in the room feel watched, but down as if it were too loud already, and the gesture was so hospitable that it broke Evan\u2019s heart in a way that did not injure him.\n\nA car they knew was polite idled below and did not honk because honking had been disciplined into a class signifier and discipline is a form of love we offer power when we are tired. Evan did not give the drawer a reassuring pat because he would not patronize the thing that had become, however temporarily, the most useful technology he owned. He put his palms flat and did not press and waited to see if the wood would do the thing wood does when it becomes a screen, when you can look through it and see your own face and recognize the person in that face as a citizen of an era he had refused to join until the era had sat down at his table and asked him for sugar.\n\nKass came first, not quite out of breath, but wearing the face that people wear when they have run for five minutes in shoes designed for rooms and must pretend they were always gliding. She did not knock like a policeman or a cousin; she knocked like a woman who had learned the ritual of announcing herself and not alarming detectives. Creel followed and stood a pace behind her as if observing an art practice, as if she were about to ask questions about process and influence, and her scarf today had small squares like windows and he hated that he noticed because noticing had become a confession. They looked at the drawer with professional manners, which is to say they did not look at it at all.\n\n\u201cWhat did you take,\u201d Creel asked, and she used the softest preterite because sympathy, in the mouths of Ministers, is always set in the past tense.\n\n\u201cWe took nothing,\u201d June answered before Evan could find the line in himself he wanted to deliver, and her voice was water at the lip of a dam, even, depressurized, convincing because it was true. \u201cThe route removed itself from a thing it had no business being attached to. If you built a stage without stairs, that\u2019s on you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t on us,\u201d Kass said, and then she shut her mouth as if she had put her thumb on a vein and found it too eager, and Creel did not correct her because Kass had done them the favor of sounding human and not harmonized. Mina made a noise that could be taken for a cough if you wanted to be courteous and an insult if you did not, and she put the kettle back on the stove without asking anyone whether anyone wanted anything.\n\n\u201cI am supposed to ask you to accompany us,\u201d Creel said, and she put her hands in her pockets so he could not see whether the callus had changed since morning. \u201cI am supposed to tell you that it is safe. I am supposed to say that this is for all our benefit.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour words want to be furniture,\u201d Evan said. He did not raise his voice and he did not let it be clever and he did not perform anything resembling courage. \u201cYou put them in rooms and hope people will sit on them and call it a home. I do not live in your house.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t ask you to,\u201d Creel said, and he almost liked her for the lie. \u201cWe ask you to let us look at your chairs.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not his chairs,\u201d Mina said, and she moved to a place between Creel and the desk that was not quite a barricade because Mina did not mistake herself for furniture. \u201cThey belong to the city. He keeps them for us because the city asked his father to keep them and then forgot how to ask in a decent way and now you come in with your grammar and ask us to be polite while you translate it.\u201d\n\nKass had the air of a person who disagrees at a molecular level and also knows she will be fired if her molecules show. \u201cHe did something,\u201d she said, and she wasn\u2019t accusing him so much as making a note she could file under Her Own Name for later. \u201cIt didn\u2019t move the walls. It moved the ways. I don\u2019t know how to fight a person who moves ways. I only know how to stand in a path and then get out of it when ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can try standing in a habit,\u201d June suggested, and it was an old detective joke in a city where criminality had become administrative and order had become language. \u201cIt will bow around you if you are polite enough and if you are rude enough it will make a new river. I don\u2019t like either option, so I am rehearsing a third where I write down what people forget to say because they are busy obeying their own sentences.\u201d\n\nThey made a shape in the kitchen that had never existed in that room before: two women employed by a Ministry standing in the house of a man who had just altered the morning\u2019s architecture, a reporter holding a kettle that had not yet announced itself, a detective with her socks on wood and her pencil near paper, and a drawer of letters that now felt less like a container than like a weather system with a small, precisely drawn map taped to its lid. It was almost a family, the kind that meets at a hospital cafeteria near the gift shop and uses humor as an intravenous fluid. Evan thought of his father\u2019s hand making air-cursive, the way he had traced the idea of left-left-right-left until it could have steered a boat.\n\n\u201cWe have to go back,\u201d Creel said, and it was not a demand; it was a confession of the life she had, the one where walking back was the only walking there was. \u201cThey will ask us to say the word and we will say it and the door will do nothing and someone will get angry and ask us to say it louder. We will need a way to pretend something has been accomplished and then another way to pretend there was no need for accomplishment in the first place.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them your stairs are in a room that asked not to be walked on today,\u201d Mina said, and the cruelty of the line pleased her and she hated that the pleasure was available. \u201cTell them the people who wrote the ceremony forgot to give it a body.\u201d\n\nKass looked at Evan and did not speak, and the silence she made was more articulate than anything her Minister could have issued as a statement. He understood it, the way you understand someone on a bus who does not meet your eyes and then meets them for the half-beat it takes to establish you share a country. She wanted a word and not the word they had been trained to say and he could not give it to her because the word belonged in a room, not on a stage, not under a banner that had lost its verb.\n\nAfter they left, the building unclenched a notch and the window breathed and the banner outside completed its clumsy revolution so that the new message spelled itself with accidental tenderness: WE WILL NO CH OTHER, which read like the promise of a cramped future, cheaper and smaller and more companionable than any of them had planned, a vow to know each other as they became what they did not want to be and did not know how to avoid. Evan sat with the letters and did not touch them, and Mina opened a plum and gave half to June and half to him and kept none for herself as if she were practicing an asceticism that would keep her pure for some future she did not believe in.\n\n\u201cYou will have to do it again,\u201d June said finally, and she did not say it like a strategist. \u201cThey will find routes we didn\u2019t see. They will build new ones out of our own feet. They will turn our errand paths into their processions. They always do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d he said, and the knowledge sat in his stomach like the wrong kind of medicine, helpful in principle and caustic in practice. \u201cI am trying to be a child who pushes a chair under a doorknob for a minute. I am not trying to be the person who invents a new door.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe letters did not pick you for modesty,\u201d Mina said, and she did not disguise the affection in the irony. \u201cThey picked you because you hoard rooms. You keep a drawer like some people keep pets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I have to feed it,\u201d he said, and the thought made him laugh and then stop laughing because there was an etiquette to ridiculousness and the drawer had earned the right not to be laughed at. \u201cI have to choose what routes to starve and which to leave alone. I do not want to starve anyone into stupidity. I only want to make a moment when someone who never has to hesitate will have to hesitate, and in that hesitation remember that we have been hesitating for years.\u201d\n\nHe slept badly and in small, mean slices that did not deserve the name sleep, and the letters came and went in those slices like streetlights beyond a train window. He dreamed of a library where the catalog drawers had emptied themselves onto the floor and the little rods that once kept the cards in order had become snakes that only ate punctuation, and when he woke he was irritated that his unconscious had tried to be helpful and failed to be original. In the second bad slice he dreamed of his father laughing at a joke neither of them had told yet and then turning his head to listen to someone else finishing it, and in the third he dreamed of a bird that was not a bird and a name that was not a name laid across a line of type like the hand that stops someone from signing an agreement they cannot possibly comprehend and are too tired not to.\n\nMorning tugged him up into itself like a babysitter with someplace else to be, and the windows were ordinary and the floorboards were indifferent and the kettle was bravely itself, and he had a hunger he understood as guilt and not as appetite. There were messages, because messages breed at night in a city that has forgotten how to sleep, and one was from a source Mina did not formally have, a nurse at a clinic near the river who had learned to use her hands to move people out of rooms quietly when certain men with badges and certain men without them decided to make their own furniture where none had been provided. The message said only that the Dome had gone still and then had moved again and that the Primarch had decided to perform a different scene in a different room and that the rearrangement had cost two guards a promotion and a woman with the wrong shoes her paycheck. The other message was from no one, which is to say it arrived with no address and no provenance and the exact cadence of a memo pinned to a corkboard with a black pin.\n\nIt said that there were certain routes that could not be interfered with without offending the river, and June read it over his shoulder and said aloud that this was the kind of metaphoric warning you give when you have learned to respect your own mysticism and refuse to be embarrassed by it. It said there were names he should not learn because once learned they would try to live in his house and would never take the trash out. It said, with a politeness that made him think of his father\u2019s generation of professors, that humility when wielded by the wrong person becomes a weapon, and he wrote the sentence in the margin of the letter that had been about spoons and told himself he was not, in fact, defacing a sacred thing but glossing a manual.\n\nHe did not hear from Eider in a way that would have satisfied him, no voice, no new agreement in his bones, no syllable wearing a mask. He heard, instead, the mouth-mouth sound of the city trying to find its lips after being slapped. The shop on the corner had relabeled the baskets where bags used to be kept and had called them Elsewhere because the owner had a sense of humor about his inability to get plastic and his refusal to fail at generosity, and Evan bought one and put the letters in it and felt both pathetic and practical and decided that these were, after all, the twin virtues of men who do not like war.\n\nWhen he stepped into the hallway with the basket on his arm he saw Kass on the landing above, and for a moment they faced one another like neighbors who have, after years of pretending, finally noticed that they share a wall. She did not reach for her lapel. She did not make the sign that would turn the corridor into protocol. She said, in the everyday voice of a woman in old shoes, that the Dome would move itself to another river today and then move back and that there would be a demonstration of patience to replace the demonstration of power, and then she asked if his kettle worked because hers did not and this was her third apartment in ten years and she would like, just once, to be able to boil water without asking a man across the hall for a favor.\n\nHe invited her in because there is a set of small courtesies you refuse to abandon when the big ones have been made obscene, and he made them all tea and watched the way Kass held the cup with both hands, one on the lip and one on the belly, and he cataloged it without deciding whether it made her Benedict Arnold or a woman with cold fingers. She did not look at the drawer and she did not say the word cradle and he liked her better for living for a minute outside the grammar of her job. She told a story about her grandmother and a gas stove in a country that had not wanted her grandmother and a policeman who had wanted to borrow her grandmother\u2019s scarf as a favor and had never returned it, and the story was so plainly told that he forgave it for banging the old pots in the old kitchen in his head.\n\nMina asked her, with a journalist\u2019s sideways, what it was like to stand next to a speech that wanted to be a mountain and discover it was a hill, and Kass said she could not answer because her mother had taught her not to discuss topography with reporters in kitchens, and they both laughed because women of their age had been taught too many lessons about kitchens and had complied with too few for anyone\u2019s comfort. June wrote nothing because sometimes the best way to gather a room is to deprive it of the sound of a pencil.\n\n\u201cTell me what you intend,\u201d Kass said finally, and she put the cup down like someone who knows the sound of ceramic on wood and respects it. \u201cNot from the vantage of a symbol, not from the vantage of one of your little generational meta-jokes about drawers, not even from the vantage of a son. From the vantage of a man who has found a tool. What job do you plan to do with it.\u201d\n\nHe could have made a fool\u2019s speech about justice and been forgiven because fools are always forgiven by history when they lose. He could have said nothing and been hated by both sides, which is a luxury if you let it be. He said instead that he intended to pull the routes out from under their rituals one by one until ceremony became embarrassing and that he would stop two minutes before he became a person who loved the embarrassment more than the relief, and when he finished Kass nodded the way people nod when they hear their own compromise spoken back at them. She did not tell him to be careful, because that is what you say to people who will die in the ordinary ways you fear. She told him to be quiet when quiet would hurt more and to be loud when loudness would make someone else retreat into their corner without shooting, and he wanted to give her some of the credit if they ever got to the day where there was credit to give.\n\nHe learned the body-language of the city in the week that followed like a freshman learning a new campus by walking between buildings at night. He learned to see the places where traffic had accustomed itself to certain left turns and to imagine what it would be like if left were corrected into not yet. He learned that trains were the bones of movement and that bones belonged to no Ministry, and he learned that if you touched a schedule in the right place with the right word you could make two cars arrive at once and then no cars arrive at all and the platform would become a church where people decided what they believed about their neighbors. He learned to step away from the temptation to remove routes to medicine and routes to rooms with cribs in them and routes to the courthouses where ordinary selfishness was still being adjudicated by tired men in clean shirts. He learned, in short, the liberal arts of sabotage and restraint.\n\nThe letters accompanied, and he stopped pretending they were ghosted by one person with a bird to his name and started reading them as a chorus that had learned to harmonize without being taught. A paragraph from the lazy-precise hand would be followed by an insert in a hand that had once been forced to write with its left because a teacher had believed in superstitions about Satan and the hand. The choruses disagreed about etiquette and agreed about time. They told him which days repeated and which days were new, they told him how to recognize the place in a sentence where the subject will lose its interest and the object will try to wriggle free, and they told him not to attempt anything on days when the light from the river came into the room in a stripe one hand wide, because that stripe was a superstition different from theirs and he should respect someone else\u2019s altar.\n\nJune stood at the window and watched the banners as if they were a pulse, and she watched the chalk on the sidewalk as if it were a language that would not be committed to paper, and she told him when to stop. Mina built a story that did not reveal the mechanism, and in doing so she rediscovered the meaning of the word responsibility, which had been used so many times by so many men to mean stand in the door until I am finished speaking that it had come to mean nothing at all. Kass came up the stairs with a grocery bag twice and pretended to be a woman with onions and not an emissary, and Creel paused at the corner and looked up at the window the way people look at apartments they have not been invited into and would like someday to write about as if they had.\n\nThe Primarch performed a kindness one evening that made the city forgive him for a full seven minutes, and Evan watched it and felt human against his will. He walked into a clinic where the elevator had been refusing to align its door with the floor for a week and he took the door with his hands and held it until the elevator sighed and gave in, and he stood there while women with sleeping babies and men with bandaged thumbs and a person whose gender Evan wished he had the courage not to notice slipped out and said thank you with the dry humor of the poor. If he had been that man only, if he had been only a person in a room with a door and a problem and two good hands, Evan would have built him a chair in his kitchen and served him tea and found a way to forgive the entire century for naming him with a title that made the tongue proud. He had to remember the banners. He had to remember the stairs. He had to remember his father\u2019s hand moving in the space above a table where no one was allowed to put elbows.\n\nOn the tenth day, when the routes they had removed had been replaced with improvised paths that made the city look like a person who had learned to walk again after a car accident, a letter arrived that had no envelope and no stamp and had been slid under the door by a person who had learned the art of not troubling floors. It told him to bring a thing to a room at a time when that room would be empty. It told him that the person who would meet him there had a pocket that rattled because of a coin that had crossed three countries and ten hands. It told him that if he heard the coin, he would know which route to take, and if he did not, he should go home and make tea and promise no one anything for eighteen hours and then forget he had promised and begin again.\n\nHe went because there are errands you do for your dead and errands you do for your living and errands you do for the part of yourself that you hope can be forgiven, and this felt like all three. June stayed because she was watching the weather in the letters, and Mina came because she had once followed a school bus to the wrong school by mistake and had discovered an entire neighborhood of faces she had not known belonged to her city and had been forgiven by a principal who had smelled of chalk and good jokes. He carried the Elsewhere basket like a joke so old it had become furniture. He listened in the hallway for a rattle and heard nine other sounds instead, all competently made, all designed to imitate normalcy with the innocent malice of children pretending to be adults at a tea party with tiny cups.\n\nThere was no coin. There was a room, and in it a table, and on it a bowl of fruit because the city had decided to sneeze at coincidence and be done with it. Kass was there and looked like a woman who had forgotten to brush her hair and had remembered to carry her keys, and Creel was not there and he was grateful because he did not want to be forgiven today. There was another person, and she wore earrings that had been made by hands that had once made snares, and she introduced herself not by name but by a fact: she had been a librarian at a place where people learned to read again after the floods and had taught them how to be kind to paper with wet hands.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll think I am Eider,\u201d she said, and she put her hands on either side of the bowl as if they needed to learn how to be near roundness without taking. \u201cI am not Eider. Eider is not a person or a bird. Eider is a hurt done to a bird and the name we gave the hurt so we could love it without losing ourselves in the apology. You can call me by my name if you must, but it will be wet in your mouth and you will spit in your own hand and I do not think you want that moment on your conscience.\u201d\n\nHe did not ask for her name because the drawer had cured him of certain kinds of hunger. He asked her, instead, what she wanted from him that he had not already given away in public by making men in suits circle back to find their way to microphones. She said she wanted him to go smaller, and his heart rose and then dropped like a small ride at a cheap fair.\n\n\u201cYou have a romance with stairs now,\u201d she told him, and she did not make it unkind because she could see he had been withholding romance from himself for years and had only let it out to graze when he discovered it could eat the legs of podiums. \u201cI want you to notice the way a form is filled. I want you to remove the route by which a man puts his name in a box without reading the sentence above the box. I want you to take the habit out of the hand that signs. I want the city to hesitate for two seconds every time a signature is asked. I want the ceremony of the number to become a thing people have to actually perform, not a thing their hand does while their mind is in the room with the nicest lamp.\u201d\n\nHe laughed because it was better than crying in front of a stranger and because crying in front of a librarian feels like an insult to the oldest kind of privacy. He said he could try and that he would hate himself and that he would love himself and that he would do it anyway and that he would stop if children did not get milk and if a woman did not get her test results and if a man did not get to see his brother in a room with a phone. She said she would help him draw maps with his eyes closed and he found he believed her because her earrings barely moved when she nodded and because he had become a man who took cues from jewelry when the world refused to speak plainly.\n\nIn the street, the banners had shed their insistence; the verbs were back and the pronouns were shy and the children had begun to draw their own words not because anyone had asked them to and not because a generous adult had bought them chalk in a moment of noblesse oblige, but because they had seen other children do it and felt the itch at the end of their wrists. He watched a boy write the word WAIT on a stoop and then sit on the letter A because it had a belly, and he felt something that was not pride and not joy and not victory and not relief but a small, precise gladness that belonged to no one and did not need to be administered by a Ministry.\n\nThat night, when the drawer hummed like a neighbor with a new washing machine in a building that trembles at the gaiety of appliances, when the radiator ticked the right music again, when the city lay down and got up and went elsewhere and came back, he put his hands flat and thanked nothing. It was not an American prayer and it was not a prayer from any of his grandparents\u2019 cupboards. It was a sentence without a verb that wanted it, and the wanting did most of the work. He slept as if a room had been made around him that had not been there before, not because someone had built it and given it to him, but because he had removed a path that led to him and thus had made a space no one could enter without first remembering he was a person and not an address.\n\nIn the morning, there were fewer numbers where numbers had once stood as if men at podiums had grown shy, and there were more names spoken aloud to cashiers because signing had become interesting and the act of asking had become a tiny theater. There were delays that did no harm and headaches that meant nothing and announcements that doubled themselves and then apologized with a trumpet. There were letters in the drawer that had started to smell like oranges and libraries and the inside of a new shoe. There were new instructions and new cautions and a penciled-in addition from a hand he had not seen before that said, in a tone that made him think of a mother making soup at a window, that the hardest thing about making room is leaving it unfilled, and that he should keep his chairs empty as long as he could bear it, and then, when he could not, he should fill them with bodies and not objects and he should let those bodies be bored.\n\nHe turned to June and said he would try, and she said they would watch him, and he turned to Mina and said he would fail, and she said she would write it down and later, if any of them remained, she would make it funny in a way that would not hurt anyone who did not deserve it. He touched the drawer like a man touching the doorstep of a house he knew he would not live in forever but could not imagine leaving, and outside the banner had been mended with tape that reflected light in a way that made the rip look like a design, and a girl with a cowlick and a lollipop dragged a piece of chalk across the sidewalk and wrote the word ROOM and drew a door and then wrote NO under the door and then crossed out the NO and wrote NOT YET in careful capitals that would have pleased a schoolteacher or a god.",

                              "content": "The morning after the word became a room, the city woke with a hangover of altered habits. People approached counters and looked down at the small sanctity of a box with a line under it and felt their hand hesitate in a way that was not protest and not obedience. Clerks developed a new posture that involved gentler pointing and an extra syllable on please. A woman at the registry of contracts pressed the pen toward a man who had signed that same form six winters running and watched him blink as if seeing his name for the first time, as if the embroidery his hand knew by heart had been unpicked in the night. Evan walked through the lobby with his Elsewhere basket like a man bringing bread to a very modest, very temperamental goddess, and he felt the Drawer in the marrow of the building like a seriousness. The habit of signature had been notched; it would take weeks to see if the notch became a tooth or a mercy.\n\nHe practiced small. He learned the weight of what his father had called the attention of objects, and he aimed that attention at a mall kiosk where a boy had been taught to flip phones with the proud despair of youth in economies like ours, and the boy felt himself reach for the word upgrade and decide, without knowing why, to say instead, Wait. He touched a laminated evacuation map in a day-care center with his mind as delicately as he would touch a sleeping infant\u2019s wrist, and he moved the red arrow that wanted so badly to mean YOU to a calmer place where the corridor it implied did not run toward the wrong door. He wrote nothing down for the Drawer that morning other than a single sentence on an old envelope: today I will not be tempted by stairs.\n\nJune took the new slowness of the city and made of it a surveillance she could live with. She stood three hours at the foot of the bridge that had been renamed and then renamed again and then left as an empty noun, and she watched the choreography that the apes had brought with them, the security habit of funneling and looping and shutting and opening that had so often turned into a kind of public music no one had wanted to learn. She called him at noon and spoke the way she spoke when she wanted his brain to hold still while she pinned a thought to it. They are practicing with us, she said. They are switching to thumbprints at the registry\u2014not because it is safer, because it isn\u2019t\u2014but because they want to rehearse something their bodies already understand. You got under their hand; they will try to make the hand into the entire law.\n\nMina took the slowness and went to see what people did with it. She returned with a story about a couple at the marriage office who had been about to sign and had stopped because the groom\u2019s hand had become shy and the bride\u2019s hand had become solemn, and the clerk had said, I know, and had found a joke that did not hurt anyone and then found the sentence that made them both laugh and then the groom had signed and the bride had signed and it felt like two people borrowing a word and making it theirs. Mina wanted to write this down and knew that to write it down in the old way would be to give someone in an office the idea of how to make it an advertisement, so she wrote it down instead in a notebook with the names removed and the verbs changed and the ratio of pronouns adjusted until the whole thing felt like a childhood memory she could test language against for honesty.\n\nCreel sent nothing that day, which was as eloquent as a bouquet, and Kass sent five colors of silence. In the afternoon, a woman with a lanyard and a laminated card that said ATTENDANT OF GESTURE took up a post by the city records desk and offered to demonstrate to citizens how to sign in a new way that would preserve the efficiency of the office while acknowledging the new abundance of feeling. She held their hands without touching them, and people submitted, and Evan had the pure unhelpful impulse to go home and remove the route by which lanyards acquired authority. He restrained himself because he was learning a terrible and necessary calculus: every route removed created, like a good edit, a breath and an opportunity for someone else to move into that new air. He wanted to choose who that someone else would be. He could not. That was the point of rooms, his father\u2019s voice said. You do not get to love only the people you invite in.\n\nIn the Drawer there was a letter with no salutation, which made it feel like instruction rather than kinship. It said, in a handwriting he thought might be his father\u2019s and might be the immaculate-untidy one he trusted when the nights were medicinal, that the next thing to practice was the pause between the form and the pen. You are excited by the moment the hand disobeys the habit, the letter scolded gently, and you are an enthusiast of sudden reversals because you were cross with yourself for years for loving small things too much and forgetting to love large things as if they were small. Slow yourself. Take the route that leads from box to name and unhook it at the elbow. People can still sign. They will merely have to locate their name rather than have it spring to meet their hand like a dog.\n\nHe tried. He stood with his palms on the old wood as if warming them at a fire and described, with the weak but persistent arrogance of a man who has begun to trust description as a lever, the exact micro-gesture that preceded signatures in offices this year: the way a person looks down and sees the line and the space and even without reading the sentence above\u2014the one about understanding and agreeing\u2014remembers the choreography and lowers the wrist and lets the pen do what pens are so eager to do. He asked the Drawer to make a little room right there, between seeing and lowering, and the Drawer obliged with the smallest adjustment, a quiet of attention, as if a very polite usher had placed a hand to the aisle and paused an impatient guest at the opera for the seven seconds the aria needed not to be ruined.\n\nIf the apes noticed, they were too formally courteous, at least in public, to admit it. The Primarch gave an interview with an old broadcaster who had chosen to age into irrelevance stubbornly rather than gracefully, and the Primarch wrapped his words around the shape of patience with an artistry that made Evan feel a complicated loyalty to language itself. We are learning your hesitations, Thale said, and if he had steepled his fingers like a cartoon villain Evan would have been able to hate him efficiently. We had thought hesitations were a sign of weakness and had been trained to move through them as a runner moves through a cramp. We see now that sometimes the pause is the door. We would like to be invited. He had that tender gravity he could deploy when he wanted to reach into the pockets of his detractors and leave sweets. He had learned pronouns the way other people learn carpentry. He made the old interviewer smile in a way that felt like a part of the city giving up, and Evan had to turn the sound down and put his head under the cold tap and remember to breathe in the part of his chest that, in another life, had been reserved for the patient worship of unnecessary facts.\n\nThat night he dreamed of his father\u2019s chalk, thick and square, leaving ghost on a green board long after the word had been erased, and he woke with a precise memory that made him sit up like a dog rising when it hears the train that brings its person. He had been nine. He had been sassed into silence by a teacher who believed in volume as an educational technology, and his father had taken him to the closed library on a Saturday and had held his hand out and said, Write your name for me, and he had written it with care not because he loved his name but because his father had asked him and he had loved that faithful old trick. His father had not praised the handwriting. He had said, You have just drawn a route to yourself. Later, other people will ask you to draw that route in rooms designed to reward certain routes and punish others. You will be tempted to be very good at drawing it under pressure. Learn another route to yourself now, please. Just in case. And he had laughed, and the laugh had been his best protection against humorless men for years afterward. Evan had drawn a house, and then, shyly, a drawer. He had drawn his father\u2019s hand. He had drawn a little arrow that pointed toward an empty space where the next thing would be and had written the word LATER with a triumphant child\u2019s cruelty toward future selves.\n\nJune brought him a tally with small, gritty categories. She kept lists the way her grandmother had kept beans and rice, reliable in emergencies, soothing when the price of meat rose and fell with political weather. Evictions delayed today, she wrote. Evictions canceled, she wrote, and put a zero next to it without mercy. Children\u2019s appointments missed by mistake; children\u2019s appointments remade the same day because a woman with the talent for contrition had called three numbers until someone said bring the child now. She had a category called Boredom Returned, and she put her pencil on the page and looked at him and said, You would suffer for the return of boredom if it came with no banners. Don\u2019t lie. He didn\u2019t. He hated himself for that honesty and then hated himself for the narcissism of it and then hated himself for being a man spending all his new dangerous energy on the correct distribution of hatred. He made tea and she wrote Boredom Returned: three\u2014that many?\u2014and then she crossed it out and wrote two, and the precinct of his mind that had studied her years ago like a new neighborhood knew that she had crossed it out not because she had been wrong but because she would not forgive boredom for being aspirational. Boredom would have to earn its citizenship back.\n\nMina wrote without writing. She walked and watched and stored sentences in a dry room of her skull. She had stopped reading public letters for two days because she kept wanting to hear her own voice in them and had a superstition about arrogance when the stakes were humiliating. She told him a story about a man in a suit outside a courthouse on a bench that had become a statement in the last decade. He had unfolded a paper with lines and provisions and sub-sections and then, delightfully, had been unable to find the sub-subsection he wanted to wield like a club because the Drawer had taken, for an hour, the route that made legalese move. This was dangerous and probably a sin and she had felt like cheering and then had stopped herself because cheering for a mischief against the law is a good way to recruit not law but chaos. We are sophisticates, she said dryly, and her mouth tasted the disappointment that comes when your own bedside jokes become your work.\n\nHe did not touch the Drawer for a day, because he needed to feel that the city could, as his father had taught him with unsentimental tenderness, self-correct. He watched the practice managers at the clinic put up arrows that circumvented the absent arrows, and he watched an old woman at the grocer write IOU in ancient-efficient script when the card reader refused to remember how numbers are supposed to move through wires, and he watched three children at the corner figure out a new chanting game because the old one had relied on the rhythm of the walkers on their block and that rhythm had been edited by a man sitting in a kitchen across the street, and he punished himself gently with this knowledge and made himself laugh at his own melodrama and then stopped because he had promised the Drawer he would not make laughter a defense. Humor is not armor, his father had once said in the tone of a man who uses humor in precisely the ways he is telling his son not to. Humor is a way to keep doors ajar.\n\nThe Ministry adapted gracefully in public and catastrophically in private. A note arrived in a white envelope with a bird that had been redrawn to look like a strategic device, and inside was a short poem in bureaucratic code that was clearly Creel\u2019s revenge on someone in an office who had sent her to say \u201ccradle\u201d at a door and had then berated her because the door had refused to be impressed. It said that certain levers were intoxications disguised as tasks and that the river moved not merely downward but outward and that her job had become to make sure people did not drown in their own language. He felt an indecent kinship with her, and he refused the feeling, because he would have to refuse much more pleasant feels later and might as well practice on the literate ones.\n\nMarshal Deems came in a crisp coat that compromised with the air only reluctantly. He sat not like a cop with legs thrown wide, he sat like a former friend of his mother who had attended wakes and weddings with a practiced kindness until kindness had been folded into policy, and he held his hat in his hands like a man who cannot be trusted with them when they are empty. You are making it hard to do the wrong thing quickly, he said genial and exhausted, and Evan felt the click of a trap that had been laid with the clean tools of men who thought ethics was a gym. Deems told a story about a floodplain where men had built houses because people always build houses where they would like rivers to be less themselves, and he told it the way his mother had told stories that were really advice: not naming names, not asking for secrets, reporting the weather. They have machines now, Deems said, not threatening and not not-threatening. The Primarch\u2019s engineers call them harmonizers because they have to pun to make themselves bearable. They make holes that want to eat holes. They seal habits. They will try to fit your room into their music. Keep your door closed until you can make them sit down and drink something. It was both a warning and an apology, and neither were sufficient and both would be in the ledger, and Evan nodded in the way men nod when their mouths have become municipal and their hearts remain private apartments inhabited by a few names with toothbrushes.\n\nHe began to notice a cost that was not metaphoric. He reached for the voice of his father saying rude in the British way about some shoddy piece of work, and the route to that voice had a skip in it as if the record had been left in a window and the sun had softened it. On the fourth morning, the face of his father in memory sat three inches to the left of where it had always sat, and that wrongness made him sweat in a way that felt like shame, not fear. He checked himself the way a man checks a tooth that suddenly belongs to a different mouth. He said aloud his father\u2019s full name and the secret name his aunt had once used for him because he had been a romantic in his youth and had laughed at himself for it and had never quite recovered from the embarrassment, and the face slid back into its usual chair and looked at him with a kindness that was impatient with self-pity. The letter with the immaculate-hasty hand anticipated him with infuriating thoroughness. You are moving routes, it said in a paragraph that had been added at the bottom in pencil and then written again with a stylus, which meant someone else in another decade in another room had found the same bruise. Memory is not an object; stop trying to pity it when it is not where you left it. It prefers paths. Give it time. If you find you cannot remember a name that matters, ask a woman in the room and she will remember it for you because women are forced by economies we do not choose to remember the names of things that other people drop. Feed them for this. It was the kind of tender misogyny his father had been capable of when he was tired, and the Drawer corrected the tone with a sentence added in the margin in a hand he did not know: or do not make your forgetting a woman\u2019s job; practice repair yourself.\n\nJune noticed something in her own hand that made her sit at the table and stare at the paper as if it had brought her news of a death. The habit of the capital R had gone on strike. Her wrist refused the flourish. She had to speak to it like a mother speaking to a child who has decided the shirt in the drawer is the wrong blue. She wrote her own name and then wrote her mother\u2019s and then her grandmother\u2019s and then she wrote a word that had kept her grandmother alive in a small town that had wished her dead for a season: respect. The R came back not because she bullied it but because she admitted that its absence had been the consequence of someone else\u2019s disobedience, not hers. She looked at Evan with an expression he had never seen and would remember when the story of the Drawer had been turned into a song and then into a movie and then into the thing you tell children to make them fall asleep. You cannot make routes go away, she said. You can only make them wait. Remember that when you get greedy and call it good.\n\nHe tested the word destroy like a man testing a tool he has learned to pick up without being in love with it. He took a clause in a municipal bulletin that would have made a certain overnight closure of a bridge into a pretext for kettling a hundred people into a tunnel and issuing statements about de-escalation and he unhooked the clause at its adverb. He did not erase. He let the words stand and took the route by which men with batons reached for the sentence without reading the sentence that came before. He felt the room hold back a breath and then let it out, and he heard the street behave itself with a small relief that he could not give himself entirely to because there is nothing more dangerous than a tool that makes good feelings. On the way home he saw the dumb cruelty that follows magic: a boy on a bike took a corner he ought not to have taken because the sign that had trained him had lost its voice for an hour and a tabby cat that had survived three winters in this alley did not survive this one. He stood with the boy and bought him milk and did not teach him anything and then went home and wrote on the old envelope that had become his personal scripture, Do not remove the little moralizing machines unless you have the bandwidth to stand on corner for an hour.\n\nThe Department of Harmony tried a raid and had to pretend afterward that what had happened was a visit to old friends. It was ugly because raids are humiliating to the raiders when they fail, and making a scene requires rhythm and they had none left. They brought a device with a harassed aura and new weld marks, a tube of steel with angry wires that made the air complain, and they set it on the floor of his hall and plugged it in as if they were attaching an IV to the building. The machine made an absence that had been narrated into power. The cabinet did not care. The door refused to coordinate with their silhouette. The men with wires in their ears looked at one another with the mutual pity of technicians asked to solve philosophy with pliers. June told one of them a joke she had learned at the precinct that only made sense in the other language of the city, the one cops used when they had to discuss situation without admitting they were humans, and he laughed reluctantly and then deliberately, and in the middle of his laugh she saw the kid he had been when he had stolen capos from her cousin\u2019s music store because he had wanted to teach himself mandolin and his mother had been tired and he had not been able to ask her for ten dollars. When you give a person a laugh they do not want you write your name on the inside of their throat. She did not want to own this man in that way. She breathed. Kass unplugged the device and stared at it as if it had betrayed her, and Creel said we will try again later with a brighter mind, and Evan said you should try again later on a different problem.\n\nKass waited after the others had removed their politeness from the stairs and told him in a voice she must have borrowed from her grandmother that the Primarch\u2019s people wanted their own Drawer and had built one out of contracts and salary schedules and the language of roads and had succeeded in making a cupboard with no shelves. They think words are objects, she said with something like pain, and you have learned that they are rooms, and they will keep throwing objects into their cabinet until the whole thing collapses and bruises five men you would rather remain unbruised because they are the only men in the room who are teaching their daughters how to carry their own keys. He did not tell her that he had loved a cabinet once, in a museum, a seventeenth-century piece with secret compartments where men had hidden jewels and love poems and drafts of new laws, and that he had cried in the gallery and had had to pretend it had been about the woodwork. He did not tell her that the Drawer had cured him of some old, private griefs that had nothing to do with apes and everything to do with custody. He told her to buy stronger tea and to change nothing about the way she held her cup.\n\nThere was a letter in the Drawer that was not a letter but a palimpsest. Words written in one hand had been washed and written over in another, and both were legible with different species of patience. The first hand had written a map that made sense only if you had lived in a building for ten years and had grown old with its habits: the way the elevator prefers one landing at two in the afternoon, the way a particular pipe hums like a tenor when the tenant above takes his bath, the way the mail slot breathes on windy days, the way the downstairs neighbor puts on her music when her daughter leaves because she cannot bear a quiet whose shape is the outline of a child. The second hand had drawn, on top of that domestic geography, a set of arrows that led downward without leaving, as if the Drawer could become stairs if asked properly and if the stairs could be used without your feet finding out that they were participating. Down, the palimpsest said, is not under. Down is after. To go after, remove the clause everyone agrees on. The sentence feels naked when you do this and will try to put on a different garment. Let it. It will choose something shabbier and more honest. Then open the third letter from the right in the bottom row and read the last word without making a sound. You will think someone has died. You will be wrong. You have no talent for being right in a new room; this is your charm and your doom.\n\nHe treated the letter like arsenic in a Victorian novel and tucked it back with exaggerated care. June saw and pretended only to have seen his hand and not his face, which she had learned not to inventory because it gave her too much jurisdiction. Mina had no idea what the palimpsest said, and she did not ask, and later, when people told the story of Mina\u2019s ethics to students who had grown up two generations past ethics, they would be mystified by the way she had preferred ignorance on purpose. She believed in secrecy the way certain men believe in sports: as a way to mark time.\n\nHe walked with a small, stupid hope to the archive where his father had worked in a life he had refused to visit for months after the funeral. It had become a chic event space in two years and a church in six and then a paper lab in nine, because the city has always been the few oldest things plus the new, and the lab kept hours as arbitrary as the river\u2019s. The young woman at the desk wore an apron with paste kisses on it and spoke like someone who had learned to keep a building alive with careful humidity. He said his father\u2019s name and she did not drop her shoulders; she merely changed her pronouns. She told him how they had learned to deacidify certain atrocities so they could be read without falling apart in the hand, and he taught himself to breathe into his throat, not his chest, to avoid embarrassing himself. She let him handle an old ledger with a list of names that had gotten children milk in a bad year and had gotten their mothers a reputation for being too political at church. He bent over the old ink and let the Drawer in him look for routes he could afford to take and routes he had better teach himself to ignore. He held the ledger and chose not to practice anything at all because the room where people had once drawn routes to themselves to be counted and saved was not his to curate. It belonged to the women whose grocery lists had become history without their time or consent.\n\nIn late afternoon, the Primarch attempted a music that did not end in marching. The band was good, and the crowd had hands, and the steps they made at the end of the melody were not towards any door Evan could take away. He let himself be moved and then forgave himself, because there are only so many rooms you can build in a day and he had discovered a pleasure that did no harm beyond the little private shame of acknowledging the gentleness of a person you are resisting. Thale stood small first and then grew, not in size but in the reach of his voice, and said, We will wait for you in rooms, and Evan had to swallow a cursed laugh, because that was his line. You stole it, he wanted to say. We all steal, the Drawer said in his marrow. Keep your receipts.\n\nThe days acquired a rhythm: remove a path and watch someone learn grace; leave a path and watch someone engineer cruelty; intervene when the habit turned into a cudgel; sit on his hands when a small suffering promised to buy a larger patience; make tea, make notes, make jokes, and then stop joking. He began to mark the city on a private map, routes he had softened and routes he had vowed never to touch. He put hospitals in a firm no and trains in a conditional maybe and the stairs to certain platforms in an absolute you do not meddle here even if a good story would result. He put the municipal building where marriages are recorded in a tender maybe on Thursdays only, because Thursday was a day men like his father make mistakes and women like his mother forgive they have made them.\n\nA letter in a foul mood arrived around midnight one night and chastised him in a voice that might have been Eider\u2019s or might have been the Drawer\u2019s disappointment at being used like a broom. You will be asked to remove clauses from laws, it said. You are not a miracle. If you remove the \u201cexcept in cases\u201d you will make a door that only bad men will know how to use because good men find doors embarrassing. You may remove routes from men in rooms with microphones. You may remove routes from stages. If you remove a clause from the law you will become a story about a monster told to children and you will have to write your own bedtime story for the rest of your life to sleep. It was a harshness he recognized. He had always wanted to be spoken to in the cold. His father had failed him by loving him too much, and this letter corrected the balance five degrees toward the sane.\n\nHe tried a thing that made him blush. He took the ring closure away from a police line for an hour and watched, through slotted shutters like a person who knows better than to indulge his taste for theater, as a crowd that had been designed to be kettled found itself in an accidental spiral and unspooled into strange alleys and sang songs not on the approved list and wrote in chalk on the backs of their own hands because the sidewalks were being washed by polite men with unpleasant vans. The line of cops looked at one another and then at the sergeant and then the sergeant looked at the sky and the sky looked back and said nothing, and afterward, on the news that is not news, people argued that it had been rehearsed and people argued that it had been an angel and people argued that it had been luck and no one said Cabinet except a woman in a back room who would be fired in a week for reasons that could be summarized as Not Understanding Her Job. He did not tell anyone he had made a tiny correction to a metal barricade by thinking at it with love. He did not boast. He had learned at last the taste of not telling a thing even to the person who sleeps on your couch when she has had a night, and the taste was apple pit and humility and he could not tell whether he liked it.\n\nHe found himself wanting to write the name again into the wood to feel the room bow. He did not. He wrote instead a list of places in the apartment where he would allow the Drawer to be fully itself without his mediation. He wrote, on the envelope near his father\u2019s watch, Leave the hall mirror alone because June uses it to argue with her face and if you take that route from her she will learn to get her dignity from a worse commodity. Leave the window latch alone because Mina sings to it and the latch has learned the song. Leave the radiator alone because the tics are the only clock we will keep when the others become famous for lying. He signed it with his name because he was practicing cooperation with himself. He placed the envelope under the letters, not as a directive but as a bargain.\n\nA child outside wrote NOW under the NOT YET and then, after a moment, drew a careful line through the ON and wrote AND above them in block capitals. The sidewalk taught grammar to the day. WE WILL AND NOT YET, the banner said, repaired with tape that had been made in a factory where a woman with small hands had learned to hate her manager and forgive him because he had a child who would not sleep and she had once had a child who had died and she wanted, against reason, to give him this one unearned mercy. Evan walked to the corner with his Elsewhere basket and bought onions because Kass had promised to come and borrow the kettle as a civilian and not as a harmonist, and he felt like a man shopping at the last market in a city that has outlawed markets for their subversive insistence on person-to-person debt.\n\nHe opened the Drawer at dusk with the quiet ceremony of someone folding a flag and took out a letter he had not yet dared to touch. The pale blue of it made the room look like his mother\u2019s last dress, and the stamp\u2019s absence of glue was suddenly a tenderness, a proof that no seal had been forced, that the letter had always been intended to be opened and closed with human fingers, not by machine. The hand was the lazy-immaculate one, the one that teased and refused and loved. It told him about a woman who had owned a shop by the river where men bought ribbon to tie things they had not the vocabulary to hold. It told him she had built a secret Drawer of her own with her ledger and her ink, and that when men came to take what she had she had removed, for a week, the route by which bows become knots and the city had had to learn intimacy without ligatures. He laughed, he cried, he looked for someone to share the image with and found himself unwilling to ruin it by making it public. He put the letter back and said his father\u2019s name to the wood. The apartment hummed with the sound of a building addressed for the first time by its owner by its proper title. The Drawer did not rattle. It slept like a cat on a warm machine.\n\nAt the end of that week, with the city in a new genus of confusion that had not yet learned to bite, with the songs they had learned to sing during seasons of choreographed marching refusing to fit the new tempo, with the Primarch performing a humility that made him the most dangerous kind of king, with the Ministry buying fruit in bulk and wondering why the city laughed when it saw oranges, Evan wrote a sentence in his own hand on paper that had been part of his father\u2019s life and folded it into the Drawer where it could be found later by someone whose patience he was trying on like a borrowed shirt. The sentence said, Leave the chairs empty as long as you can. When you cannot, seat bodies in them who will fall asleep and drool and wake embarrassed and ask for water. Do not put objects in chairs. Do not put levers in chairs. Do not sit in the chair you made until someone else tells you to. Then pretend you do not like chairs. Then tell the truth, but not to the room, to the door.\n\nHe did not expect an answer. He received none. He boiled water and watched the kettle fog the window in a square that explained, better than any letter, why a room is better than a wheel. He did not feel holy. He felt practical. He was tired. Mina snored on the couch into a pillow that had actually belonged to a chair and was now experimenting with being something else. June\u2019s pencil had dulled and she had, without ceremony, accepted a bright blue pen with a bad slogan from a pharmacy that no longer believed it could afford to be ethical in public. Kass\u2019s knock came at the appointed noise; the kettle performed; the drawer breathed; and the city did the only honest thing it knows how to do when it has been offered a new technology in a decade that claims to have outgrown technology, which is to say: it practiced.",
