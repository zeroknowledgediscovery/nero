     "novel_text": "The morning the email arrived, the mist clung to the River Exe like breath on a mirror. The cathedral bells were still sulking about last night\u2019s vespers and the gulls were arguing over the end of a pasty someone had abandoned on the quay. That was Exeter in June: too much sky, too much history, everything the colour of postcards and old coins. I liked it like that. I liked the quiet, the illusion that I could hear my own sentences forming before they even wanted to be written down.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d Imogen said, chalking the specials board at the caf\u00e9, squinting towards me like it might wander off.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d I said. \u201cThere was a fox fight under my window. Sounded like a violin saw losing an argument with a cat.\u201d\n\nShe snorted and flicked a strand of red hair off her forehead. \u201cFlat white?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease. And those almond croissants that pretend they\u2019re not actually cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to call your agent and make her buy them for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me last week all I need is fresh air and patience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say this with love, Rowan: Clemency is a menace.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe gets me paid,\u201d I said, and sat by the big window where the river pretended to know me and the students did not. I opened my laptop; the screen blinked, indignant, and told me there were thirty-two new emails, three of them from my mother, one from my bank, and one with a subject line I didn\u2019t understand even when I read it twice.\n\nBritain\u2019s Got Talent \u2013 Final Invitation.\n\nI thought it was a prank. Of course I did. I closed the lid and opened it again like the machine might correct itself if I made it yawn. The subject line persisted, as brazen as a busker on Fore Street. Imogen set down the flat white and the almond croissant and leaned in until I could smell the coffee and her shampoo.\n\n\u201cBad news?\u201d she said, too cheerful.\n\n\u201cPotentially good news. Unlikely news. Very 2010-YouTube news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a lot of adjectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to break the unwritten code and read an email in public.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be struck by lightning immediately.\u201d\n\nI clicked it open. The logo was there, red and blue and starry, and the greeting was formal in a way that made me sit up straighter. They referenced my audition months ago, the one I had nearly not gone to because my train had broken down near Taunton and I\u2019d had to get a lift in the back of a man\u2019s van that smelled of pine-scented cleaner and despair. They referenced the broadcast, the unexpected clip that had apparently gone viral because I told a story about my father and a blackbird in front of four judges who weren\u2019t expecting a story about my father and a blackbird. They wrote: We would be honoured if you would take part in the live final as our Judges\u2019 Wildcard.\n\nMy mouth worked before sound came out. \u201cThey want me,\u201d I said, a whisper to no one, and then louder: \u201cThey want me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Imogen said, craning her neck like a pole vaulter approaching the bar.\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d\n\nShe misheard. \u201cBritain\u2019s got salad?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh for\u2014 no. The show. The actual show.\u201d\n\nImogen put down the chalk. It rolled off the ledge and clattered onto the floor, a white scar on black tile. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you joking? You hate talent shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate them.\u201d I tasted the lie, buttery. \u201cI hate the idea of being judged like a particularly anxious sponge cake by people I\u2019ve never met.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you watch that year with the dog who balanced on a bicycle?\u201d\n\nI thought of the dog, I thought of its eyes, the way its owner had looked like he might burst into confetti. I had watched, of course. We all had. I had also watched the year a comedian came third place and then sold out a tour in under three hours. We love to scoff; we love to be surprised. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the opera singer. And the girl with the violin in flames.\u201d\n\nImogen took my wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re going to write something that makes them all cry and wash their faces with their sleeve ends in their living rooms like the nation at the end of a rainy war.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have sleeve ends anymore. We do hoodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re deflecting. Call your agent. And also tell your mother. Preferably in that order.\u201d\n\nSo I did. I took my coffee outside because I felt too restless to be contained by four walls and someone else\u2019s music. The sky was undecided. Pigeons performed whatever family drama pigeons perform. I phoned Clemency first, because I am occasionally a professional.\n\nShe answered on the third ring. \u201cRowan. If this is about the invoice I forwarded, I swear on my favourite silk scarf\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not. They want me for the final.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho does?\u201d\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d\n\nA significant pause crackled down the line, followed by the sound of a drawer slamming, a thought being pulled tight. \u201cWell. That\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it madness?\u201d I said. \u201cBe honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be honest in layers. Layer one: exposure. Layer two: the booking fee, which is not dreadful. Layer three: legal. We will look at the contract and we will scrawl upon it like eighteenth-century clerks with gout. Layer four: what is your stomach doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomersaults. Headstands. That thing you tried to teach me at the Christmas party where you jump and twist and land and pretend you didn\u2019t nearly die.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my real question. Why did you audition in the first place if you were going to be this much of a stoat about it when they said yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought they would say no,\u201d I said, surprising myself with the rawness of it. \u201cI went because I\u2026 because it was a dare.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom myself. From Devon in January. From a page that wouldn\u2019t fill itself. I wanted to do something that didn\u2019t feel like being buried alive under polite reviews.\u201d\n\nClemency exhaled. \u201cThen the answer is yes. We say yes. We make the best suit out of it that we can. You write a piece that fists the country and pulls it forward by the scruff into some\u2026 adequate consolation. And you don\u2019t look at the comments.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never look at the comments.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa. You look at the comments like a man peeking under a door for monsters. I\u2019ll call you in an hour. Send me the email.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d I paused. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll embarrass myself?\u201d\n\n\u201cDaily, darling. But never for the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nI rang off and phoned my mother and told her before she saw it on Facebook from Linda who lives down the road and collects porcelain hedgehogs. Mum cried a little, which is her honestly, and then said she would record it for Aunt Joy and could she come up to London and sit in the audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I said, already imagining her knitting something inappropriate during the ad breaks. \u201cIt might be complicated. There are forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you read?\u201d she said, the old worry under the new cheerfulness. \u201cNot the one about the divorce. Your uncle Nigel didn\u2019t understand that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo that one about the blackbird.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might do\u2026 something else,\u201d I said, because I was superstitious and because I had promised it to myself. \u201cSomething new.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to eat before you go on live television. I\u2019ll send you some of my flapjacks. They travel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a famine, Mum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey travel,\u201d she said, which is to say, this is love, accept it.\n\nAfter the calls, I walked. Past the Cathedral Green where teenagers lay in reckless formations like punctuation after exams. Past the second-hand bookshop that always smelled faintly of soup and tender embarrassment. Past the charity shop where in the window a mannequin wore a sequinned dress that had once had a story, probably involving a night with too much karaoke and the sort of dancing that leaves you grateful to be alive in the morning. Exeter is full of previously loved things. It makes a person think.\n\nI think that year had made me smaller. The book had not done badly, if you measured the success of a book by the number of paperbacks standing to attention in the Staff Picks section with a Post-it note that said: Beautiful! Good for Dad! or by the number of times a man in a fleece at a village fair told me he had read it on his Kindle and liked the bit with the cat. But there is a way in which the internet and the London parties and the rush of it all take your face and flatten it into a caricature you stop recognising. I had moved back to Exeter to remember the smell of yeast in the morning, the way the tide finally gives in, the quiet joy of writing something that only a few people might ever read and it not killing me.\n\nAnd then I had auditioned.\n\nIt was Ollie\u2019s fault; he runs the spoken-word night above the bicycle shop on Sidwell Street, the one with the dangerously uneven stair. He had said, \u201cDo something public for once,\u201d and I had said, \u201cYou\u2019re insufferable,\u201d and then I had found myself in a queue of people with tap shoes and dogs and an illusionist who tried to guess my PIN and got it wrong twice and then got it right, which I do not think about because it makes the back of my neck prickle. I told my blackbird story to the four judges and an audience who looked like they had been trained to enjoy things. The first judge said something about truth and the second judge asked if my father was watching which made me think about grief on television. The audience stood up, some of them, like men in churches who have forgotten the hymn but stand anyway because everyone else is standing. Somebody backstage hugged me. I went home and hid for a week.\n\nNow there was this email and my phone was a drum.\n\nBack at the flat, the foxes had retreated to wherever they retreat during God\u2019s sensible hours and the neighbour\u2019s baby had given up crying so completely I held my breath until I heard a small noise and could breathe again. My desk was in the window and from it I could see the top of the cathedral and, if I stood, the river lifting and lowering whatever driftwood it had persuaded into a relationship. I opened a new document on the laptop. The empty page was a mouth.\n\nI typed: What is the strangest thing you have ever believed about yourself, and who told you it was true?\n\nIt sat there, slightly ridiculous. It reminded me of the sort of questions teenagers scrawl on the covers of their maths books when they are meant to be doing equations. I deleted it and wrote: In Exeter, the swifts arrive in a rush as if somebody remembered to turn on a switch in the sky.\n\nThat was better. Not original in the way that makes people weep, but true. There is a way you can start something that tells a listener they may unclench their jaw because you will be kind. Or at least, you will not be needlessly cruel. I wrote for twenty minutes, and for twenty minutes I forgot the email and the judges and the country and my bank balance and the way you are always performing even as you pretend not to be.\n\nThe baby upstairs resumed the measurable, healthy crying of the well looked after. I made a sandwich. I made tea. I sent the email to Clemency. She sent back seven questions, each with two sub-clauses and the sort of bold-typed phrases that make a person grateful and itchy. I put my phone face down and forced myself to write another paragraph.\n\nAt two in the afternoon, there was a knock that sounded like a boy about to apologise for breaking a window. It was Ollie in a jacket with elbow patches and a grin that made me pity his students. He teaches English at the college and has the air of a man who will smuggle a poem into your pockets while you are busy buying chips.\n\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d he said, shoulders already shaping themselves into a story he would tell later.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is ridiculous and true.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to write about Exeter on national television? Because I swear to God, if you turn us into a rustic clich\u00e9 I will\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow a cream tea at me? Yes. Unhelpful. Also please don\u2019t. Scones stain.\u201d\n\nHe came in without asking because that\u2019s the sort of friend he is and sat at my table and looked at the blank document like it was a slow dog. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought\u2014 I think\u2014 something new. Something that\u2019s shaped like a conversation you might have with the version of yourself that stopped believing it could be anything at thirteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is simultaneously specific and vague.\u201d\n\n\u201cVague is a writer\u2019s tool.\u201d\n\n\u201cVague is what you use when you haven\u2019t got to the heart of it and you\u2019re scared you won\u2019t be able to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. Do you practice this? You should be a therapist and undercharge on purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d he said, softening. \u201cListen. I\u2019m pleased for you beyond reason. And I also want to ask if you\u2019re ready for the fact that people will not understand what you\u2019re doing and will shout at their televisions about you being a man who reads instead of a person who sings and then will go online and say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a man who reads instead of a person who sings my whole life. At least now there will be a costume.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of those micro-phones that fit over your ear and make you look like a secret agent borrowing your own face?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d I held my own ear as if measuring for something. \u201cDo you\u2026 want to listen?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo you reading? Yes. To you floundering? Also yes. I\u2019m a complex friend.\u201d\n\nI read him the swifts. I read him the thought about thirteen. I read him a paragraph about my grandfather\u2019s watch that had not yet found its purpose. He cried a little, because he is carefully constructed to appear gruff and is actually a puddle with eyebrows. When he had finished crying, he looked at me with the expression he wears when a student writes something that makes him feel like the world might not be such a tired machine after all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not finished,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not finished,\u201d he agreed, \u201cand it\u2019s still\u2026 it\u2019s a start that could be an ending. You often start like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think it\u2019s good?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s you. I think it\u2019s you doing the thing your mother calls showing off and your worst reviewer calls self-absorbed and your best reader calls home.\u201d\n\nWhen he left, the late light had begun to do that thing it does in June where it makes you feel like nothing is permitted to end. I wrote. I wrote until my wrist hurt and my shoulder clicked and the rented flat smelled faintly of ink because I had pulled out the old fountain pen to stop myself from checking my email. When I finally sat back, the paragraph about the watch had become a list of the things I had thought would measure me: exam results; first kisses; word counts; the number of cities I could convincingly pretend to belong to; the speed at which I could forgive people; the ease with which I could forgive myself. It wasn\u2019t a list that would win anything. It might be a list that could hold someone for three minutes while they waited for the adverts to end and dinner to not burn.\n\nClemency phoned at half six and told me the contract was mostly reasonable and the part about rights was not dreadful and that she would insist on a clause that allowed me to read a specific piece without alteration. \u201cAlso,\u201d she said, \u201cavoid any casual use of the word \u2018bugger\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI seldom use bugger casually,\u201d I said, which is true.\n\n\u201cAnd wear a jacket. Something that reminds people of their English teacher but less harried.\u201d\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be careful? I don\u2019t want to look like I am in costume as someone safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are safe. They will have pyro on stage. You are the opposite of pyro. That is your advantage.\u201d\n\nAfter I put down the phone, I went for another walk. I went up to the top of the hill where the allotments hold themselves quiet. A man was watering runner beans; he had that absorbed expression of someone who has been given a task and wants desperately to do it right. He glanced up and nodded as if to say: yes, we are all trying. A girl with a purple streak in her hair sat on the grass and blasted music that used to be called grime and is now called something else, because time forgets us so gently. I stood and watched the city be itself. You can go to London for the feeling that the whole world is happening at once like a party where you might miss the most important thing if you even blink. Exeter gives you the feeling that there is a book open on a table somewhere and you have time to read it and maybe pass it along.\n\nBack at the flat, I showered and put on a T-shirt that had survived longer than some friendships. I ate pasta and watched a quiz show where no one won more than a hundred pounds and still seemed delighted to have been on the television. I went to bed with my phone across the room like a child in time-out. I dreamt about being in a library where all the books were unlabelled and I had to guess which was mine by the weight.\n\nIn the morning, the mist burned clean off the river. I woke with a sentence stuck to my tongue like a seed. I reached for the notebook by the bed and wrote: You are not what you win.\n\nIt looked too obvious and also like the answer to a riddle I hadn\u2019t asked properly yet. The kettle complained itself into a bit of purpose. The email arrived from the show\u2019s producer with times and dress rehearsals and a reminder that there would be a meeting with the judges\u2019 team and would I be so good as to bring two options for my piece so their standards and practices department could have a moment to panic at leisure.\n\nI phoned my mother again and told her to please, please not tell anyone until the announcement was official. She agreed and then accidentally told Linda who told Aunt Joy who sent me a message that contained only a string of confetti emojis and a picture of her cat wearing a fascinator. I forwarded it to Imogen who wrote back: If the cat is available to stand in for you, that could be plan B.\n\nAt lunchtime, I took the train to Paignton and back for no reason other than the movement helps. The man opposite me ate a sausage roll slowly and then fell asleep with his mouth slightly open and I wanted to write him down, to put him in a story where he gets precisely what he wants and it is not a sausage roll. The carriage rocked. The windows did their best to show me the sea.\n\nWhen I got home, there was an envelope under my door with Ollie\u2019s handwriting. Inside it, there were three photos from the open-mic night last winter. In one of them, I am reading with my head tilted as if listening for something. In one, I am laughing at something someone else is saying and my shoulder is relaxed, which is so rare in photographs of me I put it on the fridge for my own reassurance. He\u2019d written on the back of the third: You are allowed to take up space without apologising. Also bring spare pens.\n\nThe second day after the email, I got a text that made the back of my neck heat up as if a small sun had rolled right behind me and waited. It wasn\u2019t from the show. It was from a number that I hadn\u2019t saved and yet recognised in a muscle deep enough I had to sit down.\n\nHeard a rumour. E x.\n\nE x was not a typo. It was Eliot Pike\u2019s way of performing his wit even with an initial. Eliot with one L and the o smoothed out like a pebble, a man who had once told me that \u2018Rowan Vale\u2019 sounded too much like a woodland and not enough like a person. He had been in my first workshop in London, the kind where everyone tries to hide their ambition under a cardigan. He had a laugh that made you feel like you\u2019d told the joke wrong. He had a way of owning the room that meant the room spent the rest of the day trying to get itself back. We had both applied for the same grant; he had got it and sent me a message that said: Hope there\u2019s a next time, which was to congratulations what margarine is to butter. We had both been shortlisted for the same prize; I had won; he had sent me a page-long letter about the things prizes cannot possibly measure which, at the time, I had thought magnanimous until someone pointed out the sting at the end where he had told me, gently, that my work was \u201cgood company for train journeys.\u201d\n\nThe rumour, I guessed, was my rumour.\n\nI put the phone on the table like you might put down something heavy you didn\u2019t mean to lift. And then I did the thing I had told Clemency I would not do. I typed his name into the search bar of the internet and watched it produce a small circus. There he was in a velvet jacket on a radio show. There he was in black and white, the darling of a magazine that still pretended it didn\u2019t read its own press releases. There was a post from a production assistant of a televised talent show, blurred faces in a corridor, captioned: This line-up is going to be ridiculous, accompanied by metadata that made my stomach feel like I had swallowed a hedgehog.\n\nIt would not be him, I told myself. He would not lower himself to stand on the same stage that dog had balanced a bicycle. Eliot would host an untelevised salon where the art would be too delicate to be broadcast. He would\u2014\n\nMy phone buzzed again. From Clemency this time, blessedly human. Call me when you can, she wrote. And nothing else. Not an emoji, not even a dot.\n\nI phoned. She answered at once. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything until I have said something,\u201d she said, which is a sentence that never means good news. \u201cAnd don\u2019t throw your phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d I looked at the phone in my hand the way a person looks at a dog that is about to bolt. \u201cClemency?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe show wants you. That hasn\u2019t changed. The show also wants to be television. Which means it has to be full of stories people can read while they are boiling pasta. One such story is: Rivalry. Historical bad blood. The return. You see where I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re about to say a name, aren\u2019t you.\u201d\n\nShe did. \u201cEliot Pike is also on the final. He is doing an \u2018experimental narrative performance\u2019. His words, not mine. He told the producers that he invented the genre of whatever you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems likely. He also invented the height of tables, the feeling of tasting fennel for the first time, and the concept of polite cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cRowan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied. \u201cI\u2019m not fine. How do we\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do nothing.\u201d She was the calm in my boat. \u201cYou write your piece. You dress like an adult. You do the thing you have to do to make yourself sleep at night. If you allow him into your head you will put him on stage with you. He does not deserve to be on stage with you unless he paid for the ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be easier for the show if he\u2019s the villain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be easier for everyone if we don\u2019t play along with anyone\u2019s plan to make you anything other than the man who talks about swifts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote something this morning,\u201d I said, and I told her the line from the notebook. There was a silence at the end of it like the silence you get at the top of a hill.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cGood. Put it on a Post-it. Stick it somewhere. Read it every time his name tries to colonise your mood.\u201d\n\nAfter we hung up, I sat at the desk and watched the river pull itself along. My chest had that buzz in it like a hive you are not exactly sure belongs to you. I could see the story unrolling in the papers: once-friends-at-odds, Devon vs. Dalston, two men with words in their mouths like teeth. I could see people picking sides, as if there were sides to pick, as if we were a football match and not two people pretending to be less fragile than we are. I could feel the tug\u2014perform the argument, take back the room that time he took, settle it finally in the place where you hope television might bear witness.\n\nI made tea. I ate an apple. I did not look at my phone. I opened the document and I read the swifts and the watch and the list and the line I had written in the morning. I cut a paragraph that was clever and cruel and would have gotten me a laugh and an email from my mother. I put in a sentence about my father\u2019s garden fork leaning against a shed through a decade of weather. I put in one about the exact sound of an audience holding its breath.\n\nI read it aloud. The room held me. My kitchen table, my plant that I had finally kept alive for more than a year, the chair with the scrape on the back from when I had moved in: they were the small and domestic audience that will tell you if you are lying. I do not think I was lying yet.\n\nThe next days were a blur of practice and emails and avoiding the part of the internet that wanted to tell me what to do with myself. Imogen brought me a cake with the Union Jack iced on top in a way that made it look like it had been run over by a bike. \u201cPatriotic,\u201d she said. \u201cSymbolic. Tastier than the actual Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not be eating sugar before a live television broadcast,\u201d I said, and then I ate two slices and gave the rest to the seagulls.\n\nOllie stood in my kitchen and clapped me between paragraphs. He threw a tea towel at my head when I got too solemn. He pretended to be each of the judges and said things like, \u201cTell me why you\u2019re doing this now,\u201d in a voice that verged on sinister and then laughed at his own acting. Clemency sent me pictures of jackets. My mother posted a picture of a cake tin to our family WhatsApp group and wrote: Practising. There was a breeze through the city that made the bunting flicker even where there was no bunting.\n\nOn the Friday before the Sunday of the final, I took the train to London. The carriage was crowded with bright children and tired parents and one man with a saxophone that did not, at any point, erupt into music. The fields unrolled like someone\u2019s idea of consolation. On my lap was a folder with two versions of a thing that could, if I stood right and breathed, carry me through three minutes and thirty seconds.\n\nAs the train pulled into Paddington, my phone buzzed again. A message from a number I had not saved because I know myself: Eliot. Good luck, it said, and below that, unkindly, the picture of a thumbs-up.\n\nI typed nothing in response. I put the phone in my pocket. I got off the train into a city that smelled of metal and late plans and held my bag tighter so I would not forget who it belonged to.\n\nIn the hotel room paid for by television, I watched myself in the mirror. You do not have to like him, I told the reflection. You don\u2019t even have to feel anything at all about him. You are allowed to feel everything else. I put on the jacket that made me look like a teacher and a cousin. I put the second version of the piece back in the folder and then took it out again and then put it back, which in the world of the undecided stands in for faith.\n\nI walked to a park near the studio and read under a plane tree while teenagers performed the ritual of pretending to be indifferent to each other and adults performed the ritual of thinking about not going back to work and then doing it anyway. On a bench, a man fed a small child banana slices and ate the ones that fell in his own lap like a person who has learned the economies of love. I breathed. I said hello to a dog in my head so that I would be the kind of person who says hello to a dog.\n\nWhen the call came to go into the studio for the technical rehearsal, I had already walked through the piece enough that my mouth knew where it was going. The stage swallowed me in that way stages do, the lights like warm fists, the seating rising, empty, like the promise of a storm. A person with a headset said my name to someone I could not see in a voice that meant we were now a show and not this day in my life. I stood on the taped cross on the floor and looked at the camera with its apathetic eye and tried not to imagine anyone hiding behind it, ready to judge and ready, too, to be kind if I gave them the instruction.\n\n\u201cSound check,\u201d a man said, and I said, \u201cExeter\u201d and \u201cswifts\u201d and \u201cblackbird,\u201d and the words hung there, audible even in this air that smelled of electricity and old plastic.\n\nOn a riser to my left, someone said, \u201cRowan. You look exactly the same,\u201d and I didn\u2019t have to turn to know who it was, though of course I did turn, because I am polite.\n\nEliot stood there in a black shirt that did not belong to any shop I could afford and trousers that looked like he had borrowed them from a dancer. He smiled in that way of his that meant: see me noticing you.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, the two words as lined up as I could make them.\n\nHe came down the steps, two at a time. \u201cI\u2019m glad they did the sensible thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes for a better narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they call it a \u2018package\u2019,\u201d I said, because I have a petty part that wanted him to hear me say their word with my mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ll try not to ruin their edit.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked at the same time, and then we both were quiet for a second and I thought of being nineteen and in a kitchen at a party where everyone is performing their cleverness and the single mercy is someone handing you a glass of water unironically.\n\n\u201cSomething honest,\u201d he said, which was his joke, and his not-joke. \u201cTry not to be sentimental,\u201d he added, lightly, like a man recommending a dessert.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you think that word means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know exactly what it means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you do. You domesticate feeling and take it for a walk on a lead.\u201d\n\nHe stood there, handsome and infuriating, and I felt the old doors in me shift. There it was, the invitation to fight inside his sentences. I shook my head like a man shaking rain from his ears. \u201cHave a good rehearsal,\u201d I said, and I meant it more than I wanted to.\n\nHe watched me walk to my tape mark. He clapped once, the sound swallowed by the empty room. The person with the headset said, \u201cFrom the top, please,\u201d and I breathed, because somewhere between Exeter and here I had decided to be the person who does not pretend they are not always breathing for the first time.\n\nYou are not what you win, I thought. You are not what you win. You are the man who will go home and write again. The technical cue light blinked. The time ticked down. I opened my mouth. And said what I had to say.The first run-through felt like taking a pulse in a hurricane. I knew where my breath went and where the jokes were, the small pockets of air where people might laugh and forgive me for letting them. I knew the cadence I wanted for the sentence about the watch, the place where I wanted to pause so the old man watering his runner beans could walk across the stage of other people\u2019s imaginations and take his time. On the empty seats a crew member had taped sheets of paper with names written in thick black marker, and reading to those names was like reading to ghosts who had bought their tickets early. A woman with a headset and the patient expression of a midwife leaned close to remind me that the red light meant yes and the floor edge meant no and that if the pyro went off for the dance troupe before me I would see the scorch marks and not to be alarmed because everything was under control. I thanked her as if she had personally invented control.\n\nAfterwards, Nisha from Standards and Practices took me aside to say, only slightly apologetically, that \u201cdamn\u201d was probably acceptable but we should lose \u201cbloody\u201d in the context of my grandfather\u2019s watch because they were keen on keeping the pre-watershed audience on our side. I told her that would be fine, and we stood for a moment looking at the taped X on the stage that was mine as if it were an ambiguous omen. She was kind in that unshowy way people are kind when their whole job is to prevent catastrophe without ever appearing on camera. When I told her I\u2019d once said \u201cbugger\u201d on local radio by accident and that the presenter had pretended he hadn\u2019t heard, she laughed, and it felt like the studio exhaled with us.\n\nThe green room was less green than I wanted, more beige and snack-coloured, bowls of crisps and grapes and chocolate bars making a low offer to every nervous system in the place. On one sofa, a magician practised shuffling with a deck so worn it looked like a family heirloom; next to him, a woman in a sequinned leotard folded herself into a shape that made everyone else sit up straighter out of respect. A child with a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy on his knee watched cartoons on a tablet with the sort of concentration that could have powered a small town, while his mother asked him, every four minutes, if he needed the toilet. A choir arrived late and breathed as one organism while their choirmaster held up his hands like a man holding back heavy machinery. Everyone had a ritual. Mine was to drink water and then drink more water and then put the bottle down and forget which bottle was mine and start again.\n\nEliot appeared, of course, in a sigh of other people\u2019s attention. He wore black in a way that suggested it cost more than my rent and had been steamed by someone with a postgraduate degree. He didn\u2019t look at me as he talked to his director, or he did but only in split-second glances that were a kind of currency. It was a relief, terrible and pure, the way you feel when you realise that a person you have been braced to hate is just another person navigating the snacks and the lighting gel and the producers who say things like, \u201cCan you give me that again but with even more sense of\u2026 stakes?\u201d I watched him rehearse a line in the corridor that I recognised from an event the year before where he\u2019d stood in front of an audience on a barge and told them about a man who mistook longing for taste. It was better now. He is, I have to admit, good at what he does. It made me love what I do harder.\n\nI escaped into a stairwell that smelled like dust and floor polish and texted Imogen a photograph of my shoes because they looked like a teacher\u2019s shoes in an advert for adulthood. She replied, immediately: You could hide a small dictionary in those. Also do you want me to send you a picture of the scones I made to keep my hands busy while you do something terrifying? I told her I did, and she sent me an image of three ambitious scones, one leaning slightly, all dusted with sugar like a blessing. The kindness of people who cannot get to a television studio but can get to an oven is not to be underestimated.\n\nBefore the dress rehearsal, there was a meeting with one of the judges\u2019 producers, a woman whose cardigan gave away nothing. She sat me down in a corner that had somehow been furnished like a quiet room and asked what I wanted people to know about me in three sentences or fewer. I told her I was from Devon and that I liked rivers and that I was sorry. She smiled and said, \u201cWe can work with Devon and rivers.\u201d Then she asked if I had a message. It is hard to be asked that question without wanting to become a sandwich board. I said something about not measuring joy in units they can sell you, and she made a note with a very nice pen and reminded me that if any of the judges asked about Eliot I could say I was excited to perform on the same night as someone I respect. I practised saying it and found it did not kill me.\n\nThe dress rehearsal taught me the precise length of three minutes and thirty seconds. It is not very long, and it is forever. They miked me up, the pale loop over my ear like the ghost of a fishhook, and checked the tape for my name a third time. The lighting operator walked me through the journey my face would take from shadow to clarity; he called it a build, and I watched the floor dots glow and then turn shy. It was impossible not to think of school plays and church halls and those charity gala nights in which I had leaned into a microphone that smelled of beer and begged it to behave. The director, a man with hair that looked exactly as expensive as his patience, asked if I would be happy to take one step left at the end of the second paragraph so the camera could find me. I said I would be happy to take one step left at any time if someone would simply tell me when to do it. He laughed, and someone in a booth said, \u201cCopy that,\u201d and for a second it felt like the most beautiful machine in the world.\n\nThe hotel they\u2019d put me in had a soft-focus view of a railway line and a coffee machine that made a sound like a distant cow. The bed was too large and too clean for me to sleep without suspicion, so I lay on top of the duvet reading the poem Eliot had published last month about a woman eating an orange in a train station. It was technically immaculate and emotionally unkind to everyone involved, including the orange. I put it down and picked up my own pages and changed a comma because the page wanted it and because changing things is a way the anxious make a shrine of control. When I turned off the light, the city hum sat outside the window like a cat I hadn\u2019t let in.\n\nIn the morning my mother phoned from a train that was both at Clapham Junction and nowhere at all. She told me Aunt Joy had bought a fascinator whose ambition outstripped its engineering and asked whether she was allowed to knit during the adverts. I told her that I loved her and that she had to promise, promise, not to accost any of the other contestants in the corridor and give them toffees from her bag. She said she could not promise it but would try. In the background I could hear the sound of Linda\u2019s travel mug clattering against something and a small explosion of laughter. I told them which queue to join and which line to say when the security guard asked who they were there for and wrote it out on a piece of paper as if they would have time to read my handwriting at the door.\n\nBack at the studio, David the stage manager handed me a mug of hot water with lemon and honey and informed me without preamble that he had done seventeen series and that in his experience the difference between the people who enjoyed themselves and the people who did not was not talent but the decision to enjoy themselves. He had eyes like the sky over Exeter when it had finally made up its mind to be kind and a pencil behind his ear that looked like an extra finger. He told me a story about a man who had frozen mid-song and then recovered by telling the audience he had imagined them in their underpants and found them disappointingly fashionable, and how the audience had loved him for the confession. \u201cIf you forget,\u201d he said, \u201ctell them. They love to be told the truth from people who look like you.\u201d\n\nAn hour before the live show, they took us to the stage for a last walk-through. From the wings I could see the seats filling, the audience learning their lines from the warm-up comic who stood on the stage like a minister at the altar of laughter and taught them to cheer when a hand went up and boo when a cue line suggested scandal. They practised clapping, which you would think the nation had already got the hang of, but it turns out we like to be told when and how to be enthusiastic if we suspect our enthusiasm might otherwise be inefficient. The judges took their seats to the sort of entrance music that says: you will tell stories about having been in the presence of this personality. The camera swooped; the floor thrummed. Someone brushed powder along my forehead and asked me questions I couldn\u2019t hear because my heart had turned itself up to be heard over my head.\n\nI saw my mother. It was not likely, and it was also inevitable. She was in row H, wearing a cardigan that had been nice before she wore it to death and hair she had done herself with more optimism than technique. Aunt Joy\u2019s fascinator looked like the spaceship in a science-fiction film where the heroine keeps a diary. Next to them, a woman who might have been Linda or a saint waved at me with a handkerchief she had probably brought in case anyone cried. When my mother saw me seeing her she did that thing she has done since I was five years old, where she made a face that included the whole story of my existence in one expression and then made a small fist and pumped it as if we were at a football match and the team had finally learned to pass.\n\nI stood on the X when they told me to stand on the X. The noise of the room changed. It is a strange sound, the sound a crowd makes when it decides to listen as one person. The red light on the camera became a small, benign planet. The music dropped away and I could hear only the soles of my shoes on the floor and a man in the back row coughing the kind of cough that insists on its own innocence. The host said my name in the shape the nation had decided to give it. The applause came and went like a tide. Somewhere, thousands of people adjusted themselves on sofas, picked a bit of dinner from a plate, looked at me without looking at me. I breathed.\n\nI said: In Exeter, the swifts arrive in a rush as if somebody remembered to flick the switch and turn on the sky, and you can feel the city notice. People don\u2019t look up enough, but they do that day. You can hear it, the noticing, the way we hear the bin lorry, the way we hear the person we love coming up the stairs and, even before they put the key in the door, we prepare our faces to be kind.\n\nI told them the thing I had to tell them about being thirteen and believing the worst thing I could be was not clever but ordinary, and no one thought to correct me because it sounded like a kind of ambition. I said that if you asked me to list the things that had measured me I could give you a catalogue that would make your fingers ache: test scores, library cards, the number of times I could hold a person\u2019s eye without looking away, the ages at which I gave things up and the ages at which I learned to pick them back up without apologising. People smiled in the front row in that way people do when their faces remember a room they used to be in.\n\nI told them about my grandfather\u2019s watch leaning in a drawer for a decade because I was afraid to wind it. I told them about my father\u2019s garden fork standing against the shed through weather so attentive it grew us into whatever we had managed to be. I told them about a blackbird because if you\u2019re given a stage this large you might as well bring someone you love with you. He used to sing into our kitchen like he was on a mission to improve the boiling of potatoes and we, stupidly, thought he would be available forever. I said the word father once and felt the room hold itself like a pan lifted off the boil and then set gently back down.\n\nI said, You are not what you win. You are not what you fail to win. You are not even, on the worst days, what the worst person thinks of you when they are having their worst day. You are the person who, quietly, without permission, grows a life like ivy along a fence you didn\u2019t know you wanted until it was there. You are the person who writes a list of small mercies and then reads it twice, out loud, in a kitchen, to a plant that has decided to live. This is not a trick and it is not an apology. It is the opposite of a trick. It is the cupboard we keep the good mugs in. It is ordinary, which is to say, it will save us.\n\nI finished at the place where the piece finished, a place it had chosen for itself, and the build on the lights did what it had promised. For a second that was so dense it felt like a physical object, there was nothing, no sound but the metal of the rig cooling and the microscopic shift of a hundred postures. Then the audience did the thing audiences do with relief and clapping and the occasional involuntary noise that comes out of a person when they have to. The host walked in from the wings with that balance of sincerity and performance he keeps in his pocket. I remembered to step left, and the camera found me like a bird landing exactly where it means to. Someone in row H stood up too quickly and then sat down again with their whole body in a blush.\n\nThe judges made their noises. The comedian judge said he had not planned to cry on a Sunday but that at least the nation would not mistake him for a statue, and he made a joke about his mascara that made everyone love him more. The music judge said my piece was a song without music and that her mother would phone her immediately to tell her I reminded her of someone whose name I did not catch. The impresario judge, whose teeth could have lit a minor motorway, said that I had a gift for making the small things large and the large things small, which is not what art is supposed to do and also exactly what it does when it is behaving. The fourth judge, who has won awards for being sensible in public, told me that she had written down a line and that she would not say which one because private things are allowed on television if you decide they are. I thanked them in the order I had been told to thank them and did not try to be clever because cleverness is shy in this kind of light and runs away if you make eye contact.\n\nBackstage, the man with the lemon and honey put the mug back into my hand and said, \u201cThat went,\u201d and I could not disagree. I had a spasm of shaking that was not fit for the camera and hid behind a curtain that had seen too much to judge me. Someone from digital content asked if they could film a clip of me giving advice to my younger self and I said later, which is a thing I have learned to say only recently. My phone did what it always does when I am briefly visible to more people than usual; it filliped with messages like a fish in a net. I did not look. Clemency arrived in a gust of perfume and relief and told me not to look at anything not wearing a nametag.\n\nEliot touched my elbow. He had watched from the wings and he was good enough to wait until my face had come back. He said, \u201cI liked the line about the cupboard,\u201d and it was the kindest thing he had said to me in five years and I wanted both to bite him and to tell him it was about my mother and the mugs she will not allow anybody else to wash. He was already moving away, his body adjusting itself for the camera\u2019s appetite. In the distance, his own set waited, all angles and blackness and a chair with more meaning than chairs generally have. I went to sit in the green room and shared crisps with the child ventriloquist while his dummy practised blinking. The acrobat cracked her back like a brief thunderclap and told me that nerves were proof of respect. The choir sang a quiet G under their breath like a hymn for people in corridors.\n\nWatching Eliot from the monitor is a dangerous sport if your heart has already done enough work for the week. He did what he does, which is make language into a knife that somehow, when it cuts you, reveals something you had wanted to see. He leaned on a sentence as if it were furniture. He talked about hunger and fashion and a photograph of himself at nineteen that he had kept in a drawer for when he needed to remember what not to do. He was merciless, including to the version of himself he brought out like evidence. The audience laughed when he asked them to and sighed when he permitted it, and I hated every second that I admired him. When he finished, the room made a noise as if it had discovered a brand-new way to agree about something.\n\nIf there was a narrative, it had improved itself in the edit. The host threw to an advert break with the speed of a man catching a falling plate. I could feel the nation stand up and collect bowls and have opinions. The part of me that is a medieval peasant looked for portents in the signs, counted the cheers, measured the humidity, watched the tiny rain that was confetti from the dance troupe floating down through lights to stick to the taped X on the stage like snow that had gone to finishing school. The part of me that is a person tried to remember the train back to Exeter and whether I had left the heating set to reasonable.\n\nBetween the live performances and the voting come the interviews that look spontaneous and smell of planning. In ours the host asked if we were friends and we did the thing where we laughed and said we respected each other\u2019s work and kept our bodies still and behaved like adults. Eliot made a quip about how television loves to pretend people live in binary and the audience clapped at the word pretend because it sounded like a commentary without requiring them to do anything about it. The camera moved on. The band played a song from a decade I do not feel old enough to call a decade. The crew rearranged the stage to make room for a man who would juggle knives and grief.\n\nBy the time the voting closed, I was so clean of expectation I could almost feel the aftertaste of it, the way you taste garlic the next day because it has colonised you in a pleasant way. I sat shoulder to shoulder with a boy who had stilt-walked in a suit that made him look like a friendly Greek god and held his hand because his mother asked me to. I ran into my own mother in a corridor because the universe will give you what you love when it can and because security are wonderful but cannot entirely contain Aunt Joy when she is wearing a hat that could guide sea traffic. They had found the free water and a marshal who used to live in Ottery St Mary had said something that had made my mother decide he would come to Christmas. She pressed a gift into my pocket, something wrapped in kitchen towel and warm like it had been next to her skin. Later, in the half-light of backstage, I unwrapped it and found one of her flapjacks, the top shiny with syrup, and I bit into it in front of a woman from makeup who said, \u201cOh, love,\u201d like a blessing.\n\nWe went back to the stage for the announcement. The lights did their thousand-eye thing and the floor gleamed and the host said words that became only rhythm because we had all forgotten our native tongue and had replaced it with this one. The finalists stood in a line like a new sort of choir. I could see the drummer for the house band chewing gum as if he were trying to bring the heart rate of the whole building down by a fraction. The host read out names and people stepped forward and the audience did what it had been taught. Eliot\u2019s profile, viewed sideways, looked like a statue of a man making a sensible point. I had the sudden distinct impression that, whatever happened, I would sleep and not wake up inside a verdict. Maybe it was only the flapjack talking. Maybe it was the sentence I had taped to the inside of my skull. Maybe it was that Exeter had come with me after all, swifts humming over the river, the Cathedral bells sulking, Imogen chalking a specials board as if she could boss the day into being good.\n\nWhen the red light blinked its important blink and the host took a breath that promised everyone a memory, I looked into the camera and thought of the cupboard with the good mugs in it and the person I had been who did not know you could choose to be kind to him. The hand came down on the envelope like a gavel on a mercy. The room drew its breath in with the theatre of a storm. I stood where I had been told to stand and, quietly, made myself ready to go home and write again.They said a name that was not mine and I felt, with a clarity almost medical, something inside me sit down. The lights did their theatre and the room made the sound that rooms make when they choose a story to keep, and all of it was both enormous and very far away, like thunder on the other side of a valley. I clapped for the boy with the voice that had made the balcony vibrate; I clapped for the choir who had made something communal out of breath; I clapped, with a kind of relieved ferocity, because my hands knew what to do while the rest of me recalibrated. There was a camera in my face for the \u201creaction,\u201d and I arranged mine like crockery on a draining board: sincere, not tragic, usable. Somewhere to my left, Eliot put on the expression that has seen him through prize nights and bad wine, and the host said things about journeys and how far we had all come, and I remembered suddenly, stupidly, the train from Taunton and the smell of pine cleaner and despair in the back of a van.\n\nThey herded us off with admirable efficiency, as if handling a flock that had to be got to a gate before the weather turned. In the corridor, the music sounded like it was being played down a metal tube; in the green room, it sounded like nothing at all because everybody was too busy swallowing. The child with the ventriloquist\u2019s dummy asked me if I was famous now, and I said I was famous for at least the duration of a bus ride, which made his mother laugh into her sleeve like a person who had been waiting for permission to. Clemency appeared with her arms already out and her phone already full, and she kissed my cheek and told me she was maternal with pride and allergic to disappointment and that my mentions would be a small bonfire we would not stand too close to. She gave me the wrap-up: trending, the judges had been kind, there was a producer from a radio programme who wanted me the next week, and a stranger had emailed her to say I had made him stop drinking straight out of the saucepan and get a glass.\n\nMy mother found me despite every barrier designed to keep mothers from finding their sons in television buildings. She had acquired a lanyard by smiling at a person who did not know how to deal with a woman who thanked him for his service as though he were returning from a mission. Aunt Joy\u2019s fascinator had slid imperceptibly to port and the effect was of a ship that had seen something extraordinary on the horizon and leaned towards it. They were incandescent with the kind of joy that only partly requires facts. My mother put both her hands on my face and said, \u201cYou were beautiful,\u201d which is a thing it is very hard to hear at any age and not become briefly three years old. Aunt Joy declared, with the certainty of someone whose entire experience of showbusiness had just occurred, that the nation had fallen in love with me and could do what it liked about it.\n\nEliot and I crossed paths by the precious water cooler, that diplomatic zone where every emotion has to take off its shoes. He looked exactly like a man who had been very nearly turned into a story and had only partly enjoyed the sensation. For once his precision wobbled and I could see the person under the press cuttings, a man with a habit of wrinkling his nose when he was thinking hard. He said, \u201cYou were very good,\u201d in a tone that was almost ordinary, and I said, \u201cYou were too,\u201d and for the first time since the barge, neither of us tried to make the compliment into a competition. It felt like someone had unthreaded a wire that had been tightened between us for so long we had forgotten it was there. Then a runner asked him to stand under a light and say something about the experience of the experience, and he was gone, unblinking in the new sun of attention.\n\nBy the time I had been collected, debriefed, congratulated and handed a tote bag with a bottle of something non-alcoholic and a T-shirt that was never going to suit me, the backstage had begun to empty of its adrenaline. A technician in a hoodie coiled cables as if they were snakes he had tamed with kindness. The floor was confettied with the evidence of other people\u2019s moments: a broken sequin, a sentence dropped like a feather, the skid mark of a heel that had tried to stop history. David the stage manager passed me and tipped his pencil as if it were a hat and said, \u201cTold you\u2014decision,\u201d and I wanted to hug him and also go somewhere my name was elastic again. Clemency kissed me once more and murmured that she would ring at eleven and noon and three tomorrow and to sleep with my phone far enough away that I could not hear it sulking. My mother tried to give me a Tupperware of egg sandwiches she had smuggled into the capital like contraband; security looked at me, I looked at security, and we all conspired to believe we lived in a world where such things were legal.\n\nIn the hotel room, the railway line moved past as if it were the last thing still committed to speed. I put the tote bag on a chair as if it were a guest and took the jacket off with the careful movements of a person taking off a personality. The quiet after that much light is not quiet at all; it\u2019s a tide going out and pulling the bones of the day with it. I washed the make-up off my face and was briefly surprised to find my face underneath, and then I ate my mother\u2019s egg sandwich out of the Tupperware with the grave gratitude of a pilgrim. The phone jittered on the desk like a bird getting ready to take off. I turned it face down and stood at the window and imagined the Exeter night, the river not pretending anything, Imogen closing the caf\u00e9 with a flourish that had much more to do with her than with the till.\n\nI slept like a person who had promised himself that sleep was not a verdict. When I woke, the city had remembered it was Monday and got on with it. Trains arrived and departed with the righteous noise of things that have purpose. I packed in that desultory way you pack when your suitcase and your heart disagree about where home is. On the train, my mother and Aunt Joy took possession of a table as if seating plans were a suggestion rather than a law. Aunt Joy shared anecdotal feedback from the women in Row H\u2014Apparently I have an honest neck and a kind stance\u2014and my mother read to me in fragments from messages relatives had sent from various edges of the country. Linda cried on and off like a defective tap and kept passing me items from her bag that did not immediately strike me as snacks but turned out to be snacks. We watched out of the window as the capital became fields with intention, and then hills with opinions, and then the soft domesticity of Devon sidled in like a cat forgiving you.\n\nBack in Exeter, the air had that washed feeling it sometimes gets after a weekend when the whole city has been lent to visitors and then returned. Imogen was outside the caf\u00e9 chalking a list of scones that read like a shortlist for a small, well-judged prize. When she saw me, she did not shout in the way I know she had been waiting to, because we are not that kind of town, but she did clap with her hands below the board, which only the seagulls and I could see. She made me sit down before I could pretend I had to go home to unpack, and she made me drink a coffee like an antidote and eat something that did not announce itself as cake until it was halfway down. \u201cLook at you,\u201d she said, and there was the love in it that makes a person able to be looked at. \u201cYou didn\u2019t combust. You didn\u2019t say bugger. You remembered to put your mouth where your heart is.\u201d\n\nOllie arrived with a bag of pears that he clearly hadn\u2019t meant to buy and the air of a man who is ready to be disappointed if it will make a better story. He peered at me as if looking for scorch marks. \u201cHow famous are you?\u201d he asked, without preamble. \u201cOn a scale from person who gets recognised at the dump to person who cannot buy toilet roll without a minor incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am recognised by toddlers who fear I am about to be a bedtime story,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd by men in fleeces who want to tell me about their blackbirds.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said. \u201cContainable fame. The best kind. We run a night on Thursday and call it \u2018The Man Off The Telly Reads And Then Everybody Goes Home Before Ten.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe was joking, but the idea lodged in the sort of corner that collects useful fluff. The thought of reading above the bicycle shop where the stair threatens to remove your dignity every time you climb it felt like a cure for an infection I hadn\u2019t admitted I\u2019d caught. The studio had been a machine and a miracle; the bicycle shop would be splinters and condensation and the way people make space with their attention rather than with lights. I told him I would, if he promised to temper the poster, and he promised to do something that included only my initials and a very confused pigeon.\n\nOn Tuesday morning the emails arrived like weather. Clemency orchestrated them with the relish of a conductor discovering that the orchestra is larger than she thought. There were invites and offers and a press request that made me snort tea through my nose. A radio programme wanted me to talk about the craft of timing and whether sadness has a rhythm. A festival wanted a curated evening entitled Ordinary Things That Saved Us, which made me itch because salvation is a word that belongs to people who use it with care. A small publisher I love sent a message that read, simply, If there\u2019s a pamphlet in it, we will find the staples and the patience. There was a letter forwarded from the show addressed to \u201cThe Gentleman Poet,\u201d in the spindly blue biro of prison paper, which I left unopened on the table while I caught up with my breath, and then opened with that breath in my throat. It was from a man in Parc who wrote about how the sound of the swifts had made the undersides of his ribs feel like windows, and who asked if I might write him a list of small tasks to do with his hands that would not get him into trouble. I wrote back that afternoon and told him about peeling oranges with attention and counting the screws in a hinge and learning the names of the weeds nobody loves.\n\nIn the middle of the admin, a text arrived without the weighty trailer of any app. It was from a number I now no longer had to memorise to know what my stomach would do when I saw it. Nice line about the cupboard. E. There was no flourish, no baroque vocabulary. The message looked almost embarrassed to be itself. I stared at it long enough for the screen to dim and then brightened the screen with my thumb as if encouraging a shy animal. I wrote back: That orange poem was good work. R. It was not what I had to say, and it might be what it had to be for now.\n\nAfter lunch, after telling my mother twice that no, I was not being asked to be a judge on anything and no, I could not arrange for Linda\u2019s cat to be on the Christmas special, I took the old fountain pen out of its drawer. The watch sat there too, its face bleached a little by years of not being asked to help. I picked it up the way you pick up a friendship you have neglected, careful not to pretend you haven\u2019t. My thumb found the knurled crown and I wound it until I felt the resistance change from welcome to warning. The tick it made in my palm was the least theatrical sound I had heard all day and I wanted to cry for the way we pretend small ticks are not how we stay alive. I set it down on the desk where my laptop had been sulking and let them glare at each other like rivals in a nursery.\n\nIn the evening I walked down to the river. The swifts were showing off, because of course they were, because every lesson in the world comes with an encore if you look up. The cathedral had decided not to sulk and was busy being a place where people make promises in party clothes. Tourists leaned on the parapet and let the wind edit their hair. A boy with a skateboard practised a thing I do not know the name of and failed and failed and then landed it and allowed himself one soundless celebration, like a prayer. I stood there and did the very unfashionable act of being grateful without an audience. If a television studio is a forge, the river is a sink, and sometimes you have to stand over it and wash your hands properly.\n\nThursday came and with it the open mic and a queue that made the bicycle shop look like it had become briefly famous in a French film. People had seen the poster with my initials and the pigeon and had made the correct assumptions. Ollie had put a string of fairy lights around the mic stand which made it look like an apology. The room smelled of chain oil and malty bread and the sort of nerves that improve a thing. I went up the stairs like a man proving he still could. Imogen stood behind the bar with the seriousness of a priest serving sacrament and told people it would be over by ten because some of us have to get up and bake at five. When I stood up and the chairs creaked and the room made that little collective surrender that rooms make when they have decided to trust you, I felt, briefly and completely, at home.\n\nI didn\u2019t read the television piece. I read the second version I\u2019d put back in the folder, the one I hadn\u2019t needed on the night and had loved quietly anyway. It was about the taste of the air on the first day of school and the way new exercise books pretend they will save you. It was about the vocabulary of small repairs and the feeling of being forgiven in a hardware shop. It was about the smell of my father\u2019s jumper, which I still keep in a bag that once had apples in it, and about a woman on the train who broke a KitKat into four exactly equal fingers and passed the fourth to a stranger because it seemed like the law. People laughed in the places where I had left them room to and quieted so completely at the end that I could hear somebody\u2019s coat recollecting the rain. There was no judge, no red light, no build, no camera. There was a man in a bicycle helmet who took it off like a hat. There was a girl at the back who had been chewing her sleeve and who, when I was done, put her sleeve back into her mouth like a person who has remembered herself.\n\nAfter, a woman came up and told me she\u2019d brought her father because he didn\u2019t like poems but he did like handrails and she thought I might be a bridge. A boy with hair like nettles handed me a zine he\u2019d stapled on a bus and said that the line about forgiving yourself had made his throat feel like it had swallowed a lightbulb and he wasn\u2019t sure if that was good or not. Ollie pressed a bottle of beer into my hand and told me briskly not to get used to applause indoors because we don\u2019t have room for it and people need to get back to their bikes. I walked home the long way, along the perimeter of the park where people throw balls to dogs that have learned generosity as a sport, and when I got in I wound the watch again and it ticked at me as if to say: yes, again, yes.\n\nThe next week became a rhythm that, for once, did not make me feel like I was being dragged. Mornings at the desk with the river doing its unshowy work. A radio interview done under a duvet because the room was echoey and I wanted the nation to hear only my vowels and not my ceiling. Emails from people who had seen me on the television and now wanted to see me in rooms with walls, which is a better way to see another person. A letter from the prison that had the neat lines of a man learning patience in pen. Coffee with a woman from the small publisher who wore a brooch shaped like a question mark and said, over a plate of biscuits whose ambition outstripped their butter, that perhaps I had a pamphlet, and perhaps it should be called Kindness Will Not Save Us But We Could Try Being Kind Anyway, and I grinned so wide the caf\u00e9 felt obliged to grant us a table with better light.\n\nEliot phoned on a Thursday when the bin lorry had already done its music. He asked me, in a voice that made him sound like he had slept and not slept, if I wanted to do an event in London in a fortnight. The pitch was a conversation rather than a cage match; the venue was an old cinema with seats that had held very many hearts through very many films. \u201cWe could be grown-ups,\u201d he said, and it was both a promise and a dare. I thought of the wire between us and how it had been, suddenly, less taut. I thought of the part of me that is a medieval peasant and looks for omens in the tea leaves and the part of me that is a man who has learned to wind a watch and let it tick. I told him to send me the details and that I would ask Clemency to look at the contract so we would not accidentally sell our pasts to a drinks brand. He laughed, relieved, as if the negotiation were a language he was glad we shared, and when we hung up I stood at the window and watched a woman teach a toddler to kick a ball and wished all our lessons were conducted with that kind of weather.\n\nOn the day the pamphlet was agreed in principle, I went to the charity shop with the haunted sequinned dress and found, tucked into a pile of things that had once been vital to someone, a jacket that looked like the cousin of the one Clemency had made me wear. It had elbow patches and a smell that said its previous owner had not been unkind. I paid three pounds and the woman at the till told me that I was the man from the television and that her husband had held her hand through my piece without even looking, which was the politest thing he had done in a month. I wore the jacket out and went to the Cathedral Green and sat on the grass and wrote the first paragraph of something I did not yet have a name for, and thought: this is what it is to begin, again, and again.\n\nAt home, the post had one of those brown envelopes that make even the innocent feel guilty. It was from the show, a royalties statement that looked like a list of everything I didn\u2019t know about the world. Tucked inside was a printed photograph, glossy in that way that makes fingers leave proof of themselves, of me on the stage at the moment my mouth was closed and the light had not yet decided. Someone had written on the back, in a hand I did not recognise but trusted immediately, Thank you for making the small things large. Don\u2019t tell my boss, I cried during a light-check. I put it on the fridge next to the picture of my shoulder relaxed because it seemed right that my shoulder should have company.\n\nA week later, at the event in the old cinema, Eliot and I learned how to be near each other without taking something that was not offered. The chairs were misbehaving and the microphones had a static crackle like old stars confessing, and the audience were the kind of people who have learned to clap without being told when to. We spoke about the difference between performance and hospitality and how sometimes the worst thing you can do to a feeling is put a bow on it. He said something generous about the way my work invites people to be better to themselves, and I said something true about the way his refuses to let anyone, including him, keep their comfortable lies. There were laughs and there were sighs and there were a few weaponised questions from the floor which we parried not with swords but with small domestic tools. In the bar after, he stood with his back to a poster for an old war film and told me that when he was nineteen he had wanted to be applauded for his cruelty and now he wanted to be applauded for his mercy and he was finding the second applause harder to earn. I told him mercy is harder to perform without props. We were quiet for a moment like men waiting for a kettle to click, and then he asked if I liked fennel yet and I told him I was trying.\n\nOn the train back that night, the carriage was full of people who had been to a different event involving sweat and lights and who were carrying their glitter home on their shoulders like a harmless contagion. I took the fountain pen out and wrote a list of the next small things I could do that would add up to a life: buy stamps; write back to the man in Parc; go to the allotments with tea in a flask and ask the man with the runner beans if he needed a hand; take my mother to the sea and let her point at boats and invent their biographies. At Tiverton Parkway, a man got on with a bag full of mushrooms and the certainty of his own intentions. The night outside the window was black and full and asked nothing of me but to arrive while it existed.\n\nWhen I stepped through my own front door, the flat patted itself to show me everything was where I had left it. The plant I had not killed drew its leaves in like a person shivering dramatically for effect. The watch on the desk ticked with the kind of optimism that pretends to be ordinary. I put the new jacket on the back of the chair and the old jacket in the wardrobe and the photograph on the fridge under a magnet shaped like a sardine. Before bed, I set the alarm and then set the alarm inside my head, the one that says: when the mist is on the river, go and look. I slept and dreamt about a cupboard full of mugs none of which matched and all of which insisted on being exactly themselves, and in the morning the bells did not sulk at all. They sang like they had always known we were listening.Chapter Five\n\nThe week turned itself like a pillow and came up cool on the other side. Exeter changed gear without checking its mirrors and suddenly we were halfway to July and the evenings pretended they had no curfew. I woke to the sound of gulls who had discovered a new way to disagree about bread, and the cathedral, moody as a teenager asked to empty the dishwasher, decided she might forgive us today. There is a particular blue the river keeps for mornings when you needed to be told you can start again; it\u2019s the colour of metal left out in kindness. I made tea and, because I have decided to behave like a person who owns his own life, I did not look at my phone until after the kettle had spoken twice.\n\nClemency sent a schedule in which my name looked like it had got on the wrong train. There was a daytime radio slot that would require my best vowels at an hour when my face still believes in darkness, and a meeting at the small publisher with the brooch in the shape of a question mark. She\u2019d typed, with the smug affection of a woman who has shepherded worse beasts than me, that she had said no to two brand \u201copportunities,\u201d one involving an insurance company\u2019s campaign about braver home contents and one involving a cereal bar. \u201cIf you need more fibre,\u201d she added, \u201cwe can attend to that without money changing hands.\u201d I sent her a photograph of my porridge as tribute and she replied with a thumbnail of her shoes, which is her way of reminding me she is very good at walking briskly towards my better interests.\n\nOn Wednesday the school wrote, the one where I had sat through assemblies about road safety that made death sound both efficient and moral. The email came via a woman called Dawn with decades of competence in her sentences and an attachment called \u201cSpeechDayRunningOrderFINALFINAL2.docx.\u201d They were short of someone who could tell a roomful of teenagers that life had a shape without lying to them. Would I speak for seven minutes about writing and not giving up and, possibly, resilience, but only if I actually meant it. I read the word \u201cresilience\u201d and pictured a shop selling \u201cResilience!\u201d in small boxes next to the till. I wrote back that I would say what I could say without causing anyone to doze upright. Dawn replied within ten minutes with three exclamation marks and a line about biscuits. I put the date in my calendar and touched wood and my pocket and the top of the doorframe on my way out of the kitchen because superstition is, for me, a form of stretching.\n\nThe publisher\u2019s office was the sort of small room in which it is possible to believe you could make a book with your hands. There were boxes that looked heavy in a way that makes you want to be useful, and a potted plant that was thriving out of sheer bloody-mindedness. The woman with the brooch, whose name I really ought to have asked the first time and now could not, debriefed me over a biscuit that flaked like a veteran. \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d she said, which is a sentence that sets off the sprinklers in my head. \u201cThe pamphlet. A dozen pieces. Yours aren\u2019t quite poems and they\u2019re not quite essays and we\u2019re not sorry about that. A small thing that fits a coat pocket and can be given to a person on a bench. We\u2019ve mocked up covers.\u201d She laid out three options like shirts before a wedding. One was a blue that felt slightly dishonest. One was a green that would take a bad photograph. One was exactly the colour of the river when it had decided to help. The title was our argument. \u201cNot What You Win\u201d had the plainness I admire and fear. \u201cThe Good Mugs\u201d made me sentimental in a way the internet would punish me for. \u201cKindness Will Not Save Us\u201d had the right fight but the wrong rhythm. In the end we did that British thing where we didn\u2019t decide, and instead we made tea and agreed to live with our indecision for a week in the hope it would resolve itself overnight.\n\nI walked from the office to the station because London reminds you that your body was designed to move in places where taxis can\u2019t. On the train, a man slept with his mouth open and the confidence of someone who has never woken up on television with his own face on a nearby screen. Opposite me a girl annotated a textbook with the hand of a person teaching herself to forgive her sentences. The clouds over Woking organised themselves politely into ranks. I wrote half a paragraph about the way stations pretend to be beginnings when they are mostly middles. The woman who checked our tickets asked for mine like she was asking my name for the second time at a party and we both decided to pretend we remembered.\n\nAt the radio station they led me into a room that was both a cupboard and a spaceship. The producer was thirty and had the deep calm of a person who routinely shepherds panic into sound. He told me that we were going to talk about the rhythm of sadness and how to time a laugh so it works on the radio and then, without moving any of his muscles, asked me if I had ever been so angry I had bitten something that wasn\u2019t food. We talked for twelve minutes about fathers without saying the word \u201cgrief\u201d once and then, after the red light had politely put itself to bed, he asked me to sign a staff mug. \u201cWe break them on Thursday afternoons,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt looks unprofessional if it\u2019s one of the expensive ones.\u201d I wrote, \u201cDo not put this in the dishwasher,\u201d and then stood with the pen above the ceramic for a heartbeat and added, \u201cBe kind to the person who washes it.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, I sat on a bench in Embankment Gardens and watched a pigeon perform despair with a level of commitment that made it not only believable but briefly fashionable. A woman in running kit did the sort of stretching that makes strangers feel tired, and a man in a suit that had known better days ate a ham sandwich with the gravity of a priest. I phoned my mother and told her the radio had gone well and yes, of course she could listen back on the internet and no, she didn\u2019t need to call Linda because Linda had already left a voicemail asking if I could get her Mixtape Man from the weekend following the one we were talking about to do a shout-out for her cat. \u201cYou sound thin,\u201d my mother said, which is her way of asking if I am eating. I told her about the biscuits and she was satisfied in the way only carbohydrates can satisfy someone\u2019s mother at two in the afternoon.\n\nBack in Exeter that evening the river pretended it had been waiting for me specifically, which is the sort of lie I am happy to be told. Imogen had chalk dust on her nose and contempt for someone who had asked for iced coffee as if Britain had always been a place that did that. I sat in the window and tried on possible lives in the reflection. In one of them I lived in London again, wore a better jacket, ran for trains with resentment, pretended it didn\u2019t matter who was in the room. In one of them I moved to a village with a pub that gave you change in coins that felt like old prayers, and I wrote in a wooden chair that had injured men for a century, and I sometimes forgot to be terrified. In the actual life I drank coffee that had been made by someone who refuses to spell my name correctly on principle, and I cut a paragraph that tried too hard, and I put the paragraph on a small pile called \u201cKeep for later,\u201d which is mostly a compost heap with delusions of grandeur.\n\nThe letter from Parc turned into a parcel. It arrived on a Thursday afternoon smelling of permanent marker and patience. Inside there were pages in the careful hand of a man not writing to impress anyone, a list of the small tasks he had set himself: peel an orange in one motion, count the steps from cell to chapel without making it look like you are counting, learn the names of the birds that will come if you put crumbs on the windowsill and pretend you didn\u2019t mean it. There was a drawing of a mug with \u201cGOOD\u201d written on it, done in biro with a dedication to a man who had never been allowed to choose a mug in his life. There was permission from the governor and a timetable with my name in a column called \u201cVISITING EDUCATORS\u201d that made me feel briefly like a person with a backpack full of felt tips and a purpose. \u201cIf you will,\u201d he had written in the space under \u201cActivities\u201d, \u201ctell the men that even if there is nothing to be done, there are things to do.\u201d I emailed Clemency and she said that she would navigate the forms and that I should buy a belt that would not set off the scanner and that she would remind me, gently but relentlessly, that a workshop is a workshop and not an attempt to un-make the world.\n\nSpeech Day came dressed in bunting and rain that couldn\u2019t commit. The hall was how I remembered it and also smaller, because time is rude. The headteacher had the polished kindness of a man who has broken up fights by remembering boys\u2019 names. A child in a blazer sat at the piano and played something that was trying to be Beethoven and landed instead in the soft field of \u201cvery nearly.\u201d I sat on a plastic chair that had not forgiven anyone who had ever been late. When it was my turn, the microphone was both too close and too far and the floor was waxed in a way that made menace elegant. I looked at the faces of thirteen-year-olds who have learned already to hide their catastrophes and the faces of seventeen-year-olds who think they have invented every feeling. I told them I had scribbled my name on the underside of this very chair with a compass because I was bored and then spent the next year petrified my handwriting would give me away. I asked them, because I can\u2019t help myself, what was the strangest thing they had ever believed about themselves, and I held the silence at the end of the question like a bowl for their answers. A girl in the third row said she had believed for a whole year that she was bad at reading because she read quickly, and a boy in a tie he had not tied himself said he had believed he was supposed to be the one who was always fine and now he wasn\u2019t sure what the question even meant. Somewhere near the back, a boy with the eyes of a creature that knows which bushes the foxes favour looked at me and then looked away as if I had looked at him in a language he had not yet learned to understand. I told them that when I was thirteen I thought being ordinary was the worst thing, and that at thirty-seven I considered it the rescue boat. A few teachers laughed in the guilty way adults laugh when they recognise themselves. The headteacher shook my hand afterwards and thanked me for being ordinary on purpose in front of his pupils and offered me one of those biscuits that taste of fundraising and starch.\n\nIn my mother\u2019s kitchen that afternoon the smell was of onion and decision. She had written \u201cSPAG BOL\u201d on a piece of paper as if it were a spell that needed stroking into being. The radio told us about a by-election in a voice that refused to admit it hoped for chaos, and she told me that Aunt Joy had found a dance class for women with opinions and was coming home flushed twice a week with the joy of someone who had been allowed to sweat. I asked her if she still had Dad\u2019s jumper, and she got up without asking me why and went to the cupboard where she keeps the things she pretends she doesn\u2019t keep, and brought out the bag that once had apples in it. The jumper smelled like the ghost of a summer shed. She watched me smell it with the benign cruelty of a person who has been practicing not crying for longer than I\u2019ve been alive. \u201cHe wrote things down,\u201d she said, stirring the sauce with a wooden spoon that had never learned another job. \u201cNot just lists. Bits and bobs. You know that.\u201d I nodded. \u201cHe wrote bird names wrong on purpose,\u201d she added, as if confessing to petty theft, \u201cso you would correct him and you would learn them without feeling like someone was putting facts in you. He said it made you fierce in a way he liked. He kept them all.\u201d She went to the dresser and brought me a notebook with a fat elastic band in the middle and his careful untidy handwriting at the top of the first page: \u201cBlakbird, Robin, Tosspot Tit.\u201d I laughed with my whole face and then in the crease of the laugh there was the ache, and that was alright. We ate spaghetti and she told me, guarded and open, how he had once nearly auditioned for the village pantomime as a cow and had backed out because he did not want to look like the man who always said yes, and how he had regretted it and then made the allotment the place where he said yes to everything else.\n\nThe workshop at Parc required shoes you couldn\u2019t run in and a willingness to hand over your essentials to a locker that smelled, faintly, of older versions of hope. The security guards were both bored and heroic, and the metal detector was a child performing attention. The officer who escorted me through had a voice that would have served him well in church and a wrist tattoo that did not. In the classroom the tables were laid out in a horseshoe, which is a shape that makes adults behave better. The men came in with their shoulders already braced for embarrassment and their eyes already occupied elsewhere. The man who had written to me sat down and tapped the table twice with his nail because his hands needed work. I told them we would be writing lists and that I would not be confiscating any of them, and the man at the back with the beautifully ridiculous ears said thank Christ, which I chose to interpret as enthusiasm. We did the work of making it safe to say something without pretending it was safe here. They wrote \u201cTen small mercies you can make with your hands\u201d and \u201cFive facts you didn\u2019t know were true until you told them to someone else.\u201d One of them wrote that he was good at polishing shoes to the point where they resembled their own dreams of themselves and that when he got out he wanted to be paid for making other people feel ready to meet their days. One of them wrote that he knew how to fold sheets with military corners and that it might be the only useful thing he had learned in a place designed to teach you all the wrong lessons. They asked me about the television and I told them it was a machine that kept working whether you wanted it to or not, and that the only part of it that had felt like home was the part where I said what I had to say. At the end, the man who had written me the mug drew me a watch in biro, complete with a tiny second hand moving nowhere in particular, and labelled it \u201cto be wound.\u201d\n\nIt was on the way back from Parc that Eliot phoned, and the Welsh hills executed their performance of looking like a late apology. \u201cAre you at a service station?\u201d he said, and he said it with such elegant disdain for service stations that I had to pull over just to give the moment the attention it deserved. He was in a taxi that was taking too long and he wanted to complain artistically. \u201cI did the thing last night,\u201d he said, not naming which thing because there is only ever one thing and it\u2019s always the most. \u201cI said a line and I thought of you saying the other line and I wondered if we were writing into each other\u2019s blanks.\u201d There was a horn and a sigh. \u201cCan I come down,\u201d he asked without being the kind of person who asks, \u201cand read with you above the bicycle shop and then be humbled by your scones?\u201d I told him that the scones were not mine to deploy but that I would speak to the appropriate authorities. When I told Ollie he made a noise like a kettle that has decided not to boil and then he made a poster with only initials and a picture of a bicycle whose wheels were made of punctuation. \u201cNobody needs this,\u201d he said, cheerfully lying, \u201cand therefore it will be good.\u201d\n\nWe took my mother to the sea on a Saturday that had remembered what Saturdays are for. Dawlish was in the mood to please, throwing a train along the edge of itself like a trick it never gets bored of. We bought chips so hot they made us walk like injured birds. A gull the size of a possible sin hovered above my mother\u2019s head with the entitlement of a landlord, and she waved it away with the hand of a woman who has taught bigger creatures their manners. She told me, because she always gets around to saying the thing she has come to say, that she had found a letter in the shed, addressed to \u201cR + M\u201d in my father\u2019s unsteady pretence at a copperplate. Inside was a list of the things he could do if he had to leave earlier than he wanted. \u201cPut the watch in the drawer for a while,\u201d it said, \u201cand don\u2019t you dare throw out the fork. The beans need it. Rowan will say he hates performance and then he\u2019ll get on a stage because he can\u2019t stop himself telling the kitchen stories to strangers. Let him. He\u2019ll come home.\u201d My mother had underlined \u201cHe\u2019ll come home\u201d in two colours, because her extravagance is usually for other people, and she rolled her eyes at the idea of being predicted and then she cried with her mouth in that tidy way she has and let me see it. We sat on the sea wall and I could feel the day going to sleep under my hands, and it was the sort of tired that tells you you\u2019ve earned it.\n\nThe reading with Eliot above the bicycle shop made the stair perform its party piece twice. People came because they had been told to be reasonable for too long and this did not look reasonable. The room was too warm and too thankful. Eliot wore black because he has never learned that Exeter does not care, and he looked at the fairy lights like a man being introduced to earnestness for the first time at a cousin\u2019s wedding. We took turns and then we took risks and then we took questions from a corner where someone had brought a baby who gurgled when we said the word \u201ckind.\u201d He read the orange again and let it have more juice this time, and I read something about the hardware shop where the man behind the counter always says, \u201cWe can sort you out,\u201d as if that were a vow and not a sales technique. When the questions bent themselves into weapons, we set them down gently and asked the askers if they were alright. Afterward, he stood on the pavement and tried to light a cigarette in a wind that knew better, and I stood next to him with a bag of Imogen\u2019s scones and we performed d\u00e9tente with crumbs. He said, and I could feel the sentence rough its way over his teeth, that he had been shown a picture of himself at nineteen and had not found it useful, and that perhaps he needed a picture of himself at forty with his mouth closed. I told him that mouths are difficult, and he laughed with relief like a man putting down a small heavy box. He asked to see the river like a tourist and I took him to it like a local, and we leaned and did the man thing of pretending to be thinking about boats when we were really thinking about not drowning.\n\nThe day the pamphlet\u2019s title decided itself, it did it while I was not in the room. I came home to an email from the question-mark brooch that said, \u201cWe\u2019re all pretending this was your idea. \u2018Not What You Win.\u2019 Font attached. There will be an argument about staples on Tuesday.\u201d The cover was the river colour and the paper had that roughness that makes a reader feel they are permitted to touch. I held the PDF up to the light as if it might develop like a photograph. The list of contents made me feel both organised and exposed. I wrote back my agreed-upon yes and then walked to the allotments with a flask because there is no celebration like watching someone water beans. The man with the runner beans was there, shoulders curved to the job like a blessing, and I handed him tea and he handed me string, and we built a frame that could teach you as much about performance as any stage. Tension and give, resistance and the refusal to snap, the memory a knot keeps of the hands that tied it. He told me, in the unpunctuated way people talk when they are doing something they understand, about his grandsons and the tomatoes they grew on a windowsill and how the window sill had got into the tomatoes. I listened, which is to say I let him not ask a question and still expect an answer. When I left he said, \u201cMind how you go,\u201d and it felt like a benediction rather than an instruction.\n\nIn August the swifts left in the middle of a sentence and the river lost its gossip. School uniforms appeared in shop windows like an apology. The bicycle shop put up a sign about repairing punctures and broken hearts and Ollie pretended he hadn\u2019t done it and then took the credit when asked. The pamphlet proofs arrived in a cardboard envelope that sounded important when opened. I sat at the table with a pencil and did the religious work of making small black marks on a future. I changed \u201cand\u201d to \u201cbut\u201d and then back again as if the conjunction were a life choice. I called my mother to ask if she wanted the dedication or if that would create more trouble than it solved, and she said that she wanted to be on the acknowledgements in small print because she is not a show-off, but that if I put Aunt Joy on the acknowledgements I had to let her choose her own comma. I wrote, \u201cFor M., for R., for the cupboard with the good mugs,\u201d and I stopped while I was still being honest.\n\nAt the launch, which was a jug of wine, a jug of water and a table that had seen more ambitious nights, people queued to have me write their names on paper like it meant anything. A woman who had seen me on the television and then avoided her sadness for two months and then failed to avoid it the following Tuesday asked me to write, \u201cYou are not what you win,\u201d and I did, and she pressed the book to her stomach like a baby and I did not show off by being clever. The man from Parc\u2019s wife came without telling me she would and held my hand for long enough that the part of me that hates being held had to shut up. Eliot sent flowers wrapped in brown paper that made them look earnest, and a card that said, \u201cThis is not a concession,\u201d which is his romance. Imogen refused to let me pay for the traybakes and Ollie did a speech that pretended to be a joke and was, in truth, a stitch in something that might hold.\n\nAfter the people, after the photographs in which my shoulder is again, miraculously, relaxed, after the tinny clink of glasses that revealed themselves to be plastic, I walked home through a city that had finally let its hair down. I passed the charity shop window where the sequinned dress had given up its mystery to a woman who was taking it somewhere it deserved. I passed the second-hand bookshop that smelled of ambitions that had been well loved. At the bridge I leaned the way men have always leaned and I wound the watch in my pocket because some habits are more honest than prayer. The bells did not sulk. The swifts were gone and the sky had put the kettle on for the long boil of autumn. The pamphlet lay in my bag, the good mugs waited in their cupboard, Exeter kept its gossip to itself, and I went upstairs to the flat that had forgiven me, and I slept under the comfortable weight of a day that had not tried to turn itself into a headline.Chapter Seven\n\nBy September the swifts had packed their tiny bags and left without forwarding addresses, and the river went back to telling slower stories. The city began that annual rehearsal for weather, finding scarves at the backs of drawers like old loyalties and pretending we had always known how to stand still and be rained on with dignity. I woke one morning to a sky the colour of kitchen foil and the sound of the council\u2019s leaf blower insisting autumn was a structural fault that could be remedied by enthusiasm. The watch on my desk ticked with the equanimity of a small god. I had not learned to be equanimous, but I had learned to wind.\n\nThe pamphlet did what small books do when they are allowed to leave the house. It went into the world in coat pockets and handbags and once, according to a photograph sent by a woman called Shauna from Paisley, into the hollow of a radiator where it sat for two days like a guilty child until the central heating admitted defeat and gave it back. People wrote to say they had read it on a lunch break and then gone back to their desks with their shoulders lowered by one stubborn inch. A man in Leeds posted it to his brother in Ballinasloe with a note that said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like poems,\u201d and then wrote to me in a panic to ask if it was, in fact, a poem, because he feared he had lied. A woman in Birmingham asked if I would sign three copies to \u201cSaira, who has fought and won, Kay, who is still fighting, and Mum, who says she never fought anyone but lies beautifully.\u201d The small publisher sent me an email with the subject line \u201cReprint?\u201d and the question mark did a small dance in my stomach I tried to ignore and then welcomed like a proper guest.\n\nIt turns out if you say \u201cnot what you win\u201d out loud in public enough times, people assume you are the sort of person who is immune to prizes and the weather. I am not immune to either. The first time a list appeared with my name on it I felt the old wire tighten in the room, the one that attaches me to the version of myself who believes affection is a ration and whoever gets the largest tin has eaten yours. The list was for a prize with a name that sounds like a piece of furniture, and the email came from a literary administrator who has never left a kettle unattended in her life. Clemency phoned before I could forward it to her and said, warmly but strictly, that I was to say \u201cthank you\u201d in three places and not be caught in a photograph trying to disappear into my own jacket. \u201cThis is not a night for humility you wear like borrowed shoes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will eat the canap\u00e9s instead of taking them for a walk. Also, wear the river-colour tie.\u201d\n\nI wore the tie because it looked like somebody had bottled a good day. The event was in a room that had hosted enough ceremonies to believe itself a church, which is to say there were chairs and opinions. Eliot was there with his coat the colour of a decision and a smile that revealed nothing about the rest of him. He waved like a diplomat from a friendly but distant country. The man from the big paper asked if he could write a profile and the woman from the radio promised me three minutes on a Friday if I could make grief witty. I smiled in a way my face recognised as survival and watched several conversations in which I starred glide past like swans that would not let me feed them. The winner was someone I liked in print and in person, which is a relief and also a fresh challenge for my pettier self. On the train home I balanced the certificate on my knees and texted my mother a photograph; she wrote back, This is the nice paper, and attached a small string of party hat emojis that looked like a regiment of festive carrots.\n\nIt was after that night that the paper ran their profile anyway, as papers will, with a picture of me looking like I\u2019d been told to imagine a joke about someone else. The headline contained the word \u201creluctant,\u201d which is the lazy shorthand people use when a person\u2019s face refuses to arrange itself into uninterrupted ambition. The journalist had been to Exeter and asked me about the river and my father and the cupboard with the good mugs, and I had answered in the only way I know, which is to tell the truth and then tidy it as if it were late for something. When the piece appeared, the quotes were accurate and the adjectives were not, and it included a paragraph about how I \u201chad not married my work\u201d that made me sound like a man who had jilted a profession at the altar and fled to Devon with grief on the back of a moped. Imogen read it with the expression she reserves for weather forecasts and break-up songs, rolled her eyes so thoroughly she nearly saw her own thought processes, and drew a moustache on my newsprint face with legitimate skill. \u201cYou look better,\u201d she said, handing it back, and then put it under the grinder to stop it from floating around my head like a wasp.\n\nMeanwhile my mother decided the shed had had long enough to sulk and needed to be helped into its next life. The allotment committee, who are a body composed of men with twine and verdicts, had offered me my father\u2019s plot on condition that I sign a form promising never to grow more than a patriotic proportion of courgettes. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d my mother said in the voice she used when I was six and had hidden my school shoes under my bed in protest at the concept of walking as a public act. We went down on a Saturday that had decided to be generous and found the fork where it had always leant, a vertical memorial that did not make a fuss. The shed smelled like my father\u2019s pockets, which is to say, a small kingdom of twine and pencils and the tobacco he didn\u2019t smoke anymore except in habits. We emptied boxes that had kept themselves busy by shifting their contents from one corner to another when left alone. There were seed packets that had decided to retire and a tin of screws that looked exactly like a tin of screws and a jam jar full of coins from three currencies and a decade. There were notebooks with my father\u2019s handwriting practising its untidiness and a page headed \u201cThings to Mend,\u201d under which he had written \u201cFence, gate, attitude (Rowan\u2019s), patience (mine).\u201d\n\nUnder a stack of plant pots we found a shoe box with three cassettes in it, labelled in that careful not-careful hand: \u201cBirds 1998\u201d, \u201cTo M\u201d, and \u201cR\u2014Don\u2019t be cross.\u201d My mother took the one with her letter and put it in her pocket as if it had heat, and I took mine and did not put it near my heart because I am sentimental about too many other things as it is. We no longer own a device for the purpose, because time is impolite, but Linda from down the road does, because Linda has never met a gadget she didn\u2019t store for later. She set it up on her kitchen table between a fruit bowl the shape of regret and a small army of porcelain hedgehogs, and we pressed play knowing we had not prepared enough for the sound of a man we loved arriving in the room. At first there was only tape hiss, the radio static of the past making itself at home, and then my father cleared his throat in that way he used to, as if giving the air a chance to behave.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, and then laughed at himself for saying right to nobody. \u201cRowan. If you\u2019re listening to this, first of all, your mother hasn\u2019t thrown out my old tape recorder, which is a victory for my side. Second of all, I am about to say some things I am not clever enough to write down because then I\u2019ll fiddle with the words instead of telling you what I mean.\u201d He proceeded to misname birds for seven minutes in a row with such deliberate wrongness I laughed and then had to put my hand over my mouth because of the sound trying to get out. \u201cBlakbird. Robbin. Angry Poet Tit.\u201d Between jokes, he fitted in the sentences I had wanted and the ones I had not known I wanted. He told me to be common as muck in my kindness and fancy as I liked in my sentences. He told me to wind the watch when I needed the day to have a spine. He told me that if I ever felt like I was losing, to check whether I had started counting the wrong things. When the tape clicked off Linda and my mother and I sat there as if we had been told not to move during a wasp, and Linda broke the spell by putting a plate of biscuits in front of us because she is a magician who uses sugar as her wand.\n\nI took the allotment because it would have been rude not to. The first time I put the fork into the earth and leaned, I remembered the choreography of it in my bones like a song I hadn\u2019t liked at the time and now found myself humming. The soil gave up its stones with that reluctant generosity dirt displays when it likes you. The man with the runner beans watched me from his side of the thin wire civilization and nodded as if to say I had not ruined anything yet. He came over with string and a suggestion about wind and we built another frame, this time with ghost hands helping. In the afternoons I would take my pages down there and read a paragraph to the path between the beds, because I have decided there is no point in pretending not to be the man who talks to dirt. When I looked up, there were always the gulls doing philosophy at the sky and the small children doing philosophy at the puddles, and somehow the arguments overlapped.\n\nThe prison wrote to ask if I could come back and bring, if possible, more lists. The men had found the business of naming mercies a tolerable way to spend a Tuesday, and one of them had started a thing he called \u201cThe Cupboard,\u201d which was a list on the wall in the education block of items to try when the day was behaving like a locked door. It included \u201clearn the names of the people who clean your cell and say them like they\u2019re worth knowing,\u201d and \u201cremember your favourite word, not the one you should like, the one you do,\u201d and \u201cwhat to do with an orange when there is no knife,\u201d which I suspect he wrote to make me laugh. The governor had given cautious permission for the small publisher to print fifty copies of a zine we were calling \u201cThe Good Mugs,\u201d and the brooch editor had cried on the phone for a bit, then cleared her throat, then asked me for names to put in the back under \u201cMade by,\u201d and I did my best to do no harm. On my second visit, the man with the ridiculous ears read aloud a list called \u201cReasons I Did Not Hit Him Back\u201d and it was so beautiful and so ferocious in its refusal to make a saint out of himself that the room stood up in the way rooms sometimes do when no one told them to.\n\nIt was after that workshop that Eliot came down on a weekday and tried to pretend he did not care about trains. He arrived at St David\u2019s in a coat that had not been tested for drizzle and a face that had recently done a fight with a mirror and called it grooming. He looked around as if cities are actors who can remember their lines if prompted. \u201cThis whole place,\u201d he said, \u201cfeels like a good sentence you\u2019ve taken an axe to in the right places.\u201d I took him to the caf\u00e9 where Imogen refused to be impressed on principle and then, when he said the words \u201csingle origin\u201d without performing a somersault, allowed him to exist. We walked by the river and he refused, out of stubbornness and fear of clich\u00e9, to say \u201cpretty,\u201d and we talked about work in the way men do when they are trying not to show underbellies. He confessed he had said no to a television thing that would have made him the man who says yes to all the things, and I told him I had said no to cereal bars, and we stood there being faintly heroic about not selling ourselves for oat flakes. It was only later he admitted it felt more like relief than courage.\n\nWe read again above the bicycle shop because Ollie announced we would and then had the terrible luck of being right. The poster this time was just a picture of the river and a pencil with a halo, and when Eliot saw it he said he had always suspected the West Country of being better at piety. The room was full of people who had decided they liked the sensation of concentrating together and a few who had come because they had resolved, in a valiant way, to start liking poetry by force. Eliot read a piece about shame that did the precise unkindness required to be merciful, and I read a list called \u201cInstructions for the Ordinary Day\u201d that included \u201cmake tea in a mug someone else would choose,\u201d and \u201ccall your mother and ask about one thing she could have been champion of,\u201d and \u201cfind a faintly ridiculous bird and applaud it.\u201d At the end an old man with hair like a memory came up and told us the story of when he had been nineteen and had all his money stolen by a woman he later married, and we listened for long enough that the listening turned into a kind of love.\n\nThe invitation to the school\u2019s winter fair arrived on a postcard with a snowman who looked like he\u2019d had to reapply for his job. Could I judge mince pies without hurting anyone and would I be willing to read something at the turning on of the lights that would not cause children to ask awkward questions about mortality. I said yes to the pies and maybe to the reading, and then spent an afternoon trying to write a sentence in which a fairy light has a crisis of faith and still gets turned on without anything tragic happening to it. On the day, I stood in a gym that smelled of wax and teenage bravery and tasted thirty-two pies and learned both the limits to human cinnamon tolerance and the thrill of being permitted to wield a score sheet. A child in a homemade elf hat asked me if I was the man who had been on the television and whether I could tell his dad that it is allowed to cry when you watch adverts; I told him that I could tell his dad and that his dad would agree but would phrase it in a way that made it sound like he had invented the concept.\n\nClemency arranged a small tour of bookshops that were really rooms with good lighting and excellent chairs. We did Bristol on a Tuesday to an audience that included a man who knows the difference between \u201caffect\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d and will speak up about it if provoked, and we did Bath to a roomful of women who knit during questions and then produced more insight than anyone else in Britain. We did Truro to a man who had driven two hours to be told it was OK to love a thing from the late 90s sincerely. On the train between cities I wrote a piece about what to pack if you plan to be generous, and it included \u201ca pen that doesn\u2019t explode under pressure,\u201d and \u201ccoins,\u201d and \u201ca cardigan with pockets that can pretend to be a hug,\u201d and \u201ca story about your worst mistake told without self-deprecation,\u201d and I read it in Falmouth to a woman who came up afterwards and said she had been waiting thirty-seven years to be told to stop making her own pain charming.\n\nIn November the river pumped itself with a kind of purpose that felt like news. The allotment went to sleep with the severity of a child refusing to be convinced. I planted garlic because Eliot told me it made you feel like you were doing something about the future, and I put my hand to the ground and it felt like a chest still breathing. My mother began her annual campaign to pretend Christmas did not require planning while simultaneously planning Christmas with a military precision that would have impressed even the most annoying head of year. Aunt Joy took up tap, which none of us deserved but all of us enjoyed, and Linda\u2019s cat found a new way to look offended by tinsel. I wound the watch and let it tick through the early dark like an argument for patience.\n\nIt was around then that the email came from the school saying a boy in Year Ten had asked if I would look at his poem, and would I tell him, gently, whether it was good because otherwise he would measure himself by silence and that was not fair. His name was Isaac and he wrote like a person who had overheard a good conversation and knew he was supposed to lean in. He wrote, \u201cI am not the boy you think is fine, I am the boy who knows where the foxes go,\u201d and when I read it I put the piece of paper down and breathed like a sensible person, which in my case is a novelty. I wrote back that he had made something with a shape and a sound and that he should write twenty more, not because he had to prove anything to anyone, but because he had found something that made one minute pay attention to the next. He sent a second poem three days later called \u201cList of Quiet,\u201d and I put it on my fridge next to my own photograph because one of us had to be in good company.\n\nThe call from the London programme came as the river was trying to be a mirror and failing in an honorable way. They wanted a Christmas show full of \u201cheart\u201d and \u201clight,\u201d and the producer used the word \u201cuplift\u201d twice in one sentence and I watched my better self try not to stand up and walk out of my body. Clemency did our layers of honesty and determined there was room for me to do a thing that would not make me look like a man delivering parsnips to a nation from a sleigh. I wrote a piece called \u201cInstructions for Christmas,\u201d which included, \u201cfind somebody who hates it and make them a cheese toastie,\u201d and \u201cremember your dead by telling a good joke they would have laughed at,\u201d and \u201cdo not attempt to reform your entire personality by Boxing Day,\u201d and \u201cput one mug at the back of the cupboard and call it January.\u201d On the night, I wore the jacket with elbow patches that smelled like its previous owner chopped wood and sang and I did not say \u201cbugger,\u201d and the studio made that fond noise it makes when it is pretending it is your living room. After, a woman stopped me at the station and told me her brother had died in February and that she had laughed at the bit with the toastie and she thought he would have loved it because he always burned everything and smiled about it. I stood there like a man confronted by mercy in a queue and promised myself, again, I would count the right things.\n\nOn the last day of the year, I went to the allotment with a flask and a notebook and the sort of optimism that leaves the door open for realism to come back in later. The beds were tart with cold and the path pretended to be an ice rink you could skate on with your eyes. The fork leaned and the shed stood and the world agreed to be bigger than my little life by at least the correct margin. I wrote a list of ten ways to enter a year and I did not number them because some things are not ranking exercises. It said, \u201cwind the watch,\u201d and \u201cbring your own light but let other people hold it,\u201d and \u201cask the river what it knows and pretend to understand,\u201d and \u201crescue one ridiculous thing and let it rescue you back.\u201d On the way home I saw a boy practicing keepy-uppies against a wall with the air of a surgeon and a girl in an enormous coat teaching a dog how to take off a mitten gently, and I put both of them in my pocket for later.\n\nAt midnight the cathedral did not sulk at all. She sang herself inside out, and the city shouted responses in the language of pans banging and fireworks admitting defeat to clouds. I stood at my window with a mug that did not match any other mug and watched Exeter remember and forget itself in the exact right proportions. My phone sulked on the table and then behaved and then sulked, and I let it because we were both tired. I thought of the men at Parc, forty seconds into a new year they had to spend the same way they had spent the last one and the next one, and I promised myself a morning in January for \u201cThe Cupboard.\u201d I thought of Isaac, and the poem about foxes, and my father\u2019s voice misnaming birds on purpose, and my mother\u2019s face when she tasted a mince pie she had not made and declared it brave. I wound the watch, listened to the tick settle into the dark like a metronome for a heart, and went to bed in a flat that had decided to forgive me again tomorrow if I asked nicely and brought coffee.Chapter Eight\n\nJanuary arrived as if it had been waiting outside the door with its boots on, pretending not to mind the cold. The river gave up its gossip and dealt in facts; frost wrote its arguments along the bins with a thoroughness I respected. I woke to a morning so bright and pitiless it made even the cathedral look freshly washed, and I did the thing that has become my compromise with the day: kettle on, blinds open, watch wound. It is hard to overstate the comfort of a small machine choosing, politely and without grandeur, to behave again when asked. The first week the city looked like it had stopped breathing by accident and needed reminding, the way you put a hand to a sleeping dog to be sure. We remembered our scarves and the gulls remembered their right to be indignant, and the council trucks performed a ballet along the quay involving grit, hand signals and the kind of mutual trust I associate with marriages where nobody posts about it.\n\nI kept my promise to Parc the second Tuesday, the one the governor had offered me cautiously, as if kindness was a resource he was not quite prepared to believe could be replenished. I learned the system well enough to move through it without insulting it: belt off, watch in the tray, palms up, questions answered in the tone that tells a person you know they are not the one who designed the rules. The corridor smelled of floor polish and the tiredness of men who have learned to stand still. In the classroom the horseshoe of tables was waiting again like a tool that had made itself useful and resented it slightly. The men came in as men do when their names have been said too loudly for too long. This time I brought a list with me, which is to say I brought a way to bring them to the table without making them present their throats. \u201cThe Cupboard,\u201d I wrote on the whiteboard, and underneath it, in my careful teacher hand, because that is the role I can fill without lying: \u201cThings to do when there is nothing to be done.\u201d\n\nWe made it together, which is the only way I know to honour the fiction that we were not pretending at anything else. \u201cLearn the names of the rivets in the bunk,\u201d offered the man with the ridiculous ears, and the room did that laugh it does when it has decided liking you is easier than distrusting you. \u201cFold a T-shirt more slowly than pride would allow,\u201d said another, and a third contributed, in a voice two sizes too large for his sentence, \u201cWrite a postcard to the person you were nineteen, and forgive him for thinking he would never need to learn to cook rice.\u201d The man who had started this with his letter held the pen like a tool he had just discovered had more than one function and wrote, deliberately, \u201cBreathe into your hands until they stop being a weapon.\u201d I stood there with the marker and nodded like a priest and the room let itself be church. In the break, the officer with the wrist tattoo asked me if I knew the poem about the people in the boats and the mouth and I said I did and he told me, with the kind of careful resentment people keep for the things that have hurt them into beauty, that he had once cried by a fence. When I left, the list stayed behind on the wall, and I tried not to imagine it being taken down and put in a folder marked \u201cARTS,\u201d because imagining it there felt like a promise I wanted to keep.\n\nThe watch stopped on a Friday, exactly at midday, the hands lined up in a way that would have looked deliberate if I were a person inclined to read omens where there are only guts and gears. I put it to my ear and heard nothing and the quiet had weight. I do not need a watch in the way men used to; I live inside a machinery of notifications that will not allow me to die without an alarm. And yet the silence sent me into a small panic that felt exactly as serious as it needed to and no more. I asked around quietly, because Exeter is full of people who know exactly what you need if you ask in the tone that suggests you will not be a burden. A man with a stall on the market offered the name of a watchmaker in Topsham who, according to him, had fixed a clock that had decided to stop every year on the date a woman\u2019s husband had died. \u201cShe made it behave kindly,\u201d he said, with the reverence of a man who had had enough of depending on magic. I took the train along the river, the mudflats spread like an old argument and the boats looking embarrassed for ever having believed they were essential.\n\nThe watchmaker\u2019s shop was not a shop so much as a room that had decided to remember its purpose after thinking about being a gallery. It smelled faintly of the kind of oil you only own if you own a screwdriver whose handle has grown glossy from use. Behind the counter sat a woman whose face had both kindness and a refusal to be hurried arranged on it in equal parts. She was Polish by the sound in her vowels and the anatomy of patience in her hands. \u201cIt runs,\u201d she said, after I had told her my grandfather and the shed and my father\u2019s stubbornness like a confession. \u201cBut it sulks. Hairspring\u2026\u201d She held it up to the light with the sort of tenderness you reserve for small animals and very old jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s tired. We don\u2019t replace tired. We polish it and we regulate it and we tell it the day is not an emergency.\u201d She set it on a small cushion like a bed and listened to it with a stethoscope the size of a button. \u201cYou have wound it like you are sorry,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to wind it like you meant it. People do this,\u201d she added, and tapped the bench lightly with a fingernail. \u201cThey think time will be offended.\u201d She told me to come back Tuesday, which was to say, live a couple of days without insisting the past behave like a tool, and I went to the quay and watched the river thicken under a light that felt honest, and I went home and tried to be the sort of man who could use the oven without consulting the internet.\n\nImogen had stuck a hand-lettered sign in the caf\u00e9 window that read, \u201cJanuary: we bake through it,\u201d and underneath, in smaller writing, \u201cAlso the electricity bill has joined a gym and is very enthusiastic.\u201d She had acquired a ceramic penguin from a charity shop, which she kept moving around the tables with the erratic logic of a woman giving herself a game in a month that punishes illusions. \u201cIt\u2019s the size of a tiny baby and has the moral life of a teenager,\u201d she said, when I asked, and then she told me the landlord had suggested that perhaps the market would bear a little adjustment, and we stood in the doorway and let January blow through us until the idea of bearing anything felt ludicrous. We ended up arranging a night called \u201cPower To The Buns,\u201d because neither of us has ever met a pun we did not regret and accept in the same motion. Ollie made a poster that featured a lightbulb eating a scone, which looked exactly wrong, and a list of names of people who would read, sing, or otherwise permit themselves to be seen in exchange for money put in a jar. I wrote copy for it that tried very hard not to be pity and landed somewhere closer to invitation: Come in out of the weather. We will warm you by proximity and pastry. Bring coins. Bring hands. Try to leave lighter than you arrived. If you cannot, we will send you away with cake.\n\nThe night was one of those that make you think we have been practicing for this our whole lives: standing in too-small rooms and making more air by listening. The fairy lights did their low work and the coffee machine tried not to interrupt at the wrong moments. Imogen refused to take the microphone and then, in the second half, told a story about a bus stop in Salcombe and a woman who cried into her gloves and the thunderous relief of being permitted to sit near a stranger who does not make you explain yourself. Ollie read a poem that admitted the existence of a sadness he had not previously given papers to and a girl of about sixteen sang like she had learned to be brave by mistake. At the end, when we counted the jar in the kitchen with the honesty of people who know exactly which coins are which, the sum was enough, not to save anything permanently, because we do not tell ourselves that kind of story here, but to give the month a spine and the bill a rival. Imogen wrote the number down on the back of a receipt as if it were a spell and stuck it under the penguin with a kind of private ecclesiastical satisfaction. When we walked home along the dark river the lamps threw coins across it as if bribing the water to keep behaving.\n\nEliot rang on a Wednesday and did not abbreviate it. He had that particular London quiet in his voice that means a person is alone in a room and is pretending their aloneness is a choice. \u201cI have been offered a residency at a magazine,\u201d he said, and I could hear the capital letters arranging themselves as they left his mouth. \u201cIt involves being in a glass box twice a week and being watched while I write in order to prove that writing happens and is not a trick. The money is insulting in both directions. The concept is\u2026 you can imagine.\u201d I could. I could see him in a window where people buy linen, leaning on a sentence while a woman with a loyalty card wonders if she is supposed to clap. \u201cThey asked if I would consider inviting you,\u201d he said, and somehow managed to make the word \u201cinviting\u201d sound like a long corridor. \u201cWe could be clever about it. We could burn the box down with tenderness. I could wear a paper crown. I could refuse to produce anything legible.\u201d He laughed, and the laugh had the shape of a thing you keep until it either saves you or ruins your appetite.\n\nI thought about it in the way I am learning to think, which is to ask myself if the story that would be told about it would be one I wanted to watch, and if the person I would be in that story is someone I would lend my mug to. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be watched while I\u2019m not lying,\u201d I said, eventually. \u201cI already find it hard enough not to perform my honesty into a shape that suits. The box would be too much box.\u201d There was a pause that was not offended and not entirely relieved. \u201cTell them you\u2019re inventing a new residency,\u201d I added. \u201cTwo chairs not facing each other, once a week, two writers who are not trying to win anything. We could do it in a library and leave the door ajar.\u201d He exhaled in a way that sounded, for a second, like gratitude. \u201cYou\u2019ve become unfashionable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very attractive.\u201d We arranged a date for him to come down and, for the first time since the talent show announcement, I felt the wire between us behave like string, which is to say it learned give.\n\nIsaac sent me a poem on a bad Thursday called \u201cWhat to Do When the Foxes Choose Your Garden.\u201d It began with the sound they make, described carefully and without drama, and proceeded to list instructions that would not fix anything and would make everything feel less like a verdict. \u201cYou could bang a pot,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut it won\u2019t make them move any quicker, so wash it afterwards and think you\u2019ve accomplished something.\u201d He had learned the shape now, the way a sentence can curve its shoulder around the fragile thing it is carrying without dropping it. I asked him if he\u2019d like to read at Power To The Buns in February and he wrote back that he would if he could bring his dad. I told him he could bring anyone who could stand and clap. When the night came, he stood next to the penguin in his school shoes and read four lines that made his father\u2019s face perform that ancient trick of pretending something else is making your eyes behave like that. His father, afterwards, waited until Isaac had been congratulated by enough women with nice hair to survive a week, and then he came up to me like a man who had decided to ask a question and knew he would have to do it without bluster. \u201cHe wrote that,\u201d he said, nodding at the space in which the poem had happened. \u201cAnd my chest felt like\u2026 not panic. Not panic, but the cousin of it, who turns up without bringing a casserole. Is that what happens?\u201d I said that sometimes it is exactly that and sometimes it is worse and sometimes it is the thing that will keep you from hitting someone who would later become a story you tell with unnecessary honesty. He nodded and did the British man thing of losing all his words at once and becoming grateful, and I told him he had done alright by breeding a boy who made a room behave.\n\nThe river came up one weekend in February the way it does every few years to remind us who owns this place. The boards went up along the quay with the speed of an old habit; the ducks looked offended on behalf of someone else. Imogen and I carried sacks as if we had been cast in a drama about resilience, and she shouted instructions at me using nouns I had never heard used like verbs outside a kitchen. People appeared with mops and sincere faces and the sort of camaraderie that flourishes best forty minutes into a catastrophe that is large enough to be meaningful and small enough to be contained. We moved chairs onto tables and tables onto counters and a child in a Spider-Man mask threaded himself through all of us doing his best to rescue things that were not strictly in peril. When the water pressed its forehead against the glass, pretending to consider coming in for coffee, I thought of how long I had lived thinking that weather was a thing that happened to other people while I arranged my sentences under kinder skies. After, when it retreated sulkily and left the smell of silt and relief, we scrubbed and laughed in the way that is not about joy but about endurance. Imogen refused to throw out the penguin because \u201che needs to see things,\u201d and afterwards he looked different in a way only we could see.\n\nThe reprint of the pamphlet arrived with an email that had the subject line \u201cWe did the thing,\u201d and a photograph of a pallet that looked like a giant\u2019s idea of Christmas. The brooch editor wrote that bookshops were requesting twos and threes in a way that made her fond of humanity and then sent me a separate message that said, \u201cA larger house asked if you\u2019d like a proper book,\u201d with a winky face, which is her way of placing a cushion between me and the furniture. Clemency and I sat at my table and drank coffee and she looked at me over her cup with the precise expression she uses for matters that could turn either into a feast or a migraine. \u201cWe can let them buy our dignity,\u201d she said, \u201cif we also make them buy you a jacket that is not a joke.\u201d She laid out the arithmetic of it, the way she does when she thinks I will hide inside the complication to avoid making a decision: advances and rights and deadlines like polite teeth. I made lists in the column of my notebook that says \u201cThings With Consequences,\u201d and wrote under it: what will you have to rush, what will you teach yourself to hate, what will you get to carry that you could not have carried alone. In the end we did the thing we do, which is say yes as if it is the first time we have been asked, and write a clause about the cupboard with the good mugs. The brooch editor sent a congratulatory email that read, \u201cWe will be jealous admirably,\u201d and I loved her in that moment like an aunt who knows when to arrive and when to leave.\n\nMy mother slipped on the step in her kitchen in late February and phoned not to report it but to ask if I had any spare plasters, which is our domestic euphemism for help. I went over with a bag full of uncertain solutions and found her sitting on a chair with a dish towel wrapped around her wrist and her mouth arranged at the angle that means she is behaving for my benefit. The skin was bruised but not broken, a small riot under good lighting. She told me, with the bored patience of a person who has had worse, about the neighbour who had started composting as if he were the inventor of the concept and how she had refrained from saying she had been composting since compost was called rubbish. We made tea in a way that made the kitchen remember why it had been built. I found an old elastic bandage in the cupboard where she keeps string and historical jam and we wrapped her wrist while she told me, without looking at me, that she had listened to the cassette again and this time she had laughed through the whole thing and then had to sit down. \u201cHe calls the robin \u2018Robbin\u2019 as if he\u2019s heard something about someone else,\u201d she said, and we both smiled the way you smile when you are letting something not hurt you on purpose. Before I left she insisted on going out to the shed to show me the way the light came through a crack at half past two and made a bright stripe across the bench exactly where my father had kept the small flat-headed screwdriver. We stood there while it did its afternoon miracle and I thought of the watchmaker telling me I was allowed to mean it when I turned something that had been asleep back on.\n\nEliot arrived the first week of March in a coat that had given up on keeping anyone warm and a bag of groceries he had bought because he had decided to perform normalcy and it had looked like this at the till. He put on my kettle like a man applying for a visa and unpacked fennel as if hoping to be forgiven before the smell arrived. We cooked in my kitchen with the awkward grace of two people offering each other an apology without agreeing on the terms. He cut onions with too much attention and cried with the concentration of a man who refused to make a metaphor out of it. We ate at the table, the watch ticking between us like a third companion who had agreed to refrain from comment. He told me he had started seeing a woman called Anu who asked him questions in a room with a rug, and I said, \u201cGood,\u201d as if he had remembered his keys. He told me he was learning to ask his sentences if they wanted to be cruel and to listen when they said no. I told him I was learning to forgive my worst drafts without congratulating myself for being magnanimous. We did not solve anything but we did not ruin anything, which, given our history, felt like a dare met.\n\nAt the next open mic, the penguin had acquired a badge that read, \u201cI survived February,\u201d which implies an administrative capability I endorse. Isaac read again and his father stood behind him like scaffolding. A woman from the college read a list about the things she puts in her pocket before going to work in the hospice and I stood outside after and let my chest hurt in the moral way. The men at Parc sent a new list for \u201cThe Cupboard\u201d via the governor, who had decided that perhaps sometimes rooms do not need to be watched to behave. It included, \u201cCount the crows and understand they have no duty to you,\u201d and \u201cWrite the name of the person you loved most with your wrong hand and see if it teaches you anything you can use,\u201d and \u201cLearn one new knot, not just so you can tie things down, but so you can unfasten yourself with competence.\u201d\n\nOn a Tuesday that pretended to be spring, the watchmaker in Topsham sent a text that consisted only of a photograph: my grandfather\u2019s watch on her palm, the second hand making its dignified laps as if nothing had happened. When I went to collect it, she explained, in the tone of someone who trusts you with facts, that the balance had been out, that time is a negotiation between desire and constraint, that regulation is not a trick but a kindness. \u201cYou will still have to wind it,\u201d she said, as if denying me a myth in which things fix themselves and stay fixed. \u201cThat will not change. Some work is meant to be daily. Otherwise you will think you have solved something that requires attention.\u201d I paid her and tried to tip, and she refused in the old country way that taught me a great deal about the kind of person I want to be when the world lets me keep being a person. I walked back to the station with the watch in my pocket and my hand on it as if it were an egg I could keep from cracking by tenderness alone.\n\nThe large house sent a draft contract that had more capital letters than sentences and a clause involving a podcast that made me feel like a man being told he must learn to yodel to qualify for a library card. Clemency and I sat again at the table while the river blew itself out into a respectable wind and worked through it as if it were a stubborn knot. \u201cThis is nothing,\u201d she said, brisk and warm. \u201cThis is a conversation we will have twice and then I will send an email that begins, \u2018As discussed,\u2019 which will frighten someone handsome.\u201d We called the brooch editor and promised her a seat at the launch because there are ways to retain decency inside the machine and one of them is to tell the people who made you feel brave you are not leaving them for better canap\u00e9s. In the evening I went to the allotment and put my fingers in the soil as if checking its pulse, and a robin\u2014an actual robin, smug as heritage\u2014sat on the fork handle and looked at me in that judgmental way birds do when they have decided to forgive you before you apologise. I misnamed it out loud, for form\u2019s sake, and the air did not correct me.\n\nAt the winter fair\u2019s late-arranged Spring Addendum, because this is a school and therefore any excuse for bunting will be found, I judged mini-eggs in nest cakes and discovered a new respect for the human capacity to arrange shredded wheat into the idea of safety. The headteacher introduced me to a boy who had written a poem with the line \u201cI am the part that stays up when the river lies down,\u201d and I resisted the urge to put him in my pocket for later. A woman I had once kissed badly in Year Eleven told me she had seen me on the television and that I looked taller and I forgave us both for everything.\n\nOne morning near the equinox I woke at five because an idea had come to sit on my chest like a caring cat. It was not a book; it was a list of ten letters to write to ten people, some of whom were alive and some of whom were not in a position to open the post. The titles wrote themselves on the page before the kettle had time to practice its opinions: To The Man Who Taught Me To Fold A Map, To My Teacher Who Let Me Pretend I Wasn\u2019t Crying, To The Judge Who Said \u201cOrdinary,\u201d To The Boy Who Thought He Had Invented Shame, To The Woman Who Put A Toastie On A Plate And Made It Medicine. I wrote the first one with my fountain pen because sometimes the antiquity of an instrument will make your better self appear. When I was done, I read it aloud to the plant that has refused to die, and the plant behaved like an audience and held its breath; then it rustled, gently, and I took that as literary acclaim.\n\nIt rained and stopped raining the way March does when it cannot decide which story it wants to tell. The city found its daffodils. The gulls argued as if the subject were new for them. I met Eliot at the station and we walked the long way to the caf\u00e9 so he could feed himself on the sort of buildings that had never learned to be ashamed of their age. He made a show of disliking the idea of scones and then ate two in a manner that would have made a vicar blush. We talked about the box again, and about the thing that happens when you let people watch you do something that is not a performance, and how it is not the watching that is the problem but the archive, the impulse to fix a moment so other people can admire themselves for catching it. \u201cI want to be unrecorded,\u201d he said, with a kind of defiance that felt like hope. \u201cJust for a couple of weeks. I want to be bad at something and have it not matter.\u201d I told him about the men at Parc and their lists, and he made the face they make in the city when a story arrives that cannot be improved by speed.\n\nOn the last day of the month there was a blackbird on the fence behind the allotment, and he sang like the city had made him responsible for something only he could deliver. I stood there with a trowel and a pocket full of seeds and let my face be what it was because there was nobody near enough to need saving from it. I could hear, distantly, the bells deciding to forgive us again, and closer by the sound of two boys practicing a dance badly and then better, and I thought, with the tidy satisfaction of a man who is learning how to count the right things, that I had written words this week that would not be ashamed to sit next to my grandfather\u2019s watch on the desk. I wound it again, later, in the window, while the river remembered how to be gossip and the light remembered how to be kind, and on the cupboard shelf the good mugs stood with the sort of generosity that never thinks to advertise itself.Chapter Ten\n\nApril arrived like someone had been dusting all night. The hedges along the towpath fattened with intent, and the river changed its mind twice before breakfast, doing that pale glitter it reserves for mornings when you are inclined to forgive it for yesterday. I found myself counting birds without asking to, not in the scientific way that puts a person in a hat, but in the way my father did, calling them by their wrong names until the right ones arrived like cousins late to a wedding. The watch came back from Topsham with an almost imperceptible swagger, the second hand doing laps as if the course had been altered to suit its dignity. I set it down on my desk and it ticked with a remorseless courtesy that made my laptop behave for a day, perhaps out of respect, perhaps out of fear of being shown up by a thing you had to wind to make it love you back.\n\nThe library said yes to our not-a-residency, and I loved it at once because the yes came wrapped in a risk assessment that included the words \u201cbenign proximity.\u201d The head librarian, a woman who wore a cardigan like armour and whose smile had the exact wattage required to make teenagers return their books, led us to a corner between local history and music theory. We put two chairs there at an unshowy angle, so anyone determined to watch would have to tilt their head and discover the discomfort was their own invention. Eliot came down in a jumper that tried not to be expensive and a face that had resolved to be useful, and we sat for two hours not facing each other and wrote. People passed on their way to fines and forgiveness, some of them slowing to pretend they were interested in the shelf behind us, one or two going so far as to take down a book about canal engineering and carry it with the reverence of a prop that had found its way into their hands. A boy I did not know stood in the aisle for ten minutes and stared at his shoes until his mother arrived and sat down two tables away with the sort of patience that deserves a medal and is instead compensated with the soft satisfaction of watching her child pretend to be brave where bravery is cheap.\n\nIt is a curious relief to be seen in your ordinary position. I have become used to being asked to perform the domestic tricks of kindness at an angle that flatters the camera; sitting with my back neither straight nor slumped, arranging my mouth around a sentence that does not yet trust me was a defiance I did not know I needed. Eliot\u2019s pen moved with the determined indecision I recognise in men who have taught themselves neatness as an apology, and every now and then he would stop and look up at a light fitting as if it were a line break he was hoping would blink first. An elderly man approached at one point with a plastic bag full of past and asked us, without asking us, to explain what on earth we thought we were doing making a living out of the nouns other people use for free. Eliot told him, very gently, that we were practising failure in public so it wouldn\u2019t come as a shock later. The man nodded in a way that could have meant anything, took his books to the desk, and left a chocolate biscuit on the edge of my table like a tithe.\n\nClemency, who had been born between two meetings and will outlive several platforms, arrived halfway through and took a photograph so politely it almost didn\u2019t happen. She perched on the radiator and whispered a running commentary to herself about jackets she had seen that day that had not deserved their buttons, and then handed me a printout of a schedule that looked like it had been designed to punish indecision. The large house had put together a list of cities and dates that made my knees behave like someone else\u2019s, and the small press had countered with a list of rooms they could ask nicely and a bag of postcards that had been printed in a hurry and looked like it, which is how I prefer my future. We agreed, with the sort of speed only possible between people who already know the arguments, that we would call the book The Cupboard and arrange the essays like shelves, and that no chapter would be named after a virtue because the last thing either of us wanted was an index that sounded like a sermon.\n\nI went back to Parc with a cardboard box full of the zine the brooch editor had coaxed into being from the men\u2019s lists, and a head full of cautions about what it means to put a thing in print inside a place built to take away permanence. The officer with the wrist tattoo made a joke about autographing contraband and then checked my shoes for goodwill the way a parent checks a child for pockets full of frogs. The men came in with the energy of people who\u2019ve been told there will be something new and are prepared to dislike it on principle, because principle is a shield that gets heavy but does its job. We wrote more for The Cupboard, this time a column called \u201cWhat We Meant To Say,\u201d and there were admissions about considerateness given too late and jokes not told because the room could not be trusted and the formulation of the sentence \u201cI\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m disappointed\u201d as wielded by a woman who deserved better. At the end we put the zine on the table and the men handled it like a small skittish animal, surprised by its weight, embarrassed by their own care. The man with the ridiculous ears put his copy under his jumper against his chest and declared he would read it with the respect he had never afforded a manual.\n\nIsaac sent a poem to a competition and did not make the shortlist, and his email arrived with the politeness of a boy trying not to trouble a man he had only recently decided was safe. He wrote that he hoped he had not wasted anyone\u2019s time and that perhaps his foxes were a bit ordinary, and then he apologised to me for saying ordinary like it was a slur. I wrote back longer than I meant to and told him that \u201cnot what you win\u201d is not an alibi, it\u2019s a technique, and that there is a thinness to certain kinds of recognition that you only detect when you hold them against the light of an actual afternoon. I told him to meet me by the war memorial with two poems and a packet of crisps and we read under a sky that had elected to be complicated. He had made something better in the gap between sending and not being chosen, and I told him a thing I wish someone had told me when I was seventeen and inventorying my heart: do not confuse quiet with failure; some work does its speaking after you\u2019ve gone to make tea.\n\nImogen\u2019s landlord\u2019s idea about what the market could bear arrived on an official letterhead that looked like a man wearing cufflinks to a fight. She read it in the doorway with the dignity of a person who knows the difference between an overture and a threat, and then she called Ollie, who arrived with the relentless cheer of a person arming himself with posters. We convened an emergency of the sort that happens on pavements, where the wind has a vote and everyone\u2019s practical jokes about capitalism turn, inconveniently, into practice. Out of this, overnight, grew a club we called \u201cCustard First,\u201d on the principle that some pleasures should be brought forward in case they are cancelled later by men who have never put jam in anything with love. The poster was a daffodil with fangs. People came in the way they come when they have been given a chance to demonstrate that they can carry part of the weight and would like to be permitted to. A woman brought a cake she had described as \u201cunambitious\u201d and which turned out to have ambitions large enough to require a licence. A man donated the takings from his dog grooming business for the afternoon because his clients\u2019 poodles were experiencing a boom in self-esteem and he wanted to give back. We sold out of buns in an hour and I learned the precise dimensions of the human hand when it has decided to be a purse.\n\nEliot and I were briefly enemies again because of a paragraph neither of us wrote. A magazine decided that the narrative of rivalry wears well year-round and ran a feature on \u201cTwo Poets, One Country, Infinite Fuss,\u201d in which photographs from four years ago were made to look like photographs from two months ago and sentences we had said in good faith were knotted so that they resembled wrists bound for entertainment. He sent me the link before I could find it, which is either cruelty or mercy depending on the temperature of your spleen, and typed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry they\u2019ve made me into the person who says that about you.\u201d I wrote back, \u201cI\u2019m sorry they\u2019ve made you smaller than your worst day,\u201d and then I put my phone on the table and went for a walk in the rain because some work requires weather to complete. Later, when we met for the two chairs not facing each other, we did the childish but effective thing of swapping a line each from what we were writing and promising to treat it with the kind of respect we had decided to ask the world for. He gave me a metaphor about hunger that wanted to be a train and I gave him a sentence about my mother\u2019s hands that did not want to be pretty, and we both did slightly better work for the rest of the afternoon, which is an answer I will take.\n\nThe allotment woke with an offended cough, and I found weeds that had not existed in any previous cosmology making their intentions clear between the chitted potatoes. I staked peas with a desire that bordered on persuasion and accidentally planted runner beans in a formation that implied choreography. The man with the runner beans peered over the boundary wire like a neighbour in a children\u2019s book and made a suggestion about windbreaks that contained three decades of knowledge and the precise number of knots required for a string to act like a promise. We drank tea from a flask like a prototype of companionship and he told me that tomatoes are personalities, not plants, and that my father had once sworn at a courgette for behaving like a metaphor, which I found so exactly right I had to sit down. The fork leaned where it always had, an upward insistence against a world that sometimes refused verticality, and I liked it so much I left it there on purpose.\n\nMy mother\u2019s wrist healed with the furious speed of a woman determined not to be slowed for anyone else\u2019s convenience. She developed a new contempt for step stools and a fresh respect for the floor, and began referring to her body parts in the third person as if they were colleagues she had to negotiate with. We established a new ritual that neither of us needed until then: Tuesdays were shopping and swearing, where we went to the big supermarket on the bypass and said rude things under our breath about the way they have started calling bread by its first name. She pushed the trolley with the authority of a woman who has lived too many lists and I followed like a man learning the choreography of responsibility. In the tea aisle she told me, unceremoniously, that she had been to the solicitor and had made a will and that I was to promise not to treat it like news when she died, which gave me an hour of bad temper I expended on the incompetence of an avocado. When we got home we ate cheese on toast that failed to be beautiful and succeeded in being food, and she told me Aunt Joy had thrown the fascinator a birthday party in the hope of exorcising it.\n\nThe book began to be a book. I arranged the pieces into shelves and Lerato, the editor at the large house whose emails were all verbs and mercy, wrote back with notes that made me feel both found and corrected. She suggested that the essay about the cupboard should arrive later, not because it was less important, but because she wanted it to feel like a room we\u2019d been earning entry to, and I forgave her immediately because she had understood that a cupboard can be an ending. She asked if I had more about the men at Parc and I hesitated, because their lists are theirs and my job is not to colonise them, and together we found a way to talk about The Cupboard without pretending I had invented the idea that small tasks keep us alive. The title on the proof jacket looked like the name you give a ship that has no intention of sinking, and when the parcel arrived with two advance copies wrapped in paper that had decided to be modest, I opened one with the sort of care I normally reserve for birds that have hit a window and need to be reminded of the sky.\n\nOn a Sunday that smelled of wet dog and hope, the swifts arrived back in Exeter as if somebody had turned them on with their thumb. The air above Fore Street filled with their deranged sense of purpose and the city looked up with its mouth open, which is a look I recommend. It is impossible to be sincerely grumpy when the sky has decided to be a toy; even the cathedral, moody as a teenager before a school trip, offered sound that resembled enthusiasm. I wrote a short piece about them on the bench by the water, and it tried very hard to be a poem and refused, settling instead into the geography I have taught myself to trust, a list arranged in a way that allows a person to breathe. In it I wrote that swifts make a liar out of anybody who believes in neat returns, because they arrive as a mob and leave like a rumour, and that if we are understood by anyone with wings it is by accident and because we happened to be carrying a useful crumb. I read it at Power To The Buns and the penguin, who had survived a flood and a spring clean, glowered with the proprietorial expression of a bird that has never seen a sky and is fine with that.\n\nAnu appeared in Exeter with the aura of someone who has stopped a man from performing himself into collapse for a living. She was wearing a green coat the precise shade of the river on a good day and had thoughts about bread that made me wonder if she had come from a country where bread is taken seriously and not in a museum. She watched Eliot and me read above the bicycle shop and did not applaud at the wrong moments, which is how I know she loved him in a way that might survive an argument about fennel. After, we drank beer that had opinions and she asked me questions that were not about my work and nodded in a way that suggested she was counting my adjectives and deciding whether to permit me to use them next time. I liked her with the sort of ease that usually embarrasses me, and when she left I realised something in the room had relaxed that had been ready for a fight without admitting it.\n\nOn the day the proof was signed off, I took the train to Dawlish with my mother and we sat on the sea wall holding paper cups that promised coffee and delivered optimism. The air did the thing it does when it decides to be brine first and weather second, and my mother told me about a boy she had taught who had written an essay about rivers and used the word \u201csmug\u201d correctly, and how she had nearly thrown him a parade for getting it right. I gave her the proof and she held it with the careful disrespect she reserves for objects that are not going to tell her how to live. She told me the dedication was all wrong and then said it was right enough and asked why the cover wasn\u2019t blue, and I laughed like a man who had not spent three hours last week arguing about a title with the patience of a parson. On the way back she fell asleep the way only people who have earned it can, and I watched the red cliff faces perform their geology for men who take photographs of themselves in front of cliffs, and I decided that the next time the river sulked I would remind it that we are all behaving as best we can.\n\nLinda\u2019s cat learned a new way to look offended that involved an entire ear and the tilt of a head. She sent me a picture of him wearing, with the toleration of a saint, a ribbon that said \u201cSUPPORT STAFF,\u201d because she had been elected vice-chair of the parish fete committee by mistake and required moral muscle. Aunt Joy took up tap on a Wednesday morning class populated entirely by women who had learned that if you laugh first you get to control the joke, and sent us all a video of her feet functioning like punctuation under a sentence that had never previously known where to stop. Imogen raised her prices by ten pence and apologised in chalk for three days, and then allowed herself to be forgiven on the fourth and slept like a tree.\n\nWe did the first event for The Cupboard in Bristol in a shop that used to be a bakery and had not forgotten. People came wearing their best cardigans, some of them newly knitted into bravery, and brought their griefs in pockets and handbags like responsible citizens. I read the piece about the watch and the fork and the list of things you can do when the day is stubborn; Eliot stood at the back with Anu and made a face at a sentence I had not known I could write and mouthed \u201cYes,\u201d which, from him, is like receiving a state honour that has learned humility. Afterwards a woman with a voice like early birds told me she had wound her husband\u2019s pocket watch for the first time since he died and had expected a feeling like a poem and experienced instead a feeling like a shopping list, and we stood together in that and decided it was fair.\n\nAt the second event a man asked a weaponised question about whether kindness isn\u2019t just a way of prettifying complicity and whether there were not better uses for our breath. I told him that kindness is a technique for not killing each other on the way to the argument we ought to have, and that I am in favour of ferocity but have found it makes a better tool when it sits in a drawer with string and tape and a pen that works. He harrumphed with academic zeal and bought two copies, one for a person he loved and one for a person he had not yet decided about, and when I signed them I wrote his name with too much care and hoped he noticed the insult I had refused to deliver and the respect I had delivered instead. On the train home I wrote a letter to the man who taught me to fold a map, which turned out to be my father disguised as a geography teacher I never had, and I cried in that rigid way men do when they suspect anyone might be watching, and nobody minded because there were swifts outside and a timetable to consider.\n\nThe watch ran down one night because I had not wound it, and the silence woke me at two with the delicacy of a burglar who is careful not to tread on toys. I lay there and listened to the not-tick and thought about daily work, about the lie of permanent fixes and the mercy of rituals you can go back to without apology. In the morning I wound it with intention and then wrote five hundred words before I looked at my phone, which is, in this economy, a revolution. When I did look, there was a message from Lerato with an attachment called \u201cCOVER_FINAL_FINAL\u201d and a sentence about a blurb that had made her cry, and a text from the officer at Parc with a photograph of The Cupboard page on the education room wall with a fresh column added by one of the men called \u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep,\u201d which included, \u201crescue a memory from a thing and let it stay out all night,\u201d and, \u201ctry to remember your mother\u2019s handwriting without going to find it.\u201d\n\nMay was ambitious and tried to be August for a week, which made Exeter behave like a Mediterranean city with a quiet sense of humour. Imogen put tables outside as if we were Paris and the penguin disapproved in a way that made passing dogs suspect him of leadership. Isaac finished his exams and read me a poem about fatigue that made a better case for rest than any doctor I have ever met, and his father shook my hand as if handing me the portion of pride he could not carry back to the car without spilling. Eliot and Anu came down for a weekend and slept in my spare room on a mattress that has ideas about people, and we went to Dawlish again because the trick with the trains never gets old if you\u2019re honest with yourself. On the sea wall he admitted he had said yes to the magazine\u2019s box and no one had died, and that he had spent his first two hours in it writing a shopping list in Latin because he had wanted to get the exhibitionism out of his system. Anu said she had made him a sandwich the shape of his better self and that he had eaten it without comment, which is the most flattering thing I have ever heard about a man in love.\n\nOn the last Friday of the month we did The Cupboard in a church hall with acoustic tiles and an unapologetic smell of boiled vegetables. The vicar was a woman with a laugh that had survived more light switches than I have ever flicked, and she told me that if I made one joke about God behaving like an absent landlord she would put money in the jar and call it theology. We made a long list together this time called \u201cWhat to do when your mouth doesn\u2019t know how to say it,\u201d and it included, \u201cteach your throat to behave with water,\u201d and \u201cborrow a sentence from a book and sit it in your mouth until it stops biting,\u201d and \u201cwrite \u2018I cannot say this yet\u2019 on a piece of paper and leave it where you will find it on a braver day.\u201d At the end, the vicar bought six copies and the man who had asked about complicity apologised with the softest voice available to him, and the penguin, who had been watching from a folding chair, looked as though he would permit one hymn and no more.\n\nJune, while we were looking the other way, crept in and lifted the light to that late angle that makes even the tiredest of us consider staying up. The swifts wrote their arguments above the quay and the river decided to be a mirror even when it was not, and we sat in the library\u2019s two chairs not facing each other and learned to let the room carry us. The book entered the world like any other domestic object that had been worked on and not ruined: it found its place and, occasionally, resisted being used for what it was meant for. People brought it back to me with fingerprints in the margins and accused me of getting away with short chapters, and teenagers sent me messages in which they thanked me for making lists look like a sufficient way to move through a day. I wrote to the man who had taught me to fold a map and to the teacher who had let me pretend I wasn\u2019t crying and to the boy who thought he had invented shame, and somewhere between the letters and the lists and the watch\u2019s quiet insistence, I forgot for a week to be on television and remembered entirely how to be in a room where someone has left a mug for you on the good shelf because they thought of you coming and decided to count that as joy.",

                              "content": "The morning the email arrived, the mist clung to the River Exe like breath on a mirror. The cathedral bells were still sulking about last night\u2019s vespers and the gulls were arguing over the end of a pasty someone had abandoned on the quay. That was Exeter in June: too much sky, too much history, everything the colour of postcards and old coins. I liked it like that. I liked the quiet, the illusion that I could hear my own sentences forming before they even wanted to be written down.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re early,\u201d Imogen said, chalking the specials board at the caf\u00e9, squinting towards me like it might wander off.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t sleep,\u201d I said. \u201cThere was a fox fight under my window. Sounded like a violin saw losing an argument with a cat.\u201d\n\nShe snorted and flicked a strand of red hair off her forehead. \u201cFlat white?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease. And those almond croissants that pretend they\u2019re not actually cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to call your agent and make her buy them for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me last week all I need is fresh air and patience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say this with love, Rowan: Clemency is a menace.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe gets me paid,\u201d I said, and sat by the big window where the river pretended to know me and the students did not. I opened my laptop; the screen blinked, indignant, and told me there were thirty-two new emails, three of them from my mother, one from my bank, and one with a subject line I didn\u2019t understand even when I read it twice.\n\nBritain\u2019s Got Talent \u2013 Final Invitation.\n\nI thought it was a prank. Of course I did. I closed the lid and opened it again like the machine might correct itself if I made it yawn. The subject line persisted, as brazen as a busker on Fore Street. Imogen set down the flat white and the almond croissant and leaned in until I could smell the coffee and her shampoo.\n\n\u201cBad news?\u201d she said, too cheerful.\n\n\u201cPotentially good news. Unlikely news. Very 2010-YouTube news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 a lot of adjectives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to break the unwritten code and read an email in public.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will be struck by lightning immediately.\u201d\n\nI clicked it open. The logo was there, red and blue and starry, and the greeting was formal in a way that made me sit up straighter. They referenced my audition months ago, the one I had nearly not gone to because my train had broken down near Taunton and I\u2019d had to get a lift in the back of a man\u2019s van that smelled of pine-scented cleaner and despair. They referenced the broadcast, the unexpected clip that had apparently gone viral because I told a story about my father and a blackbird in front of four judges who weren\u2019t expecting a story about my father and a blackbird. They wrote: We would be honoured if you would take part in the live final as our Judges\u2019 Wildcard.\n\nMy mouth worked before sound came out. \u201cThey want me,\u201d I said, a whisper to no one, and then louder: \u201cThey want me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Imogen said, craning her neck like a pole vaulter approaching the bar.\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d\n\nShe misheard. \u201cBritain\u2019s got salad?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh for\u2014 no. The show. The actual show.\u201d\n\nImogen put down the chalk. It rolled off the ledge and clattered onto the floor, a white scar on black tile. \u201cOh my God,\u201d she said. \u201cAre you joking? You hate talent shows.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate them.\u201d I tasted the lie, buttery. \u201cI hate the idea of being judged like a particularly anxious sponge cake by people I\u2019ve never met.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you watch that year with the dog who balanced on a bicycle?\u201d\n\nI thought of the dog, I thought of its eyes, the way its owner had looked like he might burst into confetti. I had watched, of course. We all had. I had also watched the year a comedian came third place and then sold out a tour in under three hours. We love to scoff; we love to be surprised. \u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd the opera singer. And the girl with the violin in flames.\u201d\n\nImogen took my wrist. \u201cYou\u2019re going to write something that makes them all cry and wash their faces with their sleeve ends in their living rooms like the nation at the end of a rainy war.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t have sleeve ends anymore. We do hoodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re deflecting. Call your agent. And also tell your mother. Preferably in that order.\u201d\n\nSo I did. I took my coffee outside because I felt too restless to be contained by four walls and someone else\u2019s music. The sky was undecided. Pigeons performed whatever family drama pigeons perform. I phoned Clemency first, because I am occasionally a professional.\n\nShe answered on the third ring. \u201cRowan. If this is about the invoice I forwarded, I swear on my favourite silk scarf\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not. They want me for the final.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho does?\u201d\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d\n\nA significant pause crackled down the line, followed by the sound of a drawer slamming, a thought being pulled tight. \u201cWell. That\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it madness?\u201d I said. \u201cBe honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be honest in layers. Layer one: exposure. Layer two: the booking fee, which is not dreadful. Layer three: legal. We will look at the contract and we will scrawl upon it like eighteenth-century clerks with gout. Layer four: what is your stomach doing?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomersaults. Headstands. That thing you tried to teach me at the Christmas party where you jump and twist and land and pretend you didn\u2019t nearly die.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my real question. Why did you audition in the first place if you were going to be this much of a stoat about it when they said yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought they would say no,\u201d I said, surprising myself with the rawness of it. \u201cI went because I\u2026 because it was a dare.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom myself. From Devon in January. From a page that wouldn\u2019t fill itself. I wanted to do something that didn\u2019t feel like being buried alive under polite reviews.\u201d\n\nClemency exhaled. \u201cThen the answer is yes. We say yes. We make the best suit out of it that we can. You write a piece that fists the country and pulls it forward by the scruff into some\u2026 adequate consolation. And you don\u2019t look at the comments.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never look at the comments.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa. You look at the comments like a man peeking under a door for monsters. I\u2019ll call you in an hour. Send me the email.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will.\u201d I paused. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ll embarrass myself?\u201d\n\n\u201cDaily, darling. But never for the wrong reasons.\u201d\n\nI rang off and phoned my mother and told her before she saw it on Facebook from Linda who lives down the road and collects porcelain hedgehogs. Mum cried a little, which is her honestly, and then said she would record it for Aunt Joy and could she come up to London and sit in the audience.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d I said, already imagining her knitting something inappropriate during the ad breaks. \u201cIt might be complicated. There are forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will you read?\u201d she said, the old worry under the new cheerfulness. \u201cNot the one about the divorce. Your uncle Nigel didn\u2019t understand that one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo that one about the blackbird.\u201d\n\n\u201cI might do\u2026 something else,\u201d I said, because I was superstitious and because I had promised it to myself. \u201cSomething new.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t forget to eat before you go on live television. I\u2019ll send you some of my flapjacks. They travel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a famine, Mum.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey travel,\u201d she said, which is to say, this is love, accept it.\n\nAfter the calls, I walked. Past the Cathedral Green where teenagers lay in reckless formations like punctuation after exams. Past the second-hand bookshop that always smelled faintly of soup and tender embarrassment. Past the charity shop where in the window a mannequin wore a sequinned dress that had once had a story, probably involving a night with too much karaoke and the sort of dancing that leaves you grateful to be alive in the morning. Exeter is full of previously loved things. It makes a person think.\n\nI think that year had made me smaller. The book had not done badly, if you measured the success of a book by the number of paperbacks standing to attention in the Staff Picks section with a Post-it note that said: Beautiful! Good for Dad! or by the number of times a man in a fleece at a village fair told me he had read it on his Kindle and liked the bit with the cat. But there is a way in which the internet and the London parties and the rush of it all take your face and flatten it into a caricature you stop recognising. I had moved back to Exeter to remember the smell of yeast in the morning, the way the tide finally gives in, the quiet joy of writing something that only a few people might ever read and it not killing me.\n\nAnd then I had auditioned.\n\nIt was Ollie\u2019s fault; he runs the spoken-word night above the bicycle shop on Sidwell Street, the one with the dangerously uneven stair. He had said, \u201cDo something public for once,\u201d and I had said, \u201cYou\u2019re insufferable,\u201d and then I had found myself in a queue of people with tap shoes and dogs and an illusionist who tried to guess my PIN and got it wrong twice and then got it right, which I do not think about because it makes the back of my neck prickle. I told my blackbird story to the four judges and an audience who looked like they had been trained to enjoy things. The first judge said something about truth and the second judge asked if my father was watching which made me think about grief on television. The audience stood up, some of them, like men in churches who have forgotten the hymn but stand anyway because everyone else is standing. Somebody backstage hugged me. I went home and hid for a week.\n\nNow there was this email and my phone was a drum.\n\nBack at the flat, the foxes had retreated to wherever they retreat during God\u2019s sensible hours and the neighbour\u2019s baby had given up crying so completely I held my breath until I heard a small noise and could breathe again. My desk was in the window and from it I could see the top of the cathedral and, if I stood, the river lifting and lowering whatever driftwood it had persuaded into a relationship. I opened a new document on the laptop. The empty page was a mouth.\n\nI typed: What is the strangest thing you have ever believed about yourself, and who told you it was true?\n\nIt sat there, slightly ridiculous. It reminded me of the sort of questions teenagers scrawl on the covers of their maths books when they are meant to be doing equations. I deleted it and wrote: In Exeter, the swifts arrive in a rush as if somebody remembered to turn on a switch in the sky.\n\nThat was better. Not original in the way that makes people weep, but true. There is a way you can start something that tells a listener they may unclench their jaw because you will be kind. Or at least, you will not be needlessly cruel. I wrote for twenty minutes, and for twenty minutes I forgot the email and the judges and the country and my bank balance and the way you are always performing even as you pretend not to be.\n\nThe baby upstairs resumed the measurable, healthy crying of the well looked after. I made a sandwich. I made tea. I sent the email to Clemency. She sent back seven questions, each with two sub-clauses and the sort of bold-typed phrases that make a person grateful and itchy. I put my phone face down and forced myself to write another paragraph.\n\nAt two in the afternoon, there was a knock that sounded like a boy about to apologise for breaking a window. It was Ollie in a jacket with elbow patches and a grin that made me pity his students. He teaches English at the college and has the air of a man who will smuggle a poem into your pockets while you are busy buying chips.\n\n\u201cIs it true?\u201d he said, shoulders already shaping themselves into a story he would tell later.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said. \u201cIt is ridiculous and true.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to write about Exeter on national television? Because I swear to God, if you turn us into a rustic clich\u00e9 I will\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThrow a cream tea at me? Yes. Unhelpful. Also please don\u2019t. Scones stain.\u201d\n\nHe came in without asking because that\u2019s the sort of friend he is and sat at my table and looked at the blank document like it was a slow dog. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought\u2014 I think\u2014 something new. Something that\u2019s shaped like a conversation you might have with the version of yourself that stopped believing it could be anything at thirteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is simultaneously specific and vague.\u201d\n\n\u201cVague is a writer\u2019s tool.\u201d\n\n\u201cVague is what you use when you haven\u2019t got to the heart of it and you\u2019re scared you won\u2019t be able to.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you. Do you practice this? You should be a therapist and undercharge on purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d he said, softening. \u201cListen. I\u2019m pleased for you beyond reason. And I also want to ask if you\u2019re ready for the fact that people will not understand what you\u2019re doing and will shout at their televisions about you being a man who reads instead of a person who sings and then will go online and say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a man who reads instead of a person who sings my whole life. At least now there will be a costume.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of those micro-phones that fit over your ear and make you look like a secret agent borrowing your own face?\u201d\n\n\u201cExactly.\u201d I held my own ear as if measuring for something. \u201cDo you\u2026 want to listen?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo you reading? Yes. To you floundering? Also yes. I\u2019m a complex friend.\u201d\n\nI read him the swifts. I read him the thought about thirteen. I read him a paragraph about my grandfather\u2019s watch that had not yet found its purpose. He cried a little, because he is carefully constructed to appear gruff and is actually a puddle with eyebrows. When he had finished crying, he looked at me with the expression he wears when a student writes something that makes him feel like the world might not be such a tired machine after all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not finished,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not finished,\u201d he agreed, \u201cand it\u2019s still\u2026 it\u2019s a start that could be an ending. You often start like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think it\u2019s good?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s you. I think it\u2019s you doing the thing your mother calls showing off and your worst reviewer calls self-absorbed and your best reader calls home.\u201d\n\nWhen he left, the late light had begun to do that thing it does in June where it makes you feel like nothing is permitted to end. I wrote. I wrote until my wrist hurt and my shoulder clicked and the rented flat smelled faintly of ink because I had pulled out the old fountain pen to stop myself from checking my email. When I finally sat back, the paragraph about the watch had become a list of the things I had thought would measure me: exam results; first kisses; word counts; the number of cities I could convincingly pretend to belong to; the speed at which I could forgive people; the ease with which I could forgive myself. It wasn\u2019t a list that would win anything. It might be a list that could hold someone for three minutes while they waited for the adverts to end and dinner to not burn.\n\nClemency phoned at half six and told me the contract was mostly reasonable and the part about rights was not dreadful and that she would insist on a clause that allowed me to read a specific piece without alteration. \u201cAlso,\u201d she said, \u201cavoid any casual use of the word \u2018bugger\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cI seldom use bugger casually,\u201d I said, which is true.\n\n\u201cAnd wear a jacket. Something that reminds people of their English teacher but less harried.\u201d\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we be careful? I don\u2019t want to look like I am in costume as someone safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are safe. They will have pyro on stage. You are the opposite of pyro. That is your advantage.\u201d\n\nAfter I put down the phone, I went for another walk. I went up to the top of the hill where the allotments hold themselves quiet. A man was watering runner beans; he had that absorbed expression of someone who has been given a task and wants desperately to do it right. He glanced up and nodded as if to say: yes, we are all trying. A girl with a purple streak in her hair sat on the grass and blasted music that used to be called grime and is now called something else, because time forgets us so gently. I stood and watched the city be itself. You can go to London for the feeling that the whole world is happening at once like a party where you might miss the most important thing if you even blink. Exeter gives you the feeling that there is a book open on a table somewhere and you have time to read it and maybe pass it along.\n\nBack at the flat, I showered and put on a T-shirt that had survived longer than some friendships. I ate pasta and watched a quiz show where no one won more than a hundred pounds and still seemed delighted to have been on the television. I went to bed with my phone across the room like a child in time-out. I dreamt about being in a library where all the books were unlabelled and I had to guess which was mine by the weight.\n\nIn the morning, the mist burned clean off the river. I woke with a sentence stuck to my tongue like a seed. I reached for the notebook by the bed and wrote: You are not what you win.\n\nIt looked too obvious and also like the answer to a riddle I hadn\u2019t asked properly yet. The kettle complained itself into a bit of purpose. The email arrived from the show\u2019s producer with times and dress rehearsals and a reminder that there would be a meeting with the judges\u2019 team and would I be so good as to bring two options for my piece so their standards and practices department could have a moment to panic at leisure.\n\nI phoned my mother again and told her to please, please not tell anyone until the announcement was official. She agreed and then accidentally told Linda who told Aunt Joy who sent me a message that contained only a string of confetti emojis and a picture of her cat wearing a fascinator. I forwarded it to Imogen who wrote back: If the cat is available to stand in for you, that could be plan B.\n\nAt lunchtime, I took the train to Paignton and back for no reason other than the movement helps. The man opposite me ate a sausage roll slowly and then fell asleep with his mouth slightly open and I wanted to write him down, to put him in a story where he gets precisely what he wants and it is not a sausage roll. The carriage rocked. The windows did their best to show me the sea.\n\nWhen I got home, there was an envelope under my door with Ollie\u2019s handwriting. Inside it, there were three photos from the open-mic night last winter. In one of them, I am reading with my head tilted as if listening for something. In one, I am laughing at something someone else is saying and my shoulder is relaxed, which is so rare in photographs of me I put it on the fridge for my own reassurance. He\u2019d written on the back of the third: You are allowed to take up space without apologising. Also bring spare pens.\n\nThe second day after the email, I got a text that made the back of my neck heat up as if a small sun had rolled right behind me and waited. It wasn\u2019t from the show. It was from a number that I hadn\u2019t saved and yet recognised in a muscle deep enough I had to sit down.\n\nHeard a rumour. E x.\n\nE x was not a typo. It was Eliot Pike\u2019s way of performing his wit even with an initial. Eliot with one L and the o smoothed out like a pebble, a man who had once told me that \u2018Rowan Vale\u2019 sounded too much like a woodland and not enough like a person. He had been in my first workshop in London, the kind where everyone tries to hide their ambition under a cardigan. He had a laugh that made you feel like you\u2019d told the joke wrong. He had a way of owning the room that meant the room spent the rest of the day trying to get itself back. We had both applied for the same grant; he had got it and sent me a message that said: Hope there\u2019s a next time, which was to congratulations what margarine is to butter. We had both been shortlisted for the same prize; I had won; he had sent me a page-long letter about the things prizes cannot possibly measure which, at the time, I had thought magnanimous until someone pointed out the sting at the end where he had told me, gently, that my work was \u201cgood company for train journeys.\u201d\n\nThe rumour, I guessed, was my rumour.\n\nI put the phone on the table like you might put down something heavy you didn\u2019t mean to lift. And then I did the thing I had told Clemency I would not do. I typed his name into the search bar of the internet and watched it produce a small circus. There he was in a velvet jacket on a radio show. There he was in black and white, the darling of a magazine that still pretended it didn\u2019t read its own press releases. There was a post from a production assistant of a televised talent show, blurred faces in a corridor, captioned: This line-up is going to be ridiculous, accompanied by metadata that made my stomach feel like I had swallowed a hedgehog.\n\nIt would not be him, I told myself. He would not lower himself to stand on the same stage that dog had balanced a bicycle. Eliot would host an untelevised salon where the art would be too delicate to be broadcast. He would\u2014\n\nMy phone buzzed again. From Clemency this time, blessedly human. Call me when you can, she wrote. And nothing else. Not an emoji, not even a dot.\n\nI phoned. She answered at once. \u201cDon\u2019t say anything until I have said something,\u201d she said, which is a sentence that never means good news. \u201cAnd don\u2019t throw your phone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d I looked at the phone in my hand the way a person looks at a dog that is about to bolt. \u201cClemency?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe show wants you. That hasn\u2019t changed. The show also wants to be television. Which means it has to be full of stories people can read while they are boiling pasta. One such story is: Rivalry. Historical bad blood. The return. You see where I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re about to say a name, aren\u2019t you.\u201d\n\nShe did. \u201cEliot Pike is also on the final. He is doing an \u2018experimental narrative performance\u2019. His words, not mine. He told the producers that he invented the genre of whatever you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems likely. He also invented the height of tables, the feeling of tasting fennel for the first time, and the concept of polite cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cRowan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I lied. \u201cI\u2019m not fine. How do we\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do nothing.\u201d She was the calm in my boat. \u201cYou write your piece. You dress like an adult. You do the thing you have to do to make yourself sleep at night. If you allow him into your head you will put him on stage with you. He does not deserve to be on stage with you unless he paid for the ticket.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be easier for the show if he\u2019s the villain.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will be easier for everyone if we don\u2019t play along with anyone\u2019s plan to make you anything other than the man who talks about swifts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wrote something this morning,\u201d I said, and I told her the line from the notebook. There was a silence at the end of it like the silence you get at the top of a hill.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cGood. Put it on a Post-it. Stick it somewhere. Read it every time his name tries to colonise your mood.\u201d\n\nAfter we hung up, I sat at the desk and watched the river pull itself along. My chest had that buzz in it like a hive you are not exactly sure belongs to you. I could see the story unrolling in the papers: once-friends-at-odds, Devon vs. Dalston, two men with words in their mouths like teeth. I could see people picking sides, as if there were sides to pick, as if we were a football match and not two people pretending to be less fragile than we are. I could feel the tug\u2014perform the argument, take back the room that time he took, settle it finally in the place where you hope television might bear witness.\n\nI made tea. I ate an apple. I did not look at my phone. I opened the document and I read the swifts and the watch and the list and the line I had written in the morning. I cut a paragraph that was clever and cruel and would have gotten me a laugh and an email from my mother. I put in a sentence about my father\u2019s garden fork leaning against a shed through a decade of weather. I put in one about the exact sound of an audience holding its breath.\n\nI read it aloud. The room held me. My kitchen table, my plant that I had finally kept alive for more than a year, the chair with the scrape on the back from when I had moved in: they were the small and domestic audience that will tell you if you are lying. I do not think I was lying yet.\n\nThe next days were a blur of practice and emails and avoiding the part of the internet that wanted to tell me what to do with myself. Imogen brought me a cake with the Union Jack iced on top in a way that made it look like it had been run over by a bike. \u201cPatriotic,\u201d she said. \u201cSymbolic. Tastier than the actual Union.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not be eating sugar before a live television broadcast,\u201d I said, and then I ate two slices and gave the rest to the seagulls.\n\nOllie stood in my kitchen and clapped me between paragraphs. He threw a tea towel at my head when I got too solemn. He pretended to be each of the judges and said things like, \u201cTell me why you\u2019re doing this now,\u201d in a voice that verged on sinister and then laughed at his own acting. Clemency sent me pictures of jackets. My mother posted a picture of a cake tin to our family WhatsApp group and wrote: Practising. There was a breeze through the city that made the bunting flicker even where there was no bunting.\n\nOn the Friday before the Sunday of the final, I took the train to London. The carriage was crowded with bright children and tired parents and one man with a saxophone that did not, at any point, erupt into music. The fields unrolled like someone\u2019s idea of consolation. On my lap was a folder with two versions of a thing that could, if I stood right and breathed, carry me through three minutes and thirty seconds.\n\nAs the train pulled into Paddington, my phone buzzed again. A message from a number I had not saved because I know myself: Eliot. Good luck, it said, and below that, unkindly, the picture of a thumbs-up.\n\nI typed nothing in response. I put the phone in my pocket. I got off the train into a city that smelled of metal and late plans and held my bag tighter so I would not forget who it belonged to.\n\nIn the hotel room paid for by television, I watched myself in the mirror. You do not have to like him, I told the reflection. You don\u2019t even have to feel anything at all about him. You are allowed to feel everything else. I put on the jacket that made me look like a teacher and a cousin. I put the second version of the piece back in the folder and then took it out again and then put it back, which in the world of the undecided stands in for faith.\n\nI walked to a park near the studio and read under a plane tree while teenagers performed the ritual of pretending to be indifferent to each other and adults performed the ritual of thinking about not going back to work and then doing it anyway. On a bench, a man fed a small child banana slices and ate the ones that fell in his own lap like a person who has learned the economies of love. I breathed. I said hello to a dog in my head so that I would be the kind of person who says hello to a dog.\n\nWhen the call came to go into the studio for the technical rehearsal, I had already walked through the piece enough that my mouth knew where it was going. The stage swallowed me in that way stages do, the lights like warm fists, the seating rising, empty, like the promise of a storm. A person with a headset said my name to someone I could not see in a voice that meant we were now a show and not this day in my life. I stood on the taped cross on the floor and looked at the camera with its apathetic eye and tried not to imagine anyone hiding behind it, ready to judge and ready, too, to be kind if I gave them the instruction.\n\n\u201cSound check,\u201d a man said, and I said, \u201cExeter\u201d and \u201cswifts\u201d and \u201cblackbird,\u201d and the words hung there, audible even in this air that smelled of electricity and old plastic.\n\nOn a riser to my left, someone said, \u201cRowan. You look exactly the same,\u201d and I didn\u2019t have to turn to know who it was, though of course I did turn, because I am polite.\n\nEliot stood there in a black shirt that did not belong to any shop I could afford and trousers that looked like he had borrowed them from a dancer. He smiled in that way of his that meant: see me noticing you.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said, the two words as lined up as I could make them.\n\nHe came down the steps, two at a time. \u201cI\u2019m glad they did the sensible thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes for a better narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they call it a \u2018package\u2019,\u201d I said, because I have a petty part that wanted him to hear me say their word with my mouth. \u201cWe\u2019ll try not to ruin their edit.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d I asked at the same time, and then we both were quiet for a second and I thought of being nineteen and in a kitchen at a party where everyone is performing their cleverness and the single mercy is someone handing you a glass of water unironically.\n\n\u201cSomething honest,\u201d he said, which was his joke, and his not-joke. \u201cTry not to be sentimental,\u201d he added, lightly, like a man recommending a dessert.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure what you think that word means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know exactly what it means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what you do. You domesticate feeling and take it for a walk on a lead.\u201d\n\nHe stood there, handsome and infuriating, and I felt the old doors in me shift. There it was, the invitation to fight inside his sentences. I shook my head like a man shaking rain from his ears. \u201cHave a good rehearsal,\u201d I said, and I meant it more than I wanted to.\n\nHe watched me walk to my tape mark. He clapped once, the sound swallowed by the empty room. The person with the headset said, \u201cFrom the top, please,\u201d and I breathed, because somewhere between Exeter and here I had decided to be the person who does not pretend they are not always breathing for the first time.\n\nYou are not what you win, I thought. You are not what you win. You are the man who will go home and write again. The technical cue light blinked. The time ticked down. I opened my mouth. And said what I had to say.",

                              "content": "The first run-through felt like taking a pulse in a hurricane. I knew where my breath went and where the jokes were, the small pockets of air where people might laugh and forgive me for letting them. I knew the cadence I wanted for the sentence about the watch, the place where I wanted to pause so the old man watering his runner beans could walk across the stage of other people\u2019s imaginations and take his time. On the empty seats a crew member had taped sheets of paper with names written in thick black marker, and reading to those names was like reading to ghosts who had bought their tickets early. A woman with a headset and the patient expression of a midwife leaned close to remind me that the red light meant yes and the floor edge meant no and that if the pyro went off for the dance troupe before me I would see the scorch marks and not to be alarmed because everything was under control. I thanked her as if she had personally invented control.\n\nAfterwards, Nisha from Standards and Practices took me aside to say, only slightly apologetically, that \u201cdamn\u201d was probably acceptable but we should lose \u201cbloody\u201d in the context of my grandfather\u2019s watch because they were keen on keeping the pre-watershed audience on our side. I told her that would be fine, and we stood for a moment looking at the taped X on the stage that was mine as if it were an ambiguous omen. She was kind in that unshowy way people are kind when their whole job is to prevent catastrophe without ever appearing on camera. When I told her I\u2019d once said \u201cbugger\u201d on local radio by accident and that the presenter had pretended he hadn\u2019t heard, she laughed, and it felt like the studio exhaled with us.\n\nThe green room was less green than I wanted, more beige and snack-coloured, bowls of crisps and grapes and chocolate bars making a low offer to every nervous system in the place. On one sofa, a magician practised shuffling with a deck so worn it looked like a family heirloom; next to him, a woman in a sequinned leotard folded herself into a shape that made everyone else sit up straighter out of respect. A child with a ventriloquist\u2019s dummy on his knee watched cartoons on a tablet with the sort of concentration that could have powered a small town, while his mother asked him, every four minutes, if he needed the toilet. A choir arrived late and breathed as one organism while their choirmaster held up his hands like a man holding back heavy machinery. Everyone had a ritual. Mine was to drink water and then drink more water and then put the bottle down and forget which bottle was mine and start again.\n\nEliot appeared, of course, in a sigh of other people\u2019s attention. He wore black in a way that suggested it cost more than my rent and had been steamed by someone with a postgraduate degree. He didn\u2019t look at me as he talked to his director, or he did but only in split-second glances that were a kind of currency. It was a relief, terrible and pure, the way you feel when you realise that a person you have been braced to hate is just another person navigating the snacks and the lighting gel and the producers who say things like, \u201cCan you give me that again but with even more sense of\u2026 stakes?\u201d I watched him rehearse a line in the corridor that I recognised from an event the year before where he\u2019d stood in front of an audience on a barge and told them about a man who mistook longing for taste. It was better now. He is, I have to admit, good at what he does. It made me love what I do harder.\n\nI escaped into a stairwell that smelled like dust and floor polish and texted Imogen a photograph of my shoes because they looked like a teacher\u2019s shoes in an advert for adulthood. She replied, immediately: You could hide a small dictionary in those. Also do you want me to send you a picture of the scones I made to keep my hands busy while you do something terrifying? I told her I did, and she sent me an image of three ambitious scones, one leaning slightly, all dusted with sugar like a blessing. The kindness of people who cannot get to a television studio but can get to an oven is not to be underestimated.\n\nBefore the dress rehearsal, there was a meeting with one of the judges\u2019 producers, a woman whose cardigan gave away nothing. She sat me down in a corner that had somehow been furnished like a quiet room and asked what I wanted people to know about me in three sentences or fewer. I told her I was from Devon and that I liked rivers and that I was sorry. She smiled and said, \u201cWe can work with Devon and rivers.\u201d Then she asked if I had a message. It is hard to be asked that question without wanting to become a sandwich board. I said something about not measuring joy in units they can sell you, and she made a note with a very nice pen and reminded me that if any of the judges asked about Eliot I could say I was excited to perform on the same night as someone I respect. I practised saying it and found it did not kill me.\n\nThe dress rehearsal taught me the precise length of three minutes and thirty seconds. It is not very long, and it is forever. They miked me up, the pale loop over my ear like the ghost of a fishhook, and checked the tape for my name a third time. The lighting operator walked me through the journey my face would take from shadow to clarity; he called it a build, and I watched the floor dots glow and then turn shy. It was impossible not to think of school plays and church halls and those charity gala nights in which I had leaned into a microphone that smelled of beer and begged it to behave. The director, a man with hair that looked exactly as expensive as his patience, asked if I would be happy to take one step left at the end of the second paragraph so the camera could find me. I said I would be happy to take one step left at any time if someone would simply tell me when to do it. He laughed, and someone in a booth said, \u201cCopy that,\u201d and for a second it felt like the most beautiful machine in the world.\n\nThe hotel they\u2019d put me in had a soft-focus view of a railway line and a coffee machine that made a sound like a distant cow. The bed was too large and too clean for me to sleep without suspicion, so I lay on top of the duvet reading the poem Eliot had published last month about a woman eating an orange in a train station. It was technically immaculate and emotionally unkind to everyone involved, including the orange. I put it down and picked up my own pages and changed a comma because the page wanted it and because changing things is a way the anxious make a shrine of control. When I turned off the light, the city hum sat outside the window like a cat I hadn\u2019t let in.\n\nIn the morning my mother phoned from a train that was both at Clapham Junction and nowhere at all. She told me Aunt Joy had bought a fascinator whose ambition outstripped its engineering and asked whether she was allowed to knit during the adverts. I told her that I loved her and that she had to promise, promise, not to accost any of the other contestants in the corridor and give them toffees from her bag. She said she could not promise it but would try. In the background I could hear the sound of Linda\u2019s travel mug clattering against something and a small explosion of laughter. I told them which queue to join and which line to say when the security guard asked who they were there for and wrote it out on a piece of paper as if they would have time to read my handwriting at the door.\n\nBack at the studio, David the stage manager handed me a mug of hot water with lemon and honey and informed me without preamble that he had done seventeen series and that in his experience the difference between the people who enjoyed themselves and the people who did not was not talent but the decision to enjoy themselves. He had eyes like the sky over Exeter when it had finally made up its mind to be kind and a pencil behind his ear that looked like an extra finger. He told me a story about a man who had frozen mid-song and then recovered by telling the audience he had imagined them in their underpants and found them disappointingly fashionable, and how the audience had loved him for the confession. \u201cIf you forget,\u201d he said, \u201ctell them. They love to be told the truth from people who look like you.\u201d\n\nAn hour before the live show, they took us to the stage for a last walk-through. From the wings I could see the seats filling, the audience learning their lines from the warm-up comic who stood on the stage like a minister at the altar of laughter and taught them to cheer when a hand went up and boo when a cue line suggested scandal. They practised clapping, which you would think the nation had already got the hang of, but it turns out we like to be told when and how to be enthusiastic if we suspect our enthusiasm might otherwise be inefficient. The judges took their seats to the sort of entrance music that says: you will tell stories about having been in the presence of this personality. The camera swooped; the floor thrummed. Someone brushed powder along my forehead and asked me questions I couldn\u2019t hear because my heart had turned itself up to be heard over my head.\n\nI saw my mother. It was not likely, and it was also inevitable. She was in row H, wearing a cardigan that had been nice before she wore it to death and hair she had done herself with more optimism than technique. Aunt Joy\u2019s fascinator looked like the spaceship in a science-fiction film where the heroine keeps a diary. Next to them, a woman who might have been Linda or a saint waved at me with a handkerchief she had probably brought in case anyone cried. When my mother saw me seeing her she did that thing she has done since I was five years old, where she made a face that included the whole story of my existence in one expression and then made a small fist and pumped it as if we were at a football match and the team had finally learned to pass.\n\nI stood on the X when they told me to stand on the X. The noise of the room changed. It is a strange sound, the sound a crowd makes when it decides to listen as one person. The red light on the camera became a small, benign planet. The music dropped away and I could hear only the soles of my shoes on the floor and a man in the back row coughing the kind of cough that insists on its own innocence. The host said my name in the shape the nation had decided to give it. The applause came and went like a tide. Somewhere, thousands of people adjusted themselves on sofas, picked a bit of dinner from a plate, looked at me without looking at me. I breathed.\n\nI said: In Exeter, the swifts arrive in a rush as if somebody remembered to flick the switch and turn on the sky, and you can feel the city notice. People don\u2019t look up enough, but they do that day. You can hear it, the noticing, the way we hear the bin lorry, the way we hear the person we love coming up the stairs and, even before they put the key in the door, we prepare our faces to be kind.\n\nI told them the thing I had to tell them about being thirteen and believing the worst thing I could be was not clever but ordinary, and no one thought to correct me because it sounded like a kind of ambition. I said that if you asked me to list the things that had measured me I could give you a catalogue that would make your fingers ache: test scores, library cards, the number of times I could hold a person\u2019s eye without looking away, the ages at which I gave things up and the ages at which I learned to pick them back up without apologising. People smiled in the front row in that way people do when their faces remember a room they used to be in.\n\nI told them about my grandfather\u2019s watch leaning in a drawer for a decade because I was afraid to wind it. I told them about my father\u2019s garden fork standing against the shed through weather so attentive it grew us into whatever we had managed to be. I told them about a blackbird because if you\u2019re given a stage this large you might as well bring someone you love with you. He used to sing into our kitchen like he was on a mission to improve the boiling of potatoes and we, stupidly, thought he would be available forever. I said the word father once and felt the room hold itself like a pan lifted off the boil and then set gently back down.\n\nI said, You are not what you win. You are not what you fail to win. You are not even, on the worst days, what the worst person thinks of you when they are having their worst day. You are the person who, quietly, without permission, grows a life like ivy along a fence you didn\u2019t know you wanted until it was there. You are the person who writes a list of small mercies and then reads it twice, out loud, in a kitchen, to a plant that has decided to live. This is not a trick and it is not an apology. It is the opposite of a trick. It is the cupboard we keep the good mugs in. It is ordinary, which is to say, it will save us.\n\nI finished at the place where the piece finished, a place it had chosen for itself, and the build on the lights did what it had promised. For a second that was so dense it felt like a physical object, there was nothing, no sound but the metal of the rig cooling and the microscopic shift of a hundred postures. Then the audience did the thing audiences do with relief and clapping and the occasional involuntary noise that comes out of a person when they have to. The host walked in from the wings with that balance of sincerity and performance he keeps in his pocket. I remembered to step left, and the camera found me like a bird landing exactly where it means to. Someone in row H stood up too quickly and then sat down again with their whole body in a blush.\n\nThe judges made their noises. The comedian judge said he had not planned to cry on a Sunday but that at least the nation would not mistake him for a statue, and he made a joke about his mascara that made everyone love him more. The music judge said my piece was a song without music and that her mother would phone her immediately to tell her I reminded her of someone whose name I did not catch. The impresario judge, whose teeth could have lit a minor motorway, said that I had a gift for making the small things large and the large things small, which is not what art is supposed to do and also exactly what it does when it is behaving. The fourth judge, who has won awards for being sensible in public, told me that she had written down a line and that she would not say which one because private things are allowed on television if you decide they are. I thanked them in the order I had been told to thank them and did not try to be clever because cleverness is shy in this kind of light and runs away if you make eye contact.\n\nBackstage, the man with the lemon and honey put the mug back into my hand and said, \u201cThat went,\u201d and I could not disagree. I had a spasm of shaking that was not fit for the camera and hid behind a curtain that had seen too much to judge me. Someone from digital content asked if they could film a clip of me giving advice to my younger self and I said later, which is a thing I have learned to say only recently. My phone did what it always does when I am briefly visible to more people than usual; it filliped with messages like a fish in a net. I did not look. Clemency arrived in a gust of perfume and relief and told me not to look at anything not wearing a nametag.\n\nEliot touched my elbow. He had watched from the wings and he was good enough to wait until my face had come back. He said, \u201cI liked the line about the cupboard,\u201d and it was the kindest thing he had said to me in five years and I wanted both to bite him and to tell him it was about my mother and the mugs she will not allow anybody else to wash. He was already moving away, his body adjusting itself for the camera\u2019s appetite. In the distance, his own set waited, all angles and blackness and a chair with more meaning than chairs generally have. I went to sit in the green room and shared crisps with the child ventriloquist while his dummy practised blinking. The acrobat cracked her back like a brief thunderclap and told me that nerves were proof of respect. The choir sang a quiet G under their breath like a hymn for people in corridors.\n\nWatching Eliot from the monitor is a dangerous sport if your heart has already done enough work for the week. He did what he does, which is make language into a knife that somehow, when it cuts you, reveals something you had wanted to see. He leaned on a sentence as if it were furniture. He talked about hunger and fashion and a photograph of himself at nineteen that he had kept in a drawer for when he needed to remember what not to do. He was merciless, including to the version of himself he brought out like evidence. The audience laughed when he asked them to and sighed when he permitted it, and I hated every second that I admired him. When he finished, the room made a noise as if it had discovered a brand-new way to agree about something.\n\nIf there was a narrative, it had improved itself in the edit. The host threw to an advert break with the speed of a man catching a falling plate. I could feel the nation stand up and collect bowls and have opinions. The part of me that is a medieval peasant looked for portents in the signs, counted the cheers, measured the humidity, watched the tiny rain that was confetti from the dance troupe floating down through lights to stick to the taped X on the stage like snow that had gone to finishing school. The part of me that is a person tried to remember the train back to Exeter and whether I had left the heating set to reasonable.\n\nBetween the live performances and the voting come the interviews that look spontaneous and smell of planning. In ours the host asked if we were friends and we did the thing where we laughed and said we respected each other\u2019s work and kept our bodies still and behaved like adults. Eliot made a quip about how television loves to pretend people live in binary and the audience clapped at the word pretend because it sounded like a commentary without requiring them to do anything about it. The camera moved on. The band played a song from a decade I do not feel old enough to call a decade. The crew rearranged the stage to make room for a man who would juggle knives and grief.\n\nBy the time the voting closed, I was so clean of expectation I could almost feel the aftertaste of it, the way you taste garlic the next day because it has colonised you in a pleasant way. I sat shoulder to shoulder with a boy who had stilt-walked in a suit that made him look like a friendly Greek god and held his hand because his mother asked me to. I ran into my own mother in a corridor because the universe will give you what you love when it can and because security are wonderful but cannot entirely contain Aunt Joy when she is wearing a hat that could guide sea traffic. They had found the free water and a marshal who used to live in Ottery St Mary had said something that had made my mother decide he would come to Christmas. She pressed a gift into my pocket, something wrapped in kitchen towel and warm like it had been next to her skin. Later, in the half-light of backstage, I unwrapped it and found one of her flapjacks, the top shiny with syrup, and I bit into it in front of a woman from makeup who said, \u201cOh, love,\u201d like a blessing.\n\nWe went back to the stage for the announcement. The lights did their thousand-eye thing and the floor gleamed and the host said words that became only rhythm because we had all forgotten our native tongue and had replaced it with this one. The finalists stood in a line like a new sort of choir. I could see the drummer for the house band chewing gum as if he were trying to bring the heart rate of the whole building down by a fraction. The host read out names and people stepped forward and the audience did what it had been taught. Eliot\u2019s profile, viewed sideways, looked like a statue of a man making a sensible point. I had the sudden distinct impression that, whatever happened, I would sleep and not wake up inside a verdict. Maybe it was only the flapjack talking. Maybe it was the sentence I had taped to the inside of my skull. Maybe it was that Exeter had come with me after all, swifts humming over the river, the Cathedral bells sulking, Imogen chalking a specials board as if she could boss the day into being good.\n\nWhen the red light blinked its important blink and the host took a breath that promised everyone a memory, I looked into the camera and thought of the cupboard with the good mugs in it and the person I had been who did not know you could choose to be kind to him. The hand came down on the envelope like a gavel on a mercy. The room drew its breath in with the theatre of a storm. I stood where I had been told to stand and, quietly, made myself ready to go home and write again.",

                              "content": "They said a name that was not mine and I felt, with a clarity almost medical, something inside me sit down. The lights did their theatre and the room made the sound that rooms make when they choose a story to keep, and all of it was both enormous and very far away, like thunder on the other side of a valley. I clapped for the boy with the voice that had made the balcony vibrate; I clapped for the choir who had made something communal out of breath; I clapped, with a kind of relieved ferocity, because my hands knew what to do while the rest of me recalibrated. There was a camera in my face for the \u201creaction,\u201d and I arranged mine like crockery on a draining board: sincere, not tragic, usable. Somewhere to my left, Eliot put on the expression that has seen him through prize nights and bad wine, and the host said things about journeys and how far we had all come, and I remembered suddenly, stupidly, the train from Taunton and the smell of pine cleaner and despair in the back of a van.\n\nThey herded us off with admirable efficiency, as if handling a flock that had to be got to a gate before the weather turned. In the corridor, the music sounded like it was being played down a metal tube; in the green room, it sounded like nothing at all because everybody was too busy swallowing. The child with the ventriloquist\u2019s dummy asked me if I was famous now, and I said I was famous for at least the duration of a bus ride, which made his mother laugh into her sleeve like a person who had been waiting for permission to. Clemency appeared with her arms already out and her phone already full, and she kissed my cheek and told me she was maternal with pride and allergic to disappointment and that my mentions would be a small bonfire we would not stand too close to. She gave me the wrap-up: trending, the judges had been kind, there was a producer from a radio programme who wanted me the next week, and a stranger had emailed her to say I had made him stop drinking straight out of the saucepan and get a glass.\n\nMy mother found me despite every barrier designed to keep mothers from finding their sons in television buildings. She had acquired a lanyard by smiling at a person who did not know how to deal with a woman who thanked him for his service as though he were returning from a mission. Aunt Joy\u2019s fascinator had slid imperceptibly to port and the effect was of a ship that had seen something extraordinary on the horizon and leaned towards it. They were incandescent with the kind of joy that only partly requires facts. My mother put both her hands on my face and said, \u201cYou were beautiful,\u201d which is a thing it is very hard to hear at any age and not become briefly three years old. Aunt Joy declared, with the certainty of someone whose entire experience of showbusiness had just occurred, that the nation had fallen in love with me and could do what it liked about it.\n\nEliot and I crossed paths by the precious water cooler, that diplomatic zone where every emotion has to take off its shoes. He looked exactly like a man who had been very nearly turned into a story and had only partly enjoyed the sensation. For once his precision wobbled and I could see the person under the press cuttings, a man with a habit of wrinkling his nose when he was thinking hard. He said, \u201cYou were very good,\u201d in a tone that was almost ordinary, and I said, \u201cYou were too,\u201d and for the first time since the barge, neither of us tried to make the compliment into a competition. It felt like someone had unthreaded a wire that had been tightened between us for so long we had forgotten it was there. Then a runner asked him to stand under a light and say something about the experience of the experience, and he was gone, unblinking in the new sun of attention.\n\nBy the time I had been collected, debriefed, congratulated and handed a tote bag with a bottle of something non-alcoholic and a T-shirt that was never going to suit me, the backstage had begun to empty of its adrenaline. A technician in a hoodie coiled cables as if they were snakes he had tamed with kindness. The floor was confettied with the evidence of other people\u2019s moments: a broken sequin, a sentence dropped like a feather, the skid mark of a heel that had tried to stop history. David the stage manager passed me and tipped his pencil as if it were a hat and said, \u201cTold you\u2014decision,\u201d and I wanted to hug him and also go somewhere my name was elastic again. Clemency kissed me once more and murmured that she would ring at eleven and noon and three tomorrow and to sleep with my phone far enough away that I could not hear it sulking. My mother tried to give me a Tupperware of egg sandwiches she had smuggled into the capital like contraband; security looked at me, I looked at security, and we all conspired to believe we lived in a world where such things were legal.\n\nIn the hotel room, the railway line moved past as if it were the last thing still committed to speed. I put the tote bag on a chair as if it were a guest and took the jacket off with the careful movements of a person taking off a personality. The quiet after that much light is not quiet at all; it\u2019s a tide going out and pulling the bones of the day with it. I washed the make-up off my face and was briefly surprised to find my face underneath, and then I ate my mother\u2019s egg sandwich out of the Tupperware with the grave gratitude of a pilgrim. The phone jittered on the desk like a bird getting ready to take off. I turned it face down and stood at the window and imagined the Exeter night, the river not pretending anything, Imogen closing the caf\u00e9 with a flourish that had much more to do with her than with the till.\n\nI slept like a person who had promised himself that sleep was not a verdict. When I woke, the city had remembered it was Monday and got on with it. Trains arrived and departed with the righteous noise of things that have purpose. I packed in that desultory way you pack when your suitcase and your heart disagree about where home is. On the train, my mother and Aunt Joy took possession of a table as if seating plans were a suggestion rather than a law. Aunt Joy shared anecdotal feedback from the women in Row H\u2014Apparently I have an honest neck and a kind stance\u2014and my mother read to me in fragments from messages relatives had sent from various edges of the country. Linda cried on and off like a defective tap and kept passing me items from her bag that did not immediately strike me as snacks but turned out to be snacks. We watched out of the window as the capital became fields with intention, and then hills with opinions, and then the soft domesticity of Devon sidled in like a cat forgiving you.\n\nBack in Exeter, the air had that washed feeling it sometimes gets after a weekend when the whole city has been lent to visitors and then returned. Imogen was outside the caf\u00e9 chalking a list of scones that read like a shortlist for a small, well-judged prize. When she saw me, she did not shout in the way I know she had been waiting to, because we are not that kind of town, but she did clap with her hands below the board, which only the seagulls and I could see. She made me sit down before I could pretend I had to go home to unpack, and she made me drink a coffee like an antidote and eat something that did not announce itself as cake until it was halfway down. \u201cLook at you,\u201d she said, and there was the love in it that makes a person able to be looked at. \u201cYou didn\u2019t combust. You didn\u2019t say bugger. You remembered to put your mouth where your heart is.\u201d\n\nOllie arrived with a bag of pears that he clearly hadn\u2019t meant to buy and the air of a man who is ready to be disappointed if it will make a better story. He peered at me as if looking for scorch marks. \u201cHow famous are you?\u201d he asked, without preamble. \u201cOn a scale from person who gets recognised at the dump to person who cannot buy toilet roll without a minor incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am recognised by toddlers who fear I am about to be a bedtime story,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd by men in fleeces who want to tell me about their blackbirds.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d he said. \u201cContainable fame. The best kind. We run a night on Thursday and call it \u2018The Man Off The Telly Reads And Then Everybody Goes Home Before Ten.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe was joking, but the idea lodged in the sort of corner that collects useful fluff. The thought of reading above the bicycle shop where the stair threatens to remove your dignity every time you climb it felt like a cure for an infection I hadn\u2019t admitted I\u2019d caught. The studio had been a machine and a miracle; the bicycle shop would be splinters and condensation and the way people make space with their attention rather than with lights. I told him I would, if he promised to temper the poster, and he promised to do something that included only my initials and a very confused pigeon.\n\nOn Tuesday morning the emails arrived like weather. Clemency orchestrated them with the relish of a conductor discovering that the orchestra is larger than she thought. There were invites and offers and a press request that made me snort tea through my nose. A radio programme wanted me to talk about the craft of timing and whether sadness has a rhythm. A festival wanted a curated evening entitled Ordinary Things That Saved Us, which made me itch because salvation is a word that belongs to people who use it with care. A small publisher I love sent a message that read, simply, If there\u2019s a pamphlet in it, we will find the staples and the patience. There was a letter forwarded from the show addressed to \u201cThe Gentleman Poet,\u201d in the spindly blue biro of prison paper, which I left unopened on the table while I caught up with my breath, and then opened with that breath in my throat. It was from a man in Parc who wrote about how the sound of the swifts had made the undersides of his ribs feel like windows, and who asked if I might write him a list of small tasks to do with his hands that would not get him into trouble. I wrote back that afternoon and told him about peeling oranges with attention and counting the screws in a hinge and learning the names of the weeds nobody loves.\n\nIn the middle of the admin, a text arrived without the weighty trailer of any app. It was from a number I now no longer had to memorise to know what my stomach would do when I saw it. Nice line about the cupboard. E. There was no flourish, no baroque vocabulary. The message looked almost embarrassed to be itself. I stared at it long enough for the screen to dim and then brightened the screen with my thumb as if encouraging a shy animal. I wrote back: That orange poem was good work. R. It was not what I had to say, and it might be what it had to be for now.\n\nAfter lunch, after telling my mother twice that no, I was not being asked to be a judge on anything and no, I could not arrange for Linda\u2019s cat to be on the Christmas special, I took the old fountain pen out of its drawer. The watch sat there too, its face bleached a little by years of not being asked to help. I picked it up the way you pick up a friendship you have neglected, careful not to pretend you haven\u2019t. My thumb found the knurled crown and I wound it until I felt the resistance change from welcome to warning. The tick it made in my palm was the least theatrical sound I had heard all day and I wanted to cry for the way we pretend small ticks are not how we stay alive. I set it down on the desk where my laptop had been sulking and let them glare at each other like rivals in a nursery.\n\nIn the evening I walked down to the river. The swifts were showing off, because of course they were, because every lesson in the world comes with an encore if you look up. The cathedral had decided not to sulk and was busy being a place where people make promises in party clothes. Tourists leaned on the parapet and let the wind edit their hair. A boy with a skateboard practised a thing I do not know the name of and failed and failed and then landed it and allowed himself one soundless celebration, like a prayer. I stood there and did the very unfashionable act of being grateful without an audience. If a television studio is a forge, the river is a sink, and sometimes you have to stand over it and wash your hands properly.\n\nThursday came and with it the open mic and a queue that made the bicycle shop look like it had become briefly famous in a French film. People had seen the poster with my initials and the pigeon and had made the correct assumptions. Ollie had put a string of fairy lights around the mic stand which made it look like an apology. The room smelled of chain oil and malty bread and the sort of nerves that improve a thing. I went up the stairs like a man proving he still could. Imogen stood behind the bar with the seriousness of a priest serving sacrament and told people it would be over by ten because some of us have to get up and bake at five. When I stood up and the chairs creaked and the room made that little collective surrender that rooms make when they have decided to trust you, I felt, briefly and completely, at home.\n\nI didn\u2019t read the television piece. I read the second version I\u2019d put back in the folder, the one I hadn\u2019t needed on the night and had loved quietly anyway. It was about the taste of the air on the first day of school and the way new exercise books pretend they will save you. It was about the vocabulary of small repairs and the feeling of being forgiven in a hardware shop. It was about the smell of my father\u2019s jumper, which I still keep in a bag that once had apples in it, and about a woman on the train who broke a KitKat into four exactly equal fingers and passed the fourth to a stranger because it seemed like the law. People laughed in the places where I had left them room to and quieted so completely at the end that I could hear somebody\u2019s coat recollecting the rain. There was no judge, no red light, no build, no camera. There was a man in a bicycle helmet who took it off like a hat. There was a girl at the back who had been chewing her sleeve and who, when I was done, put her sleeve back into her mouth like a person who has remembered herself.\n\nAfter, a woman came up and told me she\u2019d brought her father because he didn\u2019t like poems but he did like handrails and she thought I might be a bridge. A boy with hair like nettles handed me a zine he\u2019d stapled on a bus and said that the line about forgiving yourself had made his throat feel like it had swallowed a lightbulb and he wasn\u2019t sure if that was good or not. Ollie pressed a bottle of beer into my hand and told me briskly not to get used to applause indoors because we don\u2019t have room for it and people need to get back to their bikes. I walked home the long way, along the perimeter of the park where people throw balls to dogs that have learned generosity as a sport, and when I got in I wound the watch again and it ticked at me as if to say: yes, again, yes.\n\nThe next week became a rhythm that, for once, did not make me feel like I was being dragged. Mornings at the desk with the river doing its unshowy work. A radio interview done under a duvet because the room was echoey and I wanted the nation to hear only my vowels and not my ceiling. Emails from people who had seen me on the television and now wanted to see me in rooms with walls, which is a better way to see another person. A letter from the prison that had the neat lines of a man learning patience in pen. Coffee with a woman from the small publisher who wore a brooch shaped like a question mark and said, over a plate of biscuits whose ambition outstripped their butter, that perhaps I had a pamphlet, and perhaps it should be called Kindness Will Not Save Us But We Could Try Being Kind Anyway, and I grinned so wide the caf\u00e9 felt obliged to grant us a table with better light.\n\nEliot phoned on a Thursday when the bin lorry had already done its music. He asked me, in a voice that made him sound like he had slept and not slept, if I wanted to do an event in London in a fortnight. The pitch was a conversation rather than a cage match; the venue was an old cinema with seats that had held very many hearts through very many films. \u201cWe could be grown-ups,\u201d he said, and it was both a promise and a dare. I thought of the wire between us and how it had been, suddenly, less taut. I thought of the part of me that is a medieval peasant and looks for omens in the tea leaves and the part of me that is a man who has learned to wind a watch and let it tick. I told him to send me the details and that I would ask Clemency to look at the contract so we would not accidentally sell our pasts to a drinks brand. He laughed, relieved, as if the negotiation were a language he was glad we shared, and when we hung up I stood at the window and watched a woman teach a toddler to kick a ball and wished all our lessons were conducted with that kind of weather.\n\nOn the day the pamphlet was agreed in principle, I went to the charity shop with the haunted sequinned dress and found, tucked into a pile of things that had once been vital to someone, a jacket that looked like the cousin of the one Clemency had made me wear. It had elbow patches and a smell that said its previous owner had not been unkind. I paid three pounds and the woman at the till told me that I was the man from the television and that her husband had held her hand through my piece without even looking, which was the politest thing he had done in a month. I wore the jacket out and went to the Cathedral Green and sat on the grass and wrote the first paragraph of something I did not yet have a name for, and thought: this is what it is to begin, again, and again.\n\nAt home, the post had one of those brown envelopes that make even the innocent feel guilty. It was from the show, a royalties statement that looked like a list of everything I didn\u2019t know about the world. Tucked inside was a printed photograph, glossy in that way that makes fingers leave proof of themselves, of me on the stage at the moment my mouth was closed and the light had not yet decided. Someone had written on the back, in a hand I did not recognise but trusted immediately, Thank you for making the small things large. Don\u2019t tell my boss, I cried during a light-check. I put it on the fridge next to the picture of my shoulder relaxed because it seemed right that my shoulder should have company.\n\nA week later, at the event in the old cinema, Eliot and I learned how to be near each other without taking something that was not offered. The chairs were misbehaving and the microphones had a static crackle like old stars confessing, and the audience were the kind of people who have learned to clap without being told when to. We spoke about the difference between performance and hospitality and how sometimes the worst thing you can do to a feeling is put a bow on it. He said something generous about the way my work invites people to be better to themselves, and I said something true about the way his refuses to let anyone, including him, keep their comfortable lies. There were laughs and there were sighs and there were a few weaponised questions from the floor which we parried not with swords but with small domestic tools. In the bar after, he stood with his back to a poster for an old war film and told me that when he was nineteen he had wanted to be applauded for his cruelty and now he wanted to be applauded for his mercy and he was finding the second applause harder to earn. I told him mercy is harder to perform without props. We were quiet for a moment like men waiting for a kettle to click, and then he asked if I liked fennel yet and I told him I was trying.\n\nOn the train back that night, the carriage was full of people who had been to a different event involving sweat and lights and who were carrying their glitter home on their shoulders like a harmless contagion. I took the fountain pen out and wrote a list of the next small things I could do that would add up to a life: buy stamps; write back to the man in Parc; go to the allotments with tea in a flask and ask the man with the runner beans if he needed a hand; take my mother to the sea and let her point at boats and invent their biographies. At Tiverton Parkway, a man got on with a bag full of mushrooms and the certainty of his own intentions. The night outside the window was black and full and asked nothing of me but to arrive while it existed.\n\nWhen I stepped through my own front door, the flat patted itself to show me everything was where I had left it. The plant I had not killed drew its leaves in like a person shivering dramatically for effect. The watch on the desk ticked with the kind of optimism that pretends to be ordinary. I put the new jacket on the back of the chair and the old jacket in the wardrobe and the photograph on the fridge under a magnet shaped like a sardine. Before bed, I set the alarm and then set the alarm inside my head, the one that says: when the mist is on the river, go and look. I slept and dreamt about a cupboard full of mugs none of which matched and all of which insisted on being exactly themselves, and in the morning the bells did not sulk at all. They sang like they had always known we were listening.",

Exeter changed gear without checking its mirrors and suddenly we were halfway to July and the evenings pretended they had no curfew. I woke to the sound of gulls who had discovered a new way to disagree about bread, and the cathedral, moody as a teenager asked to empty the dishwasher, decided she might forgive us today. There is a particular blue the river keeps for mornings when you needed to be told you can start again; it\u2019s the colour of metal left out in kindness. I made tea and, because I have decided to behave like a person who owns his own life, I did not look at my phone until after the kettle had spoken twice.\n\nClemency sent a schedule in which my name looked like it had got on the wrong train. There was a daytime radio slot that would require my best vowels at an hour when my face still believes in darkness, and a meeting at the small publisher with the brooch in the shape of a question mark. She\u2019d typed, with the smug affection of a woman who has shepherded worse beasts than me, that she had said no to two brand \u201copportunities,\u201d one involving an insurance company\u2019s campaign about braver home contents and one involving a cereal bar. \u201cIf you need more fibre,\u201d she added, \u201cwe can attend to that without money changing hands.\u201d I sent her a photograph of my porridge as tribute and she replied with a thumbnail of her shoes, which is her way of reminding me she is very good at walking briskly towards my better interests.\n\nOn Wednesday the school wrote, the one where I had sat through assemblies about road safety that made death sound both efficient and moral. The email came via a woman called Dawn with decades of competence in her sentences and an attachment called \u201cSpeechDayRunningOrderFINALFINAL2.docx.\u201d They were short of someone who could tell a roomful of teenagers that life had a shape without lying to them. Would I speak for seven minutes about writing and not giving up and, possibly, resilience, but only if I actually meant it. I read the word \u201cresilience\u201d and pictured a shop selling \u201cResilience!\u201d in small boxes next to the till. I wrote back that I would say what I could say without causing anyone to doze upright. Dawn replied within ten minutes with three exclamation marks and a line about biscuits. I put the date in my calendar and touched wood and my pocket and the top of the doorframe on my way out of the kitchen because superstition is, for me, a form of stretching.\n\nThe publisher\u2019s office was the sort of small room in which it is possible to believe you could make a book with your hands. There were boxes that looked heavy in a way that makes you want to be useful, and a potted plant that was thriving out of sheer bloody-mindedness. The woman with the brooch, whose name I really ought to have asked the first time and now could not, debriefed me over a biscuit that flaked like a veteran. \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d she said, which is a sentence that sets off the sprinklers in my head. \u201cThe pamphlet. A dozen pieces. Yours aren\u2019t quite poems and they\u2019re not quite essays and we\u2019re not sorry about that. A small thing that fits a coat pocket and can be given to a person on a bench. We\u2019ve mocked up covers.\u201d She laid out three options like shirts before a wedding. One was a blue that felt slightly dishonest. One was a green that would take a bad photograph. One was exactly the colour of the river when it had decided to help. The title was our argument. \u201cNot What You Win\u201d had the plainness I admire and fear. \u201cThe Good Mugs\u201d made me sentimental in a way the internet would punish me for. \u201cKindness Will Not Save Us\u201d had the right fight but the wrong rhythm. In the end we did that British thing where we didn\u2019t decide, and instead we made tea and agreed to live with our indecision for a week in the hope it would resolve itself overnight.\n\nI walked from the office to the station because London reminds you that your body was designed to move in places where taxis can\u2019t. On the train, a man slept with his mouth open and the confidence of someone who has never woken up on television with his own face on a nearby screen. Opposite me a girl annotated a textbook with the hand of a person teaching herself to forgive her sentences. The clouds over Woking organised themselves politely into ranks. I wrote half a paragraph about the way stations pretend to be beginnings when they are mostly middles. The woman who checked our tickets asked for mine like she was asking my name for the second time at a party and we both decided to pretend we remembered.\n\nAt the radio station they led me into a room that was both a cupboard and a spaceship. The producer was thirty and had the deep calm of a person who routinely shepherds panic into sound. He told me that we were going to talk about the rhythm of sadness and how to time a laugh so it works on the radio and then, without moving any of his muscles, asked me if I had ever been so angry I had bitten something that wasn\u2019t food. We talked for twelve minutes about fathers without saying the word \u201cgrief\u201d once and then, after the red light had politely put itself to bed, he asked me to sign a staff mug. \u201cWe break them on Thursday afternoons,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt looks unprofessional if it\u2019s one of the expensive ones.\u201d I wrote, \u201cDo not put this in the dishwasher,\u201d and then stood with the pen above the ceramic for a heartbeat and added, \u201cBe kind to the person who washes it.\u201d\n\nAfterwards, I sat on a bench in Embankment Gardens and watched a pigeon perform despair with a level of commitment that made it not only believable but briefly fashionable. A woman in running kit did the sort of stretching that makes strangers feel tired, and a man in a suit that had known better days ate a ham sandwich with the gravity of a priest. I phoned my mother and told her the radio had gone well and yes, of course she could listen back on the internet and no, she didn\u2019t need to call Linda because Linda had already left a voicemail asking if I could get her Mixtape Man from the weekend following the one we were talking about to do a shout-out for her cat. \u201cYou sound thin,\u201d my mother said, which is her way of asking if I am eating. I told her about the biscuits and she was satisfied in the way only carbohydrates can satisfy someone\u2019s mother at two in the afternoon.\n\nBack in Exeter that evening the river pretended it had been waiting for me specifically, which is the sort of lie I am happy to be told. Imogen had chalk dust on her nose and contempt for someone who had asked for iced coffee as if Britain had always been a place that did that. I sat in the window and tried on possible lives in the reflection. In one of them I lived in London again, wore a better jacket, ran for trains with resentment, pretended it didn\u2019t matter who was in the room. In one of them I moved to a village with a pub that gave you change in coins that felt like old prayers, and I wrote in a wooden chair that had injured men for a century, and I sometimes forgot to be terrified. In the actual life I drank coffee that had been made by someone who refuses to spell my name correctly on principle, and I cut a paragraph that tried too hard, and I put the paragraph on a small pile called \u201cKeep for later,\u201d which is mostly a compost heap with delusions of grandeur.\n\nThe letter from Parc turned into a parcel. It arrived on a Thursday afternoon smelling of permanent marker and patience. Inside there were pages in the careful hand of a man not writing to impress anyone, a list of the small tasks he had set himself: peel an orange in one motion, count the steps from cell to chapel without making it look like you are counting, learn the names of the birds that will come if you put crumbs on the windowsill and pretend you didn\u2019t mean it. There was a drawing of a mug with \u201cGOOD\u201d written on it, done in biro with a dedication to a man who had never been allowed to choose a mug in his life. There was permission from the governor and a timetable with my name in a column called \u201cVISITING EDUCATORS\u201d that made me feel briefly like a person with a backpack full of felt tips and a purpose. \u201cIf you will,\u201d he had written in the space under \u201cActivities\u201d, \u201ctell the men that even if there is nothing to be done, there are things to do.\u201d I emailed Clemency and she said that she would navigate the forms and that I should buy a belt that would not set off the scanner and that she would remind me, gently but relentlessly, that a workshop is a workshop and not an attempt to un-make the world.\n\nSpeech Day came dressed in bunting and rain that couldn\u2019t commit. The hall was how I remembered it and also smaller, because time is rude. The headteacher had the polished kindness of a man who has broken up fights by remembering boys\u2019 names. A child in a blazer sat at the piano and played something that was trying to be Beethoven and landed instead in the soft field of \u201cvery nearly.\u201d I sat on a plastic chair that had not forgiven anyone who had ever been late. When it was my turn, the microphone was both too close and too far and the floor was waxed in a way that made menace elegant. I looked at the faces of thirteen-year-olds who have learned already to hide their catastrophes and the faces of seventeen-year-olds who think they have invented every feeling. I told them I had scribbled my name on the underside of this very chair with a compass because I was bored and then spent the next year petrified my handwriting would give me away. I asked them, because I can\u2019t help myself, what was the strangest thing they had ever believed about themselves, and I held the silence at the end of the question like a bowl for their answers. A girl in the third row said she had believed for a whole year that she was bad at reading because she read quickly, and a boy in a tie he had not tied himself said he had believed he was supposed to be the one who was always fine and now he wasn\u2019t sure what the question even meant. Somewhere near the back, a boy with the eyes of a creature that knows which bushes the foxes favour looked at me and then looked away as if I had looked at him in a language he had not yet learned to understand. I told them that when I was thirteen I thought being ordinary was the worst thing, and that at thirty-seven I considered it the rescue boat. A few teachers laughed in the guilty way adults laugh when they recognise themselves. The headteacher shook my hand afterwards and thanked me for being ordinary on purpose in front of his pupils and offered me one of those biscuits that taste of fundraising and starch.\n\nIn my mother\u2019s kitchen that afternoon the smell was of onion and decision. She had written \u201cSPAG BOL\u201d on a piece of paper as if it were a spell that needed stroking into being. The radio told us about a by-election in a voice that refused to admit it hoped for chaos, and she told me that Aunt Joy had found a dance class for women with opinions and was coming home flushed twice a week with the joy of someone who had been allowed to sweat. I asked her if she still had Dad\u2019s jumper, and she got up without asking me why and went to the cupboard where she keeps the things she pretends she doesn\u2019t keep, and brought out the bag that once had apples in it. The jumper smelled like the ghost of a summer shed. She watched me smell it with the benign cruelty of a person who has been practicing not crying for longer than I\u2019ve been alive. \u201cHe wrote things down,\u201d she said, stirring the sauce with a wooden spoon that had never learned another job. \u201cNot just lists. Bits and bobs. You know that.\u201d I nodded. \u201cHe wrote bird names wrong on purpose,\u201d she added, as if confessing to petty theft, \u201cso you would correct him and you would learn them without feeling like someone was putting facts in you. He said it made you fierce in a way he liked. He kept them all.\u201d She went to the dresser and brought me a notebook with a fat elastic band in the middle and his careful untidy handwriting at the top of the first page: \u201cBlakbird, Robin, Tosspot Tit.\u201d I laughed with my whole face and then in the crease of the laugh there was the ache, and that was alright. We ate spaghetti and she told me, guarded and open, how he had once nearly auditioned for the village pantomime as a cow and had backed out because he did not want to look like the man who always said yes, and how he had regretted it and then made the allotment the place where he said yes to everything else.\n\nThe workshop at Parc required shoes you couldn\u2019t run in and a willingness to hand over your essentials to a locker that smelled, faintly, of older versions of hope. The security guards were both bored and heroic, and the metal detector was a child performing attention. The officer who escorted me through had a voice that would have served him well in church and a wrist tattoo that did not. In the classroom the tables were laid out in a horseshoe, which is a shape that makes adults behave better. The men came in with their shoulders already braced for embarrassment and their eyes already occupied elsewhere. The man who had written to me sat down and tapped the table twice with his nail because his hands needed work. I told them we would be writing lists and that I would not be confiscating any of them, and the man at the back with the beautifully ridiculous ears said thank Christ, which I chose to interpret as enthusiasm. We did the work of making it safe to say something without pretending it was safe here. They wrote \u201cTen small mercies you can make with your hands\u201d and \u201cFive facts you didn\u2019t know were true until you told them to someone else.\u201d One of them wrote that he was good at polishing shoes to the point where they resembled their own dreams of themselves and that when he got out he wanted to be paid for making other people feel ready to meet their days. One of them wrote that he knew how to fold sheets with military corners and that it might be the only useful thing he had learned in a place designed to teach you all the wrong lessons. They asked me about the television and I told them it was a machine that kept working whether you wanted it to or not, and that the only part of it that had felt like home was the part where I said what I had to say. At the end, the man who had written me the mug drew me a watch in biro, complete with a tiny second hand moving nowhere in particular, and labelled it \u201cto be wound.\u201d\n\nIt was on the way back from Parc that Eliot phoned, and the Welsh hills executed their performance of looking like a late apology. \u201cAre you at a service station?\u201d he said, and he said it with such elegant disdain for service stations that I had to pull over just to give the moment the attention it deserved. He was in a taxi that was taking too long and he wanted to complain artistically. \u201cI did the thing last night,\u201d he said, not naming which thing because there is only ever one thing and it\u2019s always the most. \u201cI said a line and I thought of you saying the other line and I wondered if we were writing into each other\u2019s blanks.\u201d There was a horn and a sigh. \u201cCan I come down,\u201d he asked without being the kind of person who asks, \u201cand read with you above the bicycle shop and then be humbled by your scones?\u201d I told him that the scones were not mine to deploy but that I would speak to the appropriate authorities. When I told Ollie he made a noise like a kettle that has decided not to boil and then he made a poster with only initials and a picture of a bicycle whose wheels were made of punctuation. \u201cNobody needs this,\u201d he said, cheerfully lying, \u201cand therefore it will be good.\u201d\n\nWe took my mother to the sea on a Saturday that had remembered what Saturdays are for. Dawlish was in the mood to please, throwing a train along the edge of itself like a trick it never gets bored of. We bought chips so hot they made us walk like injured birds. A gull the size of a possible sin hovered above my mother\u2019s head with the entitlement of a landlord, and she waved it away with the hand of a woman who has taught bigger creatures their manners. She told me, because she always gets around to saying the thing she has come to say, that she had found a letter in the shed, addressed to \u201cR + M\u201d in my father\u2019s unsteady pretence at a copperplate. Inside was a list of the things he could do if he had to leave earlier than he wanted. \u201cPut the watch in the drawer for a while,\u201d it said, \u201cand don\u2019t you dare throw out the fork. The beans need it. Rowan will say he hates performance and then he\u2019ll get on a stage because he can\u2019t stop himself telling the kitchen stories to strangers. Let him. He\u2019ll come home.\u201d My mother had underlined \u201cHe\u2019ll come home\u201d in two colours, because her extravagance is usually for other people, and she rolled her eyes at the idea of being predicted and then she cried with her mouth in that tidy way she has and let me see it. We sat on the sea wall and I could feel the day going to sleep under my hands, and it was the sort of tired that tells you you\u2019ve earned it.\n\nThe reading with Eliot above the bicycle shop made the stair perform its party piece twice. People came because they had been told to be reasonable for too long and this did not look reasonable. The room was too warm and too thankful. Eliot wore black because he has never learned that Exeter does not care, and he looked at the fairy lights like a man being introduced to earnestness for the first time at a cousin\u2019s wedding. We took turns and then we took risks and then we took questions from a corner where someone had brought a baby who gurgled when we said the word \u201ckind.\u201d He read the orange again and let it have more juice this time, and I read something about the hardware shop where the man behind the counter always says, \u201cWe can sort you out,\u201d as if that were a vow and not a sales technique. When the questions bent themselves into weapons, we set them down gently and asked the askers if they were alright. Afterward, he stood on the pavement and tried to light a cigarette in a wind that knew better, and I stood next to him with a bag of Imogen\u2019s scones and we performed d\u00e9tente with crumbs. He said, and I could feel the sentence rough its way over his teeth, that he had been shown a picture of himself at nineteen and had not found it useful, and that perhaps he needed a picture of himself at forty with his mouth closed. I told him that mouths are difficult, and he laughed with relief like a man putting down a small heavy box. He asked to see the river like a tourist and I took him to it like a local, and we leaned and did the man thing of pretending to be thinking about boats when we were really thinking about not drowning.\n\nThe day the pamphlet\u2019s title decided itself, it did it while I was not in the room. I came home to an email from the question-mark brooch that said, \u201cWe\u2019re all pretending this was your idea. \u2018Not What You Win.\u2019 Font attached. There will be an argument about staples on Tuesday.\u201d The cover was the river colour and the paper had that roughness that makes a reader feel they are permitted to touch. I held the PDF up to the light as if it might develop like a photograph. The list of contents made me feel both organised and exposed. I wrote back my agreed-upon yes and then walked to the allotments with a flask because there is no celebration like watching someone water beans. The man with the runner beans was there, shoulders curved to the job like a blessing, and I handed him tea and he handed me string, and we built a frame that could teach you as much about performance as any stage. Tension and give, resistance and the refusal to snap, the memory a knot keeps of the hands that tied it. He told me, in the unpunctuated way people talk when they are doing something they understand, about his grandsons and the tomatoes they grew on a windowsill and how the window sill had got into the tomatoes. I listened, which is to say I let him not ask a question and still expect an answer. When I left he said, \u201cMind how you go,\u201d and it felt like a benediction rather than an instruction.\n\nIn August the swifts left in the middle of a sentence and the river lost its gossip. School uniforms appeared in shop windows like an apology. The bicycle shop put up a sign about repairing punctures and broken hearts and Ollie pretended he hadn\u2019t done it and then took the credit when asked. The pamphlet proofs arrived in a cardboard envelope that sounded important when opened. I sat at the table with a pencil and did the religious work of making small black marks on a future. I changed \u201cand\u201d to \u201cbut\u201d and then back again as if the conjunction were a life choice. I called my mother to ask if she wanted the dedication or if that would create more trouble than it solved, and she said that she wanted to be on the acknowledgements in small print because she is not a show-off, but that if I put Aunt Joy on the acknowledgements I had to let her choose her own comma. I wrote, \u201cFor M., for R., for the cupboard with the good mugs,\u201d and I stopped while I was still being honest.\n\nAt the launch, which was a jug of wine, a jug of water and a table that had seen more ambitious nights, people queued to have me write their names on paper like it meant anything. A woman who had seen me on the television and then avoided her sadness for two months and then failed to avoid it the following Tuesday asked me to write, \u201cYou are not what you win,\u201d and I did, and she pressed the book to her stomach like a baby and I did not show off by being clever. The man from Parc\u2019s wife came without telling me she would and held my hand for long enough that the part of me that hates being held had to shut up. Eliot sent flowers wrapped in brown paper that made them look earnest, and a card that said, \u201cThis is not a concession,\u201d which is his romance. Imogen refused to let me pay for the traybakes and Ollie did a speech that pretended to be a joke and was, in truth, a stitch in something that might hold.\n\nAfter the people, after the photographs in which my shoulder is again, miraculously, relaxed, after the tinny clink of glasses that revealed themselves to be plastic, I walked home through a city that had finally let its hair down. I passed the charity shop window where the sequinned dress had given up its mystery to a woman who was taking it somewhere it deserved. I passed the second-hand bookshop that smelled of ambitions that had been well loved. At the bridge I leaned the way men have always leaned and I wound the watch in my pocket because some habits are more honest than prayer. The bells did not sulk. The swifts were gone and the sky had put the kettle on for the long boil of autumn. The pamphlet lay in my bag, the good mugs waited in their cupboard, Exeter kept its gossip to itself, and I went upstairs to the flat that had forgiven me, and I slept under the comfortable weight of a day that had not tried to turn itself into a headline.",

                              "content": "Chapter Seven\n\nBy September the swifts had packed their tiny bags and left without forwarding addresses, and the river went back to telling slower stories. The city began that annual rehearsal for weather, finding scarves at the backs of drawers like old loyalties and pretending we had always known how to stand still and be rained on with dignity. I woke one morning to a sky the colour of kitchen foil and the sound of the council\u2019s leaf blower insisting autumn was a structural fault that could be remedied by enthusiasm. The watch on my desk ticked with the equanimity of a small god. I had not learned to be equanimous, but I had learned to wind.\n\nThe pamphlet did what small books do when they are allowed to leave the house. It went into the world in coat pockets and handbags and once, according to a photograph sent by a woman called Shauna from Paisley, into the hollow of a radiator where it sat for two days like a guilty child until the central heating admitted defeat and gave it back. People wrote to say they had read it on a lunch break and then gone back to their desks with their shoulders lowered by one stubborn inch. A man in Leeds posted it to his brother in Ballinasloe with a note that said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to like poems,\u201d and then wrote to me in a panic to ask if it was, in fact, a poem, because he feared he had lied. A woman in Birmingham asked if I would sign three copies to \u201cSaira, who has fought and won, Kay, who is still fighting, and Mum, who says she never fought anyone but lies beautifully.\u201d The small publisher sent me an email with the subject line \u201cReprint?\u201d and the question mark did a small dance in my stomach I tried to ignore and then welcomed like a proper guest.\n\nIt turns out if you say \u201cnot what you win\u201d out loud in public enough times, people assume you are the sort of person who is immune to prizes and the weather. I am not immune to either. The first time a list appeared with my name on it I felt the old wire tighten in the room, the one that attaches me to the version of myself who believes affection is a ration and whoever gets the largest tin has eaten yours. The list was for a prize with a name that sounds like a piece of furniture, and the email came from a literary administrator who has never left a kettle unattended in her life. Clemency phoned before I could forward it to her and said, warmly but strictly, that I was to say \u201cthank you\u201d in three places and not be caught in a photograph trying to disappear into my own jacket. \u201cThis is not a night for humility you wear like borrowed shoes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will eat the canap\u00e9s instead of taking them for a walk. Also, wear the river-colour tie.\u201d\n\nI wore the tie because it looked like somebody had bottled a good day. The event was in a room that had hosted enough ceremonies to believe itself a church, which is to say there were chairs and opinions. Eliot was there with his coat the colour of a decision and a smile that revealed nothing about the rest of him. He waved like a diplomat from a friendly but distant country. The man from the big paper asked if he could write a profile and the woman from the radio promised me three minutes on a Friday if I could make grief witty. I smiled in a way my face recognised as survival and watched several conversations in which I starred glide past like swans that would not let me feed them. The winner was someone I liked in print and in person, which is a relief and also a fresh challenge for my pettier self. On the train home I balanced the certificate on my knees and texted my mother a photograph; she wrote back, This is the nice paper, and attached a small string of party hat emojis that looked like a regiment of festive carrots.\n\nIt was after that night that the paper ran their profile anyway, as papers will, with a picture of me looking like I\u2019d been told to imagine a joke about someone else. The headline contained the word \u201creluctant,\u201d which is the lazy shorthand people use when a person\u2019s face refuses to arrange itself into uninterrupted ambition. The journalist had been to Exeter and asked me about the river and my father and the cupboard with the good mugs, and I had answered in the only way I know, which is to tell the truth and then tidy it as if it were late for something. When the piece appeared, the quotes were accurate and the adjectives were not, and it included a paragraph about how I \u201chad not married my work\u201d that made me sound like a man who had jilted a profession at the altar and fled to Devon with grief on the back of a moped. Imogen read it with the expression she reserves for weather forecasts and break-up songs, rolled her eyes so thoroughly she nearly saw her own thought processes, and drew a moustache on my newsprint face with legitimate skill. \u201cYou look better,\u201d she said, handing it back, and then put it under the grinder to stop it from floating around my head like a wasp.\n\nMeanwhile my mother decided the shed had had long enough to sulk and needed to be helped into its next life. The allotment committee, who are a body composed of men with twine and verdicts, had offered me my father\u2019s plot on condition that I sign a form promising never to grow more than a patriotic proportion of courgettes. \u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d my mother said in the voice she used when I was six and had hidden my school shoes under my bed in protest at the concept of walking as a public act. We went down on a Saturday that had decided to be generous and found the fork where it had always leant, a vertical memorial that did not make a fuss. The shed smelled like my father\u2019s pockets, which is to say, a small kingdom of twine and pencils and the tobacco he didn\u2019t smoke anymore except in habits. We emptied boxes that had kept themselves busy by shifting their contents from one corner to another when left alone. There were seed packets that had decided to retire and a tin of screws that looked exactly like a tin of screws and a jam jar full of coins from three currencies and a decade. There were notebooks with my father\u2019s handwriting practising its untidiness and a page headed \u201cThings to Mend,\u201d under which he had written \u201cFence, gate, attitude (Rowan\u2019s), patience (mine).\u201d\n\nUnder a stack of plant pots we found a shoe box with three cassettes in it, labelled in that careful not-careful hand: \u201cBirds 1998\u201d, \u201cTo M\u201d, and \u201cR\u2014Don\u2019t be cross.\u201d My mother took the one with her letter and put it in her pocket as if it had heat, and I took mine and did not put it near my heart because I am sentimental about too many other things as it is. We no longer own a device for the purpose, because time is impolite, but Linda from down the road does, because Linda has never met a gadget she didn\u2019t store for later. She set it up on her kitchen table between a fruit bowl the shape of regret and a small army of porcelain hedgehogs, and we pressed play knowing we had not prepared enough for the sound of a man we loved arriving in the room. At first there was only tape hiss, the radio static of the past making itself at home, and then my father cleared his throat in that way he used to, as if giving the air a chance to behave.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, and then laughed at himself for saying right to nobody. \u201cRowan. If you\u2019re listening to this, first of all, your mother hasn\u2019t thrown out my old tape recorder, which is a victory for my side. Second of all, I am about to say some things I am not clever enough to write down because then I\u2019ll fiddle with the words instead of telling you what I mean.\u201d He proceeded to misname birds for seven minutes in a row with such deliberate wrongness I laughed and then had to put my hand over my mouth because of the sound trying to get out. \u201cBlakbird. Robbin. Angry Poet Tit.\u201d Between jokes, he fitted in the sentences I had wanted and the ones I had not known I wanted. He told me to be common as muck in my kindness and fancy as I liked in my sentences. He told me to wind the watch when I needed the day to have a spine. He told me that if I ever felt like I was losing, to check whether I had started counting the wrong things. When the tape clicked off Linda and my mother and I sat there as if we had been told not to move during a wasp, and Linda broke the spell by putting a plate of biscuits in front of us because she is a magician who uses sugar as her wand.\n\nI took the allotment because it would have been rude not to. The first time I put the fork into the earth and leaned, I remembered the choreography of it in my bones like a song I hadn\u2019t liked at the time and now found myself humming. The soil gave up its stones with that reluctant generosity dirt displays when it likes you. The man with the runner beans watched me from his side of the thin wire civilization and nodded as if to say I had not ruined anything yet. He came over with string and a suggestion about wind and we built another frame, this time with ghost hands helping. In the afternoons I would take my pages down there and read a paragraph to the path between the beds, because I have decided there is no point in pretending not to be the man who talks to dirt. When I looked up, there were always the gulls doing philosophy at the sky and the small children doing philosophy at the puddles, and somehow the arguments overlapped.\n\nThe prison wrote to ask if I could come back and bring, if possible, more lists. The men had found the business of naming mercies a tolerable way to spend a Tuesday, and one of them had started a thing he called \u201cThe Cupboard,\u201d which was a list on the wall in the education block of items to try when the day was behaving like a locked door. It included \u201clearn the names of the people who clean your cell and say them like they\u2019re worth knowing,\u201d and \u201cremember your favourite word, not the one you should like, the one you do,\u201d and \u201cwhat to do with an orange when there is no knife,\u201d which I suspect he wrote to make me laugh. The governor had given cautious permission for the small publisher to print fifty copies of a zine we were calling \u201cThe Good Mugs,\u201d and the brooch editor had cried on the phone for a bit, then cleared her throat, then asked me for names to put in the back under \u201cMade by,\u201d and I did my best to do no harm. On my second visit, the man with the ridiculous ears read aloud a list called \u201cReasons I Did Not Hit Him Back\u201d and it was so beautiful and so ferocious in its refusal to make a saint out of himself that the room stood up in the way rooms sometimes do when no one told them to.\n\nIt was after that workshop that Eliot came down on a weekday and tried to pretend he did not care about trains. He arrived at St David\u2019s in a coat that had not been tested for drizzle and a face that had recently done a fight with a mirror and called it grooming. He looked around as if cities are actors who can remember their lines if prompted. \u201cThis whole place,\u201d he said, \u201cfeels like a good sentence you\u2019ve taken an axe to in the right places.\u201d I took him to the caf\u00e9 where Imogen refused to be impressed on principle and then, when he said the words \u201csingle origin\u201d without performing a somersault, allowed him to exist. We walked by the river and he refused, out of stubbornness and fear of clich\u00e9, to say \u201cpretty,\u201d and we talked about work in the way men do when they are trying not to show underbellies. He confessed he had said no to a television thing that would have made him the man who says yes to all the things, and I told him I had said no to cereal bars, and we stood there being faintly heroic about not selling ourselves for oat flakes. It was only later he admitted it felt more like relief than courage.\n\nWe read again above the bicycle shop because Ollie announced we would and then had the terrible luck of being right. The poster this time was just a picture of the river and a pencil with a halo, and when Eliot saw it he said he had always suspected the West Country of being better at piety. The room was full of people who had decided they liked the sensation of concentrating together and a few who had come because they had resolved, in a valiant way, to start liking poetry by force. Eliot read a piece about shame that did the precise unkindness required to be merciful, and I read a list called \u201cInstructions for the Ordinary Day\u201d that included \u201cmake tea in a mug someone else would choose,\u201d and \u201ccall your mother and ask about one thing she could have been champion of,\u201d and \u201cfind a faintly ridiculous bird and applaud it.\u201d At the end an old man with hair like a memory came up and told us the story of when he had been nineteen and had all his money stolen by a woman he later married, and we listened for long enough that the listening turned into a kind of love.\n\nThe invitation to the school\u2019s winter fair arrived on a postcard with a snowman who looked like he\u2019d had to reapply for his job. Could I judge mince pies without hurting anyone and would I be willing to read something at the turning on of the lights that would not cause children to ask awkward questions about mortality. I said yes to the pies and maybe to the reading, and then spent an afternoon trying to write a sentence in which a fairy light has a crisis of faith and still gets turned on without anything tragic happening to it. On the day, I stood in a gym that smelled of wax and teenage bravery and tasted thirty-two pies and learned both the limits to human cinnamon tolerance and the thrill of being permitted to wield a score sheet. A child in a homemade elf hat asked me if I was the man who had been on the television and whether I could tell his dad that it is allowed to cry when you watch adverts; I told him that I could tell his dad and that his dad would agree but would phrase it in a way that made it sound like he had invented the concept.\n\nClemency arranged a small tour of bookshops that were really rooms with good lighting and excellent chairs. We did Bristol on a Tuesday to an audience that included a man who knows the difference between \u201caffect\u201d and \u201ceffect\u201d and will speak up about it if provoked, and we did Bath to a roomful of women who knit during questions and then produced more insight than anyone else in Britain. We did Truro to a man who had driven two hours to be told it was OK to love a thing from the late 90s sincerely. On the train between cities I wrote a piece about what to pack if you plan to be generous, and it included \u201ca pen that doesn\u2019t explode under pressure,\u201d and \u201ccoins,\u201d and \u201ca cardigan with pockets that can pretend to be a hug,\u201d and \u201ca story about your worst mistake told without self-deprecation,\u201d and I read it in Falmouth to a woman who came up afterwards and said she had been waiting thirty-seven years to be told to stop making her own pain charming.\n\nIn November the river pumped itself with a kind of purpose that felt like news. The allotment went to sleep with the severity of a child refusing to be convinced. I planted garlic because Eliot told me it made you feel like you were doing something about the future, and I put my hand to the ground and it felt like a chest still breathing. My mother began her annual campaign to pretend Christmas did not require planning while simultaneously planning Christmas with a military precision that would have impressed even the most annoying head of year. Aunt Joy took up tap, which none of us deserved but all of us enjoyed, and Linda\u2019s cat found a new way to look offended by tinsel. I wound the watch and let it tick through the early dark like an argument for patience.\n\nIt was around then that the email came from the school saying a boy in Year Ten had asked if I would look at his poem, and would I tell him, gently, whether it was good because otherwise he would measure himself by silence and that was not fair. His name was Isaac and he wrote like a person who had overheard a good conversation and knew he was supposed to lean in. He wrote, \u201cI am not the boy you think is fine, I am the boy who knows where the foxes go,\u201d and when I read it I put the piece of paper down and breathed like a sensible person, which in my case is a novelty. I wrote back that he had made something with a shape and a sound and that he should write twenty more, not because he had to prove anything to anyone, but because he had found something that made one minute pay attention to the next. He sent a second poem three days later called \u201cList of Quiet,\u201d and I put it on my fridge next to my own photograph because one of us had to be in good company.\n\nThe call from the London programme came as the river was trying to be a mirror and failing in an honorable way. They wanted a Christmas show full of \u201cheart\u201d and \u201clight,\u201d and the producer used the word \u201cuplift\u201d twice in one sentence and I watched my better self try not to stand up and walk out of my body. Clemency did our layers of honesty and determined there was room for me to do a thing that would not make me look like a man delivering parsnips to a nation from a sleigh. I wrote a piece called \u201cInstructions for Christmas,\u201d which included, \u201cfind somebody who hates it and make them a cheese toastie,\u201d and \u201cremember your dead by telling a good joke they would have laughed at,\u201d and \u201cdo not attempt to reform your entire personality by Boxing Day,\u201d and \u201cput one mug at the back of the cupboard and call it January.\u201d On the night, I wore the jacket with elbow patches that smelled like its previous owner chopped wood and sang and I did not say \u201cbugger,\u201d and the studio made that fond noise it makes when it is pretending it is your living room. After, a woman stopped me at the station and told me her brother had died in February and that she had laughed at the bit with the toastie and she thought he would have loved it because he always burned everything and smiled about it. I stood there like a man confronted by mercy in a queue and promised myself, again, I would count the right things.\n\nOn the last day of the year, I went to the allotment with a flask and a notebook and the sort of optimism that leaves the door open for realism to come back in later. The beds were tart with cold and the path pretended to be an ice rink you could skate on with your eyes. The fork leaned and the shed stood and the world agreed to be bigger than my little life by at least the correct margin. I wrote a list of ten ways to enter a year and I did not number them because some things are not ranking exercises. It said, \u201cwind the watch,\u201d and \u201cbring your own light but let other people hold it,\u201d and \u201cask the river what it knows and pretend to understand,\u201d and \u201crescue one ridiculous thing and let it rescue you back.\u201d On the way home I saw a boy practicing keepy-uppies against a wall with the air of a surgeon and a girl in an enormous coat teaching a dog how to take off a mitten gently, and I put both of them in my pocket for later.\n\nAt midnight the cathedral did not sulk at all. She sang herself inside out, and the city shouted responses in the language of pans banging and fireworks admitting defeat to clouds. I stood at my window with a mug that did not match any other mug and watched Exeter remember and forget itself in the exact right proportions. My phone sulked on the table and then behaved and then sulked, and I let it because we were both tired. I thought of the men at Parc, forty seconds into a new year they had to spend the same way they had spent the last one and the next one, and I promised myself a morning in January for \u201cThe Cupboard.\u201d I thought of Isaac, and the poem about foxes, and my father\u2019s voice misnaming birds on purpose, and my mother\u2019s face when she tasted a mince pie she had not made and declared it brave. I wound the watch, listened to the tick settle into the dark like a metronome for a heart, and went to bed in a flat that had decided to forgive me again tomorrow if I asked nicely and brought coffee.",

                              "content": "Chapter Eight\n\nJanuary arrived as if it had been waiting outside the door with its boots on, pretending not to mind the cold. The river gave up its gossip and dealt in facts; frost wrote its arguments along the bins with a thoroughness I respected. I woke to a morning so bright and pitiless it made even the cathedral look freshly washed, and I did the thing that has become my compromise with the day: kettle on, blinds open, watch wound. It is hard to overstate the comfort of a small machine choosing, politely and without grandeur, to behave again when asked. The first week the city looked like it had stopped breathing by accident and needed reminding, the way you put a hand to a sleeping dog to be sure. We remembered our scarves and the gulls remembered their right to be indignant, and the council trucks performed a ballet along the quay involving grit, hand signals and the kind of mutual trust I associate with marriages where nobody posts about it.\n\nI kept my promise to Parc the second Tuesday, the one the governor had offered me cautiously, as if kindness was a resource he was not quite prepared to believe could be replenished. I learned the system well enough to move through it without insulting it: belt off, watch in the tray, palms up, questions answered in the tone that tells a person you know they are not the one who designed the rules. The corridor smelled of floor polish and the tiredness of men who have learned to stand still. In the classroom the horseshoe of tables was waiting again like a tool that had made itself useful and resented it slightly. The men came in as men do when their names have been said too loudly for too long. This time I brought a list with me, which is to say I brought a way to bring them to the table without making them present their throats. \u201cThe Cupboard,\u201d I wrote on the whiteboard, and underneath it, in my careful teacher hand, because that is the role I can fill without lying: \u201cThings to do when there is nothing to be done.\u201d\n\nWe made it together, which is the only way I know to honour the fiction that we were not pretending at anything else. \u201cLearn the names of the rivets in the bunk,\u201d offered the man with the ridiculous ears, and the room did that laugh it does when it has decided liking you is easier than distrusting you. \u201cFold a T-shirt more slowly than pride would allow,\u201d said another, and a third contributed, in a voice two sizes too large for his sentence, \u201cWrite a postcard to the person you were nineteen, and forgive him for thinking he would never need to learn to cook rice.\u201d The man who had started this with his letter held the pen like a tool he had just discovered had more than one function and wrote, deliberately, \u201cBreathe into your hands until they stop being a weapon.\u201d I stood there with the marker and nodded like a priest and the room let itself be church. In the break, the officer with the wrist tattoo asked me if I knew the poem about the people in the boats and the mouth and I said I did and he told me, with the kind of careful resentment people keep for the things that have hurt them into beauty, that he had once cried by a fence. When I left, the list stayed behind on the wall, and I tried not to imagine it being taken down and put in a folder marked \u201cARTS,\u201d because imagining it there felt like a promise I wanted to keep.\n\nThe watch stopped on a Friday, exactly at midday, the hands lined up in a way that would have looked deliberate if I were a person inclined to read omens where there are only guts and gears. I put it to my ear and heard nothing and the quiet had weight. I do not need a watch in the way men used to; I live inside a machinery of notifications that will not allow me to die without an alarm. And yet the silence sent me into a small panic that felt exactly as serious as it needed to and no more. I asked around quietly, because Exeter is full of people who know exactly what you need if you ask in the tone that suggests you will not be a burden. A man with a stall on the market offered the name of a watchmaker in Topsham who, according to him, had fixed a clock that had decided to stop every year on the date a woman\u2019s husband had died. \u201cShe made it behave kindly,\u201d he said, with the reverence of a man who had had enough of depending on magic. I took the train along the river, the mudflats spread like an old argument and the boats looking embarrassed for ever having believed they were essential.\n\nThe watchmaker\u2019s shop was not a shop so much as a room that had decided to remember its purpose after thinking about being a gallery. It smelled faintly of the kind of oil you only own if you own a screwdriver whose handle has grown glossy from use. Behind the counter sat a woman whose face had both kindness and a refusal to be hurried arranged on it in equal parts. She was Polish by the sound in her vowels and the anatomy of patience in her hands. \u201cIt runs,\u201d she said, after I had told her my grandfather and the shed and my father\u2019s stubbornness like a confession. \u201cBut it sulks. Hairspring\u2026\u201d She held it up to the light with the sort of tenderness you reserve for small animals and very old jokes. \u201cIt\u2019s tired. We don\u2019t replace tired. We polish it and we regulate it and we tell it the day is not an emergency.\u201d She set it on a small cushion like a bed and listened to it with a stethoscope the size of a button. \u201cYou have wound it like you are sorry,\u201d she said without looking up. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to wind it like you meant it. People do this,\u201d she added, and tapped the bench lightly with a fingernail. \u201cThey think time will be offended.\u201d She told me to come back Tuesday, which was to say, live a couple of days without insisting the past behave like a tool, and I went to the quay and watched the river thicken under a light that felt honest, and I went home and tried to be the sort of man who could use the oven without consulting the internet.\n\nImogen had stuck a hand-lettered sign in the caf\u00e9 window that read, \u201cJanuary: we bake through it,\u201d and underneath, in smaller writing, \u201cAlso the electricity bill has joined a gym and is very enthusiastic.\u201d She had acquired a ceramic penguin from a charity shop, which she kept moving around the tables with the erratic logic of a woman giving herself a game in a month that punishes illusions. \u201cIt\u2019s the size of a tiny baby and has the moral life of a teenager,\u201d she said, when I asked, and then she told me the landlord had suggested that perhaps the market would bear a little adjustment, and we stood in the doorway and let January blow through us until the idea of bearing anything felt ludicrous. We ended up arranging a night called \u201cPower To The Buns,\u201d because neither of us has ever met a pun we did not regret and accept in the same motion. Ollie made a poster that featured a lightbulb eating a scone, which looked exactly wrong, and a list of names of people who would read, sing, or otherwise permit themselves to be seen in exchange for money put in a jar. I wrote copy for it that tried very hard not to be pity and landed somewhere closer to invitation: Come in out of the weather. We will warm you by proximity and pastry. Bring coins. Bring hands. Try to leave lighter than you arrived. If you cannot, we will send you away with cake.\n\nThe night was one of those that make you think we have been practicing for this our whole lives: standing in too-small rooms and making more air by listening. The fairy lights did their low work and the coffee machine tried not to interrupt at the wrong moments. Imogen refused to take the microphone and then, in the second half, told a story about a bus stop in Salcombe and a woman who cried into her gloves and the thunderous relief of being permitted to sit near a stranger who does not make you explain yourself. Ollie read a poem that admitted the existence of a sadness he had not previously given papers to and a girl of about sixteen sang like she had learned to be brave by mistake. At the end, when we counted the jar in the kitchen with the honesty of people who know exactly which coins are which, the sum was enough, not to save anything permanently, because we do not tell ourselves that kind of story here, but to give the month a spine and the bill a rival. Imogen wrote the number down on the back of a receipt as if it were a spell and stuck it under the penguin with a kind of private ecclesiastical satisfaction. When we walked home along the dark river the lamps threw coins across it as if bribing the water to keep behaving.\n\nEliot rang on a Wednesday and did not abbreviate it. He had that particular London quiet in his voice that means a person is alone in a room and is pretending their aloneness is a choice. \u201cI have been offered a residency at a magazine,\u201d he said, and I could hear the capital letters arranging themselves as they left his mouth. \u201cIt involves being in a glass box twice a week and being watched while I write in order to prove that writing happens and is not a trick. The money is insulting in both directions. The concept is\u2026 you can imagine.\u201d I could. I could see him in a window where people buy linen, leaning on a sentence while a woman with a loyalty card wonders if she is supposed to clap. \u201cThey asked if I would consider inviting you,\u201d he said, and somehow managed to make the word \u201cinviting\u201d sound like a long corridor. \u201cWe could be clever about it. We could burn the box down with tenderness. I could wear a paper crown. I could refuse to produce anything legible.\u201d He laughed, and the laugh had the shape of a thing you keep until it either saves you or ruins your appetite.\n\nI thought about it in the way I am learning to think, which is to ask myself if the story that would be told about it would be one I wanted to watch, and if the person I would be in that story is someone I would lend my mug to. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be watched while I\u2019m not lying,\u201d I said, eventually. \u201cI already find it hard enough not to perform my honesty into a shape that suits. The box would be too much box.\u201d There was a pause that was not offended and not entirely relieved. \u201cTell them you\u2019re inventing a new residency,\u201d I added. \u201cTwo chairs not facing each other, once a week, two writers who are not trying to win anything. We could do it in a library and leave the door ajar.\u201d He exhaled in a way that sounded, for a second, like gratitude. \u201cYou\u2019ve become unfashionable,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very attractive.\u201d We arranged a date for him to come down and, for the first time since the talent show announcement, I felt the wire between us behave like string, which is to say it learned give.\n\nIsaac sent me a poem on a bad Thursday called \u201cWhat to Do When the Foxes Choose Your Garden.\u201d It began with the sound they make, described carefully and without drama, and proceeded to list instructions that would not fix anything and would make everything feel less like a verdict. \u201cYou could bang a pot,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut it won\u2019t make them move any quicker, so wash it afterwards and think you\u2019ve accomplished something.\u201d He had learned the shape now, the way a sentence can curve its shoulder around the fragile thing it is carrying without dropping it. I asked him if he\u2019d like to read at Power To The Buns in February and he wrote back that he would if he could bring his dad. I told him he could bring anyone who could stand and clap. When the night came, he stood next to the penguin in his school shoes and read four lines that made his father\u2019s face perform that ancient trick of pretending something else is making your eyes behave like that. His father, afterwards, waited until Isaac had been congratulated by enough women with nice hair to survive a week, and then he came up to me like a man who had decided to ask a question and knew he would have to do it without bluster. \u201cHe wrote that,\u201d he said, nodding at the space in which the poem had happened. \u201cAnd my chest felt like\u2026 not panic. Not panic, but the cousin of it, who turns up without bringing a casserole. Is that what happens?\u201d I said that sometimes it is exactly that and sometimes it is worse and sometimes it is the thing that will keep you from hitting someone who would later become a story you tell with unnecessary honesty. He nodded and did the British man thing of losing all his words at once and becoming grateful, and I told him he had done alright by breeding a boy who made a room behave.\n\nThe river came up one weekend in February the way it does every few years to remind us who owns this place. The boards went up along the quay with the speed of an old habit; the ducks looked offended on behalf of someone else. Imogen and I carried sacks as if we had been cast in a drama about resilience, and she shouted instructions at me using nouns I had never heard used like verbs outside a kitchen. People appeared with mops and sincere faces and the sort of camaraderie that flourishes best forty minutes into a catastrophe that is large enough to be meaningful and small enough to be contained. We moved chairs onto tables and tables onto counters and a child in a Spider-Man mask threaded himself through all of us doing his best to rescue things that were not strictly in peril. When the water pressed its forehead against the glass, pretending to consider coming in for coffee, I thought of how long I had lived thinking that weather was a thing that happened to other people while I arranged my sentences under kinder skies. After, when it retreated sulkily and left the smell of silt and relief, we scrubbed and laughed in the way that is not about joy but about endurance. Imogen refused to throw out the penguin because \u201che needs to see things,\u201d and afterwards he looked different in a way only we could see.\n\nThe reprint of the pamphlet arrived with an email that had the subject line \u201cWe did the thing,\u201d and a photograph of a pallet that looked like a giant\u2019s idea of Christmas. The brooch editor wrote that bookshops were requesting twos and threes in a way that made her fond of humanity and then sent me a separate message that said, \u201cA larger house asked if you\u2019d like a proper book,\u201d with a winky face, which is her way of placing a cushion between me and the furniture. Clemency and I sat at my table and drank coffee and she looked at me over her cup with the precise expression she uses for matters that could turn either into a feast or a migraine. \u201cWe can let them buy our dignity,\u201d she said, \u201cif we also make them buy you a jacket that is not a joke.\u201d She laid out the arithmetic of it, the way she does when she thinks I will hide inside the complication to avoid making a decision: advances and rights and deadlines like polite teeth. I made lists in the column of my notebook that says \u201cThings With Consequences,\u201d and wrote under it: what will you have to rush, what will you teach yourself to hate, what will you get to carry that you could not have carried alone. In the end we did the thing we do, which is say yes as if it is the first time we have been asked, and write a clause about the cupboard with the good mugs. The brooch editor sent a congratulatory email that read, \u201cWe will be jealous admirably,\u201d and I loved her in that moment like an aunt who knows when to arrive and when to leave.\n\nMy mother slipped on the step in her kitchen in late February and phoned not to report it but to ask if I had any spare plasters, which is our domestic euphemism for help. I went over with a bag full of uncertain solutions and found her sitting on a chair with a dish towel wrapped around her wrist and her mouth arranged at the angle that means she is behaving for my benefit. The skin was bruised but not broken, a small riot under good lighting. She told me, with the bored patience of a person who has had worse, about the neighbour who had started composting as if he were the inventor of the concept and how she had refrained from saying she had been composting since compost was called rubbish. We made tea in a way that made the kitchen remember why it had been built. I found an old elastic bandage in the cupboard where she keeps string and historical jam and we wrapped her wrist while she told me, without looking at me, that she had listened to the cassette again and this time she had laughed through the whole thing and then had to sit down. \u201cHe calls the robin \u2018Robbin\u2019 as if he\u2019s heard something about someone else,\u201d she said, and we both smiled the way you smile when you are letting something not hurt you on purpose. Before I left she insisted on going out to the shed to show me the way the light came through a crack at half past two and made a bright stripe across the bench exactly where my father had kept the small flat-headed screwdriver. We stood there while it did its afternoon miracle and I thought of the watchmaker telling me I was allowed to mean it when I turned something that had been asleep back on.\n\nEliot arrived the first week of March in a coat that had given up on keeping anyone warm and a bag of groceries he had bought because he had decided to perform normalcy and it had looked like this at the till. He put on my kettle like a man applying for a visa and unpacked fennel as if hoping to be forgiven before the smell arrived. We cooked in my kitchen with the awkward grace of two people offering each other an apology without agreeing on the terms. He cut onions with too much attention and cried with the concentration of a man who refused to make a metaphor out of it. We ate at the table, the watch ticking between us like a third companion who had agreed to refrain from comment. He told me he had started seeing a woman called Anu who asked him questions in a room with a rug, and I said, \u201cGood,\u201d as if he had remembered his keys. He told me he was learning to ask his sentences if they wanted to be cruel and to listen when they said no. I told him I was learning to forgive my worst drafts without congratulating myself for being magnanimous. We did not solve anything but we did not ruin anything, which, given our history, felt like a dare met.\n\nAt the next open mic, the penguin had acquired a badge that read, \u201cI survived February,\u201d which implies an administrative capability I endorse. Isaac read again and his father stood behind him like scaffolding. A woman from the college read a list about the things she puts in her pocket before going to work in the hospice and I stood outside after and let my chest hurt in the moral way. The men at Parc sent a new list for \u201cThe Cupboard\u201d via the governor, who had decided that perhaps sometimes rooms do not need to be watched to behave. It included, \u201cCount the crows and understand they have no duty to you,\u201d and \u201cWrite the name of the person you loved most with your wrong hand and see if it teaches you anything you can use,\u201d and \u201cLearn one new knot, not just so you can tie things down, but so you can unfasten yourself with competence.\u201d\n\nOn a Tuesday that pretended to be spring, the watchmaker in Topsham sent a text that consisted only of a photograph: my grandfather\u2019s watch on her palm, the second hand making its dignified laps as if nothing had happened. When I went to collect it, she explained, in the tone of someone who trusts you with facts, that the balance had been out, that time is a negotiation between desire and constraint, that regulation is not a trick but a kindness. \u201cYou will still have to wind it,\u201d she said, as if denying me a myth in which things fix themselves and stay fixed. \u201cThat will not change. Some work is meant to be daily. Otherwise you will think you have solved something that requires attention.\u201d I paid her and tried to tip, and she refused in the old country way that taught me a great deal about the kind of person I want to be when the world lets me keep being a person. I walked back to the station with the watch in my pocket and my hand on it as if it were an egg I could keep from cracking by tenderness alone.\n\nThe large house sent a draft contract that had more capital letters than sentences and a clause involving a podcast that made me feel like a man being told he must learn to yodel to qualify for a library card. Clemency and I sat again at the table while the river blew itself out into a respectable wind and worked through it as if it were a stubborn knot. \u201cThis is nothing,\u201d she said, brisk and warm. \u201cThis is a conversation we will have twice and then I will send an email that begins, \u2018As discussed,\u2019 which will frighten someone handsome.\u201d We called the brooch editor and promised her a seat at the launch because there are ways to retain decency inside the machine and one of them is to tell the people who made you feel brave you are not leaving them for better canap\u00e9s. In the evening I went to the allotment and put my fingers in the soil as if checking its pulse, and a robin\u2014an actual robin, smug as heritage\u2014sat on the fork handle and looked at me in that judgmental way birds do when they have decided to forgive you before you apologise. I misnamed it out loud, for form\u2019s sake, and the air did not correct me.\n\nAt the winter fair\u2019s late-arranged Spring Addendum, because this is a school and therefore any excuse for bunting will be found, I judged mini-eggs in nest cakes and discovered a new respect for the human capacity to arrange shredded wheat into the idea of safety. The headteacher introduced me to a boy who had written a poem with the line \u201cI am the part that stays up when the river lies down,\u201d and I resisted the urge to put him in my pocket for later. A woman I had once kissed badly in Year Eleven told me she had seen me on the television and that I looked taller and I forgave us both for everything.\n\nOne morning near the equinox I woke at five because an idea had come to sit on my chest like a caring cat. It was not a book; it was a list of ten letters to write to ten people, some of whom were alive and some of whom were not in a position to open the post. The titles wrote themselves on the page before the kettle had time to practice its opinions: To The Man Who Taught Me To Fold A Map, To My Teacher Who Let Me Pretend I Wasn\u2019t Crying, To The Judge Who Said \u201cOrdinary,\u201d To The Boy Who Thought He Had Invented Shame, To The Woman Who Put A Toastie On A Plate And Made It Medicine. I wrote the first one with my fountain pen because sometimes the antiquity of an instrument will make your better self appear. When I was done, I read it aloud to the plant that has refused to die, and the plant behaved like an audience and held its breath; then it rustled, gently, and I took that as literary acclaim.\n\nIt rained and stopped raining the way March does when it cannot decide which story it wants to tell. The city found its daffodils. The gulls argued as if the subject were new for them. I met Eliot at the station and we walked the long way to the caf\u00e9 so he could feed himself on the sort of buildings that had never learned to be ashamed of their age. He made a show of disliking the idea of scones and then ate two in a manner that would have made a vicar blush. We talked about the box again, and about the thing that happens when you let people watch you do something that is not a performance, and how it is not the watching that is the problem but the archive, the impulse to fix a moment so other people can admire themselves for catching it. \u201cI want to be unrecorded,\u201d he said, with a kind of defiance that felt like hope. \u201cJust for a couple of weeks. I want to be bad at something and have it not matter.\u201d I told him about the men at Parc and their lists, and he made the face they make in the city when a story arrives that cannot be improved by speed.\n\nOn the last day of the month there was a blackbird on the fence behind the allotment, and he sang like the city had made him responsible for something only he could deliver. I stood there with a trowel and a pocket full of seeds and let my face be what it was because there was nobody near enough to need saving from it. I could hear, distantly, the bells deciding to forgive us again, and closer by the sound of two boys practicing a dance badly and then better, and I thought, with the tidy satisfaction of a man who is learning how to count the right things, that I had written words this week that would not be ashamed to sit next to my grandfather\u2019s watch on the desk. I wound it again, later, in the window, while the river remembered how to be gossip and the light remembered how to be kind, and on the cupboard shelf the good mugs stood with the sort of generosity that never thinks to advertise itself.",

The hedges along the towpath fattened with intent, and the river changed its mind twice before breakfast, doing that pale glitter it reserves for mornings when you are inclined to forgive it for yesterday. I found myself counting birds without asking to, not in the scientific way that puts a person in a hat, but in the way my father did, calling them by their wrong names until the right ones arrived like cousins late to a wedding. The watch came back from Topsham with an almost imperceptible swagger, the second hand doing laps as if the course had been altered to suit its dignity. I set it down on my desk and it ticked with a remorseless courtesy that made my laptop behave for a day, perhaps out of respect, perhaps out of fear of being shown up by a thing you had to wind to make it love you back.\n\nThe library said yes to our not-a-residency, and I loved it at once because the yes came wrapped in a risk assessment that included the words \u201cbenign proximity.\u201d The head librarian, a woman who wore a cardigan like armour and whose smile had the exact wattage required to make teenagers return their books, led us to a corner between local history and music theory. We put two chairs there at an unshowy angle, so anyone determined to watch would have to tilt their head and discover the discomfort was their own invention. Eliot came down in a jumper that tried not to be expensive and a face that had resolved to be useful, and we sat for two hours not facing each other and wrote. People passed on their way to fines and forgiveness, some of them slowing to pretend they were interested in the shelf behind us, one or two going so far as to take down a book about canal engineering and carry it with the reverence of a prop that had found its way into their hands. A boy I did not know stood in the aisle for ten minutes and stared at his shoes until his mother arrived and sat down two tables away with the sort of patience that deserves a medal and is instead compensated with the soft satisfaction of watching her child pretend to be brave where bravery is cheap.\n\nIt is a curious relief to be seen in your ordinary position. I have become used to being asked to perform the domestic tricks of kindness at an angle that flatters the camera; sitting with my back neither straight nor slumped, arranging my mouth around a sentence that does not yet trust me was a defiance I did not know I needed. Eliot\u2019s pen moved with the determined indecision I recognise in men who have taught themselves neatness as an apology, and every now and then he would stop and look up at a light fitting as if it were a line break he was hoping would blink first. An elderly man approached at one point with a plastic bag full of past and asked us, without asking us, to explain what on earth we thought we were doing making a living out of the nouns other people use for free. Eliot told him, very gently, that we were practising failure in public so it wouldn\u2019t come as a shock later. The man nodded in a way that could have meant anything, took his books to the desk, and left a chocolate biscuit on the edge of my table like a tithe.\n\nClemency, who had been born between two meetings and will outlive several platforms, arrived halfway through and took a photograph so politely it almost didn\u2019t happen. She perched on the radiator and whispered a running commentary to herself about jackets she had seen that day that had not deserved their buttons, and then handed me a printout of a schedule that looked like it had been designed to punish indecision. The large house had put together a list of cities and dates that made my knees behave like someone else\u2019s, and the small press had countered with a list of rooms they could ask nicely and a bag of postcards that had been printed in a hurry and looked like it, which is how I prefer my future. We agreed, with the sort of speed only possible between people who already know the arguments, that we would call the book The Cupboard and arrange the essays like shelves, and that no chapter would be named after a virtue because the last thing either of us wanted was an index that sounded like a sermon.\n\nI went back to Parc with a cardboard box full of the zine the brooch editor had coaxed into being from the men\u2019s lists, and a head full of cautions about what it means to put a thing in print inside a place built to take away permanence. The officer with the wrist tattoo made a joke about autographing contraband and then checked my shoes for goodwill the way a parent checks a child for pockets full of frogs. The men came in with the energy of people who\u2019ve been told there will be something new and are prepared to dislike it on principle, because principle is a shield that gets heavy but does its job. We wrote more for The Cupboard, this time a column called \u201cWhat We Meant To Say,\u201d and there were admissions about considerateness given too late and jokes not told because the room could not be trusted and the formulation of the sentence \u201cI\u2019m not angry, I\u2019m disappointed\u201d as wielded by a woman who deserved better. At the end we put the zine on the table and the men handled it like a small skittish animal, surprised by its weight, embarrassed by their own care. The man with the ridiculous ears put his copy under his jumper against his chest and declared he would read it with the respect he had never afforded a manual.\n\nIsaac sent a poem to a competition and did not make the shortlist, and his email arrived with the politeness of a boy trying not to trouble a man he had only recently decided was safe. He wrote that he hoped he had not wasted anyone\u2019s time and that perhaps his foxes were a bit ordinary, and then he apologised to me for saying ordinary like it was a slur. I wrote back longer than I meant to and told him that \u201cnot what you win\u201d is not an alibi, it\u2019s a technique, and that there is a thinness to certain kinds of recognition that you only detect when you hold them against the light of an actual afternoon. I told him to meet me by the war memorial with two poems and a packet of crisps and we read under a sky that had elected to be complicated. He had made something better in the gap between sending and not being chosen, and I told him a thing I wish someone had told me when I was seventeen and inventorying my heart: do not confuse quiet with failure; some work does its speaking after you\u2019ve gone to make tea.\n\nImogen\u2019s landlord\u2019s idea about what the market could bear arrived on an official letterhead that looked like a man wearing cufflinks to a fight. She read it in the doorway with the dignity of a person who knows the difference between an overture and a threat, and then she called Ollie, who arrived with the relentless cheer of a person arming himself with posters. We convened an emergency of the sort that happens on pavements, where the wind has a vote and everyone\u2019s practical jokes about capitalism turn, inconveniently, into practice. Out of this, overnight, grew a club we called \u201cCustard First,\u201d on the principle that some pleasures should be brought forward in case they are cancelled later by men who have never put jam in anything with love. The poster was a daffodil with fangs. People came in the way they come when they have been given a chance to demonstrate that they can carry part of the weight and would like to be permitted to. A woman brought a cake she had described as \u201cunambitious\u201d and which turned out to have ambitions large enough to require a licence. A man donated the takings from his dog grooming business for the afternoon because his clients\u2019 poodles were experiencing a boom in self-esteem and he wanted to give back. We sold out of buns in an hour and I learned the precise dimensions of the human hand when it has decided to be a purse.\n\nEliot and I were briefly enemies again because of a paragraph neither of us wrote. A magazine decided that the narrative of rivalry wears well year-round and ran a feature on \u201cTwo Poets, One Country, Infinite Fuss,\u201d in which photographs from four years ago were made to look like photographs from two months ago and sentences we had said in good faith were knotted so that they resembled wrists bound for entertainment. He sent me the link before I could find it, which is either cruelty or mercy depending on the temperature of your spleen, and typed, \u201cI\u2019m sorry they\u2019ve made me into the person who says that about you.\u201d I wrote back, \u201cI\u2019m sorry they\u2019ve made you smaller than your worst day,\u201d and then I put my phone on the table and went for a walk in the rain because some work requires weather to complete. Later, when we met for the two chairs not facing each other, we did the childish but effective thing of swapping a line each from what we were writing and promising to treat it with the kind of respect we had decided to ask the world for. He gave me a metaphor about hunger that wanted to be a train and I gave him a sentence about my mother\u2019s hands that did not want to be pretty, and we both did slightly better work for the rest of the afternoon, which is an answer I will take.\n\nThe allotment woke with an offended cough, and I found weeds that had not existed in any previous cosmology making their intentions clear between the chitted potatoes. I staked peas with a desire that bordered on persuasion and accidentally planted runner beans in a formation that implied choreography. The man with the runner beans peered over the boundary wire like a neighbour in a children\u2019s book and made a suggestion about windbreaks that contained three decades of knowledge and the precise number of knots required for a string to act like a promise. We drank tea from a flask like a prototype of companionship and he told me that tomatoes are personalities, not plants, and that my father had once sworn at a courgette for behaving like a metaphor, which I found so exactly right I had to sit down. The fork leaned where it always had, an upward insistence against a world that sometimes refused verticality, and I liked it so much I left it there on purpose.\n\nMy mother\u2019s wrist healed with the furious speed of a woman determined not to be slowed for anyone else\u2019s convenience. She developed a new contempt for step stools and a fresh respect for the floor, and began referring to her body parts in the third person as if they were colleagues she had to negotiate with. We established a new ritual that neither of us needed until then: Tuesdays were shopping and swearing, where we went to the big supermarket on the bypass and said rude things under our breath about the way they have started calling bread by its first name. She pushed the trolley with the authority of a woman who has lived too many lists and I followed like a man learning the choreography of responsibility. In the tea aisle she told me, unceremoniously, that she had been to the solicitor and had made a will and that I was to promise not to treat it like news when she died, which gave me an hour of bad temper I expended on the incompetence of an avocado. When we got home we ate cheese on toast that failed to be beautiful and succeeded in being food, and she told me Aunt Joy had thrown the fascinator a birthday party in the hope of exorcising it.\n\nThe book began to be a book. I arranged the pieces into shelves and Lerato, the editor at the large house whose emails were all verbs and mercy, wrote back with notes that made me feel both found and corrected. She suggested that the essay about the cupboard should arrive later, not because it was less important, but because she wanted it to feel like a room we\u2019d been earning entry to, and I forgave her immediately because she had understood that a cupboard can be an ending. She asked if I had more about the men at Parc and I hesitated, because their lists are theirs and my job is not to colonise them, and together we found a way to talk about The Cupboard without pretending I had invented the idea that small tasks keep us alive. The title on the proof jacket looked like the name you give a ship that has no intention of sinking, and when the parcel arrived with two advance copies wrapped in paper that had decided to be modest, I opened one with the sort of care I normally reserve for birds that have hit a window and need to be reminded of the sky.\n\nOn a Sunday that smelled of wet dog and hope, the swifts arrived back in Exeter as if somebody had turned them on with their thumb. The air above Fore Street filled with their deranged sense of purpose and the city looked up with its mouth open, which is a look I recommend. It is impossible to be sincerely grumpy when the sky has decided to be a toy; even the cathedral, moody as a teenager before a school trip, offered sound that resembled enthusiasm. I wrote a short piece about them on the bench by the water, and it tried very hard to be a poem and refused, settling instead into the geography I have taught myself to trust, a list arranged in a way that allows a person to breathe. In it I wrote that swifts make a liar out of anybody who believes in neat returns, because they arrive as a mob and leave like a rumour, and that if we are understood by anyone with wings it is by accident and because we happened to be carrying a useful crumb. I read it at Power To The Buns and the penguin, who had survived a flood and a spring clean, glowered with the proprietorial expression of a bird that has never seen a sky and is fine with that.\n\nAnu appeared in Exeter with the aura of someone who has stopped a man from performing himself into collapse for a living. She was wearing a green coat the precise shade of the river on a good day and had thoughts about bread that made me wonder if she had come from a country where bread is taken seriously and not in a museum. She watched Eliot and me read above the bicycle shop and did not applaud at the wrong moments, which is how I know she loved him in a way that might survive an argument about fennel. After, we drank beer that had opinions and she asked me questions that were not about my work and nodded in a way that suggested she was counting my adjectives and deciding whether to permit me to use them next time. I liked her with the sort of ease that usually embarrasses me, and when she left I realised something in the room had relaxed that had been ready for a fight without admitting it.\n\nOn the day the proof was signed off, I took the train to Dawlish with my mother and we sat on the sea wall holding paper cups that promised coffee and delivered optimism. The air did the thing it does when it decides to be brine first and weather second, and my mother told me about a boy she had taught who had written an essay about rivers and used the word \u201csmug\u201d correctly, and how she had nearly thrown him a parade for getting it right. I gave her the proof and she held it with the careful disrespect she reserves for objects that are not going to tell her how to live. She told me the dedication was all wrong and then said it was right enough and asked why the cover wasn\u2019t blue, and I laughed like a man who had not spent three hours last week arguing about a title with the patience of a parson. On the way back she fell asleep the way only people who have earned it can, and I watched the red cliff faces perform their geology for men who take photographs of themselves in front of cliffs, and I decided that the next time the river sulked I would remind it that we are all behaving as best we can.\n\nLinda\u2019s cat learned a new way to look offended that involved an entire ear and the tilt of a head. She sent me a picture of him wearing, with the toleration of a saint, a ribbon that said \u201cSUPPORT STAFF,\u201d because she had been elected vice-chair of the parish fete committee by mistake and required moral muscle. Aunt Joy took up tap on a Wednesday morning class populated entirely by women who had learned that if you laugh first you get to control the joke, and sent us all a video of her feet functioning like punctuation under a sentence that had never previously known where to stop. Imogen raised her prices by ten pence and apologised in chalk for three days, and then allowed herself to be forgiven on the fourth and slept like a tree.\n\nWe did the first event for The Cupboard in Bristol in a shop that used to be a bakery and had not forgotten. People came wearing their best cardigans, some of them newly knitted into bravery, and brought their griefs in pockets and handbags like responsible citizens. I read the piece about the watch and the fork and the list of things you can do when the day is stubborn; Eliot stood at the back with Anu and made a face at a sentence I had not known I could write and mouthed \u201cYes,\u201d which, from him, is like receiving a state honour that has learned humility. Afterwards a woman with a voice like early birds told me she had wound her husband\u2019s pocket watch for the first time since he died and had expected a feeling like a poem and experienced instead a feeling like a shopping list, and we stood together in that and decided it was fair.\n\nAt the second event a man asked a weaponised question about whether kindness isn\u2019t just a way of prettifying complicity and whether there were not better uses for our breath. I told him that kindness is a technique for not killing each other on the way to the argument we ought to have, and that I am in favour of ferocity but have found it makes a better tool when it sits in a drawer with string and tape and a pen that works. He harrumphed with academic zeal and bought two copies, one for a person he loved and one for a person he had not yet decided about, and when I signed them I wrote his name with too much care and hoped he noticed the insult I had refused to deliver and the respect I had delivered instead. On the train home I wrote a letter to the man who taught me to fold a map, which turned out to be my father disguised as a geography teacher I never had, and I cried in that rigid way men do when they suspect anyone might be watching, and nobody minded because there were swifts outside and a timetable to consider.\n\nThe watch ran down one night because I had not wound it, and the silence woke me at two with the delicacy of a burglar who is careful not to tread on toys. I lay there and listened to the not-tick and thought about daily work, about the lie of permanent fixes and the mercy of rituals you can go back to without apology. In the morning I wound it with intention and then wrote five hundred words before I looked at my phone, which is, in this economy, a revolution. When I did look, there was a message from Lerato with an attachment called \u201cCOVER_FINAL_FINAL\u201d and a sentence about a blurb that had made her cry, and a text from the officer at Parc with a photograph of The Cupboard page on the education room wall with a fresh column added by one of the men called \u201cIf you can\u2019t sleep,\u201d which included, \u201crescue a memory from a thing and let it stay out all night,\u201d and, \u201ctry to remember your mother\u2019s handwriting without going to find it.\u201d\n\nMay was ambitious and tried to be August for a week, which made Exeter behave like a Mediterranean city with a quiet sense of humour. Imogen put tables outside as if we were Paris and the penguin disapproved in a way that made passing dogs suspect him of leadership. Isaac finished his exams and read me a poem about fatigue that made a better case for rest than any doctor I have ever met, and his father shook my hand as if handing me the portion of pride he could not carry back to the car without spilling. Eliot and Anu came down for a weekend and slept in my spare room on a mattress that has ideas about people, and we went to Dawlish again because the trick with the trains never gets old if you\u2019re honest with yourself. On the sea wall he admitted he had said yes to the magazine\u2019s box and no one had died, and that he had spent his first two hours in it writing a shopping list in Latin because he had wanted to get the exhibitionism out of his system. Anu said she had made him a sandwich the shape of his better self and that he had eaten it without comment, which is the most flattering thing I have ever heard about a man in love.\n\nOn the last Friday of the month we did The Cupboard in a church hall with acoustic tiles and an unapologetic smell of boiled vegetables. The vicar was a woman with a laugh that had survived more light switches than I have ever flicked, and she told me that if I made one joke about God behaving like an absent landlord she would put money in the jar and call it theology. We made a long list together this time called \u201cWhat to do when your mouth doesn\u2019t know how to say it,\u201d and it included, \u201cteach your throat to behave with water,\u201d and \u201cborrow a sentence from a book and sit it in your mouth until it stops biting,\u201d and \u201cwrite \u2018I cannot say this yet\u2019 on a piece of paper and leave it where you will find it on a braver day.\u201d At the end, the vicar bought six copies and the man who had asked about complicity apologised with the softest voice available to him, and the penguin, who had been watching from a folding chair, looked as though he would permit one hymn and no more.\n\nJune, while we were looking the other way, crept in and lifted the light to that late angle that makes even the tiredest of us consider staying up. The swifts wrote their arguments above the quay and the river decided to be a mirror even when it was not, and we sat in the library\u2019s two chairs not facing each other and learned to let the room carry us. The book entered the world like any other domestic object that had been worked on and not ruined: it found its place and, occasionally, resisted being used for what it was meant for. People brought it back to me with fingerprints in the margins and accused me of getting away with short chapters, and teenagers sent me messages in which they thanked me for making lists look like a sufficient way to move through a day. I wrote to the man who had taught me to fold a map and to the teacher who had let me pretend I wasn\u2019t crying and to the boy who thought he had invented shame, and somewhere between the letters and the lists and the watch\u2019s quiet insistence, I forgot for a week to be on television and remembered entirely how to be in a room where someone has left a mug for you on the good shelf because they thought of you coming and decided to count that as joy.",
