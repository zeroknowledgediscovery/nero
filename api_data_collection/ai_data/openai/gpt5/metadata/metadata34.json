     "novel_text": "Before dawn, the corridors sang for him. It wasn\u2019t anything out loud, just the whisper of mop water sluicing over varnished treads, the soft squeak of rubber on polished oak, and the faint hum lodged in Eddie Garside\u2019s throat. He tiptoed past the Year 2 cloaks\u2014army of tiny coats and dangling gym bags\u2014towards the assembly hall, where the stage was a table on trestles and the curtains were a pair of heavy brown drapes that smelled faintly of dust and something older.\n\nHe stood at the line of tape he\u2019d measured out himself, the one he told the children was the \u201csafe zone\u201d so they wouldn\u2019t fall off the front. The hall was empty and echoey in the way of places that have been full of noise all day. Eddie propped the mop against a radiator, imaginary crowd before him, and sang two bars of a song his mum used to hum when she washed up.\n\nA drop of water plopped onto the parquet.\n\n\u201cMr Garside,\u201d said the faint, startled voice of Mrs Pennington behind him. \u201cWe don\u2019t sing while the floor\u2019s wet!\u201d\n\nEddie jumped, then grinned, mop back in his hands like nothing had happened. \u201cIt was a soft sing, Miss. A whisper sing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s slippery,\u201d she said, but there was no heat in it. She was the headteacher and wore shoes polite enough to tap like a mouse. The silver chain around her neck caught the light from the high windows. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to hum, hum in the corridors where no one falls and sues.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Miss,\u201d he said. When she was gone, he sang one more line under his breath so small it could have been the pipes clicking into life.\n\nA caretaker\u2019s day is a list. Bleach the loos, check the playground, hoover the staff room crumbs from the sofa where someone always had eaten something spicy and regretted it. Replace the notice board pin tacked with \u201cWe raised \u00a3278.31 for the NSPCC!\u201d with \u201cRemember your trip money!\u201d with \u201cNo Nut Wednesday!\u201d until the edges of the blue sugar paper frayed like hair. He fixed wobbly chair legs with his little metal kit. He carried boxes of paper a ream at a time and his wrists said sixty in the morning and thirty by tea.\n\nBut in the empty hall, with its cut-out paper snowflakes yellowing along the windows because no one had changed the display since December, he sang. He recorded himself on his phone, an old one with a defiant crack across the back like a grin. He kept his recordings in a folder called \u201cWork Stuff\u201d no one ever opened.\n\n\u201cYou should be on the telly,\u201d said Jules from the reprographics room when Eddie shuffled in with a trolley full of paper and jam tarts. Jules was wearing his usual slogan jumper: I gravy you. He had a soft face and twinkly eyes and a way of looking at Eddie as if he was something fragile. He was also the only person who came to Eddie\u2019s open mic nights just to clap no matter what.\n\n\u201cTelly?\u201d Eddie pretended to be outraged, hand on chest, lab coat flapping open over his old polo. \u201cThat where the criminals go!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe criminals of taste,\u201d said Jules. \u201cThe warlords of warbling.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot warble. Belt,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI\u2019ve got belt. And some falsetto with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d said Jules. \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in the photocopier that whistles same time you hit that top F.\u201d\n\nOn the way home the city threw its old stones at him, in that affectionate way York has. You could fall over the walls almost. The Minster shoulders hunched against the sky like a gentle giant. The Ouse shining brown and a little sullen. Dog walkers going fast because rain had fizzed in the air all afternoon and finally thought better of it. Eddie cut down past The Shambles, where the tourists came in clumps, even in February, even with the cold that bit through a coat like a mouse through a biscuit. He had a route. He always had a route, otherwise he\u2019d lose himself in the day.\n\nIn the little flat above Mrs Khanna\u2019s newsagents, he kicked off his boots by the door, one then the other, heel, toe, heel, toe, a ritual. Someone had pushed a menu for a new pizza place under his mat. Someone had also left a wet patch which meant Maya from 2B had been out with the puppy. The puppy: chunk of bone and fluff and temper and some impossible ratio of charm to fury. Pickle, it was called. Pickle with the teeth like tiny white commas. Pickle with eyes that said What now? What now? What now?\n\n\u201cEvening, Ed,\u201d said Maya when he was fishing his keys from that pocket nothing regular ever stays in. She stood there with the puppy straining against its lead, front paws off the ground, back paws scrabbling to run, enormous ears standing out like satellite dishes.\n\n\u201cAlright, Maya. He\u2019s on one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always on one. Say hello, Pickle. Nicely,\u201d Maya said, and Pickle lunged, a small, determined cannonball. He almost took a stitch of Eddie\u2019s trouser. He almost tasted victory. \u201cOi!\u201d Maya yanked him back. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d Eddie said, which was true and also not. The dog liked him very much in the way toddlers like pushing a block over and over. The dog saw him and went \u201cThis is the man I chew.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s teething,\u201d said Maya. \u201cAnd you move funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a, you know, you sort of bop.\u201d\n\n\u201cBop?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike you\u2019ve got a song under your feet.\u201d\n\nHe smiled and did a tiny twirl to make her laugh, which she did, a bark almost like the dog\u2019s if you didn\u2019t know better. She was finishing a masters in something he couldn\u2019t remember the title of. She was always tired and clever and kind in a way that made Eddie stand up straighter. Her boyfriend, Tom, was nice in a bigger, looser way, and left his bike against the railings so it rattled every time anyone touched it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you one day,\u201d Eddie said to Pickle as he slipped into his flat. He didn\u2019t mean catch. He meant get like understand. He meant we\u2019ll shake hands.\n\nInside, he had a shelf of mugs from charity shops, each with a different cat printed on, even though he didn\u2019t like cats particularly, not in life; in ceramic form he loved them. He boiled the kettle. The window over the sink looked out onto the back alley where bins lived and foxes sometimes made a sound like they\u2019d phoned their mother and got bad news.\n\nHe sat at the little pine table he\u2019d sanded down himself and peered at the envelope on it. He\u2019d found it last night pushed halfway under his door, the way the kids pushed school letters under the staffroom door on their way past, as if paper wanted to be posted but didn\u2019t quite have the courage. The envelope was cream, the nice kind. His name on it, written with a bold felt-tip that wanted to be brush calligraphy and wasn\u2019t.\n\nHis hands were clean but his fingertips had little dry cracks from bleach, from winter, from years. He slid a finger under the flap and opened it carefully.\n\nInside was a letter on thick card. The letters were fat and gold. They shouted. They looked like they belonged on the telly. He barely breathed.\n\nWe are extremely delighted to offer you, E. Garside, a place\u2014\n\nHis heart did a little Irish bend at the E. He wasn\u2019t Irish. Someone, long back, had been. He\u2019d been told that at weddings by a cousin with a sharp chin and a dark laugh. E. Garside, he read again, and it looked right. It looked official. It looked like himself on paper.\n\n\u2014a place in the live final of this year\u2019s X Factor.\n\nHe put the card down, carefully, because his hands were shaking. He picked it back up, just to see if the letters were still there, if they\u2019d jump like fish. They were.\n\nHe had auditioned, hadn\u2019t he? He had, in a sense. Leeds Civic Hall, three months ago. He\u2019d queued in the kind of weather that likes to shuffle you around like a deck of cards. He\u2019d sung to a lad in a polo with a clipboard who had filmed him on an iPad and said, \u201cSweet, you\u2019ll get an e-mail.\u201d He had not seen the e-mail. He\u2019d checked his spam and his spam\u2019s spam. He had considered that he\u2019d put down the wrong address or that he didn\u2019t have the kind of face that gets e-mails.\n\nDelighted, he thought. Delighted was a word you could hold. He stood and did a small circle around his table, then a bigger one. He put the kettle on again because he\u2019d forgotten and then he forgot he\u2019d forgotten and boiled it once more. He took the letter over to the shelf and slotted it into the green biscuit tin where he kept the things he didn\u2019t want to look at too much in case they wore out, like winter gloves and old postcards from Blackpool and a photograph of him and his mum at Whitby, him with a lolly the size of his head. The tin sighed closed. The room buzzed.\n\nHe took it back out again. He had to show someone. Who?\n\nHis thumb hovered over his sister\u2019s name. Moira had two children and a husband who collected old bus tickets as if they were valuable fossils. She had a sigh that began in her shoes and travelled up through her bones. She loved him almost more than she could stand sometimes, and her love came packaged with advice. If he told her now, before it was on telly, would it unlock that sigh? Would it make it real?\n\nHe called Jules instead.\n\n\u201cJules of the printer,\u201d he said, too brightly. \u201cYou free?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor once, yes. I am merely a man in a room eating rice crackers in a T-shirt that says UNLEARN TO RELEARN. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got news,\u201d Eddie said. The word latched itself to his tongue. News. He imagined the old newsagents till ringing with it.\n\n\u201cTell me it\u2019s a date with Warwick Davis,\u201d said Jules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God, you\u2019ve finally got your bus pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cLive bigger.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, a hum. \u201cYou haven\u2019t\u2026 Ed? Not\u2026?\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t hang the sentence on anything delicate. He had to put it out there and step back. \u201cFinals,\u201d he said. \u201cOf the X-Factor. I\u2019ve only gone and made it to the finals.\u201d\n\nJules didn\u2019t speak for a heartbeat. Eddie could hear the little click of Jules\u2019 jaw as he closed and opened his mouth, the way you can when someone is about to clap but isn\u2019t sure how loud to be.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Jules said at last, wonderingly. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Golden letters. Official as a bus timetable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming over,\u201d said Jules, and the phone line filled with his rushing. Eddie put the kettle on again, then realised he\u2019d never actually poured it and his kitchen had the far-away shininess of someone who moves too fast. He washed three mugs, just in case.\n\nWhen Jules came up the stairs, Pickle hurled himself at Jules\u2019 shins in a paroxysm of opinion. \u201cBetter him than me,\u201d Eddie said from his doorway.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on the telly? You\u2019re on the telly?\u201d Jules said by way of hello, sounding exactly like the small children who spotted a local weatherman in the supermarket. His eyes were wet. That moved Eddie, because Jules used his tears wisely. He hugged him, sudden. Jules smelled of jam and a faint metallic undertone of ink, which was his smell always, but now it meant something else. It meant here is the first person who believes me.\n\nHe showed him the card and they read it together like a prayer. The card said there would be rehearsals. It said names of people Eddie had watched on TV on the sofa with a blanket and toast, people who had sat behind desks and made faces that were not cruel exactly but interested in the ways people could fail. It said a date. It said London. It was a leap. It was a fire.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going,\u201d said Jules. \u201cTell me you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill Mrs Pennington give me the days?\u201d he said, immediately stupid. He could feel himself putting a barrier between this and himself because he didn\u2019t want to smash into it and break his teeth. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the governors in. We\u2019ve got the junior production of Alice. We\u2019ve got\u2026I mean. There\u2019s glue to buy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Mrs Pennington can\u2019t spare one caretaker, Mrs Pennington can clean the loos herself,\u201d said Jules. \u201cTell her you\u2019ve got an opportunity. Tell her the city of York demands its champion sing.\u201d\n\nChampion. He was an old man suddenly with a cape. He snorted. \u201cChampion what? Mop-wielding.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeart-mending,\u201d said Jules. \u201cTea-making. You\u2019ll be yourself, Eddie, and that\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nThey ate toast, a second dinner, because news used up sugar. When Jules had gone, Eddie put the card away again and then\u2014unable to help himself\u2014took it out for the third time, like it might vanish if he didn\u2019t keep an eye on it. He read his name. He was there. He was going.\n\nAt work, he felt taller. He tidied the assembly chairs in sets of seven, the way the school liked, but he did it with a little roll of his shoulders as if he was already on stage. The children were a wave of small humans that hit him and receded and left debris\u2014stickers, sand, a sense of warmth. One of the Year 6 girls, Mia, said, \u201cSir, why are you smiling like that?\u201d and he said, \u201cBecause someone gave me good news and good news is a jumper you don\u2019t want to take off yet,\u201d and she rolled her eyes with a tweenager\u2019s grace and said, \u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\nAt break, he cornered Mrs Pennington in her office, where potted plants went to live forever if they behaved. He stood in front of her desk and tried to arrange his face into the respectful shape. He had the envelope in his hand, because he couldn\u2019t not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an opportunity\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it the boiler again?\u201d she said, automatically, her eyes flicking to the blue folder where the gas men\u2019s numbers lived.\n\n\u201cNo, Miss. A different sort. A performing sort.\u201d\n\nShe looked up then, properly. She had known him since he\u2019d started, nine years ago, when his hair had done something jaunty and now did something honest. She had been the one to say, \u201cYour voice is nice at assemblies, but perhaps not during a fire drill,\u201d which had been fair.\n\n\u201cA performing sort,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made the final. X Factor.\u201d\n\nThere was a time when people used to say that show in capital letters even when they were making fun. Now they said it with the mild smile of someone remembering they\u2019d liked a sweet that had gone out of fashion. Mrs Pennington did not laugh. She glanced at the envelope that he held like a passport. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026Ed, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014yes,\u201d he said, unable to find the noun.\n\n\u201cAnd you need time off.\u201d\n\n\u201cA little. I\u2019ll catch up on what I can. Night work, if you want. I can do nights.\u201d\n\nShe did not say no. She did that head tilt that meant she was making a list of cons and pros and making it look like listening. \u201cYou love this school,\u201d she said, instead.\n\nHe put his hand on the back of the cracked chair he was not allowed to sit on, because no one sat in the headteacher\u2019s office even if she\u2019d invited them to. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love those children.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. They\u2019re a chorus, on a good day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she said. \u201cBring me the dates. Put it in writing. We\u2019ll paperclip it to the governor\u2019s file so I can show them a paperclip. That is the extent of my power.\u201d\n\nHe laughed and thanked her and left before she could mind. He felt fizzy. The days bunched and fluttered like washing.\n\nHe told Moira on Sunday. She\u2019d invited him for a roast and he ate three roast potatoes more than anyone else because he had a stomach that could put away grief and joy and spuds all in the same slot. The kids ran around the table and under it. The dog\u2014Moira\u2019s old Labrador, gentle and greying, sleeping with one eye open\u2014thumped his tail like he approved of the conversation even asleep.\n\n\u201cYou are joking,\u201d said Moira, hands on hips. \u201cEd.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cEd.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe telly,\u201d he said, and he did a stupid little dance because sometimes with Moira you had to deflate your own balloon or she\u2019d do it for you. He showed her the card. She read it as if she was checking someone\u2019s spellings. She put it down and picked it up once more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll come,\u201d she said at last, that alarmed love in her voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll wave. We\u2019ll cry. I\u2019ll wear mascara that doesn\u2019t move in wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to cry,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI cry at adverts. I cried at that advert with the boy who gets a hamster and the hamster teaches him about climate,\u201d she said. \u201cI cried at a leaflet about hearing aids.\u201d\n\nHe told her he\u2019d call when he had the day. He told her he was fine. He told her\u2014unwise\u2014that he could do this. She hugged him in a way that put his whole head under her chin and made him feel thirty and also ten.\n\nThat night, he couldn\u2019t sleep. The wind did that whistle up the alley between the flats. He sat up in bed and thought about the minute he would walk across the stage. About the lights coming up from under his feet. About the shape of his hands, the exact angle he should put them so he didn\u2019t look like he was holding oranges.\n\nHe dreamed that the stage was a playground and he had to climb a rope and there was a dog at the top of the rope with eyes like black coins, waiting to see if he made it, tongue lolling, but not unkind. He woke with the certainty that the dog was a person with an opinion and that he must win him.\n\nThough he had not told many people, York is a small kind of big. The Polish man at the bakery said, \u201cYou will sing,\u201d as if someone had told him at the till. The lady at the post office asked for an autograph for her niece and then said, charmingly, \u201cYou can just sign it Tom Jones if you like; she can\u2019t read yet.\u201d\n\nHe made a list of songs on the back of a cereal box. He would not do the song everybody did. He would do the song that came back to him in the supermarket when he was choosing carrots. He would do something from the heart that didn\u2019t sound like kindness, because too much kindness is boring on telly; he\u2019d watched enough to know. He\u2019d sing something that had the crack of something true. He wrote \u201cHurt\u201d and then crossed it out because the last time he\u2019d tried that he\u2019d stood too close to the speakers and his ear had rung for two days as if a tiny bell had moved in. He wrote \u201cRun\u201d and then wrote \u201cNo.\u201d He wrote \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\u201d and looked at it for a long time and put a little star next to it because it had a big breath right in the middle and he knew where to put it.\n\nHe asked Jules if he\u2019d listen to practice. Jules said, \u201cYes, and also move that chair to your left because you look like you\u2019re waiting at a bus stop in a scandal.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of all this, Pickle grew. Puppies do that thing where you think you\u2019ve learned the volume of them and then they add an extra bit from nowhere. Pickle got longer. His legs turned from billiards to chopsticks. His eyes went from baby to teenage boy. He learned to sit and not to stay. He learned to paw and immediately forget the usefulness of paw.\n\nOne dawn, Eddie came down the narrow stairs, keys in his teeth because his hands were full of a crate of cleaning supplies. Pickle was outside the door of 2B, lead on but not attached because Tom thought shortcuts were faster than the seconds it took to do something properly. The dog spotted Eddie, let out a noise like a tiny horn, and went for his laces. In the balance, in the dance, Eddie stumbled and the crate tipped. Plastic bottles of wash fell and rolled. The one marked DEGREASER cracked its cap. A smell of orange and cloud tables rose and fell in the hallway.\n\n\u201cPickle!\u201d Eddie said, laughing and angry, those two brothers that look the same around the eyes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a feisty little bugger,\u201d Tom said, coming out in socks, one-hand texting, one-hand useless. \u201cGood boy, Pick! Go on, get him. Defend the realm.\u201d\n\nEddie stared at him because the thing that hurts more than a dog is a man who thinks the dog is funny from five feet away. \u201cPlease keep him in,\u201d he said, quietly. \u201cHe near had me down the stairs.\u201d\n\nTom smiled a smile that said football on TV and job not lovely but pays and girlfriend who rolls her eyes in jokes. \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not fine. He\u2019s a baby with knives.\u201d\n\nTom made a joke about that, and Eddie put his crate down and looked at Pickle, who panted, who broke into a sit like it was a sitcom and someone had shouted applause. The dog looked back with such untroubled want. Eddie crouched and the dog licked his fingers and the whole thing was ridiculous. This dog was fury and darling at once. This dog was York, and himself, and the show, and everything you love that might bite you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said into the fur. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll work it out.\u201d\n\nThe day the call came, he was in the caretaker\u2019s cupboard under the stairs, where mice used to be and now there were only old brooms and a smell of the 1970s. He had his phone on loud because his mind wasn\u2019t a sieve that day, for once. He looked at the screen and it said a number that wasn\u2019t York. A sharp, bright London number.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d he said, and he knew he had swallowed his name in the middle like a pit. \u201cYes. Hi. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that Mr Garside?\u201d said a voice with professional cheer.\n\n\u201cIt is. Yes. Hello.\u201d His heart was a washboard.\n\n\u201cHi, it\u2019s Lorna from the X Factor team. Are you having a nice day? Great. So I\u2019m calling to confirm that you received your final-stage invitation and to go through travel and accommodation info.\u201d\n\nThe cupboard seemed to go smaller and bigger. He leaned his hand against the shelf. He imagined savouring the words again later like sucking the salt off a crisp. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cFantastic. We\u2019ll need you in London on the Thursday before. We can arrange train tickets from\u2014let me check\u2014York?\u201d\n\n\u201cYork,\u201d he said, and the city hummed at its name in his ear.\n\n\u201cFantastic,\u201d said Lorna. \u201cI\u2019ll send you a link to a portal. If you could fill everything in by end of day? Brilliant. We look forward to seeing you. If you have any questions, call this number, but also we won\u2019t answer if we can\u2019t, so maybe e-mail. Have a nice day, Mr Garside.\u201d\n\nShe rang off, and Eddie stood in the cupboard for exactly thirteen seconds with his phone at his ear because he needed the dark to contain the voice. He came out blinking. The corridor looked ordinary, which was wrong. He wanted everything to have its shirt on backwards, to show that it knew.\n\nThat afternoon he walked past the Minster with a bag of potatoes and three onions because he\u2019d promised Moira he\u2019d make stew for when the kids came over on Wednesday. The bells spoke. They tell you you have a soul if one doesn\u2019t turn up on its own. He looked up. The sky was the perfect, thoughtless blue of nothing when you wanted something. People moved around him with supermarket bags, with tourists\u2019 cameras, with hats. He felt connected to all of them with a string that tugged once and then was still. Everyone looked like they were going somewhere important. He might be.\n\nBy the river, in the little wedge of garden where teenagers came to kiss and then pretend not to, there was a dog-walking class, five pups with their people, each pup prancing. Their tails stuck up like the aerials of remote-control cars. A woman with hair like a friendly storm called out, \u201cHeel! Heel!\u201d and an old collie watched from the side with the look of someone who once ran the country and now enjoyed retirement.\n\nEddie watched them with the expression he had when a choir hit a note good. It made his throat hot. It made him think of his mother again, of the way she had sung the end of songs too loud, as if she could finish them alone if she had to. He thought of his father briefly, as if he were a thread you could see on the back of embroidery but not on the front.\n\nHe went to The King\u2019s Arms that night to sing, because he needed to be heard by someone who didn\u2019t know him. The river lapped at the walls because it had been raining somewhere else. The pub leaned into itself the way old bricks do, warm, cramped. There was a woman at the front with a face like a map of roads leading home. There were two young men who were more hair than anything else. The barman was an old soldier. Eddie listened to a boy with a cheap Stratocaster who sang like a kettle nearly boiling. He listened to a girl who had the sort of voice that made you want to hand her a spare handkerchief every day of her life. He listened and was brave.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, folks?\u201d he said into the mic like he\u2019d always done. \u201cI\u2019m Ed, from St Olaf\u2019s school, and I\u2019m going to sing something old because my face is old and we belong together.\u201d\n\nThey laughed in that way that meant good. He sang. He chose the song he\u2019d chosen because the silence after the first line has to hold. He sang it and it held. It trembled like a bird in his palm and he did not squeeze. He let it be. He hit the big breath and it was fine. The woman with the road-map face put her fist on her chest like something had got free there.\n\nAfter, a man at the bar with a tie undone and a day on him said, \u201cYou should be on telly,\u201d and then laughed because that was the joke always. Eddie laughed too and said, \u201cRight?\u201d and both of them let it be.\n\nHe went home down the crooked streets and Pickle was in the hallway again because the hallway was a conveyor belt of people going somewhere else and the dog liked to observe traffic. Pickle barked once and then lay on his tummy, front paws under him, a little Sphinx. Eddie sat on the bottom stair and put his hand out. The dog put his paw on it like a handshake. Everything was ordinary and high.\n\nHe started to pack a bag without quite meaning to. Socks, the good ones. His best white shirt that wasn\u2019t very best. The black belt that made him feel like he had a shape. He put them in and took them out again because they looked lonely in the suitcase. He folded them with his hands that were rough and made them neat, which is the same as love.\n\nHe lay on his bed and watched the light from the street lamp draw a square on his ceiling and bleed away. He thought, foolishly, of what he would say if they asked him that telly question, that \u201cWhy now, why you?\u201d\n\nBecause I have carried things for a long time, he thought. Because I like people, and I like to hear them when they sing along, quietly, because it is a way to say the things you can\u2019t put on a form. Because I want my sister to have her cry and laugh and not worry about me for a five minutes. Because the world is loud with angry and soft with small kindnesses and something in between might be a song. Because of Mum, obviously. Because of Dad, too, a little. Because I want to see what the lights do to me.\n\nHe fell asleep with his mouth open and dreamed that the Minster was a microphone and all the city leaned in, listening, and what came out of him was not a note but something else entirely, a sound he didn\u2019t know and yet always had, like the way you can whistle by accident. He woke with his heart in a knot that wasn\u2019t unpleasant.\n\nIn the morning, his alarm didn\u2019t go off because he\u2019d turned it down instead of up because sometimes the world taps you on the heel when you\u2019re running. He made tea in a rush. He knocked over his favourite mug and it cracked and he told himself it was fine because cracks are stories.\n\nIn the stairwell, Pickle was there, of course he was, entire to his bone. He tugged at the lead and the lead slipped because Tom had used a clip that looked like it had been attached to a curtain one day. \u201cHold him a sec,\u201d Tom said, and let go without waiting to see if Eddie was holding. The puppy went and Eddie went and the stairs remember every fall they\u2019ve seen.\n\nThey didn\u2019t fall. Not that day. The dog hit the end of the lead and bounced back like a thought and Eddie grabbed the banister with his strong custodial hand and swore a soft, old-fashioned swear his mother would have liked to hear because it meant he was still the boy she\u2019d taught not to swear.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Tom said, not sorry at all, his hair perfect, his shirt open at the throat in that way that looks like you\u2019ve been having a conversation with a fence. \u201cHe gets excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe could kill someone,\u201d Eddie said, and Tom laughed because he thought everything was a joke until it wasn\u2019t. Eddie patted the dog\u2019s head because it wasn\u2019t his fault, he was a baby with a motor attached. The dog licked him so hard his chin went wet.\n\nHe left with the taste of dog on his face and the card in his pocket in its envelope like a heart with edges.\n\nAt school, he scrubbed an art room table where someone had drawn a guinea pig so full of love it almost got up and squeaked. He filled a bucket. He checked the doors. He watched an assembly where the Year 3s performed a dance about the Vikings that was scarier than it meant to be. He hid his phone in the locker under his jacket as if it was something precious and bad. He told Jules that the portal had asked for his passport number and he\u2019d had to go to the drawer where he kept all the papers that were half-important and none of them had the right names. Jules said he would bring his scanner, which was like telling someone in the 1800s you had an extra horse.\n\nIn the tiny window of quiet between school and evening cleaners, he sang in the hall again. The light in there did that slow sweet thing, and motes went up like applause. He did the first line and stopped and did it again and the second time it came better. His feet felt steady on the wood. He looked at the tape on the floor that marked the no-fall zone and he stepped to it and not over it because he had this superstition now that as long as he didn\u2019t put his toe across he could keep his life from tripping. He didn\u2019t tell anyone because it sounded silly out loud. He nodded to the imaginary band. He took his breath.\n\n\u201cMr Garside!\u201d called a child from the far door. \u201cThe toilets are out of order!\u201d\n\nHe stopped and let the breath out in a laugh, which is also a song. He went to see. The toilets were not out of order; the boys had put a sign because they wanted the girl\u2019s toilets. He removed the sign and told them about fairness like somebody\u2019s grandad. He heard himself and thought, God, I am somebody\u2019s grandad to a whole building.\n\nAt home, he opened his portal on the computer he kept under a tea towel because dust had done a number on the last one. He typed. He filled in boxes. Name, address, emergency contact. He wrote Moira and then looked at it and underlined it as if that would make her more contactable. He pressed submit and a little spinning circle danced so long his tea went cold and he had to boil the kettle again because life is a kettle.\n\nLater, on the phone, Moira said, \u201cHave you got your suit? No? You have to get one. You can\u2019t go on telly in your school trousers, Ed. They\u2019ve got bleach on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tasteful bleach marks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s couture.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting a suit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take you. We\u2019ll go to that place near the station where the mannequins look like disappointed history teachers.\u201d\n\nThey went, and she stood behind him when he turned in the mirror, and he saw her face in the glass and his in it, both of them considering. He looked\u2026 like a version of himself he didn\u2019t know yet. The jacket was slightly too long in the arms and he liked it that way because it felt like the suit was still asking permission to be his. He bought a tie even though he didn\u2019t intend to wear it. He liked the idea of a tie. He put it in his bag and petted it like a pet snake.\n\nSometimes he thought of the letter and the call and it glowed, and sometimes he thought of it and a small black moth of fear flew up. What if he was the wrong man for this after all? What if he was the right man in the wrong weather? He kept those thoughts in a different compartment, the one where he kept the socks that didn\u2019t match and his letters from people who spelled his name TBA.\n\nOn Wednesday night, when Moira dropped the kids and their noise in his flat because she had a late shift in a little cafe that served coffee so strong it came with a waft of old heartbreak, Pickle slipped his lead in the hall again. He barreled into the kids and they squealed in the good way and the parents of Maya and Tom were away and Tom was doing a long shift and Maya sat on the stairs texting, chin in palm, light on her face. The dog saw Eddie. The dog, who was everyday a storm with pretty rain, put his paws up on Eddie\u2019s thighs and looked up as if to say, Hello. As if to say, Remember me. As if to say, I will cause you problems and also stories.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be famous,\u201d said Mia, Moira\u2019s eldest, when she scooped the dog and made a noise in his ears. \u201cYou\u2019ll be like that woman from Bake Off. People will stop you and ask if you\u2019re Greggs. Can we name the dog Greggs? I want a dog called Greggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s called Pickle,\u201d Maya said, smiling at last, looking at Eddie from under her fringe like she\u2019d finally seen him with her whole sight. \u201cAnd he is an arse.\u201d\n\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d said Eddie, automatically, then laughed at himself because he was not in school.\n\nThat night, he made stew, and the children ate it like a song. He sat by the window with his cup and watched the street be itself. He watched a fox run the length of the alley like a note on a line. He saw, just for a second, the reflection of himself in the glass, and behind him, faint, the stage, not the hall this time, the big one, with its lights and its problems, waiting. He put his hand up and almost touched it, like touching an aquarium, the fish impossibly near.\n\nIn the morning, he would get the next e-mail. He would write the next line on his list. He would take the leash from Maya\u2019s hand and walk the dog the long way round, because the long way round sometimes gets you somewhere you didn\u2019t think to go. He would make a breakfast that involved three eggs because nerves eat protein. He would rehearse the patter with Jules. He would check his passport four times.\n\nHe brushed his teeth and in the mirror he sang a quiet little warm-up into the foam and the foam made him look like a man who had eaten a small cloud. He laughed out loud because the sound bubble in him had to pop somewhere.\n\nHe went to bed and lay not still. He thought he heard clapping, but it was the radiator doing the thing it did when the metal moved and forgot to be quiet. He closed his eyes. He held the card in his mind like a coin you cannot spend. He said out loud into his pillow, just to hear it: \u201cE. Garside, live final.\u201d\n\nThe room listened as if it had ears. The city leaned in. The tiny dog in the hall upstairs turned three times and lay down like a person in an old story, one where animals talked and wagged and bit and came back for more. He slept, and the world was the same and not the same, and he was in it, shining, a little, like a man in a suit who had set his shoulders and forgotten, for a moment, how heavy they could be.The e-mail came with no fanfare, just a soft ping that might have been the fridge reconsidering itself. He\u2019d left the laptop open on the pine table and the tea towel he kept over it like a modesty cape slid onto the floor without fuss. He was mid-egg, his frying pan doing that convincing song that sounds like accomplishment, when he saw the subject line: CALL SHEET \u2013 FINAL WEEK ONE. He wiped his hands on the tea towel, picked it up and forgot to put it back down again as he clicked. There it all was, a week spooling out in boxes and bold: travel, arrival, wardrobe, \u201cVT\u201d which he\u2019d learned was a small lie because it wasn\u2019t videotape anymore, it was just a name that hung around long after the tapes had gone. It said Lorna\u2019s name. It said Wembley, which did something fizzy in his chest even though he knew they\u2019d filmed in other places before. It said: You will perform your selected song for staging at 10:20. It also said: Please bring any personal items that make you feel yourself. He laughed out loud at that and looked around his flat as if to ask the mugs and the biscuit tin and the socks which of them wanted to come to London and be themselves.\n\nHe put three eggs on a plate and thought about protein with the solemnity of a teenage boy who\u2019d picked a diet off the internet. He didn\u2019t have to be at school for an hour. He put on his jacket and the scarf that always smelled faintly like last autumn no matter how often he washed it, and he tapped on Maya\u2019s door because he\u2019d said he\u2019d walk Pickle while she was at a lecture and Tom was doing a shift that began at some time he called stupid. She opened, hair up in a bun that had promised not to move and was moving anyway, and the dog heard the word walk in whatever way dogs do when you haven\u2019t said it yet. He was all spring, straight out into the corridor on his short lead, paws scrabbling, doing that rolling wave with his spine that still said puppy even as his legs tried on their idea of adulthood.\n\nThey took the long way. They went past the launderette where the owner had a habit of watching dramas with the subtitles on and the sound off as if he was translating life for himself, past the closed-up caf\u00e9 that would try again at eleven, past the place with the chalkboard that always said different things in big hopeful loops and never said \u201csoup\u201d for reasons of pride. Pickle stopped at every lamppost and read it like news, quick sniffs, a frown, a wag. Eddie kept his wrist steady like the dog class woman had shown, not a yank and not a let, just a quiet insistence that they were going this way, thanks, and the dog looked up at him occasionally as if to agree that yes, fine, but did you see that leaf. They crossed the little bridge over the beck and Pickle put a paw in the water and made a face like betrayal and then put his paw in again because betrayal is an interesting flavour.\n\n\u201cYou going to be famous, then?\u201d Maya said, not looking, as if it were a small comment about weather. Her cheeks were pink with cold; the kind of cold that thinks it is far kinder than it is because the sun is out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be on the telly for a second,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the telly will have other business.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mum\u2019s already told the WhatsApp group. She told the dance mums and the dog mums, which are crossover but not the same,\u201d Maya said. \u201cTom told his lot at the depot. One of them said he saw you in the pub and you sang an Adele but not in a girl way, in a bloke way, which I think is his highest compliment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s Pickle\u2019s sit?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn and off,\u201d she said, and the dog sat then as if he\u2019d understood irony. \u201cI told Tom about the lead. He said he\u2019d look at a better clip and then he bought a gadget for his bike instead. He\u2019s not bad, he\u2019s just\u2026 Tom is Tom.\u201d\n\nThey walked past the Minster\u2019s far shoulder where the stone has its own weathered plans, and Eddie felt that old tug again, that string between his sternum and the city. He bent and gave Pickle a scratch behind the ear when he didn\u2019t lunge at a pigeon. The puppy\u2019s eyes rolled sideways to watch him, pleased in a way that was honest and new every time. It occurred to him as sudden and soft as a cough that he loved this idiot animal. He hadn\u2019t asked to; it had happened while he was looking at other things.\n\nAt school, the staffroom smelled of toasted bagels and photocopier heat. Jules raised both hands when Eddie came in, like a magician about to make a dove appear. \u201cWalked past a sweater in a shop,\u201d Jules said. \u201cIt said X FACTOR DAD. I feel robbed of an opportunity. Also, you\u2019ve got an eight a.m. fire door inspection with the business manager who thinks he\u2019s MI5.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had worse,\u201d Eddie said. He slid the e-mail open and showed Jules the call sheet and let him skim, watch the lines make more sense to someone else\u2019s eyes. There were things he hadn\u2019t noticed; the long, important one that said: PRODUCERS TO SHOOT HOME VT MONDAY AM \u2013 YRK \u2013 SCHOOL/LOCAL AREA/FRIENDS. That made his heart do the thing it did when he almost knocked a mug off a table and then didn\u2019t. Jules read that line twice and then said, at exactly the same time as Eddie, \u201cWe have to tell Mrs Pennington.\u201d\n\nMrs Pennington took the news like someone receiving the announcement that a famous person would be borrowing their shower. She smiled in that careful headteacher way that keeps joy from interfering with paperwork. \u201cNo children\u2019s faces without parental consent,\u201d she said, immediately. \u201cNo filming in the toilets, which you would think would be obvious and yet, I feel the need to say it aloud. No jokes about the school being a \u2018stage\u2019, I\u2019ve heard them all and they make me fear for the quality of the nation\u2019s metaphors. And I want to see their risk assessment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come in every shot if you want,\u201d Jules said, from the corner where he\u2019d come with a stapler as if it were a shield. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you star wipes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not do wipes,\u201d said Mrs Pennington, with dignity. \u201cGet me forms. And for the love of healthy crumbs, Ming, please hoover the staff sofa before they arrive. That thing is a universe.\u201d\n\nLorna rang to discuss the plan and she had the warmth of someone perpetually at a brisk walk. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking shots of you at your school, you walking past a beautiful-yet-relatable local landmark, you with a friend whose top has words on it. If there\u2019s a pet in your life we can include or a child you\u2019re fond of who won\u2019t lick the camera, that\u2019s absolutely gold. Are you okay to talk a little about your mum?\u201d\n\nHe felt that small, private tug again, the one that said: you do not owe everybody your dead. \u201cI can talk,\u201d he said, which was true. He didn\u2019t say what he wanted to say, which was: I can sing her, which is different.\n\nThey came in a van that pretended not to be a van, white with the shame of logos peeled off. They had clipboards and those puffer jackets that either keep you warm or make you look employed. They put small lights where the winter was sulking and they put a fuzzy microphone cover on a pole and called it by a name that made it sound like a pet. The children went wild without moving from their chairs. There is a particular hum to a school when telly arrives; it is reverence and cynicism at once. The little ones stared openly; the big ones tried to look bored and failed at their eyebrows. Mrs Pennington stood with an expression like a bust of a Roman who has seen it all and will allow it if it doesn\u2019t mess the marble.\n\nThey filmed him sweeping, which made him want to laugh because of course they did. They filmed him holding the mop with his hand in a place his hand never went unless someone had dropped glitter and it had migrated. They filmed him in the hall with the light coming in sideways and the cut-out snowflakes clinging on like pensioners at a disco. \u201cJust sing a line for us,\u201d said a woman with a nice face, and he did, and even though it was his school and his safe, his throat did that thing where it thought of locking. He stepped to the tape on the floor. He thought of breath and the shape of his mouth and the sound came like it always had, a thing he didn\u2019t do so much as allow. In the tiny speakers slung around their necks, it sounded tinny and not like anything at all. On the air between them, it was a bell you hear and decide not to mention because you don\u2019t want to brag that you heard it.\n\nThey asked him about his mother and he said her name and watched Mrs Pennington look at the floor in a way that meant she was listening and also being decent. He said how his mum had sung when she washed up, yes, and how she\u2019d had a laugh like a cough and how she\u2019d once done a turn at a social club because somebody had dared her. He didn\u2019t say the bit about her being sad sometimes in a way that took the cover off of the world and made all the things inside cold. He didn\u2019t say the bit about her asking him who\u2019d mow the lawn if she didn\u2019t, because she liked the lawn and she liked to pretend that nothing else mattered as long as the edges were neat. The producer nodded at the parts he said as if she was thinking about edit points and cutaways of hands.\n\nThey went to the reprographics room and filmed Jules holding up a selection of ridiculous T-shirts for the camera and being their best production dream, which was to say himself in sharper focus. He winked at the lens like a man in a pantomime who\u2019d learned kindness late and was proud of it. He said into the boom, \u201cI gravy you,\u201d and the sound man laughed, an actual laugh, the kind you don\u2019t hear on telly. They stood him and Eddie together with the big old printer making its dinosaur rumble and the camera loved them because cameras love old friends who have no reason to be old friends except they chose to.\n\nThey wanted a dog. Of course they wanted a dog. Eddie texted Maya and she came down with Pickle\u2019s lead and a row of apologies already queued up. \u201cHe may eat your world,\u201d she said to the crew, and the crew said, \u201cPerfect,\u201d in a way that made Eddie want to stand between the dog and the boom. Pickle did, in fact, try to lick the fluffy cover off the microphone and the sound man said a very quiet oh, and Eddie found himself crouching and bringing the dog\u2019s face to his and doing the voice he only did to dogs and one particularly alarming toddler. \u201cNo, mate,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not lunch. That\u2019s a cloud. Leave it.\u201d Pickle blinked and left it and then tried to eat the lanyard of a young runner who laughed so hard he had to lean against the wall.\n\nThey took him to the Minster and had him walk with his hands in his pockets like a Victorian postcard of a thoughtful man. He did one take with his hands out because his pockets were his and he wanted the use of them, and the director said, \u201cCan you do it like you did but less hands,\u201d and he said, as politely as possible, \u201cI\u2019m from York; we\u2019re all hands,\u201d and Jules, who had come along with a bag of jam tarts because he was incapable of not feeding a crew, laughed so loudly a tour group turned. By the river, a swan glanced at them with the contempt only swans can manage, and Eddie tried not to think about the sawed-off story the show would make of his life, the neat little arc from mop to mic, as if the things in between weren\u2019t the point.\n\nAfter, the school felt thin with the absence of them and very itself. He put the bucket away in the cupboard under the stairs and stood for a second in the darkness listening to the building settle, a sound like a quilt being shaken. He had a train to catch in two sleeps. He packed in stages, clothes first, then the bits that made his mouth feel right\u2014a small tub of the fancy honey that had been a gift, a tin of mints he never ate but liked the idea of, his own pillowcase because hotel laundry smelled like sadness and fluorine. He put the suit on the back of a chair where it could watch him like a sensible friend.\n\nThe morning of travel, York station was a cathedral of steel and pigeons. The roof had its ribs out, proud and old, and people did the things they do in stations\u2014ran on crisp packet legs, stood and stared up as if salvation were on the departures board, hugged with a kindness that made Eddie look away because he did not want to be a witness to it unless invited. He had his case with its wheels that did that thing where they get ideas, and his suit in a bag which felt faintly absurd. He gave himself time for a tea that made its way into his hands in a paper cup too thin for love. A woman with hair like snow said, \u201cExcuse me, love, is that platform eight?\u201d and he told her and she patted his arm without looking and he felt upheld.\n\nOn the train, he found his seat by the window and pressed his forehead to the glass like a child until he remembered his forehead belonged to a man who didn\u2019t need a circle rubbed into it. Across the aisle, a lad with glitter on his cheekbone practiced a riff sotto voce and then looked up and saw Eddie watching and smiled with the roar of someone who\u2019d never learned to be embarrassed. He wore a jacket with studs on the collar and he looked like someone who would have been, in another time, the bravest person in a silent town, making the first noise. \u201cYou for the show?\u201d the lad said, the words rolling around his gum. \u201cMe too.\u201d He listed off a name that hadn\u2019t meant anything to Eddie last year and now meant the boy who\u2019d been filmed coming out of a lift during the auditions with his hands up, crying in disgust with his own happiness. The lad said, \u201cYou\u2019re the caretaker, innit?\u201d with affection rather than condescension, which eased something inside Eddie he hadn\u2019t noticed had tensed. They swapped first names and then both felt the pleasant oddness of knowing a stranger and then looked out of their windows, because northern men sometimes have to look at geology to come back to themselves.\n\nKing\u2019s Cross hunched into the day like a big beast. The roof was a lattice that reminded Eddie of the old playground climbing frame that had been condemned and made everyone sad. He walked past the tourists queuing to be witches and he smiled because he remembered a girl from last year\u2019s Year 4 who had cried at the idea that if you ran at the wall and it didn\u2019t open it might be your fault. Lorna was there outside Boots with a clip-board like an upgrade to a herald. She waved and kissed the air on both sides of his head and directed him into a taxi that smelled like five cigarettes had been smoked in it yesterday and forty eggs boiled in it last week. The driver had that London habit of narrating other people\u2019s bad decisions under his breath. By the time they arrived in the big, sensible hotel near enough to the arena that it looked like it might be under its skirt, Eddie felt both smaller and larger.\n\nThey gave him a lanyard with his name on, and he would have slept with the lanyard on if it hadn\u2019t felt like a betrayal of everything he\u2019d learned about strangulation hazards. The corridors were long and neutrally carpeted like a thought you haven\u2019t decided to have yet. His room was like every other hotel room and also not. He pressed the switch for the lights twice before he tried the slot with the card and remembered he needed to feed the room with the right plastic the way you feed fish. He put the suit in the wardrobe, which had those anti-theft hangers that made you feel like you were about to commit a very low-level crime. He texted Moira a picture of the bed with its rectangle of chocolate and she sent back: STEAL THE CHOCS IN THE HALL TOO and three kisses and then wrote, immediately, DON\u2019T, YOU\u2019RE ON CAMERA and then: JOKE. He lay on the bed in his clothes with his shoes off and allowed himself one heavy exhale and then got up because lying down felt dangerous.\n\nThe stage the next morning was not a stage so much as a small nation. It had steps that lit up if someone told them to and it had screens the size of confessions and it had a crew who looked as if they had been born fully grown in headsets. The first time he walked out, nobody looked because everybody was looking at everything else, and he loved that. He loved not being the point until he opened his mouth. He stood on the tape they had for him, a bright cross that made his own tape at school look shy, and he smiled at the floor because floors had saved him in his life more than anyone gave them credit for. A woman with an iPad introduced herself as vocal and asked him to do the song in his key then half a tone down then half a tone up and he did as he was told and didn\u2019t mind until someone somewhere in a bank of monitors said through a speaker, \u201cCould he do something more current?\u201d and he had to resist the urge to say, \u201cI am current, I am the current carrying the sound to wherever you sit.\u201d He said, instead, politely, \u201cThis one fits me like my jacket. I can stand in it.\u201d\n\nThey tried him with in-ear monitors, small rubber thoughts that sat in his ears and made his own voice sound like someone had pushed him underwater. He did it without and then with and then with one in and one out, and the stage manager gave him a look like a cat considering a leap. \u201cDon\u2019t pull,\u201d she said, as if he were a child and the wire were a tablecloth at a birthday party. The LED behind him looked like the inside of a crystal ball and Eddie had to stop himself from turning around and staring at it until someone told him to go home.\n\nIn the dull gaps that make up most of the life around the bright, he met some of the others, those brave kids and those grizzled boys and those women with eyes like trumpets. A mum from Milton Keynes who had three under five and still had lipstick and appetite; she shook his hand with determination and said, with that directness of the time-poor, \u201cIf I cry on telly please don\u2019t judge me, it\u2019s only because no one else cleans the bathroom properly.\u201d A lad with a name like a fruit who sang as if he\u2019d lost a bet with God but was going to win next time. The glitter boy from the train sang and made the hair on Eddie\u2019s forearms lift very small. The crew had that efficient style of care that is half-shepherding and half-kidnapping, and Eddie allowed himself to be placed and turned like a chess piece and did not mind because it was a privilege to be on the board.\n\nHe called Moira from the corner of the foyer under a rubber plant too shiny to have ever seen dust. The kids made three different noises down the line and the Labrador barked once in approval and Moira said, \u201cWe\u2019ve made a banner that says GO ON ED YOU BEAUTY and if the telly man tries to confiscate it I will cry and then I will write to my MP,\u201d and Eddie laughed in the way that relieved his chest. Jules texted him a photo of a T-shirt on a hanger that said SHOUT IF YOU LOVE FLOOR POLISH and then sent another that said THIS ONE SAYS \u2018BELT THEN BREATHE\u2019 SHOULD I BUY and Eddie told him no and yes, in that order.\n\nHe went back down for a last run and Lorna caught him with that neat lasso of hers. \u201cTiny thing,\u201d she said, which meant it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe might have a clearance issue with your song. The person who owns the writing isn\u2019t saying yes yet. Can you have a couple of alternates ready in your back pocket?\u201d\n\nHe could feel the tape in his chest trying to come unstuck. He nodded with care and said, \u201cI can,\u201d because he could, because he had a long list on a cereal box at home and most of the cereal had fallen on it and stuck and he had still kept it, superstition and glue. He went upstairs and poured water from a little untrustworthy kettle into a little untrustworthy pot that called itself coffee and tasted like an apology. He stood at the window and watched the arena\u2019s skin shimmer with its own business and he hummed something that wasn\u2019t the song he wanted and wasn\u2019t the song they wanted and was maybe his. He sang it under his breath and let it sit in the room with him until it became less shy.\n\nIn his head, he went back to the school hall where the light comes low and kind and to the smell of dust that knows all your names. He went back to York and its stones that had been looked at by kings and pigeons in equal numbers. He saw Pickle in the corridor, looking at him with that open-minded foolish love. He saw the tape on the floor and the line he put down himself and the exact place he stands and he thought, if the song shifts, the shape of me doesn\u2019t. He took a breath and held it the way you hold the hand of a child crossing a road, not tight, just steady, and when he let it go it didn\u2019t rag out of him like panic, it drifted in the particular way good breath does, like something that knows its job.\n\nHe slept poorly in the way hotel sleep is poor\u2014too hot where you don\u2019t want to be and too cold where you do\u2014and woke twice to the sound of laughter that might have been a television in the room next door and might have been his own thinking having a party. At six, his phone vibrated itself off the bedside table and he lunged with that reflex that belongs to people who have known damp and cracked screens. It was a message from Lorna. Can we meet in wardrobe at eight to discuss look? Also, clearance still pending. Have alternates. Sorry for short notice. X. The x felt handwritten even though it wasn\u2019t.\n\nHe stared at the message for a second, then got up and did the thing he could do: he made a list on the hotel notepad in the pen that had the hotel\u2019s name on and no ink for the first three strokes. He wrote: Wild Horses. He wrote: Harvest Moon. He wrote: The One He Should Not Touch, and crossed it out twice for luck. He wrote: A Change Is Gonna Come and underlined it and then underlined it again and then put a star next to it and then took his hand away because he did not want to wear out the paper where he might put his finger. He brushed his teeth and sang the bit that floated on the vowel and it sat right. He looked at his suit in the wardrobe and he looked at his old school trousers folded on the chair because he\u2019d brought them in case the suit felt like a costume. He touched the fabric of each as if he were making a blessing. The corridor outside his room breathed quietly through its air-conditioning and somewhere, miles to the north, a dog turned twice in a narrow hallway and lay down with a small grunt like an old man.\n\nHe went down to wardrobe. It was a room that looked like the mind of a person who can see colours inside numbers. There were racks that made a thicket of sequins. There were rails of black in case anyone had confidence. There was a woman with a tape measure who said, \u201cStand still, pet,\u201d and took his collar number like she was reading a coded message. They tried him in a different jacket and he could tell the exact point at which he stopped being himself and started being a version of a man the jacket imagined. He went back to his own. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d said the tape-measure woman, who had earned the right to say such things and not sound like a gift shop. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only thing I have to say.\u201d\n\nBy nine, he had sung every alternate in a corner with a chair that had begun life as a throne and then gone through a divorce. The sound of the building putting itself together was a kind of sea. Glitter boy lent him a throat lozenge that tasted of eucalyptus and effort. The Milton Keynes mum hugged him before her cue and left lipstick on his cheek and then came back and scrubbed it off with her sleeve with the brisk love of a nurse. In the gap before notes, when the stage was idle and the screens showed the log-in page of a computer someone had forgotten to put to sleep, he checked his phone and saw a photograph from Jules. It was the corridor at home. The sign on the noticeboard read: NO NUT WEDNESDAY! and under it, in Jules\u2019 careful print, someone had added, THIS INCLUDES TV PRODUCTION and Eddie snorted so loudly the stage manager glanced up.\n\nAt eleven, a man with hair better than some promises put his head around a door and said, to no one and everyone, \u201cClearance is through.\u201d Lorna appeared behind him with the expression of someone who had wrestled a dragon and only lost a shoe. \u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d she said to Eddie, just like that. \u201cYou\u2019re on. Do the thing you do. But at the end\u2026 more.\u201d She waggled her fingers in the international gesture for glitter and also for giving yourself away and Eddie nodded as if he might pick more up in aisle five. He went and stood on his mark and the lights woke like morning and he took his breath from the back and the ground and he thought of the corridor and the dog and the school and the jam and the way the city leaned to listen when he talked to it kindly and he opened his mouth and let it come.He didn\u2019t do the thing they all do where they stare down the camera like it owes them money. He looked out into the room, found the line of light that ran along the lip of the stage like a tide mark, and planted his feet like someone who knows about tides. The first note wasn\u2019t a declaration; it was a door opening. He let it swing on its hinges with the gentleness of someone who\u2019s been taught not to slam. The room, full of people whose job it was to be bored by noise, forgot for a moment and remembered to listen. It wasn\u2019t magic. It was breath and practice and the bit of the throat you don\u2019t own because it\u2019s a gift from somebody else. He thought of the tape on the hall floor and how he never stepped over it, and he found the equivalent here; the point where the note wanted to run away with him, and he held it by the hand instead.\n\nThe big screen behind him showed his own face, unhelpfully magnified, and then cut to his VT, a little film of his life, and he saw the school hall looking braver than it ever did at eight fifteen with the milk crates and a child crying because someone had sat on their sticker. He saw himself sweeping in a way that was a lie, too elegant by half, and Mrs Pennington with a plant on her desk like a moral position. He saw Jules lift a T-shirt and grin, and the camera seemed to have fallen a little bit in love with him, because of course it had, and he felt a ridiculous surge of pride on behalf of a man in a jumper that said PLEASE DON\u2019T TALK TO ME ABOUT BEES. He saw a quick flash of Pickle, pupils like two friendly buttons, a paw on Eddie\u2019s palm in a handshake that giggled. He almost laughed on the vowel, and then didn\u2019t, because he had work to do.\n\nWhere the song lifted, he didn\u2019t show off because he couldn\u2019t; showing off is loud and he had learned over years that quiet can be the bigger noise. He did the thing Lorna had asked for at the end, the \u201cmore\u201d, not with fireworks but by stepping forward that quarter-inch, by allowing the note to crack at the exact place it still sounds like truth and not like failure. It landed in the room with the private heaviness of an apology that means it, and for a second there was the delicious drop before anybody clapped, the moment that makes performers greedy for the whole weird business of being looked at. And then they did clap, and they stood, and the people who sit to be contrary stood too and pretended they\u2019d always been headed upwards.\n\nThe panel did their faces. He was far enough away to be grateful for distance. The nice one, the woman who had hands that spoke even when she didn\u2019t, leaned into her mic and said how she felt like she\u2019d been in her kitchen watching her dad sing on a Sunday morning and that it had made her want to ring him, which was not about him and exactly about him. The stern one, a man built like a verdict, made a joke about mops that nobody minded because he followed it with a note about the control in the soft bits. The one whose job it was to be fashion had a compliment that sounded like a brand of handbag, and then the boy at the end who wore sincerity like a cardigan leaned with his elbows on the desk and said, \u201cEd, I think people at home will have looked up and thought, oh, I know him. He lives on my street. He helped me carry a wardrobe once. More of that, please,\u201d and the crowd did the little murmur that means: we\u2019ve decided.\n\nHe said thank you in that way the show trains you to say thank you, but he added, because he couldn\u2019t not, \u201cI\u2019m from York,\u201d as if that explained anything. Something in the room moved its weight from one leg to the other. He walked off without tripping on a single cable, which felt like a win bigger than votes, because he had once snared his ankle on a vacuum cord in Year 1 and gone down in such a slow, tragic spiral that two children had applauded.\n\nBackstage had its own weather. The air was colder, the carpet had a long memory, and people moved with a purposeful, sideways gait, as if they were all trying to get around each other without waking a cat. He stood just behind the flats and let the flush leave his face the way steam lifts off a cup. Someone he\u2019d never seen before pressed a bottle of water into his hand with the grave courtesy of a person who knew where the spare batteries lived and therefore ran the world. Glitter boy, who had gone on before him and screamed joy so hard that a piece of the lighting rig might have reconsidered its life choices, head-butted his shoulder gently and said, \u201cYou ate that,\u201d in the tone of an artist agreeing to share a stage with a plumber.\n\n\u201cDid I?\u201d he said, because he\u2019d been in it and had the memory singers have of the thing they\u2019ve just done, which is a shape in the palm rather than a picture.\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said Lorna, appearing and doing a small dance of relief that made her headset wobble. \u201cWe got the bit with the hand. It was beautiful. And nobody cried grotesquely, which is Christmas for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s my fringe?\u201d he said, because there was nowhere safe for his humility to go and he had to put it somewhere.\n\n\u201cHonest,\u201d she said, which made him laugh and then swallow because the laugh threatened to turn into something that would make curious people feel they should pat his shoulder.\n\nThey shepherded him to a room with a high table and tea that tasted like a polite handshake. The others were in there too, the clatter of medals after a race nobody wanted to describe yet. The Milton Keynes mum was on her phone saying to someone, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, yes, you can put them in the bath together, the bath will not break,\u201d and then she looked up at him and mouthed you were lush and he mouthed back you too in the awkward sign language of people who know that voice is a limited resource. The boy with the fruit name sat, for once, very still, like someone had told him the chair was an animal that spooked easily.\n\nThey rolled the VT on screens in there with the sound off and subtitles on and he watched his own life with the captioned lies and the tiny truths. The words said EDDIE DREAMS OF BIG STAGES even though he didn\u2019t, not exactly; he dreamed of small rooms with good light and honest sound. It said HE WANTS TO MAKE HIS MUM PROUD even though she was past the making proud and into the part where the word is simply miss. It didn\u2019t mention Pickle by name, and he felt a ridiculous protective flicker about that, as if the dog had dodged a tax.\n\nHe went where he was sent and did the small things that pretend to matter. He stood still while they lifted his jacket at the shoulder and put a microphone back in the place promise lives. He let a woman with kind eyebrows brush powder across his nose because the lights had opinions about sweat. He answered into a camera: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m feeling good, I\u2019m feeling grateful, I\u2019m feeling like my shoes are on the right feet,\u201d and the runner laughed down his sleeve and Eddie felt comforted by causing one human to grin in a corridor.\n\nYork watched, because of course it did. In the King\u2019s Arms, the water licked at the stone outside and made the sound old pipes make in winter, and the regulars stood for his last note because somebody started it and nobody wanted to be the one who didn\u2019t. Jules had a table like a small landing pad piled with paper plates because he\u2019d brought a stack of jam tarts and then panicked and added sausage rolls just in case. He clapped at the television in the way that makes other people clap, and then the barman, who only applauded for military tributes and darts, hit the counter with his palm and said, \u201cThat\u2019s our lad,\u201d and looked annoyed with his own softness. At Moira\u2019s, the banner went up and then slid slowly down because the tape had ideas, and she cried before he even opened his mouth because she\u2019d decided it saved time. The children jumped on the sofa until her stern voice came out and told them the springs were for sitting, and then they balanced on the arms like little dangerous gargoyles, eyes round. In the launderette, the owner turned the sound up and three pensioners who\u2019d brought their wash in a single bag and a friendship that had outlasted three husbands and four cats pressed their lips in concentration, then softened. Mrs Khanna leaned on her counter and said to no one, \u201cAh,\u201d when he took the breath, like someone getting the right crossword clue at last. In the flat upstairs, the television flicker bounced in the gloom of the hallway and Pickle put his head on one side as if the sound had a smell. Maya shushed him and then said, apologetic for no reason, \u201cIt\u2019s Ed,\u201d like she had to explain the geography of their hearts to a dog.\n\nBetween show and results there is a long stretch of waiting that feels like a bus you\u2019re not sure is coming. They kept everyone busy because that\u2019s the trick. A small man with a laminated smile took them to talk to the online stream about what they\u2019d eaten and who they\u2019d bring as a secret guest if the world allowed impossible things. Eddie said, \u201cMy mum,\u201d and then, because he had promised himself he wouldn\u2019t offer her up for cuts and clip reels like a relic, he added, \u201cAlso my sister, because she\u2019d keep me humble and tell me to put my shoulders down.\u201d They took a picture with a light ring that made his eyes look like he had good news all the time, and then they put him in a little pen made of stanchions and tape and people with good will and told him to be surprised at things that had been planned all day.\n\nThe host, who wore satin like a joke on himself and had legs that understood stairs, said his name and other names and then stretched the words like bread that doesn\u2019t want to tear. It was all numbers and noise and the sound of own heartbeat, an old friend who sometimes knocks. Eddie felt behind him for his mark like someone feeling for a light switch in a rental. The lights turned a different temperature; the room did that thing where everyone inhales at once. He held glitter boy\u2019s hand without making it a thing and glitter boy squeezed like someone trying to crack a walnut and failing. Names were called, bodies went safely across to the next week, a tidal movement, relief and guilt and cheer all standing side by side looking sheepish. It got down to three bodies. Eddie\u2019s was one of them.\n\nHe felt the air thin, and the old stupid thought rapped at the door like a cold caller, the one with laminated leaflets. You are a caretaker. You care for things; you are not the thing. He told it, with obedience and then with steel, to wait in the corridor. The host read out a third name and it wasn\u2019t his. The bottom two were him and a boy who could bend notes into skateboards. There was a cheer, because crowds are strange and love blood in the way that never gets less bewildering the more you experience it. Lorna, just out of his line of sight, lifted her chin the exact amount that meant: breathe out, then in, then out. He did as he was told and had been telling himself to do his whole life. The host said sing-off like it was a treat. Eddie laughed, quietly and inwardly, because he had a second song in his pocket like a boiled sweet you keep for a bus stop.\n\nThey moved the furniture on the stage in that coordinate chaos that looks like a fight you don\u2019t want to break up because it\u2019s choreographed and nobody will get hurt. The boy went first and did that modern thing of walking and pleading. He ended on his knees in a way that might have been spontaneous and might have been science. The panel did faces. The room did a small, anticipatory hiss, the sound radiators make when they\u2019re about to get on with it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t change his mind. He did the one with the promise in it, the one he\u2019d written down twice and then put a star by because sometimes you need to speak a wish out loud and sometimes you let the song do it so you can get through the day. He flattened his hand on his stomach because that\u2019s where the voice starts, not in the throat, and he thought of all the small changes he had watched happen and the long ones he had hoped for and the ones you don\u2019t get to see, the way you plant a thing and the leaves belong to someone else. He started low, like stone. The note went up like a ladder he knew the rung distances of. He didn\u2019t climb out of himself, he stayed where he lived and let the room come to him.\n\nHalfway through, on the easy bit that looks hard if you\u2019ve only ever done shouting, he let a fraction of a smile happen. It wasn\u2019t to show off. It was because he heard, in the back of his ear, some long-ago social club and his mother laughing at the exact wrong moment and making it right by accident. The end came and it wasn\u2019t a punch; it was a held hand. He let it go. The room did the little silence again before clapping, and he took that into himself like somebody allowed him a second biscuit without a fuss.\n\nThe panel did what they do. The verdict man did a heavy sigh first, to show he understood the weight of everything, and then said the boy next to him deserved to be here but so did the man who made a room quiet. The nice one made a shape with her hands that meant shelter and said, \u201cEddie, that was church,\u201d in a way that didn\u2019t mention God and yet did. The fashion one said something about authenticity, which in another room would have made him bristle, but here felt like being told his shirt suited him. The cardigan boy said, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I want both of you to stay, but I need my mum to text me in ten minutes and say she felt less worried about everything for the length of your song, and that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s the thing,\u201d and the crowd made that sound that means they\u2019ve given their hearts to a stranger but they\u2019ll want them back by the end of the show.\n\nThe vote went to deadlock because of course it did, because the gods of ratings and pacing needed their coins on the eyes. They filled a minute with a recap of the two of them pulling faces like men on a carnival ride that had them in the wrong age bracket. Eddie looked down at his shoes because looking at your shoes sometimes tells you more than looking at a million faces. They were his own; he\u2019d buffed them in the hotel with a hand towel like the boy he\u2019d been at church who\u2019d learned to make leather shine when he couldn\u2019t control anything else. He had a random thought about the school toilets and whether the flushes were still doing that high, forlorn whistle because the caretaker from the agency didn\u2019t know you had to lift the cistern lid and nudge the arm. It soothed him in a way that felt silly and exactly right.\n\nThey said his name. They didn\u2019t say it wrong. They didn\u2019t add or take away letters. He recognised the sound of his own syllables in the mouth of a man who said five hundred names a night, and he felt a tiny spike of ownership that warmed all the cold places. He was safe. The boy next to him did a gallant nod that would do him well when he was older, and went off with the sort of grace that looks like it grew there but is always cultivated. Eddie stood there while the host did hand flutters and cheekbones, and he felt the weight leave his shoulders like someone had taken a bag off without his noticing the strap.\n\nHe went off as they told him, and in the corridor he breathed like normal again and then like happy and then like you do when you\u2019ve run for a bus and gotten it. Lorna kissed the air near his ear and said, \u201cRight, you have to do press,\u201d with the relief out of her voice now, and he followed the little red people with lanyards to a corner that smelled like wires and makeup.\n\nIt was the same questions with different eyebrows. How do you feel. What did that mean to you. Who are you thinking of. Are you the surprise of the season. He answered like a man who knows what questions are for; he offered pieces without laying himself on the altar. \u201cI\u2019m grateful,\u201d he said, and meant it like a slice of toast after a long day. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about my city. I\u2019m thinking about the kids at school. I\u2019m thinking about whether my sister remembered to defrost the peas.\u201d He said, because the cardigan boy had given him permission to say a stupid true thing and let it be, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about a dog who doesn\u2019t know what telly is and would eat it if he could.\u201d\n\nBack in his room, the quiet hit him like a duvet with a grudge. He turned on the small television because the little version of the thing you were just inside of is a weird comfort, like reading the leaflet for the museum you\u2019re already in. He watched the tail of the show catch itself and wag. He texted Moira, Are you up or are you up? and she wrote back in half a second with a photograph of her face shining and her eyes swollen and the children doing a victory pose behind her and the dog, the gentle Labrador, with his head on the sofa like an old cushion. She wrote, Mum would have called me up to talk about it for an hour and then told me off for the phone bill, and he felt the little punch of love that comes with a sentence that puts the dead in a room without your permission. He wrote back, We\u2019ll talk now and I\u2019ll tell you off, and she typed out a paragraph and deleted it and typed out another, and then called. He went to the window with the phone to his ear and looked down at the car park where a man in a high-vis jacket was laughing silently at something on his phone, bent double, a private happiness he had wandered into with his eyes.\n\n\u201cAlright?\u201d she said, the word a question that contained two decades and a lot of dinners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n\nShe took a breath that was half a sob and half a laugh and said, \u201cI\u2019m full of gravy and enthusiasm. I\u2019m not well.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nThey did ten minutes of words that were mostly noises and both felt improved by it. When he hung up, there was a message from Jules that said: You were not bad. I\u2019ve sent a blistering letter to the producers demanding more custard. Also, the sign now says \u2018NO NUT WEDNESDAY\u2019 in my handwriting and I am ashamed. He sent a photograph of himself in a hat that said CREW in biro and nothing else and his eyes were red not from sadness but that particular, lovely, late night arrhythmia.\n\nHe slept as well as a man who had been fed on noise can. He dreamed that the stage was the school hall again, that the LED screen was a big pinboard covered in sugar paper with titles like BIG DREAMS! and the staples made constellations. In the dream, he stood at the safe tape and a small hand slipped into his, not his own child\u2019s hand because he had none, but some generalised small hand that represented all the children he had taught to walk on clean floors. He woke up with his palm still slightly curved as if it had been holding. The room looked like a hotel room because it was. He did a little hum to check the voice was still where he\u2019d left it. It was, polite and ready.\n\nThe next day was mostly being shown rooms and then being moved out of them. He met a woman with a clipboard who had three watches and knew what time it was in all the places Eddie had never been. He did a radio show on a sofa that had seen better interns. He sat next to a comedian who had had his eyebrows threaded professionally and smelled of travel. He said Yonks without meaning to and the presenter said, \u201cOh, I love that word,\u201d and he thought of his mother and her bag of words like Weetabix and Fettle. He let the days flow over him like a river with occasional shopping trolleys.\n\nBack home, York did what cities do when a small story in its bones goes national. The paper at the station put his face above the fold in a way that would be used next week to wrap fish fingers. A tourist asked a tour guide, \u201cIs that the man from the telly?\u201d and the tour guide said, \u201cYes,\u201d even though he didn\u2019t know, because it makes stories stronger when you let them breed in the wild. The Minster did not notice him because the Minster has seen too much to clap, but a small boy on a scooter outside it said to his mother, \u201cHe\u2019s the singing man, he fixes the toilet,\u201d and Eddie, who was not there to hear it, would have been pleased to be remembered for plumbing. Maya found herself telling her tutor that her neighbour was famous and then felt immediately silly and immediately proud and sent a photograph of Pickle looking at the television with his head cocked and his ear inside-out to Eddie, who laughed in his hotel bed and saved it into a folder called \u2018Work Stuff\u2019 because of course he did.\n\nTom, who had watched at the depot because there was nothing else to do while the forklift was sulking, said to a man with a face like a thumb, \u201cThat\u2019s our upstairs,\u201d and the man said, \u201cReally?\u201d and Tom said, \u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d in a tone that included both apologies and ownership. Later, in the corridor that was always a little bit damp no matter how much the dehumidifier worked, Tom said, \u201cSaw you on the telly,\u201d and Eddie said, \u201cSaw you on the stairs,\u201d and Tom laughed like a drain clearing and, for once, clipped the lead properly.\n\nIn the school, Mrs Pennington printed out a photograph and put it on the noticeboard underneath NO NUT WEDNESDAY, then took it down because the picture had a child in the background whose mum didn\u2019t like photos and then put it back up again with the child sensitively cropped, which resulted in a laminated slice of Eddie\u2019s elbow that did not have the desired effect. The children made pictures of him with crayons that turned him into a superhero with a mop. Someone wrote in spidery letters, MR GARSIDE YOU ARE THE BEST AT CLEANING AND THE BEST AT SINGING AND ALSO YOU ARE VERY TALL, and he would keep that in the green tin for longer than awards are designed to last.\n\nWhen he came back for forty-eight hours, because the schedule said: RETURN HOME FOR VT TOP-UPS and he read it as: GO SEE YOUR PEOPLE, he went straight from the station to the school because he wanted to smell it. It smelled like glue sticks and faith. The Year 2 cloakroom tried to kill him with a bag strap and a shoe with a personality. He leaned into the staffroom and said, \u201cAlright?\u201d and the room stood up like a body with many arms. Jules had baked something citrus that looked like a flan and tasted like every good decision he\u2019d made in the last five years. Mrs Pennington hugged him, which she doesn\u2019t do, and then pretended she hadn\u2019t by immediately remarking on the bin rota. He went down to the hall at eleven and the light in there did the same old kind thing and he stood at the tape and sang one line for the janitor\u2019s cupboard just to be polite and the cupboard, being an inanimate friend, received it without comment.\n\nOn his way out, the corridor hummed with lesson time and a boy with hair like a dandelion seed head stopped dead and said, with urgent authority, \u201cSir,\u201d and held up a hand. Eddie stopped because a Year 1\u2019s hand has the power of a red light. \u201cSir,\u201d the boy said again, \u201con the telly, don\u2019t fall off.\u201d Eddie looked at him and it was like being given a helmet by a tiny knight. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d The boy nodded, satisfied, mission discharged, and went back to learning about owls.\n\nThat evening, on his own stairs, he met Pickle who did not try to eat his laces. The dog sat like he had decided that democracy was worth a go. Eddie crouched, rubbing the ears that had learned to be less pointy, and whispered into his fur, as if he were wild and needed coaxing, \u201cWe\u2019re doing alright, aren\u2019t we?\u201d The dog licked his knuckle with the solemnity of a notary public. Maya watched from the landing with her chin on the banister, the light catching the little flyaways around her head. \u201cYou were good,\u201d she said, simple as a glass of water. \u201cMy mum cried and my dad pretended he was cutting chillies.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them it\u2019s only telly,\u201d he said, and she rolled her eyes because she was twenty-three and had a glorious contempt for false modesty when it got in the way of a good clap.\n\nBack in London, the week had been laid out for him like a buffet with labels in two languages. Theme: Icons. Duets: Possible. Song choice: Negotiable if you argue nicely and bring a biscuit. He went into meetings where men in deceptively casual shoes told him about brand alignment and he nodded as if brands were furniture and he was measuring for skirting boards. He stood, again and again, on the mark that had become familiar and had the hum of something safe now; the stage no longer felt like a motorway at night but a well-lit bit of A-road with clear signage. He did the alternate in rehearsals so everyone would feel he was flexible and then did his own in the moment because he had decided that if he was going to go out he\u2019d do it wearing his own jacket and not someone else\u2019s.\n\nOn the Thursday before the next live, Lorna pulled him aside and told him they\u2019d like to try something with staging that suggested York without putting a cathedral on a screen. \u201cWe were thinking cobbles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were thinking a lamp with a long shadow. We were thinking, and this is me, not the team, a quiet dog in silhouette, just a joke for three people.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her, stopped in the corridor by the accuracy of being known like that without being consumed. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no silly flat caps.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo silly flat caps,\u201d she agreed, and in her voice he heard the apology for some previous silly flat cap inflicted upon an unwilling person.\n\nHe rang Moira that night and they said, at the same time, \u201cI\u2019m tired in the good way,\u201d and then laughed. He kept the television on mute and watched the replay of his own first week like it was a wildlife documentary where he was thrilled to see the animal had not fallen into a river. He laid his suit jacket across the back of the chair with the hanger still inside it, because he was a man who had learned some lessons from hotel wardrobes. He thought about what the nice judge had said, not the content but the tone, the way it had made his ribs spread without him saying please. He thought about how many days you get to feel that in a normal life and how none of them are promised and then he promptly thought about whether the caretaker agency had black bags or the flimsy ones, and he was grateful for his brain\u2019s loyalty to dim concerns.\n\nThe next morning, he walked past the arena\u2019s side door, where deliveries came and went like small ships. A man stood there in a parka smoking a cigarette with the dedication of an old world sailor. \u201cYou\u2019re the caretaker,\u201d the man said, not a question.\n\n\u201cAm I,\u201d Eddie said, smiling because sometimes it\u2019s sweet to be called by your function.\n\n\u201cMy missus cried,\u201d the man said. \u201cWhich is not your fault, it happens when she sees dogs on Instagram as well. But. You sang nice. It ran round the room and came back. Good lungs,\u201d and he flicked ash in a way that looked like punctuation. Eddie thanked him like someone receiving compliments on a roast potato, with careful deflection and genuine pleasure. He went in and let the door shut gently because he hates the sound of a fire door slamming, even in buildings where it is an acceptable noise.\n\nHe sang the song he was meant to sing and two he wasn\u2019t, and at the end of the day his throat felt like he had been laughing at a wedding and had to stop only when the vol-au-vents ran out. He drank water from a bottle with a sippy top without caring how he looked, because survival has no dignity. He sat on a crate with a sign that said DO NOT SIT and ate a banana Jules had pressed on him in a napkin on the platform like a protective auntie. He watched glitter boy teach a camera operator how to do a little step-touch and admired people who share joy like that without keeping score.\n\nThat night, he slept and the dream came again; the stage that is the hall, the tape that is the tape. Only this time when he went to that safe line, the small hand in his gave him a tug that meant, We could. We could go forward. Just a tiny overstep. He woke with his heart doing a tap that was not unpleasant. He lay there for a while in the hotel dark that never gets entirely black because electricity has opinions. He thought about rules he had made for himself that nobody else had asked him to sign. He didn\u2019t resolve anything. He got up and made hotel kettle tea that tasted like despair and metal, and he drank it anyway because strangers had put it in the room and he is polite.\n\nOn the night, they put the cobbles on the screen behind him. Not obvious, nothing that would make a resident point and say, That is a misrepresentation of our gutter pattern, sir, but a suggestion, a hint, the way a smell takes you to another room. A lamplight was placed at a polite distance, casting its little theatre pool. The silhouette of the dog turned out to be too much even for Lorna\u2019s sense of humour; it flashed up for half a second in rehearsals and the stage crew laughed, and then they decided to keep it to themselves, because there are jokes that exist just to lift a day and then go to bed.\n\nHe sang and it felt like a conversation with somebody who had been on a bus for a long time and needed to talk at a stop. His voice had the small, proud rasp that comes from effort and from not pretending you are something that you deludedly think you should be. He took the breath at the place he had taught himself to take it in the hall and he let the end do its little honest break. He stepped forward a hair\u2019s breadth from his mark, not to woo a camera, not to tick a box called \u201cconnection\u201d, but because he had decided his feet might like the closer air. If superstitions had lungs, his exhaled and smiled.\n\nAfter, back in the room with the tea and the chairs and the waiting, the Milton Keynes mum, who had gone out and returned and was vibrating with adrenaline and sugar, said, \u201cYou did the thing,\u201d and he said, \u201cWhich thing?\u201d and she said, \u201cThe thing where people at home forgive themselves for not being loud,\u201d and he wanted to write that down on the back of his hand, but he was the sort of person who would only smudge it, so he put it in his pocket with the boiled sweet.\n\nHe sent Jules a message that said, You watching or are you kissing someone, and Jules sent back a photograph of himself with the T-shirt that said BELT THEN BREATHE, perched on the pub stool like a small, delighted frog. He wrote, Kissing the idea of you, darling, and then Doe from Year 4 has been allowed to stay up and has drawn you with lasers coming out of your eyes and I don\u2019t know where she got that from but it\u2019s accurate.\n\nThere are weeks in a life that bunch together like unhelpful wires. These did. Between songs and set-ups and the odd corridor dance to keep circulation going, he found time for small kindnesses that were the only way he knew to make a room fit to be in. He lifted a cable for a man whose back had given out doing heroic work for years; he told a runner to sit because she looked like she\u2019d forgotten she had legs; he carried glitter boy\u2019s absurd boots from one side of the hall to the other like precious cargo; he let a woman cry into his shoulder about nothing the way people cry about everything, and didn\u2019t ask what the tears were for because they don\u2019t always need to be for anything and because he knows about mops.\n\nOn a long lunch break masquerading as a meeting, he walked outside. London had its smell on; dust and chips and rain thinking about it. He found a bench facing a bit of building that had been there before him and would be after. A pigeon with a chest like a proud grandfather hopped, considered, agreed with him about the bench, hopped on, hopped off, lived its shimmering life. A man from the crew sat next to him, breathed quietly for a bit, said nothing, left. Eddie thought of York, of the fossil river of the Ouse, of the way the city in its off-season wears its beauty like an old jumper and still looks handsome. He thought about the dog and whether someone had remembered to buy puppy toothpaste because the vet had said his gums would need friends. He thought about the school, about the little boy with the hand up saying don\u2019t fall off, about the sign on the board, about the brakes on the caretaker\u2019s van that had a language of their own. He felt simultaneously necessary and extra in the best way. He went back inside because there was air in there he had to use.\n\nOn the Sunday after two weeks of live shows, he got a text from an unknown number that started, Ed love, which meant it could only be from someone who\u2019d been given his number by someone who thought the world was smaller than it is. It turned out to be from an aunt on his father\u2019s side, a woman with jewellery that arrived in a room before she did. She wrote, Your father is so proud, darling, though he wouldn\u2019t go on the telly in case he saw himself, and Eddie stared at the sentence like it was an animal he didn\u2019t know whether to pet. He was not cruel. He wrote back, Thank you. Give him my love, which was the truth he could carry. He thought of his father mowing the lawn in long straight lines that made sense even when nothing else did and of how some men say I care about you in clippings and gutters.\n\nThey asked him for a duet for week four if he made it that far, and he said the name of a woman whose voice wore velvet and they laughed because of budgets and he laughed because laughter is the only answer to budget. They suggested a person who had once won something similar and turned into an album. He said yes because that was the game and because she had a nice smile that didn\u2019t look rented and because she shook his hand like his mum used to, from the shoulder. They sang together in a tiny room first, a rehearsal within a rehearsal, and for the length of a bridge he forgot he was someone who fixed chairs and remembered he was someone who could stand next to a person who had a big voice and not get knocked over by the wind of it.\n\nAt some point in the muddle of it all, he went to the Minster on a visit home, not for God, though God was welcome to eavesdrop, but for the acoustics. He stood at the back like he was a tourist in his own life and listened to someone practising something that meant business on the organ. The sound filled his ribs and arranged his organs and told him truths about pipes he already knew and was happy to be told again. He lit a candle because he always did, because it meant light continued without his supervision, because it was five minutes of beauty that didn\u2019t demand an underline. He didn\u2019t say a prayer because he couldn\u2019t think how to begin, but he thought a feeling and gave it the shape of his mother\u2019s name.\n\nWhen he left, a woman in a sensible coat with the look of an ex-teacher stopped him at the door and took his elbow the way Yorkshire women take the world and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve all been watching. My Jim says if you don\u2019t make it we\u2019re writing to our MP,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d and she said, \u201cWe know,\u201d and then added, because she couldn\u2019t help herself, \u201cAlso don\u2019t go flat on the end, it\u2019s not your best note,\u201d and he loved her immediately and sincerely and nearly cried with relief at the correction.\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel like a rise. It felt like a set of stairs. He took each, swore softly in the old-fashioned way when one had a tiny crick, put his hand on the banister for the sheer pleasure of wood. He thought, now and then, of stopping, of stepping off to the side and letting the ones with hunger that ate them from the inside race on. But the thing kept offering him little reasons to go on; a letter written in pencil from a child in Year 3 with spelling like a beautiful ruin that said, Dear Mr Garsid you maked my nan smile and she hasnt since grandad, a jam tart wrapped badly in clingfilm that had stuck to itself and been rescued by a neighbour, a message from Maya that simply read, Pickle hasn\u2019t chewed your boots today, progress!!!\n\nHe took the stage each week like a room he was allowed to use for a bit if he returned it in the condition he found it, but with a little polish. He did the thing he knew how to do: he kept his place. He sang with respect for silence and for the woman who had taught him to do the washing up in the right order so the greasy pans didn\u2019t ruin the clean water. When the end came\u2014and of course there is an end to everything, that\u2019s how we get to sleep at night\u2014it wasn\u2019t with a scandal or a miss or a bum note. It came on a week where he did something quiet and needed a hurricane, because sometimes the show wants a jacket thrown and he had buttoned his neat. He stood at the bottom of the stairs while the host shaped his mouth around words like journey and proud and slammed and he nodded and meant it and didn\u2019t die because he wasn\u2019t fifteen. He said into the camera and the room and whichever corner of the sky had decided to host him that he was grateful, and he said thank you to the crew and the panel and the children at St Olaf\u2019s who would be delighted to see him back and tell him his hair looked weird up close and ask if he\u2019d met any famous dogs.\n\nBackstage, in the little pocket of air where grief goes to see if it\u2019s needed, he leaned against a bit of flats and let it come up and out of him like the last bit of a breath you\u2019ve been saving for emergencies. People touched his shoulder in the solemn way the British have invented to avoid intimacy, and he loved them for it. The Milton Keynes mum squeezed him so hard his spine popped and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll keep in touch,\u201d in the way people always do when what they mean is, We will try. Glitter boy cried like sin and didn\u2019t care, eyes full of clean rain, and said, \u201cYou can have my boots,\u201d and Eddie said, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d and they both laughed until someone told them not to ruin their makeup.\n\nHe went back to the hotel and the room was just a room again, without the hum of live wires. He took off his suit carefully, like he was undressing a friend who was asleep on the sofa. He hung it up and patted the shoulder because he couldn\u2019t help himself. He called Moira and she answered immediately and said, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d in a way that meant, Are you still Eddie, and he said, \u201cI am,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood,\u201d and then they both cried in the selfish, happy way that people who are safe get to.\n\nHe went home on a train that seemed to think it didn\u2019t need to hurry. He watched the land flatten and then fold around itself, watched the mucky shoulders of fields and the shy approach of cities. He got off at York and the station did its old trick of making you feel like you belong to a story with steam in it. He walked through the concourse and a man in an orange vest nodded without making a fuss and a child pointed and then pretended they had pointed at something else, and a woman said, \u201cWell done,\u201d and he said, \u201cTa,\u201d and it was enough.\n\nOn his landing, someone had taped a sign to his door. It was written in three hands. The top, neat as clipped hedges, said: WELCOME HOME E. GARSIDE. Underneath, Jules had added, I GRAVY YOU, in a big victorious loop. The third, a spidery contribution from a child upstairs who still reversed their n\u2019s sometimes, read: YOU ARE FAMOS. Pickle barked once from behind a door and then scratched gently, which was new. Maya opened with a smile that started low and ended in her eyes. \u201cHero,\u201d she said, deadpan. \u201cHelp me carry this pram up; my friend\u2019s dropped it off and I\u2019ve immediately underestimated the concept of stairs again.\u201d\n\nHe picked up one end and they did the narrow-house carry dance, steps and pivot and respectful cursing. The building smelled like wet hall and lives. He put the pram down, scratched the dog, who had remembered how to be gentle in the two weeks he\u2019d been away, which is a miracle of beginning and persistence. He went into his flat. It looked like him. The mugs were where he\u2019d left them; the green biscuit tin sat with its ridiculous treasures. He put his bag down, heel, toe, heel, toe, and stood still in his own air.\n\nThe phone on the counter had a little blinking thing that meant messages, and he pressed buttons like a man in an old sitcom who has not yet worked out the relationship between technology and hope. There was a voice from the school, one of the office staff with cheer like a weapon, saying, \u201cCome in when you like, I\u2019ve told the cleaners to leave the hall floor for you because I know you like it how you like it.\u201d There was a voice he didn\u2019t know saying something about singing at a thing that sounded made up and he would decline politely in the morning. There was the voice he only expected when somebody had died and it wasn\u2019t; it was his father, with a breath between words, saying, \u201cEd. Saw you. Good lungs. When you can. Come for a brew,\u201d in the heroically uninformative way men of his village spoke. He stood very still, because moving might shake the phone and make the words fall off.\n\nHe took the tape out of the biscuit tin and put a new piece on the hall floor where the carpet had a small fray. He stood at it. He sang a long, low line, just enough to let the breath know he was home. The radiator did its gradual applause. Somewhere above him, the dog turned twice and slept. Outside, the city, which had survived worse and would survive better, leaned into its night. He made tea in his best cat mug, because sometimes ceramics give you permission to be sentimental. He sat at his little table that he\u2019d sanded himself and put his big, hard hands on the pine and let them rest, open, as if someone might put something in them. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do next in the way of television. He knew there would be glitter on his boots for months. He knew the school needed its hall done and the Year 3 toilets still squeaked like a bird with a secret.\n\nIn the morning, he\u2019d go in early, before dawn, and the corridors would sing for him again. He would hum while the floor was wet because he couldn\u2019t help himself, and Mrs Pennington, if she caught him, would say, \u201cNot while it\u2019s wet,\u201d and he would say, \u201cIt\u2019s a whisper hum,\u201d and she would pretend not to hear. He would stand the chairs in sevens and set the tape and watch the motes go up like applause. He would be himself. He would be more. He would be a caretaker still, with a capital that made sense. He would carry things, and he would sometimes put them down. He would pick up the dog on the stairs when he lunged and say, \u201cNot today, mate,\u201d and the dog would settle because even storms have eyes. He would sing in the hall because that\u2019s what halls are for and leave the door open a crack because sometimes sound needs a way out into the rest of a building. He would keep, in the green tin, a card with gold letters and a piece of paper with a crayon drawing of a man with lasers for eyes. He would be famous for exactly as long as it suited the world, and he would be known forever by the people who mattered. He would begin again, because that\u2019s the song he\u2019d been practising all his life.Monday morning put on its school cardigan and smelled of Pritt Stick and wet playground and whatever the cafeteria was threatening later. Eddie arrived before the sun admitted anything, keys ready in his hand like a priest with bells. The building breathed its old breath as he let himself in; he could have found the light switches blind, the way you can find the tap in your childhood kitchen in the dark. He walked the route he always walked, corridor to hall to toilets to staffroom, the way a person checks on sleeping children. His body did the list without his brain having to attend, which let his brain wander off and think about other business like a goat with a string on it. He thought about the call on his answer machine from his father that had said almost nothing and had implied the whole weather. He thought about the suit in his wardrobe and whether he could get the glitter out without giving it ideas.\n\nBy eight, the school began to fill with the small sound that starts a day; the voices in the distance, the zip of coats, the clatter of book bags, the holler of a name that is both a greeting and a warning. Mia from Year 6 came in wearing an expression that suggested she had invented the morning and would sue if anyone altered it. \u201cSir,\u201d she said, like a court officer. \u201cOn the telly you looked old. But good old. Like a radio.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cI will accept being a vintage appliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you meet Harry Styles?\u201d she said, as if he might have had time to pop into a boyband on the way to a studio.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, because he didn\u2019t and because honesty is the first lesson you owe children. \u201cI met a very handsome man who knows about sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame thing,\u201d she said, and swept on to her peer mentoring duties with the seriousness of a judge.\n\nMrs Pennington did her rounds with the list in her head and a biro behind her ear. In the staffroom she put a Post-it on the biscuit tin that said, Please leave the ginger nuts for people with sore throats, and then lifted it and, in smaller handwriting, wrote, But if you are sad, you may also have one. She came to find him in the hall because habit has as much gravity as the moon. They stood together in the back and watched the caretaker\u2019s day be itself. She said, with that particular warmth she turned on five degrees at a time, \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone full diva, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked the Year 2s to carry me from the gate like Cleopatra,\u201d he said. \u201cThey declined on health and safety grounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe governors would have opinions.\u201d She looked at him properly then, in a way she rarely let herself when things needed doing. \u201cYou did well,\u201d she said, short and simple, as if she were handing him a key. \u201cYou didn\u2019t embarrass us. That\u2019s my standard. You exceeded it.\u201d\n\nHe made a joke about standards so he didn\u2019t have to swallow around a lump that showed itself, cheeky and unexpected, like a child out from under a table. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman coming in at eleven to talk about headlice,\u201d he said, right back to business. \u201cShe says she\u2019ll need a socket.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course she will,\u201d said Mrs Pennington. \u201cParasites are hungry.\u201d\n\nAfter break, he went to the office and printed out a sign that said WELCOME BACK and stuck it up in the corridor at an angle that made Jules pretend to faint. Jules wore a shirt that said EAT THE RICH BUT MARINATE FIRST and had brought him a slice of something lemon that glowed like nobility. \u201cYou\u2019re still you,\u201d Jules said, peering at his face as if fame might have rearranged it. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief. I was worried I\u2019d have to start calling you Edward, like a posh sofa.\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cCall me Edward and I\u2019ll start making people\u2019s shoes squeak.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you get the message from your dad?\u201d Jules said, too casual to be casual. \u201cYou said you had one on the machine. You going to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d he said. The thought when he turned it over was sharp and dull at once, a butter knife that could still do damage. \u201cHe asked me for a brew.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery him,\u201d Jules said. \u201cDo you need me to stand outside the window and mime instructions for when he gets strange?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we can both do strange without instruction,\u201d Eddie said, and they smiled at the floor like men who know the floor keeps a lot of secrets.\n\nHe took the bus later because a bus lets you think without looking, and his legs were tired from the week in a way his brain approved of. He went to the estate where the houses sit with their shoulders together and said, to his reflection in the bus window, \u201cAlright,\u201d the way you do before a test you\u2019ve revised for and may or may not pass. His father\u2019s front garden was a work of geometry and stubbornness; the hedge was clipped with such obedience you could have used it for measuring straight lines. The path had been swept that morning, you could tell from the particular drag of the brush that left a signature like handwriting. He pressed the bell, then felt silly because his father had never believed in bells, and knocked. The door opened on the second knock because nothing in their family was ever allowed to be urgent.\n\nHis father was smaller, obviously, because time takes a little off the top and a little off the sides, but he wore his shirt with dignity and his hair had the exact amount of product it had always had, which was none. \u201cEd,\u201d he said, as if Eddie had gone to the shop for milk. \u201cCome in.\u201d\n\nThe house smelled of polish and onions and the faint, comforting ghost of damp that old walls keep around for luck. They went into the kitchen because kitchens are where you go to be honest in Yorkshire and also because the kettle was there, and his father put it on with the kettle\u2019s own fussiness. \u201cSaw you,\u201d his father said, looking at the spoon drawer because looking at his son would have made the spoon drawer redundant. \u201cOn the telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you,\u201d Eddie said, because sometimes you repeat the thing to make sure it\u2019s happened.\n\n\u201cGood lungs,\u201d his father said again, as if it were a diagnosis. \u201cYour mother would have\u2026 she would have had a lot to say,\u201d and there it was, the slight wobble that was allowed, the acknowledgement of the woman who had run the house now running everything else, somewhere you can\u2019t tidy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll pretend she\u2019s here and she\u2019s told us we\u2019re doing the tea wrong,\u201d Eddie said, and took the mugs down because the body knows the choreography. They drank, and they did it the way men do when the line is tight and you can\u2019t afford to wobble, every joke a little plank bridging a drop. His father showed him the new mower as if introducing him to a pet, and Eddie admired it with the proper ritual gestures, the nod, the hand on the handle, the observation about stripes. His father said without fanfare that he\u2019d kept Eddie\u2019s mum\u2019s headscarf in the drawer because sometimes when he was cross with the washing machine he needed to nod at it, and Eddie didn\u2019t cry because he wasn\u2019t allowed, but he looked away at the hedge and told it to stand very straight, and it did.\n\nOn the way home, he went past the little studio above the bakery near Fossgate where bands who looked like maths teachers recorded their albums that sounded like weather. He\u2019d been there once to pick up a microphone the school had borrowed and forgotten to return on time, and the man who ran it had said, in a voice like a bass line, \u201cYou sing, don\u2019t you,\u201d and he\u2019d lied and said he cleaned. The sign in the window now said, Special rate for local heroes, which made him snort and then consider and then stand in his own indecision like it was a puddle. He went in, because going in is braver than standing outside thinking about going in.\n\nThe studio smelled of fresh bread because of course it did and cables because why wouldn\u2019t it. The man behind the desk had hair that had given up and a smile that had not. \u201cEd,\u201d he said, because York learns your name and uses it. \u201cSaw you on the big shop. Congratulations. Fancy putting something down so your grandchildren have proof you were young?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot young,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cNot dead either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe make records for most quantities of alive,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou want to think about it. People will call you for a bit. You can go down to London and eat tiny sandwiches with discussions about next steps, or you can make yourself small and neat and honest in a room above a bakery and sell it to people who will give you a fiver and a promise that they told their aunt. Both are viable. One ruins your taste in tea.\u201d\n\nEddie laughed in that way that shifted something fragile into a safer place. \u201cCan we do it in the school hall,\u201d he said, because the question had been chewing the back of his tongue since he\u2019d sat under the studio\u2019s friendly ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s my room. It\u2019s got my sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring me an extension lead and two permissions and we\u2019ll make the walls sing,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring mics and a biscuit tin, you bring the voice,\u201d and it was sorted in the old way with a handshake and an implied invoice and the smell of bread.\n\nHe asked Mrs Pennington the next morning and she did her head tilt that meant, I\u2019m thinking about insurance and also trying not to be moved by sentiment. \u201cIf you do it after school,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t film children. If you credit the school in a way that will not result in angry letters from people who own logos. If you let the Year 4 recorder group have five minutes of your set to get used to microphones. And if you clear up afterwards, including any emotional debris.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmotional debris is my specialist subject,\u201d he said, and she made the face she made when she nearly smiled and then put it back in a drawer for later.\n\nIn the evenings, he went with Maya to the puppy class because discipline is easier in company and he liked to watch layered learning, the dogs and the people both. The woman who ran it wore practical boots and hope and had the patience of an airport. Pickle learned sit properly, not just the accidental sit of a dog who has run out of ideas. He learned leave it with a face like a monk turning down pie. He learned to look at Eddie\u2019s face when Eddie said his name, and Eddie\u2019s chest did a small, silly swell because being looked at by anything with goodwill is a tiny knighthood. Tom came to one class and stood at the edge like a scarecrow and said, \u201cHe likes you,\u201d and Eddie said, \u201cHe likes anyone whose pockets smell like chicken,\u201d and Tom laughed and then did a thing with his mouth like an apology he didn\u2019t know how to deliver. Later, on the stairs, Tom said, without looking, \u201cMaya\u2019s dad thinks you\u2019re good for her,\u201d in a tone that was trying to be kind and not managing it because it had rocks in it. Eddie said, \u201cMaya\u2019s good for herself,\u201d and then went into his flat and leaned on his own door because words are heavy sometimes.\n\nThe day the committee from the Minster rang him, the phone showed an unknown number and his stomach did a small mare\u2019s skit. \u201cMr Garside,\u201d said a voice with old wood in it. \u201cWe wondered if you might consider singing at our Christmas concert. We\u2019re trying to be both inclusive and not boring. You appear to be very good at making people who hate singing admit that they were moved.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s March,\u201d he said, because he had to say something.\n\n\u201cThat is when Christmas begins in Minsters,\u201d the voice said, unhelpfully. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk again. Leave space for it.\u201d\n\nHe hung up and laughed with glee at the absurdity of diaries that included December in spring. He told Jules and Jules was delighted inconveniently and started sketching an outfit on a Post-it that involved a cape and a holly-based epaulette. He told Moira and she said, \u201cIf you get near that altar I will combust,\u201d and then she told him to eat, because she was constitutionally incapable of not telling him to eat. He told his father and his father said, \u201cIt\u2019s big in there,\u201d which both was and wasn\u2019t advice.\n\nWord went around, in the way word does, that Eddie was doing a record. Mrs Khanna from the shop said, \u201cPut me down for two, one for me, one for my sister in Mumbai who collects British men with sadness in their face, she will like you very much.\u201d The Polish baker said, \u201cI will swap you a CD for a loaf and never stop that swap,\u201d which sounded like the kind of deal that lasts generations. A boy from Year 5 asked him earnestly if the record would be vinyl or \u201cold-fashioned on purpose\u201d and Eddie said it would be whatever the man above the bakery could get without selling a kidney. Maya pretended to be unimpressed in the way of someone who is delighted and very twenty-three, and Pickle sat on Eddie\u2019s foot while Maya talked, which in dog is a marriage proposal.\n\nThey recorded in the hall on a Tuesday, after the line of after-school clubs had cleared the door and the PE mats had been rolled into their blue cylinders like sleeping giants. The man from the studio arrived with his mics and his optimism and they placed them like flowers along the edge of the stage, where the good sound lives. He sang as if the building had ears, which it does. He sang the ones that suited the wood, and the ones he had picked in shops without knowing it, and he sang one he had never dared to sing out loud because it was the one his mother would have sung as a joke and then not as a joke. Jules sat on a chair at the back with a face like the moon and kept his breath as quiet as his claps were loud. Mrs Pennington drifted in and out with the look of someone pretending to be doing important things with paper while actually casing a robbery. The man from the studio stopped them after the second take of a thing and said, \u201cThat\u2019ll be the one, we won\u2019t do better,\u201d and Eddie felt the odd, rare peace of having done a thing exactly right in a room where he knew where every scuff on the skirting board lived.\n\nOutside, the light went blue and then navy and then velvet, and the school made the soft creaks of buildings that have done their job and are resting. They packed the mics like putting instruments to bed, and he walked around the hall with his hand on the chairs for no good reason other than love. On the way out, he found the Year 1 sign about owls still stuck to the door with Blu Tack that had gone grey with experience. He straightened it and smiled at the picture of a bird that looked more like a lemon with eyes than any owl had ever looked. He locked up with the prayer of a man who knows exactly how to secure a lock in a way that will not annoy the next morning.\n\nAt home, he made toast and put jam on it because jam is moral and sat with his socks on and listened to the takes on his laptop with his good headphones, which were not that good and had been repaired with tape that had lost its stick. It was odd hearing himself not in his head but from outside. He listened with the careful ear of a man checking a floorboard for squeak. He did not fall in love with his own voice because that would have been a betrayal of every boy he\u2019d been who had been told to button it. He allowed that the sound did the thing he meant it to do. He let himself smile, small, and then large when Jules texted, This is so handsome it should pay council tax.\n\nThe week moved in that school way that is both slow and suddenly gone. He fixed a wobbly desk with his little kit and felt temporarily like a surgeon. He took a splinter out of a child\u2019s hand and was thanked with a solemn look and a sticker that said YOU DID IT. He sat on the floor in the corridor with the yearbook committee and taught them the difference between serif and sans-serif because someone must. He had breakfast in the staffroom one morning with a yoghurt that had seen better days and thought, in that sudden way you think while stirring, I could be elsewhere, and then slightly scolded himself because elsewhere is a preposition pretending to be a plan.\n\nOn a Saturday in April, the river decided it liked its banks less than usual and came up to lick the bottoms of walls. The King\u2019s Arms did its famous thing of shrugging and putting its furniture on bricks. Eddie stood on the bridge with a bag of carrots like an old mathematics problem and watched the brown water give him a calm he couldn\u2019t have bought. Pickle, on his lead because they had all learned, peered over with sensible caution and then sneezed at his own boldness. Maya said, \u201cTom\u2019s moving to Hull for a bit,\u201d without preamble, the way some sentences need to be said before they can be understood. He looked at her and said nothing for a second because advice would be a cheap sweet right now. She added, \u201cHe says it\u2019s a job and I believe him and also I don\u2019t believe him. Both are true. We\u2019re not\u2026 you know. And I am fine. I am fine like a plate with a chip, but you\u2019d still put cake on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d always put cake on it,\u201d he said. \u201cEven more. People like to eat cake on plates that have seen things.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, tired and bright. Pickle leaned against Eddie\u2019s shin because he had decided to lean there. The dog had got bigger without telling anyone and had learned that strangers were mostly stories that turned out alright. Eddie scratched his ear and thought that some men turn into dogs and some dogs turn into men and both are improvements on certain afternoons.\n\nThere was, because there always is, a man in a suit who wanted him to do an advert. He met him in a hotel lounge that had been decorated by someone with a powerful interest in cushions. The man said words like exciting and opportunity and synergy without irony, and Eddie smiled with his polite mouth and nodded with his head while his spirit made a sandwich and stood by the window. The advert was for a cleaning product that had chosen the slogan FIND YOUR SHINE and the man wanted Eddie to sing in a corridor while a child in a tutu slid across a floor like hope. He tried to imagine himself doing it. He tried to imagine the school watching and laughing with him not at him. He tried to think of money as commas in a life rather than a sentence in its own right. He said, \u201cLet me think,\u201d and the man said, \u201cOf course,\u201d in a way that meant, Decide quickly because the world rolls, and Eddie left with a mint and the relief of being outside a room where decisions had to be made.\n\nHe sat with Jules in the reprographics room and told him and Jules said, \u201cDo it for the money if you want the money. Don\u2019t let your heart be the face of anyone else\u2019s soap. Also, the photocopier\u2019s developed a new whine in E minor, it\u2019s absolutely vile, I love it.\u201d Eddie nodded and put the advert in the same drawer of his brain he kept Christmas until November and the phrase bone broth. He would open it if he needed it and if he didn\u2019t, it could stay there politely and gather dust.\n\nHe had the odd night now where someone would ask him to sing in a room where you don\u2019t expect singing. He sang at a retirement do for a headteacher who had been at the school so long she\u2019d taught parents and then their offspring to hang their coats. He sang at a fundraiser for the local hospice where the room was full of people who clap like prayers. He sang at the market on a Saturday morning in exchange for a bag of apples and he sang at Jules\u2019 cousin\u2019s wedding because Jules\u2019 cousin had eyes like diamonds and wanted the aisle to be a question with a nice answer. Each time, he did his job the way he always had, and when the breath came right and the note sat, he was quietly grateful to muscles and luck.\n\nHe went to see his father again on a Tuesday, because Tuesday is a forgiving day. They did their ritual. They looked at something that was not each other and spoke about something that was. His father showed him a photograph he had found of his mother in a red cardigan with the sleeves pushed up, singing into a wooden spoon with a laugh that showed her back teeth. \u201cShe would have liked to be on telly,\u201d his father said, and Eddie said, \u201cShe was, once,\u201d and his father nodded because this was not a correction you could fight. On the way out, Eddie tidied the shoes by the door because he could not help it, and his father pretended not to see and also stepped over them with a tiny, grudging appreciation that might have been a thank you.\n\nIn May, the school got a notice that the council were sending round someone to check the fire doors and the PAT testing and whatever other acronyms keep children from electrocuting themselves. Eddie prepared the building like a mother-in-law was coming. He replaced batteries with the concentration of a man defusing a small bomb. He put signs at child height. He made the corridors smell like oranges and discipline. The man who came had a clipboard and an expression like an unmade bed and said, \u201cNice work,\u201d as if he were awarding a knighthood, and then ticked boxes so thoroughly Eddie wanted to take the biro out of his hand and have it framed.\n\nIn July, when the light finally acted like a friend rather than a drunk who might fight you, the city had its summer fair by the river and Eddie had a slot between the ukulele club and a man who made animals out of sugar. He sang three songs and watched the way people listen when they are not obliged to by tickets and seats, the particular quality of attention that feels like a child offering you a shell. He looked out and saw, to his great alarm and gratitude, his father at the back in a hat that had belonged to a friend and a smile that had never belonged to anyone else. After, his father shook his hand with more solemnity than the paper had needed when Eddie was born, and said, \u201cWell done. You made the air different,\u201d which was almost everything.\n\nHe was halfway through August when the letter came from the Minster with its posh paper and its plan. The carols, yes, but something more. Would he consider guiding a community choir for an evening in November as a rehearsal for the rehearsal, a way of making new voices less frightened of stone and people. He went in to meet the Canon who had the kind of handshake that made you imagine they\u2019d leave butter in dishes at room temperature so it spread properly. The Canon said, \u201cWe have too much of the shiny sometimes,\u201d and gestured at the ceiling which was older than ambition. \u201cWe need the other thing. You\u2019re good at the other thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrdinary,\u201d Eddie said, because the word had become his friend and he was unembarrassed by it.\n\n\u201cOrdinary the way bread is ordinary,\u201d the Canon said. \u201cWhich is to say, necessary,\u201d and Eddie said yes before he had time to think of reasons to put it off until his retirement from everything.\n\nOn a Sunday in early autumn, when leaves tried out their showmanship with bravado and premature crumbling, he and Maya took Pickle to the big field at the back of the museum where dogs have political meetings. Pickle had learned to return when called and then forget a minute later and pretend it was a new concept, like an old man refusing to understand contactless. Eddie threw a ball and Pickle ran with the devoted idiocy of the young and brought it back as if he\u2019d never been away. Maya talked about her dissertation as if it were a living creature that left hair on the sofa. Tom had gone to Hull and sent texts like postcards, brief and sunny and not answering the questions asked. Maya had begun to wear a look in her eyes that meant, I am future-proofing. She said to Eddie, \u201cYou know when people ask you what\u2019s next and you want to say, the washing up?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next is we get through Tuesday. What\u2019s next is eggs. What\u2019s next is I don\u2019t forget the blue bag with the dry cleaning in it like I did last time. There\u2019s a carol service in December which might break me. There\u2019s a child who is going to audition for the school play and think about it every day until she dies. There\u2019s a man who is going to offer me money to sing about soap again. There is a puppy who is going to decide at an inconvenient moment that fox poo is a cologne. There is everything, and also, right now, there\u2019s this field.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him with that fondness you have for a friend who is a bench. Pickle attached himself to Eddie\u2019s trouser leg like a badge and then let go and bounded at a spaniel with the arrogance of a toddler at a teenager. The spaniel bore it manfully and then taught him a quick, clean lesson about personal space, and Pickle came back to Eddie with the affronted dignity of someone who has been told to mind his manners. Eddie crouched and scratched the muscle at the back of his neck and said, \u201cGood lad,\u201d and meant, Good lad for learning. Maya sighed like a woman able to see several possible futures and picked up the lead as if it were both a rope and a ribbon.\n\nThe record came back from the place where they make things flat and real and it felt ridiculous and thrilling to hold a square with his face on and his name. He had not let them airbrush his laugh lines because they were his favourite proof that he had laughed most of his life. He and Jules had spent a stupid evening arguing about font sizes until their eyes crossed and had settled on something that looked like it had been painted by a steady hand on a fairground ride. He did a little signing in the bookshop that still smelt like books and was run by a man who had read most of them. People came in and bought two and made him write to Auntie Jean and to Sarah who had the thing and to a man called Big Dave whose real name was David and who was not big but had arrived at the nickname in honour of his personality. He wrote nicely because you owe legibility to those who love you.\n\nWinter went up in the city like someone had hung fairy lights on the bones of the year. The Minster put on its own clothes and the market smelled of cinnamon and damp wool. He ran the rehearsal for the choir with the care of a man carrying a cake down a narrow street. They were a raggle, gloriously. Teenagers with fringe and fury, men who had come because their wives had told them to and then found themselves enjoying the vowels, women who had been told they couldn\u2019t sing by tiny tyrants in childhood and were there to disprove a myth. He stood in the nave and made a joke about God\u2019s acoustics and watched the fear leave faces like a tide met by a contrary wind. He taught them about breath in the way his own body had learned it; not as a performance trick but as a way of staying alive. By the end of two hours, the Minster had turned them into singers the way a good pan turns ordinary into stew.\n\nHe got told off by the Canon for swearing very gently when a top note slipped away. He apologised and blamed the weather and then blamed his mother in the way that excuses nothing and explains everything. He looked up at the stone that had been touched by more hands than anything else he knew and made a promise that was not to anyone in particular. He would keep being himself even when the room required a different shape. He would tidy up after the show. He would leave the hall better than he found it.\n\nThe evening before the carol service, with lists taped to his fridge and his suit shaken within an inch of its hope, Eddie was in the stairwell tying his shoe when the dog downstairs began their usual pre-walk semaphore. Pickle did three small barks like punctuation and then a silence, which was unusual because Pickle respected commas but was contemptuous of full stops. Eddie went down with the plastic bag for bins that you carry even if you are not the dog\u2019s owner because God watches. The corridor was empty and the dog was not where a dog should be. He heard Maya\u2019s voice from the street, the particular pitch she used when asking the universe not to make a fool of her. He stepped out and saw the lead trailing like a question mark and the little crescent of black-and-white shooting towards the end of the road where the cars took the corner like a dare.\n\nHe moved without thinking in the way you do when someone else\u2019s heart is running into traffic. He did not shout because shouting is sometimes fuel. He made himself small. He went to the dog\u2019s left because that was the side they\u2019d trained him to read. He crouched in the road like an idiotic supplicant. He held his hand out flat because that is the shape of safety. \u201cPickle,\u201d he said, but not the hurry Pickle, the good boy Pickle, the voice with a story in it about treats and sofas. The dog, skidding on his own bravado, recalculated faster than most men would. He zigged, zagged, considered the bus and decided not, and lunged for Eddie\u2019s palm like he\u2019d been born for it. There was a car, of course there was, with a driver who had something on their mind that was not puppies or singer caretakers, and for a second that stretched out and examined itself, Eddie thought this is the exact shape of the way luck ends. He got his hand on the collar and turned in a way he had not turned since he was twenty five and thought dancing was something you could learn in a corridor. Something in his knee expressed an opinion that involved an ouch, and then there were hands and voices and Maya\u2019s sobbing laugh and the driver\u2019s apologetic swears and the smell of tarmac that you only notice when you are very near it.\n\nHe sat on the curb with the dog in his lap like a wartime photograph. The dog licked his chin and his ear as if checking he hadn\u2019t died, and Eddie said, \u201cI\u2019m alright. I\u2019m alright,\u201d in the way you say it to convince the air. Maya sat on the pavement and cried with her whole lovely face and petted the dog and Eddie in equal turns, and then they all laughed because laughing is the country you return to when you have been on a border. The driver said sorry again in a voice that made him sound like someone\u2019s son, and Eddie said, \u201cIt\u2019s roads. Roads do this,\u201d and meant, It\u2019s life, and the driver nodded with a relief that made a space appear around him.\n\nHe went upstairs, eventually, after everybody was done being a person in public, and sat on his floor with his back against his sofa and iced his knee with a bag of peas that had been promised to a curry. He looked at his suit and imagined singing in the Minster with a slight limp, and thought that if there was anywhere you were allowed to walk like you had learned something the hard way, it was a church with stones that had seen swords. He texted Lorna, out of habit, to say, No telly tonight, don\u2019t worry, and she sent four kisses and a photograph of a cat as if to counteract the adrenaline. He told Jules he\u2019d nearly been run over by fate and Jules sent back, In this house we do not get run over by fate without texting me first, and then came round with Swiss roll and an ice pack, because that is friendship\u2019s dialect.\n\nHe slept hard, the sleep of the nearly-hurt, and dreamed that the hall\u2019s tape moved itself forward an inch without asking him, mischievous and right. In the morning, he tied his shoe with care and looked in the mirror and saw a man with a line down the side of his face where nerves had misplaced his smile for a second and then discovered it again. He ate eggs because nerves like protein and honey because courage likes sweet, and he put on his suit and he stood for a second in his own doorway and he said, \u201cDo the thing you do,\u201d to his reflection, because sometimes you have to be your own Lorna. He stepped out into the stairwell, which smelled of dust and effort, and went down, steady, one step then the next, because stairs are just songs you do with your legs. He met Pickle on the landing and the dog sat without being asked and lifted a paw like a gentleman. Eddie shook it, solemn as a priest, and went out into the cold that had decided to be festive rather than cruel. Cloud hung low over the city as if listening. The Minster rose like someone taking a breath to sing. He went to meet it, and his knee twinged once to remind him he had a body and then settled, and the day opened like a door on good hinges.Chapter 9\n\nBy late afternoon the Minster had the look of a creature waking, lights rising through its ribs, voices gathering like knit stitches. Eddie stepped through the side door with his knee telling him its opinion in a language he could respect and ignore. The stone had its own breath, cool and intelligent, and the first thing it did was make you quiet even when you had come prepared to be loud. He stood just inside, letting the air settle his jacket on his shoulders, and felt the strange, sure clicking-in that sometimes visited him in certain rooms; the sense that his insides and the architecture had agreed a tempo.\n\nThe Canon met him under an arch that had never learned to be impressed by people and shook his hand with relief disguised as formality. \u201cYou look like a man who wrestled a dog and won,\u201d she said, eyes flicking to the protective arc of his body and the way he guarded the knee without fuss.\n\n\u201cJust a small game of traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe called it a draw.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod favours fools and dog-walkers,\u201d she said. \u201cCome, your tribe is assembling.\u201d\n\nThey were, all shapes and ages, gathered in the nave like a rumour that had gone right. The community choir stood in a loose herd near the front, coats half off, pride sat shy in the corner of mouths. A teenager with a silver hoop through one eyebrow tapped a folded piece of paper against her knee in time with a beat only she could hear. A man who looked as if he could fix a tractor hung back by a pillar and watched the others commit to the idea of being seen. Two women who might have been sisters if not in blood then in the way they shifted weight in the same rhythm whispered and nodded, a duet without sound. Eddie looked at them and felt that old, campus peace: I can make this better for a minute, and that will be enough.\n\nHe began as he always did, not with notes but with breath. He made them laugh on purpose first because laughter opens throats without asking permission. He talked about the body as a bell and the ground as the clapper and made a fool of himself once so that no one else had to. When he made them put their hands on their own stomachs he did it too, and when his knee wobbled on the second stance he let it wobble in public and made a joke about aging as if it were a far-off rumour instead of yesterday. The Minster bent its listening down to them; the sort of acoustics that don\u2019t flatter so much as keep you honest, returning exactly what you give but warmer.\n\nThey ran through the carols that had come with the letters of the year tucked in their folds. There was the one that made the older men look briefly like boys in blazers, staring at the floor as if it had answers. There was the one that allowed the altos to be secretly magnificent. There was the one with the sudden, sneaky key change that, if mishandled, could spill you into embarrassment, and when it came he showed them how to step into it sideways rather than leap. When the organist arrived and flicked the instrument awake, the sound puffed through the building like a memory, and even the teenager with the hoop stopped pretending to be bored.\n\nBetween requests from the Canon and nods from the organ loft, Eddie took his place at the little lectern where his name had been printed in a font that suggested the church had opinions about fonts. He made himself look up, not at the great window that had bullied better men into believing, but at the faces. School faces half-hidden behind pillar and parent, Mrs Pennington in a sensibly warm coat with the look of a woman allowing herself to enjoy a thing she had already catalogued, Jules perched at the end of a pew like a punctuation mark, wearing a tie with snowmen that managed to be both ironic and sincere. In the back, next to a stone knight who had been receiving visitors with patience for five centuries, his father stood with his hands flat on the top of the pew in front like he was bracing a workbench. Their eyes didn\u2019t meet because there are rules, old and kind. It was enough that the hat was off and the body present.\n\nRehearsal gave way to service the way afternoon gives way to evening, the light lowering its voice without feeling the need to explain. People came in with cheeks made red by the city\u2019s particular cold, with scarves that carried conversation. Children were coaxed into pews and promised oranges later by parents who knew the power of fruit with added ribbon. A boy in an oversized jumper announced in a hush that there were real candles, as if the Minster had finally earned his respect by becoming dangerous. Eddie stood to the side as the first words were said by a voice made for wood and listened as if the sentences could change the arrangement of his molecules.\n\nHis solo sat midway through, a song chosen because it had the weight he trusted and because he had once heard his mother sing the first line into a steam-silvered kitchen and then laugh at herself. He waited for his cue with his hand on the reading desk in a small habit he had stolen from priests. When it came, he walked to the place where the lectern spilled out into air and stopped before the invisible line that some version of himself had once insisted upon. The dream he had had the night before flickered in his body like a suggestion from an old friend. He looked down at the stone and then up into the soft, collective face of his city and its visitors and he moved his foot half an inch forward, not dramatic, not rebellious, just a human stepping into the shape that fit.\n\nHe sang the first phrase like he was opening a careful package in a room that contained breakables. The stone gave it back to him like a story told to an older relative you love, edited for kindness. He hit the breath at the place he had learned to in the school hall and the note laid itself along the columns and around the heads of people who had come to be forgiven for something small. He did not think of telly or of judgements or of cameras that do adding and subtracting at the same time. He thought of tea towels and recorders and towels draped over radiators like small defeated flags. He thought of a boy in Year 1 telling him not to fall off. He thought of his father\u2019s hands, square and capable, laid on a pew as if steadying a table before you saw to the screws. He sang and let the end show its little, honest crack, not as a party trick but as a finger pointing to the place where breath and truth shook hands and both went home slightly changed.\n\nIt was not the kind of applause you get on television with hands ready and camera red lights hunting for stories. It was the quiet ripple that happens in a holy place when people feel they should not add noise but cannot not say thank you. There was the shift of bodies, the collective sigh, the clearing of throats, little noises that are an admission. The Canon nodded once, small and complete. The teenager with the hoop raised her eyebrows at him with a generosity that did not have to commit to language. In the back his father moved his jaw and looked away and then back, the way people do when they have missed a bit of life and are trying to catch it up without running.\n\nThe choir did their brave work and the children's voices came up like odd birds, off in places, perfect in others, never untrue. At the end, when the last candle in its little army guttered and rallied and then gave up politely, the smell of wax and wool and December took the building by its old hand and walked it towards goodnight. People did the shuffle that means happiness has to get back to its car before the meter runs out. Eddie shook hands and accepted thanks like biscuits you must eat even if you are full, and then did the corner-of-the-eye meeting with those who did not want too much fuss. He saw students pretending not to be gleeful when their teacher\u2019s voice had done a nice thing and he saw Mrs Pennington tell a parent with calm ferocity that their child could, if desired, join the recorder club without expectation of exceptional talent.\n\nHe found his father near a pillar pretending to examine the carving of a bishop\u2019s foot. They nodded at each other because hugging seemed like a thing for another church or a future life. \u201cGood lungs,\u201d his father said, which had become both a joke and a sacrament between them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go flat on the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a woman in a sensible coat warn me against it in October,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI obeyed.\u201d\n\nHis father looked at the ceiling in a way that passed for awe and then back at his son\u2019s face that now escaped his best efforts not to look at it. \u201cYour mother would have\u2014\u201d he began, and stopped there because they both knew all the endings to that sentence and adding one would be like placing an extra chair at a table that already had enough legs.\n\n\u201cWe owe her a brew,\u201d Eddie said, and the little smile that appeared on the old man\u2019s face was the exact shade of his own when he had a dumb idea that felt right.\n\nThe night was the kind that made the city sound travel in clean lines. Outside, the Christmas market had dimmed to its last sugars and the stalls were packing up with a familiar clatter. Jules found them in the shadow of the Minster and handed Eddie a paper bag that warmed his glove; gingerbread in the shape of a star with a face, smile iced on with the confidence of someone who believed in the power of frosting. \u201cYou stole a bit,\u201d Jules said, meaning the evening, not the biscuit. \u201cYou thief. I\u2019m looking to report a theft of time and breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were conspicuously damp-eyed for a cynic,\u201d Eddie said, biting the point of the star and feeling it crumble in a way that satisfied something tidy in him.\n\n\u201cI am an emotional laundrette,\u201d Jules said, shoving his hands deep in his pockets because he had misjudged his coat. \u201cThe spin cycle was fierce. Also your father stood up at the good bit like he\u2019d been told to by fifty years of something and then pretended he was stretching. I nearly had to be mopped.\u201d\n\nEddie looked down the street where a fox threaded between groups as if it had tickets. He felt the slight pulse in his knee and the bigger, stranger pulse under his sternum that had nothing to do with exertion and everything to do with relief. Maya appeared with a hat on that made her look like a poem and Pickle in a sensible coat he pretended to hate. The dog, who had survived a small argument with destiny, sat without being asked and lifted a paw with the solemnity of a judge. Eddie shook it, and the dog leaned on his shin as if staking a claim and offering stability.\n\n\u201cI am never letting him off the lead again,\u201d Maya said, while clipping and unclipping like a person who learns by repeating. \u201cExcept I am, because he deserves to be a person at a field. I\u2019m trying to be someone who doesn\u2019t live entirely in fear and also I\u2019m buying a better clip.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will cultivate caution that looks like grace,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cIt\u2019ll suit us. How\u2019s the dissertation?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn organism,\u201d she said. \u201cIt eats hours and produces vague pride. It will be submitted and then I will have to invent new ways to be disciplined because the world refuses to put tape on the floor. You were good, by the way. My mum cried and my dad blamed onions and we don\u2019t own onions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send them a bag,\u201d he said. \u201cWith instructions.\u201d\n\nThey walked, because walking is one of the better ways to keep a good night from tipping out too fast. The Minster receded as if it were ducking behind a tree for a minute and would pop out later to pick up a conversation. The streets knew them and their feet knew the seams in the stone. People nodded without invading, which is one of the local arts. A man with a hat that did not suit him tried to sell them something that had started life as a candle and changed its mind, and Jules bought it because he is an idiot for things that flicker and the man smiled with all his teeth like it was Christmas at last.\n\nBack at the flats, the hallway smelled of those incense sticks the woman in 1A burned when her boyfriend stayed over, as if she were instructing the air to be civilised. Tom\u2019s door had post tucked behind the handle and the sound of nothing behind it. Maya took a deep breath that put steadiness into the corridor. Eddie bent to untie his shoes and the knee did its objection and then backed out of the argument; it would be fine in the morning if he didn\u2019t do stairs like a foal. He took the suit jacket off carefully and hung it in the way of someone who had learned to respect fabric because fabric had made him feel like a different version of himself and deserved reciprocity.\n\nThe green biscuit tin waited on its shelf without sentiment, and he opened it to slide in the programme from the service, the paper having collected a small thumb smudge of wax that made it feel like it belonged on the shelf rather than in a shoebox. He didn\u2019t take out the golden card, not because he didn\u2019t think about it but because that night had taught him that some brightnesses fade well and some you have to turn away from so you can see another kind. He put the lid on and the tin did its little sigh, a domestic amen.\n\nSleep came like a coat put on wrong and then adjusted. He dreamt he was in the school hall and the tape at the floor had been peeled up by a child for reasons of curiosity and he asked where it had gone and a voice he could not place said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need it, love,\u201d and he woke without the little panic that usually arrives when something is missing. He lay and listened to the building do its pipes song and felt the immediate, sweet tiredness of the well-used. The Christmas service sat in him like a heavy, pleasant book closed neatly and returned to the shelf.\n\nIn the morning he did the breakfast of a man who remembers he has a body and can\u2019t always treat it like an afterthought. He made himself porridge because oats are both economy and wisdom and put honey on because he had earned sweetness and because it went well with the Minster\u2019s echo still wandering around his ribs. The phone sat under its tea towel like a bird with no need to sing and he left it there, not in sacrifice but in choice. Outside, the city began another day with buses pretending to be patient and the river doing its loyally slow thing. He tucked his scarf in properly and headed for school with the particular pleasure of a person returning to his tools.\n\nThe hall waited, the tape absent and not missed. He stood anyway where he stood, out of habit and love, and sang one line into the empty morning because empty rooms are greedy and the song does not mind being shared with plaster and ancient chewing gum. The building accepted his offering and gave him back the familiar small echo that said, carry on. He checked the toilets, the Year 3s\u2019 flushes doing their shy squeal, and patted the cistern like a horse that responds to kindness better than to kicks. He moved chairs in sevens, the number still pleasing for reasons he could no longer explain, and then went to find Jules to tell him a very long story about very short candles.\n\nBetween Carol service and January, the adverts man phoned twice and left messages that used the word leverage as if it were a spice. Eddie listened to the first one and left the second to sit as a reminder that he was choosing. He met the studio man above the bakery and listened to mixes while steam rose off morning buns like souls. They talked about whether to put the Minster song on the record as a live track and decided not to, not because it wasn\u2019t good but because it was a moment and moments should sometimes keep their own dates. He went to his father\u2019s house on a Tuesday again and found the lawn under frost like a sheet with patterns and the hedge dignified by the cold and the kettle clicked into life as if the house were pleased to see him.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve he didn\u2019t go anywhere that required confetti. He went to the King\u2019s Arms for an hour and sang a song that wasn\u2019t seasonal and told the room that the song didn\u2019t know or care about dates and none of them argued. He went home early with Jules, both carrying paper bags like respectable men in a comedy sketch, and they ate sausage rolls at the table while listening to the city attempt to be excited about fireworks in the damp. At midnight, when the flats all did their variable versions of celebration\u2014one shout, two bangs, a woo from down the road, a fox\u2019s opinion\u2014he made the small wish of a person who has learned to distrust big ones. He wished for the continued ability to be of use. He added, privately, a wish from his mother that she would have wanted to see him add even if she didn\u2019t believe in wishing: let me step a little further out, without falling off.\n\nJanuary came in work boots and Eddie put his head down and carried, because that is how you survive the month that pretends to be improvement and often turns out to be endurance. The children returned with stories of grandparents and selection boxes and negotiations with screen time and he listened like a man being entrusted with the keys to small countries. He drew a snowman on the staffroom board and refused to let anyone erase it until March. He said yes to the hospice again, and no to the soap, and yes to a school in a village with a hall that smelled like mice and old panto wigs and taught a group of ten-year-olds that their bodies were trumpets whether or not they\u2019d ever want to use the metaphor in public.\n\nOn a Thursday afternoon, halfway through taking down a display of snowflakes that were never as pretty on paper as they had been in imagination, he received a letter in an envelope with confident corners. It was from the council, asking him if he would consider being part of a small project to record local songs and voices for an archive, to be listened to by people not yet born who might want to know what it sounded like here when people had accents like rivers and postcodes like statements. He stood in the corridor and read it twice and the second time he thought of his mother\u2019s laugh and his father\u2019s \u201cgood lungs\u201d and Jules\u2019 \u201cI gravy you\u201d and Maya\u2019s \u201cI am a plate with a chip\u201d and Mrs Pennington\u2019s \u201cnot during a fire drill\u201d and the little Year 1 who had saved him from falling off. He thought of Pickle\u2019s bark and the sound the hall made when you sang to it while it was empty. He thought of the Minster taking his note and lending it to the ceiling. He folded the letter like a precious thing and put it in the pocket where he kept mints and vows.\n\nOn the way home he clipped the lead to Pickle\u2019s collar himself, not for lack of trust in Maya who had mastered the art with a competence that made him proud, but because his hand wanted to feel the solid click and because the sound of it made a small, good line in his day. The dog waited, sat, lifted a paw, and Eddie shook it with all the solemnity such rituals deserve. They took the long route towards the river, avoiding the place where cars scythed in a hurry, learning together that you can choose safer and still find adventure. The city did the January thing of failing to commit to weather and he loved it for its indecision. He hummed something that had been a carol once and would be a lullaby now, and the dog looked back with a soft question that he answered with a whistle. The water slid by like someone doing their best without making a song and dance about it. He thought about the tape on the hall floor that wasn\u2019t there anymore and the line he had carried inside himself and how it had moved without anyone else\u2019s permission except his.\n\nHe went home and wrote a list because lists are how he convinces himself that life can be arranged. The tops of the list were sensible: new mop head, PAT test dates, ask Mrs P about budget for paint. The middle items were honest: visit Dad on Tuesday, no to adverts for a bit, ring Lorna and tell her about the Minster because she will want to know even though it\u2019s not her show. The bottom was foolish as all the best bits of lists are: keep the hall open late on Fridays once a month and let people sing if they want, call it something that sounds like a warm biscuit, maybe charge a pound for tea to stop them feeling guilty. He circled the foolish bit because sometimes circling is the first step in telling yourself you mean it.\n\nThat night, when he lay down, he felt the fatigue of someone who had carried the right things. He could feel in his bones the shape of the Minster, the curve of the school hall, the width of the corridor where the dog ran and didn\u2019t die, the length of the bus to his father\u2019s kitchen. He closed his eyes on a world that, if you looked at it on a map, would seem small, but which, lived properly, had the complexity of orchestras and plumbing. He slept, and dreamed, and in the dream there was music and there was tape and there were chairs in sevens, and there was the sound he had been making since he was a boy and didn\u2019t know what to call it, and for once he let it be without pushing it into usefulness. In the morning he would get up and make porridge and check flushes and carry chairs and answer questions and say no and say yes and put his hand on a dog\u2019s head and sing a line to a room made of varnish and good intentions. He would step forward when the room asked him to and step back when it needed him to listen. He would keep his lungs ready. He would tidy as he went. He would make, in the small place he had been blessed with, a sound that ran around the room and came back to where he stood.",

                              "content": "Before dawn, the corridors sang for him. It wasn\u2019t anything out loud, just the whisper of mop water sluicing over varnished treads, the soft squeak of rubber on polished oak, and the faint hum lodged in Eddie Garside\u2019s throat. He tiptoed past the Year 2 cloaks\u2014army of tiny coats and dangling gym bags\u2014towards the assembly hall, where the stage was a table on trestles and the curtains were a pair of heavy brown drapes that smelled faintly of dust and something older.\n\nHe stood at the line of tape he\u2019d measured out himself, the one he told the children was the \u201csafe zone\u201d so they wouldn\u2019t fall off the front. The hall was empty and echoey in the way of places that have been full of noise all day. Eddie propped the mop against a radiator, imaginary crowd before him, and sang two bars of a song his mum used to hum when she washed up.\n\nA drop of water plopped onto the parquet.\n\n\u201cMr Garside,\u201d said the faint, startled voice of Mrs Pennington behind him. \u201cWe don\u2019t sing while the floor\u2019s wet!\u201d\n\nEddie jumped, then grinned, mop back in his hands like nothing had happened. \u201cIt was a soft sing, Miss. A whisper sing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s slippery,\u201d she said, but there was no heat in it. She was the headteacher and wore shoes polite enough to tap like a mouse. The silver chain around her neck caught the light from the high windows. \u201cAnd if you\u2019re going to hum, hum in the corridors where no one falls and sues.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Miss,\u201d he said. When she was gone, he sang one more line under his breath so small it could have been the pipes clicking into life.\n\nA caretaker\u2019s day is a list. Bleach the loos, check the playground, hoover the staff room crumbs from the sofa where someone always had eaten something spicy and regretted it. Replace the notice board pin tacked with \u201cWe raised \u00a3278.31 for the NSPCC!\u201d with \u201cRemember your trip money!\u201d with \u201cNo Nut Wednesday!\u201d until the edges of the blue sugar paper frayed like hair. He fixed wobbly chair legs with his little metal kit. He carried boxes of paper a ream at a time and his wrists said sixty in the morning and thirty by tea.\n\nBut in the empty hall, with its cut-out paper snowflakes yellowing along the windows because no one had changed the display since December, he sang. He recorded himself on his phone, an old one with a defiant crack across the back like a grin. He kept his recordings in a folder called \u201cWork Stuff\u201d no one ever opened.\n\n\u201cYou should be on the telly,\u201d said Jules from the reprographics room when Eddie shuffled in with a trolley full of paper and jam tarts. Jules was wearing his usual slogan jumper: I gravy you. He had a soft face and twinkly eyes and a way of looking at Eddie as if he was something fragile. He was also the only person who came to Eddie\u2019s open mic nights just to clap no matter what.\n\n\u201cTelly?\u201d Eddie pretended to be outraged, hand on chest, lab coat flapping open over his old polo. \u201cThat where the criminals go!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe criminals of taste,\u201d said Jules. \u201cThe warlords of warbling.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot warble. Belt,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI\u2019ve got belt. And some falsetto with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t I know it,\u201d said Jules. \u201cThere\u2019s a hole in the photocopier that whistles same time you hit that top F.\u201d\n\nOn the way home the city threw its old stones at him, in that affectionate way York has. You could fall over the walls almost. The Minster shoulders hunched against the sky like a gentle giant. The Ouse shining brown and a little sullen. Dog walkers going fast because rain had fizzed in the air all afternoon and finally thought better of it. Eddie cut down past The Shambles, where the tourists came in clumps, even in February, even with the cold that bit through a coat like a mouse through a biscuit. He had a route. He always had a route, otherwise he\u2019d lose himself in the day.\n\nIn the little flat above Mrs Khanna\u2019s newsagents, he kicked off his boots by the door, one then the other, heel, toe, heel, toe, a ritual. Someone had pushed a menu for a new pizza place under his mat. Someone had also left a wet patch which meant Maya from 2B had been out with the puppy. The puppy: chunk of bone and fluff and temper and some impossible ratio of charm to fury. Pickle, it was called. Pickle with the teeth like tiny white commas. Pickle with eyes that said What now? What now? What now?\n\n\u201cEvening, Ed,\u201d said Maya when he was fishing his keys from that pocket nothing regular ever stays in. She stood there with the puppy straining against its lead, front paws off the ground, back paws scrabbling to run, enormous ears standing out like satellite dishes.\n\n\u201cAlright, Maya. He\u2019s on one.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always on one. Say hello, Pickle. Nicely,\u201d Maya said, and Pickle lunged, a small, determined cannonball. He almost took a stitch of Eddie\u2019s trouser. He almost tasted victory. \u201cOi!\u201d Maya yanked him back. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d Eddie said, which was true and also not. The dog liked him very much in the way toddlers like pushing a block over and over. The dog saw him and went \u201cThis is the man I chew.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s teething,\u201d said Maya. \u201cAnd you move funny.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a, you know, you sort of bop.\u201d\n\n\u201cBop?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike you\u2019ve got a song under your feet.\u201d\n\nHe smiled and did a tiny twirl to make her laugh, which she did, a bark almost like the dog\u2019s if you didn\u2019t know better. She was finishing a masters in something he couldn\u2019t remember the title of. She was always tired and clever and kind in a way that made Eddie stand up straighter. Her boyfriend, Tom, was nice in a bigger, looser way, and left his bike against the railings so it rattled every time anyone touched it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll get you one day,\u201d Eddie said to Pickle as he slipped into his flat. He didn\u2019t mean catch. He meant get like understand. He meant we\u2019ll shake hands.\n\nInside, he had a shelf of mugs from charity shops, each with a different cat printed on, even though he didn\u2019t like cats particularly, not in life; in ceramic form he loved them. He boiled the kettle. The window over the sink looked out onto the back alley where bins lived and foxes sometimes made a sound like they\u2019d phoned their mother and got bad news.\n\nHe sat at the little pine table he\u2019d sanded down himself and peered at the envelope on it. He\u2019d found it last night pushed halfway under his door, the way the kids pushed school letters under the staffroom door on their way past, as if paper wanted to be posted but didn\u2019t quite have the courage. The envelope was cream, the nice kind. His name on it, written with a bold felt-tip that wanted to be brush calligraphy and wasn\u2019t.\n\nHis hands were clean but his fingertips had little dry cracks from bleach, from winter, from years. He slid a finger under the flap and opened it carefully.\n\nInside was a letter on thick card. The letters were fat and gold. They shouted. They looked like they belonged on the telly. He barely breathed.\n\nWe are extremely delighted to offer you, E. Garside, a place\u2014\n\nHis heart did a little Irish bend at the E. He wasn\u2019t Irish. Someone, long back, had been. He\u2019d been told that at weddings by a cousin with a sharp chin and a dark laugh. E. Garside, he read again, and it looked right. It looked official. It looked like himself on paper.\n\n\u2014a place in the live final of this year\u2019s X Factor.\n\nHe put the card down, carefully, because his hands were shaking. He picked it back up, just to see if the letters were still there, if they\u2019d jump like fish. They were.\n\nHe had auditioned, hadn\u2019t he? He had, in a sense. Leeds Civic Hall, three months ago. He\u2019d queued in the kind of weather that likes to shuffle you around like a deck of cards. He\u2019d sung to a lad in a polo with a clipboard who had filmed him on an iPad and said, \u201cSweet, you\u2019ll get an e-mail.\u201d He had not seen the e-mail. He\u2019d checked his spam and his spam\u2019s spam. He had considered that he\u2019d put down the wrong address or that he didn\u2019t have the kind of face that gets e-mails.\n\nDelighted, he thought. Delighted was a word you could hold. He stood and did a small circle around his table, then a bigger one. He put the kettle on again because he\u2019d forgotten and then he forgot he\u2019d forgotten and boiled it once more. He took the letter over to the shelf and slotted it into the green biscuit tin where he kept the things he didn\u2019t want to look at too much in case they wore out, like winter gloves and old postcards from Blackpool and a photograph of him and his mum at Whitby, him with a lolly the size of his head. The tin sighed closed. The room buzzed.\n\nHe took it back out again. He had to show someone. Who?\n\nHis thumb hovered over his sister\u2019s name. Moira had two children and a husband who collected old bus tickets as if they were valuable fossils. She had a sigh that began in her shoes and travelled up through her bones. She loved him almost more than she could stand sometimes, and her love came packaged with advice. If he told her now, before it was on telly, would it unlock that sigh? Would it make it real?\n\nHe called Jules instead.\n\n\u201cJules of the printer,\u201d he said, too brightly. \u201cYou free?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor once, yes. I am merely a man in a room eating rice crackers in a T-shirt that says UNLEARN TO RELEARN. Why?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got news,\u201d Eddie said. The word latched itself to his tongue. News. He imagined the old newsagents till ringing with it.\n\n\u201cTell me it\u2019s a date with Warwick Davis,\u201d said Jules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s bigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God, you\u2019ve finally got your bus pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cLive bigger.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause, a hum. \u201cYou haven\u2019t\u2026 Ed? Not\u2026?\u201d\n\nHe couldn\u2019t hang the sentence on anything delicate. He had to put it out there and step back. \u201cFinals,\u201d he said. \u201cOf the X-Factor. I\u2019ve only gone and made it to the finals.\u201d\n\nJules didn\u2019t speak for a heartbeat. Eddie could hear the little click of Jules\u2019 jaw as he closed and opened his mouth, the way you can when someone is about to clap but isn\u2019t sure how loud to be.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d Jules said at last, wonderingly. \u201cYou\u2019re joking.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. Golden letters. Official as a bus timetable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming over,\u201d said Jules, and the phone line filled with his rushing. Eddie put the kettle on again, then realised he\u2019d never actually poured it and his kitchen had the far-away shininess of someone who moves too fast. He washed three mugs, just in case.\n\nWhen Jules came up the stairs, Pickle hurled himself at Jules\u2019 shins in a paroxysm of opinion. \u201cBetter him than me,\u201d Eddie said from his doorway.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re on the telly? You\u2019re on the telly?\u201d Jules said by way of hello, sounding exactly like the small children who spotted a local weatherman in the supermarket. His eyes were wet. That moved Eddie, because Jules used his tears wisely. He hugged him, sudden. Jules smelled of jam and a faint metallic undertone of ink, which was his smell always, but now it meant something else. It meant here is the first person who believes me.\n\nHe showed him the card and they read it together like a prayer. The card said there would be rehearsals. It said names of people Eddie had watched on TV on the sofa with a blanket and toast, people who had sat behind desks and made faces that were not cruel exactly but interested in the ways people could fail. It said a date. It said London. It was a leap. It was a fire.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going,\u201d said Jules. \u201cTell me you\u2019re going.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill Mrs Pennington give me the days?\u201d he said, immediately stupid. He could feel himself putting a barrier between this and himself because he didn\u2019t want to smash into it and break his teeth. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the governors in. We\u2019ve got the junior production of Alice. We\u2019ve got\u2026I mean. There\u2019s glue to buy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Mrs Pennington can\u2019t spare one caretaker, Mrs Pennington can clean the loos herself,\u201d said Jules. \u201cTell her you\u2019ve got an opportunity. Tell her the city of York demands its champion sing.\u201d\n\nChampion. He was an old man suddenly with a cape. He snorted. \u201cChampion what? Mop-wielding.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeart-mending,\u201d said Jules. \u201cTea-making. You\u2019ll be yourself, Eddie, and that\u2019s the point.\u201d\n\nThey ate toast, a second dinner, because news used up sugar. When Jules had gone, Eddie put the card away again and then\u2014unable to help himself\u2014took it out for the third time, like it might vanish if he didn\u2019t keep an eye on it. He read his name. He was there. He was going.\n\nAt work, he felt taller. He tidied the assembly chairs in sets of seven, the way the school liked, but he did it with a little roll of his shoulders as if he was already on stage. The children were a wave of small humans that hit him and receded and left debris\u2014stickers, sand, a sense of warmth. One of the Year 6 girls, Mia, said, \u201cSir, why are you smiling like that?\u201d and he said, \u201cBecause someone gave me good news and good news is a jumper you don\u2019t want to take off yet,\u201d and she rolled her eyes with a tweenager\u2019s grace and said, \u201cWhatever.\u201d\n\nAt break, he cornered Mrs Pennington in her office, where potted plants went to live forever if they behaved. He stood in front of her desk and tried to arrange his face into the respectful shape. He had the envelope in his hand, because he couldn\u2019t not.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an opportunity\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it the boiler again?\u201d she said, automatically, her eyes flicking to the blue folder where the gas men\u2019s numbers lived.\n\n\u201cNo, Miss. A different sort. A performing sort.\u201d\n\nShe looked up then, properly. She had known him since he\u2019d started, nine years ago, when his hair had done something jaunty and now did something honest. She had been the one to say, \u201cYour voice is nice at assemblies, but perhaps not during a fire drill,\u201d which had been fair.\n\n\u201cA performing sort,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made the final. X Factor.\u201d\n\nThere was a time when people used to say that show in capital letters even when they were making fun. Now they said it with the mild smile of someone remembering they\u2019d liked a sweet that had gone out of fashion. Mrs Pennington did not laugh. She glanced at the envelope that he held like a passport. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026Ed, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014yes,\u201d he said, unable to find the noun.\n\n\u201cAnd you need time off.\u201d\n\n\u201cA little. I\u2019ll catch up on what I can. Night work, if you want. I can do nights.\u201d\n\nShe did not say no. She did that head tilt that meant she was making a list of cons and pros and making it look like listening. \u201cYou love this school,\u201d she said, instead.\n\nHe put his hand on the back of the cracked chair he was not allowed to sit on, because no one sat in the headteacher\u2019s office even if she\u2019d invited them to. \u201cI do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love those children.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do. They\u2019re a chorus, on a good day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she said. \u201cBring me the dates. Put it in writing. We\u2019ll paperclip it to the governor\u2019s file so I can show them a paperclip. That is the extent of my power.\u201d\n\nHe laughed and thanked her and left before she could mind. He felt fizzy. The days bunched and fluttered like washing.\n\nHe told Moira on Sunday. She\u2019d invited him for a roast and he ate three roast potatoes more than anyone else because he had a stomach that could put away grief and joy and spuds all in the same slot. The kids ran around the table and under it. The dog\u2014Moira\u2019s old Labrador, gentle and greying, sleeping with one eye open\u2014thumped his tail like he approved of the conversation even asleep.\n\n\u201cYou are joking,\u201d said Moira, hands on hips. \u201cEd.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cEd.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe telly,\u201d he said, and he did a stupid little dance because sometimes with Moira you had to deflate your own balloon or she\u2019d do it for you. He showed her the card. She read it as if she was checking someone\u2019s spellings. She put it down and picked it up once more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll come,\u201d she said at last, that alarmed love in her voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll wave. We\u2019ll cry. I\u2019ll wear mascara that doesn\u2019t move in wind.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to cry,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI cry at adverts. I cried at that advert with the boy who gets a hamster and the hamster teaches him about climate,\u201d she said. \u201cI cried at a leaflet about hearing aids.\u201d\n\nHe told her he\u2019d call when he had the day. He told her he was fine. He told her\u2014unwise\u2014that he could do this. She hugged him in a way that put his whole head under her chin and made him feel thirty and also ten.\n\nThat night, he couldn\u2019t sleep. The wind did that whistle up the alley between the flats. He sat up in bed and thought about the minute he would walk across the stage. About the lights coming up from under his feet. About the shape of his hands, the exact angle he should put them so he didn\u2019t look like he was holding oranges.\n\nHe dreamed that the stage was a playground and he had to climb a rope and there was a dog at the top of the rope with eyes like black coins, waiting to see if he made it, tongue lolling, but not unkind. He woke with the certainty that the dog was a person with an opinion and that he must win him.\n\nThough he had not told many people, York is a small kind of big. The Polish man at the bakery said, \u201cYou will sing,\u201d as if someone had told him at the till. The lady at the post office asked for an autograph for her niece and then said, charmingly, \u201cYou can just sign it Tom Jones if you like; she can\u2019t read yet.\u201d\n\nHe made a list of songs on the back of a cereal box. He would not do the song everybody did. He would do the song that came back to him in the supermarket when he was choosing carrots. He would do something from the heart that didn\u2019t sound like kindness, because too much kindness is boring on telly; he\u2019d watched enough to know. He\u2019d sing something that had the crack of something true. He wrote \u201cHurt\u201d and then crossed it out because the last time he\u2019d tried that he\u2019d stood too close to the speakers and his ear had rung for two days as if a tiny bell had moved in. He wrote \u201cRun\u201d and then wrote \u201cNo.\u201d He wrote \u201cThe First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\u201d and looked at it for a long time and put a little star next to it because it had a big breath right in the middle and he knew where to put it.\n\nHe asked Jules if he\u2019d listen to practice. Jules said, \u201cYes, and also move that chair to your left because you look like you\u2019re waiting at a bus stop in a scandal.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of all this, Pickle grew. Puppies do that thing where you think you\u2019ve learned the volume of them and then they add an extra bit from nowhere. Pickle got longer. His legs turned from billiards to chopsticks. His eyes went from baby to teenage boy. He learned to sit and not to stay. He learned to paw and immediately forget the usefulness of paw.\n\nOne dawn, Eddie came down the narrow stairs, keys in his teeth because his hands were full of a crate of cleaning supplies. Pickle was outside the door of 2B, lead on but not attached because Tom thought shortcuts were faster than the seconds it took to do something properly. The dog spotted Eddie, let out a noise like a tiny horn, and went for his laces. In the balance, in the dance, Eddie stumbled and the crate tipped. Plastic bottles of wash fell and rolled. The one marked DEGREASER cracked its cap. A smell of orange and cloud tables rose and fell in the hallway.\n\n\u201cPickle!\u201d Eddie said, laughing and angry, those two brothers that look the same around the eyes.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a feisty little bugger,\u201d Tom said, coming out in socks, one-hand texting, one-hand useless. \u201cGood boy, Pick! Go on, get him. Defend the realm.\u201d\n\nEddie stared at him because the thing that hurts more than a dog is a man who thinks the dog is funny from five feet away. \u201cPlease keep him in,\u201d he said, quietly. \u201cHe near had me down the stairs.\u201d\n\nTom smiled a smile that said football on TV and job not lovely but pays and girlfriend who rolls her eyes in jokes. \u201cHe\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not fine. He\u2019s a baby with knives.\u201d\n\nTom made a joke about that, and Eddie put his crate down and looked at Pickle, who panted, who broke into a sit like it was a sitcom and someone had shouted applause. The dog looked back with such untroubled want. Eddie crouched and the dog licked his fingers and the whole thing was ridiculous. This dog was fury and darling at once. This dog was York, and himself, and the show, and everything you love that might bite you.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he said into the fur. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll work it out.\u201d\n\nThe day the call came, he was in the caretaker\u2019s cupboard under the stairs, where mice used to be and now there were only old brooms and a smell of the 1970s. He had his phone on loud because his mind wasn\u2019t a sieve that day, for once. He looked at the screen and it said a number that wasn\u2019t York. A sharp, bright London number.\n\n\u201cHello?\u201d he said, and he knew he had swallowed his name in the middle like a pit. \u201cYes. Hi. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that Mr Garside?\u201d said a voice with professional cheer.\n\n\u201cIt is. Yes. Hello.\u201d His heart was a washboard.\n\n\u201cHi, it\u2019s Lorna from the X Factor team. Are you having a nice day? Great. So I\u2019m calling to confirm that you received your final-stage invitation and to go through travel and accommodation info.\u201d\n\nThe cupboard seemed to go smaller and bigger. He leaned his hand against the shelf. He imagined savouring the words again later like sucking the salt off a crisp. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, I did.\u201d\n\n\u201cFantastic. We\u2019ll need you in London on the Thursday before. We can arrange train tickets from\u2014let me check\u2014York?\u201d\n\n\u201cYork,\u201d he said, and the city hummed at its name in his ear.\n\n\u201cFantastic,\u201d said Lorna. \u201cI\u2019ll send you a link to a portal. If you could fill everything in by end of day? Brilliant. We look forward to seeing you. If you have any questions, call this number, but also we won\u2019t answer if we can\u2019t, so maybe e-mail. Have a nice day, Mr Garside.\u201d\n\nShe rang off, and Eddie stood in the cupboard for exactly thirteen seconds with his phone at his ear because he needed the dark to contain the voice. He came out blinking. The corridor looked ordinary, which was wrong. He wanted everything to have its shirt on backwards, to show that it knew.\n\nThat afternoon he walked past the Minster with a bag of potatoes and three onions because he\u2019d promised Moira he\u2019d make stew for when the kids came over on Wednesday. The bells spoke. They tell you you have a soul if one doesn\u2019t turn up on its own. He looked up. The sky was the perfect, thoughtless blue of nothing when you wanted something. People moved around him with supermarket bags, with tourists\u2019 cameras, with hats. He felt connected to all of them with a string that tugged once and then was still. Everyone looked like they were going somewhere important. He might be.\n\nBy the river, in the little wedge of garden where teenagers came to kiss and then pretend not to, there was a dog-walking class, five pups with their people, each pup prancing. Their tails stuck up like the aerials of remote-control cars. A woman with hair like a friendly storm called out, \u201cHeel! Heel!\u201d and an old collie watched from the side with the look of someone who once ran the country and now enjoyed retirement.\n\nEddie watched them with the expression he had when a choir hit a note good. It made his throat hot. It made him think of his mother again, of the way she had sung the end of songs too loud, as if she could finish them alone if she had to. He thought of his father briefly, as if he were a thread you could see on the back of embroidery but not on the front.\n\nHe went to The King\u2019s Arms that night to sing, because he needed to be heard by someone who didn\u2019t know him. The river lapped at the walls because it had been raining somewhere else. The pub leaned into itself the way old bricks do, warm, cramped. There was a woman at the front with a face like a map of roads leading home. There were two young men who were more hair than anything else. The barman was an old soldier. Eddie listened to a boy with a cheap Stratocaster who sang like a kettle nearly boiling. He listened to a girl who had the sort of voice that made you want to hand her a spare handkerchief every day of her life. He listened and was brave.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it going, folks?\u201d he said into the mic like he\u2019d always done. \u201cI\u2019m Ed, from St Olaf\u2019s school, and I\u2019m going to sing something old because my face is old and we belong together.\u201d\n\nThey laughed in that way that meant good. He sang. He chose the song he\u2019d chosen because the silence after the first line has to hold. He sang it and it held. It trembled like a bird in his palm and he did not squeeze. He let it be. He hit the big breath and it was fine. The woman with the road-map face put her fist on her chest like something had got free there.\n\nAfter, a man at the bar with a tie undone and a day on him said, \u201cYou should be on telly,\u201d and then laughed because that was the joke always. Eddie laughed too and said, \u201cRight?\u201d and both of them let it be.\n\nHe went home down the crooked streets and Pickle was in the hallway again because the hallway was a conveyor belt of people going somewhere else and the dog liked to observe traffic. Pickle barked once and then lay on his tummy, front paws under him, a little Sphinx. Eddie sat on the bottom stair and put his hand out. The dog put his paw on it like a handshake. Everything was ordinary and high.\n\nHe started to pack a bag without quite meaning to. Socks, the good ones. His best white shirt that wasn\u2019t very best. The black belt that made him feel like he had a shape. He put them in and took them out again because they looked lonely in the suitcase. He folded them with his hands that were rough and made them neat, which is the same as love.\n\nHe lay on his bed and watched the light from the street lamp draw a square on his ceiling and bleed away. He thought, foolishly, of what he would say if they asked him that telly question, that \u201cWhy now, why you?\u201d\n\nBecause I have carried things for a long time, he thought. Because I like people, and I like to hear them when they sing along, quietly, because it is a way to say the things you can\u2019t put on a form. Because I want my sister to have her cry and laugh and not worry about me for a five minutes. Because the world is loud with angry and soft with small kindnesses and something in between might be a song. Because of Mum, obviously. Because of Dad, too, a little. Because I want to see what the lights do to me.\n\nHe fell asleep with his mouth open and dreamed that the Minster was a microphone and all the city leaned in, listening, and what came out of him was not a note but something else entirely, a sound he didn\u2019t know and yet always had, like the way you can whistle by accident. He woke with his heart in a knot that wasn\u2019t unpleasant.\n\nIn the morning, his alarm didn\u2019t go off because he\u2019d turned it down instead of up because sometimes the world taps you on the heel when you\u2019re running. He made tea in a rush. He knocked over his favourite mug and it cracked and he told himself it was fine because cracks are stories.\n\nIn the stairwell, Pickle was there, of course he was, entire to his bone. He tugged at the lead and the lead slipped because Tom had used a clip that looked like it had been attached to a curtain one day. \u201cHold him a sec,\u201d Tom said, and let go without waiting to see if Eddie was holding. The puppy went and Eddie went and the stairs remember every fall they\u2019ve seen.\n\nThey didn\u2019t fall. Not that day. The dog hit the end of the lead and bounced back like a thought and Eddie grabbed the banister with his strong custodial hand and swore a soft, old-fashioned swear his mother would have liked to hear because it meant he was still the boy she\u2019d taught not to swear.\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Tom said, not sorry at all, his hair perfect, his shirt open at the throat in that way that looks like you\u2019ve been having a conversation with a fence. \u201cHe gets excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe could kill someone,\u201d Eddie said, and Tom laughed because he thought everything was a joke until it wasn\u2019t. Eddie patted the dog\u2019s head because it wasn\u2019t his fault, he was a baby with a motor attached. The dog licked him so hard his chin went wet.\n\nHe left with the taste of dog on his face and the card in his pocket in its envelope like a heart with edges.\n\nAt school, he scrubbed an art room table where someone had drawn a guinea pig so full of love it almost got up and squeaked. He filled a bucket. He checked the doors. He watched an assembly where the Year 3s performed a dance about the Vikings that was scarier than it meant to be. He hid his phone in the locker under his jacket as if it was something precious and bad. He told Jules that the portal had asked for his passport number and he\u2019d had to go to the drawer where he kept all the papers that were half-important and none of them had the right names. Jules said he would bring his scanner, which was like telling someone in the 1800s you had an extra horse.\n\nIn the tiny window of quiet between school and evening cleaners, he sang in the hall again. The light in there did that slow sweet thing, and motes went up like applause. He did the first line and stopped and did it again and the second time it came better. His feet felt steady on the wood. He looked at the tape on the floor that marked the no-fall zone and he stepped to it and not over it because he had this superstition now that as long as he didn\u2019t put his toe across he could keep his life from tripping. He didn\u2019t tell anyone because it sounded silly out loud. He nodded to the imaginary band. He took his breath.\n\n\u201cMr Garside!\u201d called a child from the far door. \u201cThe toilets are out of order!\u201d\n\nHe stopped and let the breath out in a laugh, which is also a song. He went to see. The toilets were not out of order; the boys had put a sign because they wanted the girl\u2019s toilets. He removed the sign and told them about fairness like somebody\u2019s grandad. He heard himself and thought, God, I am somebody\u2019s grandad to a whole building.\n\nAt home, he opened his portal on the computer he kept under a tea towel because dust had done a number on the last one. He typed. He filled in boxes. Name, address, emergency contact. He wrote Moira and then looked at it and underlined it as if that would make her more contactable. He pressed submit and a little spinning circle danced so long his tea went cold and he had to boil the kettle again because life is a kettle.\n\nLater, on the phone, Moira said, \u201cHave you got your suit? No? You have to get one. You can\u2019t go on telly in your school trousers, Ed. They\u2019ve got bleach on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tasteful bleach marks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s couture.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting a suit,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll take you. We\u2019ll go to that place near the station where the mannequins look like disappointed history teachers.\u201d\n\nThey went, and she stood behind him when he turned in the mirror, and he saw her face in the glass and his in it, both of them considering. He looked\u2026 like a version of himself he didn\u2019t know yet. The jacket was slightly too long in the arms and he liked it that way because it felt like the suit was still asking permission to be his. He bought a tie even though he didn\u2019t intend to wear it. He liked the idea of a tie. He put it in his bag and petted it like a pet snake.\n\nSometimes he thought of the letter and the call and it glowed, and sometimes he thought of it and a small black moth of fear flew up. What if he was the wrong man for this after all? What if he was the right man in the wrong weather? He kept those thoughts in a different compartment, the one where he kept the socks that didn\u2019t match and his letters from people who spelled his name TBA.\n\nOn Wednesday night, when Moira dropped the kids and their noise in his flat because she had a late shift in a little cafe that served coffee so strong it came with a waft of old heartbreak, Pickle slipped his lead in the hall again. He barreled into the kids and they squealed in the good way and the parents of Maya and Tom were away and Tom was doing a long shift and Maya sat on the stairs texting, chin in palm, light on her face. The dog saw Eddie. The dog, who was everyday a storm with pretty rain, put his paws up on Eddie\u2019s thighs and looked up as if to say, Hello. As if to say, Remember me. As if to say, I will cause you problems and also stories.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be famous,\u201d said Mia, Moira\u2019s eldest, when she scooped the dog and made a noise in his ears. \u201cYou\u2019ll be like that woman from Bake Off. People will stop you and ask if you\u2019re Greggs. Can we name the dog Greggs? I want a dog called Greggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s called Pickle,\u201d Maya said, smiling at last, looking at Eddie from under her fringe like she\u2019d finally seen him with her whole sight. \u201cAnd he is an arse.\u201d\n\n\u201cLanguage,\u201d said Eddie, automatically, then laughed at himself because he was not in school.\n\nThat night, he made stew, and the children ate it like a song. He sat by the window with his cup and watched the street be itself. He watched a fox run the length of the alley like a note on a line. He saw, just for a second, the reflection of himself in the glass, and behind him, faint, the stage, not the hall this time, the big one, with its lights and its problems, waiting. He put his hand up and almost touched it, like touching an aquarium, the fish impossibly near.\n\nIn the morning, he would get the next e-mail. He would write the next line on his list. He would take the leash from Maya\u2019s hand and walk the dog the long way round, because the long way round sometimes gets you somewhere you didn\u2019t think to go. He would make a breakfast that involved three eggs because nerves eat protein. He would rehearse the patter with Jules. He would check his passport four times.\n\nHe brushed his teeth and in the mirror he sang a quiet little warm-up into the foam and the foam made him look like a man who had eaten a small cloud. He laughed out loud because the sound bubble in him had to pop somewhere.\n\nHe went to bed and lay not still. He thought he heard clapping, but it was the radiator doing the thing it did when the metal moved and forgot to be quiet. He closed his eyes. He held the card in his mind like a coin you cannot spend. He said out loud into his pillow, just to hear it: \u201cE. Garside, live final.\u201d\n\nThe room listened as if it had ears. The city leaned in. The tiny dog in the hall upstairs turned three times and lay down like a person in an old story, one where animals talked and wagged and bit and came back for more. He slept, and the world was the same and not the same, and he was in it, shining, a little, like a man in a suit who had set his shoulders and forgotten, for a moment, how heavy they could be.",

                              "content": "The e-mail came with no fanfare, just a soft ping that might have been the fridge reconsidering itself. He\u2019d left the laptop open on the pine table and the tea towel he kept over it like a modesty cape slid onto the floor without fuss. He was mid-egg, his frying pan doing that convincing song that sounds like accomplishment, when he saw the subject line: CALL SHEET \u2013 FINAL WEEK ONE. He wiped his hands on the tea towel, picked it up and forgot to put it back down again as he clicked. There it all was, a week spooling out in boxes and bold: travel, arrival, wardrobe, \u201cVT\u201d which he\u2019d learned was a small lie because it wasn\u2019t videotape anymore, it was just a name that hung around long after the tapes had gone. It said Lorna\u2019s name. It said Wembley, which did something fizzy in his chest even though he knew they\u2019d filmed in other places before. It said: You will perform your selected song for staging at 10:20. It also said: Please bring any personal items that make you feel yourself. He laughed out loud at that and looked around his flat as if to ask the mugs and the biscuit tin and the socks which of them wanted to come to London and be themselves.\n\nHe put three eggs on a plate and thought about protein with the solemnity of a teenage boy who\u2019d picked a diet off the internet. He didn\u2019t have to be at school for an hour. He put on his jacket and the scarf that always smelled faintly like last autumn no matter how often he washed it, and he tapped on Maya\u2019s door because he\u2019d said he\u2019d walk Pickle while she was at a lecture and Tom was doing a shift that began at some time he called stupid. She opened, hair up in a bun that had promised not to move and was moving anyway, and the dog heard the word walk in whatever way dogs do when you haven\u2019t said it yet. He was all spring, straight out into the corridor on his short lead, paws scrabbling, doing that rolling wave with his spine that still said puppy even as his legs tried on their idea of adulthood.\n\nThey took the long way. They went past the launderette where the owner had a habit of watching dramas with the subtitles on and the sound off as if he was translating life for himself, past the closed-up caf\u00e9 that would try again at eleven, past the place with the chalkboard that always said different things in big hopeful loops and never said \u201csoup\u201d for reasons of pride. Pickle stopped at every lamppost and read it like news, quick sniffs, a frown, a wag. Eddie kept his wrist steady like the dog class woman had shown, not a yank and not a let, just a quiet insistence that they were going this way, thanks, and the dog looked up at him occasionally as if to agree that yes, fine, but did you see that leaf. They crossed the little bridge over the beck and Pickle put a paw in the water and made a face like betrayal and then put his paw in again because betrayal is an interesting flavour.\n\n\u201cYou going to be famous, then?\u201d Maya said, not looking, as if it were a small comment about weather. Her cheeks were pink with cold; the kind of cold that thinks it is far kinder than it is because the sun is out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be on the telly for a second,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then the telly will have other business.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy mum\u2019s already told the WhatsApp group. She told the dance mums and the dog mums, which are crossover but not the same,\u201d Maya said. \u201cTom told his lot at the depot. One of them said he saw you in the pub and you sang an Adele but not in a girl way, in a bloke way, which I think is his highest compliment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take it,\u201d he said. \u201cHow\u2019s Pickle\u2019s sit?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn and off,\u201d she said, and the dog sat then as if he\u2019d understood irony. \u201cI told Tom about the lead. He said he\u2019d look at a better clip and then he bought a gadget for his bike instead. He\u2019s not bad, he\u2019s just\u2026 Tom is Tom.\u201d\n\nThey walked past the Minster\u2019s far shoulder where the stone has its own weathered plans, and Eddie felt that old tug again, that string between his sternum and the city. He bent and gave Pickle a scratch behind the ear when he didn\u2019t lunge at a pigeon. The puppy\u2019s eyes rolled sideways to watch him, pleased in a way that was honest and new every time. It occurred to him as sudden and soft as a cough that he loved this idiot animal. He hadn\u2019t asked to; it had happened while he was looking at other things.\n\nAt school, the staffroom smelled of toasted bagels and photocopier heat. Jules raised both hands when Eddie came in, like a magician about to make a dove appear. \u201cWalked past a sweater in a shop,\u201d Jules said. \u201cIt said X FACTOR DAD. I feel robbed of an opportunity. Also, you\u2019ve got an eight a.m. fire door inspection with the business manager who thinks he\u2019s MI5.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had worse,\u201d Eddie said. He slid the e-mail open and showed Jules the call sheet and let him skim, watch the lines make more sense to someone else\u2019s eyes. There were things he hadn\u2019t noticed; the long, important one that said: PRODUCERS TO SHOOT HOME VT MONDAY AM \u2013 YRK \u2013 SCHOOL/LOCAL AREA/FRIENDS. That made his heart do the thing it did when he almost knocked a mug off a table and then didn\u2019t. Jules read that line twice and then said, at exactly the same time as Eddie, \u201cWe have to tell Mrs Pennington.\u201d\n\nMrs Pennington took the news like someone receiving the announcement that a famous person would be borrowing their shower. She smiled in that careful headteacher way that keeps joy from interfering with paperwork. \u201cNo children\u2019s faces without parental consent,\u201d she said, immediately. \u201cNo filming in the toilets, which you would think would be obvious and yet, I feel the need to say it aloud. No jokes about the school being a \u2018stage\u2019, I\u2019ve heard them all and they make me fear for the quality of the nation\u2019s metaphors. And I want to see their risk assessment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can come in every shot if you want,\u201d Jules said, from the corner where he\u2019d come with a stapler as if it were a shield. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you star wipes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not do wipes,\u201d said Mrs Pennington, with dignity. \u201cGet me forms. And for the love of healthy crumbs, Ming, please hoover the staff sofa before they arrive. That thing is a universe.\u201d\n\nLorna rang to discuss the plan and she had the warmth of someone perpetually at a brisk walk. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking shots of you at your school, you walking past a beautiful-yet-relatable local landmark, you with a friend whose top has words on it. If there\u2019s a pet in your life we can include or a child you\u2019re fond of who won\u2019t lick the camera, that\u2019s absolutely gold. Are you okay to talk a little about your mum?\u201d\n\nHe felt that small, private tug again, the one that said: you do not owe everybody your dead. \u201cI can talk,\u201d he said, which was true. He didn\u2019t say what he wanted to say, which was: I can sing her, which is different.\n\nThey came in a van that pretended not to be a van, white with the shame of logos peeled off. They had clipboards and those puffer jackets that either keep you warm or make you look employed. They put small lights where the winter was sulking and they put a fuzzy microphone cover on a pole and called it by a name that made it sound like a pet. The children went wild without moving from their chairs. There is a particular hum to a school when telly arrives; it is reverence and cynicism at once. The little ones stared openly; the big ones tried to look bored and failed at their eyebrows. Mrs Pennington stood with an expression like a bust of a Roman who has seen it all and will allow it if it doesn\u2019t mess the marble.\n\nThey filmed him sweeping, which made him want to laugh because of course they did. They filmed him holding the mop with his hand in a place his hand never went unless someone had dropped glitter and it had migrated. They filmed him in the hall with the light coming in sideways and the cut-out snowflakes clinging on like pensioners at a disco. \u201cJust sing a line for us,\u201d said a woman with a nice face, and he did, and even though it was his school and his safe, his throat did that thing where it thought of locking. He stepped to the tape on the floor. He thought of breath and the shape of his mouth and the sound came like it always had, a thing he didn\u2019t do so much as allow. In the tiny speakers slung around their necks, it sounded tinny and not like anything at all. On the air between them, it was a bell you hear and decide not to mention because you don\u2019t want to brag that you heard it.\n\nThey asked him about his mother and he said her name and watched Mrs Pennington look at the floor in a way that meant she was listening and also being decent. He said how his mum had sung when she washed up, yes, and how she\u2019d had a laugh like a cough and how she\u2019d once done a turn at a social club because somebody had dared her. He didn\u2019t say the bit about her being sad sometimes in a way that took the cover off of the world and made all the things inside cold. He didn\u2019t say the bit about her asking him who\u2019d mow the lawn if she didn\u2019t, because she liked the lawn and she liked to pretend that nothing else mattered as long as the edges were neat. The producer nodded at the parts he said as if she was thinking about edit points and cutaways of hands.\n\nThey went to the reprographics room and filmed Jules holding up a selection of ridiculous T-shirts for the camera and being their best production dream, which was to say himself in sharper focus. He winked at the lens like a man in a pantomime who\u2019d learned kindness late and was proud of it. He said into the boom, \u201cI gravy you,\u201d and the sound man laughed, an actual laugh, the kind you don\u2019t hear on telly. They stood him and Eddie together with the big old printer making its dinosaur rumble and the camera loved them because cameras love old friends who have no reason to be old friends except they chose to.\n\nThey wanted a dog. Of course they wanted a dog. Eddie texted Maya and she came down with Pickle\u2019s lead and a row of apologies already queued up. \u201cHe may eat your world,\u201d she said to the crew, and the crew said, \u201cPerfect,\u201d in a way that made Eddie want to stand between the dog and the boom. Pickle did, in fact, try to lick the fluffy cover off the microphone and the sound man said a very quiet oh, and Eddie found himself crouching and bringing the dog\u2019s face to his and doing the voice he only did to dogs and one particularly alarming toddler. \u201cNo, mate,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, that\u2019s not lunch. That\u2019s a cloud. Leave it.\u201d Pickle blinked and left it and then tried to eat the lanyard of a young runner who laughed so hard he had to lean against the wall.\n\nThey took him to the Minster and had him walk with his hands in his pockets like a Victorian postcard of a thoughtful man. He did one take with his hands out because his pockets were his and he wanted the use of them, and the director said, \u201cCan you do it like you did but less hands,\u201d and he said, as politely as possible, \u201cI\u2019m from York; we\u2019re all hands,\u201d and Jules, who had come along with a bag of jam tarts because he was incapable of not feeding a crew, laughed so loudly a tour group turned. By the river, a swan glanced at them with the contempt only swans can manage, and Eddie tried not to think about the sawed-off story the show would make of his life, the neat little arc from mop to mic, as if the things in between weren\u2019t the point.\n\nAfter, the school felt thin with the absence of them and very itself. He put the bucket away in the cupboard under the stairs and stood for a second in the darkness listening to the building settle, a sound like a quilt being shaken. He had a train to catch in two sleeps. He packed in stages, clothes first, then the bits that made his mouth feel right\u2014a small tub of the fancy honey that had been a gift, a tin of mints he never ate but liked the idea of, his own pillowcase because hotel laundry smelled like sadness and fluorine. He put the suit on the back of a chair where it could watch him like a sensible friend.\n\nThe morning of travel, York station was a cathedral of steel and pigeons. The roof had its ribs out, proud and old, and people did the things they do in stations\u2014ran on crisp packet legs, stood and stared up as if salvation were on the departures board, hugged with a kindness that made Eddie look away because he did not want to be a witness to it unless invited. He had his case with its wheels that did that thing where they get ideas, and his suit in a bag which felt faintly absurd. He gave himself time for a tea that made its way into his hands in a paper cup too thin for love. A woman with hair like snow said, \u201cExcuse me, love, is that platform eight?\u201d and he told her and she patted his arm without looking and he felt upheld.\n\nOn the train, he found his seat by the window and pressed his forehead to the glass like a child until he remembered his forehead belonged to a man who didn\u2019t need a circle rubbed into it. Across the aisle, a lad with glitter on his cheekbone practiced a riff sotto voce and then looked up and saw Eddie watching and smiled with the roar of someone who\u2019d never learned to be embarrassed. He wore a jacket with studs on the collar and he looked like someone who would have been, in another time, the bravest person in a silent town, making the first noise. \u201cYou for the show?\u201d the lad said, the words rolling around his gum. \u201cMe too.\u201d He listed off a name that hadn\u2019t meant anything to Eddie last year and now meant the boy who\u2019d been filmed coming out of a lift during the auditions with his hands up, crying in disgust with his own happiness. The lad said, \u201cYou\u2019re the caretaker, innit?\u201d with affection rather than condescension, which eased something inside Eddie he hadn\u2019t noticed had tensed. They swapped first names and then both felt the pleasant oddness of knowing a stranger and then looked out of their windows, because northern men sometimes have to look at geology to come back to themselves.\n\nKing\u2019s Cross hunched into the day like a big beast. The roof was a lattice that reminded Eddie of the old playground climbing frame that had been condemned and made everyone sad. He walked past the tourists queuing to be witches and he smiled because he remembered a girl from last year\u2019s Year 4 who had cried at the idea that if you ran at the wall and it didn\u2019t open it might be your fault. Lorna was there outside Boots with a clip-board like an upgrade to a herald. She waved and kissed the air on both sides of his head and directed him into a taxi that smelled like five cigarettes had been smoked in it yesterday and forty eggs boiled in it last week. The driver had that London habit of narrating other people\u2019s bad decisions under his breath. By the time they arrived in the big, sensible hotel near enough to the arena that it looked like it might be under its skirt, Eddie felt both smaller and larger.\n\nThey gave him a lanyard with his name on, and he would have slept with the lanyard on if it hadn\u2019t felt like a betrayal of everything he\u2019d learned about strangulation hazards. The corridors were long and neutrally carpeted like a thought you haven\u2019t decided to have yet. His room was like every other hotel room and also not. He pressed the switch for the lights twice before he tried the slot with the card and remembered he needed to feed the room with the right plastic the way you feed fish. He put the suit in the wardrobe, which had those anti-theft hangers that made you feel like you were about to commit a very low-level crime. He texted Moira a picture of the bed with its rectangle of chocolate and she sent back: STEAL THE CHOCS IN THE HALL TOO and three kisses and then wrote, immediately, DON\u2019T, YOU\u2019RE ON CAMERA and then: JOKE. He lay on the bed in his clothes with his shoes off and allowed himself one heavy exhale and then got up because lying down felt dangerous.\n\nThe stage the next morning was not a stage so much as a small nation. It had steps that lit up if someone told them to and it had screens the size of confessions and it had a crew who looked as if they had been born fully grown in headsets. The first time he walked out, nobody looked because everybody was looking at everything else, and he loved that. He loved not being the point until he opened his mouth. He stood on the tape they had for him, a bright cross that made his own tape at school look shy, and he smiled at the floor because floors had saved him in his life more than anyone gave them credit for. A woman with an iPad introduced herself as vocal and asked him to do the song in his key then half a tone down then half a tone up and he did as he was told and didn\u2019t mind until someone somewhere in a bank of monitors said through a speaker, \u201cCould he do something more current?\u201d and he had to resist the urge to say, \u201cI am current, I am the current carrying the sound to wherever you sit.\u201d He said, instead, politely, \u201cThis one fits me like my jacket. I can stand in it.\u201d\n\nThey tried him with in-ear monitors, small rubber thoughts that sat in his ears and made his own voice sound like someone had pushed him underwater. He did it without and then with and then with one in and one out, and the stage manager gave him a look like a cat considering a leap. \u201cDon\u2019t pull,\u201d she said, as if he were a child and the wire were a tablecloth at a birthday party. The LED behind him looked like the inside of a crystal ball and Eddie had to stop himself from turning around and staring at it until someone told him to go home.\n\nIn the dull gaps that make up most of the life around the bright, he met some of the others, those brave kids and those grizzled boys and those women with eyes like trumpets. A mum from Milton Keynes who had three under five and still had lipstick and appetite; she shook his hand with determination and said, with that directness of the time-poor, \u201cIf I cry on telly please don\u2019t judge me, it\u2019s only because no one else cleans the bathroom properly.\u201d A lad with a name like a fruit who sang as if he\u2019d lost a bet with God but was going to win next time. The glitter boy from the train sang and made the hair on Eddie\u2019s forearms lift very small. The crew had that efficient style of care that is half-shepherding and half-kidnapping, and Eddie allowed himself to be placed and turned like a chess piece and did not mind because it was a privilege to be on the board.\n\nHe called Moira from the corner of the foyer under a rubber plant too shiny to have ever seen dust. The kids made three different noises down the line and the Labrador barked once in approval and Moira said, \u201cWe\u2019ve made a banner that says GO ON ED YOU BEAUTY and if the telly man tries to confiscate it I will cry and then I will write to my MP,\u201d and Eddie laughed in the way that relieved his chest. Jules texted him a photo of a T-shirt on a hanger that said SHOUT IF YOU LOVE FLOOR POLISH and then sent another that said THIS ONE SAYS \u2018BELT THEN BREATHE\u2019 SHOULD I BUY and Eddie told him no and yes, in that order.\n\nHe went back down for a last run and Lorna caught him with that neat lasso of hers. \u201cTiny thing,\u201d she said, which meant it wasn\u2019t. \u201cWe might have a clearance issue with your song. The person who owns the writing isn\u2019t saying yes yet. Can you have a couple of alternates ready in your back pocket?\u201d\n\nHe could feel the tape in his chest trying to come unstuck. He nodded with care and said, \u201cI can,\u201d because he could, because he had a long list on a cereal box at home and most of the cereal had fallen on it and stuck and he had still kept it, superstition and glue. He went upstairs and poured water from a little untrustworthy kettle into a little untrustworthy pot that called itself coffee and tasted like an apology. He stood at the window and watched the arena\u2019s skin shimmer with its own business and he hummed something that wasn\u2019t the song he wanted and wasn\u2019t the song they wanted and was maybe his. He sang it under his breath and let it sit in the room with him until it became less shy.\n\nIn his head, he went back to the school hall where the light comes low and kind and to the smell of dust that knows all your names. He went back to York and its stones that had been looked at by kings and pigeons in equal numbers. He saw Pickle in the corridor, looking at him with that open-minded foolish love. He saw the tape on the floor and the line he put down himself and the exact place he stands and he thought, if the song shifts, the shape of me doesn\u2019t. He took a breath and held it the way you hold the hand of a child crossing a road, not tight, just steady, and when he let it go it didn\u2019t rag out of him like panic, it drifted in the particular way good breath does, like something that knows its job.\n\nHe slept poorly in the way hotel sleep is poor\u2014too hot where you don\u2019t want to be and too cold where you do\u2014and woke twice to the sound of laughter that might have been a television in the room next door and might have been his own thinking having a party. At six, his phone vibrated itself off the bedside table and he lunged with that reflex that belongs to people who have known damp and cracked screens. It was a message from Lorna. Can we meet in wardrobe at eight to discuss look? Also, clearance still pending. Have alternates. Sorry for short notice. X. The x felt handwritten even though it wasn\u2019t.\n\nHe stared at the message for a second, then got up and did the thing he could do: he made a list on the hotel notepad in the pen that had the hotel\u2019s name on and no ink for the first three strokes. He wrote: Wild Horses. He wrote: Harvest Moon. He wrote: The One He Should Not Touch, and crossed it out twice for luck. He wrote: A Change Is Gonna Come and underlined it and then underlined it again and then put a star next to it and then took his hand away because he did not want to wear out the paper where he might put his finger. He brushed his teeth and sang the bit that floated on the vowel and it sat right. He looked at his suit in the wardrobe and he looked at his old school trousers folded on the chair because he\u2019d brought them in case the suit felt like a costume. He touched the fabric of each as if he were making a blessing. The corridor outside his room breathed quietly through its air-conditioning and somewhere, miles to the north, a dog turned twice in a narrow hallway and lay down with a small grunt like an old man.\n\nHe went down to wardrobe. It was a room that looked like the mind of a person who can see colours inside numbers. There were racks that made a thicket of sequins. There were rails of black in case anyone had confidence. There was a woman with a tape measure who said, \u201cStand still, pet,\u201d and took his collar number like she was reading a coded message. They tried him in a different jacket and he could tell the exact point at which he stopped being himself and started being a version of a man the jacket imagined. He went back to his own. \u201cIt\u2019s you,\u201d said the tape-measure woman, who had earned the right to say such things and not sound like a gift shop. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the only thing I have to say.\u201d\n\nBy nine, he had sung every alternate in a corner with a chair that had begun life as a throne and then gone through a divorce. The sound of the building putting itself together was a kind of sea. Glitter boy lent him a throat lozenge that tasted of eucalyptus and effort. The Milton Keynes mum hugged him before her cue and left lipstick on his cheek and then came back and scrubbed it off with her sleeve with the brisk love of a nurse. In the gap before notes, when the stage was idle and the screens showed the log-in page of a computer someone had forgotten to put to sleep, he checked his phone and saw a photograph from Jules. It was the corridor at home. The sign on the noticeboard read: NO NUT WEDNESDAY! and under it, in Jules\u2019 careful print, someone had added, THIS INCLUDES TV PRODUCTION and Eddie snorted so loudly the stage manager glanced up.\n\nAt eleven, a man with hair better than some promises put his head around a door and said, to no one and everyone, \u201cClearance is through.\u201d Lorna appeared behind him with the expression of someone who had wrestled a dragon and only lost a shoe. \u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d she said to Eddie, just like that. \u201cYou\u2019re on. Do the thing you do. But at the end\u2026 more.\u201d She waggled her fingers in the international gesture for glitter and also for giving yourself away and Eddie nodded as if he might pick more up in aisle five. He went and stood on his mark and the lights woke like morning and he took his breath from the back and the ground and he thought of the corridor and the dog and the school and the jam and the way the city leaned to listen when he talked to it kindly and he opened his mouth and let it come.",

                              "content": "He didn\u2019t do the thing they all do where they stare down the camera like it owes them money. He looked out into the room, found the line of light that ran along the lip of the stage like a tide mark, and planted his feet like someone who knows about tides. The first note wasn\u2019t a declaration; it was a door opening. He let it swing on its hinges with the gentleness of someone who\u2019s been taught not to slam. The room, full of people whose job it was to be bored by noise, forgot for a moment and remembered to listen. It wasn\u2019t magic. It was breath and practice and the bit of the throat you don\u2019t own because it\u2019s a gift from somebody else. He thought of the tape on the hall floor and how he never stepped over it, and he found the equivalent here; the point where the note wanted to run away with him, and he held it by the hand instead.\n\nThe big screen behind him showed his own face, unhelpfully magnified, and then cut to his VT, a little film of his life, and he saw the school hall looking braver than it ever did at eight fifteen with the milk crates and a child crying because someone had sat on their sticker. He saw himself sweeping in a way that was a lie, too elegant by half, and Mrs Pennington with a plant on her desk like a moral position. He saw Jules lift a T-shirt and grin, and the camera seemed to have fallen a little bit in love with him, because of course it had, and he felt a ridiculous surge of pride on behalf of a man in a jumper that said PLEASE DON\u2019T TALK TO ME ABOUT BEES. He saw a quick flash of Pickle, pupils like two friendly buttons, a paw on Eddie\u2019s palm in a handshake that giggled. He almost laughed on the vowel, and then didn\u2019t, because he had work to do.\n\nWhere the song lifted, he didn\u2019t show off because he couldn\u2019t; showing off is loud and he had learned over years that quiet can be the bigger noise. He did the thing Lorna had asked for at the end, the \u201cmore\u201d, not with fireworks but by stepping forward that quarter-inch, by allowing the note to crack at the exact place it still sounds like truth and not like failure. It landed in the room with the private heaviness of an apology that means it, and for a second there was the delicious drop before anybody clapped, the moment that makes performers greedy for the whole weird business of being looked at. And then they did clap, and they stood, and the people who sit to be contrary stood too and pretended they\u2019d always been headed upwards.\n\nThe panel did their faces. He was far enough away to be grateful for distance. The nice one, the woman who had hands that spoke even when she didn\u2019t, leaned into her mic and said how she felt like she\u2019d been in her kitchen watching her dad sing on a Sunday morning and that it had made her want to ring him, which was not about him and exactly about him. The stern one, a man built like a verdict, made a joke about mops that nobody minded because he followed it with a note about the control in the soft bits. The one whose job it was to be fashion had a compliment that sounded like a brand of handbag, and then the boy at the end who wore sincerity like a cardigan leaned with his elbows on the desk and said, \u201cEd, I think people at home will have looked up and thought, oh, I know him. He lives on my street. He helped me carry a wardrobe once. More of that, please,\u201d and the crowd did the little murmur that means: we\u2019ve decided.\n\nHe said thank you in that way the show trains you to say thank you, but he added, because he couldn\u2019t not, \u201cI\u2019m from York,\u201d as if that explained anything. Something in the room moved its weight from one leg to the other. He walked off without tripping on a single cable, which felt like a win bigger than votes, because he had once snared his ankle on a vacuum cord in Year 1 and gone down in such a slow, tragic spiral that two children had applauded.\n\nBackstage had its own weather. The air was colder, the carpet had a long memory, and people moved with a purposeful, sideways gait, as if they were all trying to get around each other without waking a cat. He stood just behind the flats and let the flush leave his face the way steam lifts off a cup. Someone he\u2019d never seen before pressed a bottle of water into his hand with the grave courtesy of a person who knew where the spare batteries lived and therefore ran the world. Glitter boy, who had gone on before him and screamed joy so hard that a piece of the lighting rig might have reconsidered its life choices, head-butted his shoulder gently and said, \u201cYou ate that,\u201d in the tone of an artist agreeing to share a stage with a plumber.\n\n\u201cDid I?\u201d he said, because he\u2019d been in it and had the memory singers have of the thing they\u2019ve just done, which is a shape in the palm rather than a picture.\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d said Lorna, appearing and doing a small dance of relief that made her headset wobble. \u201cWe got the bit with the hand. It was beautiful. And nobody cried grotesquely, which is Christmas for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s my fringe?\u201d he said, because there was nowhere safe for his humility to go and he had to put it somewhere.\n\n\u201cHonest,\u201d she said, which made him laugh and then swallow because the laugh threatened to turn into something that would make curious people feel they should pat his shoulder.\n\nThey shepherded him to a room with a high table and tea that tasted like a polite handshake. The others were in there too, the clatter of medals after a race nobody wanted to describe yet. The Milton Keynes mum was on her phone saying to someone, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine, yes, you can put them in the bath together, the bath will not break,\u201d and then she looked up at him and mouthed you were lush and he mouthed back you too in the awkward sign language of people who know that voice is a limited resource. The boy with the fruit name sat, for once, very still, like someone had told him the chair was an animal that spooked easily.\n\nThey rolled the VT on screens in there with the sound off and subtitles on and he watched his own life with the captioned lies and the tiny truths. The words said EDDIE DREAMS OF BIG STAGES even though he didn\u2019t, not exactly; he dreamed of small rooms with good light and honest sound. It said HE WANTS TO MAKE HIS MUM PROUD even though she was past the making proud and into the part where the word is simply miss. It didn\u2019t mention Pickle by name, and he felt a ridiculous protective flicker about that, as if the dog had dodged a tax.\n\nHe went where he was sent and did the small things that pretend to matter. He stood still while they lifted his jacket at the shoulder and put a microphone back in the place promise lives. He let a woman with kind eyebrows brush powder across his nose because the lights had opinions about sweat. He answered into a camera: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m feeling good, I\u2019m feeling grateful, I\u2019m feeling like my shoes are on the right feet,\u201d and the runner laughed down his sleeve and Eddie felt comforted by causing one human to grin in a corridor.\n\nYork watched, because of course it did. In the King\u2019s Arms, the water licked at the stone outside and made the sound old pipes make in winter, and the regulars stood for his last note because somebody started it and nobody wanted to be the one who didn\u2019t. Jules had a table like a small landing pad piled with paper plates because he\u2019d brought a stack of jam tarts and then panicked and added sausage rolls just in case. He clapped at the television in the way that makes other people clap, and then the barman, who only applauded for military tributes and darts, hit the counter with his palm and said, \u201cThat\u2019s our lad,\u201d and looked annoyed with his own softness. At Moira\u2019s, the banner went up and then slid slowly down because the tape had ideas, and she cried before he even opened his mouth because she\u2019d decided it saved time. The children jumped on the sofa until her stern voice came out and told them the springs were for sitting, and then they balanced on the arms like little dangerous gargoyles, eyes round. In the launderette, the owner turned the sound up and three pensioners who\u2019d brought their wash in a single bag and a friendship that had outlasted three husbands and four cats pressed their lips in concentration, then softened. Mrs Khanna leaned on her counter and said to no one, \u201cAh,\u201d when he took the breath, like someone getting the right crossword clue at last. In the flat upstairs, the television flicker bounced in the gloom of the hallway and Pickle put his head on one side as if the sound had a smell. Maya shushed him and then said, apologetic for no reason, \u201cIt\u2019s Ed,\u201d like she had to explain the geography of their hearts to a dog.\n\nBetween show and results there is a long stretch of waiting that feels like a bus you\u2019re not sure is coming. They kept everyone busy because that\u2019s the trick. A small man with a laminated smile took them to talk to the online stream about what they\u2019d eaten and who they\u2019d bring as a secret guest if the world allowed impossible things. Eddie said, \u201cMy mum,\u201d and then, because he had promised himself he wouldn\u2019t offer her up for cuts and clip reels like a relic, he added, \u201cAlso my sister, because she\u2019d keep me humble and tell me to put my shoulders down.\u201d They took a picture with a light ring that made his eyes look like he had good news all the time, and then they put him in a little pen made of stanchions and tape and people with good will and told him to be surprised at things that had been planned all day.\n\nThe host, who wore satin like a joke on himself and had legs that understood stairs, said his name and other names and then stretched the words like bread that doesn\u2019t want to tear. It was all numbers and noise and the sound of own heartbeat, an old friend who sometimes knocks. Eddie felt behind him for his mark like someone feeling for a light switch in a rental. The lights turned a different temperature; the room did that thing where everyone inhales at once. He held glitter boy\u2019s hand without making it a thing and glitter boy squeezed like someone trying to crack a walnut and failing. Names were called, bodies went safely across to the next week, a tidal movement, relief and guilt and cheer all standing side by side looking sheepish. It got down to three bodies. Eddie\u2019s was one of them.\n\nHe felt the air thin, and the old stupid thought rapped at the door like a cold caller, the one with laminated leaflets. You are a caretaker. You care for things; you are not the thing. He told it, with obedience and then with steel, to wait in the corridor. The host read out a third name and it wasn\u2019t his. The bottom two were him and a boy who could bend notes into skateboards. There was a cheer, because crowds are strange and love blood in the way that never gets less bewildering the more you experience it. Lorna, just out of his line of sight, lifted her chin the exact amount that meant: breathe out, then in, then out. He did as he was told and had been telling himself to do his whole life. The host said sing-off like it was a treat. Eddie laughed, quietly and inwardly, because he had a second song in his pocket like a boiled sweet you keep for a bus stop.\n\nThey moved the furniture on the stage in that coordinate chaos that looks like a fight you don\u2019t want to break up because it\u2019s choreographed and nobody will get hurt. The boy went first and did that modern thing of walking and pleading. He ended on his knees in a way that might have been spontaneous and might have been science. The panel did faces. The room did a small, anticipatory hiss, the sound radiators make when they\u2019re about to get on with it.\n\nHe didn\u2019t change his mind. He did the one with the promise in it, the one he\u2019d written down twice and then put a star by because sometimes you need to speak a wish out loud and sometimes you let the song do it so you can get through the day. He flattened his hand on his stomach because that\u2019s where the voice starts, not in the throat, and he thought of all the small changes he had watched happen and the long ones he had hoped for and the ones you don\u2019t get to see, the way you plant a thing and the leaves belong to someone else. He started low, like stone. The note went up like a ladder he knew the rung distances of. He didn\u2019t climb out of himself, he stayed where he lived and let the room come to him.\n\nHalfway through, on the easy bit that looks hard if you\u2019ve only ever done shouting, he let a fraction of a smile happen. It wasn\u2019t to show off. It was because he heard, in the back of his ear, some long-ago social club and his mother laughing at the exact wrong moment and making it right by accident. The end came and it wasn\u2019t a punch; it was a held hand. He let it go. The room did the little silence again before clapping, and he took that into himself like somebody allowed him a second biscuit without a fuss.\n\nThe panel did what they do. The verdict man did a heavy sigh first, to show he understood the weight of everything, and then said the boy next to him deserved to be here but so did the man who made a room quiet. The nice one made a shape with her hands that meant shelter and said, \u201cEddie, that was church,\u201d in a way that didn\u2019t mention God and yet did. The fashion one said something about authenticity, which in another room would have made him bristle, but here felt like being told his shirt suited him. The cardigan boy said, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I want both of you to stay, but I need my mum to text me in ten minutes and say she felt less worried about everything for the length of your song, and that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s the thing,\u201d and the crowd made that sound that means they\u2019ve given their hearts to a stranger but they\u2019ll want them back by the end of the show.\n\nThe vote went to deadlock because of course it did, because the gods of ratings and pacing needed their coins on the eyes. They filled a minute with a recap of the two of them pulling faces like men on a carnival ride that had them in the wrong age bracket. Eddie looked down at his shoes because looking at your shoes sometimes tells you more than looking at a million faces. They were his own; he\u2019d buffed them in the hotel with a hand towel like the boy he\u2019d been at church who\u2019d learned to make leather shine when he couldn\u2019t control anything else. He had a random thought about the school toilets and whether the flushes were still doing that high, forlorn whistle because the caretaker from the agency didn\u2019t know you had to lift the cistern lid and nudge the arm. It soothed him in a way that felt silly and exactly right.\n\nThey said his name. They didn\u2019t say it wrong. They didn\u2019t add or take away letters. He recognised the sound of his own syllables in the mouth of a man who said five hundred names a night, and he felt a tiny spike of ownership that warmed all the cold places. He was safe. The boy next to him did a gallant nod that would do him well when he was older, and went off with the sort of grace that looks like it grew there but is always cultivated. Eddie stood there while the host did hand flutters and cheekbones, and he felt the weight leave his shoulders like someone had taken a bag off without his noticing the strap.\n\nHe went off as they told him, and in the corridor he breathed like normal again and then like happy and then like you do when you\u2019ve run for a bus and gotten it. Lorna kissed the air near his ear and said, \u201cRight, you have to do press,\u201d with the relief out of her voice now, and he followed the little red people with lanyards to a corner that smelled like wires and makeup.\n\nIt was the same questions with different eyebrows. How do you feel. What did that mean to you. Who are you thinking of. Are you the surprise of the season. He answered like a man who knows what questions are for; he offered pieces without laying himself on the altar. \u201cI\u2019m grateful,\u201d he said, and meant it like a slice of toast after a long day. \u201cI\u2019m thinking about my city. I\u2019m thinking about the kids at school. I\u2019m thinking about whether my sister remembered to defrost the peas.\u201d He said, because the cardigan boy had given him permission to say a stupid true thing and let it be, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about a dog who doesn\u2019t know what telly is and would eat it if he could.\u201d\n\nBack in his room, the quiet hit him like a duvet with a grudge. He turned on the small television because the little version of the thing you were just inside of is a weird comfort, like reading the leaflet for the museum you\u2019re already in. He watched the tail of the show catch itself and wag. He texted Moira, Are you up or are you up? and she wrote back in half a second with a photograph of her face shining and her eyes swollen and the children doing a victory pose behind her and the dog, the gentle Labrador, with his head on the sofa like an old cushion. She wrote, Mum would have called me up to talk about it for an hour and then told me off for the phone bill, and he felt the little punch of love that comes with a sentence that puts the dead in a room without your permission. He wrote back, We\u2019ll talk now and I\u2019ll tell you off, and she typed out a paragraph and deleted it and typed out another, and then called. He went to the window with the phone to his ear and looked down at the car park where a man in a high-vis jacket was laughing silently at something on his phone, bent double, a private happiness he had wandered into with his eyes.\n\n\u201cAlright?\u201d she said, the word a question that contained two decades and a lot of dinners.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m alright,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n\nShe took a breath that was half a sob and half a laugh and said, \u201cI\u2019m full of gravy and enthusiasm. I\u2019m not well.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nThey did ten minutes of words that were mostly noises and both felt improved by it. When he hung up, there was a message from Jules that said: You were not bad. I\u2019ve sent a blistering letter to the producers demanding more custard. Also, the sign now says \u2018NO NUT WEDNESDAY\u2019 in my handwriting and I am ashamed. He sent a photograph of himself in a hat that said CREW in biro and nothing else and his eyes were red not from sadness but that particular, lovely, late night arrhythmia.\n\nHe slept as well as a man who had been fed on noise can. He dreamed that the stage was the school hall again, that the LED screen was a big pinboard covered in sugar paper with titles like BIG DREAMS! and the staples made constellations. In the dream, he stood at the safe tape and a small hand slipped into his, not his own child\u2019s hand because he had none, but some generalised small hand that represented all the children he had taught to walk on clean floors. He woke up with his palm still slightly curved as if it had been holding. The room looked like a hotel room because it was. He did a little hum to check the voice was still where he\u2019d left it. It was, polite and ready.\n\nThe next day was mostly being shown rooms and then being moved out of them. He met a woman with a clipboard who had three watches and knew what time it was in all the places Eddie had never been. He did a radio show on a sofa that had seen better interns. He sat next to a comedian who had had his eyebrows threaded professionally and smelled of travel. He said Yonks without meaning to and the presenter said, \u201cOh, I love that word,\u201d and he thought of his mother and her bag of words like Weetabix and Fettle. He let the days flow over him like a river with occasional shopping trolleys.\n\nBack home, York did what cities do when a small story in its bones goes national. The paper at the station put his face above the fold in a way that would be used next week to wrap fish fingers. A tourist asked a tour guide, \u201cIs that the man from the telly?\u201d and the tour guide said, \u201cYes,\u201d even though he didn\u2019t know, because it makes stories stronger when you let them breed in the wild. The Minster did not notice him because the Minster has seen too much to clap, but a small boy on a scooter outside it said to his mother, \u201cHe\u2019s the singing man, he fixes the toilet,\u201d and Eddie, who was not there to hear it, would have been pleased to be remembered for plumbing. Maya found herself telling her tutor that her neighbour was famous and then felt immediately silly and immediately proud and sent a photograph of Pickle looking at the television with his head cocked and his ear inside-out to Eddie, who laughed in his hotel bed and saved it into a folder called \u2018Work Stuff\u2019 because of course he did.\n\nTom, who had watched at the depot because there was nothing else to do while the forklift was sulking, said to a man with a face like a thumb, \u201cThat\u2019s our upstairs,\u201d and the man said, \u201cReally?\u201d and Tom said, \u201cHe\u2019s alright,\u201d in a tone that included both apologies and ownership. Later, in the corridor that was always a little bit damp no matter how much the dehumidifier worked, Tom said, \u201cSaw you on the telly,\u201d and Eddie said, \u201cSaw you on the stairs,\u201d and Tom laughed like a drain clearing and, for once, clipped the lead properly.\n\nIn the school, Mrs Pennington printed out a photograph and put it on the noticeboard underneath NO NUT WEDNESDAY, then took it down because the picture had a child in the background whose mum didn\u2019t like photos and then put it back up again with the child sensitively cropped, which resulted in a laminated slice of Eddie\u2019s elbow that did not have the desired effect. The children made pictures of him with crayons that turned him into a superhero with a mop. Someone wrote in spidery letters, MR GARSIDE YOU ARE THE BEST AT CLEANING AND THE BEST AT SINGING AND ALSO YOU ARE VERY TALL, and he would keep that in the green tin for longer than awards are designed to last.\n\nWhen he came back for forty-eight hours, because the schedule said: RETURN HOME FOR VT TOP-UPS and he read it as: GO SEE YOUR PEOPLE, he went straight from the station to the school because he wanted to smell it. It smelled like glue sticks and faith. The Year 2 cloakroom tried to kill him with a bag strap and a shoe with a personality. He leaned into the staffroom and said, \u201cAlright?\u201d and the room stood up like a body with many arms. Jules had baked something citrus that looked like a flan and tasted like every good decision he\u2019d made in the last five years. Mrs Pennington hugged him, which she doesn\u2019t do, and then pretended she hadn\u2019t by immediately remarking on the bin rota. He went down to the hall at eleven and the light in there did the same old kind thing and he stood at the tape and sang one line for the janitor\u2019s cupboard just to be polite and the cupboard, being an inanimate friend, received it without comment.\n\nOn his way out, the corridor hummed with lesson time and a boy with hair like a dandelion seed head stopped dead and said, with urgent authority, \u201cSir,\u201d and held up a hand. Eddie stopped because a Year 1\u2019s hand has the power of a red light. \u201cSir,\u201d the boy said again, \u201con the telly, don\u2019t fall off.\u201d Eddie looked at him and it was like being given a helmet by a tiny knight. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d The boy nodded, satisfied, mission discharged, and went back to learning about owls.\n\nThat evening, on his own stairs, he met Pickle who did not try to eat his laces. The dog sat like he had decided that democracy was worth a go. Eddie crouched, rubbing the ears that had learned to be less pointy, and whispered into his fur, as if he were wild and needed coaxing, \u201cWe\u2019re doing alright, aren\u2019t we?\u201d The dog licked his knuckle with the solemnity of a notary public. Maya watched from the landing with her chin on the banister, the light catching the little flyaways around her head. \u201cYou were good,\u201d she said, simple as a glass of water. \u201cMy mum cried and my dad pretended he was cutting chillies.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them it\u2019s only telly,\u201d he said, and she rolled her eyes because she was twenty-three and had a glorious contempt for false modesty when it got in the way of a good clap.\n\nBack in London, the week had been laid out for him like a buffet with labels in two languages. Theme: Icons. Duets: Possible. Song choice: Negotiable if you argue nicely and bring a biscuit. He went into meetings where men in deceptively casual shoes told him about brand alignment and he nodded as if brands were furniture and he was measuring for skirting boards. He stood, again and again, on the mark that had become familiar and had the hum of something safe now; the stage no longer felt like a motorway at night but a well-lit bit of A-road with clear signage. He did the alternate in rehearsals so everyone would feel he was flexible and then did his own in the moment because he had decided that if he was going to go out he\u2019d do it wearing his own jacket and not someone else\u2019s.\n\nOn the Thursday before the next live, Lorna pulled him aside and told him they\u2019d like to try something with staging that suggested York without putting a cathedral on a screen. \u201cWe were thinking cobbles,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were thinking a lamp with a long shadow. We were thinking, and this is me, not the team, a quiet dog in silhouette, just a joke for three people.\u201d\n\nHe stared at her, stopped in the corridor by the accuracy of being known like that without being consumed. \u201cAlright,\u201d he said. \u201cBut no silly flat caps.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo silly flat caps,\u201d she agreed, and in her voice he heard the apology for some previous silly flat cap inflicted upon an unwilling person.\n\nHe rang Moira that night and they said, at the same time, \u201cI\u2019m tired in the good way,\u201d and then laughed. He kept the television on mute and watched the replay of his own first week like it was a wildlife documentary where he was thrilled to see the animal had not fallen into a river. He laid his suit jacket across the back of the chair with the hanger still inside it, because he was a man who had learned some lessons from hotel wardrobes. He thought about what the nice judge had said, not the content but the tone, the way it had made his ribs spread without him saying please. He thought about how many days you get to feel that in a normal life and how none of them are promised and then he promptly thought about whether the caretaker agency had black bags or the flimsy ones, and he was grateful for his brain\u2019s loyalty to dim concerns.\n\nThe next morning, he walked past the arena\u2019s side door, where deliveries came and went like small ships. A man stood there in a parka smoking a cigarette with the dedication of an old world sailor. \u201cYou\u2019re the caretaker,\u201d the man said, not a question.\n\n\u201cAm I,\u201d Eddie said, smiling because sometimes it\u2019s sweet to be called by your function.\n\n\u201cMy missus cried,\u201d the man said. \u201cWhich is not your fault, it happens when she sees dogs on Instagram as well. But. You sang nice. It ran round the room and came back. Good lungs,\u201d and he flicked ash in a way that looked like punctuation. Eddie thanked him like someone receiving compliments on a roast potato, with careful deflection and genuine pleasure. He went in and let the door shut gently because he hates the sound of a fire door slamming, even in buildings where it is an acceptable noise.\n\nHe sang the song he was meant to sing and two he wasn\u2019t, and at the end of the day his throat felt like he had been laughing at a wedding and had to stop only when the vol-au-vents ran out. He drank water from a bottle with a sippy top without caring how he looked, because survival has no dignity. He sat on a crate with a sign that said DO NOT SIT and ate a banana Jules had pressed on him in a napkin on the platform like a protective auntie. He watched glitter boy teach a camera operator how to do a little step-touch and admired people who share joy like that without keeping score.\n\nThat night, he slept and the dream came again; the stage that is the hall, the tape that is the tape. Only this time when he went to that safe line, the small hand in his gave him a tug that meant, We could. We could go forward. Just a tiny overstep. He woke with his heart doing a tap that was not unpleasant. He lay there for a while in the hotel dark that never gets entirely black because electricity has opinions. He thought about rules he had made for himself that nobody else had asked him to sign. He didn\u2019t resolve anything. He got up and made hotel kettle tea that tasted like despair and metal, and he drank it anyway because strangers had put it in the room and he is polite.\n\nOn the night, they put the cobbles on the screen behind him. Not obvious, nothing that would make a resident point and say, That is a misrepresentation of our gutter pattern, sir, but a suggestion, a hint, the way a smell takes you to another room. A lamplight was placed at a polite distance, casting its little theatre pool. The silhouette of the dog turned out to be too much even for Lorna\u2019s sense of humour; it flashed up for half a second in rehearsals and the stage crew laughed, and then they decided to keep it to themselves, because there are jokes that exist just to lift a day and then go to bed.\n\nHe sang and it felt like a conversation with somebody who had been on a bus for a long time and needed to talk at a stop. His voice had the small, proud rasp that comes from effort and from not pretending you are something that you deludedly think you should be. He took the breath at the place he had taught himself to take it in the hall and he let the end do its little honest break. He stepped forward a hair\u2019s breadth from his mark, not to woo a camera, not to tick a box called \u201cconnection\u201d, but because he had decided his feet might like the closer air. If superstitions had lungs, his exhaled and smiled.\n\nAfter, back in the room with the tea and the chairs and the waiting, the Milton Keynes mum, who had gone out and returned and was vibrating with adrenaline and sugar, said, \u201cYou did the thing,\u201d and he said, \u201cWhich thing?\u201d and she said, \u201cThe thing where people at home forgive themselves for not being loud,\u201d and he wanted to write that down on the back of his hand, but he was the sort of person who would only smudge it, so he put it in his pocket with the boiled sweet.\n\nHe sent Jules a message that said, You watching or are you kissing someone, and Jules sent back a photograph of himself with the T-shirt that said BELT THEN BREATHE, perched on the pub stool like a small, delighted frog. He wrote, Kissing the idea of you, darling, and then Doe from Year 4 has been allowed to stay up and has drawn you with lasers coming out of your eyes and I don\u2019t know where she got that from but it\u2019s accurate.\n\nThere are weeks in a life that bunch together like unhelpful wires. These did. Between songs and set-ups and the odd corridor dance to keep circulation going, he found time for small kindnesses that were the only way he knew to make a room fit to be in. He lifted a cable for a man whose back had given out doing heroic work for years; he told a runner to sit because she looked like she\u2019d forgotten she had legs; he carried glitter boy\u2019s absurd boots from one side of the hall to the other like precious cargo; he let a woman cry into his shoulder about nothing the way people cry about everything, and didn\u2019t ask what the tears were for because they don\u2019t always need to be for anything and because he knows about mops.\n\nOn a long lunch break masquerading as a meeting, he walked outside. London had its smell on; dust and chips and rain thinking about it. He found a bench facing a bit of building that had been there before him and would be after. A pigeon with a chest like a proud grandfather hopped, considered, agreed with him about the bench, hopped on, hopped off, lived its shimmering life. A man from the crew sat next to him, breathed quietly for a bit, said nothing, left. Eddie thought of York, of the fossil river of the Ouse, of the way the city in its off-season wears its beauty like an old jumper and still looks handsome. He thought about the dog and whether someone had remembered to buy puppy toothpaste because the vet had said his gums would need friends. He thought about the school, about the little boy with the hand up saying don\u2019t fall off, about the sign on the board, about the brakes on the caretaker\u2019s van that had a language of their own. He felt simultaneously necessary and extra in the best way. He went back inside because there was air in there he had to use.\n\nOn the Sunday after two weeks of live shows, he got a text from an unknown number that started, Ed love, which meant it could only be from someone who\u2019d been given his number by someone who thought the world was smaller than it is. It turned out to be from an aunt on his father\u2019s side, a woman with jewellery that arrived in a room before she did. She wrote, Your father is so proud, darling, though he wouldn\u2019t go on the telly in case he saw himself, and Eddie stared at the sentence like it was an animal he didn\u2019t know whether to pet. He was not cruel. He wrote back, Thank you. Give him my love, which was the truth he could carry. He thought of his father mowing the lawn in long straight lines that made sense even when nothing else did and of how some men say I care about you in clippings and gutters.\n\nThey asked him for a duet for week four if he made it that far, and he said the name of a woman whose voice wore velvet and they laughed because of budgets and he laughed because laughter is the only answer to budget. They suggested a person who had once won something similar and turned into an album. He said yes because that was the game and because she had a nice smile that didn\u2019t look rented and because she shook his hand like his mum used to, from the shoulder. They sang together in a tiny room first, a rehearsal within a rehearsal, and for the length of a bridge he forgot he was someone who fixed chairs and remembered he was someone who could stand next to a person who had a big voice and not get knocked over by the wind of it.\n\nAt some point in the muddle of it all, he went to the Minster on a visit home, not for God, though God was welcome to eavesdrop, but for the acoustics. He stood at the back like he was a tourist in his own life and listened to someone practising something that meant business on the organ. The sound filled his ribs and arranged his organs and told him truths about pipes he already knew and was happy to be told again. He lit a candle because he always did, because it meant light continued without his supervision, because it was five minutes of beauty that didn\u2019t demand an underline. He didn\u2019t say a prayer because he couldn\u2019t think how to begin, but he thought a feeling and gave it the shape of his mother\u2019s name.\n\nWhen he left, a woman in a sensible coat with the look of an ex-teacher stopped him at the door and took his elbow the way Yorkshire women take the world and said, \u201cWe\u2019ve all been watching. My Jim says if you don\u2019t make it we\u2019re writing to our MP,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d and she said, \u201cWe know,\u201d and then added, because she couldn\u2019t help herself, \u201cAlso don\u2019t go flat on the end, it\u2019s not your best note,\u201d and he loved her immediately and sincerely and nearly cried with relief at the correction.\n\nIt didn\u2019t feel like a rise. It felt like a set of stairs. He took each, swore softly in the old-fashioned way when one had a tiny crick, put his hand on the banister for the sheer pleasure of wood. He thought, now and then, of stopping, of stepping off to the side and letting the ones with hunger that ate them from the inside race on. But the thing kept offering him little reasons to go on; a letter written in pencil from a child in Year 3 with spelling like a beautiful ruin that said, Dear Mr Garsid you maked my nan smile and she hasnt since grandad, a jam tart wrapped badly in clingfilm that had stuck to itself and been rescued by a neighbour, a message from Maya that simply read, Pickle hasn\u2019t chewed your boots today, progress!!!\n\nHe took the stage each week like a room he was allowed to use for a bit if he returned it in the condition he found it, but with a little polish. He did the thing he knew how to do: he kept his place. He sang with respect for silence and for the woman who had taught him to do the washing up in the right order so the greasy pans didn\u2019t ruin the clean water. When the end came\u2014and of course there is an end to everything, that\u2019s how we get to sleep at night\u2014it wasn\u2019t with a scandal or a miss or a bum note. It came on a week where he did something quiet and needed a hurricane, because sometimes the show wants a jacket thrown and he had buttoned his neat. He stood at the bottom of the stairs while the host shaped his mouth around words like journey and proud and slammed and he nodded and meant it and didn\u2019t die because he wasn\u2019t fifteen. He said into the camera and the room and whichever corner of the sky had decided to host him that he was grateful, and he said thank you to the crew and the panel and the children at St Olaf\u2019s who would be delighted to see him back and tell him his hair looked weird up close and ask if he\u2019d met any famous dogs.\n\nBackstage, in the little pocket of air where grief goes to see if it\u2019s needed, he leaned against a bit of flats and let it come up and out of him like the last bit of a breath you\u2019ve been saving for emergencies. People touched his shoulder in the solemn way the British have invented to avoid intimacy, and he loved them for it. The Milton Keynes mum squeezed him so hard his spine popped and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll keep in touch,\u201d in the way people always do when what they mean is, We will try. Glitter boy cried like sin and didn\u2019t care, eyes full of clean rain, and said, \u201cYou can have my boots,\u201d and Eddie said, \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d and they both laughed until someone told them not to ruin their makeup.\n\nHe went back to the hotel and the room was just a room again, without the hum of live wires. He took off his suit carefully, like he was undressing a friend who was asleep on the sofa. He hung it up and patted the shoulder because he couldn\u2019t help himself. He called Moira and she answered immediately and said, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d in a way that meant, Are you still Eddie, and he said, \u201cI am,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood,\u201d and then they both cried in the selfish, happy way that people who are safe get to.\n\nHe went home on a train that seemed to think it didn\u2019t need to hurry. He watched the land flatten and then fold around itself, watched the mucky shoulders of fields and the shy approach of cities. He got off at York and the station did its old trick of making you feel like you belong to a story with steam in it. He walked through the concourse and a man in an orange vest nodded without making a fuss and a child pointed and then pretended they had pointed at something else, and a woman said, \u201cWell done,\u201d and he said, \u201cTa,\u201d and it was enough.\n\nOn his landing, someone had taped a sign to his door. It was written in three hands. The top, neat as clipped hedges, said: WELCOME HOME E. GARSIDE. Underneath, Jules had added, I GRAVY YOU, in a big victorious loop. The third, a spidery contribution from a child upstairs who still reversed their n\u2019s sometimes, read: YOU ARE FAMOS. Pickle barked once from behind a door and then scratched gently, which was new. Maya opened with a smile that started low and ended in her eyes. \u201cHero,\u201d she said, deadpan. \u201cHelp me carry this pram up; my friend\u2019s dropped it off and I\u2019ve immediately underestimated the concept of stairs again.\u201d\n\nHe picked up one end and they did the narrow-house carry dance, steps and pivot and respectful cursing. The building smelled like wet hall and lives. He put the pram down, scratched the dog, who had remembered how to be gentle in the two weeks he\u2019d been away, which is a miracle of beginning and persistence. He went into his flat. It looked like him. The mugs were where he\u2019d left them; the green biscuit tin sat with its ridiculous treasures. He put his bag down, heel, toe, heel, toe, and stood still in his own air.\n\nThe phone on the counter had a little blinking thing that meant messages, and he pressed buttons like a man in an old sitcom who has not yet worked out the relationship between technology and hope. There was a voice from the school, one of the office staff with cheer like a weapon, saying, \u201cCome in when you like, I\u2019ve told the cleaners to leave the hall floor for you because I know you like it how you like it.\u201d There was a voice he didn\u2019t know saying something about singing at a thing that sounded made up and he would decline politely in the morning. There was the voice he only expected when somebody had died and it wasn\u2019t; it was his father, with a breath between words, saying, \u201cEd. Saw you. Good lungs. When you can. Come for a brew,\u201d in the heroically uninformative way men of his village spoke. He stood very still, because moving might shake the phone and make the words fall off.\n\nHe took the tape out of the biscuit tin and put a new piece on the hall floor where the carpet had a small fray. He stood at it. He sang a long, low line, just enough to let the breath know he was home. The radiator did its gradual applause. Somewhere above him, the dog turned twice and slept. Outside, the city, which had survived worse and would survive better, leaned into its night. He made tea in his best cat mug, because sometimes ceramics give you permission to be sentimental. He sat at his little table that he\u2019d sanded himself and put his big, hard hands on the pine and let them rest, open, as if someone might put something in them. He didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d do next in the way of television. He knew there would be glitter on his boots for months. He knew the school needed its hall done and the Year 3 toilets still squeaked like a bird with a secret.\n\nIn the morning, he\u2019d go in early, before dawn, and the corridors would sing for him again. He would hum while the floor was wet because he couldn\u2019t help himself, and Mrs Pennington, if she caught him, would say, \u201cNot while it\u2019s wet,\u201d and he would say, \u201cIt\u2019s a whisper hum,\u201d and she would pretend not to hear. He would stand the chairs in sevens and set the tape and watch the motes go up like applause. He would be himself. He would be more. He would be a caretaker still, with a capital that made sense. He would carry things, and he would sometimes put them down. He would pick up the dog on the stairs when he lunged and say, \u201cNot today, mate,\u201d and the dog would settle because even storms have eyes. He would sing in the hall because that\u2019s what halls are for and leave the door open a crack because sometimes sound needs a way out into the rest of a building. He would keep, in the green tin, a card with gold letters and a piece of paper with a crayon drawing of a man with lasers for eyes. He would be famous for exactly as long as it suited the world, and he would be known forever by the people who mattered. He would begin again, because that\u2019s the song he\u2019d been practising all his life.",

Eddie arrived before the sun admitted anything, keys ready in his hand like a priest with bells. The building breathed its old breath as he let himself in; he could have found the light switches blind, the way you can find the tap in your childhood kitchen in the dark. He walked the route he always walked, corridor to hall to toilets to staffroom, the way a person checks on sleeping children. His body did the list without his brain having to attend, which let his brain wander off and think about other business like a goat with a string on it. He thought about the call on his answer machine from his father that had said almost nothing and had implied the whole weather. He thought about the suit in his wardrobe and whether he could get the glitter out without giving it ideas.\n\nBy eight, the school began to fill with the small sound that starts a day; the voices in the distance, the zip of coats, the clatter of book bags, the holler of a name that is both a greeting and a warning. Mia from Year 6 came in wearing an expression that suggested she had invented the morning and would sue if anyone altered it. \u201cSir,\u201d she said, like a court officer. \u201cOn the telly you looked old. But good old. Like a radio.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cI will accept being a vintage appliance.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you meet Harry Styles?\u201d she said, as if he might have had time to pop into a boyband on the way to a studio.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, because he didn\u2019t and because honesty is the first lesson you owe children. \u201cI met a very handsome man who knows about sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame thing,\u201d she said, and swept on to her peer mentoring duties with the seriousness of a judge.\n\nMrs Pennington did her rounds with the list in her head and a biro behind her ear. In the staffroom she put a Post-it on the biscuit tin that said, Please leave the ginger nuts for people with sore throats, and then lifted it and, in smaller handwriting, wrote, But if you are sad, you may also have one. She came to find him in the hall because habit has as much gravity as the moon. They stood together in the back and watched the caretaker\u2019s day be itself. She said, with that particular warmth she turned on five degrees at a time, \u201cYou haven\u2019t gone full diva, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cI asked the Year 2s to carry me from the gate like Cleopatra,\u201d he said. \u201cThey declined on health and safety grounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cThe governors would have opinions.\u201d She looked at him properly then, in a way she rarely let herself when things needed doing. \u201cYou did well,\u201d she said, short and simple, as if she were handing him a key. \u201cYou didn\u2019t embarrass us. That\u2019s my standard. You exceeded it.\u201d\n\nHe made a joke about standards so he didn\u2019t have to swallow around a lump that showed itself, cheeky and unexpected, like a child out from under a table. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman coming in at eleven to talk about headlice,\u201d he said, right back to business. \u201cShe says she\u2019ll need a socket.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course she will,\u201d said Mrs Pennington. \u201cParasites are hungry.\u201d\n\nAfter break, he went to the office and printed out a sign that said WELCOME BACK and stuck it up in the corridor at an angle that made Jules pretend to faint. Jules wore a shirt that said EAT THE RICH BUT MARINATE FIRST and had brought him a slice of something lemon that glowed like nobility. \u201cYou\u2019re still you,\u201d Jules said, peering at his face as if fame might have rearranged it. \u201cIt\u2019s a relief. I was worried I\u2019d have to start calling you Edward, like a posh sofa.\u201d\n\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cCall me Edward and I\u2019ll start making people\u2019s shoes squeak.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you get the message from your dad?\u201d Jules said, too casual to be casual. \u201cYou said you had one on the machine. You going to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think so,\u201d he said. The thought when he turned it over was sharp and dull at once, a butter knife that could still do damage. \u201cHe asked me for a brew.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery him,\u201d Jules said. \u201cDo you need me to stand outside the window and mime instructions for when he gets strange?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we can both do strange without instruction,\u201d Eddie said, and they smiled at the floor like men who know the floor keeps a lot of secrets.\n\nHe took the bus later because a bus lets you think without looking, and his legs were tired from the week in a way his brain approved of. He went to the estate where the houses sit with their shoulders together and said, to his reflection in the bus window, \u201cAlright,\u201d the way you do before a test you\u2019ve revised for and may or may not pass. His father\u2019s front garden was a work of geometry and stubbornness; the hedge was clipped with such obedience you could have used it for measuring straight lines. The path had been swept that morning, you could tell from the particular drag of the brush that left a signature like handwriting. He pressed the bell, then felt silly because his father had never believed in bells, and knocked. The door opened on the second knock because nothing in their family was ever allowed to be urgent.\n\nHis father was smaller, obviously, because time takes a little off the top and a little off the sides, but he wore his shirt with dignity and his hair had the exact amount of product it had always had, which was none. \u201cEd,\u201d he said, as if Eddie had gone to the shop for milk. \u201cCome in.\u201d\n\nThe house smelled of polish and onions and the faint, comforting ghost of damp that old walls keep around for luck. They went into the kitchen because kitchens are where you go to be honest in Yorkshire and also because the kettle was there, and his father put it on with the kettle\u2019s own fussiness. \u201cSaw you,\u201d his father said, looking at the spoon drawer because looking at his son would have made the spoon drawer redundant. \u201cOn the telly.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you,\u201d Eddie said, because sometimes you repeat the thing to make sure it\u2019s happened.\n\n\u201cGood lungs,\u201d his father said again, as if it were a diagnosis. \u201cYour mother would have\u2026 she would have had a lot to say,\u201d and there it was, the slight wobble that was allowed, the acknowledgement of the woman who had run the house now running everything else, somewhere you can\u2019t tidy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll pretend she\u2019s here and she\u2019s told us we\u2019re doing the tea wrong,\u201d Eddie said, and took the mugs down because the body knows the choreography. They drank, and they did it the way men do when the line is tight and you can\u2019t afford to wobble, every joke a little plank bridging a drop. His father showed him the new mower as if introducing him to a pet, and Eddie admired it with the proper ritual gestures, the nod, the hand on the handle, the observation about stripes. His father said without fanfare that he\u2019d kept Eddie\u2019s mum\u2019s headscarf in the drawer because sometimes when he was cross with the washing machine he needed to nod at it, and Eddie didn\u2019t cry because he wasn\u2019t allowed, but he looked away at the hedge and told it to stand very straight, and it did.\n\nOn the way home, he went past the little studio above the bakery near Fossgate where bands who looked like maths teachers recorded their albums that sounded like weather. He\u2019d been there once to pick up a microphone the school had borrowed and forgotten to return on time, and the man who ran it had said, in a voice like a bass line, \u201cYou sing, don\u2019t you,\u201d and he\u2019d lied and said he cleaned. The sign in the window now said, Special rate for local heroes, which made him snort and then consider and then stand in his own indecision like it was a puddle. He went in, because going in is braver than standing outside thinking about going in.\n\nThe studio smelled of fresh bread because of course it did and cables because why wouldn\u2019t it. The man behind the desk had hair that had given up and a smile that had not. \u201cEd,\u201d he said, because York learns your name and uses it. \u201cSaw you on the big shop. Congratulations. Fancy putting something down so your grandchildren have proof you were young?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot young,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cNot dead either.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe make records for most quantities of alive,\u201d the man said. \u201cYou want to think about it. People will call you for a bit. You can go down to London and eat tiny sandwiches with discussions about next steps, or you can make yourself small and neat and honest in a room above a bakery and sell it to people who will give you a fiver and a promise that they told their aunt. Both are viable. One ruins your taste in tea.\u201d\n\nEddie laughed in that way that shifted something fragile into a safer place. \u201cCan we do it in the school hall,\u201d he said, because the question had been chewing the back of his tongue since he\u2019d sat under the studio\u2019s friendly ceiling. \u201cIt\u2019s my room. It\u2019s got my sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring me an extension lead and two permissions and we\u2019ll make the walls sing,\u201d the man said. \u201cI\u2019ll bring mics and a biscuit tin, you bring the voice,\u201d and it was sorted in the old way with a handshake and an implied invoice and the smell of bread.\n\nHe asked Mrs Pennington the next morning and she did her head tilt that meant, I\u2019m thinking about insurance and also trying not to be moved by sentiment. \u201cIf you do it after school,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t film children. If you credit the school in a way that will not result in angry letters from people who own logos. If you let the Year 4 recorder group have five minutes of your set to get used to microphones. And if you clear up afterwards, including any emotional debris.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmotional debris is my specialist subject,\u201d he said, and she made the face she made when she nearly smiled and then put it back in a drawer for later.\n\nIn the evenings, he went with Maya to the puppy class because discipline is easier in company and he liked to watch layered learning, the dogs and the people both. The woman who ran it wore practical boots and hope and had the patience of an airport. Pickle learned sit properly, not just the accidental sit of a dog who has run out of ideas. He learned leave it with a face like a monk turning down pie. He learned to look at Eddie\u2019s face when Eddie said his name, and Eddie\u2019s chest did a small, silly swell because being looked at by anything with goodwill is a tiny knighthood. Tom came to one class and stood at the edge like a scarecrow and said, \u201cHe likes you,\u201d and Eddie said, \u201cHe likes anyone whose pockets smell like chicken,\u201d and Tom laughed and then did a thing with his mouth like an apology he didn\u2019t know how to deliver. Later, on the stairs, Tom said, without looking, \u201cMaya\u2019s dad thinks you\u2019re good for her,\u201d in a tone that was trying to be kind and not managing it because it had rocks in it. Eddie said, \u201cMaya\u2019s good for herself,\u201d and then went into his flat and leaned on his own door because words are heavy sometimes.\n\nThe day the committee from the Minster rang him, the phone showed an unknown number and his stomach did a small mare\u2019s skit. \u201cMr Garside,\u201d said a voice with old wood in it. \u201cWe wondered if you might consider singing at our Christmas concert. We\u2019re trying to be both inclusive and not boring. You appear to be very good at making people who hate singing admit that they were moved.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s March,\u201d he said, because he had to say something.\n\n\u201cThat is when Christmas begins in Minsters,\u201d the voice said, unhelpfully. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk again. Leave space for it.\u201d\n\nHe hung up and laughed with glee at the absurdity of diaries that included December in spring. He told Jules and Jules was delighted inconveniently and started sketching an outfit on a Post-it that involved a cape and a holly-based epaulette. He told Moira and she said, \u201cIf you get near that altar I will combust,\u201d and then she told him to eat, because she was constitutionally incapable of not telling him to eat. He told his father and his father said, \u201cIt\u2019s big in there,\u201d which both was and wasn\u2019t advice.\n\nWord went around, in the way word does, that Eddie was doing a record. Mrs Khanna from the shop said, \u201cPut me down for two, one for me, one for my sister in Mumbai who collects British men with sadness in their face, she will like you very much.\u201d The Polish baker said, \u201cI will swap you a CD for a loaf and never stop that swap,\u201d which sounded like the kind of deal that lasts generations. A boy from Year 5 asked him earnestly if the record would be vinyl or \u201cold-fashioned on purpose\u201d and Eddie said it would be whatever the man above the bakery could get without selling a kidney. Maya pretended to be unimpressed in the way of someone who is delighted and very twenty-three, and Pickle sat on Eddie\u2019s foot while Maya talked, which in dog is a marriage proposal.\n\nThey recorded in the hall on a Tuesday, after the line of after-school clubs had cleared the door and the PE mats had been rolled into their blue cylinders like sleeping giants. The man from the studio arrived with his mics and his optimism and they placed them like flowers along the edge of the stage, where the good sound lives. He sang as if the building had ears, which it does. He sang the ones that suited the wood, and the ones he had picked in shops without knowing it, and he sang one he had never dared to sing out loud because it was the one his mother would have sung as a joke and then not as a joke. Jules sat on a chair at the back with a face like the moon and kept his breath as quiet as his claps were loud. Mrs Pennington drifted in and out with the look of someone pretending to be doing important things with paper while actually casing a robbery. The man from the studio stopped them after the second take of a thing and said, \u201cThat\u2019ll be the one, we won\u2019t do better,\u201d and Eddie felt the odd, rare peace of having done a thing exactly right in a room where he knew where every scuff on the skirting board lived.\n\nOutside, the light went blue and then navy and then velvet, and the school made the soft creaks of buildings that have done their job and are resting. They packed the mics like putting instruments to bed, and he walked around the hall with his hand on the chairs for no good reason other than love. On the way out, he found the Year 1 sign about owls still stuck to the door with Blu Tack that had gone grey with experience. He straightened it and smiled at the picture of a bird that looked more like a lemon with eyes than any owl had ever looked. He locked up with the prayer of a man who knows exactly how to secure a lock in a way that will not annoy the next morning.\n\nAt home, he made toast and put jam on it because jam is moral and sat with his socks on and listened to the takes on his laptop with his good headphones, which were not that good and had been repaired with tape that had lost its stick. It was odd hearing himself not in his head but from outside. He listened with the careful ear of a man checking a floorboard for squeak. He did not fall in love with his own voice because that would have been a betrayal of every boy he\u2019d been who had been told to button it. He allowed that the sound did the thing he meant it to do. He let himself smile, small, and then large when Jules texted, This is so handsome it should pay council tax.\n\nThe week moved in that school way that is both slow and suddenly gone. He fixed a wobbly desk with his little kit and felt temporarily like a surgeon. He took a splinter out of a child\u2019s hand and was thanked with a solemn look and a sticker that said YOU DID IT. He sat on the floor in the corridor with the yearbook committee and taught them the difference between serif and sans-serif because someone must. He had breakfast in the staffroom one morning with a yoghurt that had seen better days and thought, in that sudden way you think while stirring, I could be elsewhere, and then slightly scolded himself because elsewhere is a preposition pretending to be a plan.\n\nOn a Saturday in April, the river decided it liked its banks less than usual and came up to lick the bottoms of walls. The King\u2019s Arms did its famous thing of shrugging and putting its furniture on bricks. Eddie stood on the bridge with a bag of carrots like an old mathematics problem and watched the brown water give him a calm he couldn\u2019t have bought. Pickle, on his lead because they had all learned, peered over with sensible caution and then sneezed at his own boldness. Maya said, \u201cTom\u2019s moving to Hull for a bit,\u201d without preamble, the way some sentences need to be said before they can be understood. He looked at her and said nothing for a second because advice would be a cheap sweet right now. She added, \u201cHe says it\u2019s a job and I believe him and also I don\u2019t believe him. Both are true. We\u2019re not\u2026 you know. And I am fine. I am fine like a plate with a chip, but you\u2019d still put cake on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d always put cake on it,\u201d he said. \u201cEven more. People like to eat cake on plates that have seen things.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, tired and bright. Pickle leaned against Eddie\u2019s shin because he had decided to lean there. The dog had got bigger without telling anyone and had learned that strangers were mostly stories that turned out alright. Eddie scratched his ear and thought that some men turn into dogs and some dogs turn into men and both are improvements on certain afternoons.\n\nThere was, because there always is, a man in a suit who wanted him to do an advert. He met him in a hotel lounge that had been decorated by someone with a powerful interest in cushions. The man said words like exciting and opportunity and synergy without irony, and Eddie smiled with his polite mouth and nodded with his head while his spirit made a sandwich and stood by the window. The advert was for a cleaning product that had chosen the slogan FIND YOUR SHINE and the man wanted Eddie to sing in a corridor while a child in a tutu slid across a floor like hope. He tried to imagine himself doing it. He tried to imagine the school watching and laughing with him not at him. He tried to think of money as commas in a life rather than a sentence in its own right. He said, \u201cLet me think,\u201d and the man said, \u201cOf course,\u201d in a way that meant, Decide quickly because the world rolls, and Eddie left with a mint and the relief of being outside a room where decisions had to be made.\n\nHe sat with Jules in the reprographics room and told him and Jules said, \u201cDo it for the money if you want the money. Don\u2019t let your heart be the face of anyone else\u2019s soap. Also, the photocopier\u2019s developed a new whine in E minor, it\u2019s absolutely vile, I love it.\u201d Eddie nodded and put the advert in the same drawer of his brain he kept Christmas until November and the phrase bone broth. He would open it if he needed it and if he didn\u2019t, it could stay there politely and gather dust.\n\nHe had the odd night now where someone would ask him to sing in a room where you don\u2019t expect singing. He sang at a retirement do for a headteacher who had been at the school so long she\u2019d taught parents and then their offspring to hang their coats. He sang at a fundraiser for the local hospice where the room was full of people who clap like prayers. He sang at the market on a Saturday morning in exchange for a bag of apples and he sang at Jules\u2019 cousin\u2019s wedding because Jules\u2019 cousin had eyes like diamonds and wanted the aisle to be a question with a nice answer. Each time, he did his job the way he always had, and when the breath came right and the note sat, he was quietly grateful to muscles and luck.\n\nHe went to see his father again on a Tuesday, because Tuesday is a forgiving day. They did their ritual. They looked at something that was not each other and spoke about something that was. His father showed him a photograph he had found of his mother in a red cardigan with the sleeves pushed up, singing into a wooden spoon with a laugh that showed her back teeth. \u201cShe would have liked to be on telly,\u201d his father said, and Eddie said, \u201cShe was, once,\u201d and his father nodded because this was not a correction you could fight. On the way out, Eddie tidied the shoes by the door because he could not help it, and his father pretended not to see and also stepped over them with a tiny, grudging appreciation that might have been a thank you.\n\nIn May, the school got a notice that the council were sending round someone to check the fire doors and the PAT testing and whatever other acronyms keep children from electrocuting themselves. Eddie prepared the building like a mother-in-law was coming. He replaced batteries with the concentration of a man defusing a small bomb. He put signs at child height. He made the corridors smell like oranges and discipline. The man who came had a clipboard and an expression like an unmade bed and said, \u201cNice work,\u201d as if he were awarding a knighthood, and then ticked boxes so thoroughly Eddie wanted to take the biro out of his hand and have it framed.\n\nIn July, when the light finally acted like a friend rather than a drunk who might fight you, the city had its summer fair by the river and Eddie had a slot between the ukulele club and a man who made animals out of sugar. He sang three songs and watched the way people listen when they are not obliged to by tickets and seats, the particular quality of attention that feels like a child offering you a shell. He looked out and saw, to his great alarm and gratitude, his father at the back in a hat that had belonged to a friend and a smile that had never belonged to anyone else. After, his father shook his hand with more solemnity than the paper had needed when Eddie was born, and said, \u201cWell done. You made the air different,\u201d which was almost everything.\n\nHe was halfway through August when the letter came from the Minster with its posh paper and its plan. The carols, yes, but something more. Would he consider guiding a community choir for an evening in November as a rehearsal for the rehearsal, a way of making new voices less frightened of stone and people. He went in to meet the Canon who had the kind of handshake that made you imagine they\u2019d leave butter in dishes at room temperature so it spread properly. The Canon said, \u201cWe have too much of the shiny sometimes,\u201d and gestured at the ceiling which was older than ambition. \u201cWe need the other thing. You\u2019re good at the other thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOrdinary,\u201d Eddie said, because the word had become his friend and he was unembarrassed by it.\n\n\u201cOrdinary the way bread is ordinary,\u201d the Canon said. \u201cWhich is to say, necessary,\u201d and Eddie said yes before he had time to think of reasons to put it off until his retirement from everything.\n\nOn a Sunday in early autumn, when leaves tried out their showmanship with bravado and premature crumbling, he and Maya took Pickle to the big field at the back of the museum where dogs have political meetings. Pickle had learned to return when called and then forget a minute later and pretend it was a new concept, like an old man refusing to understand contactless. Eddie threw a ball and Pickle ran with the devoted idiocy of the young and brought it back as if he\u2019d never been away. Maya talked about her dissertation as if it were a living creature that left hair on the sofa. Tom had gone to Hull and sent texts like postcards, brief and sunny and not answering the questions asked. Maya had begun to wear a look in her eyes that meant, I am future-proofing. She said to Eddie, \u201cYou know when people ask you what\u2019s next and you want to say, the washing up?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s next is we get through Tuesday. What\u2019s next is eggs. What\u2019s next is I don\u2019t forget the blue bag with the dry cleaning in it like I did last time. There\u2019s a carol service in December which might break me. There\u2019s a child who is going to audition for the school play and think about it every day until she dies. There\u2019s a man who is going to offer me money to sing about soap again. There is a puppy who is going to decide at an inconvenient moment that fox poo is a cologne. There is everything, and also, right now, there\u2019s this field.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him with that fondness you have for a friend who is a bench. Pickle attached himself to Eddie\u2019s trouser leg like a badge and then let go and bounded at a spaniel with the arrogance of a toddler at a teenager. The spaniel bore it manfully and then taught him a quick, clean lesson about personal space, and Pickle came back to Eddie with the affronted dignity of someone who has been told to mind his manners. Eddie crouched and scratched the muscle at the back of his neck and said, \u201cGood lad,\u201d and meant, Good lad for learning. Maya sighed like a woman able to see several possible futures and picked up the lead as if it were both a rope and a ribbon.\n\nThe record came back from the place where they make things flat and real and it felt ridiculous and thrilling to hold a square with his face on and his name. He had not let them airbrush his laugh lines because they were his favourite proof that he had laughed most of his life. He and Jules had spent a stupid evening arguing about font sizes until their eyes crossed and had settled on something that looked like it had been painted by a steady hand on a fairground ride. He did a little signing in the bookshop that still smelt like books and was run by a man who had read most of them. People came in and bought two and made him write to Auntie Jean and to Sarah who had the thing and to a man called Big Dave whose real name was David and who was not big but had arrived at the nickname in honour of his personality. He wrote nicely because you owe legibility to those who love you.\n\nWinter went up in the city like someone had hung fairy lights on the bones of the year. The Minster put on its own clothes and the market smelled of cinnamon and damp wool. He ran the rehearsal for the choir with the care of a man carrying a cake down a narrow street. They were a raggle, gloriously. Teenagers with fringe and fury, men who had come because their wives had told them to and then found themselves enjoying the vowels, women who had been told they couldn\u2019t sing by tiny tyrants in childhood and were there to disprove a myth. He stood in the nave and made a joke about God\u2019s acoustics and watched the fear leave faces like a tide met by a contrary wind. He taught them about breath in the way his own body had learned it; not as a performance trick but as a way of staying alive. By the end of two hours, the Minster had turned them into singers the way a good pan turns ordinary into stew.\n\nHe got told off by the Canon for swearing very gently when a top note slipped away. He apologised and blamed the weather and then blamed his mother in the way that excuses nothing and explains everything. He looked up at the stone that had been touched by more hands than anything else he knew and made a promise that was not to anyone in particular. He would keep being himself even when the room required a different shape. He would tidy up after the show. He would leave the hall better than he found it.\n\nThe evening before the carol service, with lists taped to his fridge and his suit shaken within an inch of its hope, Eddie was in the stairwell tying his shoe when the dog downstairs began their usual pre-walk semaphore. Pickle did three small barks like punctuation and then a silence, which was unusual because Pickle respected commas but was contemptuous of full stops. Eddie went down with the plastic bag for bins that you carry even if you are not the dog\u2019s owner because God watches. The corridor was empty and the dog was not where a dog should be. He heard Maya\u2019s voice from the street, the particular pitch she used when asking the universe not to make a fool of her. He stepped out and saw the lead trailing like a question mark and the little crescent of black-and-white shooting towards the end of the road where the cars took the corner like a dare.\n\nHe moved without thinking in the way you do when someone else\u2019s heart is running into traffic. He did not shout because shouting is sometimes fuel. He made himself small. He went to the dog\u2019s left because that was the side they\u2019d trained him to read. He crouched in the road like an idiotic supplicant. He held his hand out flat because that is the shape of safety. \u201cPickle,\u201d he said, but not the hurry Pickle, the good boy Pickle, the voice with a story in it about treats and sofas. The dog, skidding on his own bravado, recalculated faster than most men would. He zigged, zagged, considered the bus and decided not, and lunged for Eddie\u2019s palm like he\u2019d been born for it. There was a car, of course there was, with a driver who had something on their mind that was not puppies or singer caretakers, and for a second that stretched out and examined itself, Eddie thought this is the exact shape of the way luck ends. He got his hand on the collar and turned in a way he had not turned since he was twenty five and thought dancing was something you could learn in a corridor. Something in his knee expressed an opinion that involved an ouch, and then there were hands and voices and Maya\u2019s sobbing laugh and the driver\u2019s apologetic swears and the smell of tarmac that you only notice when you are very near it.\n\nHe sat on the curb with the dog in his lap like a wartime photograph. The dog licked his chin and his ear as if checking he hadn\u2019t died, and Eddie said, \u201cI\u2019m alright. I\u2019m alright,\u201d in the way you say it to convince the air. Maya sat on the pavement and cried with her whole lovely face and petted the dog and Eddie in equal turns, and then they all laughed because laughing is the country you return to when you have been on a border. The driver said sorry again in a voice that made him sound like someone\u2019s son, and Eddie said, \u201cIt\u2019s roads. Roads do this,\u201d and meant, It\u2019s life, and the driver nodded with a relief that made a space appear around him.\n\nHe went upstairs, eventually, after everybody was done being a person in public, and sat on his floor with his back against his sofa and iced his knee with a bag of peas that had been promised to a curry. He looked at his suit and imagined singing in the Minster with a slight limp, and thought that if there was anywhere you were allowed to walk like you had learned something the hard way, it was a church with stones that had seen swords. He texted Lorna, out of habit, to say, No telly tonight, don\u2019t worry, and she sent four kisses and a photograph of a cat as if to counteract the adrenaline. He told Jules he\u2019d nearly been run over by fate and Jules sent back, In this house we do not get run over by fate without texting me first, and then came round with Swiss roll and an ice pack, because that is friendship\u2019s dialect.\n\nHe slept hard, the sleep of the nearly-hurt, and dreamed that the hall\u2019s tape moved itself forward an inch without asking him, mischievous and right. In the morning, he tied his shoe with care and looked in the mirror and saw a man with a line down the side of his face where nerves had misplaced his smile for a second and then discovered it again. He ate eggs because nerves like protein and honey because courage likes sweet, and he put on his suit and he stood for a second in his own doorway and he said, \u201cDo the thing you do,\u201d to his reflection, because sometimes you have to be your own Lorna. He stepped out into the stairwell, which smelled of dust and effort, and went down, steady, one step then the next, because stairs are just songs you do with your legs. He met Pickle on the landing and the dog sat without being asked and lifted a paw like a gentleman. Eddie shook it, solemn as a priest, and went out into the cold that had decided to be festive rather than cruel. Cloud hung low over the city as if listening. The Minster rose like someone taking a breath to sing. He went to meet it, and his knee twinged once to remind him he had a body and then settled, and the day opened like a door on good hinges.",

Eddie stepped through the side door with his knee telling him its opinion in a language he could respect and ignore. The stone had its own breath, cool and intelligent, and the first thing it did was make you quiet even when you had come prepared to be loud. He stood just inside, letting the air settle his jacket on his shoulders, and felt the strange, sure clicking-in that sometimes visited him in certain rooms; the sense that his insides and the architecture had agreed a tempo.\n\nThe Canon met him under an arch that had never learned to be impressed by people and shook his hand with relief disguised as formality. \u201cYou look like a man who wrestled a dog and won,\u201d she said, eyes flicking to the protective arc of his body and the way he guarded the knee without fuss.\n\n\u201cJust a small game of traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe called it a draw.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod favours fools and dog-walkers,\u201d she said. \u201cCome, your tribe is assembling.\u201d\n\nThey were, all shapes and ages, gathered in the nave like a rumour that had gone right. The community choir stood in a loose herd near the front, coats half off, pride sat shy in the corner of mouths. A teenager with a silver hoop through one eyebrow tapped a folded piece of paper against her knee in time with a beat only she could hear. A man who looked as if he could fix a tractor hung back by a pillar and watched the others commit to the idea of being seen. Two women who might have been sisters if not in blood then in the way they shifted weight in the same rhythm whispered and nodded, a duet without sound. Eddie looked at them and felt that old, campus peace: I can make this better for a minute, and that will be enough.\n\nHe began as he always did, not with notes but with breath. He made them laugh on purpose first because laughter opens throats without asking permission. He talked about the body as a bell and the ground as the clapper and made a fool of himself once so that no one else had to. When he made them put their hands on their own stomachs he did it too, and when his knee wobbled on the second stance he let it wobble in public and made a joke about aging as if it were a far-off rumour instead of yesterday. The Minster bent its listening down to them; the sort of acoustics that don\u2019t flatter so much as keep you honest, returning exactly what you give but warmer.\n\nThey ran through the carols that had come with the letters of the year tucked in their folds. There was the one that made the older men look briefly like boys in blazers, staring at the floor as if it had answers. There was the one that allowed the altos to be secretly magnificent. There was the one with the sudden, sneaky key change that, if mishandled, could spill you into embarrassment, and when it came he showed them how to step into it sideways rather than leap. When the organist arrived and flicked the instrument awake, the sound puffed through the building like a memory, and even the teenager with the hoop stopped pretending to be bored.\n\nBetween requests from the Canon and nods from the organ loft, Eddie took his place at the little lectern where his name had been printed in a font that suggested the church had opinions about fonts. He made himself look up, not at the great window that had bullied better men into believing, but at the faces. School faces half-hidden behind pillar and parent, Mrs Pennington in a sensibly warm coat with the look of a woman allowing herself to enjoy a thing she had already catalogued, Jules perched at the end of a pew like a punctuation mark, wearing a tie with snowmen that managed to be both ironic and sincere. In the back, next to a stone knight who had been receiving visitors with patience for five centuries, his father stood with his hands flat on the top of the pew in front like he was bracing a workbench. Their eyes didn\u2019t meet because there are rules, old and kind. It was enough that the hat was off and the body present.\n\nRehearsal gave way to service the way afternoon gives way to evening, the light lowering its voice without feeling the need to explain. People came in with cheeks made red by the city\u2019s particular cold, with scarves that carried conversation. Children were coaxed into pews and promised oranges later by parents who knew the power of fruit with added ribbon. A boy in an oversized jumper announced in a hush that there were real candles, as if the Minster had finally earned his respect by becoming dangerous. Eddie stood to the side as the first words were said by a voice made for wood and listened as if the sentences could change the arrangement of his molecules.\n\nHis solo sat midway through, a song chosen because it had the weight he trusted and because he had once heard his mother sing the first line into a steam-silvered kitchen and then laugh at herself. He waited for his cue with his hand on the reading desk in a small habit he had stolen from priests. When it came, he walked to the place where the lectern spilled out into air and stopped before the invisible line that some version of himself had once insisted upon. The dream he had had the night before flickered in his body like a suggestion from an old friend. He looked down at the stone and then up into the soft, collective face of his city and its visitors and he moved his foot half an inch forward, not dramatic, not rebellious, just a human stepping into the shape that fit.\n\nHe sang the first phrase like he was opening a careful package in a room that contained breakables. The stone gave it back to him like a story told to an older relative you love, edited for kindness. He hit the breath at the place he had learned to in the school hall and the note laid itself along the columns and around the heads of people who had come to be forgiven for something small. He did not think of telly or of judgements or of cameras that do adding and subtracting at the same time. He thought of tea towels and recorders and towels draped over radiators like small defeated flags. He thought of a boy in Year 1 telling him not to fall off. He thought of his father\u2019s hands, square and capable, laid on a pew as if steadying a table before you saw to the screws. He sang and let the end show its little, honest crack, not as a party trick but as a finger pointing to the place where breath and truth shook hands and both went home slightly changed.\n\nIt was not the kind of applause you get on television with hands ready and camera red lights hunting for stories. It was the quiet ripple that happens in a holy place when people feel they should not add noise but cannot not say thank you. There was the shift of bodies, the collective sigh, the clearing of throats, little noises that are an admission. The Canon nodded once, small and complete. The teenager with the hoop raised her eyebrows at him with a generosity that did not have to commit to language. In the back his father moved his jaw and looked away and then back, the way people do when they have missed a bit of life and are trying to catch it up without running.\n\nThe choir did their brave work and the children's voices came up like odd birds, off in places, perfect in others, never untrue. At the end, when the last candle in its little army guttered and rallied and then gave up politely, the smell of wax and wool and December took the building by its old hand and walked it towards goodnight. People did the shuffle that means happiness has to get back to its car before the meter runs out. Eddie shook hands and accepted thanks like biscuits you must eat even if you are full, and then did the corner-of-the-eye meeting with those who did not want too much fuss. He saw students pretending not to be gleeful when their teacher\u2019s voice had done a nice thing and he saw Mrs Pennington tell a parent with calm ferocity that their child could, if desired, join the recorder club without expectation of exceptional talent.\n\nHe found his father near a pillar pretending to examine the carving of a bishop\u2019s foot. They nodded at each other because hugging seemed like a thing for another church or a future life. \u201cGood lungs,\u201d his father said, which had become both a joke and a sacrament between them. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go flat on the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a woman in a sensible coat warn me against it in October,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cI obeyed.\u201d\n\nHis father looked at the ceiling in a way that passed for awe and then back at his son\u2019s face that now escaped his best efforts not to look at it. \u201cYour mother would have\u2014\u201d he began, and stopped there because they both knew all the endings to that sentence and adding one would be like placing an extra chair at a table that already had enough legs.\n\n\u201cWe owe her a brew,\u201d Eddie said, and the little smile that appeared on the old man\u2019s face was the exact shade of his own when he had a dumb idea that felt right.\n\nThe night was the kind that made the city sound travel in clean lines. Outside, the Christmas market had dimmed to its last sugars and the stalls were packing up with a familiar clatter. Jules found them in the shadow of the Minster and handed Eddie a paper bag that warmed his glove; gingerbread in the shape of a star with a face, smile iced on with the confidence of someone who believed in the power of frosting. \u201cYou stole a bit,\u201d Jules said, meaning the evening, not the biscuit. \u201cYou thief. I\u2019m looking to report a theft of time and breath.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were conspicuously damp-eyed for a cynic,\u201d Eddie said, biting the point of the star and feeling it crumble in a way that satisfied something tidy in him.\n\n\u201cI am an emotional laundrette,\u201d Jules said, shoving his hands deep in his pockets because he had misjudged his coat. \u201cThe spin cycle was fierce. Also your father stood up at the good bit like he\u2019d been told to by fifty years of something and then pretended he was stretching. I nearly had to be mopped.\u201d\n\nEddie looked down the street where a fox threaded between groups as if it had tickets. He felt the slight pulse in his knee and the bigger, stranger pulse under his sternum that had nothing to do with exertion and everything to do with relief. Maya appeared with a hat on that made her look like a poem and Pickle in a sensible coat he pretended to hate. The dog, who had survived a small argument with destiny, sat without being asked and lifted a paw with the solemnity of a judge. Eddie shook it, and the dog leaned on his shin as if staking a claim and offering stability.\n\n\u201cI am never letting him off the lead again,\u201d Maya said, while clipping and unclipping like a person who learns by repeating. \u201cExcept I am, because he deserves to be a person at a field. I\u2019m trying to be someone who doesn\u2019t live entirely in fear and also I\u2019m buying a better clip.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will cultivate caution that looks like grace,\u201d Eddie said. \u201cIt\u2019ll suit us. How\u2019s the dissertation?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn organism,\u201d she said. \u201cIt eats hours and produces vague pride. It will be submitted and then I will have to invent new ways to be disciplined because the world refuses to put tape on the floor. You were good, by the way. My mum cried and my dad blamed onions and we don\u2019t own onions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send them a bag,\u201d he said. \u201cWith instructions.\u201d\n\nThey walked, because walking is one of the better ways to keep a good night from tipping out too fast. The Minster receded as if it were ducking behind a tree for a minute and would pop out later to pick up a conversation. The streets knew them and their feet knew the seams in the stone. People nodded without invading, which is one of the local arts. A man with a hat that did not suit him tried to sell them something that had started life as a candle and changed its mind, and Jules bought it because he is an idiot for things that flicker and the man smiled with all his teeth like it was Christmas at last.\n\nBack at the flats, the hallway smelled of those incense sticks the woman in 1A burned when her boyfriend stayed over, as if she were instructing the air to be civilised. Tom\u2019s door had post tucked behind the handle and the sound of nothing behind it. Maya took a deep breath that put steadiness into the corridor. Eddie bent to untie his shoes and the knee did its objection and then backed out of the argument; it would be fine in the morning if he didn\u2019t do stairs like a foal. He took the suit jacket off carefully and hung it in the way of someone who had learned to respect fabric because fabric had made him feel like a different version of himself and deserved reciprocity.\n\nThe green biscuit tin waited on its shelf without sentiment, and he opened it to slide in the programme from the service, the paper having collected a small thumb smudge of wax that made it feel like it belonged on the shelf rather than in a shoebox. He didn\u2019t take out the golden card, not because he didn\u2019t think about it but because that night had taught him that some brightnesses fade well and some you have to turn away from so you can see another kind. He put the lid on and the tin did its little sigh, a domestic amen.\n\nSleep came like a coat put on wrong and then adjusted. He dreamt he was in the school hall and the tape at the floor had been peeled up by a child for reasons of curiosity and he asked where it had gone and a voice he could not place said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need it, love,\u201d and he woke without the little panic that usually arrives when something is missing. He lay and listened to the building do its pipes song and felt the immediate, sweet tiredness of the well-used. The Christmas service sat in him like a heavy, pleasant book closed neatly and returned to the shelf.\n\nIn the morning he did the breakfast of a man who remembers he has a body and can\u2019t always treat it like an afterthought. He made himself porridge because oats are both economy and wisdom and put honey on because he had earned sweetness and because it went well with the Minster\u2019s echo still wandering around his ribs. The phone sat under its tea towel like a bird with no need to sing and he left it there, not in sacrifice but in choice. Outside, the city began another day with buses pretending to be patient and the river doing its loyally slow thing. He tucked his scarf in properly and headed for school with the particular pleasure of a person returning to his tools.\n\nThe hall waited, the tape absent and not missed. He stood anyway where he stood, out of habit and love, and sang one line into the empty morning because empty rooms are greedy and the song does not mind being shared with plaster and ancient chewing gum. The building accepted his offering and gave him back the familiar small echo that said, carry on. He checked the toilets, the Year 3s\u2019 flushes doing their shy squeal, and patted the cistern like a horse that responds to kindness better than to kicks. He moved chairs in sevens, the number still pleasing for reasons he could no longer explain, and then went to find Jules to tell him a very long story about very short candles.\n\nBetween Carol service and January, the adverts man phoned twice and left messages that used the word leverage as if it were a spice. Eddie listened to the first one and left the second to sit as a reminder that he was choosing. He met the studio man above the bakery and listened to mixes while steam rose off morning buns like souls. They talked about whether to put the Minster song on the record as a live track and decided not to, not because it wasn\u2019t good but because it was a moment and moments should sometimes keep their own dates. He went to his father\u2019s house on a Tuesday again and found the lawn under frost like a sheet with patterns and the hedge dignified by the cold and the kettle clicked into life as if the house were pleased to see him.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve he didn\u2019t go anywhere that required confetti. He went to the King\u2019s Arms for an hour and sang a song that wasn\u2019t seasonal and told the room that the song didn\u2019t know or care about dates and none of them argued. He went home early with Jules, both carrying paper bags like respectable men in a comedy sketch, and they ate sausage rolls at the table while listening to the city attempt to be excited about fireworks in the damp. At midnight, when the flats all did their variable versions of celebration\u2014one shout, two bangs, a woo from down the road, a fox\u2019s opinion\u2014he made the small wish of a person who has learned to distrust big ones. He wished for the continued ability to be of use. He added, privately, a wish from his mother that she would have wanted to see him add even if she didn\u2019t believe in wishing: let me step a little further out, without falling off.\n\nJanuary came in work boots and Eddie put his head down and carried, because that is how you survive the month that pretends to be improvement and often turns out to be endurance. The children returned with stories of grandparents and selection boxes and negotiations with screen time and he listened like a man being entrusted with the keys to small countries. He drew a snowman on the staffroom board and refused to let anyone erase it until March. He said yes to the hospice again, and no to the soap, and yes to a school in a village with a hall that smelled like mice and old panto wigs and taught a group of ten-year-olds that their bodies were trumpets whether or not they\u2019d ever want to use the metaphor in public.\n\nOn a Thursday afternoon, halfway through taking down a display of snowflakes that were never as pretty on paper as they had been in imagination, he received a letter in an envelope with confident corners. It was from the council, asking him if he would consider being part of a small project to record local songs and voices for an archive, to be listened to by people not yet born who might want to know what it sounded like here when people had accents like rivers and postcodes like statements. He stood in the corridor and read it twice and the second time he thought of his mother\u2019s laugh and his father\u2019s \u201cgood lungs\u201d and Jules\u2019 \u201cI gravy you\u201d and Maya\u2019s \u201cI am a plate with a chip\u201d and Mrs Pennington\u2019s \u201cnot during a fire drill\u201d and the little Year 1 who had saved him from falling off. He thought of Pickle\u2019s bark and the sound the hall made when you sang to it while it was empty. He thought of the Minster taking his note and lending it to the ceiling. He folded the letter like a precious thing and put it in the pocket where he kept mints and vows.\n\nOn the way home he clipped the lead to Pickle\u2019s collar himself, not for lack of trust in Maya who had mastered the art with a competence that made him proud, but because his hand wanted to feel the solid click and because the sound of it made a small, good line in his day. The dog waited, sat, lifted a paw, and Eddie shook it with all the solemnity such rituals deserve. They took the long route towards the river, avoiding the place where cars scythed in a hurry, learning together that you can choose safer and still find adventure. The city did the January thing of failing to commit to weather and he loved it for its indecision. He hummed something that had been a carol once and would be a lullaby now, and the dog looked back with a soft question that he answered with a whistle. The water slid by like someone doing their best without making a song and dance about it. He thought about the tape on the hall floor that wasn\u2019t there anymore and the line he had carried inside himself and how it had moved without anyone else\u2019s permission except his.\n\nHe went home and wrote a list because lists are how he convinces himself that life can be arranged. The tops of the list were sensible: new mop head, PAT test dates, ask Mrs P about budget for paint. The middle items were honest: visit Dad on Tuesday, no to adverts for a bit, ring Lorna and tell her about the Minster because she will want to know even though it\u2019s not her show. The bottom was foolish as all the best bits of lists are: keep the hall open late on Fridays once a month and let people sing if they want, call it something that sounds like a warm biscuit, maybe charge a pound for tea to stop them feeling guilty. He circled the foolish bit because sometimes circling is the first step in telling yourself you mean it.\n\nThat night, when he lay down, he felt the fatigue of someone who had carried the right things. He could feel in his bones the shape of the Minster, the curve of the school hall, the width of the corridor where the dog ran and didn\u2019t die, the length of the bus to his father\u2019s kitchen. He closed his eyes on a world that, if you looked at it on a map, would seem small, but which, lived properly, had the complexity of orchestras and plumbing. He slept, and dreamed, and in the dream there was music and there was tape and there were chairs in sevens, and there was the sound he had been making since he was a boy and didn\u2019t know what to call it, and for once he let it be without pushing it into usefulness. In the morning he would get up and make porridge and check flushes and carry chairs and answer questions and say no and say yes and put his hand on a dog\u2019s head and sing a line to a room made of varnish and good intentions. He would step forward when the room asked him to and step back when it needed him to listen. He would keep his lungs ready. He would tidy as he went. He would make, in the small place he had been blessed with, a sound that ran around the room and came back to where he stood.",
