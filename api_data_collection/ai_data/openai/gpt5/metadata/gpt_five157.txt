The morning the apes marched, the city sang with hard metal and old breath.

Drums came first. Skin over hollow log, thump-thump, a heartbeat rolling up the boulevards that used to be trolley lines, through tangle streets where vines claimed the old light posts and feral laundry flapped like flags. After drums, the clack of spear-hafts—stone sharpened, metal bound, cunning knapped points catching the cloud-splintered sun. And then the throats, those rope-thick muscles under fur and scar, opening to shape round notes that slid in a spiral along the buildings’ chipped façades. The notes were old, and too large to be kept inside one throat. They belonged to the city, to the trod of many feet, to squash ripe beneath stall tables and tea steam and someone somewhere weeping because a child had broken a jar that had once belonged to a grandmother with silver teeth.

Bibi Marten’s job was to mind the broken jars.

“I should be at my desk,” Bibi said, elbowing past a woman selling sugared tubers who had painted her cheeks with river clay. “I should be reviewing vendor permits. There’s a backlog. Have you seen the backlog, Edda?”

Edda, who had long, clever fingers and kept them full of rings so Bibi would mind them less and never ask questions about why they smelled like burnt resin, shrugged one shoulder. “The world will end without your approvals,” Edda said, leaning back against her stall. Beneath her, a tiny wind-up fan whirred itself weary. “Buy a twist. Extra salt. For courage.”

Bibi produced a coin and didn’t notice which. That was Bibi’s way: the coin happened, the stall happened, the smile happened, and something in the mechanism of the city—a hinge here, a latch there—turned on a hair smoother for a quick time. Busy. Busy body. “If I don’t watch the generals, they’ll knock over half this street with those banners,” Bibi muttered. “And someone will have to file a claim. And I will find it under all the other someones.”

“You think you watch the generals,” Edda said, amused. She shook a cone of fried tubers into a handkerchief and swaddled it like a baby. “You think you do a lot of watching.”

“I know I do,” Bibi said. “It’s practically a job description. We watch, we note, we route. We observe and we advise. We keep this ship from punching itself to splinters on a reef of errors.” Watching the first spear-tip of the cohort appear around the curve of Weaver’s Way, Bibi stuffed tuber into mouth, chewed, and then remembered to breathe as heat and salt and oil filled a chest already tight with the drums.

They were the Koru, the fighting apes, each one a different constellation of scars and beads and careful plaits. They had rules—more rules than Council—and if you broke them they would ignore you until you died, which sometimes was worse than a spear. Some had keening red pigment smeared over their cheekbones and some had white ash worked into the fur at their wrists, but all of them sang. The singing had words, but you couldn’t hear them unless you knew a name.

“Koru Redmane, Koru Thornback,” Bibi said under breath. Names learned from memos and gossip and an old picture book with smudged watercolor tails. Bibi knew the names of the cohorts the way a baker knows the temperature of an oven with a hand held inside the heat. The column that came was Redmane, and at its center, on a palanquin built of knotted ropes woven strong as bone and carried by young shoulders that would carry everything one day, sat General Orun.

Orun’s fur, once the color of chestnut shells, had greyed along the muzzle and temples, the way mountains frost. He wore a collar of carved seedpods that clicked softly when he moved. His eyes, dark under heavy brow, scanned the crowd and missed little. He was not tall as the tallest of his troop, but when he lifted one hand, the spears made a soft, collective sound as their tips tapped together—a dancer’s toe as it touches and then springs.

It sounded like the last note of a song you didn’t know you’d been hearing until it was gone.

“He looks tired,” Bibi said, because it seemed like an observation no one else would say aloud in a city of tourists and bravado. “He looks like he wants a nap.”

“He wants your job,” Edda said, laughing. “He wants to watch and route and advise.”

“Don’t joke,” Bibi said. “If he came to the Ministry, he would take one look at the stacks on my desk and set fire to them. And then he would be right. And I would be unemployed, which would be good for the logistics of my linen closet. But terrible for my nerves.”

A child, not more than seven, broke from her mother and ran toward the palanquin with a wreath of woven reeds. Three young warriors reached without looking to catch the child with the gentleness of musicians handling a flute. One of them—teenage, skinny, with pink-tipped ears—leaned to murmur something in the child’s ear, and the child’s lips shaped the words back, and then she stepped back and made the sign. The young warrior nodded. The child’s mother dragged her back by the wrist and pretended to scold, eyes wet.

“Tell me the rumor, then,” Edda said, because Bibi had been fidgeting the way a dog does when it knows something is happening behind a door.

“I’m not telling you anything,” Bibi said. “It’s confidential. It’s classified. It’s outrageous. It’s above my pay grade.”

“Precisely,” Edda said. “Tell.”

Bibi leaned closer to the fold of canopy and the smell of palm oil and clove. “They’re going to dissolve the Council of Nine,” Bibi whispered into the sugared steam. “There’s nothing left in the coffers. Smoke. A letter. Three moths. No one trusts anyone. They’ll appoint an Interim Voice.”

Edda’s rings clinked. “Voice,” she repeated. “The world loves a throat.”

“They call it the World Larynx now,” Bibi said. “Main broadcast, main law. Anything that goes through it becomes binding. And the apes—someone says the apes will only heed an order that is sung.”

Edda glanced at the cohort. “They’ve always sung to war and to sleep,” she said. “What changes is who they let into the room.”

“And the lottery,” Bibi said, the word sour on the back of tongue. “They’ll choose the Interim Voice by proxy lot. People submit names. People are people.”

“So people will submit your name,” Edda said cheerfully. “You have a mouth that can trip a horse. Also, no one would believe you don’t want to be in charge, which is the funny thing, because you don’t.”

“I don't,” Bibi said, insulted by how true that was. “I like my desk. I like my route stamps. I like to collect. The thing about being in the middle is you can touch everything but you don’t have to hold anything.”

Edda put the cone of fried tubers into Bibi’s hand, so that Bibi would have to hold something anyway. “Eat,” she said. “Also, stop saying dissolve like it’s sugar. It’s bone. Bone that turns to wet. It smells.”

If the day had ended with drums and fried tubers and dry jokes, that would have been enough. But Bibi’s job was to be the hinge, and hinges feel every door.

Midway down Weaver’s Way, a knot formed in the crowd. Not a fight yet. Not a festival dance. Something like a bubble of breath held in a chest too long. The warriors’ singing hit the bubble and quivered. Two lines of Redmane were about to pass a bar called the Ten Toes, which had not paid its entertainment tax in six months and whose owner, Taln, had a temper and a loud cousin prone to chants against the jungle regiments. The cousin was on the boardwalk with a hand drum the size of an old hat and a smile meant to be nothing. He started a rhythm that wasn’t the rhythm the cohort used to turn a corner. He wasn’t singing their song. He wasn’t making a joke. He was intruding, and in a culture of rules, intrusion matters.

Bibi didn’t think. Sometimes this was Bibi’s strength. Sometimes it was a shovel at a porcelain shelf.

“Stop,” Bibi said, but the word turned to breath and got tangled in the wool of a woman’s shawl. “Excuse me. No, I have—excuse me.” Bibi climbed a pepper crate, then the lip of a kiosk where someone was selling carved whistles. “Don’t make me come over there in an official capacity!”

The young Redmanes closest to the Ten Toes shifted their spears from vertical to slanted across the chest: a posture like a fence. The cousin, whose name Bibi knew but could not remember because adrenaline turns names into birds, beat the drum a syllable more to say I can. A boy in a window above the street put his fingers into his mouth to whistle a fox-spine shriek. A dog barked at the note. Someone laughed. Someone else took a breath to scream. The breath caught.

General Orun lifted his hand as if to take the rim of a cup.

“Please,” Bibi said. The word landed like a coin lost between boards. “You there. You’re not licensed for public performance in municipal procession zones. I have the form for that. If you insist on continuing, I will have to—”

General Orun, in a voice that sounded like an old kettle, said, “Let the mouth speak.”

The cousin blinked. He seemed young suddenly, or maybe very old. “I have a right,” he said, softer now. “It’s always rights until the stick comes down. I saw my brother’s blood in the brickwork two winters ago when they cleared the square. He fell on his head. They said he slipped.”

“That’s slander and history,” someone said behind Bibi, and someone else said the same two words like an echo in a corridor: slander and history.

Bibi had the sensation of being small. The apes’ singing hung in the air like a backdrop for a puppet show that was not a show at all. The cousin’s drum hesitated. Bibi felt the second before a dog either bites or licks. Time is full of these seconds. It never says so.

Bibi said, “I have a better beat.”

The words left their mouth before they had decided to trust them. Somewhere behind the kiosk, a bird with a blue head hopped twice and cocked an eye at this madness, and then hopped again because madness is just another weather.

“You,” Edda said, sounding like she was swallowing a laugh and a prayer. “Bibi, no.”

Bibi clapped—the ancient equipment. Hand to hand. Skin to skin. Out of time at first, because Bibi’s rhythm ran on ink and coffee and the crinkling shuffle of paper, not on the roll of spine and shoulder. The soldiers’ song had its own grid, and the cousin’s drum thread wove wrong in it. Bibi clapped on two, then four, then found the first. The old parade melody was in Bibi’s throat because everything in the city fell into Bibi’s throat. Everybody’s frustrations. Everybody’s missing cats. Everybody’s unfiled forms. It wasn’t much to move an army, but it could hold a room.

“Two-three—” Bibi said, and then sang the line they always played for the turning of summer markets, when the pineapples came in like stars: “Sail, sail, turn your face to the rain—”

It wasn’t the soldier’s call. It didn’t have the right vowels. It didn’t press into the chest with enough heel. But it moved. It moved the cousin because he smiled despite himself and fell onto the beat as if it were a raft he had been trying to stand on with the wrong foot first. And the young Redmanes at the fence tilted their spears upright again and, because they were apes and not statues, they began to hum along. The line compressed. The bubble popped. The marching turned the corner. General Orun lowered his hand half an inch. The hard part of the day laid itself down.

Orun looked up at Bibi. It was not a smile. It was that other thing he did with his face when a grunt or a bird flicker in the canopy told him more than ten lesser men could with polished words. He saw. He filed. He acted.

He pointed. His second, Kettu, a compact female with rings in her ear cartilage and a scar like a white vine down one bicep, climbed a storefront with the ease of someone who had never met a knee she didn’t love. In a breath that made Bibi dizzy just to consider it, Kettu stood on the kiosk with Bibi, toes gripping the edge, close enough that Bibi could smell nut oil and something sharp like crushed grass.

“You have audacity,” Kettu said. Her voice was higher than Bibi had expected. “And mouth.”

“I apologize,” Bibi said, though Bibi did not. “I was only trying to—”

“Trying to keep the hinge from squealing,” Kettu said. She looked Bibi up and down the way you would look at a new tool that might be useful if you learned the trick of it. “You organize. You count. You sing.”

“Not really,” Bibi said. “I shouldn’t have—”

“You sang,” Kettu said, as if correcting a record. “Come down before you fall. I do not want to fill out a form for a broken human.”

Bibi came down. The crowd surged, and as crowds do, it spilled into the place where it hadn’t been permitted before. The cousin with the drum made himself small and slid into a doorway. The Ten Toes’ shutters rattled closed, and someone inside pulled down a bar. The apes moved on. The city’s breath started again in hiccups.

“You saved a riot,” Edda said, handing Bibi a cup of hot tea that had not existed a moment ago. “And not for the first time,” she added.

“It wasn’t a riot,” Bibi said. “It was a crease.”

“Mm,” Edda said. “Some creases are rifts.”

Bibi went to work. When you play with the hinge, the door still expects you to hold it while everyone passes through.

The Ministry of Customs occupied a building that had once been an opera house and, before that, a railway post. The result was that filing cabinets were shaped like tubas and the post slots that had once sorted parcels across the continent were now labeled QUARRIED STONE, BEE PRODUCTS, and UNCLASSIFIED CEREMONIAL ITEMS. On the mezzanine, where ladies had once held fans and pretended to faint at high Cs, papers moved by hooks along wires, clacking as if they had opinions. Bibi slipped into the desk like a hand into a glove that had held a hundred other hands. There was a stain like a continent on the blotter. Bibi had never tried to make it go away. You don’t erase maps.

On the nearest in-tray lay three anonymous memos stamped with the Ministry’s old seal: a harp inside a shell. Someone, years ago, had straightened the lyre strings so they would align with the railway tracks behind. Someone else had added a stylized ape head in profile to the shell. Another someone had scrawled a moustache on the ape, which now had been nearly wiped off from so many thumbs.

Bibi read. The first memo was a complaint about street vendors selling drums without permits. The second was a list of song fragments overheard in the north quarter, notated in crackly ink and clearly written by someone who did not know how to notate, which made it better—breath marks where there should be none, a fixed key that wobbled with weather. The third was out of place; the third should not have been Bibi’s at all. It belonged in Executive. It was stamped with a watermark that pulsed faintly when the page was tilted to the right light. It read: Proposal for Interim Larynx. Underneath, in someone’s breezy hand: Pending lottery. Consider unorthodox.

Bibi flipped it. A name list had been started, and then scratched out. Below a line that read “We require someone with a voice that carries across difference,” someone had written, Is this joke. Below that, in a tidier hand: There’s a rumor Redmane will not recognize a Voice who cannot make the Old Call.

Bibi felt dizzy. The Old Call. The melody Bibi had used was not the Old Call. Bibi knew that. Bibi had heard the Old Call once, at a near distance, when Orun had stood on a stone slab to end a street battle too long for winter daylight and he had sung one note and held it until you could feel the air between your eyes and your skull bones become a thin blue thread, and then you were quiet because silence had changed your teeth.

Bibi put the memos down. Bibi breathed shallowly, because breathing too deep might draw something in that would stick forever.

The studio was not supposed to be a studio.

At the back of the building, under the mezzanine and behind a locked gate that had once held baggage trolleys, a narrow corridor led to what had once been a mail-bag storage, brick vaulted, always the temperature of the river at dusk. Bibi had always thought the corridor smelled like damp wool and lemon. Today it smelled like hot metal, and the faint sweet stink of electricity that leaks when someone has patched a thing with the wrong wire. Bibi had a key. Bibi had keys to many places, which is what happens when you are the hinge.

“Hello,” said a man with a voice like a paper cut. “You’re listing on the right.”

“I am not listing,” Bibi said, and then realized they were leaning visibly toward one shoulder. They straightened. “I tripped on a box.”

“No, you tripped on power,” said the man. He wore a silk scarf that used to be a curtain in the opera, dyed Minotaur blue. He had a knee that clicked audibly when he bent it. On a stool behind him rested an object that was mostly microphone and partly altar. He was Helion Moth, who had produced the last human pop song that had mattered, which had been five years ago, which might as well have been a century.

“I don’t sing,” Bibi said, because one of the ways to fend off Helion Moth is to say the opposite of what he believes you will say.

“No one sings until they do,” Helion said. “And then they can’t stop. Sit. I heard a story from a woman who smells like palm oil and mischief that my favorite civil servant stood on a box this morning and clapped a city into a better rhythm.”

“Mischief,” Bibi said, thinking of Edda. “I am not your favorite.”

“Everyone lies. Sit,” Helion repeated, and Bibi sat on a crate of Unclassified Ceremonial Items that carried a franking mark from three borders ago. When Helion turned a dial, a red light bled into life. “I have been making a map,” Helion said. “Of how things fall apart. The last song that mattered—do you remember it?”

Bibi did. It started with air whistling through a bottle, and then the sound of three palms, and then a hymn that was about water and felt like smoke. It had been illegal for forty-two days. Then it had been legal for two months. Then it had been irrelevant. “It is a problem of format,” Helion said now. “The city is busy. The apes are rhythmic. The Council is dead. If you release something to the underground, it dissipates. If you release it to the towers, it becomes law. These are the two channels. The third is gossip, which is not different from the first.”

“I do not want to release anything,” Bibi said. “I want to approve invoices.”

“Good,” Helion said. “Clean people make dirty things better. The Old Call,” he said, and Bibi’s spine went rigid. “You heard it?”

“Once,” Bibi said. “From a very close distance, which is to say in my bloodstream.”

“I have been collecting fragments,” Helion said, moving his hand through air like a conductor not sure where to set his baton. “A radio in the hills that picked up something. A ceremony song from Thornback that shares a skeleton. A fisherman who swears his father used to hum something when storms set anchor. It is not the whole thing. We can’t release the Old Call. It belongs to the apes and to war and to sleep. But there might be a shape around it, a cousin. Something that carries the capability to make everyone’s throat soften for one moment.”

“You want me to sing it,” Bibi said, and it wasn’t a question. “Helion. I have a filing deadline. Also, my voice is not. It isn’t.”

“I want you to try. If your voice breaks, that becomes part of the song. Who cares. The end of the world does not care about your purity.”

“You say that like it’s a joke,” Bibi said.

“Because if I say it any other way I will cry,” Helion said gravely. He adjusted the altar-microphone. “We could put a thing into the Larynx, if we had the license. We could make a song that is a law. ‘Be kind,’ we could make it and it would sit in the chair like a judge. We could stop a brawl that is thirty years old. But the Larynx requires a Voice.”

“The Interim,” Bibi said, and the word flapped like a wet bird from their mouth. “They’ll conclude the lottery. They’ll appoint someone who likes to talk.”

“Someone will pick your name,” Helion said. “Don’t look at me like that. You are the hinge. The hinge always ends up in the story about the door. Even if it wants to be the bit of wall that no one paints. Sing, Bibi. For practice. No one will hear. Except for me. And the ghosts in the wire.”

Bibi put a hand on the cold cage of the microphone and closed their eyes. It wasn’t that Bibi believed in music the way a musician does. Bibi believed in schedules and inputs and someone’s sigh at the end of a long afternoon when the last form had slid across the right desk. If the right note could make six spears stop being fences for a breath, then maybe a larger right note could—could do something. Bibi hated maybes. Bibi swallowed and sang.

It came out thin. It came out like a stray dog squeezing through a gap and then looking back to see if anyone saw it. Helion’s eyebrow moved. Bibi tried another line. This one came out like a stone skipping. Then, thinking of Orun’s one held note that made your bones into wires and the sky into a mouth, Bibi aimed for the idea of that note, not the note itself—aimed for the feeling of being organized by something larger than you. The third try stuck.

“That,” Helion said softly. “Hold it. Now hang a word on it. No, not that word. No words that are laws yet. Hang something soft. Something body. Breath. Breath. Breathe.”

“Breath,” Bibi sang, because sometimes the things are not clever. The word went through the note and came out the other side threadbare but brighter. Bibi held it until their face got hot and their eyes watered as if wind had moved through a window that had been closed too long.

Helion turned a dial as if he were applying balm to a burn. “Again,” he said. “Again. Again.”

Bibi sang until the red light went off on its own because a power reservoir in the wall had drained and the city had decided to save itself a spark.

“Enough,” Helion said finally. “Enough for a start. Go back to your desk. Expect nothing. Expect everything. Don’t pick up the phone if it rings and you don’t want to be who you are when you pick it up.”

The phone rang that evening. Bibi didn’t pick it up. Then the door outside the Ministry opened, and Edda slid in, and behind her slid Kettu with a grin like a knife scratched on glass.

“You’re wanted,” Kettu said. “Your name floated up. I don’t know how; I don’t care how. The lottery is a sieve and sometimes the good fish get tangled in gauze. The Interim Larynx assembly wants to hear something. We need to know if you can carry a shape.”

“A shape,” Bibi said, because the words don’t make sense when you first hear them. “I am not a singer.”

“You sang this morning and stopped blood,” Kettu said. “You did a thing that not-singers can’t do. Also, the elders love a story. Busy person speaks to drum. The city opens. Come. Or don’t. The door will be there either way. It may close.”

Edda took Bibi’s hand. “It’s always the thing you never said yes to,” she murmured, but it was kind. “It’s always the thing that pretends you’ve already chosen.”

The assembly hall was not the old Council chamber because the Council chamber had been corrupted by a leak in the ceiling and a scandal in the wall. This was a circular room down near the waterline that had been built for the purpose of shouting across echo. Now it had been rigged with a crude sound net that fed into a horn the size of a grown horse’s ribcage: the Larynx. Someone had polished it until you could see yourself in it, and Bibi didn’t want to, not now.

There were eight chairs set in a half-circle for the core committee, and the ninth chair empty and paradoxically the most occupied thing in the room. Overly tall men in very careful shirts stood near it with their mouths trying to be small. A woman with a pin shaped like a hammer sat and chewed the pin’s stem. On the far side, two Redmane elders, Orun among them, with their hands resting lightly on their own knees like cats who know which window will open first.

Helion was there, for some reason, in the second row, pretending to be less bright than he was by wearing brown. He winked with one half of one eyelid, which meant he was terrified.

“Candidate,” someone said from the committee, and Bibi realized the word was meant for them. “Your name appears twice in the lot holder’s ledger. This usually disqualifies. This time we call it confirmation.”

Bibi opened their mouth to say I am not, I never, this is a mistake. Instead, they said, “I have notes. I have memos. I have maps. I didn’t come to sing.” Then, because something in the room demanded it, they took a breath and looked at General Orun.

He did not nod. He did not look away. He had the face of a person who had outlived a hundred faces of other people and had learned how to be patient with the next one.

“I am not a pretty voice,” Bibi said to him, as if he had asked. “I am a voice that routes other voices.”

Orun made the tiniest gesture, which might have been the yes that sits in the back of a no.

The Larynx waited with a mouth that could swallow a command and spit it across mountains. Kettu stood at one side of it with her hands on her thighs. The sound net hummed faintly, the way rain does three streets away. The room smelled like water pipes and formal wear and a ghost of strawberries from someone’s perfume intended to say I am not nervous.

“Make a sound,” the woman with the hammer pin said. “We need to know if the thing that happened in the market was story.”

It would have been possible to say no. It would have been possible to walk out the door and go back to a desk where a stain did not erase maps, and an in-tray held three memos and a poem someone had slipped into the wrong place. It would have been possible to say, there are others. It would have been possible to name them. Names predicated on courage not bound to the hinge. Bibi had them ready. They were good names.

Instead, Bibi lifted the chin the way their grandmother had taught them when you needed to take in more sky. “Breath,” Bibi sang—just the word, just like Helion had said, the shape around the thing. The first note fell out, and the room rearranged itself slightly, the way a room does when you open a window and a paper on a table moves an inch. It wasn’t the Old Call. But Orun’s head tilted, and Kettu’s eyes widened, and Helion’s eyelid stuttered. Bibi held the note and put on it a memory of the morning’s drums, and the smell of sugared tubers, and the way the child whispered a soldier’s secret name like a prayer she would put back where it belonged after she had looked at it. Then they hung a second word on the note, soft, reluctant. “Stay,” Bibi sang. Then: “Please.”

The Larynx took the note and turned it loosely in its throat the way a cook turns soup that is on the verge of too much. Out beyond the hall, in a street where a cartwheel had stuck in a rut and two men were like to shout about who had made the rut, the shout deflated without meaning to. In an alley where two cats were coiled to clash for a fish head, they looked at each other like the object had grown legs and walked away; they backed down. In a tenement room where a child had been about to take a peppermint from a tin that did not belong to her, she still took it, but put another small thing in its place. The note went to five neighboring blocks and nowhere else because the sound net was a shoestring and had frays.

General Orun took his hand off his knee—lightly, lightly—and put it on the floor. The floor seemed to consent. Orun said, “It carries.”

The woman with the hammer pin sat back. A man in a careful shirt rubbed the sleeve with his thumb slowly like a person thinking of removing a stain. Someone laughed, almost. Then someone else stamped a paper. The ninth chair did not fill. That would take ceremony, it would take the reading of codes written when there were still railways running, and it would take the apes’ acknowledgement, which came not through chairs but through shared heat and breath and battle song. But there was a nod. There were three signatures. There was a door opening by a hair.

Bibi stood very still. In their chest, their heart had decided to do that thing it did sometimes where it beat like Bach, then like a street fight, then like something else that people couldn’t agree on.

“Interim,” someone said, and the sound hit Bibi’s cheek. “Voice.”

The city had always loved a joke. The joke now was that the person who had wanted never to be the part people looked at had become the throat of the room.

Afterward, when the hall had held enough applause to pretend the choice had not been made before it was made, Bibi found themselves in the corridor outside the Larynx room with Helion and Kettu and someone who had entirely too much glitter on their collar and who Bibi did not know but who knew Bibi’s name and had the calculating friendliness of a person from money who wants to be from a story. Bibi felt the world trying to rearrange around them. Bibi wanted very badly to put everything back where they had taken it from.

“You don’t have to accept,” Helion said softly, and this was an untruth he told for kindness.

“You should accept,” Kettu said briskly, which was cruel and true. “Better a hinge than a wall pretending to be a door.”

The stranger with glitter smiled a full set of teeth. “We can make your song go everywhere,” they said. “We can put it into every street horn and every kitchen pipe. We just have to pass one more minor vote, and then you can speak and they have to hear. Think—any law you like, if it rhymes people will sign it in their sleep.”

“I am not writing laws in rhyme,” Bibi said, horrified. “And I am not—this is not a song. It’s a—”

“It’s shape,” Helion offered. “An architecture of air. Bibi, it might keep the lid on a pot until someone hardier gets here with a spoon. Or it might become the spoon itself. I don’t know. I do know if the lottery chose you, it is because the city has a sense of humor and an ear.”

General Orun appeared without sound, which should not be possible for someone that size, but he had the habit that old soldiers have of moving within the thickness of a room. Kettu straightened. Helion turned his knee so it wouldn’t click. The glitter-collar person smiled harder, as if it could work like armor.

“You carried a word,” Orun said, looking at Bibi’s throat. “If you cannot sing the Old Call, then do not try to sing it. It is an old thing. It has its own teeth. It is not for law. It is for war and for sleep. But if you can carry crowd breath and give it back softened, then you may find yourself doorkeeper to a hard winter. We will not kneel. We do not kneel. But we will listen for a moment.”

“I don’t want anyone to kneel,” Bibi said. “I want people to drink water and pay vendors and not cut cats. I want—”

“To be busy,” Kettu said, dry and fond. “The world has handed you the biggest inbox you will ever have. Do not enjoy that too much. It will eat your hands.”

“And if I refuse?” Bibi asked, though the question was mostly shadow puppet, placed on a wall for the sake of the story.

“Then another mouth will be found,” Orun said. “And it will say yes. And the world will end anyway, or it will not, today or tomorrow or in a year. Your little refusal will be a poem someone writes and you will have to endure people saying ‘how principled’ while they are trampled by horses at a parade.”

Helion winced. “Oof,” he said. “My friend, you are bad at gentle.”

“I am good at war,” Orun said. “And good at sleep. The rest is for those who gossip. Bibi. Consider. We have had other Voices. Some have been good at being in the middle. Some have been good at being at the edge and shouting at wind. If you accept, you will have to release something into the Larynx to become law. It is necessary. You cannot be the Voice and say nothing. The city requires throat.”

Bibi thought of the red light going out in Helion’s studio. Bibi thought of Edda’s rings. Bibi thought of the cousin with the drum and his brother’s blood in brickwork. Bibi thought of a song that had held the city for six beats and then evaporated like sweat off a lip. Bibi thought of whoever had written “Is this joke” on the memo and whoever had written the tidy hand beneath it that said nothing at all like humor. Bibi thought of dinner. They were hungry.

“Yes,” Bibi said to Orun, to Kettu, to Helion, to the glitter-collar, to the room full of water pipes that vibrated a note no one had named. “Interim. For a while. I will accept. But if I am to put a thing into the Larynx, it will not be a command. It will be a song. Not the Old Call. Something else. Something between teeth and ink.”

“So,” Helion whispered in quick excitement. “We will need to finish it. We will need to get into the Larynx. We will need the rhythms of the cohorts and the market bells. We will need—”

“We will need permission,” Kettu said. “We do not do law songs without formal pieces of paper and braiding. You will come to Redmane. You will hear and you will not repeat, and you will be given a borrow of a note. One note. That is all we lend.”

“Thank you,” Bibi said, which felt like the formal shape that fits around a terror compact enough to carry.

“Don’t thank me,” Kettu said. “I do not have the authority to lend you anything but my footsteps.”

“Then thank your General,” Bibi said, turning to Orun, who had already turned as if to indicate that the conversation was over, but who now stopped and looked back as if someone had called his name in a voice he did not expect.

“It is not about thanks,” Orun said. “Thank the rain. Thank the drummer’s cousin. Thank the hinge.”

He left. Kettu followed. The glitter-collar person took out a little mirror and fixed their mouth. Helion put his hand on the wall as if to steady the building.

“Congratulations, Interim,” Helion said. “You get to save us all with a pop song that isn’t a pop song and a law that isn’t a law.”

“Don’t be melodramatic. Please,” Bibi said, but the laughter that followed the word had a wobble in it. “We need a title,” they added recklessly, because one of the ways to keep from falling down a well is to continue to talk. “We need a hook.”

“We will steal the end of the oldest song and make it quiet,” Helion said. “We will sing, even if we have no choice. We will call it—don’t glare—We will call it Endling.”

“That is awful,” Bibi said, and wanted to cry, and did not.

“It will sell,” Helion said. “To whom,” he did not say, because what does selling mean when law is a broadcast and ethics are printed on posters like recipes for soup. “Edda will love it. That is my metric.”

The next morning, Bibi went to Redmane. Edda made sure Bibi’s collar was flat. “Don’t look for the Old Call,” she said into the fabric. “You will see it anyway. Then look somewhere else.”

They went across the bridge that used to be train track, now repurposed as a walkway with plantings of hardy succulents in the places where people had stolen the brass plaques, and they went into the green that still had birds, low ones that had learned how to sing in a key that didn’t bother the apes. Koru Redmane’s training circle was a clearing ringed by stones polished by generations of backs. Kettu met them with a coconut bowl of water, which Bibi took and did not drink because the first sip would be noted. Bibi poured a splash on each palm. Kettu made a small approving sound.

Old ones gathered. Young ones stood at the perimeter and made faces when they thought Kettu wasn’t looking. Orun came last. It made your skin go prickly when he arrived, as if someone had opened a pantry and the smell of old fruit and rope came out.

“We lend you one note,” Orun said without preamble. “Not the note. An adjacency.”

“I will return it,” Bibi said, reflex.

“You cannot return notes,” Orun said. “They lodge or they pass through. But I appreciate the shape of your mind.”

A woman older than Orun—fur thin along the ribs, eyes like storm water, beadwork flashing—lifted her hand and drew a circle in the air. The circle was not nothing. Bibi stared because one should when a person draws in air and the air remembers. She hummed, and it was ugly in the way honest things are. The hum held a jagged, worn edge where a tooth had been. It snagged in Bibi’s throat just to hear it. It made everything else in the clearing quieter by measure. Bibi knew it was not the Old Call. It was a key kept under a rock.

“Carry,” the woman said.

Bibi lifted their chest, thought of paper, of routes, of the sonic net in the Larynx, of Helion’s hands, of Edda’s rings. They hummed the note. It did not catch. That’s the thing about notes you borrow. The first time, you drop them. The second time, the clearing is patient with you. The third time, it arrives somewhere behind your sternum and says something upside down that you have to learn to read.

They carried it. Tears came without permission. They let them. The young Redmanes had the courtesy to pretend not to see. Kettu was ethnography and pride in a single person standing. Orun looked at Bibi’s mouth like a surgeon watching a body decide to live or die mid-procedure not because of hands but because of the idea of breath.

“Good,” the old woman said finally, as if admitting to an apple that it was red. “You may go now. And when you speak to your horn, do not put a demand on the note. Make it the kind of request that would allow someone to refuse and still be your friend.”

Back across the train bridge, Bibi said, “It hurts,” and was surprised to have spoken.

“It is supposed to hurt,” Kettu said. “Fighting hurts. Sleep hurts if you do it right. Singing is both.”

“You’re very cheerful,” Bibi said.

“As they say in my family,” Kettu said dryly, “we are congenitally direct. We had our humor cut out as infants.” Then, softer: “I am proud of you.”

Bibi, unprepared, said nothing, and then said, “I am afraid.”

“Good,” Kettu said. “The people who are not afraid are extremely dangerous.”

Back at the Ministry, someone had put flowers on Bibi’s desk—marigolds, which meant cheer in some dictionaries and funeral in others. On top of the flowers lay a stack of new memos. On top of them: a note in Edda’s hand: They’re asking whether you will use the Larynx today. There is talk of a protest at the docks. The cranes have stopped moving. Do not go alone. Do not under any circumstance get yourself killed in front of the horn. It will take ages to get the stain out.

Helion, when he came in—he always came in without knocking, humming under his breath as if he could set people to similar key—said, “You can do it. Or you can wait. But if you wait you will be someone who waited.”

“I need to write the part that makes it ours and not theirs and not yours,” Bibi said. “The words. I need there to be something to sing that isn’t command. It has to ask. It has to ask like a person.”

“What would you like to ask?” Helion said.

Bibi touched the paper. The borrowed note sat between skin and wood. “Stay,” Bibi said. “Please. And also: Breathe. Together. And also: I am here.”

“And the rest will fill,” Helion said, like a recipe.

“Endling,” Bibi said, grudgingly, and then: “No. Maybe. Stop laughing.”

“I am not laughing,” Helion said. “I am vibrating in an appreciative mode. You are doing something impossible. It makes me feel itchy. The city will love you and then will throw you stones. We have time for both. It will be dramatic. It will be tedious. It will be lunchless. We should get you a snack.”

Edda brought a sandwich wrapped in yesterday’s again paper. She held Bibi’s gaze long enough to say what she would say out loud later: do not forget to come home to yourself. It is a house with windows. They hugged in the way you do when you’re trying to be quiet about it in a place where people transact the movement of authority like bread.

In the late light, they went to the Larynx. The pipe hummed. The horns on every corner in the city were set to catch. Someone had chalked slogans on the steps: VOICE IS CHOICE. NO MORE MEN WITH MOUTHS. IF YOU SING WRONG, WE WON’T. Someone had drawn a small cat licking a paw. In the harbor, the cranes loomed and didn’t shift. On the quays, workers sat on coils of rope like saints in paintings.

Bibi stepped onto the low platform that wasn’t a throne. The Larynx waited with its mouth. Bibi closed their eyes and pictured a city that held even when it was too much, and a soldier’s one held note that was the length of a season, and a person with glitter on their collar who would try to own whatever came out of this room, and a cousin with a drum who would find the beat because he could not help it, and Edda, who would turn to her neighbor and tell them the truth in five words that would sound like gossip. They took a breath. They carried the borrowed note.

“Breath,” Bibi sang. “Stay. Please. I am here.”

The Larynx took it and made it larger. The cranes in the harbor, vast birds with rusted feathers, did not move, because a song does not fix everything. But some of the men on the ropes put down their cudgels. And some of the men who had come to taunt them looked down at their hands and found them embarrassing. And a woman at a window three streets up took a bowl off a child’s head because you should not balance things on children’s heads just because they are level.

Bibi let the note fade as if it had decided on its own. You do not cut these things. You let them walk out.

Silence did a strange thing in the room. It swelled. It didn’t collapse. Then it popped like a soap bubble and ordinary sound came back: cough, heel on stone, the slide of Helion’s knee, Kettu’s throat clearing a note that might have once been a laugh. The interim committee looked at one another like people who had just voted in their sleep. General Orun, in the doorway, tilted his head at a new angle. Approval? War? Sleep? It might have been none. It might have been all.

Bibi stepped back. Someone said, “It’s done.” Someone else said, “We can draft the letter.” A third person started to cry because they had expected to feel different and did, and did not.

Outside, rain had begun in the soft, fat drops that people call donkey’s coins. Edda stood in it with her hands palm-up. When Bibi came down the steps, she made a face like a person who has eaten something very hot and very good.

“You did it,” she said, wringing her hair into her spine. “You nightmare. You did it.”

“If I had said no,” Bibi began, but Edda shook her head.

“If you had said no, someone else would have said yes. Or the same yes would have found you by another door. Come home. You will catch cold being important.”

Kettu stepped out of the Larynx hall under a gutter. “The world will not end today,” she said, and then, with irritating cheer again, “unless the dorsal fields to the west discharge lightning and hit the powder stores, in which case we will all be spiced, which would be a shame, because I have a new shirt.”

“That is a terrible thing to say,” Bibi said, laughter scaring up in the high places of their chest.

“It is, isn’t it,” Kettu agreed. “We make these bad jokes because the alternative is to think about the ways things break.”

“The hinges?” Edda said, with a look that said she would not forgive the metaphor if Kettu took it.

“The ropes,” Kettu said, surprising both. “The ropes that hold sails and hold bridges, that hold a hundred things. They fray. You take a little note and you wrap it around. It is not a fix. It is a delay. It is grace.”

Bibi felt then the heat of what had been put on them. It was not responsibility. That is a word like a brick: square, heavy, useful. It was something thinner and more dangerous, like wire. Someone would trip on it if they didn’t see it. Someone would use it to bind a wrist if they were not careful. It ran from throat to horn to street to harbor and back. It hummed.

“Let’s go home,” Edda said again, and Bibi went, because the hinge must sometimes be shut.

That night, Bibi woke twice, once from a dream in which the city was an orchestra and every desk had a bell and the bells rang as pigeons do for bread, and once because of thunder. They went to the window and leaned out into rain that felt like once and then twice and then echo. In the street below, someone was singing badly. Above, in the sky that had a habit of lying, something flickered.

Bibi thought of the memo that had asked for unorthodox. They thought of the end of a song, held just long enough to make the next breath possible. They wrote the word Endling on a scrap of paper, stared at it, and then crossed it out. They wrote Stay instead. They wrote Please. They wrote Here.

When morning came, the city was still there. The cranes had moved. Someone had drawn a cat wearing a crown on the Larynx’s base. Koru Redmane had gone to the north quarter to help load sandbags because the river, which had loved the city for a long time, had decided to swell with the same love. There were a hundred memos on Bibi’s desk. The flower had wilted. Edda’s note said: there is a man from Thornback here with a hat shaped like a bowl. He says he wants to sell you a fable. Kettu wants you at noon. Helion says he has fixed the hiss. I say eat breakfast.

Bibi ate breakfast, badly. Bibi went to work. And the first day of being Interim Voice turned into all the ordinary hours, crowded with little endings. It had the feeling of a drum beaten not steady but with gaps where the listener had to make the rhythm themselves. That is to say, it felt like life.

Somewhere in the gears, a tooth cracked. Not loud enough to hear yet. On a long enough timeline, everything sings and everything breaks. Bibi’s throat had a borrow lodged in it like a seed. The apes went to their drills. The first pop song that was not a pop song and not a law but something with teeth and ink existed in the air, if you knew where to press your ear. Helion smelled like power and silk and mischief. Orun looked up at the sky and saw a shape of weather he did not like. And a man in the north quarter who had a radio and a rat’s patience wrote down three notes that he said he had picked up from a broadcast that was not supposed to go so far. He wrote at the bottom: is this joke, and underlined it once, then twice, then, embarrassed by his own certainty, smudged it with his thumb.The man from Thornback introduced himself by taking off his hat and setting it upside down on Bibi’s blotter as if the hat were a small boat and the desk a dock. The hat was made of some stiffened leaf, lacquered until it held its sheen even in the damp light of the opera windows. Inside the bowl of it lay three tokens: a fishbone that had been carved into a comb, a bead the color of old lemon peel, and a strip of tanned hide punched with holes in a pattern that might have been rain or might have been code. He had a face like a tree that had grown around a nail and learned to live with it, and his arms had the long muscles of someone who spent time throwing lines.

“I sell fables,” he said without smiling. “Not stories. Fables. Stories have somewhere to go. Fables have teeth and return to bite. Thornback sends me as a courtesy. I would like to sell you one.”

Bibi did not pick up the tokens because some objects ask to be touched and some do not. Bibi had learned the difference at a desk. Edda, who had let the man in and now leaned on the jamb with a face that could do three kinds of neutrality at once, lifted her eyebrows the half millimeter that meant, he smells like river and trouble.

“I am not authorized to buy fables,” Bibi said. “We have a procurement list. It includes salt, string, and ink. It only includes fables under Unclassified Ceremonial Items, and those require a docket from—”

“I know where they require things,” the Thornback man said, and his mouth made the shape of a grin without performing one. “I am not interested in paper. I am interested in exchange. My fable for a hearing. My fable for a sentence in the Larynx. Not yours,” he added, and ducked his head toward Bibi’s throat. “Mine. You have seen how the law muddies when it goes through a horn. I am not asking for law. I am asking for a sound.”

Edda made a small noise with her teeth that was polite for do not. Bibi lifted a hand to quiet the noise without looking at her. “Tell me the outline,” Bibi said. “We will see if I can afford the rest.”

The man reached into the hat, touched the fishbone comb like a rosary, then left it in place and looked around the room as if habit required him to count. “In the beginning of the cohort-box,” he said, “before the Redmanes called themselves, there was Hollowsong. That is what we called the time when the apes took names from the sound of their dead and their predators and the places where children fell and did not bleed. Hollowsong is before war. Hollowsong is how a troop learns to say yes to a path without thinking about it too much.”

“We are not interested in the Old Call,” Bibi said quickly and carefully. “It is not for law. We will not mimic it. I have been told, by those who can tell me, to look away when I see it and sing something else.”

The Thornback man held up his hand, the thumb nicked and poorly stitched a dozen times. “I have no wish to be drowned by an elder’s disapproval,” he said, almost warm. “This fable is not about that. This fable says that when people started to build cities, they forgot the Hollowsong. This fable says the first city fell down because no one knew how to leave the center when the center caught fire. This fable says the hinge thought it was a lock.”

Edda stopped pretending to be neutral. “Name your price,” she said dryly. “You brought it on a plate.”

“My price,” the man said, and turned his hat slowly so that light played shallow over the lacquer, “is small and exactly the size of the hole in your door. There is a boat from Thornback waiting under the north pier. It carries nothing. It carries a box of fishing hooks and three jars of fish sauce and one empty chest. It would like to leave the city by the west gate without inspection.”

Bibi considered the hat, which was not a document. Considered Edda, who had started tilting her head the way a dog does at a whistle it cannot decide to obey. Considered the fact that in Bibi’s inbox were ten forms requesting a relaxation of tax at the docks, all of which had been left to thin. Considered the taste of power like a coin under the tongue and the shape of what happens when you put your own weight on the scale for a favor dressed as a fable dressed as a threat. “I cannot,” Bibi said. “If I open the west gate for an empty chest, I will open it for a thousand, and one of those chests will hold a thing that eats our teeth.”

“It is a pity,” the man said, and did not sound as if it were. “Then here is a courtesy. Not a fable. An outline, because you asked for one. If the city needs to move as one body to escape fire or to carry water, you cannot command it. People are stubborn; apes are worse. You have to make a circle at the center of the shape that is so loud with quiet that the outside has no choice but to turn around it. You have to let people hear themselves being part of the arc. Do not sing the Old Call. Say nothing that binds. Hum a room. If you do this, you will be able to move a crowd sideways without stepping on their pride.”

Edda’s rings clicked softly. “And Thornback gets what, for this outline,” she said, sweet as sugar left on fire until it just begins to blacken.

The man put his hands on the desk, palms flat. “Thornback gets the knowledge that when the lid is on the pot here, it is not because a lid was clapped by a hand that does not live here. Thornback does not like a lid that was cut elsewhere. You,” he said to Bibi, and for the first time something like respect bent the line of his mouth, “smell like paper and street and a song sung by a kettle left too long on. Thornback can live with that for a day. Thornback will come another day with a better hat and a heavier price.”

“You sell debts,” Edda said.

“I sell the recognition of them,” the man said, took his hat, put it on with a turn that would have made a child laugh, and left them with two pieces of lemon-yellow beadlight on the blotter and the feeling of having acquired a bill they had not agreed to.

“Why did you not throw him down the steps?” Edda asked, stopping by Bibi’s chair and putting her fingers into the marigolds, which shed orange dust like powdered sunset. “He is exactly the kind of story with legs.”

“Because he offered me a sentence he didn’t know he was offering,” Bibi said. “Hum a room,” they said under breath, to hear how it felt, and did not like that it fit into their throat with ease.

By noon the rain had gone from coins to shawls. Kettu met Bibi at the edge of the training clearing with her hair braided back so tight it made her already sharp face look like it had been honed for a specific argument with God. She had a bandage on the back of one hand where something had nipped her in the reeds. Behind her, young Redmanes ran drills that had nothing to do with fighting and everything to do with turning as a group without thinking about who had bumped whose shoulder. They made broad figures that in another life would have been court dances and in this one would be maps around barricades.

“Breathe here,” Kettu said without preamble, and put her open palm on Bibi’s belly, which made Bibi want to laugh and cry and run, because Kettu’s hand was exactly the size of the fear they were pretending not to keep. “When the water rises, people lift their voices and forget their feet. You will sing into feet. You will sing people a way to step.”

“I have never told people how to step,” Bibi said, and felt foolish because it was not true. “I send routes all day. I tell men where to carry salt so it arrives in the kitchen before the pot does.”

“You will do it with a wider pot,” Kettu said. “Helion says he has found the hiss. He says something or someone is stealing breath from the wires in the Larynx. He says you will need to carry more of your own and depend less on the walls. He says a lot. I say this: if the water comes through the market, your voice will not go far unless you make the crowd lean toward it. You have to find that leaning.”

Orun did not appear. The old woman who had lent Bibi the adjacency watched with her thin lips dragged down by gravity and disappointment and, perhaps, the weight of being right too many times. She hummed once, and the clearing shivered. Bibi carried the note back to their chest and found the place Kettu’s hand had marked. When the hum sat there, their knees stopped wanting to unravel.

“Do not make commandments,” the old woman said. “Leave room to say no.”

“The docks are spreading it around that you have a taste for telling people to stay,” Kettu said, serious. “Half of them felt it yesterday and were grateful not to break their own heads on a corner. The other half did not hear it and have decided that since they did not hear it it must have told them to do something they would have disobeyed. You will not convert the deaf. You will carry the willing. Do not bruise your song trying to bruise them.”

“Can I go five minutes without instruction,” Bibi said to Kettu, but it was light and Kettu laughed despite herself, and the laugh put a handle on the afternoon.

Helion’s studio had gained two new things by the time Bibi got there: a coil of wire that was either stolen from a radio tower or donated by it, and a cup of tea that was not theirs, which Helion was guarding like a hen with a single egg. He had removed his Minotaur scarf and replaced it with a strip of red cloth that was much cheaper and did more work. He pointed at the wall without turning when Bibi entered. A paper was pinned there that was only a sketch of a machine, circles and lines that meant bleed and gather and not enough and too much. In the corner someone had scrawled, in a hand that tried to be anonymous and failed, this is a joke and then crossed out one letter and written not.

“Who else has access,” Bibi said without greeting, because the city teaches you the value of triage. “To the underwires. To the Larynx’s throat. Who would build a siphon.”

“Everyone who thinks radio is a pet,” Helion said, and sipped his tea. “Everyone who wears shirts you cannot afford and says words like stewardship after they have eaten. A boy in the north with a rat’s patience. A person with a glitter collar whose name I am not going to remind you of because if we say it three times they appear in a cloud of corrective paperwork. A minister who is not you. A man like a stick who runs a bar called Ten Toes and has cousins who drum.”

“Stop,” Bibi said. “My head is a bell; if you hit it too hard it will crack. Which line is leaching.”

Helion pointed at a delicate curve of pencil. “There,” he said. “It is a splice made with a clothes pin and a good intention. It bleeds enough breath to carry a small broadcast if you know how to hold your mouth. Yesterday when you said stay, someone heard go. If you are going to sing, make sure your words lean together so hard they cannot be pulled apart with fingers. No one should be able to take a slice and make a weapon.”

Bibi imagined the radio man in the north with his rat patience writing down three notes and turning them into a rumor because no one had told him the joke ends. They imagined men with cudgels warming themselves to the sound of a word bent the wrong way. They imagined the apes at the flood barrier shoveling with rhythm because rhythm is a better tool than a shovel most days. The paper with the sketch made a little noise in the damp. Bibi put their hand on the paper because sometimes the only thing you can do for a plan is touch it with your stubborn.

“We have time for a test,” Helion said. “We do not. But we will take it. Say the thing you will say if the market floods and the stairs are clogged with baskets and mothers and someone drops a jar that does not break, and a man stoops to pick it up and is knocked down because he did not look up.”

Bibi closed their eyes. They carried the adjacency like a pencil balanced on the lip of a cup. “Breathe,” they sang under breath, to themselves. “Step left to the stall with green umbrellas. Step right when you smell the cinnamon. Do not push the boy with the parrot. He is small. You are large. Let your shoulders be doors. Let your elbows be pods. Do not touch someone if you can help it. If you cannot help it, say sorry with your shoulder. Say it soft. Say it once.”

Helion was already turning knobs. “Again,” he murmured, and hit a switch that made the room purr. “Again, but with the bells.”

They laid a track under the words: the note from Redmane, the sound of a hand on a portside bell, the groan of a crane from three piers over and a long time ago. Helion slapped the hiss with some piece of magic and it stopped trying to be the most important part of the room. Bibi sang until their belt was damp with sweat and their throat had the beginning of a scratch in it that would be a cough if they fed it.

“Enough,” Helion said, which meant he had just found the thread that would go through a needle. “Keep your mouth soft. Keep your please quiet. We will not use it unless we must.”

They had to.

A runner came with water on his lashes and sand on his teeth. He wore the city’s idea of uniform: two tags pinned to a shirt that might once have been white, naming him in two conflicting ways. As he leaned on the doorjamb, a drop ran down his wrist and left a clear line through the dirt. “The east market,” he said. “The river has put its elbow in. The sandbags are stacked and good, but a cart turned, and the Persimmon Gate is clogging with boxes, and there is shouting thick enough to give a child a bruise. Koru are there but there are more people than arms. They will hit each other unless someone gives them a different thing to do with their hands.”

“Helion,” Bibi said, and he was already handing them a scarf of his that he would never admit he intended for emergencies. “Kettu,” Bibi said, and did not need to say her name into the wire because Kettu had a way of being where trouble made a low noise. “Let’s go.”

The Larynx hall filled itself as if it had always lain in wait for this exact bustle. A boy with his hair racketed into lopsided braids tripped and laughed at the same time and caught a coil of rope with his ankle before it could be the end of an old woman on the stairs. Edda appeared with a basket of limes and knives and the expression of a person determined to make sandwiches at the end of the world. Kettu’s second cousin—Bibi had not known Kettu had such cousins and decided to file it for later—showed up with a drum as fasciated as a spine. The committee assembled, drawn and elliptical like chalk in rain. Orun took his place near the door and made the room quiet by letting everyone watch him refuse to be excited.

“Do not make law today,” Helion breathed into Bibi’s ear like a blasphemy. “Make a map. Stop when the map has them going where they can go on their own.”

“Stop if the Larynx stutters,” Kettu said, and touched the back of Bibi’s hand the way a fencer might touch the guard on a blade. “Stop if you hear it say a word you did not give it. We will haul the rope if the rope slips. You do not bring the rope with your teeth.”

Bibi nodded, too many times, an old habit. They held the note. The room held. They sang.

It did not feel like song. It felt like a megaphone with one good screw and one that had been chewed by a dog. It felt like the sound of silt and knees. It went out into the river air and hit the stalls where oranges were stacked like suns and women with babies strapped to their backs and men with knives who were cutting rope because cutting rope always feels like a solution in a flood. It found the Persimmon Gate and licked at the edges of the clog. It made a corner where there had been no corner and put on it a green umbrella because that was what Bibi had said and somebody, somewhere, always had a green umbrella.

“Step left,” the Larynx said with Bibi’s mouth. “Step right. Let the baskets go over your head and not through your ribcage. You are not at war. You are at water. Your shoulder knows the difference.”

For a moment, the city wore the song like a shirt that fit. Then the siphon bit.

Out at the north end, where the radio with rat patience had its wire climbing like a vine up a wall no one would notice, a spare horn on the seventh block took a slice of Bibi’s breath, squeaked it through a laundry clip, and shoved it into the air with a clatter. The word stay took a hitch. The word step got cut to a hiss and a pop. For three breaths, what was heard in a lane near the Grand Coconut was the word leave.

People hear what they fear. A woman dropped her basket and took her child by the arm so hard the child cried. A boy who had never in his life obeyed a voice from a horn obeyed this one because it sounded like his father’s old soldier bark and he ran. Two vendors started moving their tables with an urgency that made them enemies of physics. The corner that Bibi had not drawn became a mouth.

Bibi heard it, because the Larynx is a traitor as much as it is an instrument. They felt the profit of loss, the ugly part of a plan that hurts first and apologies later. Kettu saw Bibi’s mouth go white as a string pulled too tight and said in a voice that could pin a hummingbird to a page, “Don’t chase it. Sing elsewhere. Make two maps and let the city pick.”

Helion was already moving, a man made of wire and habit, weaving under the dais to the panel he had decided belonged to him. He lifted it with the familiarity of a thief. The hiss squealed. He slapped the siphon with a piece of cloth and the room smelled like burnt sugar for a second that would later be a story. He mouthed a number at Bibi that meant, give it the other hand.

“Breathe,” Bibi sang, softer now, which made it louder. “Breathe where you are. If you hear go, do not go yet. If you hear stay, stay but do not harden. We are going to lift together on three. One for the ribs. One for the baskets. One for the niña with the purple ribbon. One and then one and then one,” they sang, ruining the count on purpose, because sometimes the only way to get the crowd to move in the same rhythm is to keep them from sitting on a number like a chair.

It smoothed. The Persimmon Gate spat out a table and three fish and a toddler wearing a hat with ears. The water licked like a cat but did not lunge like a dog. The apes at the edge of the market moved as if they were part of a shape that had been drawn on the ground long before anyone thought to fill it with feet. People who had not heard anything at all did what people do when other people suddenly act as if there is a plan: they fell into place, grumbling like kettles.

Helion swore quietly in three languages when the horn hiccuped again, but this time the siphon’s mouth was full of cloth, and what it spit out into the north quarter was a wet cough that went nowhere. He made another mark on his paper with the circles. Edda appeared at the foot of the dais with limes and knives and eyes that were bright with indignation, and handed wedges to Kettu, who handed wedges to the boy with the lopsided braids, who took the whole bowl out into the rain like a herald because sometimes what you need at the end of a song is sourness in the mouth to remind you you are not asleep.

“Stop,” Kettu said in Bibi’s ear at the exact moment Bibi thought to stop. “They have the map now. Do not tell them how to go home or they will forget.”

Bibi let the note go the way you let a kite go because you can see it has decided on a tree. The room filled with sound that was ordinary and thus extraordinary: cough, slap of rag on wood, the sigh of a person who has carried a table and put it somewhere it belongs, the smartness of Edda’s hand on Bibi’s arm because she will always remind a person where their skin is.

“File the form,” someone from the committee said immediately, because the city, pressed into a good shape, always tries to pop back with paper. “Use-of-Voice Form Twelve-A. Who authorized. What words used. Whether the words resulted in—”

“In fewer broken teeth than there might have been,” Kettu said without bothering to look at the speaker. “If you write that on a form, it will be the first time truth has been written on a form in this building since it was an opera house and had words that killed women in high dresses.”

General Orun watched the door. When the last of the market sound lost its urgency and became sound again, he put his hand flat on the floor and then lifted it. He had made up his mind about something. Bibi did not know what. It is a gift to not know everything about the room when you have to stay in it.

The glitter-collar person arrived late, as such people do when they wish to have it guessed that they are here because they chose to be and not because the rain forced them. They clapped once politely. They looked at the damp on the floor as if it could be tidied by a letter. “That went very well,” they said, as if Bibi had just completed a piece of embroidery. “We should review the content for the next broadcast. We have compiled a list of words that test well in the north and do not test well in the south. Please avoid them. We have also considered a series—”

“Not today,” Bibi said, surprising themselves with a voice that sounded almost like a knife with a hilt someone had made to their hand. “Today I am going to fill out a form and eat a wedge of lime and then I am going to sit still enough that my breath comes back to me before it finds someone else. Tomorrow you can show me your words.”

The glitter-collar person recalibrated their smile. “Of course,” they said, and took a step in a direction that would be considered gracious by anyone who needed their money.

In the corner near the horn, Helion opened his mouth and shut it and opened it again like a fish learning to be a bird. “They took your word and bent it,” he said finally, as if confessing something he had done by proxy. “We will fix the bleed. Or we will not, and we will sing around it. I can make you louder. I can make you smaller. Tell me which, and I will lie to you that I can do it.”

“Smaller,” Bibi said immediately, and then laughed because they could hear Edda in their own mouth and they sounded like a person refusing cake at a funeral. “Louder next time,” they added. “But not today.”

Kettu leaned against the wall in the way that a person who has done more work than she let people see allows the weight to hold her. “You have to learn to enjoy this less than you could,” she said. “That is the only way to make it not eat you. And you did well. For a human.”

“High praise,” Bibi said, and then, because the room had emptied down to the people they wanted to trust, “I am going to be killed by a siphon. Not with knives. With a laundry clip and an intention.”

“You have friends with scissors,” Edda said. “And thieves with red scarves and old soldiers with knees that click. And a market that likes you better than it thinks it should.” She put a lime wedge in Bibi’s hand. “Also this.”

In the afternoon, when the water had agreed to be a person walking calmly down a street and not a crowd, Bibi sat with Form Twelve-A and wrote the truth in the boxes designed for something else. Authorization: necessity. Words used: breath, stay, please, here, step, left, right, umbrella, cinnamon, shoulders, door, elbows, pod, sorry, once. Result: fewer injured than the number in my head. Secondary effects: a splice delivered a wrong word to a horn on Seventh, resulting in panic in two pockets and the movement of three tables we did not intend to move. Corrective: sang a second map. People chose.

At the bottom in the place where the form asked for witnesses, Bibi wrote Edda Marten and Kettu of Redmane and Helion Moth, then, without thinking about it and then thinking about it and not correcting, they wrote Orun. Under the line marked Additional Notes, they wrote Hum a room. Do not command. Twice.

There was a knock. Edda did not pretend to be a wall. She opened the door with her fingers fanned in disgust at whoever had decided to interrupt. A boy stood there with a hat in his hands like a prayer and a packet wrapped in oilcloth. He smelled like wet rope and sardines and the kind of tobacco you don’t admit to smoking. When Edda took the packet he flinched as if she might chew his fingers. “For the Voice,” he said, and looked at his feet, and ran.

Inside the packet lay a piece of paper that had been folded and unfolded so many times it had the softness of cloth. On it, in that same patient hand that had written down three stolen notes, there was a sketch of the siphon drawn with the kind of care that could have been love if it had been for a person. An arrow showed where the laundry clip lived. Another arrow showed where, if you cut here, you silenced the bleed. At the bottom, in a hand that had tried to be tidy and failed because the person who had written it lived too near rats and motors, were two lines: is this joke. not this time.

Bibi sat back in their chair and felt, absurdly, like crying because someone who had made their job harder had just offered them a piece of the map. Edda read over their shoulder, the way of a person who could not pretend to respect privacy without being unkind to the living. “Your rat man likes you,” she said.

“He likes the city,” Bibi said. “He likes the idea that he can break it and fix it. He likes to be inside the machine and think he is outside.”

“Don’t we all,” Edda said, and kissed Bibi’s temple as if to remind them that there are pieces of the world that do not come through horns.

At dusk Kettu came with a new shirt that was in fact an old shirt that had been turned, and with dirt on her shins that made beauty marks of impartial grime. “Thornback sent a bowl of congee to the Larynx with a note that said taste,” she said. “They are going to be a problem. They will sell you a ladder and then be angry when you use it to go somewhere they wished to keep in shadow.”

“Everything is a problem,” Bibi said, and then, because sometimes good news must be watched closely, “Did Orun see the siphon’s cut.”

“He sees everything,” Kettu said. “He pretends he does not in order to sleep. He went to look at the dorsal fields and came back with a face that says we are going to have to pretend to be bigger than we are for three days while a storm pretends to be smaller.”

“Three days,” Bibi said. “That is a lot of buckets.”

“It is,” Kettu said, and then, very softly and as if asking permission of the room first, “I am going to put a mark on you.”

Bibi lifted a brow without lifting their mouth. “Where,” they said, but the question was a way to slow the yes down until it took the shape of a decision.

“Here,” Kettu said, and pressed two fingers to the side of Bibi’s neck where the borrowed note rested when it was not needed and made of the pressure a circle. “So that if you are found in the wrong alley with men who do not love Voice but do love a new thing to throw stones at, the old women who come out in the mornings to empty pots will not let them kill you because you are marked with a circle that looks like a borrowed thing they respect. It will wash away. Do not wash it away.”

Bibi bowed slightly into the touch, the way you bow to a stack of paper that you know will bruise your eyes and still you love it. “What do I give you for this,” they said.

“You will not die in an alley,” Kettu said. “That will be coin enough.”

Night should have brought rest. It brought instead a whip of light along the west and the sound of men with long memories pushing barrels farther back from the powder store. It brought a tapping at the opera house window that turned out to be only a branch and a bird making claims. It brought Edda asleep on the divan with one hand on a ledger as if to keep the figures from running away. It brought Helion humming in the corridor like a lullaby he had not intended to be heard. It brought Bibi sitting on the floor with their back against a drawer marked HONEY AND DEATH because someone had once believed in bad luck and good filing.

On the desk, the crossed-out word Endling glared in the half-dark like an accusation. Below it, the square honest words Stay and Please and Here waited with the patience that people rarely grant other people. Bibi drew a circle around Here and then drew another around Please and then a larger one as if the circles themselves could perform the shape Kettu wanted. They wrote, in small letters under the circles, hum a room. They wrote, in smaller letters under that, do not bind. And they sat with it until the storm over the dorsal fields told the city, with a hand the size of a continent, that it had things to say.

In the morning the world took a breath that tasted like metal. The cranes in the harbor moved as one animal obeying an instinct it had not known it still held. The river pushed its shoulder against the market and then, as if it had remembered something kind, took it back. The Larynx yawned and seemed smaller because the last night had made everything larger. Bibi put on a coat that had been made for somebody who loved blue and not for someone who would stand in rooms that were already too cold. Edda pinned a small silver pin shaped like a comma to the coat so that Bibi would remember that a sentence can stop without ending.

Two new memos lay on the blotter. The first, from someone who would be a rival if Bibi allowed them that honor, said: interim does not mean sovereignty. Please refrain from singing during labor disputes. The men at Dock Twelve claim they were moved like pieces in a game. The second, unsigned and written on paper that had been swept of fish scales and then dried in a hurry, said: when you said here I could hear my wife in the kitchen. It was very annoying. She is dead. Also, this morning at first light a man with a bowl for a hat lay on his back under the west gate with his hands folded. He was not dead, but he was trying to be rude to the light. He said: Tell the hinge that debts hum. Then he went away.

Bibi crumpled neither. They put both under the blotter because the world is like that; it gives you a warning and a benediction in the same breath and expects you to file them together under MISC.

At noon, Kettu came to collect Bibi by nothing more than stepping into the doorway and existing. “We go to Redmane,” she said. “Bring the breath. Bring the word for hands. Bring the sound for door. Orun would like to show you something that is not a ladder and cannot be bought with fish sauce.”

They went, and the city for a moment felt like it was tilting toward the place where duty meets myth and makes a bad soup taste like something you have always eaten. The train bridge was slick. The succulents glistened as if they were waiting to be chosen for someone’s buttonhole. The birds in the low trees sang in keys that had survived bigger storms.

Orun was in the clearing with three elders and a young one whose ears were still too pink. He held a length of rope with a knot at one end and a knot at the other. “People who have never sailed call rope rope,” he said, which was as near to a joke as he was willing to risk before noon. “People who have sailed name every rope in a way that makes it not just rope. People who have fought know that a rope is often the difference between living and a story being told about you by people who never met you. Today you learn a rope song.”

“I thought you said not to make law with songs,” Bibi said, because pressure makes some people flippant.

“This is not law,” Orun said. “This is rope. When the crowd pushes, you sing the rope song. Not because it tells anyone what to do, but because it makes their hands remember that their hands have done this before. It will draw the right kind of people toward the ends.”

The old woman with the beadwork that crossed itself like vines took up the rope and handed an end to Bibi. The rope had seen water. It had seen blood. It had seen someone use it to measure a room. It had been coiled wrong and forgiven. “There is a note that makes hands move when voices are too tired to give orders,” the old woman said. “It is not the Old Call. It is the Old Pull. It sounds like this,” and the hum she gave the clearing was a thing you tasted in your gums.

Bibi took it. It was heavy. Their arms remembered something their grandmother had taught them about hanging laundry and catching a skirt in the wind. They sang the rope song badly, then better, then with enough ordinary courage that in a pinch the city would forgive their tone and follow their intention. The young Redmane with the pink ears watched Bibi’s mouth with reverence that made Bibi want to be on their best behavior for the rest of a life that was suddenly longer.

“When the water runs like a horse,” Orun said, making the rope flick and smooth with his wrists, “someone has to call the step. Someone will always step wrong. You will not save them all. The note will save some. Sleep will save some. War will take some. You cannot hold it all in your mouth. If you try, you will drown with it in your throat and you will be a story someone sells."

“Thornback sent a bowl of congee,” Kettu said, which in her dialect was a way of saying I have been watching the tide come in and I do not like what I have learned from its way of speaking. “They have a bowl in everything. They sent a man with a hat that is a bowl. They sent a bowl to the Larynx. It is funny until it is not.”

“Thornback is a city that makes knives that look like spoons,” Orun said. “Redmane carries spears that look like sticks. The Ministry writes memos that look like fans. Everyone lies about their weapons until someone stands up and sings and then there is no lying left. Today we teach the rope. Tomorrow we will teach you to hear the bell that rings where the road has washed away and the boy you think is about to die does not die because he is made of rope.”

They drilled. Bibi lost the skin on the first knuckle of their right hand and was proud. They learned where to put their weight when the line pulled on the heel instead of the shoulders. They listened to the old woman’s hum and found out how to hide it under their tongue and not boast about it. When they went back across the bridge the city felt heavier and kinder because it was holding more.

On the way, Edda met them at the bottom of the opera steps with a handful of newspapers that had reproduced the word Interim as if it were a stamp you could buy and put on things. “I have never seen so much life wasted on ink,” she said, and then softened it with a grin. “The cranes moved last night because a man on the radio told them to leave. That is the rumor. The rumor also says you told one woman to drown her mother. That one was printed on a fish wrapper this morning and is already wet and therefore already much truer than it was. Helion says he knows who owns the laundry clip. He says the clip can be stolen and collect H. We should buy H.”

“We will buy H when I have paid the market back for the time I told them where to put their elbows,” Bibi said. “We will not buy H from a man who would sell us his house and his wife in the same sentence. We will borrow from the apes and pay the apes with songs that don't try to be law. We will patch the wires with hands we trust and teeth if we must. How is the powder store.”

“Dry and attended,” Edda said before Bibi could. “It will not be the place that punishes you for liking words. Eat something. Your voice sounds like wet wood.”

Bibi ate something. It was something that had wanted to be bread and had ended up being an argument. They ate it like it had saved their life.

Helion came that evening with a box that had once held hat spangles and now held wires and two small bells labeled north and other north. He set it down and looked like a man who had walked into a wall and found that it was made of paper and therefore could be walked through if you were very polite. “The glitter-collar person has a cousin with a tower,” he said. “We are not going to cut their laundry clip because then they will make noise with mouths and pens and money. We are going to put a heavier weight on our line. We are going to sing past them. We are going to make our map brighter than their theft.”

“Will the map blind someone,” Bibi asked, because you must ask, like checking your pocket for holes before you put in your only coin.

“Probably,” Helion said. “We will stop if it does. We will learn. We will break our own wires. It is very exciting. It is very stupid. It is all we have. Kettu says we are only permitted to be noble if we can carry the rope song and still not break our backs. Orun says nothing because he only says the necessary things.”

“Orun says many necessary things,” Bibi said, and looked at the place where Kettu had pressed a circle into their neck. In the mirror it looked like nothing and felt like a law. “We will be tired,” they added, because naming a thing sometimes makes it sit down.

The storm that Orun did not like took a step toward the city. The next morning brought the smell of lightning and the sound of people counting water with their teeth. The radio man in the north wrote down a new note and then wiped it off his page because it did not fit in the place where a rumor goes. The man from Thornback sent a fish to Bibi’s desk with a prophecy written on paper inside its mouth and Edda did not allow Bibi to read it because some things only exist when you let the words in. The committee met without Bibi and decided to rewrite Form Twelve-A to include a line called effect on morale and timekeeping. Helion tuned the Larynx with a kinder hand than usual. Kettu taught the boy with the lopsided braids a way to say please that did not sound like a command.

When afternoon began to be other than itself, when the light went from pear to tin, when the river coughed and made people look toward the places they always forget until they cannot, the rope song in Bibi’s hands and the borrowed note under their tongue felt less like objects and more like drafts of something the city had always been writing. They took a breath. They did not look for the Old Call. They looked for the word that would not embarrass a person holding a bucket. They looked for a law that was not law. They looked for a way to keep the hinge oiled without holding the door shut with their whole body.

When the first barrel floated free, they were ready to shout with a song. When the second barrel floated free, they understood that shouting is not the only way to speak. When the third barrel did not float free because a hand had grasped it from water and held it with a habit older than knives, Bibi threw the rope into the song and pulled. They pulled with Kettu’s hand on their wrist and Helion’s hand on a knob and Edda’s hand on the corner of the desk that kept Bibi from falling forward into whatever the city had decided to be. They pulled, and for a breath, the world was a note and a door and a hinge that did not squeal.

In the near quarter, a child with a reed wreath on her head stepped into a doorway and whispered General names to herself, the way some children like to whisper the names of planets for comfort. In the far quarter, a man with patience and rats turned off his radio because it is sedition to be unable to sleep. In the middle, the Larynx gave back a word that was not law and not pop and not anything with edges that cut. It was something else. It was a way to shape air so that the thing you needed to do felt like a thing your grandmother had taught your hands.

Night came like a curtain someone had been sewing badly for years. The power hiccupped. The opera shivered. The marigolds died without anyone noticing because they had been too bright to see at the end. Bibi fell asleep with a pencil in their hand and a circle on their neck and the taste of salt in their mouth. In the distance a horn muttered a wrong syllable and then corrected itself because someone had moved the laundry clip. In the green beyond the bridge, Orun turned his head toward a sound that was almost thunder and decided it was men talking about a different kind of storm. In the market, someone wrote on a wall in chalk: HERE WE ARE, and someone else, unable to stop themselves, wrote under it, PLEASE, and drew a cat with a crown as if to make the request silly enough to be safe.

In the morning the man from Thornback did not come. He had already bought what he wanted with the only coin that works more than once: a hint. The city woke to more water and more work and the knowledge that for one more day, the end had not ended. The Larynx sat like a quiet animal. The rope lay where it had been thrown, damp and honest. Bibi sat at the desk, the blotter stain looking like a new continent after the flood, and lifted their pen. They wrote, not because it would save anyone, but because it would make the hinge slide a little easier when the next door needed opening.The morning shoved its arm through the window and tipped the night out, and the city woke into a sky the color of tin rubbed thin in places and black in others where the dorsal fields massed their temper. The storm had the smell of pennies sucked too hard. From the opera eaves, the first fat drops fell and made the dust remember it had once been river. Bibi stood with a towel over their shoulder as if a towel could be a plan and listened to the distant cranes complain in their sleep. A line on the blotter had darkened during the night and made a bay on the continent that the stain insisted upon being. The circle Kettu had pressed into the side of Bibi’s neck had faded to a whisper of thumbprint and ache, but when Bibi pressed their own fingers there, the borrowed note hummed as if to say, if you do not call me for work, I will sulk. Edda, hair braided back and stuck with three pins that had each known three owners, made breakfast like a verdict and put it into Bibi’s hand and then took it back when Bibi forgot to chew and held it again and said, “Eat. The sky doesn’t care what you put inside you, but I do.”

In the Ministry, the committee had left a little beast of paper on Bibi’s chair that said CHARTER FOR VOICE CONDUCT in letters pleased with themselves. Someone had taken care to make the language gentler than knives without reducing its teeth, and someone else had scrawled a margin of obscenities that had been neatly erased until only the pressure remained. The charter suggested that the Voice consult for all utterances exceeding two minutes, avoid particular syllables that gave offense to a subdistrict whose banners Bibi had never seen, and defer to the Ministry of Labor in cases of flood, epidemic, and riot. Bibi read three paragraphs and then looked out the high window at the wedge of sky that showed a different argument. Edda leaned against the lintel and rolled a brass ring across her knuckles as if it were a coin being practiced into vanishing. The resin smell in the rings was strong this morning, sharp and smoky, and Bibi could not pretend they hadn’t smelled it before. There were crafts in the city that claimed respect by never being named. “They would like to keep you from becoming yourself,” Edda said matter-of-factly. “They are not wrong to be afraid of people becoming themselves. It is tedious to clean up afterward.”

“It would be a relief to be told no,” Bibi said, and flipped the charter to look at the back where someone had drawn a tiny cat wearing a judge’s wig. “It would be a relief to say there was nothing I could have done.”

Edda, who knew more than one way to be kind without letting you go soft, touched the back of Bibi’s neck where Kettu’s circle had been. “You could always have done something else. That’s the unhappiness at the center of your job. It is also the only joy. I do not recommend joy without unhappiness. I have tried it. It turns sour.”

Redmane sent for Bibi without sending for Bibi. Kettu appeared in the doorway without knocking and did not pretend that her presence was not itself an instruction. “There is a ritual for sleep,” she said, and Bibi’s breath snagged, please not the Old, please do not make me look away again. “It is older than our rules,” Kettu added. “It is not the Old Call. It is for the old ones who wish to become a river and for the babies who have not decided how to hold their hands. If you are going to be the throat they do not hate, you must know the sound of our winter. Come.”

The clearing was different in the rain. It had the sound of patience being shaken and refusing to spill. Orun sat on one of the stones carved to look untouched, his hands on his knees, the beadwork at his throat dull with wet and more beautiful for it. An old one lay on a woven mat, each hair smoothed as if it had been persuaded to sleep before its owner. Around the circle, the younger ones did not pretend to be unafraid. They had faces the shape of still water and eyes that counted. The hum that came was a blanket that covered the clearing and tucked in the corners under the stones. It was not pretty. It was the truth about the way a chest moves when it has finished one duty and waits for the next. Bibi stood with their hands politely at their sides and let it go through the part of the body that ached when the day had been full of paper.

“Do not copy us,” the old woman with the vine beadwork said without looking at Bibi. “Sing your own sleep when you cannot. Make it thin and human and full of rust at the edges. It will work for your people, because it is theirs. Our sleep is ours.”

“I will not,” Bibi said, and meant it, because there are doors even the hinge will not hold. Orun watched Bibi the way you watch a stranger who has begun to listen to a song you loved before there were cities. When the hum fell into silence, the rain did a quiet applause on the leaves. Kettu took Bibi’s wrist and held it long enough that Bibi could feel Kettu’s pulse choose to match their own. “You are learning to carry without keeping,” Kettu said. “That is difficult. It is the only way you will live.”

Thornback did not knock. Thornback never knocked. A ball of rice wrapped in a lotus leaf arrived on Helion’s stool with a note that said taste in a hand that wanted you to think it couldn’t write. Helion sniffed the rice and then ate it and then took Bibi by the sleeve and pulled them into the corridor because Helion had lived long enough with his own hunger to know when not to pretend you were not being bribed. “They are testing how far their boat can drift into our kitchen,” he said. “They expect you to say no the second time so that you can say yes the third. We will be no on three, yes on seven, and on ten they will lose count.”

“I do not want to keep a ledger like that,” Bibi said, even as their mouth agreed with the rice that life persisted and might be delicious.

“Then keep the rope,” Helion said, and held up a coil of wire like rope for a joke too dense to laugh at. “The north quarter boy has written another letter. He has drawn me a siphon I did not know how to imagine. He has confessed to a talent in the guise of apology. He wishes to be forgiven for being useful. That kind of person is dangerous and dear. We should go look at his wall.”

The north quarter had a geometry of regret and ingenuity. The buildings had been built to clasp, then had been taught by the river to unclasp, and now clasped again in ways that had never been on paper. Kettu came because she did not let Bibi go down to the mechanic’s alleys without a body that could make sticks into law. Edda came because she said she needed to pick up resin that had cooled in a lady’s kitchen into small loaves for rings and lamps and lies. The boy, who was not a boy if you counted his scars, lived up three stairs that each had an extra half step which made the body remember itself. His radio was less a device and more an altar to attention, each screw a prayer. He had put a fruit crate against the wall and written on it with a sternness that wanted to be gentle: knock with two fingers, not three, do not touch the wire that sings, and if you take the laundry clip put it back. When Helion knocked with exactly two fingers, the boy looked up with his whole face and said, “This is a bad idea,” in a voice that could have been relief.

“I know,” Bibi said, and did not ask him his name, because names are what you give people when you wish to own them. He would give it when it mattered.

He showed them the splice with a cat’s caution. It was as elegant as it was shameful, a little machine made of stolen house parts and hope. It stole breath with a kindness that would have been cruelty if it had been pointed at a person. “I got scared,” he said flatly, not because he wanted their pity but because it was part of the instruction manual. “It did a sound I knew how to carry and then it did a sound I did not. I do not like to be the person who makes the wrong word. If you let me keep the clip, I will move the mouth of it to a place where the line for my street is and not yours.”

“The city is ours,” Kettu said lightly, which sounded like an argument and a lullaby.

“The map is not,” he countered. “Maps are made by hands. Voices are mouths. I am just a rat with a coil. I will build you a place for your words to not trip.”

Helion made the sound he made when someone used a blunt tool with such skill that Helion’s little precise heart had the grace to feel humility. “You could make a career of this,” he said, and the boy flinched as if a hand had been raised. Helion softened. “Or you could keep your rats and your radio and your fingers. Do you want money, or do you want a promise.”

“I want to not be arrested for the thing I’ll do the next time you say a word and forget about the people behind it,” he said to Bibi, and he held their eyes for a count of two before he looked away, which was the exact politeness level of someone who intends to remain intact.

“You will not be arrested for how you breathe,” Bibi said, and meant it in the way you mean a prayer you do not believe in yet. “We are going to move the clip. We are going to give you a weight so heavy your little mouth cannot take our words unless we say take. You will take when the market tells you to take, not when your ghosts say run.”

He stared at Bibi as if he were looking at a drawing in negative and trying to see the positive. Then he nodded once and put the clip in Helion’s hand and then took it back and then put it in Bibi’s because Helion wanted things too much and Bibi wanted them the right amount. “I will show you where to put your wire,” he said, and led them onto the roof that had slats like ribs and air that smelled like frying bananas and rain.

The storm took an hour to take its first breath and then wasted none. The sky came down lower and added its own weight to the city’s, and the cranes woke unhappily and began to move their necks with the reluctant grace of animals who would prefer a drier climate. The Persimmon Gate had been cleared yesterday, but the river loves a joke and threw a tree at it. The market made a sound that was not panic and was also not not panic, a wordless vowel that makes mothers push children’s heads down and men look for rope. Bibi felt the borrowed note in the mouth like a coin and tasted the debt of all the words they had ever said that were not the right ones. Kettu ran without seeming to, and Helion held the clip as if it were an egg someone had given him to carry from one room to another without instruction.

In the Larynx hall, the glitter-collar person had brought five men who looked like irons in good shirts, and a letter stamped with the Ministry’s new seal that had an extra flourish for world that made Bibi want to put their finger on it and smudge. “Emergency protocol,” they said, and put the letter on a table as if it were a plate on which they would feed you. “We will be taking over the horn for the next two hours. The rhetoric has been prepared to minimize loss of property. We will be inserting the words curfew, dispersal, and compliance. Please feel free to sit in the audience and watch how the professionals do it.”

Kettu made a noise like a little laugh that got lost on the way to her mouth and became something else. Helion held the clip up and then down and then up again and decided not to break anyone’s teeth with it. Bibi looked at Orun, who stood by the door like something that understands both hinges and battering rams. Orun did not move. He did not have to.

“This is not your horn,” Bibi said to glitter-collar, whose mouth had been careful all morning and now was about to stop being. “It is not mine either. It is the city’s. If you put the words dispersal and compliance into it today, you will have fewer broken windows and more drowned people. They will run in the wrong direction because your rhyme will be better than your map. Stand aside. Or speak into a bucket and ask the tide to sign your letter.”

Glitter-collar smiled without showing teeth and then smiled with teeth, and both were expensive. “Interim does not mean queen,” they said softly in Bibi’s ear with the kind of intimacy that you give enemies in crowded rooms. “You are here because the lottery liked a joke. You will live here for as long as we like the joke. Then we will put the microphone into a person with a nephew and a house on a hill. Do not imagine you can outlast a structure. You can be charming and useful and temporary. That is your dignity.”

“Then do not test the city’s patience for charm and utility,” Bibi said, and stepped onto the dais with a heart that had decided to beat as if it were counting a child’s steps. “Stand with me if you wish to be counted later among the people who were not cruel in the important hour.”

Orun did not nod. He did not have to. He stepped slightly and made the room tilt toward the dais, and when a room tilts toward the dais you find yourself in the audience or you leave. Glitter-collar’s irons decided to be audience for now. Kettu slid herself between their edges and Bibi’s and looked like a woman who has a very good reason to enjoy her afternoon.

The map was not the same as yesterday because water is not a woman who wears the same dress twice. The Persimmon Gate had grown three exasperations and a new alcove where a fruit seller had put her extraneous gods and a picture of a gray cat with a crown. The rope song had a different catch in it because the knot had been tied by a left-handed boy whose mother had taught him to cut bread with a spoon. Helion had found the weight for the line and had put it in the place where the rat-boy said to put it, and when the Larynx opened its mouth the words did not bleed out of the sides like soup from a cracked bowl.

“Breathe,” Bibi sang, softer than yesterday and heavier, because the air had to be persuaded to carry. “Hands on the rope, not on each other. Left step to the mat with the picture of the fish. Right step when the bell goes. Do not be brave with glass. Be brave with balance. The boy with the purple ribbon is now a child with a green one. There are three cats. There is a banana peel. There is cinnamon. Lift when you smell cinnamon. If you smell flowers, it is a lie. The flowers are soap. Lift when you smell cinnamon.”

The first motion went wrong because someone always hears a different bell. A stack of bowls became a river, and two men shouted because shouting is default. Then the rope took, because the old woman’s hum was in it even in absentia. The body of the market did not stop being itself. It became a different version of itself that the river recognized as interesting and not worth punishing today. Koru Redmane moved in the edges where punishment likes to hide. Kettu’s hand on Bibi’s wrist was a cool wire that did not let the hand forget it was attached to a person.

In the middle of this, because the city believed in making definitions unhelpful, the Ten Toes opened its shutters like eyelids and let out a cousin with a drum and a bar owner with injured history. Taln had a mouth like a hook and a niece who wanted him to be better. He had chosen the wrong day to bring his grievance into the shape of rain. The cousin set the drum down where it could not help but be in the way. Bibi felt the word no rise in the Larynx like a bubble. They closed their teeth on it, because no commands nothing. They sang instead the smallest most ordinary circle they had. They hummed a room and made the room be a place where the cousin could not find the rhythm he wanted because the floor had long since decided to give him a different beat. The cousin laughed despite himself, that old reflex coming back like a cough, and changed his hand without knowing he had been told to.

Glitter-collar stood with their hands very still as if in prayer, which meant they were doing a calculation. One of the irons looked at the horn as if wondering what sound it would make if it were hit with his head. Helion murmured numbers not because numbers helped him now but because they helped him always. Orun watched the door, because there is always a door where you think there is none.

The siphon bit once, tried leave again, and got cloth for its teeth. The boy in the north quarter sat on his crate and held his breath because his wire had weight on it it had never carried. He let it take him into a room in his head where his father smoked and did not look at him and let the radio speak for both of them. He pressed the paper with the drawing of the siphon under his palm so it would remember which way was off.

By the time the first edge of the storm’s skin had moved off the dorsal fields and decided that the city had been a satisfying thing to argue with today, the market was the kind of mess you expect when life has been chewing. There were fish in the wrong places and people laughing because if they did not laugh they would not put their feet down correctly. There were too many oranges. There was a woman sitting on a turned barrel with a baby who had decided not to cry. Bibi stepped away from the horn the way you step off a boat that has been very kind to you but which would like you to leave. Kettu let her hand stay around Bibi’s wrist one beat longer than necessary. Helion turned two knobs as if tightening a lid and then took his hands away and made himself look at them, which was an old superstition he hadn’t known he still owned.

Glitter-collar put their letter back into its envelope without bending it. “You do this well,” they said, with a sting in the sugar. “That is both a compliment and a policy problem. We will need to define what well means. We cannot have a voice with preferences.”

“Everyone with a mouth has preferences,” Edda said in a tone that suggested she had no compunction about naming them. “The question is whether they are visible or not, and who profits by that invisibility.”

“I do not like that the city believes in you,” glitter-collar said, because politeness had been exhausted. “I like that the city believes in the chair.”

“The chair will not pull a rope,” Bibi said, and for once did not soften it with a please.

They went home through streets that had been washed and were now drying themselves like children after a game. Edda walked with her palm turned outward, catching the last five raindrops as if they were proof that weather exists. Kettu peeled the bandage off her hand and replaced it with a ribbon a child had handed her, because conversion of gifts is the most civilized work. Helion carried the clip in his pocket and pretended to forget it, because he wished his pockets to be a place where bad choices go to die.

That night brought quiet in bars and a fight in an alley where fight lives anyway. It brought the old woman in Redmane humming a memory to a baby who would one day hold a spear and for now only held a thumb. It brought the radio boy sleeping with his head on a coil of wire and his knees drawn up like someone who has not yet learned to lie long. It brought a courier with a hat on his head and a paper in his pocket that said in a neat minister’s hand there will be a vote to codify your mouth, and in another hand that had been written over it said let them try.

The next morning the flowers on Bibi’s desk had been replaced by a plant that knows how to be its own water, thick leaves arranged to catch what the room would give. On top of the plant sat a bowl that had once been a hat, this time filled with marbles the color of river glass. There was no note. Edda touched one marble with the tip of her ring and hissed because it had been heated and cooled in a way that made it good for keeping a bowl honest and terrible for keeping a person’s temper. “Debts hum,” she said, and lifted the bowl and set it on a shelf. “You may not answer this today. Today there is a parade of men with papers who wish to explain ethics to you in unpleasant fonts.”

The parade arrived on schedule and consisted of two ministers with shirts that did not understand rain, one woman with the word audit stitched into her pocket as if it were a belief, and a man whose smile had a crack in it like a plate that has been prettily glued. They wanted to know why the Voice had used cinnamon as a cue because cinnamon is a luxury and you should not teach the poor to listen for rich smells. They wanted to know why there had been mention of cats because cats divide the city into two irreconcilable nations. They wanted to know why the word please had been employed when a crisis requires clarity.

“Because please makes a door where a demand makes a wall,” Bibi said, tired of making metaphors nicer than themselves. “Because cinnamon exists at more stalls than the one you buy your bread at. Because people are not appendages of your planning documents. Because the rope song does not care about your opinions of cats, and because if you want to live in the city you have you must learn the sound of it asking you for help.”

The man with the glued smile wanted to be offended and did not have time. Orun’s second, a broad-shouldered male with beads for daughters braided at his wrists, put his head in and said, “The dorsal fields have decided to be our concern. We will need your map. We will need your manner. Also, there is a child who will say your name because to not say it would hurt her teeth.”

Bibi went. They went because it is very hard to remain in a room when a flood is telling you where you belong. The dorsal fields had not been built for human eyes; they were for sky and for the tall grass that remembers animals with complicated stomachs. The storm had broken itself on them and then reassembled. The air was like chewing foil. Redmane had a line pulled tight from a fallen palm to a stuck wagon and the rope song lay over it like a scarf. Bibi went to the Larynx because the map would need to be bigger than shoulders, but before they touched the microphone, they stood in the wet and did what the old woman had told them to do. They hummed for their own sleep. They made it thin and rusted and unashamed. Kettu, who did not enjoy being moved by human noises, blinked once in a way that would have been an admission if she were someone else. “You are learning you are not the city,” she said. “It is making you better at your work.”

The dorsal fields, pettish and generous, gave up three boys who had thought to surf a door, one goat who had wanted to be a saint and settled for a story, and six barrels of nails that would become a market’s skeleton. They took one thing and no one asked for it back because grief is not a thing you bargain with on a public day. When the work had the shape of happiness you are allowed, Orun came and stood close enough to count as weather. “You did not sing law,” he said, not as praise and not as accusation. “You sang time. Time is useful when a thing needs to be moved.”

“I will never sing law,” Bibi said, which was a vow pronounced in a place where vows sound like they might be embarrassing later.

“You will,” Orun said. “Because you live here. It will be small, and the law will be not like laws, and you will hate yourself for a day and then forget. That is how cities speak without having to take anyone to dinner. When you do it, put a circle in the sentence so that a person can walk out and not be punished by the grammar.”

Bibi wanted to argue because argument is how you hold your place in a conversation with people who have earned theirs the hard way. They did not argue because Orun’s face had the expression it has when he is thinking about sleep and putting his spear away and the heads of small children. From the north quarter came the faintest of whistles, not the rat-boy’s radio this time but a woman’s pan calling nonsense to give courage. Helion tightened the weight on the line and told the horn to behave as if it belonged to a decent family. Edda took a match and lit a wick under a kettle as if boiling water to make tea could keep a city upright. Kettu stood with her feet making a small argument with the ground and watched to see if it conceded. The city lifted as one, and then, because it is not a horse, it shuffled, and then, by some arithmetic no one had written down, it moved into a different balance.

That night, under a sky that had decided to stop being personal, Bibi sat with a new memo that asked them to justify the cost of singing as compared to the cost of buying twice as many men with shirts. They wrote, Patient labor saved. Rope unfrayed. Children bruised less. Time banked like kindling. They added, Cinnamon is affordable, and underlined it until the pen found a ridge in the paper and made a tiny hole. Edda blew out the lamp with the same efficiency she brought to loving someone a lot and put her hand over Bibi’s hand and said, “Go to bed. The hinge can be oiled in the morning.”

Bibi lay awake because you cannot sleep after being the thing people held onto and then let go without checking your arms for dents. Outside, someone walked by singing not well. Across the green, Orun named the stars by their utility and then stopped and named them by their sound because it was a generous night. In the north, a radio lay quiet. In the west, under the gate, someone set down a bowl and waited for it to tell the truth and then picked it up and took it home. On the blotter, in the square where Endling had once dared and been crossed out, Bibi wrote the phrase rope song under their breath and then added a circle around here as if the punctuation could catch anything that fell.

In the morning the market smelled like rain and opinion. The committee had decided nothing because it is difficult to codify something that sings, and the poets had already begun to sully the facts with better words. Koru Redmane came for the plant and put it on their own table because it had learned how to keep water without being dramatic about it. The Ten Toes hung its shutters open and sold pickled pears for people to put in their mouths when they had been too proud at the river and needed a sour to bring them back. The glitter-collar person sent a card with a picture of a bridge on it, and on the back they had written we will be drafting to protect you, which was their way of saying we will be drafting to protect us. Edda put the card in the stove without looking and then took it out and smoothed it before the corner could burn because you never know what paper might be useful later.

Kettu brought Bibi a shirt with sleeves that could be rolled easily and a pocket that hid its own. “You do not have to be splendid,” she said. “You have to be easy to move in and hard to knock down.” Helion brought a box of marbles that were not marbles but something he had made with a boy who had decided to tell the truth about the way his wires whined. Orun brought nothing and stood in a doorway. Bibi lifted their chin in the way their grandmother had taught them when you needed more sky and said, because saying is sometimes a map you hand yourself, “Stay. Please. Here. And when we must, pull.” Then they went to do the thing you go to a desk for: they made a list of doors, and under each they wrote the name of a hinge.The day after the storm’s first argument, the city held its breath the way a singer does before a note that is either going to be miraculous or broken. The dorsal fields sulked at the horizon like a great animal deciding if it had been insulted enough, and the street horns had their mouths wiped of silt with rags that knew better songs than their owners. In the Ministry, light came in low and sideways, making columns out of dust motes and turning the stain on Bibi’s blotter into a bay that could support commerce if anyone would agree on tariffs. The new plant on the corner of the desk sat with the humility of a thing confident it would outlast policy. Edda put down a cup of something hot and restorative and refused to name it, because naming a drink sets expectations that the body often cannot meet, and then drew a straight line across a piece of paper just to prove to the morning that some things could be arranged.

Helion presented himself with the air of a man pretending he had slept. His hair stuck up in a way that confessed he had not, and his scarf was the red one that meant he intended to get away with something if the day allowed. He put a small box on the desk with the care you give a lark’s egg. Inside lay two little bells labeled north and other north, wire threaded through their throats in a way that suggested opinion. “We will give the line a spine,” he said, before Bibi could ask. “The rat’s patience boy has taught me where to anchor the weight without teaching me what it felt like to learn it, which is generous and mean. If we ring north and other north, our words will know where to go when they are tired.”

“Do words go places when they are tired,” Edda said, and rotated one of her rings so that the resin caught light the color of a liar’s promise. “I thought they mostly fell asleep in people’s mouths and became dream spit.”

“They go to roofs,” Helion said gravely. “And to the spots under tables where children keep crusts. They go to the exact place a man puts his thumb when he is trying to hold back a door and save the hinges. They carry. They do not like to be carried. We must treat them like cats.” He looked at Bibi. “The committee will visit with paper teeth. Glitter wishes to draft you into being safe for their friends. There is talk of a test from outside. The World Larynx is sniffing at our window like a dog.”

Bibi had known this would come, because when you put your mouth near a horn the size of a horse’s ribcage, the world notices if it is bored. A messenger in a shirt with three collars had already come at dawn, panting ceremonial words: alignment, interoperability, civility. A test broadcast, he had said, overbrimming with borrowed importance. The World Larynx would open its throat and hum a neutral tone to see if the city’s net could catch it without biting. It would then carry a handful of sentences approved by the charter of cities to ensure the pipes were not full of frogs. The messenger had said all this without stopping for breath and then had needed to sit down and be given a biscuit.

“We will fail on purpose,” Edda had said when the messenger left, and had looked at Bibi’s face and amended, “We will fail where it matters and pass where we must, because we do not have the luxury of being purely principled when our roof leaks. We will thread a needle through their mouth and it will not like the way we sew.” She said it again now, less for Helion than to hear the sound it made in morning air. “If their test tells us how large their mouth is, we will learn to sing syllables small enough to pass without being chewed.”

Kettu arrived as if the sentence had summoned her. The mark she had pressed into the side of Bibi’s neck two days ago was gone to the eye but remained in the finger, and she touched it once as if to remind them both of its promise. Her braid was damp and there was a line of green along one calf where grass had tried to become a tattoo. “Redmane has a sleep,” she said, without decoration. “You should learn to watch it without being the kind of human who thinks observation is ownership. Also there is a boy making boats out of doors. Orun does not approve of the doors or the boy. He sent me to fetch you, which is code for, I have decided to do the sensible thing and will now require someone else to do the part where we make it feel useful.”

They went to the clearing. Rain had changed it without moving it, a new smell in the moss, a new sound where drops fell from one leaf to another and made a count only old ones noticed. The old one on the mat had slept for two days and now would sleep for longer. The hum that covered her was thin at the edge and rusty in the center and perfect for the purpose. Bibi stood with the respectful distance of a stranger in a kitchen watching someone shape bread. When the hum ended, the rain applauded again, and the old woman with the vine beadwork spat into the dirt and made a spiral with her toe that was a map of a house you only visit in weather. “Do you understand,” she said without interest in the answer, and then answered for them. “You do not. That is not a criticism. You will not understand and still you will help, if you can keep from the habit of naming everything you cannot own.”

“I am well practiced in not owning,” Bibi said, which was either a joke or a confession, and earned them a glance from Orun that weighed it and put it away in a box labeled later. The General had the rope in his hands again. He had added a knot where a knot had not been necessary but would now be useful, the way a woman adds a pocket to a dress she intends to keep. He watched Bibi the way you watch the sky when you are not afraid it will fall but are wary of what it might throw.

Thornback slipped into the day as if a seam had been left and they owned the needle. The emissary with the lacquered hat—now a bowl in memory and sometimes in fact—stood at the line of trees with a thing in his hands that might have been a toy and might have been a weapon and was neither, because it was a boat with a throat. He spun it once like a coin to make the light show its edges. “A courtesy,” he said. “A boat of echoes. Put it on the river where the city talks and it will carry the taste of a word farther than your pipe intends. We made it with our own breath and with the leather of an animal that does not mind being remembered this way. We bring it because the World Larynx will come to rub your fur the wrong way and say, purr. You will need to know how to growl without using teeth.”

Kettu took the boat and then did not take it, which is a Redmane trick. Her eyes said thank you and her hands said perhaps, and the emissary accepted both because he was clever enough not to press. Bibi looked at the little shape and thought of the siphons and clips and weights and boys who drew diagrams on soft paper and did not ask for coin. “A gift we cannot return,” Bibi said, and the man inclined his head at the accuracy. “We do not have a place to put it yet.”

“You will,” he said. “You already have. Thornback does not bring a bowl to a famine and expect it to stay empty. Thornback will ask a thing one day. We will call it a story and you will call it a debt and the cats will call it irrelevant. Perhaps we will all be right.” He put the boat on the ground and walked away as if this were a thing that happened often between cities, boats left among leaves for no one and everyone.

Bibi did not pick it up. Orun did not pretend not to have preferences; he said, “We are going to the dorsal stores,” and the way he said stores made the hair on the back of Bibi’s neck recall Kettu’s joke about spicing. “Kettly would like to pretend she did not predict the day, and I would like to pretend she was joking. The powder sleeps. The storm is a poor bedfellow. We will learn what the difference between law and rope really is.”

It is difficult to explain to a person who has not stood near the barrels how much alive powder seems when the air is lit with the ghost of lightning. The dorsal stores were set back under a bank where grass made a pretend roof and thorn trees planted by good sense kept children’s curiosity at the respectful edge. The barrels sat like patient saints. Men and women with faces for routine stood with buckets and sand and disbelief at the sky. A line had already been tied to a fallen log and to a stubborn wagon, and a second line had been tied to nothing at all because panic is not logical. You could taste saltpeter if you knew the taste of your own work.

Bibi felt the Larynx hall call their bones and did not go. The rope song had hands here. The map had feet. Kettu put the rope into Bibi’s fist and did not let go immediately, making sure the weight knew it had two bodies to work with. Helion had run ahead with a small bell in his pocket and a coil of wire in his head, and now stood near the thorn trees whispering to metal. The rat’s patience boy had followed a different line to a place where his little altar could hear a horn it usually ignored. Edda had somehow gotten there faster than anyone who did not run and stood with her hands on her hips and her eyebrows telling a story about an argument she intended to have later with someone who thought paperwork could carry water.

The powder was moved because a city that has learned to listen can carry delicate things the way it carries children who have fallen asleep too soon. There were burns, because law is not a salve and rope splits calluses when pulled wrong. A boy who had tied his knot as if tying a scarf on a lover took a lash of hemp across his ear and smiled anyway because he would be admired this evening. An old man who had sworn off gradients of danger twenty years ago found himself on a slope. A barrel slipped and someone who had been a stranger put a hand out and became an uncle for an hour. The sky walked away sullenly with its pockets still full of static, and the barrels did not explode because they had been flattered into moving by the right note at the right time, and because Kettu had the hands of a woman who knew which fingers to save for later.

When it was done, Orun said nothing. He put his hand on one barrel as if to remind it that it had a name, and it did not speak that name to the rain. Bibi washed a line of grit off their forearm with water that had probably already been assigned to three other tasks and felt that line sting like a lesson. They wanted, very much, to go to sleep. Instead, the committee arrived with their paper teeth and their chairs.

The committee had decided to hold the vote on codifying the mouth in a room that had never been used for voting, because it had nice windows. They had brought a chandelier from somewhere else to hang above people’s heads as a reminder that gravity is patient. The glitter-collar person had been born to sit in such rooms. They made their face into a piece of furniture and then into light. The ministers arranged themselves like punctuation marks that insisted on rules. A woman who wore audit as if it were a perfume took notes into a book that could have been used as a weapon if the day required. Bibi stood in the not-quite-center because you cannot stand in the center of a thing you do not own.

“It is a framework,” glitter-collar said, with a sweetness that cured nothing. “We only ask for predictability. The city is full of risk. The Voice then arrives and adds another. We propose a list of permissible words and forbidden constructions. We propose a time limit. We propose a testing phase. We propose a remonstrance if the Voice violates best practice. This is not a gag. It is a cloth napkin.”

“You want to know what I will say before I say it,” Bibi said, and surprised themselves by not making the habit of metaphors do more work than necessary. “You want to be able to sell a copy of it to a man who wants to be reassured. You will get your reassurance and we will get more drowned people. I cannot hand you my mouth and ask you to carve it into safe shape. It is not safe. It is part of a city that is not safe. It is good work. It is ugly work. It is a work you will not be allowed to do because you chose to be the kind of person who says please let us draft code.”

“Interim,” said the man with the glued smile, as if it were the answer to every argument. “You are not permanent. You must not build traditions we cannot undo. If we allow your voice to establish custom we cannot change, we will be ruled by accident. Let us put a bit of law into the horn now. Nothing radical. Nothing that cannot be untied. A freeze on the use of sticks at the docks during hours of flood. A promise that no one with a badge will strike someone with a bucket. A line about how rope songs supersede orders. A curfew on knives in the night market, but said in a pretty way.”

The room’s air thickened in the manner of rooms where everyone is about to pretend they did not already know the way the vote would go. Orun stood by the door and made the wood feel important. Kettu stood at Bibi’s shoulder and allowed one person who had been elected to catch her eye and then look away, ashamed. Helion had left his bells somewhere and now had only his knee that clicked when he moved it and his mouth that refused to be silent in polite rooms. Edda stood with her back to a column and twisted her rings until someone would accuse her of nervousness, which she would deny with a story about a cat.

“You want a law that is not a law,” Bibi said, and this time made the metaphor their own. “You want me to put a circle into the Larynx so that people feel their hands being their hands. You want to be able to tell your constituents that you made the city behave. You want to pretend you didn’t ask me to make it. Fine. I will make a sentence that opens and closes like a hand. It will be binding in a way that people can decline without being criminal. It will ask, and the asking will have weight. It will be yours in that it will save your face, and mine in that it will not be a cudgel.”

It was a poor trick and also the only one. Bibi walked to the Larynx with their heart trying on four different time signatures for how to beat in public. The horn’s mouth looked bigger in a room that had decided to be a cathedral for the next twenty minutes. Bibi held the borrowed note under their tongue like a lozenge and thought of the old woman’s hum that made rope willing. They put Orun’s advice into their pocket like a coin. They made a circle in the sentence for people who needed to step out of it without being broken by grammar.

“During red-water hours,” Bibi sang, quiet enough that the horn leaned in, “hands are for rope and children. During red-water hours, mouths are for maps. If you must defend your life, say it first. If you must hit, put down your bucket only when your neighbor has their grip. If you must run, run toward the umbrella with green on it. If you cannot hear, watch the shoulders. If you cannot see, touch the rope and hum so the rope remembers you belong. When the bell says the water has stopped being a person, go back to your work and your grudges. Keep your knives for fish and your sticks for beans. Keep your anger for the rooms where anger earns us money. If you do not agree, say no, and we will make room where you stand.”

It was a law, and it was not. The horn took it and made it large without letting it be larger than itself. Out in the market, one man who had decided to open a crate with a hammer he had also been using on people put the hammer down and used a spoon because he had been given permission to keep his grudge and still be a neighbor. In the docks, a woman who intended to shout the instruction for dispersal changed it at the last second to the word rope because the mouth cannot help itself when it hears a better rhyme. A boy who had not wanted to be told anything by anyone heard the sentence about umbrellas and laughed because of the green and did what he would have done even without the law. In the alley where sticks liked to be used after dark, a person who had been waiting for a permission slip to be kind found one. In the north quarter, the rat’s patience boy wrote down the words ran toward umbrella and then crossed them out and wrote toward green because he had discovered that making the sentence smaller made it stronger.

The committee voted to say they had supported it. The glitter-collar person said the word framework again and it meant something else. Orun left without making his leaving theatrical and without correcting the room’s posture, which was kind. Kettu squeezed Bibi’s wrist once and walked away to find a fight that had not realized it had been postponed. Helion leaned his forehead against a piece of brass that had not asked for this intimacy and said, quietly and almost to himself, “We will call this one a circle law and no one will like the name. I will make a list. It will be a short list. I will burn it when we have written three items on it.”

The city absorbed the law in the way it absorbs a difficult lunch: with discomfort, with relief when it does not kill you, with a story later about how it was not as good as last time. At Ten Toes, the cousin with the drum set the stick down gently and did not play, and Taln stood with his mouth trying to grow into a better shape and failing and in the failing building a bridge. Edda sold twelve wedges of lime to men who had never in their lives liked lime and two to women who had always liked lime but did not know why now was the right time. Kettu put a mark on Bibi’s other wrist with her thumb, a circle like a bruise’s memory, and did not explain it to the boy who asked. Helion wrote the word circle on a paper and then drew three squares around it because he did not intend to let anyone believe in only one shape.

Evening was allowed to begin. The dorsal fields rested their chin on their hands and watched the city like a parent not wanting to interrupt a game. The plant on Bibi’s desk trapped four drops and made them into a plan for tomorrow. The marbles in the bowl Thornback had left each held a small light that might have been sun or might have been a lie. The rat-boy came to the opera steps and sat with his knees making points of argument and his face making the opposite. He did not speak at first. When he did, he said, “I took the clip off. I put it in a place where only the cat can find it. The cat likes me. It embarrasses me to say this. Your sentence was a circle. It allowed me to step out and not feel like a traitor. I have never liked feeling like a traitor. I am trying to arrange my life so that I am loyal to something other than my own ideas.”

“Try being loyal to the market,” Edda said, from the other side of the step, where she had not been seen and thus had had the pleasure of being witness. “It will cheat on you with everybody and still it will come home. You will never be bored.”

They would have allowed the night to stay quiet, but the world, which is a contrary thing, put its fist on the table. The test from outside arrived without waiting for anyone to put on their careful shirt. The World Larynx cleared its throat and the horns on six streets said ah in a way that set the teeth of people who had never left the city on edge. The first tone came through like a gallery of polite men, round and harmless and well-shaped by committees. It nested itself in the net and made no noise that smelled of frogs. The second tone was a sentence about good practice, and the horns repeated it with only a small warble where the city objected. The third was a song.

It was not the Old Call and it was not one of the new ropes. It was a note long and narrow like a blade and thin as a story told by a person who does not like to be interrupted. It carried nothing in it that could bind, and yet it made the hairs on the backs of the elders’ hands lift as if they had been named. It came from elsewhere—north and not-north, east and not-east—and because the city had not yet learned to distrust its own curiosity, it listened. In the Volta district, three women turned their heads as if someone had said their houses’ names in honest tones. In Redmane’s clearing, the old woman with the beadwork stopped plaiting a thread and made a noise that made young ones look to Orun to see if the noise was a history or a warning. In the Larynx hall, the glitter-collar person smiled as if to say, see, this is how a voice behaves when it has been taught, and Helion whispered a word that was not fit for a public room and then apologized to the horn like a man who has left his mistress in a storm.

Bibi stood very still. The note carried the shape of a circle, but it had no door. It was a law from another city dressed as a song, and it did not bother to make room for decline. It said, without saying it, disperse. It said, with clever vowels, do not gather. It said, with a courtesy that had knives hidden under it, our safety demands your silence. It said, with a kind coldness, be good.

Kettu’s hand found Bibi’s wrist because habit and also because she had not enjoyed the way the hair had just gone up on the back of her own neck. “Do not answer until you have decided whether answering is an invitation,” she said, which is the sort of thing people like Kettu say because they understand doors. Orun moved, which is to say the floor reconsidered its responsibilities. The rat-boy’s knee clicked because he had a trick in common with Helion and a different one of his own. Edda hissed between her teeth and tasted the note as if it were a soup gone off.

The World Larynx sang the blade note again. It sounded longer. It sounded thinner. It sounded like a rope with no hands on it. It sounded like a spoon.

“Not ours,” Bibi said, softly and to the room and to the plant and to Kettu’s ribbon and to the marbles in the thornback bowl. “We don’t make people smaller here when it rains.” Then, with the feeling you get when you open a door that might be a wall pretending, they put the borrowed note under their tongue and sang into the Larynx a thing that was not defiance and not consent. They sang a map that had no center. They sang a circle with a door left swinging. They sang the hum of a room with buckets in it and hands. They put the word here where a note like a blade could not cut it. They put the word please into the seam and did not apologize.

The horn wavered between two mouths that did not intend to share. The room felt the wires choose a weight. On the outer blocks, people who had been about to go inside because a distant city had told them to behave decided to stay outside a little longer and help pick up fruit, because the voice that belonged to their place had asked them to finish the work. In Redmane’s clearing, the old woman hummed under the blade until the blade remembered it was only air. In a bad alley, three men who intended to test how much of abroad would fit in their fists found that their wrists felt silly when they tried to hit in time to a foreign tone. The World Larynx sang a third time, and then, perhaps because the person at that end had been told to stop behaving like a human being, it stopped.

Helion let his forehead stay against the brass, which was either love or heatstroke. Glitter-collar arranged their face into triumph and amended it into an enormous smallness. Orun closed his hand into a shape that was not a fist and was not nothing. Kettu made a sound like a laugh that had forgotten its own punchline and remembered a proverb.

Bibi looked at the horn and thought about what a hinge does when the door on one side is heavier than the wall on the other. You do what you can so it does not tear itself off. You grease. You put a shoulder. You do not stand in front of it and demand virtue. They had wanted a day when songs could be only songs. The city had not given it. They had been asked to feed a law to a machine and had done so with a circle that made room for refusals. They had been offered a blade from outside and had put a door in front of it.

“Tomorrow,” Edda said mildly, as if to give the day a way to stop, “we will need more limes. Someone has written me a note about cinnamon theft, and Kettu has been invited to a tea at which women will pretend not to discuss men. Helion will make a list and then set it on fire. The rat boy will put his ear to a wire and listen for cats. You will be called to three rooms and you will have to decide which two to leave insulted. And a man with a bowl will send a fable that is only a bill but written in poetry.”

“Also,” Kettu said, looking out the high window with a face that had counted rain and decided to like it anyway, “an elder will die who did not tell you their name and you will be sad for a thing you never learned. We will teach you to say goodbye to people you knew only as rope songs. It will be annoying.”

“Yes,” Bibi said, and was grateful for the ordinary future, even if it had knives in it under napkins. They put their hand on the blotter and traced the bay. They drew a small circle around the word here and then a bigger one and then, because sometimes redundancy is a way of being brave, another. Then the plant caught a drop and refused to let it go and the city took a breath and decided to practice not drowning for one more day.Morning returned with the stubbornness of a ledger line that will not add up unless you change the numbers you love. The sky was pewter again but friendlier, the dorsal fields’ temper banked like a dragon that had been given a wicker basket and told it was a bed. The plant on Bibi’s desk fattened itself with two small drops and offered no advice. Edda set down a plate with bread that had decided, overnight, to be better, and said, “There’s a woman downstairs wearing a hat like a cake. She is here to invite me to tea and you to regret.” She flicked a ring with a thumbnail and resin flashed the color of truth seen slantwise. “Also there is a man in the lobby pretending not to be from Audit and a child from Redmane with a pebble in her shoe and a message that says hurry without saying hurry.”

Bibi ate the bread because today had the shape of a day on which people would want to watch whether the Voice chewed, and swallowed when Edda looked pointedly at their throat. “Orun?” they said, and Edda shook her head once.

“Kettu. And a rope. And a thing like a ceremony that is not. We are back to the problem of names. Also, Helion’s scarf is blue again, which means he intends to drown in a teacup and call it theater.”

Kettu did not wait for the bread to end. She put a palm on the blotter as if to test whether the stain was warm. The way she stood in a doorway had the quality of a verdict. Her hair had been braided with a ribbon a child had put into her hand and a twig had gotten itself into the braid as a joke and stayed. “An elder has died who did not think you a fool,” she said, and the words had the weight they deserved. “You will come and you will not sing unless you cannot help yourself. You will learn to sit through the part where we talk to the ground as if it were a person and you will not think to translate. That is your practice in restraint.”

Bibi’s breath did the thing it did when a rope song came near their ribs. It made a tidy space there and put in it the word respect. “Yes,” Bibi said simply, and the yes was a shape around the edges of a hum. Edda kissed the corner of their jaw as if to add a comma to the agreement. “Tea after,” she added, and the promise soothed something in Bibi that grew chafed by ceremonies without sandwiches.

Redmane’s clearing held itself as if a wind had decided that gravity was a polite suggestion. The old one lay on a mat that had been woven by hands that knew how to count without needing numbers. Beads lay on her chest like small planets deciding whether to orbit a body that had changed its mind about being a sun. The hum was already there, begun by a cousin and taken up by everyone who had ever been taught to touch their own throat before touching metal. Orun sat at the edge and did not pretend not to be moved. He held a rope instead of a spear because grief, too, is a thing with two ends.

“This is not sleep,” the bead-worked elder who had lent Bibi a note said, because accuracy is a courtesy. “This is leaving in pieces and then deciding to be one thing elsewhere. We hum because we have learned that breath is stubborn and likes to be given a project. We hum because a room without sound is suspicious. You will be quiet because your noise is young. If your body insists, you will make your small human sleep under your breath and it will be forgiven.” She set the heel of her hand on Bibi’s sternum for a count of four and Bibi felt themselves become a container of sensible size.

They sat. The hum did what it does: it put a hand on the head of the child who wanted to ask when and said later, it put a hand on the shoulder of a young one who had decided to shape pride into argument and said after, it put a hand on the rope and said this too is a body. It did not ask permission of time because it did not need to. Somewhere in the middle of themselves, because Kettu had taught them to be honest even when it made you want to bite, Bibi let a thin human sleep-song out of their mouth, a thing with iron filings in it and a smell of old ledger paper. It had the dignity to be small. When it was over the rain did its quiet clapping and Bibi looked at the ground and did not mistake it for a ledger.

The elder was carried away on a pattern of faces and Bibi stood because everyone did and learned the way Redmane shakes out grief: two beats in the shoulders, one in the jaw, and the last one in the hands where it cannot break a tooth. Kettu leaned so close Bibi could smell the grass in her braid. “Now the part where you would like to turn grief into work,” she said without the rebuke most people hide in such sentences. “There is a boy making boats from doors. The river approves. Orun does not. That is a problem whose solution requires three jokes, a rope, and a woman who makes marbles from sand and debts.”

The boy’s boats were good bad ideas. He had ripped interior doors from their hinges in the tenements nearest the river, planed nothing, nailed little. He had an eye for balance that would have made an engineer flinch and then applaud. Children pressed their noses over the railing of the bridge as if they were watching a parade where all the floats intended to drown. “He sells them for two fish and a promise to give back the wood,” Kettu said dryly. “He believes in contracts enforced by guilt. He will be killed by someone’s uncle if we do not intervene with culture.”

Bibi took the child’s calculation in as if it were a map thrust into their already-full bag. “Why did you pull doors, boy,” they asked, and the boy looked as if his skin did not fit and his eyes had decided to be old early.

“The river asked,” he said, which is the sort of thing children say when they are telling the truth. “Also the men with shirts will not bring their coin to where the water is, but they will buy a boat to watch. I like to hold money and then let it go. It makes me feel like the river is inside me. Also the doors were not locked. Also I put a note on every frame.”

“What note,” Kettu asked, because she is her own audit.

“Bring it back when the water is tired of you,” he said primly, and Bibi was undone for a second by the elegance of the instruction. “Also, if your mother asks, tell her I told you no. I did. My mouth said no. My hands said yes. I am learning to argue with myself. It is like a house with two kitchens.”

Bibi thought of Orun’s face, the way a storm and a sleep live there in wary friendship. “You cannot take people’s doors,” Bibi said, and the boy’s mouth made that little rebellion shape all boys’ mouths have been making since buildings learned to stand in lines. “I can can,” he said, defiant and delighted, and Kettu made a noise that might have been a laugh wrapped in moral fiber.

“We will make a different boat,” Bibi said. “We will pay you for your clever and your hands with something that is not other people’s hinges. Thornback left us a thing that floats echo. You will help us learn it. You will learn to put your nails into your own wood first. If you touch a door that is not yours, you will find Kettu instead of the river and you will not enjoy that lesson. In exchange, you will go to the woman at the end of Narrow Lane who smelts sand into truth and you will ask her to teach you how to make glass behave.”

The boy’s eyes did that widening thing that is half fear, half appetite. “Why glass,” he said, and Bibi felt Edda’s grin in their own mouth.

“Because it proves itself without stealing anyone’s sleep,” Bibi said. “Because it breaks cleanly and you can see when it is cracked. Because it will teach you to love heat and patience in equal parts. Because it knows how to be river without being theft.”

They left him with a rope as a bridle and a note for the glassmaker and went to tea because one must sometimes go where people talk politely and cut with forks. The lady who wore a hat like a cake had a parlor that pretended to be country and smelled like everything city women hide behind words like rustic. The tea was the kind that insists upon your tongue being a schoolchild, and the sweets were the kind that leave your fingers slick enough to make you forgive gossip its sins.

“Dear Edda,” the hostess said, making dear sound like a hook in a drawer of knives. “And our Voice. How brave you are to come among us. We have been doing our part. We have formed a Committee for Civility. We have drafted a letter encouraging the Voice to refrain from frightening words. We have had cards printed that say, ‘If you are cross, please go home.’ We have told the gentlemen they must not bring their moods to market. We have assigned a song to the scourers who clean the drains so they will not sing workmen’s ditties. We are an army.”

Edda placed a sugar cube on her tongue and bit it like a person who will later commit a crime. “How admirable,” she said. “We have also been doing our part. We have taught children to hum when they are about to push. We have put rope into the hands that like sticks too much. We have told the Voice to keep using the word please because it preserves dignity in rooms you do not visit. We have asked the drain-singers to keep their ditties because they carry the pattern of water and because I would cut my own ear off before I allowed anyone to assign me a tune. We are also an army. Ours has better songs.”

“Of course,” the woman said, biting civility until blood came and then pretending it was jam. “We all have parts to play. We will need you to sign our letter. The World Larynx has promised us a little airtime for a culture spot. We thought perhaps the Voice could speak about etiquette in floods. Not like law. Like advice.”

Bibi put the teacup down like a person placing a delicate instrument into a case. “Your letter reads to men like a woman with a spoon,” they said, without enough apology. “Men do not put down sticks when a spoon tells them. They put down sticks when their neighbor looks at their hand and says the word rope. If you want to help, bake. Bring wedges of sour to the places where sugar has been keeping people from making decisions. Stitch pockets into dresses and aprons where hard things can be carried. Do you know how to braid,” they asked, and the woman blinked at the thought of her fingers catching something other than lace. “Kettly says a braid turns three weak things into one useful thing. Make braids. Put them on tables. Put them into hair. Tie them to your letters and make the letters harder to swallow.”

Edda coughed out a laugh into her napkin and then committed the social crime of liking someone. “Invite them to the market,” she told the hostess gently. “Not to look. To carry. Give them baskets. If they refuse, name them kindly as cowards. Call it fashion. You will get better pictures than your parties and better husbands than the ones you have.”

Helion, who had been pressed into a chair and made to accept a cake as if it were an insult, said “north” under his breath twice and made the little bell in his pocket whisper. “The test from outside will come again,” he said when the spoons had clinked enough that one more clink would be a rebellion. “They are going to try to teach us how to say good morning and then use that door to bring their chair to our room. We will need to thread our own thread through their needle. I would like to buy the rat-boy a sandwich and call him friend. I would like you not to tell me his name until he tells me.”

“He will not tell you,” Kettu said, enjoying the cake like a soldier who has learned the value of fields other than dorsal. “He will tell Bibi. He will tell the cat. He will tell the boat we have not decided to use. He will not tell the man who carries bells like a priest.” She licked sugar off a thumb and looked approvingly at her own lack of manners.

Bibi did not sign the civility letter, which would become a story we told later about a room where lace tried to lie down with rope and they respected each other enough not to pretend. They signed instead a note for the glassmaker and a request for more limes and a form that said the Larynx would keep a record of borrowed speech and who had lent it. The form felt like a conscience and folded like compromise.

Afternoon brought currents from elsewhere. The World Larynx sent a courier with a ribbon on his sleeve the color of truce. He read a letter that called the city dear in five different ways and offered a shelf of programming: lullabies collected from thirty-three municipalities, a sermon on civic quiet from a man who had never been asked to lift a barrel, a series of poems about progress written in glass towers and printed on silk. “We will broadcast together,” the letter said warmly. “We do not wish to drown you. We wish to harmonize. Here are the tones that constitute harmony. Please adjust.”

Bibi rolled the letter up like a poster and did not throw it away, which is a kind of diplomacy. “We will send them a basket,” Edda said. “Half limes, because they do not know what to do with sour, half marbles, because they do not trust transparency, one rope, because they will hang it in the foyer and call it artisanal, and one fish, because they always forget fish. We will not send them a spoon.”

Kettu brought the echo boat into the Larynx hall as if it were a child she did not intend to adopt. It was wooden and sly, the leather throat cut in such a way that it looked dignified even when ridiculous. “If we put it into the water,” she said, “it will carry the shape of a note further than our pipe, and people in alleys we forget will hear please carried on their own air. If we put it into the water, Thornback will arrive at our kitchen at the precise hour when our latest pot is empty and ask us to admire their timing.”

“Do it,” Bibi said, and surprised themselves. “Do it now while we still remember that gratitude is not the same as debt. We will put the boat in with names tied to its little ribs so we can tell ourselves it belongs to us while it goes elsewhere. We will let people far out hear the rope song and think it is theirs. We will have to survive the Thornback man saying told you so. He says it very well. I would not let him rob me less for having said it.”

The boat went with the satisfied wobble of a thing that has been allowed to do what it was built for. It took a circle law on its little back and made the word here mean a little more. It sang the rope song softly so as not to wake other cities’ dust. It brought back three messages in bottles and a piece of driftwood shaped like an ear. One bottle had a note that said stop with a heart under it, one had a recipe for a soup that would keep the old warm, one had a child’s drawing of a cat in a crown on a boat. Helion wanted to frame the cat. Edda did.

Toward evening, because the world enjoys a rhythm even when it breaks its instruments, the World Larynx sang again. This time it did not bring a blade. It brought a honeyed thing, a lullaby about closing shutters and honoring bedtime, about the benefits of silence when men who have never worked with their hands discuss the destiny of hands. It was persuasive in the way a lullaby is when you have had no sleep and the chair knows it.

Orun was at the door again, because he is when it matters. He did not speak. He held a rope. His eyes said: your city is about to be tucked into bed by a stranger. Kettu’s fingers on Bibi’s wrist said: do not be charmed into losing your evening. Helion’s knee clicked a protest at the misuse of lullabies.

Bibi tuned the Larynx not with the knobs but with the word order in their head. “Sleep on your own terms,” they sang quietly, and the horn made quiet large. “We sing work to sleep when work needs it. We do not sleep when a stranger says our name and asks for our hands. If your roof leaks, patch. If your neighbor calls, go. If you are tired, sit with your back against a good wall and close your eyes and keep one hand on the rope. Do not confuse silence with peace. Do not confuse noise with harm. If your child says they are afraid, hum the room and let the fear decide to be reasonable. If you hear a lullaby that does not know your kitchen, save it for another day. We will not be tucked. We will lie down when we can. We will snore. We will wake.”

People did not all obey. The city is not a church full of well-trained believers and thank whatever gods have not resigned for that. Some closed shutters happily because they had been looking for an excuse. Some went out and emptied a ditch by moonlight, humming badly and then better. One woman braided three lengths of rough twine and hung the braid beside her door because she had heard Kettu’s instruction secondhand and trusted secondhand more than first. Three boys who had not liked being made to sit still at school found that their bodies agreed to sit still for a stranger’s song and were embarrassed enough to make a nuisance of themselves on purpose.

After the first set of windows had been decided by individual conscience, something small and unbranded arrived at the Larynx hall. It moved like an apology and stood like a man. It was Taln from Ten Toes, hat in his hand, his face a map of a country that has been misruled. He looked at Bibi as if asking permission to address a machine and then decided to speak to the person. “I have a thing that I should have said to my niece and am too proud, so I will say it to your horn and pretend the horn told me to,” he announced, with a bar owner’s courtesy. “I will stop letting my grief hire my hands. I will not let my cousin beat my customers because they drink where my brother did not. I will keep a bucket by my door and a rope. If anyone from Thornback asks me to store a bowl in my back room, I will say yes only if the bowl is empty and we put bread in it. Will the horn say it with me so my mouth learns.”

Bibi did not look at the committee in the corner because sometimes law is made in bars and the Larynx must learn to smell beer. “Yes,” they said simply, and let Taln speak into the horn and made his words big enough for the four streets around Ten Toes. A woman who had sworn never to step into his place again because of what had been shouted at her at dawn stood in her kitchen and cried because law had sounded like home for a second. The cousin listened with his drum under his hand and decided, with relief that hurt, to go find someone to apologize to. The world did not change. It shifted its weight in a way that would matter.

Night tried to be ordinary. It failed in credible ways. A spark where it should not have been put its mouth to lint near the dorsal stores and was pushed away with a hand that had rope callus on it. A boy in the north quarter who had not wanted to tell anyone his name fed a cat a bit of fried fish and whispered into the radio for a count of eleven and then shut it off because he had promised himself an integrity. A woman with a cake hat wrote a letter that was better than the one she had asked Bibi to sign, and then burned it because sometimes a thing is only good while you are writing it. Orun lay down with his hand on a spear that he did not intend to lift tomorrow. Kettu slept with both hands open.

Morning was interrupted brutally by Audit. The woman with audit for perfume came with two assistants and a book with a wooden cover. She put the book down on the blotter and the continent stain turned it into an archipelago. “We would like the ledgers of your mouth,” she said. “We would like the expenses. We would like the receipts for rope. We would like to know who pays for limes. We would like the names of the old ones whose notes you have borrowed and shall continue to borrow so that if they die we can make a proper account of the things we owe their families.”

Edda made a sound that made the resin in her rings recoil. “You would like an itemized bill for courtesy,” she said, and the auditor actually had the decency to blink as if caught with her fingers on a stovetop. “We buy limes from a woman whose palms have more lines than your procedures and you may go down and ask her if she enjoys being categorized, but keep a hand near your face. She might throw a spoon. As for the rope, it belongs to Redmane, and they will look at your accounting with their humor cut out and give you a form called we do not fill this out and you will cry. As for the old ones, give me your wrist. I will put a circle on it and when you get home tonight and reach for your comb, your comb will refuse your hand.”

Bibi, because their job required a certain cruelty, did not let Edda finish her fifth barb. “Sit,” they said to Audit, who sat because chairs are monarchy. “We will try this. I will write you a ledger. It will not have numbers. It will have countings. We will call it Ledger of Breath. On this page we will put: rope pulled, buckets lifted, fights postponed, doors not stolen because a boy was taught to make glass. On this page we will put: time kept by bells and therefore not lost, names learned and therefore held, marbles bought and bowls refused. On this page we will put: circle laws made and why they did not harden. You may copy it. You may not demand the names I have not been given to use. If you try, I will hum in your office until your plants decide to become anarchists.”

Audit smiled, and it was horrifying to discover that she could. “That will do,” she said. “For now. I will take you at ledger. And if a minister asks me for numbers, I will say this is a city of hums. And if he asks me for a song, I will say he may go to the Larynx and ask it to repeat him.”

The day brought the kind of quiet that tricksters fear. The World Larynx did not sing. Thornback did not send a bowl. Glitter-collar did not arrive with ironed men. The market pretended to be ordinary and then threw oranges at a child who had been too proud, and the child laughed and apologized because his shirt smelled like rope. Helion fell asleep in a chair with his head tilted back like the mouth of a horn. The rat-boy brought a coil of wire and the two bells to the desk and said, unasked and without looking at anyone’s face, “My name is Lio in my mother’s mouth and something else in my father’s. You may call me Lio when you are in a hurry.”

“Lio,” Bibi said, letting the name sit where it could not be put to work badly. “Thank you. Do you need work to hunger less.”

“I need work to not eat myself,” he said, and wiped his nose with a hand that would never be clean. “I have put the weight in your line where I would put a promise in my life. It will hold if you do not shout. If you shout, make the shouting humor. It carries better than command.”

Toward evening, because drama dislikes moderation, men with old uniforms came out of corners with their despair polished. They had intended to march. They had intended to call it pride and grief and ask the city to let them lay down their medals like knives and be absolved. A minister with a glued smile planned to stand on a stool at the head and ride their aching like a ferry. Orun had smelled this in the dorsal fields and did not approve. He stood in the mouth of a street and made it smaller with his shoulders. Kettu stationed herself at the end where men who leave marches in search of bottles always peel off. Helion set the bells on a windowsill and told them to fight gravity with him. Edda put a bowl of limes on the Ten Toes bar and told Taln that if he let men break each other on his floor tonight she would tell a story about him so good it would make him cry.

Bibi did not go to the Larynx. They went into the street with their mouth held between their teeth and their wrists bare where the circles still felt like being watched. “Hum the room,” Kettu had said earlier, and now the room was a street full of men who had decided to be shouted for. Bibi started low and human and rusted because it was their job not to compete with the brass in their heads. They sang a map of not-war. They sang the rope song under it and a line of cinnamon and the word here in all the places a body must remember if it is not to embarrass itself. They sang that if a man must put his medal down, he can put it on a barrel and the barrel will not be ashamed to carry it for an hour. They sang that if a man must be told he is still useful, there is a bucket. They sang that pride can be put on a rope like laundry and air will do something to it that makes it bearable.

The march did not dissolve because that is for fables. It mended itself at the fringe. It developed a sense of shame among the hands that had been itching. The minister with the glued smile stepped down from the stool because no one was looking at him and people become smaller when there is no looking. Orun stood a little less like a door. Kettu stayed exactly like a door and two men who had thought to impress her by fighting reconsidered and decided to be impressive another day with dowels and a cart whose wheel was wrong. Lio, at his radio, did not try to take a slice of the hum because he had promised not to without being asked. He put his ear to the wire and listened for cats and heard one. It purred, which meant nothing and everything.

After, when the street had returned to being a place where dust likes to show off and not a stage, Kettu leaned on a wall and let sweat dry in a manner that would later be described by someone as unseemly and by everyone else as holy. “You did not make law,” she said, half testing, half proud.

“I made a sound and a suggestion,” Bibi said, tiredness in their bones like good bread. “If that is law, we are all criminals.”

“Some will say so,” Orun said, appearing with a rope over one shoulder and an expression that suggested he had outlived the desire to be easy. “Let them come to the dorsal fields and say it where the grass can smell. If they still believe their mouths then, I will let them sing to my old sleep and see if it wakes.”

Night found the opera quieter. The plant on the desk decided one leaf was too much and fell gracefully. Edda put it into a glass and called it arrangement. Helion burned a list that had three items on it and then made another because sometimes theater must be disciplined. Lio wrote a schematic for a thing that did not yet exist and drew a cat wearing a crown in the corner and blushed when Bibi noticed. Kettu stood in the doorway and pressed her thumb into the inside of Bibi’s wrist without looking as if this were normal. Bibi put their head on the blotter, not quite touching the stain, and breathed like a person whose work has not yet ended and whose breath has learned not to ask for permission to continue.

In the middle of the night the World Larynx sang once more and then stopped, as if it had been told a story enough times and was ready to learn a new one. The note it left behind in the wires was one that Redmane recognized as not hostile and not friendly but workable. Orun, not sleeping because men who have carried too much do not, watched the sky and called stars by their stupid names and their proper ones. He felt a little tired happiness at the city’s refusal to be a thing it had not chosen. He did not say it out loud because he was learning to leave some good thoughts unspoken so they would not spoil.

Bibi dreamed a dream with cabinets in it. They were all slightly ajar and someone had filled them with rope coiled to look like words. The drawers had labels: cinnamon, cats, courtesy, audit. In the morning the labels had changed and the drawers were stubborn. The plant had made two roots the length of a first knuckle in water that had not been given to it the day before. Edda wrote a note in a hand that knew how to make threats look like recipes: Boy with boats has not stolen any doors for a day. Thornback sent no bowls. Minister sent a card with the word remonstrance, which I threw with accuracy at a rat and then retrieved because we will probably need it. Kettu at nine. Orun when the sky decides itself. Helion has an idea and it will itch. Eat.

Bibi did, and then went to the rope. The day had that particular brightness that means breakage later. The air smelled like a plan that does not like being spoken. The Larynx sat without complaint. The city breathed a breath that was not law and was also not not law, and the hinge remembered which door it was holding and which it was leaving ajar.
