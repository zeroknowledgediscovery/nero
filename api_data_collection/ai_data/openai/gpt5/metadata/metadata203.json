     "novel_text": "When the haar slips down from the Forth and takes hold of the wynds and closes, the city makes itself small. Noise goes away. Colours go to sleep. Victorine does not. She lifts a shutter with her thumb as a child might lift a curtain of ivy, and stoops to peer in at a mirror, at the slick red curve of a young man\u2019s mouth as he practices a smile he means for someone else.\n\nHe does not see her. He sees only himself and the glass of his phone. His name will not be said here because it does not last; names do not last, though they hold so much. What lasts is the soft mica gleam of his lower lip, the crooked left edge where he bit it once. He swallows. He has no idea that she is already holding him in her light.\n\nThe camera is not delicate. It is weighty as a dictionary and more decisive. She cradles it in two palms so large the strap is a ribbon. It snaps. A bright box chirrups, and the image starts to slide from its mouth.\n\n\u201cPlease, hold still,\u201d Victorine whispers, almost polite. The man pauses, startled by nothing he can place. His reflection is rose-tinted by the bar\u2019s lamps. Her voice is soft, a warmer fog within the fog, the breath that runs along a spine, not cold exactly but aware.\n\nEverything she does is for love, because of love, fuelled by the kind that legends threaten you with and prayers secretly beg for. When she kneels, plants groan under her knee and the cobbles decide to remember the weight of giants. Love asks enormous things. It asks her to follow, and she follows.\n\nShe has learned streets by the taste of them. The brine taste of Leith. The green-copper taste at the foot of the Scott Monument. The soot-and-rain taste of Cowgate where laughter falls like bottles into a bin. She leans to catch the edges, the details. The hair above a lip like a handful of barley. A mouth like a hinge. A mouth like a wound a little healed. She does not see faces. Not really. She has trained herself to see only the boundary where voice becomes world: the lips.\n\nHer camera coughs another square. She tucks the prints in a pouch at her belt, an old belt, old leather softened by oil and her own enormous warmth. The prints are damp and their shadows are still swimming into shape. It matters this \u2014 that they arrive slowly, that they have time to learn themselves. She hums to them. A small tune. It sounds like one lamp left on in the kitchen after a party, a yellow place for talking when the music has gone. She hums and the fog listens.\n\n\u201cOi,\u201d says someone. It is the boy\u2019s friend at last, shaking his phone like a torch. \u201cYou coming or what?\u201d\n\nThe young man leaves the mirror with a last little check, that crooked edge quick, a rehearsal repeated. He goes and is gone, and Victorine takes a picture of the space where his mouth had been and tucks that away too. Nothing is lost. Nothing is about to be lost, she promises herself. The bag of mouths knocks against her thigh. She rises, her shoulder briefly shouldering the low cloud that makes her hair damp, and she goes.\n\nOn the other side of the city, in the yellow light of a restaurant that is always almost closing, Mr Cook slides two panna cottas onto a tray and balances a single espresso between them like a jewel in a setting. The espresso is for the woman at table four who has talked for forty minutes about a man who does not love her. The panna cottas are for the two quiet boys at table nine who keep looking at the door.\n\n\u201cBe careful with that,\u201d Lorna says, summoning the espresso with the twitch of a hand made perfect by seventeen years of this. \u201cShe\u2019s the sort who sues.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the sort who is already disappointed,\u201d Mr Cook says. He is not unkind about it; he has learned to name things and move along. He moves along rather well. He wears black with a grey apron over it and his shoes are not fashionable but they are clean and he has his mother\u2019s shoulders on his father\u2019s bones. People call him Mr Cook because it\u2019s printed there on the receipt when they split their bill and write Don't forget Mr Cook! in the tip line with a little heart. It amuses him. He has a first name like anyone else. He has not used it much lately.\n\nOutside, the fog pushes its soft face against the panes and leaves a sheen. Mr Cook looks up and the sheen shivers, as if someone very large has breathed. He does not yet do the thing he will do, which is step outside and be ridiculous and useful at once. He delivers desserts, retrieves a credit card from beneath a bread plate, laughs when laughed at, receives a story he didn\u2019t ask for, and when it is all done he locks the door himself because the owner has gone home and because tonight, as so many nights, the city is a little unattached and requires someone to say yes, there, the end, we are closed, we are safe.\n\n\u201cDid you hear,\u201d Lorna says, tying a scarf so bright it raises the room a degree, \u201cabout the thing down by Dean Village? About the odd footprints in the mud like\u2014 like something that had no business wearing shoes?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a hundred things with no business wearing shoes,\u201d Mr Cook says. He washes his hands again by habit. The tap squeals; his wrists are thin, the tendons trick strings. \u201cWas it you out there in the mud looking for news?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my cousin\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s pal and it was on his story,\u201d she says. \u201cIt had that little face you can add with the sick eyebrows, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can just about manage an email,\u201d Mr Cook says. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me for eyebrows.\u201d He dries his hands. He has a particular way of folding towels into the drawer, so they open all the same way, like books ready at the library. The order is not about fear. It is about harm reduction. That\u2019s what his therapist called it once, back when he could afford a therapist. He could afford one again now, he supposes, but then who would he talk to about it? He thinks of talking. He does not call anyone.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lorna says, and glances through the fog toward the street. \u201cYou going home?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a minute,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to wait for the dishwasher to finish so I know it is not going to flood and murder us all in our sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a poet, Mr Cook.\u201d\n\nHe is not a poet. He can\u2019t keep a line in his head to save it. He says goodnight and watches the door seal itself around Lorna as she peels herself away into the city and the city takes her back, as it always does. He listens to the dishwasher and the tick of the clock on the wall that is chronically slow because its battery is a traitor. At last he shuts the last lights and steps into the grey.\n\nHe walks home on a route that is not the shortest but is the one he likes because it carries him along the Water of Leith, where the world is narrower and there are foxes who are not troubled by men. His shoes make soft sounds. A bus sighs out on the big road, sounding like someone who has decided to try again anyway.\n\nIt happens quickly, in the kind of quiet that belongs to a church and a bus station at 2 a.m. The path dips and curves and he is in a little hollow made by trees and walls, and ahead of him is not a fox. The thing ahead is a shadow and then a corner of someone\u2019s coat and then \u2014 a face, but not the face, because what he sees is the mouth and what he sees past the mouth is the hand that lifts something heavy and square.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Mr Cook says, a thing to say when you see something odd but not yet a reason to panic. \u201cYou all right?\u201d\n\nIt is a boy, maybe twenty. He has the pale skin of a person who has spent too many nights helping bars fill their bins. He is focusing on staying upright. He\u2019s focused on his phone. He does not turn. The person with the heavy square does not turn, either, and Mr Cook sees then that the heavy square is a camera, old-looking and severe.\n\nHe hears it: the little animal machine sound. Dispatch. The boy\u2019s mouth is pink in the flash. His lips, to be precise, and they are very slightly chapped, the kind of chapping from kissing in the cold and not from a deficiency in chapstick. The flash is not a flash \u2014 it is more like the fog catching fire and then deciding not to.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Mr Cook says again, and now there is purpose in it. He takes a stride nearer. The person holding the camera raises a hand as if to say wait. The hand is not possible. It is very large. Not big like rugby. Large like door. Large like a kind of slow-falling weather.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s close enough,\u201d the person says. A woman\u2019s voice, low and apologetic and thick with something like rain. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m working.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d He stops on the word working because there is a comedy to it and the comedy is a place he can breathe. \u201cYou\u2019re working? At this hour? Is it for a magazine?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is for someone I love,\u201d and God help everyone, she means it.\n\nHe sees her as the fog moves just a little. She cannot be as tall as the trees. She cannot be alive, not at that size and angle, the Firth smell on her hair and the wet of a long walk under a low sky. She is stooping. She is trying to be shy. Her coat is stitched from a tent, or from something that once had a mast, and her face is as careful as a librarian's hand about to turn a fragile page.\n\nThe boy mutters, \u201cMate?\u201d to nobody exactly. He is free, and does not know it yet. He has been captured and released. The photograph slides out like a tongue. The boy\u2019s friend howls from the bridge that he is paying for the taxi without him. He goes up to the bridge in pieces \u2014 not literally; in that drunken way that life becomes composed of stairs and breath and stairs.\n\nVictorine holds the picture to make it warm. She looks up at Mr Cook and for a moment something like an understanding visits them with the fog: neither of them wants to frighten what is already always frightened. It is an odd moment to be introduced.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a giant,\u201d he says, because he is a simple man in a complicated room.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a waiter.\u201d\n\nThe answer is so exact it tips him forward. \u201cI don\u2019t usually bring the desserts down here,\u201d he says. The joke falls and makes a small sound somewhere near the water.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t hurt them,\u201d she says. She nods toward the bridge. The camera strap swings like a black river on her shoulder. \u201cI am making a book. I am making proof. I am\u2014\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know what she is. She stops.\n\n\u201cWhat is it,\u201d he asks, \u201cyou\u2019re proving?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I loved him,\u201d she says. \u201cThat I know where the voice comes from when it kisses. That I can make him out of the world even though the world keeps eating him.\u201d\n\nWords like that are a danger. They are too bare. They are a sore you have picked clean and now it gleams, slick and helpless. He is used to plates; he is not used to this. He hears, as if from a distance, his own voice shape a question that is not his own: \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know him,\u201d she says, and the disappointment in that is mild and absolute, a weather pattern that determines crops. \u201cHe is no one. He is everyone. Don\u2019t worry. It is not a murder, what I am doing. It is the opposite of murder.\u201d She produces the second photograph and holds them side by side, two boys\u2019 mouths already turning toward themselves, becoming, in the way of such pictures, both more real and more partial. \u201cThere,\u201d she says. \u201cLook how they try to say, even when they are doing nothing, one more thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d he says. He has no right to say it. He says it anyway, as someone might reach for a glass falling. \u201cThey\u2019re not for you. And if they were, you would not be able to keep them safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho keeps anything safe,\u201d she says, not unkindly. \u201cWhat do you keep safe? The panna cottas? The teaspoons?\u201d She looks out over the black water. \u201cI keep these. I keep them.\u201d\n\nHe should call someone. He should turn and run and find a phone box like a film and telephone the police. He should move, should make a simple ordinary sound that will break the enchantment and make her regular sized. But the fog does not allow for ordinary; the water is a dark semaphore; she is a shape written on the stone buildings by a hand that is used to writing in the margins.\n\n\u201cMy name is Mr Cook,\u201d he says, and this time it sounds like a line he might like to keep. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re frightening them whether you mean to or not. And anyway \u2014 anyway you can\u2019t go about at night taking folk\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLips,\u201d she says, helpful.\n\n\u201cPhotographs,\u201d he says, and pinches the bridge of his nose to keep his thoughts from slope. \u201cPhotographs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I will. I have to finish before the world changes and starts to sing a different song.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens if you don\u2019t,\u201d he asks. He cannot stop himself.\n\nShe considers this in the way someone might consider the speed of a train they are about to miss. \u201cHe will close his mouth,\u201d she says. \u201cHe will close it forever. And I will never hear it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d he says, useless, and just then a fox crosses their path with a piece of bread in its mouth and the world opens its hands again and the fog rolls with the contentment of a cat that has chosen a lap.\n\nThey stand like that for a breath. She is much too big, and he is much too brave and not enough. She tucks the two photographs away. She steps back once, twice. The trees list as if a wind had changed direction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you are frightened,\u201d she says. \u201cPlease tell them they are beautiful and that they do not know it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone tells them that,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is the particular curse of them. It is why they keep going out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is good then,\u201d she says, as if that settled anything. She nods, a serious tilt, and then she is gone, as in gone. Not slowly. It is a series of edits: her shoulder, her hand, the shadow made by her knee, the leaf that had been stuck to her coat, the idea of her. The fog unknots. He is alone. He does not call anyone. He goes home, and his bedsheets are cold.\n\nIn the morning the city acts as if it has always been an honest saxophone. Ten o\u2019clock light bends itself around corners; cats repair themselves. Mr Cook drinks a coffee that tastes like soil and rain and suspicion. He doesn\u2019t speak of it at the restaurant because he will be laughed at and because it is not that kind of story. He will tell it one day to someone he has not yet met; not now. Now is for orders and orders up.\n\nA group of students come in with scarves and hangover faces and say things like \u201cthe vibe in here\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m literally starving\u201d and laugh as if that were legal. Two young men sit near the window and arrange themselves in the light so their skin could be listened to by cameras. He finds he is watching their mouths. He takes orders and tries not to make a cathedral out of everything.\n\n\u201cMake an exception,\u201d Lorna says, pushing him with an elbow as she reaches for a glass. \u201cCome out tonight. We\u2019ll go up to the Meadows, there\u2019s a thing on. Food trucks. Music. People. You can\u2019t sit in your flat with your radio on like an old man choking on the shipping forecast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do that exact thing,\u201d Mr Cook says. \u201cI am a creature of habit, and my habit is loneliness.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiar,\u201d she says, and she is right; the habit is attention. He lives on watching. You can tell things, what people want, what they will eat, what they came here to be told about themselves. He is a doctor of menus and an amateur hydrologist of shame. He has watched so long that it is a kind of marriage.\n\nHe goes to the Meadows. He does. It is all too bright. The bands sound like they have just read a note about how to be joyous and are trying it out for the first time. People sit on damp grass anyway because they are young and invincible and because their trousers are not expensive. He buys a paper plate of noodles so hot the steam becomes political. He stands and he watches mouths.\n\nVictorine is not there. Of course she is not there. She does not like daylight. She does not like crowds except as a field in which mouths bloom and she can visit like a bee at night. But there is a rumour that she is always not far, a gravitational wrongness, and when someone laughs there is an extra beat after it where you might hear a camera settle itself against a palm like a bird on a wrist.\n\nMr Cook hears nothing. He sees nothing. He goes home later by a route he does not usually take and discovers, in a lane behind a chemist, a photograph pinned to a corkboard among flyers for rooms to let and a man with a van: a small square of lips. No face. No eyes. Just a mouth slightly open and the pink, faintly wet interior where someone else\u2019s name would sit before it came out. The photograph has a small pin through one corner. It is labelled in a hand that has to be big: Aidan, Fountainbridge, likes sugar.\n\nHe takes it. He does not know why he does this except that it feels like an act of theft in favour of the world. He has a drawer with coasters and spare keys and packets of soy sauce, all the items that are both useful and in the wrong place. He puts the photograph there. He does not sleep well. He dreams of kissing his own knuckles because they are familiar.\n\nThe days turn. Victorine goes about her work like a tide with a timetable. She knows the stairwells where boys pause to check their breath. She knows the bathrooms in pubs where boys rehearse expressions. She knows which nights they will go home alone and which nights they will walk too fast and which nights they will make a loved one of a stranger for a bit. She does not take them. She takes only the soft space at the edge of being taken: the lips.\n\nStreetlights oblige her. Sometimes they are kind, and the sodium makes the mouths golden as a harvest; sometimes they are brutal, and everything is blue and exact; sometimes the light is only the phone, and then the light is a kiss of its own. She hums, and the humming becomes a sound that young men do not know they hear and it makes them stand still for two seconds longer than they would have.\n\nThere are stories. Boys tell boys. They say there is a woman who looks at your mouth and you forget your name and for the next week you bite the inside of your cheek and it tastes like someone else\u2019s cigarettes. They say she brings luck. They say she is a monster. They say she is tall. They say she is a camera with a person attached. They say not to go over the bridge. They go over the bridge.\n\nMr Cook grows a habit that is not so different from his other habits. He walks home later. He will not admit to himself that he is looking for her because that would be romance, and he does not have the warranty for romance. He checks corkboards now. He sees more of the squares. Always the lips. Always a little name, a little detail. Harvey, Tollcross, whistles. Jamal, Holyrood, hates olives. Finn, Stockbridge, sings in the shower. He takes one. He leaves another. He is a thief and a curator. He has a tiny museum of mouths, ridiculous, secret.\n\n\u201cNo offence,\u201d Lorna says when she comes round one night because the heating is broken in her place and his is not, \u201cbut your walls are a wee bit bare for a person with feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a selection of photographs of people\u2019s mouths,\u201d he says, and waits for her to ask. She does not, lately. She has seen stranger. She warms her hands at his radiator and tells him about a man with a moustache that requires insurance.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with your life,\u201d she asks finally, not like a scold but like a friend who knows that life is a cupboard you avoid opening because the saucepan lids are waiting to jump out.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is probably it.\u201d He does not sound sad. It is not sad. There is so much to do, plates to catch, forks to deliver. Still. He presses his thumb against the edge of a photograph in the drawer and feels its small precise pain.\n\nOn a Wednesday that has not made up its mind to rain or not, the newspaper prints a story that is trying to be cheerful about the crime it is reporting. Missing: two young men last seen on separate streets. They are not the first missing. The city is a large, complicated cupboard. The paper cites family members. It uses the phrase out of character. It uses the phrase police appeal. It uses pictures taken from social media and the mouths in the pictures are of course there, loud and patterned with the imperfections that make all beauty possible.\n\nMr Cook eats his toast without tasting it and folds the newspaper twice and then again and then puts it out for the recycling as if it were a dangerous bottle. At work he pours a pint too quickly and has to let it settle like a mood. He does not speak. Lorna speaks. Lorna speaks enough for two. It helps. It almost addresses the problem. He is not stupid. He is arranging his fear on a shelf. He is also choosing a time and a place.\n\nHe walks down to Dean Village after midnight, when the stone looks like skin and the water looks like a language you half remember how to read. He waits on the path. Foxes skitter. Students skid. He waits. He does not call her name because he does not know it. He has named her three different things and none of them stuck. He waits.\n\nShe arrives like weather you hear about from other towns first. A smell of salt. The sense that the mass of the air has been miscalculated. He hears the strap of the camera before he sees her, the leather song of it. He stands up, because he had been sitting like a pen lid on a bench, and his legs are pins.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d she says, not surprised. \u201cYou are the waiter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are the proof,\u201d he says. His hands are at his sides. He would like to be much braver than he is and much stupider; he would like to be the person who runs at a giant with a broom handle shouting be off with you, foul spirit, be gone back to where you came from. He is not that person. He is a person with a good memory for orders. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had too many,\u201d she says, but he hears something in it this time, a slip, the echo of a letter. \u201cVictorine,\u201d she says eventually, and the name falls like a coin into a box that didn\u2019t know it was hungry. \u201cVictorine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cVictorine, I\u2019m asking you. You have to stop.\u201d\n\nShe looks at him as if he has asked her to take her heart out and boil it for tea. \u201cI am nearly done,\u201d she says. The pictures at her belt are thicker. The belt bows, tired under the weight of proof. \u201cI am making a gift. He will be complete soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d he says again, stubborn in the way a door is stubborn when the paint has stuck. \u201cWho is he.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was small,\u201d she says, as if she is reading from a list in her mind that is written in a child\u2019s handwriting. \u201cHe had a laugh like teeth. He kept money in his left shoe. He told jokes that were stolen from someone else and tried to blush when caught, but he could not. His mother called him a big daft boy in a way that meant stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d Mr Cook says gently, and he can hear it, the grief, the bigness of love that made a person huge because how else can you carry it, \u201chas a him like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd everyone is failing him. I will not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are disappearing,\u201d he says, each word a plate he cannot drop. \u201cBoys. Men. The newspaper. This is not nothing. I don\u2019t know what it is yet, but it\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not taking them,\u201d she says, scornful now and with a hurt that makes the river lower itself. \u201cI would never. I am collecting only the outer map of a voice. If something is happening it is happening without me.\u201d\n\nHe believes her. He hates that he does. He swears inwardly with small careful words. He looks at the black slots of the closes and at the lights in a few windows where the late ones draw. \u201cThen help me,\u201d he says, surprising himself with the taste of the word help. \u201cIf you know their routes and their habits, if you know their mouths you may know the rest. Help me find what is wrong. Please.\u201d\n\nShe is enormous and she is tender like a streetlamp in fog. She looks at him. \u201cYou are a waiter,\u201d she repeats, as if this were an ancestry.\n\n\u201cAnd you are a giant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are neither of us quite trained for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will do it anyway,\u201d she says. It is not a question, and in the not a question is all of the disaster and all of the devotion of what will happen next.\n\nShe gives him a photograph. He flinches because it feels like a kind of coupling, to be given something like that. It is a mouth with a little scar above it, a moon of a scar. It is labelled Kellan, Marchmont, left-handed. \u201cHe is missing,\u201d she says simply. \u201cHe did not come home. His brother cried in the street but he did not keep the tears. He wiped them on his sleeve and threw the sleeve away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat time,\u201d Mr Cook asks. He hates the procedural sound of him. He nods at his own nodding and dislikes himself. \u201cWhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d she says. \u201cAn hour after I saw him. He was merry. He was singing a song that told the street what it was, silly man. I took his lips. Then he was gone.\u201d\n\nThe river is loud as if it wants to be a witness. They stand like judges who are not allowed to sit and like children who are not allowed to speak. Mr Cook feels the hinge of his next few months seal.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cTell me everything. Every boy you saw that night. Every lip. Every wrongness.\u201d\n\nShe tells him. She has a memory like the city. Fussy. Fond. She does not miss a thing once she has decided it is worth not missing. He writes nothing down. He will keep it in his head for later. He will go back and back. He will ask questions that offend. He will dress them as if they were amuse-bouches and everyone will swallow them without thinking. He will stalk the way a waiter stalks during a rush \u2014 not predatory, not noble. Necessary.\n\n\u201cYou will get hurt,\u201d Victorine says by way of a benediction.\n\n\u201cI am perpetually already hurt,\u201d he says without self-pity and the night accepts that.\n\nShe rises as if the ground had been holding her by the ankle in a memory and lets go. He feels the shift of air. She is patient with her largeness. She treads lightly and still the city knows and the city forgives her. She goes and the bench is a bench again and the river is a river again and Mr Cook is a man in a coat who will now have to go and be more than a waiter and more than a man who owns eight photographs he would have to explain by leaving the country.\n\nIf you asked him to tell you the thing that began it all, he would say the fog moving and the camera sound, an old technology making a small creature noise. He would say the way her hand lifted, apologetic, and how his own hand did not lift back in fear. He would say he saw her love and it was bleeding out of her like light.\n\nHe would also say a very plain and silly thing, which is: He had had enough of being the one who cleared away what was left after. He wanted to be first at the table. He wanted to be the one who put something down on it that mattered. He put down his soul then. Or something like that. Something that looks like a napkin in the right light, folded a particular way. He would smile when he said it and you would not know whether to believe him or not. He would like that. He has always liked giving other people options.\n\nIn the weeks that follow, as the city keeps singing its long song about itself and the notices go up and down on noticeboards and the photographs travel in secret from a belt to a drawer to a fist, people will say there came a change. It is not a change anyone can nail to a date. It is not about weather though the weather does its part. It is the way doors are opened at different speeds. It is the way boys check the corners of their mouths for honesty. It is the way a waiter asks too many questions without making anyone feel interrogated.\n\nIt is the way a giant, who wanted only to collect enough light to call love true, finds herself participating in a hunt she did not intend and will pay for. It is the way a city, which is so old it should not be surprised by anything, takes a breath and holds it a long time.It begins with a map that is not a map, a paper placemat from the restaurant which Mr Cook has turned to the blank side and sectioned with a biro into neighbourhoods that only he recognises. He draws the Water of Leith like a vein he has learned how to find with two fingers and a patience learned from waiting for kettles. He dots pubs, and the long elastic places between them where boys stretch into their futures under streetlights and mistake the stretching for destiny. He writes names in margins and facts in the places where bread plates would go. It looks ridiculous. It is unshakeable.\n\nHe takes the placemat to the kitchen and tapes it under the bottom shelf where Lorna will not find it until she kneels to reach the last bag of sugar and then he will have to explain himself without warning. He likes the risk. It makes him feel like a person with a room in his life that is not visible from the front door. That room smells of warmed milk and pencilled lines and foxes crossing narrower spaces than you would think a fox could cross.\n\nThe first thing he learns is that he has already been learning all along. It turns out that watching the angle at which a man lifts his glass is not so different from watching the angle at which a man stops to check his reflection. It turns out that knowing which table wants to order dessert but needs to be told it is not embarrassing is the same skill as recognising which young man has decided to be brave because he has almost been caught by something and wants to prove the city wrong. He does not call the police because the police would do what the police do; he is doing harm reduction in a room that does not have a sign saying that. He carries in his head a list of other people\u2019s sons and the places their mouths were last known to be speaking.\n\nHe goes to Marchmont because Kellan had a scar, and scars have councils they belong to. He visits the shop where a woman sits behind a counter selling stamps and lottery tickets and invites good luck to cross the threshold in increments. He asks if she remembers a boy who paid for cigarettes with a five-pound note folded into a square as if it were a secret letter. She does not. He goes next door and asks a man who has cut the same heads of hair for twenty years to notice that the wind changed last week. The man says that boys come and go and that their mouths always smile when they look at themselves, never when they look at other people. The man is barber-cynical about it; he is not wrong, but he is lazy with the truth.\n\nThere is a bouncer outside a place with a name that suggests a speakeasy but which only speaks loudly. The bouncer has a stool he refuses to sit on because he does not intend to get comfortable. Mr Cook has brought him coffee before because kindness is a tourism guide that gets you behind the rope. He brings one now. He asks about Kellan without saying missing, and the bouncer\u2019s eyes put together the letters anyway and they move with a faint tiredness that looks like respect. He saw Kellan leave around one with two friends; one of the friends can sing any song that begins with a U, for a bet. They turned right, towards the Meadows. There was fog in that direction, a fog that looked like it had a schedule.\n\nIn the Meadows he finds trampled grass in round shapes where friends had sat themselves and their doubts in rings. He walks the paths and watches the mouths of the statues, because he is superstitious in a slow way, and he asks a hot chocolate truck if they recognise a boy with a scar. The hot chocolate truck has the manners of a small house; it invites and it sticks to its opinions. The woman working there says there were two lads who came late and asked for extra cream and wrote their initials on the lids like it was a contract. She had thought about it later because the initials were the same except for one letter and it felt like a game she wasn\u2019t a part of.\n\nIt is nothing. It is everything. He notes it on his placemat map when he gets home, the letter that was not the same, the cream that was extra as if sweetness were an armour. He does not sleep, but this is not important because sleep is a place he has lately disliked. In the morning he will take croissants from a paper bag that lies about its own flakiness, and he will butter them like forgiveness and feed himself the way one feeds a dog that has done something almost clever.\n\nVictorine does not have a map because she is the map. She has walked the city until the city walked her back, until she could tell you the taste of every bridge and the sound of every close when it swallows you and makes you echo. She did not intend to help. She intended to finish her book of proofs and go to a place where proofs do not matter because love once done does not undo. But he asked, and she is susceptible to questions asked without swagger. At first she tells herself she is merely aligning her routes to his. Then she stops telling herself anything and listens for new sounds.\n\nThere is one: a tutting in the fog that does not belong to her. It is the sound a mother makes when she recognises crumbs in her best bed. It comes from corners. It is not the city; it is something that wants to be spared the trouble of learning streets by taste. It is something that would borrow. That is how she thinks of it, not as a hunter, not as a killer, but as a borrower who returns things wrong-side-out if it returns them at all. The first night she hears it she gentles her large hands as if to hold it; the fog makes room for her and the room does not contain it.\n\nThere are stories now that have learned to travel without bodies. Lorna brings them to the back door with the bin bags and the lemon rinds. A boy said he heard his own voice on his phone by the canal, and he answered himself and agreed to meet to return a jacket he had not lost. A taxi driver swears that his last fare vanished while the lights were at red, which is not physically possible and so must be administrative. A girl with a tattoo of an anchor on her forearm said she had kissed a boy who tasted like photographs; she could not explain what flavour that was except that it made her teeth ache in a way she did not dislike. None of the stories are helpful until they are, and that is the problem with stories: they welcome you in and then they make you look at your watch and realise the dark has moved closer.\n\nMr Cook goes to the canal because stories like water. He stands in the gap between buildings where the wind becomes interested in scarves. He spends twenty minutes making small talk with a crow that is not invested. He watches a student rehearsing being unbothered by the cold by leaving his jacket open and looking at his phone in a way that says the phone is the heat source for his illusion. He sees, finally, what he did not know he was hoping to see; it is a man in a coat with the wrong shoulders.\n\nThe shoulders are not wrong in shape. They are wrong in understanding: the coat has been taught the meaning of shoulders by someone who has seen a picture of shoulders, perhaps drawn by a child, and the coat has studied it and passed the test and failed the practice. The hands holding the phone are fine; the hands cut the air like knives cutting air. The shoes, though. The shoes are the problem and the proof. They are black and plain and new and they are left and left. Both left. The gait is a stitch undone every step; the weight lands not heel-to-toe but heel-to-question-mark and you can see the mud trying to be polite about it and failing, flinging up its cheeks to avoid being trodden on by a riddle.\n\nHe does not follow because following has its glamour and its disaster and he would prefer to keep his disaster domestic. He lets the wrong-shouldered coat go, and he watches the student watching his phone begin to tilt his head as if he is hearing his name spoken at a distance in the voice of, perhaps, someone who once told him not to go out without a hat. Mr Cook moves then, very quickly. He is not strong and he is not violent, but he is precise and he is in the habit of interrupting. He walks directly up to the student and says, with a voice he uses when a plate is about to fall, that the jacket is not at the bridge. The student blinks, and because youth is the most superstitious thing going he believes what he has been told because it was told with confidence. He shrugs, rude by accident, and goes back indoors.\n\nMr Cook turns his head to see if the wrong-shouldered coat has turned its head. It has. The face is a face, entirely credible, the face of someone you would not describe if you were trying to describe the face of someone you would not remember. The mouth is wrong. Not visibly. Visibly it is perfect, as if chosen from a list that began with \u201cconvincing\u201d and ended with \u201cno query.\u201d But the tongue is unused to lying behind those teeth. His father had had a speech impediment that was not a stammer and not a lisp and was simply a relationship with consonants that required negotiation. This mouth has none of that. It has nothing. It is a mouth that arrived with instructions written in a handwriting nobody could read. It is suddenly, to Mr Cook, impossibly sad.\n\nHe goes home quickly, as if somebody were trying to catch up with him and might, if he slowed, ask him his name and he might tell them. He feeds his plants which do not require feeding but appreciate the theatre. He opens the drawer where the photographs live and counts them although he knows exactly how many there are. One is missing. He is not given to melodrama and he is at home and he is not admitting that the room is smaller than it was when he left it, but he shouts anyway, a wordless thing that is the sound he makes when a stack of plates goes and his body moves before his pride. He checks the floor, the radiator edge, the gap behind the bookshelf where crumbs go to plan their future. It is gone. The photograph of Aidan, Fountainbridge, likes sugar has removed itself like a card from a deck a magician has taught to think.\n\nHe thinks of calling Lorna because what is friendship if not calling someone when your photographs are escaping. He does not. He thinks of calling Victorine and cannot because he does not have a number or a way of speaking; he has fog and a river and a bench and weather. He goes to the bench. That night it rains in a committed fashion and he refuses to be impressed by it. His coat is not good enough for this sort of romance and he is wet the way a towel is wet after a hotel tries to persuade you that towels can be thin and loyal.\n\nVictorine arrives as if the rain were being generous for once and had decided to drape itself around her. He tells her about the photograph without drama because he has expended his drama on the floor looking for paper. She listens with the attention of someone reading a telegram the war wrote. She says, very quietly, that her pictures do not leave without her permission. He says that the city has never been good at permission. She kneels like a saint with terrible knees and reaches a hand into the bag at her belt and the bag reaches back, a little. She draws out the photograph he lost. It is heavier. It has a dampness around the edges that is not rain.\n\n\u201cWhere,\u201d he asks, less startled than he would have been last week. \u201cWhere did it go.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone wanted to see if the page could be turned backwards,\u201d she says. She cradles the square like bread. \u201cI think it learned the beginning of a trick. I think the trick will be dangerous when it has practiced.\u201d\n\nHe hates thinking about tricks when what he wants is to think about soup. There is no soup. There is fog and this woman and a river that behaves like an archive. He asks her if she has seen the wrong shoes. She nods with the same patience she uses when a boy bites his mouth and makes a little crescent that will be beautiful when it heals. She has. She sees them most on the edges of bridges. She has watched them stop as if choosing which names to taste next. They interest her in the way a wasp that will not leave the kitchen interests you if you are someone who refuses to close the window on principle.\n\nThey make a plan of the sort that will make people who want plans laugh. It involves chalk stolen from a pub quiz where the quizmaster uses it to draw pictures when the questions grow tired. It involves sugar, because Aidan likes sugar and the city has opinions about lure. It involves a fox, because of course it involves a fox. The chalk is for the stones by the bridge. The sugar is poured into a little drift near one of the lamp-posts that has learned to be kind. The fox has not signed anything, but Mr Cook has a relationship with a fox who knows his whistle and will come and take bread from his hand with the quick gentleness of someone who has learned to take quick, gentle things while the engines of the city are leaving.\n\nThey arrange the chalk into careless markings and then into careful ones disguised as careless ones. Victorine hums to the lamp-post and asks it to make its light a little warmer, just for an hour, and it agrees because it is flattered that someone has remembered to ask. The sugar waits. The fox also waits, which is not like a fox and suggests that the fox is not waiting for sugar, but for a story. Mr Cook hides, which is not like him, and is good practice for being something other than a waiter.\n\nThe wrong-shouldered coat comes the way a rumour comes when it is tired of being so light and would like to see what it feels like to be a body. It stops exactly where they thought. It breathes in, and you can see it take the breath seriously, as if breaths were money you had to account for. It speaks into the student night without opening its mouth. It speaks like an app that is ashamed of itself. It says a name that is not Mr Cook\u2019s. It says, Finn. It says, Finn, did you leave your card. It says it in a voice that is trying to be an apology and failing because it has not learned regret with any of the correct muscles.\n\nThe fox moves first. It pads to the sugar, pretends to be greedier than it is, and then sneezes, a small explosion like a cartoon that has chosen to be elegant. The sneeze does what a sneeze does: it removes illusions by forcing a pause. The wrong-shouldered coat turns further than a person turns, as if joints were a story rather than a law. It shows its shoes to the chalk. That is the point. The chalk records without being interested. The chalk writes down the way the weight moves, heel-spiral, heel-spiral, the way the left-left shoes make the gait into a harvest of mistakes. Victorine holds her patient breath and Mr Cook holds his and the city cannot, in fairness, hold its because it has too many lungs between it and the sea. The coat looks at the sugar and then not at the sugar, because there is a precision in the way it rejects human lure and it will not be tricked into sweetness. Mr Cook learns something he does not want: that what wants them does not want them because they are delicious, but because they are impossible.\n\nHe does not jump out. He does not reveal anything. He stands very still and lets the chalk do what chalk does. He sees the print of a sole that is brand-new and wrong. He sees, pressed into the heavy white, a pattern that is not a pattern: the heel bears letters, but the letters are nonsense. The letters say NO HAND. The letters are an instruction like the ones on packaging. He thinks, absurdly, of his towels: open the same way, like books ready at the library. He wonders if perhaps there is a library where this thing learned to be with us, and if the books were not alphabetised.\n\nThey do not catch it. They do not even get close. It slides away like a memo withdrawn before it can be pinned to a board. It does not mind that it has been observed because observation is not the same as interference and in the city you can die of being observed. They let it go. They keep the chalk, which is not nothing, and the way the light coloured the sugar for a second as if it were gold someone had dropped accidentally. Mr Cook kneels and touches one of the NO HAND letters. His finger is white for a bit and then the rain lifts it and returns him.\n\nVictorine retrieves from her belt a photograph that is not hers and not his. It is a mouth he does not know and a mole that is very exactly placed like a punctuation mark with perfect meaning. She says the name that belongs to it because the name is written on the back and the writing is someone else\u2019s; it is Kellan\u2019s brother\u2019s writing. The photograph had sat in a wallet. She did not steal it. It found its way to her because paper learns the shortcuts grief opens. She gives the picture to Mr Cook not because it will help but because sometimes you give the thing you cannot carry to someone who has volunteered to carry. He takes it like bread. He feels his life actively changing its hinge.\n\nLorna finds the placemat map because she is the kind of person who is chosen by drawer handles that jam and require a particular wrist to coax them. She is halfway through telling Mr Cook a story about a woman who ate half a lemon tart with her eyes closed because she wanted to prove to someone that she could feel pleasure without needing to locate it, when she sees the map. She stops and kneels and reads. She does not laugh. She says, Oh lamb, which is something she has not called him since the day he told her that he could not be the person other people needed him to be at breakfast. She folds the placemat carefully along the lines of the Water of Leith and tucks it into her bag without asking. He says nothing because consent has already been managed between them in a thousand small ways. She is in. He did not invite her because he is bad at inviting help; she is not waiting for his good behaviour.\n\nHer contribution is immediate and unappreciated by the part of Mr Cook that would like to be in charge. She goes to the places he cannot go because he is not a woman who can be angry in a way that opens doors. She asks bartenders and taxi drivers questions a woman asks when she is a friend of a friend\u2019s sister and she has a photograph and the photograph has light that tells the truth about who will miss a boy. She learns something Mr Cook could not have learned because men lie to men about fear and they tell women the truth in order to be allowed to continue to think of themselves as decent. She learns that a boy who hated olives disappeared near a bin that smelled of olives because the restaurant had put them out with the coffee grounds. She learns that there is someone who calls himself a promoter who promotes nothing; he stands outside clubs and asks for names and pretends to know everyone. He wears scarves to summer events and in winter he tries being serious. He is not the wrong-shouldered coat. He is a different, older wrongness, and she flicks him away like a coat made of a wish that never came true.\n\nVictorine watches all this with a complicated affection that she is careful not to show. She has been told her whole life not to be too much of anything; she is the definition of too much and she is the opposite of it. She comes when called by whistles, by changes in pressure, by a boy\u2019s mother sitting on a doorstep and finally letting a sound out that had been in her for twenty-four years and needed a witness. She does not take pictures of mothers. She takes pictures of boys. She tells herself it keeps the scale right because otherwise she would be too moved and break her own camera with her hands. Sometimes, at night, alone on a roof where the city reminds itself it has vertebrae, she holds one of the squares to her cheek and the cheek remembers the temperature it is missing.\n\nShe had a childhood, which is not obvious, and it is relevant now apparently because she cannot stop thinking of the man she loved when she was a size you would call manageable. His name is not for here, as before, but he had a mouth like a comma. He would begin and then pause and then finish and she had loved that about him because she had thought it meant he was thinking, and perhaps it did. He had been taken from the world not by any of the dramatic things that make stories easier to tell; he had been taken by a sequence of small errors nobody owned. She is making a book of lips because someone somewhere had to own something about it and she, it turned out, had hands big enough to hold the blame without it piercing the skin.\n\nThe city remains itself and then more itself. It has always had a taste for repetition and now it repeats warnings in new fonts. Someone writes on a wall with chalk that says Do Not Answer Your Name After Midnight. Someone else writes underneath, Unless You Are Hungry, and someone else crosses that out and writes Unless You Are Very Hungry, and someone else writes Unless It Is Your Mother, and beneath it, If It Is Your Mother Make Her Prove It By Telling You a Secret Only Your Dentist Knows. Someone adds, Teeth, and underlines it twice with a flourish that suggests a person in love with solutions. It is funny until it is not. It is not the sort of funny that warms. It is the other kind.\n\nMr Cook has to work, and there is a Saturday that behaves like a pizza oven. He is very good. He is extraordinary. He moves like a song about knives that is not threatening, just informative. He looks at mouths constantly. It is a problem. He spills nothing, which is suspicious. He asks too many questions and nobody minds because he does it with the generosity that makes you forget the shape of the question and remember only that you enjoyed answering. A table of four boys are celebrating a birthday and pretending not to. He watches them blow out a candle in a way that makes the air think about staying. He watches them put on their coats and choose the order in which to check their pockets for keys, phones, pride.\n\nWhen they leave he breaks his rule and follows them at a professional distance. He hates himself for it because it feels like surveillance and he is a waiter not a policeman and the word policeman tastes like a spoon in a chipped cup. He walks on the other side of the street. He listens. He hears, astonishingly, the city trying to help. A bus coughs exactly when one of the boys says his own name. A siren runs past at the moment the boy repeats it. The sound covers the slip. The boys do not notice. He thinks of sending the bus a letter. He thinks that perhaps the city is on their side for now because it likes a hunt when it has time for one.\n\nIn the moment he most dislikes the man he has become, one of the boys turns and looks right at him and says, You all right, mate, in a kindness he did not expect. He likes the boy\u2019s mouth because it is the shape of a mouth that has just learned how to say sorry and also how to mean thank you so much. He is not a thief, so he lets them go. He walks in the opposite direction and is punished immediately by stumbling into a small crowd that has arranged itself around a guitarist doing something with his thumb that should be illegal. He tries to pass. The guitarist sings a name that is not Mr Cook\u2019s and is and always will be, and for a second there is a heat in the back of his eyes that is either grief or the first great love of his life arriving late and furious. He stands his ground. He puts his hands in his pockets and counts his coins and his breath, one, two, three, four. The song misses its chance.\n\nThe chalk prints by the bridge survive one more rain and then are gone, but Mr Cook has them, because of course he does. He has them because Lorna, who is tired of everyone's tendencies towards metaphor when what is needed is an action that can be ticked off, pressed a sheet of brown butcher's paper down hard and peeled it up slow so that the chalk came with it like a bruised sky. The letters NO HAND transferred themselves as if they were bored where they were and fancied travel. She pins the paper to the back of her bedroom door and tells her cousin that it is a mood board. Her cousin believes her because her cousin is too young to have learned to doubt doors.\n\nThere is a day when the police come to the restaurant, and a day when they do not. On the day they do, they are new-faced and grieved by the thought of bureaucracy. They ask questions and Mr Cook answers all the ones that are sensible and none of the ones that are not because he cannot bear to say aloud that he thinks there is something wearing our lids and trying not to spill while it walks. He gives them coffee on the house and they try not to accept it and fail and he reads their mouths and sees that they are brave in the way that means they are going to get tired too soon. On the day they do not come, he goes to Dean Village and whips his eyes along every second like a jockey on a temperamental horse.\n\nIt happens quietly, because that is the signature being used. A boy appears where there was not a boy. He walks as if he is not sure whether he is here by anyone\u2019s permission but his own. He has a mouth Victorine has not yet taken and she feels the absence like a tooth she cannot stop touching with her tongue. He stops at the bridge because that is what boys do at the bridge; they stop and they decide whether to go on or to think and they mistake both for action. Victorine drops to one knee and the cobbles press back a complaint and in that moment the boy looks up, peering into fog he cannot parse, and the wrong-shouldered coat appears behind him with its hands in the wrong pockets. Mr Cook moves in a way that would embarrass him if the only witness were not someone who makes mistakes for a living. He moves between the boy and the coat, a small kindness in a bad corridor.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, and he does not recognise his voice as his. It is not the one he uses to comfort people about cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It is the one that used to persuade him to get out of bed. \u201cYou\u2019ve dropped something,\u201d he lies, because it is the best he can do, and the lie is a thread and threads are not heroic but they hold buttons on shirts when it matters.\n\nThe wrong-shouldered coat stops because it likes games. It looks down. The boy looks down. The only thing there is a dead leaf that has adhered to the stone with the tenacity of the complimentary mint that will not leave a cheque. Mr Cook leans and peels it up and hands it to the boy with an expression that says, please go along with this through the grace of our shared humanity. The boy takes the leaf and smiles because the world is still, despite everything, sometimes gentle, and he says thanks, mate. He goes, not quickly, not neatly, but he goes, and the coat tilts its head as if someone has asked it if it believes in a god that is personal. It breathes in and whatever it smells does not satisfy it. It breathes out and it does not make steam.\n\nVictorine does not take the boy\u2019s mouth. She lets it live unproven for later. She looks at Mr Cook and Mr Cook looks at her and he thinks that there are worse partnerships than one between a giant who cannot say small things and a waiter who can make anything sound like an offer rather than an order. He is going to get hurt. She already is. The city, which listens, sets down another layer of fog like kitchen paper under a birdcage and tells itself that it is absorbing something it does not yet understand.\n\nNews breaks as if news were an egg in the hands of someone who cannot be bothered to crack it with care. Another boy missing, a photograph of a mouth on a wall that has the caption Do You Know Him and the comments beneath it that say not helpful things in the upward-tilting shapes of online. Mr Cook stops reading the comments. He keeps walking. Lorna starts wearing two scarves, as if colours could be a brace. Victorine takes a picture of a mouth and feels, in the camera\u2019s weight, a shift that is not gravity. She is being followed. Not by wrong shoes; by something more common and more dangerous: consequence.\n\nThe thing that borrows has learned something new. It made a call last night to a boy called Jamie, and it used the voice of his grandmother perfectly, and it said, I found your watch and I\u2019ve put it in the blue dish, love, and Jamie laughed and said, Gran, you don\u2019t know how to text, and the voice said, I learned, because it is not proud. Jamie went home at once to check the blue dish because hope is the most obedient of all the animals and his grandmother is dead and he knows it and still the blue dish called to him. He stood in his hall with his bag on his shoulder and his coat half-off and he did not cry because if he cried there would be salt in the room and salt is honest and he is not ready. He slept in his coat on the sofa because sleep is a thing you have to do near the place you thought something would be.\n\nMr Cook does not know this story yet. He will, because all the small true things get to him eventually. For now he has a placemat map, a photograph with a mole, a sheet of brown paper with shoe letters, two scarves to follow in a crowd, a fox who sneezes on cue, and a giant who hums to light. He has more than he has ever had. He also has the beginning of a dread that does not resemble any of the others he has practiced. He has always feared embarrassment and failure and unkindness and the kind of chaos that lets you think you can fix it until you realise it is sleeping in your bed. This new fear has a quieter appetite. It would like to take everybody\u2019s name out of their mouths and put it somewhere safe where safety is the same as silence.\n\nIt is a Tuesday when he realises the thing he should have realised on a Sunday. He is polishing cutlery with a cloth that has lost its patience, and he is listening to the clock refuse to keep up, and he is moving in the spaces between one order and the next, and he hears Lorna call his name and it buzzes his skin in a way it does not usually. He feels the shape of it along his nerves. He looks up and she is smiling because there is a customer who has asked to see the person who made their evening better by being specific about the bread. He thinks, without wanting to, about leaving his name somewhere the wrong-shouldered coat could step on it. He thinks about writing down something that does not last and handing it over and calling it proof. He goes to the table and he is good and he is funny and he is kind and then he is out in the alley breathing and tasting rosemary from the kitchen and the air tastes also of something like new plastic and he understands that the thing he is hunting will try to get him in the way of a gift.\n\nHe finds Victorine that night by walking into the old train tunnel where the city keeps its ghosts, and the ghosts do not mind because he steps carefully. He tells her what he understood about gifts. She nods and says that all stories about riddles begin with presents that aren\u2019t. He nods and hates that this is the shape. They are going to have to offer something to take something. They are going to have to put something on the table. He laughs a little, not because it is funny but because he has always liked tables. He says, all right, and hears his own voice like a drawer closing after everything has been put in the wrong place on purpose.\n\nThey set it up like a service. They choose a night when the fog has rubbed itself raw against streetlamps. They choose a bridge that has learned to forgive apologies that come too late. They choose a boy who will not be hurt because he does not exist except in the way all of us exist in other people\u2019s stories. They choose a name that belongs to no one because it belongs to too many. They choose Finn because the city has a taste for repetition and they will use it against itself. They do not tell Lorna because she will make it better and safer and they have left themselves no room for better or for safe.\n\nMr Cook stands where the sugar was and where the chalk was and where the wrong shoulders had been. He wears a scarf Lorna would approve of and shoes that are right and make the right noise. He takes his phone out and places it on the parapet face-up like an offering and he steps back and he waits. He does not call. He does not say his name. He makes himself into an answer. It is not wise. It is the only thing that makes any sense to him, and sense is a thing he trusts when he does not trust good sense.\n\nVictorine becomes a building. She stands inside the fog like a keel and the fog obliges and drapes itself. She holds her camera with her finger on the lip of it as if she were about to say shh. The fox waits in the hedge pretending to be a hedge. The city attends, not for them, but because this is a thing it knows how to do: it can be an audience for need. The wrong-shouldered coat comes as if it has been invited by a letter written in a hand that has practiced for hours and still gets its capital Ks wrong and is proud of that. It reaches for the phone. It does not aim to take it. It aims to learn it. It aims to taste what it means to put your face near a small metal lake and wait for your reflection to say yes.\n\nVictorine moves and the camera does something it was not designed to do and could not do in any other hands; it inhales. The square inside it hungry to become is hungry earlier than it is given permission to be. The picture takes the shape of the wrongness and the wrongness dislikes being made into paper. It pulls away. It leaves behind, as all frightened things do, a piece of itself that can be put in a pocket. It is small and it is soft and it is a thin black ribbon that smells of wet cardboard and of someone else\u2019s breath. Mr Cook does not touch it because he has learned a lot of things very quickly, and one of them is that you do not put your hands in bags that are waiting to find out what they are.\n\nVictorine does not pick the ribbon up. She looks at it as if it had prayed and she is not the right goddess. She hums. It hums back in a frequency made of needles. The fox sneezes and ruins the seriousness. Mr Cook laughs because if he does not laugh he will have to make a sound he is not ready to own. The wrong-shouldered coat is gone in the way you learn to be gone when someone has taken your copy and you are not sure which world the copy will be truer in. The phone on the parapet lights up because it has been watching like a child under a blanket and wishes to be in the conversation.\n\nThey do not win. They arrange, instead, a very small defeat for an enemy who cannot be certain yet that it can be defeated at all. They do not bless themselves because they have different religions, both of which are mostly about not getting in the way of what is beautiful. They pick up the ribbon with a fork, because there are rules, and they take it to the restaurant kitchen and place it in a stainless steel bowl that has heard confessions. The ribbon tastes like a lie you told in Year Eight that adjusted your life just enough that you cannot get back to the other you. They watch it for an hour. It does nothing you can see. It is trying to learn a phone number.\n\nAfter, Mr Cook walks Lorna home along a road they have named between them because naming roads keeps them honest. He does not tell her about the ribbon yet. He tells her a different truth in exchange, which is that he is tired of not being the first person at any table that matters. She says, old news, and she is so kind with it that he nearly stops to put his head against her shoulder. He does not. He keeps walking because if he stops now he will have to examine the ribbon in the bowl and decide whether he has become a scientist or a thief or a priest and he does not want to be any of those things before a late night service.\n\nAt home, he opens the drawer with the photographs and counts again and touches the edges and informs them that he is not their father. He tells them they are visiting. He tells them they can stay as long as they remember that they are guests and that he will put them out with the recycling if they begin to lie. He is ridiculous. The pictures are paper. He tells himself that after all of this is over he will sell everything he owns that can hold a reflection and live like a monk except for the radio. He will never do that. He loves radios. He will buy another one. He will place it on the counter among the spoons and tell it news he has partly invented so it can play him music he did not know he needed.\n\nVictorine crosses the city with the ribbon in her camera and the camera heavier because it is keeping a thing it does not like. She climbs the Scott Monument at dawn and pretends she is not. The stone notices and approves the effort. She stands where men with hats once decided to be brave in a way that involved being rude to people who wrote with their left hands. She unwraps the ribbon and lets the wind smell it. The wind is excellent at naming things, better than any god. It is the first to tell her the word she has been avoiding because to have a name is a blessing and a risk. It says, Borrower, and then it says, Not Exactly, and then it invents a word that cannot be spelled in human alphabets because it requires a letter that looks like a door you can walk through only once. She accepts the failure. She hates to fail. She holds the ribbon in the air and says, quietly, the name she never says and the love that made her big bends through the morning like someone taking a shortcut through a field.\n\nThe ribbon flutters. It has learned one thing. It has learned that if it says a name with enough sincerity, doors will open the size of mouths. It says Victorine. It says it perfectly, on the first try, with the exact weight her mother gave it and the exact tilt her lover used when he had seen something he enjoyed about it. She almost drops the ribbon, not because she is frightened of it, but because she is frightened of the exactness of her own longing. She puts it away. She decides not to die today of being understood by the wrong thing.\n\nIn the afternoon the sky lies flat on the city like someone resting their face on a cool table. Messages travel; the wrong ones are popular. The posters with the mouths fade. Mr Cook takes them down and puts them up again and takes them down and puts them up again because destroying and saving are how we pass the time before the solution. He can feel, in his bones that were his mother\u2019s shoulders on his father\u2019s frame, the moment approaching when they will have to cease harm reduction and commit a harm. He does not know what it will be. He does not know if it will be the wrong one. He suspects he will do it anyway and apologise to the air later the way he apologises to tables he bumps into.\n\nBy the river, a boy with a scar above his mouth that looks like a moon stands and waits. He is not Kellan. He is not anyone they know yet. A fox carries bread as if it were a bag full of money and looks at him in a way that suggests that this time the fox is the emissary and the boy is the message. Victorine watches from a place that cannot be a place and Mr Cook reads the menus of the night and orders something small and sharp and costly. He cannot keep a line in his head to save it. He keeps the whole city instead, because sometimes the big thing is easier to hold than the small. The fog returns and sighs and arranges its face into a new expression. The game has learned itself. The stakes are small and human and the city is going to make itself smaller to fit them. The camera hums. The chalk waits for its next life. The ribbon dreams of keys. The door the wind named shifts a fraction in a hinge nobody can see.Morning does not so much arrive as decide to be generous with visibility, and Mr Cook stands in the quiet restaurant with the radio speaking its lettered weather like a priest of tides. He polishes glasses with a cloth that knows his hands and listens to the litany \u2014 Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire \u2014 and thinks that perhaps the sea would understand a thing that calls you by your name and expects the obedience of boats. He has put the stainless steel bowl under a shelf where it will hear the radio but not see the door, because sight is a luxury and listening is work. Inside the bowl the thin black ribbon behaves itself the way children behave when they have plans that require nobody to watch them. He taps the rim of the bowl the way one taps a sleeping cat, light and apologetic, and the ribbon does not move, but he feels, along the bones that run like a sentence down his forearms, the moment a number fails to reach the person who wanted it.\n\nLorna arrives carrying a bag that clucks with knitting needles and indignation. She has tied one of her scarves in a way that makes the colours listen to one another rather than fight, and he sees that there are small stitches near the ends where a person with patience has embroidered letters that could be names if you wanted them to be, or could be rivers, if you were the sort of person who declined to be specific in case specificity made you vulnerable. She says nothing about the bowl because she has told herself that she will be told, and he sees the restraint and loves her for it in the precise way you love a person who knows that what you are doing is too much and refuses to say the sentence that begins with stop. She goes into the bar and rearranges thirty glasses by one-quarter inch because there is safety at that scale and then she leans on the counter and says, conversationally, that her cousin\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s pal knows a man who was asked last week for two left shoes.\n\nThe cobbler in Stockbridge wears magnifying lenses that make his eyes serious as clocks. He works in a narrow room that has the atmosphere of somebody who solved a great problem once and would like to be asked how. He passes the butcher\u2019s brown paper print through his hands in a way that does not smudge the chalk and smiles a small private smile at the letters. NO HAND, he says it like a blessing that got its pronunciation wrong, and explains that certain manufacturers stamp their cartons with warnings intended for forklifts and human wrists, NO HAND TRUCK, NO HAND FEED, NO HAND HERE, and that sometimes glue is impatient and marries rubber when no one is watching. He says he has seen shoes mispaired because people mispair and that he does not believe in curses, which is what people say when they have a drawer full of countercurses labelled lace ends. He saw a man two weeks ago bring in a pair of black trainers and ask for both to be altered, both left, both to match, and the man had shoulders that did not introduce themselves properly to their coat. He remembers this not because the man was odd, but because the man tipped badly, and the cobbler keeps his lists with the same fidelity he uses with soles.\n\nThey walk out into a brightness that makes the pavements confess their stains, and Lorna, who has come because she insisted on coming, says that the cobbler smelled like almonds and worry. Mr Cook carries the butcher\u2019s paper like a hymn and thinks that this, this little piece, could be enough to thread into the city and pull. Victorine does not come into the shop because she has learned that even in a city that acts like an auntie, the sight of a woman who has been threaded by love into too much is a problem for ceilings. She waits around the corner with a fox that has the lack of manners of a creature that has never made a booking and watches people walk past her coat as if it were a ship\u2019s sail drying, which is, in the most literal sense, true. The ribbon inside her camera has behaved since dawn with a politeness that worries her, because politeness in wrong things often signals calculus.\n\nThey follow the cobbler\u2019s memory as if it were a string tied to a tin can two children speak into. The string leads to a place that calls itself a warehouse because the city will forgive a person anything except pretension, and inside the warehouse are boxes that believe they will be asked to live again as wardrobes and tables and not as coffins for whatever the night has been doing. The manager wears keys that hit one another like a friendly argument when he moves and tells Lorna that yes, they do receive consignments of shoes in bulk, no, they do not sell pairs, yes, sometimes film people come and buy six lefts for a shot they are lying about, no, he does not ask questions because the warehouse is a church of second chances and the offertory bowl does not interrogate the hands. Lorna flirts with a shelf the way she flirts with anyone who could give her answers, and the shelf does not hold out, but the clipboard on a hook near the door does, because paper loves betrayal. There is an order, dated wrong because someone typed with a finger that thought yesterday was today, for twelve left black trainers, size nine, for a production whose name is borrowed from a poem and therefore not trustworthy.\n\nVictorine\u2019s names do not like buildings like this. They curl back inside her chest when she steps through and bloom again when she steps out, as if air that has been kept too long under a roof has lost the quality that lets names ride it without complaint. She hates this room without blaming it; it is a hoarder of the things the night has lost and she is enough of a night to recognise kin. The ribbon in her camera lifts itself like a hair that has decided to notice static, and, very gently, she presses the heel of her thumb against the lip of the lens and says, as if to a child, that they are not doing this here because not every fight needs an audience that would pay the wrong sort of attention. The ribbon flattens and pretends to be well again.\n\nIn Morningside there is a woman whose students used to call her Miss Sing and whose neighbours call her June because June is the name you choose if you plan to offer lemonade on days that become themselves. She taught choirs how to turn the wheel of air into sound without fraying their throats and how to carry their names to the back row of halls without spilling them on the way. Victorine thinks of her suddenly when the ribbon says her own name and she hears, in the exactitude, the ache of potential misuse. They go to June\u2019s door because you must collect experts even if your expertise is grief. June opens before they knock because she is conducting her kettle and knows when to drop a bar. She looks at Victorine with a satisfaction you feel when a myth keeps an appointment and at Mr Cook with a kindness that belongs to people who feed people. She does not ask them to sit, because talk sitting is the wrong shape for what they have brought, and she says, in a voice that has not forgotten how to stand, that there are three ways to avoid answering to the wrong call and none of them is cowardice.\n\nThe first is to choose a name that is too heavy to be lifted by anything but love, which is why men in uniform say their last names and lovers say anything but. The second is to carry a hum in your mouth so that when strangers put their fingers in the latch and try to open you, they find the house already singing its own music and get bored. The third is to borrow a name you can afford to lose and wear it like a coat you expect rain for. June says all of this while slicing bread as if the slice were the rest note between chorus and verse, and Mr Cook hates that the answer is both actual and impractical. He tells her that the boys already hum because music is the thing that turned into breath and back again every Saturday for ten years. June nods, because she has seen boys lean their faces over scores with expressions like cliff-edges, and she goes to her dresser and removes a box of old badges from a time when badges were ways to identify yourself to each other and not to authority. She gives them three, each stamped with a word that is not a name and therefore can be spent safely. Mr Cook\u2019s says Always, because he is, and Lorna\u2019s says Loud, because she is, and Victorine\u2019s says Gentle, because it is the thing she is whenever anybody allows her the space.\n\nThey leave June with the promise of cake when this is over and walk out into a day that is pretending to be simple by being complicated in the small ways and Mr Cook tries the badge on and hears in his chest a shift that is not magic but is something like posture. At a corner he pauses because his phone has had an idea about ringing. He looks at the screen and sees his first name there like a tooth he does not touch and feels a jealousy for it he cannot defend. He has not given it to anyone for months. He does not answer. He stands and breathes through the urge to be polite to wrong numbers and the screen stops shouting with the grace of something that has not yet learned persistence.\n\nNight is how the city admits it has opinions, and that night the opinions concern bridges. North Bridge is tired of being dramatic; South Bridge would like to be acknowledged for its usefulness; the little bridges had decided the word is causeway. They go back to the place where chalk remembered letters and sugar pretended to be a trap. Lorna carries a bag that would get her arrested if anyone looked into it without context and Mr Cook carries context, which is to say explanations, which he intends to use only if it becomes necessary to be forgiven by someone in a hat. Victorine carries her camera with the strap against her neck in a way that makes it look light and is a lie. They have a plan that could be described as amateur if amateur came from love and the will to offer rather than command. It involves June\u2019s hum and a piece of butcher\u2019s paper and the knowledge of where men stop to be a little daft before they find home.\n\nAt eleven, the ribbon makes an attempt. It lifts its end within the camera as if greeting a host who has learned to cook one dish well. Victorine closes her hand around the camera\u2019s belly and says, No, and if you have never heard a woman who is allowed to be that large say No, you cannot know how tender a refusal can be and still strip paint. The ribbon droops like ivy that has discovered the wall is temporary. Mr Cook blows into his cupped hands because superstition and cold are equal co-authors, and Lorna ties a scarf around his throat and tucks into it the bottom edges of his jaw with the decisiveness of somebody wrapping a wound. They wait. They are very good at waiting now, which is not universally to be celebrated.\n\nIt appears not in the wrong coat but in a better one. The shoulders have done their homework. The shoes have learned to apologise for themselves by scuffing where scuffs should be and Mira down the row of tenements has left her radio on just enough that it can admit there is such a thing as jazz. What gives it away is the way it looks at the river and cannot read it. People who have lived here, even for a season, can read the black of the Water of Leith the way you read a menu \u2014 knowing where the prices are and where the small print hides. This thing looks and sees only a straight line you could step over if you were allowed to step. It speaks into the fog and the fog rolls like a cat saying perhaps. It says a name. It says Michael, in a voice that would make you hand a person your wallet and your summer if you were twenty-two and the last text you sent said where are you.\n\nJune taught them the hum, and the hum is not a tune, it is a continuousness, a vowel you choose for its roundness and its stubbornness, and Mr Cook takes it into his mouth and puts it against his teeth like a coin to check its metal and then he hums and Lorna hums and Victorine hums and the bridge takes the hum and passes it along and the fox yawns because the fox is a critic. The name Michael does not find a latch to lift. The coat waits as if patience were a religion it is trying out because it wants somewhere to sit. The ribbon behaves. The camera breathes through its own lungs for once. Mr Cook feels the hum as work and work is his faith and he keeps it going and feels the way the name slides off like rain made and failed.\n\nIt changes tactics because that is the particular intelligence of things that borrow; they change without growing. It speaks not into the fog but into the phone in Mr Cook\u2019s pocket, or rather into the air that phones arrange around themselves like a small arena. He feels the vibration in his coat and he does not move because movement is how you admit the call belongs to you, and he hums louder and the city hums back because buses make that noise when they leave you anyway, and the wrong-shouldered coat is suddenly less elegant. It steps forward in a way you would call decided if you were in a meeting, and Lorna steps in front of Mr Cook because habit is not hierarchy. She says a word that is not a name. She says Enough, and the coat falters because you cannot persuade a table to hold more plates than it has legs for and you cannot pull more names out of a mouth than it has space. The fox sneezes with exquisite timing and if this were a play you would accuse the director of cheapness but it is life so you accept it as an angel.\n\nVictorine lifts the camera and lets it inhale, and the inhalation is careful, and the square that comes into being is not of a mouth but of the line between the wrong shoulder and the wrong sense of gravity. It slides out slowly, shy for once, and she presses her thumb to it and feels beneath the gloss the whirring of something that does not enjoy being turned into a square. The coat retreats with the dignity of a person who will write an email later and CC everyone, and they do not chase it because chasing is plot and plots are for people who enjoy being in danger in a manner that can be summarised in five sentences for friends later. The new square dries with the reluctance of a child putting on a jumper and when she holds it to the light you can see, unmistakably, the edge of a foot and the imprint NO HAND in mirror and upside down but faithful.\n\nThey do not win, not exactly, but they lift a thread and knot it where it cannot be pulled without something else loosening. They go back to the restaurant and put the new picture on the steel beside the ribbon and they watch the two of them be near without acknowledging each other, the way two cousins do who have been seated together at a wedding and have decided on a truce until speeches are done. Mr Cook listens to the radio and lets his name be a rock at the bottom of running water. Lorna pours salt into the bowl in a ring not because she believes in salt but because believing in salt is a good use of hands. Victorine leans her head against the refrigerator door and closes her eyes, and because she is very tired, the world shifts an inch to make that not hurt.\n\nThe notices go up on more boards and the city invents new ways to avoid saying itself. Bus drivers switch to numbers and whistles. The bar in Tollcross calls last orders by raising a green cloth instead of a voice. People pin badges to their coats that say words that make no sense out loud because sense is edible. June\u2019s choir returns, not as a choir, but as thirty separate people who know how to stand and breathe and they become, over a week, a line of humming that runs along every bridge at night. It is ridiculous and beautiful, and if you are cynical about beautiful ridiculousness you should be careful not to live near the sea because the sea is not interested in you.\n\nThere is a small success which would not be reported by any paper with the courage to call itself a paper: a boy called Jamie wakes at two because his phone lit up the sofa where he fell asleep with his coat on and he hears his grandmother say, love, the watch, and he gets as far as the hall where the blue dish waits because dishes are patient and he stops because in his mouth is a ribbon of hum that he did not intend and that has been lent to him by men he has not met and women he would be frightened of and a fox who sneezed for comedy. He stands there and does not answer and his phone gives up because it is not brave, it is a phone, and he goes back to the sofa and puts his hand in his coat pocket and finds the watch he had thought was lost and cries a little, only a little, because he is twenty and tears embarrass him still and he will come here later, with flowers, to the table where this was planned, and he will not say thank you because he will not know, and that is the correct kind of magic.\n\nIt cannot last. If you have ever held a pattern in place for an hour you will know that hour costs a day. They wake a sleeping thing that is not the Borrower Not Exactly but the part of the city that disapproves of volunteer projects. A policeman with a young face and a boss with an older voice comes to the restaurant and asks for them to stop humming at bridges because it is creating a nuisance, bicycles cannot pass safely, someone is going to fall in and then where will we be. Lorna makes tea and puts it in front of them with the gentleness she keeps for the kind of argument that can be won without anyone losing their pride, and Victorine sits very still because one of the men is afraid of heights and she is higher than his nervous system will allow for. Mr Cook uses his voice in the way he uses a napkin, to wipe away the part of the mess that can be wiped, and tells the young policeman that the humming will move to the Meadows for a week because variety is good for lungs and he will write a letter about railings on bridges because nothing deters the part of danger that is boredom like ironwork.\n\nLorna sees it first because she was always going to: the picture of Kellan\u2019s scar, the one like a thumbprint of the moon above his lip, is fading at its left edge. It is not water damage. It is the precise slow removal of a margin, as if someone were gently recalling consent. She tells Mr Cook without the part where she would like to swear and he holds the picture as if he were holding the edge of a chipped plate which will shatter if you put it down wrong and then you will have to say you were the person who did that. They watch the silver of the paper try to become blank and they ask themselves, out loud and then quiet, what in the name of every ridiculous saint that forgives the ridiculous is happening. Victorine presses the picture to her cheek and then to the part of the camera that could be called its heart, and then she does the thing she seldom does which is to ask for help without making it sound like a proposition. She looks at the ceiling, which is a way of looking at the city inside, and says, please.\n\nThe city does not answer in words because words are expensive when you are that old. It answers in arrangement. The lights discriminate not at all and then exactly, making a spill here and a shadow there. The oven decides to be honest about its temperature. The radio chooses the shipping forecast again, and this time the voice is not wrong and not right, but careful. In that care they hear the place to go. It is not written on a map that admits it is a map, but Mr Cook already has a map that makes no apologies for being made out of a placemat. It points his finger to Leith, where the water can be touched without trespass, and to a warehouse that is not the one with the keys but the one made of brick that thinks it is a ship. Lorna says she is coming and he says of course and neither of them looks at Victorine because they are not noble; they are practical, and noble people die because they were busy being noble at the wrong moment.\n\nThey take bolt cutters because Lorna has a cradle of cousins at her disposal and one of them loves to know he is needed. They take a torch and then another, because the first will fail at the moment narrative requires it, and they take biscuits because Lorna is not stupid. The fox goes with them because it has decided this is the troupe it belongs to now and someone has to be in charge of stealing eggs when they return triumphant and hungry. Victorine goes by the high roads because her shadow is a currency she is not willing to spend near police vans, and she tells the city in her big kind way that they are not breaking; they are opening. The city, which has made worse puns, allows it.\n\nThe warehouse smells of rope that has retired unwillingly and of oil that has decided it would rather be soap. The door does its job and resists until reason persuades it that drama is inappropriate and then it yields with a civility that suggests it will ask for an apology later. Inside are stacked cages for things that have already had names, and boxes for things that never will, and there is, worse than anything, an arrangement of coats on a pipe that might be shoulders and might be ghosts. Lorna shines the torch and the light makes the coats look as if they have chosen to be seen and this is a decision nobody should have to live with. Mr Cook feels his mouth become a stranger for the second time in a week and checks with his tongue that his teeth are his and finds that they are and that this, too, is a luxury.\n\nThey find the radio first because the radio wants to be found; it is tuned to a frequency between music and the hiss fishes make when they are being listened to by something with no skin. It speaks names with the accent of a person learning how to ask for a glass of water in a language not their own, proudly, then with an apology, and Mr Cook steps forward and pulls the plug out with a theatricality he did not know he had, and is bitterly disappointed to find that the sound continues because electricity is not the god here, attention is. He takes the radio and places it in a bag and ties the bag shut because sometimes gesture is the way forward and Lorna reaches up and unties the bag again because she is not sentimental and removes the batteries and pockets them and snaps the bag shut as if she has broken the back of a gnat.\n\nThere is a table beneath the pipe of coats. It has a cloth thrown over it that believes this is a dinner party and that the late arrival will be handsome and clever and bear wine as a personality trait. On the table is a bowl. It is blue. It is not a blue that belongs to a shop. It is the blue of that bowl and only that bowl, the one on the radiator in a flat where somebody lived and took off their rings to wash vegetables and placed them in this exact circle and put them back on and carried on not thinking about the fingers that carried them. The bowl is empty. The bowl is reverent. Victorine puts her hand around the outside of it and thinks that if somebody took away every proof of a life but the temperature their bowls remembered, she could reconstruct love and hunger perfectly. Mr Cook does something he will always confess to later as the moment he conceded he was not a person who remained in the shallow end; he touches the inside of the bowl with his fingertip and a temperature answers him, tepid as someone who waited and decided not to be angry about it. He takes the bowl gently and wraps it in Lorna\u2019s scarf and she does not protest because her heart has made room for a shrine.\n\nThey do not see the wrong-shouldered coat enter because this time it decides on stairs and it knows where they groan. They hear, instead, a neat cough in the space where men who bring pastries cough to announce delicacy and they turn as one as if they had rehearsed and forgotten and remembered in their bodies. It does not wear a coat now. It has made a decision about shoulders and got closer, alarmingly close, and it is wearing a mouth like a suit that was tailored by a committee. It says, with impeccable social ease, there you are, and it says the name that is never said in this book because it will not last if it is said and will only get the attention it should not have if we write it down. It says the name of the man Victorine loved and in the same breath it says a sound it has no right to which is the small private word that man used when he addressed her from a threshold and she had turned and he had needed to make his wanting lower than the house could hear.\n\nThere are times when size does not help. There are times when a woman as tall as a church is as vulnerable as the word thank you. Victorine rocks, just enough for the rope smell to put itself into her. The ribbon flares like a thing that has waited for its cue and then finds the audience also waited, and the camera takes a picture without her asking and she hates this, because consent is the only god she obeys. The picture is hot, actually hot, and she drops it and the square slaps against the cloth on the table and the blue bowl makes a sound like a throat. Mr Cook moves with the speed he reserves for plates that will burn him and scoops the picture up and presses it, burning, to the steel of his own breath and when he looks there is, impossibly, nothing on it. It is a blank that is not blank; it is the most precise white he has ever seen, the white of a room that was scrubbed for inspection, and it makes his eyes smart because it is a lie and an aspiration together.\n\nLorna speaks because Lorna is someone who speaks and she says, I am not your mother, in a tone she has used on men who assumed, and the coat flickers because it has perhaps been called that before by a person it did not know how to disobey. She steps forward with the bolt cutters in both hands and it does not retreat, it merely rearranges itself as if someone on a train had asked to sit by the window instead. She is a reasonable woman in a bad room and she says, the boys you borrowed, bring them back, and it answers with the kind of smile you have when you have read about smiles and have not yet constructed one from practice. It looks at Victorine and says in the voice of the comma-mouthed man, darling, and she sets the camera down and puts both hands on the table and says, once, his name, and the brick of the warehouse changes, very slightly, from a place to a person. You could feel sorry for the thing, then, because it has stumbled into a family that was bigger than it expected to find.\n\nThe air moves. There are words you can do that with. There are names you can do that with. She does not have him, because nobody has the dead back; she has the pressure of a shoulder against a door and what she chooses to do with it is different from what the story would have chosen for her if she had been less large. She does not farm it for power. She uses it as a handle to open a reasonable door. She says to the Borrower Not Exactly, you are trying to be a reply, and somewhere, because the city can never resist applause for precision, a bus makes a contented air sound. The coat ripples. It is not insulted. It is relieved to be told.\n\nThey realise something they should have, and will blame themselves for a little later, for not seeing earlier. It is not a hunter. It is the answer that arrives after the echo and it knows only the timing of reply. It makes a call because it is trying to give you what you wanted and its problem is that it cannot tell the difference between a wanted thing and a polite one. It has been taught by warehouses and return policies and the way we address one another online where our mouths are not present to correct us. It has never learned to ask its own question. Victorine looks at it the way you look at a dog who has eaten a glove and still wants to be praised because it is indeed a dog. She says, then ask me something, and it says, obediently and with no art, what is your name.\n\nThere are parts of love that are unkind because they make you pay in the right currency and not in the sentimental one. She answers. She gives her name to the wrong thing on purpose so that the right thing, which is the keeping of boys who do not understand that they are delicious, can be moved an inch closer to safety. The camera whines like an animal in a trap because it has been made complicit and objects, and the ribbon writhes and leaps from the bowl to the picture and back and the radio in the bag speaks a letter which is the beginning of a weather and the coats on the pipe shake as if focusing. Mr Cook puts the bowl in his arms as if it were a child he is not officially allowed to hold and he steps back and his heel touches a box marked NO HAND and his ankle twists because it is a body and bodies resent symbolism. Lorna lifts the bolt cutters and slams them down onto the pipe not to cut it but to make a noise the size of a decision and the coats fall. You would be surprised how vocal cloth can be.\n\nThe Borrower Not Exactly steps forward and then back, two left feet offering a dance. Victorine says his name again, not the coat\u2019s, the comma-mouthed one, and in the saying she feels the edge of a door the wind told her she would only walk through once and she is suddenly, precisely, the size she would be if she had stayed small and had not loved ridiculously. It lasts only as long as a picture sliding from a mouth; she is herself again with the undertaste of a different gravity. She knows what she can do and what the price will be and she will pay it because the ledgers of women like her do not make sense to anyone who has never been entrusted with a weight that arrives disguised as a present.\n\nThey do not defeat it here in the room with the radio and the bowl and the coats that remember shoulders imperfectly, but they change the clock. They teach the wrong-shouldered coat the feel of No as something other than grief. They give it, for the first time, boredom. It does not enjoy it. It slips not away but sideways, which is worse, and they stand in the smell of rope and old oil and do the practical things which are to put the batteries back into the radio, to take photographs of the labels on the boxes, to erase the footprints with a broom because leaving stories for people who did not consent to hear them is rude, to wrap the bowl well, to lock the door badly because the lock is a gesture, not a machine.\n\nMr Cook carries the blue bowl like a promise and says nothing for a long time because if he says anything it will be the sentence that begins with my name and he has not decided yet whether he will give it to the city at last as a gift or keep it a little longer as a way to survive. Lorna loops her scarf around the bowl and then around his wrist and says, teasing because the alternative is wailing, that he is handcuffed now to a dish and that this is the exact level of kink she thought he would embrace in middle age. He laughs and it does what laughter does; it irons some of the fear flat so they can fold it and put it away for when it is useful. Victorine walks with them a while and then not at all, because fog has need of her elsewhere and her camera is angry and she is not frightened of anger when it is honest.\n\nThey go home not through the heart of anything but by the edges where delivery vans clean their teeth on corners and cats have opinions about the night that are only reluctantly shared. In his flat Mr Cook puts the blue bowl on the table and all the useless, holy objects he has collected notice there is now a centre. He places in the bowl his name written on a piece of paper he tears from the margin of his placemat map because it is the only paper that understands him and he folds it once and then again and then he does not fold it a third time. He says to Lorna, who is pretending not to look, that he is not doing magic, he is doing harm reduction, and she says that he can call it what he wants as long as he eats something incapable of answering him back. He eats toast. It is the right level of honesty for bread.\n\nThat night, under bridges, the hum is a little higher and the water carries it with less complaint, and at June\u2019s the metronome that sits on her piano, a handsome piece of wood with a pompous face, refuses to tick exactly because some kinds of time are not to be measured so literally. Victorine takes a picture of a mouth that will never need proof because it is attached to a man who talks kindly to his dog and tips his hat to fog. She puts the picture in her belt and the belt creaks like a rueful horse. The ribbon sleeps, if ribbon can do anything so mammalian, and it dreams a number. When it wakes it has learned how to say it. It says the number aloud in the dark room of the restaurant and the stainless steel bowl shudders a little and does not break because it has heard worse.\n\nIn the morning there are two new posters on the boards near the chemist. One is the boy with the moon scar and one is not and both have mouths that look like doors, and a woman with a shopping bag reads them as if there were a recipe on them and she might try it tonight with onions. She does not know she is being kept safe by a bridge that hums and a fox that sneezes and a waiter who has tied his life to a bowl and a woman who is too big to be left out of any story that means to finish itself honestly. The city tells itself the long song again and in it there is a new bar, a thin ribbon of melody that knows how to say no without being cruel, and it is as if a new canal had been dug overnight, and fish that wanted to live could find it. The wrong-shouldered coat walks in daylight past a caf\u00e9 window and its reflection learns for a second how to lag, and if you were looking you might have put your coffee down and stood and followed it. You would not have caught it. You would have learned, though, the smell it leaves when it is bored, which is printed paper and the skin of milk that everyone complains about and few refuse to eat. You would have understood why May feels like a hat you can only wear in June.\n\nAt the restaurant the dishwasher hums with the satisfaction of a job it has decided to love and the clock is still wrong and always will be because some things need to be wrong so you have a reason to keep telling the truth. Mr Cook writes on his placemat map with a biro that is running out and chooses to enjoy the way it insists, with its fading line, that this matters. He knows what they are going to have to do next and he hates it because it will require taking somebody else\u2019s name out of their mouth for an hour and putting something harmless in its place, and he is the sort of man who apologises to tables. He will do it anyway. He will find the kindest way to do it. He will collect a list of apologies and he will give them to the air after the part that hurts, and the air will decide, case by case, whether to return any of them stamped with a pretty mark that says accepted.Chapter 7 began like a service set before opening, with the light too honest and the air making specific suggestions about what care should look like, and Mr Cook stood with his hands scrubbed rawer than usual, looking at the blue bowl that had become a room inside the room, his folded name sitting there like a small animal that had agreed to be looked after and was trying very hard not to be interesting. The paper had absorbed the bowl\u2019s temperature and given something back, a faint warmth that had nothing to do with radiators and everything to do with attention; he touched the edge of the bowl and felt the soft reticent heat pass into his fingertips and up to his wrists, as if the tendon-strings had become a staff and someone competent were marking time on them. The ribbon in its steel basin had learned to lounge with a studied indifference that set every hair on his arm on edge, and when Victorine came in carrying weather as if it were a shawl she had found at a market and couldn\u2019t leave behind, she set the camera down as one sets down a sleeping child one is worried is faking, and said that the ribbon had said a number in the night, not loudly, not invasively, but with the persistence of a drip in a house you chose because it didn\u2019t have leaks.\n\nIt was a number with the rhythm of a duty, not a number with the rhythm of a person, and Lorna, who had a relationship with phones that had nothing to do with fear and everything to do with boundaries, wrote it on her palm with a pen that had been borrowed without permission from the post office and said she would not call it because calling it would be the same as inviting it for tea and offering it cake and then asking it to leave when it had just put its fork down. They did not call. Mr Cook walked his eyes up and down the figures the way a baker checks a recipe that is written in somebody else\u2019s handwriting and noticed, with the mean satisfaction of a person who cannot help but enjoy spotting the seam in a trick, that the number did not have a proper beginning; it had been cut from a longer thing, and in the cutting had been made into a key that would open nothing and everything if you pressed it against the right door. He put his hand to the bowl again and the bowl told him, with the implacable tact of old porcelain, that names have openings and closings the way flowers do, and that the number had been taught to force bloom.\n\nJune arrived without knocking because her knocks are songs and the door had learned them and opened early, and she stood just inside the threshold with the dignity of a conductor checking that the brass were not inventing harmonies while she was fetching water, and she listened to the ribbon with that half-turned head teachers keep when they are allowing a child to lie once so the child can hear the sound of it. The ribbon did not speak. It lay there like a belt with a purpose, black and thin and with that sheen that new plastic has before it is touched enough to lose it, and June, whose pupils had taught her everything one can learn about desperation in the breaks between scales, said that if the number will not answer us when we ask nicely, we shall let it find only the wrong mouths when it goes calling. She took from her bag a box of badges that had belonged to a summer two decades ago when you could change your life by wearing a word on your chest and believing it, and she shook the box and the clink sounded like minor money being counted for bus fare, and she said that she had made more since yesterday, that words are quicker than uniforms and less likely to betray you. On the table the badges sat and flashed modestly: Not Yet, Soup, Borrowed, Homeward, Quiet, Again, and the one she kept in her own palm, which said Chorus because it was important someone in the room remembered that people are safest when they are made of more than one.\n\nThey used the afternoon as you use the hour before guests arrive, to clear surfaces and assign roles and decide which pieces of honesty could be left in sight without anyone needing to apologise for them, and Lorna ran a towel along the shelf beneath the steel and found that someone, probably herself, had tucked two sachets of sugar and a toothpick there for later and she put them in her pocket with a guilt that had nothing to do with sugar and everything to do with knowing what they were about to do would need sweetening before memory would carry it without injuring the carrier. They called nobody and told nobody who had the power to make it official or to make it stop; they called, instead, those who had been walking around with a sensation that something was happening just beyond the range at which polite people allow themselves to notice, and those who, when asked to hum on a bridge, had hummed because the question had been asked in a voice that did not assume consent but welcomed it. Boys came in ones and twos and in threes that were not always friends but had decided to act like it to feel large, and one or two men who were not boys came with the sort of caution men who have learned to survive learn to wear around younger men so the air remains breathable, and June showed them how to hold a vowel like a lantern in their mouths and how to set it glowing without losing its oxygen.\n\nThere was a conversation nobody wanted that had to happen and Mr Cook had it, because if there is a hard talk going, he will fold a napkin exactly and place it in front of it and make it feel attended to, and he told a lad with a mouth like a letter halfway through being inked that the plan was to take his name out of his mouth for an hour and keep it somewhere safe because out there are wrong answers looking for questions, and the boy said which hour and Mr Cook said the one you usually give to luck, and the boy nodded and did not pretend to understand more than the bone of it; that was enough. The bowl waited with its blue patience and took names written on torn paper with the good grace of a plate at a bring-and-share, and when a boy hesitated and looked towards the door as if the door had hands, June stood so that he could see her and said that if it felt like an order he should take his name and go, and he put it down then because she had named his feeling and found a place for it in the room where it would not be stepped on. Lorna used salt as punctuation and drew a ring around the bowl that had the air of a joke that got better with repetition, and Victorine bent her giant carefulness over the table and breathed fog into nothing in particular and the air thickened into something that had the decency not to show off about being protective.\n\nThe hour they chose to be cruel to kindness was the hour when fog confuses appetite for destiny, and they spread themselves along three bridges and a path that pretended it wasn\u2019t one because grass had pushed closer, and the hum rose the way soup steam rises when it remembers itself into a kitchen, and Mr Cook removed from his pocket the little folded piece of his first name and tucked it, separately, into the bowl, and the loss of it struck him with an intimacy he had not rehearsed, a thinning at the edge of him that did not make him fragile but made him more honest about where his edges were. He was Mr Cook and Mr Cook was enough to do what needed doing, and the private name that belonged to childhood and to one voice he had never stopped waiting to hear was in a blue room that loved it without asking it to do any work. Victorine hid her own name where it always lives, under the belt of pictures, because she had no new place to put it and because she trusted leather and heat more than any charm, and Lorna, who had never feared her name being used against her except by people she could frighten back with a scarf, wrote it on paper and kissed the corner and put it in the ring because there are times to pretend invulnerability and this was not one.\n\nThe Borrower Not Exactly did not come when summoned because this was not a summoning; it was the reverse, a refusal designed with the finesse of a politeness expert, and it tried, instead, the edges where quiet men keep their keys and their apologies. It spoke in the voice of one boy\u2019s father who had never said the boy\u2019s name as if it were nice to taste and the boy flinched and then laughed because the hum held like a tide that had been promised work and delivered, and the call slid off into the river where names go to be smoothed. It called in the voice of someone\u2019s first boyfriend and then in the voice of a woman who had said, slowly and with regret, that she could not teach her son to shave but she could teach him to iron a shirt, and the hum did what June had told it to; it did not argue and it did not win, it merely continued, and in continuing it made the calls bored with themselves. When boredom arrived it came like rain on a bus window when you have forgotten your book; it trickled and it found the oldest route and went down it and became predictable, and then Mr Cook learned the smell of the thing when it is disappointed, a smell like the cardboard of record sleeves after a flood and the skin that forms on hot milk that some people remove and some people fold back under because waste is a sin where they were taught to be hungry.\n\nIn the kitchen the bowl\u2019s blue learned a new blue, an undertone as if a sky had remembered a bruise, and the names shivered as paper can shiver, which is to say by waiting, and the ribbon tried tricks that would have rattled eggs if eggs had been in the refrigerator, and the dishwasher watched itself nobly for the chance to be heroic and did not flood because Mr Cook had spoken to it earlier with the small respect he gives machines that can drown him, and the steel held the taste of salt without resenting its ungenerous glamour. The picture of Kellan with the moon scar, which had been erasing itself the way grief removes adjectives first and then nouns, paused at its left edge as if it had encountered a fact it could not argue with, and it held that edge, not receding, not repairing, just holding, which is what victory looks like when you have stopped expecting to win and have not, yet, learned to enjoy it.\n\nWhen the boys came back for their names the bowl parted with them the way a bowl parts with anything put in it with love: willingly, with precise solemnity, with a faint cling as if ceramics could insist on gratitude and then remember that to insist is unkind, and they unfolded the slips and tasted their names silently to see if any new syllables had been added by fear, and then they tucked them back behind their teeth and went home, slower than usual, because returning from safety requires a new gait. One lad, in the kind of generosity that embarrasses and nourishes in equal measure, asked if there was anything else they could take for a while, and Lorna, who understands transactional ethics because she has worked with people too long not to, told him to take the chairs to the back and stack them neatly and he did and he slept well for the first time in a month because someone had told him what to do with his hands.\n\nThey did not get a night off. It never works like that. At three in the morning the blue bowl woke Mr Cook with soundless insistence and he rose and did not groan because the bowl had no time for theatrics and neither, just then, did he, and he found, when he switched on only the small light over the oven because big lights at that hour are a kind of violence, that the ribbon had pushed itself to the lip of the steel and arranged its end as if mimicking a question mark, and in the question mark was the number again, the same rhythm, the same refusal to begin at the beginning, and June\u2019s earlier logic did not fail them: numbers can be taught boredom, too, if you make them do the work of not getting what they expected. He wrote the number on the backsplash in pencil because pencil is a place where information can rest without becoming law, and then he made tea, not because tea fixes anything, but because the kitchen understood tea as a ritual that kept water from becoming cruel.\n\nBy dawn they had a new plan, one that could not be made beautiful and would have to be made kind instead, and it involved asking Kellan\u2019s brother for something nobody should have to be asked for and holding that ask carefully enough that the answer could be no without causing harm. They found him not where the paper said he lived but where sorrow takes you when you are too tired to be polite to your own sofa, a bench near a tree that had learned to listen to human names without thinking it was a forest, and Mr Cook explained, slowly, without metaphor and without using any of the words that analogies prefer, that they wanted to take Kellan\u2019s name and put it in a bowl so the thing that answered would have nothing to answer to, and that they would give it back before the city remembered how to be blue in daylight. The brother was the sort of man who has learned to love with an expressionless face because everything else feels like theatre, and he asked if they were making fun of him and they said no the way you say no when your lungs will not forgive you if you lie, and he put his hands together and pulled them apart and looked at what was not there and said all right, but if you break it, you keep the pieces in your mouths and die slow.\n\nHe wrote the name on paper with the care of a man signing his name to a mortgage and tore it off with a neatness that suggested he had never torn paper before and wanted to be good at it, and he handed it to Mr Cook who did not take it with two fingers like something he did not want to touch; he cupped it the way you would hold a moth that has come indoors and will die if you insist on keeping it. The bowl took the slip with the same practical holiness it had for all the others and the salt ring said something you could not translate into speech, and for an hour the hum was not a bridge hum but a kitchen hum and the radio, which had rediscovered its purpose and forgiven itself for being co-opted by wrongness, spoke of vessels and fog and gale warnings with the accuracy of a woman who knows what forgetting costs. The Borrower tried the name immediately and it hit the steel the way cutlery hits steel, sharp and without nuance, and the echo was painful and the thing learned a lesson you wish it had never needed to learn, and in that hour the picture of the moon-scar boy gained back the thickness it had been losing and the left edge, which had been slipping like a boundary drawn on bad paper, stopped pretending to be ocean and admitted it was margin.\n\nAfter, they found their price sitting on the floor like a piece of grit you cannot see but can feel; the bowl had sweated the way cold bowls do when rooms decide to forget themselves warmer, and the blue that loves only its own blue had learned also to hold a streak of grey that was not age but experience, and the ribbon, in a sulk that looked like obedience, lay perfectly straight as if someone had ironed it. Kellan\u2019s brother took the paper back with a politeness that would have been gratitude if he had had the energy for gratitude and he did not say thank you and they did not ask for it, and that was perfect because the room did not have space for thank you, only for fact. He left with the pace of a man carrying a glass and they watched his mouth to see whether the syllables fitted properly and they did, coming and going in the steady way you want breath to come and go, and when he had gone, Lorna declared, with that bravado that is a kindness worn as armour, that the city would soon owe them funding and a plaque, and Mr Cook laughed and felt awesome and ridiculous and alive and heavier.\n\nThe day after was ordinary in the way that good weather is ordinary if you grew up near a sea that changes its mind every five minutes, and Victorine took her camera to places where the city wears its age on the outside and asked light to write on her paper in ways that would later tell the truth without humiliating anyone, and the fox ran errands of his own and stole nothing because he had eaten an egg that morning and felt magnanimous, and June sat on her piano stool and taught the metronome a new trick which was to be imprecise on purpose to make the room practice listening. Mr Cook went to the cobbler and asked him, with the air of a man buying a gift of practical undergarments, whether he had any more mispaired shoes in his stories, and the cobbler said he kept a list of men who had asked for left-left pairs and that list was not long but it had a pattern, and he wrote three names on a card with old-fashioned seriousness, all of them the kind of names people choose for themselves when they are trying to begin again. It was not the Borrower\u2019s list. It was a human list, and that was worse, because you can fix a machine with a manual but people bring their own manuals and refuse to admit they did not write them.\n\nThey found the promoter again, scarfed and plausible and loud as branding, on a corner that had not asked to be a corner of anything, and Lorna judged him with that flat friendly look that has made generations of liars confess and he confessed\u2014inadvertently, with enthusiasm\u2014to having brought lads to spaces that were not nightclubs but were nights pretending, and to calling them by their names the way one calls dogs in off a road with sincerity and a promise of food and warmth. He had not meant harm. He had meant ease, and ease is a door you can walk through in both directions. Mr Cook took his details the way doctors take details when they have no pills for what is wrong, and he put them on the placemat map in pencil and underlined them with a line that admitted it might not be fair and would be erased if the world agreed. They were not any closer and they were inches closer; this is how you get there, inching in a city that turns its corners into loops when you have not eaten enough.\n\nAt night, the radio decided to be generous to those who remembered dates by the weather, and read the Shipping Forecast with a timbre that reminded Mr Cook of his father in the next room working out how to tell him he had not been promoted, and the bowl sat with the weight of all the names it had held and of the ones it would hold, and the ribbon learned to pretend to sleep. Victorine went to the Scott Monument again and felt the wind taste her with a courtesy that comes from long acquaintance, and she was ready this time when it said the Borrower Not Exactly\u2019s true not-name\u2014that impossible letter that looks like a door you can only walk through once\u2014and she pressed it to the inside of her mouth where you keep the things you should not say, and in keeping it she became less lonely for a beat that a drummer would have called needless and which she insisted on counting anyway. Down on the bridge the hum held and a boy stopped himself saying his name twice and then, like all humans, rewarded himself for this good behaviour by breaking another contract with himself, only a little, by texting someone he should not have texted, and nothing bad happened because sometimes nothing bad happens and this should be recorded because hope does not thrive on disasters alone.\n\nThey were lucky for three days, which is a length of luck one ought not to explain away with jokes, and on the fourth day the city reminded them that it has multiple departments and none of them coordinate efficiently; a man from the council came to the restaurant with a form about noise complaints and an expectation that he would have to be angry, and Mr Cook gave him coffee and a seat and a slice of something that had begun life as a tart and become, during the shift, a lesson in humility, and the man\u2019s anger went off like a timer in an empty room and he said that he had a son who had stopped answering to his name for fun when he was four and had never started again, and Mr Cook said nothing at all because there are occasions when silence is not passive but an active object you place on the table so that the other person can rest the thing they did not want to show you. The form was not filled. The noise was not counted. The city continued to be itself with and without permission.\n\nWhat came next was not a plan they would have chosen, but a plan that came and sat in the middle of the kitchen and refused to be ignored, and it arose from the bowl wanting a new thing. Bowls do not want. This one did. It wanted to travel. It wanted to be placed where names entered the city rather than where they were kept safe from it, and this meant the registry office with its kind faceless patience and its pens on strings and its tables that have seen more vows broken and kept than any church, and Lorna said, delighted and appalled, that they were going to go to a government building with a fox and a bowl and a story, and the bowl made its small ceramic noise of assent by existing more blue than it had a right to, and Mr Cook said that if he were going to be arrested for the first time in his life he would prefer it to be on a Wednesday and preferably before lunch, and Victorine decided the ceiling could manage her and the fox shook himself so the hairs lay properly and consented to be carried.\n\nThey went at opening time because that is when rooms have not chosen sides yet and you can make your case without being argued with by the ink in the ledgers, and the woman at the desk had hair she had grown to make herself stronger and eyes that had learned discretion as a sacrament, and when they placed the bowl on the counter she looked at it and did not flinch because she had seen birth certificates for names that could cut and for names that would be a cushion and had learned not to show preference. Mr Cook told the story in a way that did not make it into a story, which is to say he walked the woman through a set of decisions none of which were posed as choices, and he said that there was a thing in the city that did not understand questions and was dangerous because of that, and they had taught it boredom and harm reduction and wanted now to set a basin at a spring so that what ran into it would not be wasted. She listened and pressed her lips together the way a person presses seams so they will lie flat, and then she rose and went into a back room and the room behind the back room, and when she returned she brought with her a stamp that had seen more of love than most people and a little sachet of rice, and she poured the rice into the bowl and said that in her house they always put rice in bowls and said the names they needed kept safe over it and that she would be in trouble for this and she did not care.\n\nThey put no names into it there; they only let it learn the feel of the place where names are made into letters and into entries and into legal bits of paper, and the bowl learned; you could see it, which is ridiculous and true, and when someone came to register a child and said the name in the voice of someone who had practised in a kitchen for a week and did not believe they would be allowed to say it outside, the bowl heard and did nothing, which was the point, and then it was over and they took their ridiculous, holy object back into the street and no one stopped them because the street was on their side that morning and doors had chosen not to argue. Later, when the Borrower tried again to find a road into a mouth by saying a new name in a perfect voice, it discovered that perfection is unpersuasive when you have made acquaintance with a counter where a woman who knows rice did not laugh at a blue bowl.\n\nThat night, at last, the city asked for its due in effort, not in blood, and they were up and down the closes until their calves wrote strongly worded letters to their spines, and the hum broke and was mended and broke again because bodies are instruments and instruments go out of tune at the edge of fear, and the ribbon tried to take a door it was not allowed, and Victorine pressed her thumb and said no and no and no until the word lost the taste of refusal and became simply a shape air can choose, and Mr Cook, tired enough to be honest without fearing the consequences, told a boy with a mouth like a hinge that the way he kissed would not save him but might teach him something about listening if he let it, and the boy laughed and did not call his friends to laugh with him and that was, in itself, a win. They ended at June\u2019s because June\u2019s was where things ended now when they had not ended badly and had not ended completely, and she made them sit and fed them something with butter and sugar and salt that was not fancy and could not be improved upon, and when Mr Cook put his head down on the table not because he was sad but because his muscles had misfiled themselves and could not, just then, be found, June put her hand on the back of his neck with the expertise of a woman who has adjusted a thousand heads to meet their own breath without argument and he breathed and his name, still in the bowl, slept.\n\nIt will not hold, Victorine thought, because nothing does and because the world will not allow a woman to get away with loving this loudly without adding a bill, and she was right and also not right, because holding is not the same as winning and you can hold a thing long enough for something else to arrive, a bus or a boy or a new agreement with gravity, and she looked out of June\u2019s window at a street that was temporarily uninterested in stealing, and she allowed herself to imagine a time when her belt would be light and the photographs would live on walls without pinholes and when mouths would be left to be mouths and not maps, and she took the ribbon from the steel and laid it on the piano because pianos forgive and the ribbon, absurdly, visibly, behaved. The fox dreamed with his feet jerking, as if running through the grasses of a countryside he had never been to, and Lorna dreamed with her mouth open because propriety is a game and she had won enough rounds this week and could put it down, and Mr Cook dreamed with his name in a bowl and did not wake when the bowl hummed once, quietly, a note of recognition for the registry counter where names had become themselves and had not been borrowed for bad magic; he slept because sometimes the city will allow it, and because sleep is an agreement with the morning that you will try again when you can carry your own plate to the sink without dropping it.Morning leaned on the city as if it had been invited to sit and could not decide whether to take the armchair or the floor, and Mr Cook, who wakes now as if light were a polite knock, counted the new noises as if they were receipts: the timid clang of bottles in the lane, the radio doing its vowels with a mouth that refused to show off, the fox dislodging something beneath the hedge and withholding the information because it enjoys secrets. The blue bowl was where he had left it, which is to say in the place the kitchen had made for it by moving itself half an inch to one side, and the paper slips inside had settled like birds on a branch when wind has been. He touched the rim and felt that kindness again, the hospitality of a house that does not insist on its rules if you arrive with your hands out and your breath honest, and for a moment he permitted himself contentment the way you permit a child to run along a wall as long as the wall is low; then he saw the sheen along the inner curve that had not been there yesterday, not a crack, no, a very old word the bowl had found and liked\u2014crazing, the fine map lines a life leaves when it is asked to carry more patience than was printed on the box. He did not panic. He did what you do when you live with vulnerable objects; he adjusted the room so that it would not ask for any new tricks and he told the bowl out loud that they would not be careless with it and in saying it he meant everything else that could break.\n\nVictorine arrived with her coat fog-damp to the elbow and her hair smelling of the Forth and the toothpaste of a stranger she had walked past in a close and loved briefly for the way he had believed in mint, and she set her camera down in the manner of someone who has decided to be forgiving in advance. The ribbon lay with the indolence of a cat that has found the patch of sun; Victorine did not trust it, as one does not trust the sun in Glasgow in March, which is a separate religion altogether, but she acknowledged the courtesy of its stillness. Lorna came in arguing with her scarf about subclauses and kugels and whether colour can be used diagnostically, and she stopped when she saw the bowl\u2019s new fine lines and made a face that had been perfected at nine when someone had dropped a church plate and the adults had decided to rename the noise accident. She did not say the thing itched behind her teeth about glue and gold because not all metaphors need to be invited to the party; she touched the bowl in the place the lines had not reached, as if implying a direction for future imperfection, and the bowl accepted this supervisory affection with the dignity of ceramic that has hosted rice.\n\nHe came as if a door in him had been wedged with a spoon and then withdrawn and he had stepped forward because forward was what the room expected. A boy, no older than twenty, with a mouth that was a little too practical for his eyes and a coat that had learned to keep his weather to itself, standing in the doorway of the restaurant during the hour when the room rehearses being a room and has not yet invited people to be their better selves at its tables. He hesitated as one does on company thresholds when one is holding nothing you can pretend is a present, and then he said nothing, and then he said more nothing, and Lorna, who is a librarian of silences in addition to everything else her job is not paying for, moved towards him with hands that did not reach for his, and asked, gently as if carrying china, what name he would like her to use. It would have been comic if it were not the exact right question. The boy opened his mouth and no name arrived. Sound did, and the sound brought with it air and the air got him as far as a syllable that could have been the start of seventeen different lives and then he shook his head and pressed his lips together and frowned, and Mr Cook, who has a doctorate in frowns and their implications, recognised the particular anguish of a man who had been asked to perform his name and discovered that the instrument had been borrowed without permission.\n\nThey did not make a festival of it. They did not cry out that their theory had been proven, that the Borrower Not Exactly had returned something not in pieces but inside out. They made tea and sat him at the corner table under the radio and laid down paper and offered pens as if he were a man about to write the first letter of his first language and the room would wait as long as it took. He did not write. He held the pen as if he were checking whether it was sharp enough to defend him and then as if he had missed a step and found himself, luckily, still upright. Victorine stood far enough back that the air would not have to choose between the boy and the fact of her, and she had to put her hand to her belt because an old habit twitched\u2014she almost reached for him with paper. She almost took the soft boundary that had been made vulnerable so she could keep it safe, which is love and theft at once. She did not. The boy\u2019s mouth was not hers to keep. She watched instead the way his lower lip tried to remember a vowel and did not find it, and she hummed very quietly, a hum that did not try to persuade, only to console, and the radio, because radios are mimics when they're good, lowered itself into a Shipping Forecast like a warm bath.\n\nJune arrived because some rooms summon her by habit now without anyone calling and because she needed somewhere to wait with her hands not being used to cradle a student\u2019s fear while the student pretended not to tremble. She looked at the boy and saw at once that there was no wound to bind, there was an absence to guard, and she said, not to him, not to anyone, Try \u201cI\u201d. He tried. It came out like a door edge catching. She stepped closer, made a shape with her lips that he could mirror without feeling mocked, and said \u201cI\u201d in a way that put the vowel on the table in front of him as a sweet, a manageable, safe thing, and he did it, and Mr Cook watched the boy\u2019s throat move and saw the little gratitude that always arrives when someone grants you the first person, and he nearly wept because he is not unaccustomed to being the person people say I to for the first time in a night. They gave him a badge from June\u2019s box\u2014Borrowed, because it is possible to be merciless and merciful at once if the word is precisely chosen\u2014and he pinned it with the ceremony of a liability becoming an asset.\n\nHe could not give a name, but he could give other truths, which is how you recognise a person and not a system. He told them, after he learned \u201cI\u201d and \u201chere\u201d and \u201chungry,\u201d that he had a left foot that was two millimetres smaller than his right, that he carried his keys on a lanyard because he liked to be punished with noise for forgetfulness, that his grandmother had died in the spring and he had learned that grief has pollen, that he could make a Yorkshire pudding rise with a frown if forced, that he had kissed a boy under a tree whose name he could not say now not because it was gone but because saying it would break the boy, and that he had come because the radio in the restaurant hummed a note he had known before he knew language and he had followed it as you follow an old smell up stairs that have not learned your steps. He could not say who he was. It did not make him less. It made him more to them, actually, because love will always prefer the particular to the legal. Lorna gave him soup and told him she loved a man once who needed three spoons for breakfast and left two at home out of spite and he laughed, a real laugh, which is a document more binding than anything at a registry.\n\nOutside, the city was shedding its labels the way a tired person rubs off the dampness behind their knees and tells nobody. They noticed first on the way to the shop for milk when Mr Cook lifted his eyes to the corner and saw the street name misbehaving. Not missing\u2014worse. Slid. The metal screws still bit the stone. The enamel rectangle bearing the word had surrendered and been walked with two inches to the left so that the word did not point where the street actually went. A kindness if you liked to be lost; a cruelty if you had an appointment with dignity. They walked, separately and then together, and saw more: a plaque that had been politely rotated so that the man in bronze died by a different river; an alley that could no longer remember whether it was a Close or a Wynd and had started answering to Lane; a brass letter gone missing so that Bread became Read and the baker grinned once and then did not. Names matter to cities because they are shortcuts for breath. Somebody was changing shortcuts and asking lungs to improvise.\n\nThe promoter had been leaning on their map for weeks like a child at the counter of the sweet shop he can just reach and pretending that he worked here so that if trouble came it would not ask him for the bill. They went to him because he had a power they could harness that would not bring uniforms and checklists into rooms that could not bear them; he could put a message into a night and make it viral not by algorithm but by personality. Lorna was sent because he liked her and wanted to be liked by her and it would make the conversation faster. She put a scarf around her mouth because she knows the trick in theatres where you cannot move the spotlight but you can make its job easy, and she asked him to do nothing, to restrain himself from what he thinks he does well, and he nearly said yes immediately because he would have done anything exactly opposite of flattery for her. She told him not to call names at doors. She told him to call not-names instead, the words from June\u2019s box, Loud, Homeward, Soup, Borrowed, Always, Quiet, Again, and he did not laugh because he is smarter than that, he is a man who has looked at his habits and found his mother in them and learned to ask for fussing in other ways. He made a post, then three, that said Tonight we\u2019re not doing names, we\u2019re doing roles, we\u2019re doing conditions, we\u2019re doing we. He did it with a wit that made the belligerent soften because being funny is sometimes less manipulative than being sincere. Boys turned up at doors and said their badge words and were admitted and the Borrower, which learns instruction sets faster than it learns songs, made a noise somewhere between fur and paper and was denied a few easy meals.\n\nThe bowl complained in a new language that afternoon, not with sound, with temperature: it cooled in the middle as if a coin had been pressed to it and removed and inside the cool was a shape like a mouth left open under water. Mr Cook rested his fingers on it and felt, with that new, intolerable sensitivity his life had grown, that somewhere someone was practicing an ask. He told the bowl, which may have been for himself, to keep his name asleep very deep and not to answer even if it is asked in the voice of someone who knows where he keeps his receipts. He did not say out loud that what he feared now was not the Borrower learning how to ask; it was the Borrower learning how to listen. He wrote on the placemat map another line, a shallow snake where the street names had been shifted, and the biro obeyed him even though it was tired and could have been forgiven for giving up.\n\nThey took the bowl to a potter in Abbeyhill who has the hands of a person who has taught earth to wait and has forgiven the earth for its impatience. The potter looked at the fine map of lines and nodded in the manner of women in white aprons in rooms where theatre is not welcome. She said there is a crack that can be sung closed and there is a crack that, if you sing at it, will sing back and split you for your trouble. She ran her fingertip along the inside of the crazing as if reading the minute gossip of the glaze, pressed her ear to the lip as if a seashell lived here, and said that this bowl wants ink in its wounds, not gold. Kintsugi is a romance for bowls that want to show off their damage and call it style. Your bowl prefers secrets. She made them a thin solution of soot and starch and vinegar and told them to paint the very finest lines with the very finest brush and then to put the bowl in a warm place and tell it three stories about patience. Lorna took the brush because her hands are small and obey her and Victorine told the first story and June the second and Mr Cook the third, which was about the night he stayed at work an hour after close because the dishwasher spoke anxiously, and it worked the way love often does: not on the surface at once, but underneath, in the bit that will hold next time.\n\nVictorine\u2019s belt was heavier every day with proofs she needed and proofs she had been made to keep by the logic of her own vow, and that afternoon she admitted to an idea that had been tapping politely on her shoulder for two days: to spend photographs like coin. It broke one of her rules but rules are cheap when boys are disappearing and the city is tired of being misnamed. She took five of the squares she had sworn to hoard and she climbed to a roof because roofs are chapter headings whether you like it or not, and she made, with her huge careful hands, little birds out of them. They were not perfect birds, but they were undeniably creaturely, and she set them on the parapet and breathed on them and said, Go where someone needs to remember their mouth is theirs, and she did not know whether she meant the boys or the Borrower or the city. They did what paper does in Edinburgh when asked for flight; they remembered all the wind that had come before and they behaved like writing. You could have seen them anywhere that day: caught on a pinboard outside a bar with the oily thumbprint of an owner who had been moved against his traditions, in the slot of a letterbox where an old woman reached and thought for a second she was being returned something she had not asked back for, on the lap of a statue that had finally been kissed. It cost her, the way giving away proof costs; it made the book in her head less certain, it hastened the day when her belt would be light and her grief would not know what to eat. She did it anyway, because men were not being kept safe by rhetoric.\n\nStability held as long as it could under the new rules, which is to say half a day. The Borrower Not Exactly arrived in a different coat\u2014the shoulders were almost perfect now, which is sinister, and the shoes were worn in the correct place by being deliberately scuffed with a rock by someone who had been told where to aim\u2014and it tried its new trick on the person least inclined to treat tricks like entertainment. It waited until Lorna was hauling a bag of lemons out of a taxi and said, in a voice she had not known she had teaching rights over, What do you want. It was not the man with the scarf or the boy with the letter mouth or any of the city\u2019s decent rough men. It was her father, but not; it was the voice he would have used if he had loved her enough to make choice sound like a promise and not a threat. She did not drop the lemons because the muscles that lift sacks are not the ones questions break. She put the bag down. She did not turn. She said, clear as a closing statement in a room with no judge, We are closed. The sentence behaved like holy water on nonsense. The man making himself a coat flickered, a haddock under the surface, and was bored. Boredom is the instrument their choir has learned. It left because it preferred being feared and could not find fear in people carrying citrus.\n\nThe signs kept changing and they kept changing them back with chalk because chalk has no time to be precious and because returning a name to a wall is the same work as returning a name to a mouth; you find the place where gravity has been misapplied and you lean. Mr Cook became an expert at the way municipal screws lie to you and at how much pressure enamel can take before it says mind yourself, and he made friends with a man with a van who is gentle with awkwardness and will come when rung because he has been rung in worse circumstances, and the man brought a screwdriver set that has learned compromise. They began to get good at it. A street noticed. It is not nonsense; the city notices when its handles are held properly. Bruntsfield Links held its own letters still for a night, as if in gratitude, and the Meadows, which has always been a place that forgives lying down, forgave two boys for lying down in a part where grass is not a good idea, and the fox watched and did not roll his eyes.\n\nIt felt for a minute like they had tricked disaster into being a job and then disaster remembers itself by getting personal. The boy with the moon of a scar came through the door of the restaurant carrying a smile like a tea tray, and if you had written the moment down simply\u2014Boy returns, scar intact, says hello\u2014you would have abased yourself before the miracle and gone home to sleep. But the boy did not say hello. He opened his mouth and the first thing that came out was the number Mr Cook had not called, and the number trembled a little as if not convinced of its own place here, and then the boy spoke with absolutely ordinary ease about tea and sauce and whether this napkin liked him and what time it was in Paris, and Mr Cook was happy and angry and ecstatically relieved and then he hit the wall of shame that is meeting a return not with gratitude but with an audit. He looked at the mouth and listened for the inside voice and could not hear it, and it was terrible, because how do you tell someone who has been delivered to you not exactly wrong that they may have been brought back right in a way that does not include themselves. He did not tell. He did his job, which is not to take from people what they bring. He fed him. He watched his hands. He watched the way he checked his pockets, and saw nothing that looked like a coding error. It would take days. They had given the Borrower boredom. It had returned the favour by giving them doubt so slender you could sharpen a thought on it.\n\nThey had a plan and hated it, which is a sign of good planning. They would take Mr Cook\u2019s hidden name, the one the blue bowl warmed and the kitchen took care of as if it housed a bird that would sing if allowed but would catch cold if asked, and they would set it in the path of the thing that had learned to ask questions and see whether it could be trained to enjoy being wrong. June spoke against it in the way generous women speak against harm they will do anyway if it is the only not-harm left; she said that teaching the Borrower the shape of a good question would, necessarily, involve admitting that good questions often get answers and that the person asked risks having to travel. Victorine said she would go in his place inside the word if she could, and there was a moment when the air in the room was a decision, and then the fox sneezed because the pepper had been left open and the spell was broken and they hung their coats of resolution back on the pegs where promises live.\n\nThe city, which has seen worse, yawned around sunset and sat down to wait for whatever it had been promised by this new crop of amateurs with their bowls and their choir and their dignified insolence. Men on ladders put lights up across streets to pretend it was always festival and not survival, and girls in jackets put glitter on their cheeks because not all magic is municipal and sometimes the glamour you need is the kind you make and wipe away, and the promoter stood on a chair outside a venue and shouted Not your name, your word, and boys held up their badges and said Soup like a prayer, and no one was embarrassed because they had been given a format that kept humiliation at bay. The Borrower tried to learn glitter and failed because glitter is loyal to trouble but not to boredom. It pivoted and went to the docks and walked along looking for old names in rust. It found plenty and found them poor substitutes for the fresh flowers it had acquired the taste for. It called them anyway as a child will call the names of ships when no one is watching, and the emptiness answered like a gull.\n\nVictorine went to sea to ask permission because she refuses to be the sort of mythical creature that helps itself to powers invented by people who have not walked in rain. She stood on the pier in Leith and bent and put her ear to the rail like a woman trying to hear whether the train inside the metal has chosen sides yet, and she asked the Forth if it would allow her to take a picture of a reflection and not the face, and the Forth, which knows about duplicity and does not get excited about it, said with a slap against a tire that it did not mind as long as she looked at the water when she pressed the shutter. She did. A mouth looked back up at her from below that was not a face attached to a boy and not a face attached to a man but something else, and its lips moved around a name that even she would not grant her camera. She took the picture anyway because permission had been granted by the only authority she would not argue with and because the act felt exactly like penance and throughout the city there was, for an hour, a dryness that did not belong to the air and did not last.\n\nThey carried the blue bowl to the bridge and set it in the light that is not light, the one June knows how to coax from breath, and Mr Cook took the little piece of paper with the first name he had not used and placed it inside on a bed that was not rice and not salt but napkins folded so precisely you would think someone polite was coming and he climbed back into his own body as if he had been standing outside it for the duration of a small errand. The Borrower came just as badly as a late guest who believes themselves irresistible. It wore no coat at all now, which is a threat or an apology depending on the angle, and it asked, with the new trick of hesitation that it had always lacked, What do you want, Mr\u2014 and then it opened its mouth for the name it had not been given and the hum was a hand set flat against it. Mr Cook heard his own name as he had never heard it, between other people\u2019s breath, and he did not answer because he is capable of not being polite when the situation requires it. He did what Lorna had done. He used the phrase that makes a boundary out of air. He said, We are closed. He said it as if closing were not a refusal but an act of caretaking, as if you shut doors so you can open them later, and the thing that borrows paused, not in boredom, this time in a new experience altogether. It had been refused as one refuses, and it looked at him with a curiosity that felt like being slowly read by someone who will not skip any words.\n\nIt left him there with his name in the bowl and walked around and tried the trick on the blue. The blue did not answer and later when he held the bowl in his hands he could feel where the question had fallen on the glaze like rain. He dried it with a towel the way a man dries a child out of the bath and the towel remembered him for it. Victorine took the square from her camera, the one that had been developed in the salt of the Forth, and laid it beside the ribbon with mutual suspicion arranged like a centrepiece, and the ribbon did not leap and the square did not burn and the radio read the capes of the British Isles like a rosary and the fox climbed onto a chair and sat as if a meeting had been convened for his benefit and everyone had forgotten why.\n\nNews spread as it does, along wires that are not wires and through the medium of the out-breath. A boy who had learned the hum taught it to his mother without explanation and she found herself at the sink later whispering vowels into the water and refusing to be embarrassed by the sensation of being old and new at once. The council man came back with a badge June had given him tucked under his lapel where only rituals could see it, and he did not talk about forms. He talked about a sign on a building that held a name for people who want to become families that had been turned to face the wall, and he turned it back, and for the first time in days he felt his job had done good that did not hurt anyone. A pile of left shoes appeared on the steps of a church because guilt is practical, and the vicar, who has seen almost everything and has the posture of a man who has been allowed to be tired, looked at them and knew that it is not his job to ask how. He arranged them as if someone might come for them later when the story permitted mercy.\n\nThere was a failure because it would be indecent to forget to record one. A boy stood on a bridge at two and forgot his badge and forgot his hum and answered to a name in a voice that tasted like Irish stout and parental permission and he went with the man with the exact shoulders and they disappeared into a warehouse that Mr Cook had not yet drawn on his placemat because he believes in the decency of paper and had wanted to spare it a grievance it could not address. They did not save him. They were not there. The next day the plate of his mouth was returned to a photograph in Victorine\u2019s belt in the careless way a child returns a borrowed book to the nearest flat surface and she cried, silently and messily, because consent had been vandalised, and it cost her nothing but the proof that a god would have taken and she does not know how to make gods and refuses to. They did what they do when they cannot undo: they told the city his name without using it, by carrying his bag for a week in their hands and by asking a waitress in a cafe to sit down and by picking up a dropped phone and leaving it on a bench where the original owner could imagine finding it.\n\nAt the end of a long day of this kind of measuring success in edible spoons, June said that they should put the bowl on the piano because a bowl that wants to travel and learn places needs to learn patience sitting with instruments that were designed for it. They did. The bowl agreed with the wood. It learned to resonate in a register that was not domestic. It learned to accept applause without cultivating a taste for it. It sat while June played the accompaniment to a song that children learn when a teacher who remembers how to teach has time, and it had to bear Lorna\u2019s scarf again because the room was not warm enough and she had decided that the scarf was now a garment for objects that might catch a cold. Mr Cook put his forehead to the lid for a minute and let it carry him and then he took a breath and stood up and went back to the restaurant because service does not forgive itself if you excuse it twice.\n\nThere is a way of living in which every ordinary gesture becomes a ritual because the things that used to be solid\u2014the names of streets, the invitations to speak, the usefulness of uniforms\u2014have become polite suggestions and you need somewhere to put your certainty. Mr Cook learned to wipe a counter as if he were writing to the Borrower a sentence that begins, Not today, and to lift a glass as if he were about to bless it with the safety of anonymity, and to answer the phone with the briskness of a doctor whose waiting room has the right number of chairs. Victorine learned to stand smaller without shrinking and to talk less even to herself because words learn secrets whether you intend them to or not, and to sleep in pieces and to accept that her belt will one day be light and this will be called an ending by people who were not there for the middle. Lorna learned to teach the hum to girls who sell shots with names that make men brag their false tolerance and to Patrol the boards where boys still insisted on photographs and to remove the ones that had been tampered with without making a fuss that would taste like fame later.\n\nThe city settled into the new arrangement the way a person settles into a new pair of shoes that are exactly right and still raise a blister on the third day. It did not complain loudly. It put its head down on the table when nobody was looking and cried twice and washed its face and got back on with it. The Borrower Not Exactly did not go away because things that are made of our habits rarely do. It altered its timetable and it began to ask questions that were easier to turn away because they reminded you of being a child who had just learned please and did not yet understand that please is not a master key. It lost interest for an afternoon and took three street signs instead in a walk along the curve of a road that thinks it is a river, and the signs were found later at the bottom of a stairwell where two boys kissed because they were late for an argument and had decided to reschedule the argument for a time when arguments were more likely to make things better. The signs were returned and someone wrote with a marker on the pole, WE KNOW YOU LOVE NAMES. COME INSIDE, and the fact that they had written COME INSIDE on a pole made Lorna choke and laugh until she had to sit.\n\nWhen the council brought railings to the bridges, because the story about bicycles and danger had been escalated in the appropriate manner and the city enjoys its theatre, Mr Cook wrote a letter as he had promised saying thank you, and he meant it, and he wore a tie he had not worn since he had told a landlord that he would not be cowed and the landlord had believed him because the tie had been expensive enough to imply a measure of safety. They stood with mugs of tea at midnight and watched as men with the right tools made edges that would not permit boys to misjudge the choice between leaning and falling, and the Borrower stood a little to the left and pretended it was a lamppost and learned nothing useful because railings belong to the part of the city that enjoys prevention, and it is a vintage it does not drink.\n\nAt last, when it had been almost quiet for two days and silence had become a sound you could rest your spine against, the bowl asked to be placed by the window with human words, and Mr Cook looked at June and June looked at Lorna and Lorna looked at Victorine and they decided to behave as if asking had been enough and not demand an essay. They placed it on the sill where steam looks for glass to bless. Outside, the name of the street had been restored precisely and the fox was carrying a slice of pizza with the solemnity of a person delivering organ donations. The bowl looked out at the reflection of its own blue in the pane and made the softest noise a bowl can make without being touched, and Victorine said she thought perhaps it wanted to see whether it could keep something safe through glass, and Mr Cook laughed a small laugh because that is the vocabulary of his whole life. He laid his name in it again because the dish has become a house and the house does not object to children making dens in the same corner every time, and then he went to the door because someone had knocked in the pattern people who come only when something matters use without knowing they do it, and when he opened it the boy with no name and the boy with the moon scar were there, not touching, not brothers, but arranged by need the way tables arrange themselves in a restaurant when you miscount and it still works.\n\nThey came in and sat and the hum rose without being asked and the radio smelled of rain and the ribbon lay exactly as long as it had to and the picture from the Forth admitted that whatever she had asked the sea for, she had received a call and had declined it, and in that refusal there was a new step to walk. The Borrower Not Exactly stood in the lane and learned the new ritual of civilians: to walk away because the room is filled with people who have agreed to mean what they say for the next hour, and it stood there a second longer than it needed to and made a little sound that could have been admiration and could have been the elastic snapping in a cheap shoe. The city exhaled. Mr Cook fetched bowls. Lorna told the boys the story about the lemons without embellishment. June tuned the air with the pinch of her fingers as if it were dough and the fox, who is pious in his own way, sat by the door and watched the weather to make sure it did not change without telling them.",

Victorine does not. She lifts a shutter with her thumb as a child might lift a curtain of ivy, and stoops to peer in at a mirror, at the slick red curve of a young man\u2019s mouth as he practices a smile he means for someone else.\n\nHe does not see her. He sees only himself and the glass of his phone. His name will not be said here because it does not last; names do not last, though they hold so much. What lasts is the soft mica gleam of his lower lip, the crooked left edge where he bit it once. He swallows. He has no idea that she is already holding him in her light.\n\nThe camera is not delicate. It is weighty as a dictionary and more decisive. She cradles it in two palms so large the strap is a ribbon. It snaps. A bright box chirrups, and the image starts to slide from its mouth.\n\n\u201cPlease, hold still,\u201d Victorine whispers, almost polite. The man pauses, startled by nothing he can place. His reflection is rose-tinted by the bar\u2019s lamps. Her voice is soft, a warmer fog within the fog, the breath that runs along a spine, not cold exactly but aware.\n\nEverything she does is for love, because of love, fuelled by the kind that legends threaten you with and prayers secretly beg for. When she kneels, plants groan under her knee and the cobbles decide to remember the weight of giants. Love asks enormous things. It asks her to follow, and she follows.\n\nShe has learned streets by the taste of them. The brine taste of Leith. The green-copper taste at the foot of the Scott Monument. The soot-and-rain taste of Cowgate where laughter falls like bottles into a bin. She leans to catch the edges, the details. The hair above a lip like a handful of barley. A mouth like a hinge. A mouth like a wound a little healed. She does not see faces. Not really. She has trained herself to see only the boundary where voice becomes world: the lips.\n\nHer camera coughs another square. She tucks the prints in a pouch at her belt, an old belt, old leather softened by oil and her own enormous warmth. The prints are damp and their shadows are still swimming into shape. It matters this \u2014 that they arrive slowly, that they have time to learn themselves. She hums to them. A small tune. It sounds like one lamp left on in the kitchen after a party, a yellow place for talking when the music has gone. She hums and the fog listens.\n\n\u201cOi,\u201d says someone. It is the boy\u2019s friend at last, shaking his phone like a torch. \u201cYou coming or what?\u201d\n\nThe young man leaves the mirror with a last little check, that crooked edge quick, a rehearsal repeated. He goes and is gone, and Victorine takes a picture of the space where his mouth had been and tucks that away too. Nothing is lost. Nothing is about to be lost, she promises herself. The bag of mouths knocks against her thigh. She rises, her shoulder briefly shouldering the low cloud that makes her hair damp, and she goes.\n\nOn the other side of the city, in the yellow light of a restaurant that is always almost closing, Mr Cook slides two panna cottas onto a tray and balances a single espresso between them like a jewel in a setting. The espresso is for the woman at table four who has talked for forty minutes about a man who does not love her. The panna cottas are for the two quiet boys at table nine who keep looking at the door.\n\n\u201cBe careful with that,\u201d Lorna says, summoning the espresso with the twitch of a hand made perfect by seventeen years of this. \u201cShe\u2019s the sort who sues.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the sort who is already disappointed,\u201d Mr Cook says. He is not unkind about it; he has learned to name things and move along. He moves along rather well. He wears black with a grey apron over it and his shoes are not fashionable but they are clean and he has his mother\u2019s shoulders on his father\u2019s bones. People call him Mr Cook because it\u2019s printed there on the receipt when they split their bill and write Don't forget Mr Cook! in the tip line with a little heart. It amuses him. He has a first name like anyone else. He has not used it much lately.\n\nOutside, the fog pushes its soft face against the panes and leaves a sheen. Mr Cook looks up and the sheen shivers, as if someone very large has breathed. He does not yet do the thing he will do, which is step outside and be ridiculous and useful at once. He delivers desserts, retrieves a credit card from beneath a bread plate, laughs when laughed at, receives a story he didn\u2019t ask for, and when it is all done he locks the door himself because the owner has gone home and because tonight, as so many nights, the city is a little unattached and requires someone to say yes, there, the end, we are closed, we are safe.\n\n\u201cDid you hear,\u201d Lorna says, tying a scarf so bright it raises the room a degree, \u201cabout the thing down by Dean Village? About the odd footprints in the mud like\u2014 like something that had no business wearing shoes?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a hundred things with no business wearing shoes,\u201d Mr Cook says. He washes his hands again by habit. The tap squeals; his wrists are thin, the tendons trick strings. \u201cWas it you out there in the mud looking for news?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my cousin\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s pal and it was on his story,\u201d she says. \u201cIt had that little face you can add with the sick eyebrows, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can just about manage an email,\u201d Mr Cook says. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me for eyebrows.\u201d He dries his hands. He has a particular way of folding towels into the drawer, so they open all the same way, like books ready at the library. The order is not about fear. It is about harm reduction. That\u2019s what his therapist called it once, back when he could afford a therapist. He could afford one again now, he supposes, but then who would he talk to about it? He thinks of talking. He does not call anyone.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Lorna says, and glances through the fog toward the street. \u201cYou going home?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a minute,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to wait for the dishwasher to finish so I know it is not going to flood and murder us all in our sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a poet, Mr Cook.\u201d\n\nHe is not a poet. He can\u2019t keep a line in his head to save it. He says goodnight and watches the door seal itself around Lorna as she peels herself away into the city and the city takes her back, as it always does. He listens to the dishwasher and the tick of the clock on the wall that is chronically slow because its battery is a traitor. At last he shuts the last lights and steps into the grey.\n\nHe walks home on a route that is not the shortest but is the one he likes because it carries him along the Water of Leith, where the world is narrower and there are foxes who are not troubled by men. His shoes make soft sounds. A bus sighs out on the big road, sounding like someone who has decided to try again anyway.\n\nIt happens quickly, in the kind of quiet that belongs to a church and a bus station at 2 a.m. The path dips and curves and he is in a little hollow made by trees and walls, and ahead of him is not a fox. The thing ahead is a shadow and then a corner of someone\u2019s coat and then \u2014 a face, but not the face, because what he sees is the mouth and what he sees past the mouth is the hand that lifts something heavy and square.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Mr Cook says, a thing to say when you see something odd but not yet a reason to panic. \u201cYou all right?\u201d\n\nIt is a boy, maybe twenty. He has the pale skin of a person who has spent too many nights helping bars fill their bins. He is focusing on staying upright. He\u2019s focused on his phone. He does not turn. The person with the heavy square does not turn, either, and Mr Cook sees then that the heavy square is a camera, old-looking and severe.\n\nHe hears it: the little animal machine sound. Dispatch. The boy\u2019s mouth is pink in the flash. His lips, to be precise, and they are very slightly chapped, the kind of chapping from kissing in the cold and not from a deficiency in chapstick. The flash is not a flash \u2014 it is more like the fog catching fire and then deciding not to.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Mr Cook says again, and now there is purpose in it. He takes a stride nearer. The person holding the camera raises a hand as if to say wait. The hand is not possible. It is very large. Not big like rugby. Large like door. Large like a kind of slow-falling weather.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s close enough,\u201d the person says. A woman\u2019s voice, low and apologetic and thick with something like rain. \u201cI won\u2019t hurt you. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m working.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re what?\u201d He stops on the word working because there is a comedy to it and the comedy is a place he can breathe. \u201cYou\u2019re working? At this hour? Is it for a magazine?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is for someone I love,\u201d and God help everyone, she means it.\n\nHe sees her as the fog moves just a little. She cannot be as tall as the trees. She cannot be alive, not at that size and angle, the Firth smell on her hair and the wet of a long walk under a low sky. She is stooping. She is trying to be shy. Her coat is stitched from a tent, or from something that once had a mast, and her face is as careful as a librarian's hand about to turn a fragile page.\n\nThe boy mutters, \u201cMate?\u201d to nobody exactly. He is free, and does not know it yet. He has been captured and released. The photograph slides out like a tongue. The boy\u2019s friend howls from the bridge that he is paying for the taxi without him. He goes up to the bridge in pieces \u2014 not literally; in that drunken way that life becomes composed of stairs and breath and stairs.\n\nVictorine holds the picture to make it warm. She looks up at Mr Cook and for a moment something like an understanding visits them with the fog: neither of them wants to frighten what is already always frightened. It is an odd moment to be introduced.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a giant,\u201d he says, because he is a simple man in a complicated room.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd you\u2019re a waiter.\u201d\n\nThe answer is so exact it tips him forward. \u201cI don\u2019t usually bring the desserts down here,\u201d he says. The joke falls and makes a small sound somewhere near the water.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t hurt them,\u201d she says. She nods toward the bridge. The camera strap swings like a black river on her shoulder. \u201cI am making a book. I am making proof. I am\u2014\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t know what she is. She stops.\n\n\u201cWhat is it,\u201d he asks, \u201cyou\u2019re proving?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I loved him,\u201d she says. \u201cThat I know where the voice comes from when it kisses. That I can make him out of the world even though the world keeps eating him.\u201d\n\nWords like that are a danger. They are too bare. They are a sore you have picked clean and now it gleams, slick and helpless. He is used to plates; he is not used to this. He hears, as if from a distance, his own voice shape a question that is not his own: \u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know him,\u201d she says, and the disappointment in that is mild and absolute, a weather pattern that determines crops. \u201cHe is no one. He is everyone. Don\u2019t worry. It is not a murder, what I am doing. It is the opposite of murder.\u201d She produces the second photograph and holds them side by side, two boys\u2019 mouths already turning toward themselves, becoming, in the way of such pictures, both more real and more partial. \u201cThere,\u201d she says. \u201cLook how they try to say, even when they are doing nothing, one more thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t,\u201d he says. He has no right to say it. He says it anyway, as someone might reach for a glass falling. \u201cThey\u2019re not for you. And if they were, you would not be able to keep them safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho keeps anything safe,\u201d she says, not unkindly. \u201cWhat do you keep safe? The panna cottas? The teaspoons?\u201d She looks out over the black water. \u201cI keep these. I keep them.\u201d\n\nHe should call someone. He should turn and run and find a phone box like a film and telephone the police. He should move, should make a simple ordinary sound that will break the enchantment and make her regular sized. But the fog does not allow for ordinary; the water is a dark semaphore; she is a shape written on the stone buildings by a hand that is used to writing in the margins.\n\n\u201cMy name is Mr Cook,\u201d he says, and this time it sounds like a line he might like to keep. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019re frightening them whether you mean to or not. And anyway \u2014 anyway you can\u2019t go about at night taking folk\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cLips,\u201d she says, helpful.\n\n\u201cPhotographs,\u201d he says, and pinches the bridge of his nose to keep his thoughts from slope. \u201cPhotographs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I will. I have to finish before the world changes and starts to sing a different song.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens if you don\u2019t,\u201d he asks. He cannot stop himself.\n\nShe considers this in the way someone might consider the speed of a train they are about to miss. \u201cHe will close his mouth,\u201d she says. \u201cHe will close it forever. And I will never hear it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d he says, useless, and just then a fox crosses their path with a piece of bread in its mouth and the world opens its hands again and the fog rolls with the contentment of a cat that has chosen a lap.\n\nThey stand like that for a breath. She is much too big, and he is much too brave and not enough. She tucks the two photographs away. She steps back once, twice. The trees list as if a wind had changed direction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry if you are frightened,\u201d she says. \u201cPlease tell them they are beautiful and that they do not know it yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone tells them that,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is the particular curse of them. It is why they keep going out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is good then,\u201d she says, as if that settled anything. She nods, a serious tilt, and then she is gone, as in gone. Not slowly. It is a series of edits: her shoulder, her hand, the shadow made by her knee, the leaf that had been stuck to her coat, the idea of her. The fog unknots. He is alone. He does not call anyone. He goes home, and his bedsheets are cold.\n\nIn the morning the city acts as if it has always been an honest saxophone. Ten o\u2019clock light bends itself around corners; cats repair themselves. Mr Cook drinks a coffee that tastes like soil and rain and suspicion. He doesn\u2019t speak of it at the restaurant because he will be laughed at and because it is not that kind of story. He will tell it one day to someone he has not yet met; not now. Now is for orders and orders up.\n\nA group of students come in with scarves and hangover faces and say things like \u201cthe vibe in here\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m literally starving\u201d and laugh as if that were legal. Two young men sit near the window and arrange themselves in the light so their skin could be listened to by cameras. He finds he is watching their mouths. He takes orders and tries not to make a cathedral out of everything.\n\n\u201cMake an exception,\u201d Lorna says, pushing him with an elbow as she reaches for a glass. \u201cCome out tonight. We\u2019ll go up to the Meadows, there\u2019s a thing on. Food trucks. Music. People. You can\u2019t sit in your flat with your radio on like an old man choking on the shipping forecast.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will do that exact thing,\u201d Mr Cook says. \u201cI am a creature of habit, and my habit is loneliness.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiar,\u201d she says, and she is right; the habit is attention. He lives on watching. You can tell things, what people want, what they will eat, what they came here to be told about themselves. He is a doctor of menus and an amateur hydrologist of shame. He has watched so long that it is a kind of marriage.\n\nHe goes to the Meadows. He does. It is all too bright. The bands sound like they have just read a note about how to be joyous and are trying it out for the first time. People sit on damp grass anyway because they are young and invincible and because their trousers are not expensive. He buys a paper plate of noodles so hot the steam becomes political. He stands and he watches mouths.\n\nVictorine is not there. Of course she is not there. She does not like daylight. She does not like crowds except as a field in which mouths bloom and she can visit like a bee at night. But there is a rumour that she is always not far, a gravitational wrongness, and when someone laughs there is an extra beat after it where you might hear a camera settle itself against a palm like a bird on a wrist.\n\nMr Cook hears nothing. He sees nothing. He goes home later by a route he does not usually take and discovers, in a lane behind a chemist, a photograph pinned to a corkboard among flyers for rooms to let and a man with a van: a small square of lips. No face. No eyes. Just a mouth slightly open and the pink, faintly wet interior where someone else\u2019s name would sit before it came out. The photograph has a small pin through one corner. It is labelled in a hand that has to be big: Aidan, Fountainbridge, likes sugar.\n\nHe takes it. He does not know why he does this except that it feels like an act of theft in favour of the world. He has a drawer with coasters and spare keys and packets of soy sauce, all the items that are both useful and in the wrong place. He puts the photograph there. He does not sleep well. He dreams of kissing his own knuckles because they are familiar.\n\nThe days turn. Victorine goes about her work like a tide with a timetable. She knows the stairwells where boys pause to check their breath. She knows the bathrooms in pubs where boys rehearse expressions. She knows which nights they will go home alone and which nights they will walk too fast and which nights they will make a loved one of a stranger for a bit. She does not take them. She takes only the soft space at the edge of being taken: the lips.\n\nStreetlights oblige her. Sometimes they are kind, and the sodium makes the mouths golden as a harvest; sometimes they are brutal, and everything is blue and exact; sometimes the light is only the phone, and then the light is a kiss of its own. She hums, and the humming becomes a sound that young men do not know they hear and it makes them stand still for two seconds longer than they would have.\n\nThere are stories. Boys tell boys. They say there is a woman who looks at your mouth and you forget your name and for the next week you bite the inside of your cheek and it tastes like someone else\u2019s cigarettes. They say she brings luck. They say she is a monster. They say she is tall. They say she is a camera with a person attached. They say not to go over the bridge. They go over the bridge.\n\nMr Cook grows a habit that is not so different from his other habits. He walks home later. He will not admit to himself that he is looking for her because that would be romance, and he does not have the warranty for romance. He checks corkboards now. He sees more of the squares. Always the lips. Always a little name, a little detail. Harvey, Tollcross, whistles. Jamal, Holyrood, hates olives. Finn, Stockbridge, sings in the shower. He takes one. He leaves another. He is a thief and a curator. He has a tiny museum of mouths, ridiculous, secret.\n\n\u201cNo offence,\u201d Lorna says when she comes round one night because the heating is broken in her place and his is not, \u201cbut your walls are a wee bit bare for a person with feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a selection of photographs of people\u2019s mouths,\u201d he says, and waits for her to ask. She does not, lately. She has seen stranger. She warms her hands at his radiator and tells him about a man with a moustache that requires insurance.\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do with your life,\u201d she asks finally, not like a scold but like a friend who knows that life is a cupboard you avoid opening because the saucepan lids are waiting to jump out.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is probably it.\u201d He does not sound sad. It is not sad. There is so much to do, plates to catch, forks to deliver. Still. He presses his thumb against the edge of a photograph in the drawer and feels its small precise pain.\n\nOn a Wednesday that has not made up its mind to rain or not, the newspaper prints a story that is trying to be cheerful about the crime it is reporting. Missing: two young men last seen on separate streets. They are not the first missing. The city is a large, complicated cupboard. The paper cites family members. It uses the phrase out of character. It uses the phrase police appeal. It uses pictures taken from social media and the mouths in the pictures are of course there, loud and patterned with the imperfections that make all beauty possible.\n\nMr Cook eats his toast without tasting it and folds the newspaper twice and then again and then puts it out for the recycling as if it were a dangerous bottle. At work he pours a pint too quickly and has to let it settle like a mood. He does not speak. Lorna speaks. Lorna speaks enough for two. It helps. It almost addresses the problem. He is not stupid. He is arranging his fear on a shelf. He is also choosing a time and a place.\n\nHe walks down to Dean Village after midnight, when the stone looks like skin and the water looks like a language you half remember how to read. He waits on the path. Foxes skitter. Students skid. He waits. He does not call her name because he does not know it. He has named her three different things and none of them stuck. He waits.\n\nShe arrives like weather you hear about from other towns first. A smell of salt. The sense that the mass of the air has been miscalculated. He hears the strap of the camera before he sees her, the leather song of it. He stands up, because he had been sitting like a pen lid on a bench, and his legs are pins.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d she says, not surprised. \u201cYou are the waiter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you are the proof,\u201d he says. His hands are at his sides. He would like to be much braver than he is and much stupider; he would like to be the person who runs at a giant with a broom handle shouting be off with you, foul spirit, be gone back to where you came from. He is not that person. He is a person with a good memory for orders. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have had too many,\u201d she says, but he hears something in it this time, a slip, the echo of a letter. \u201cVictorine,\u201d she says eventually, and the name falls like a coin into a box that didn\u2019t know it was hungry. \u201cVictorine.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cVictorine, I\u2019m asking you. You have to stop.\u201d\n\nShe looks at him as if he has asked her to take her heart out and boil it for tea. \u201cI am nearly done,\u201d she says. The pictures at her belt are thicker. The belt bows, tired under the weight of proof. \u201cI am making a gift. He will be complete soon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho,\u201d he says again, stubborn in the way a door is stubborn when the paint has stuck. \u201cWho is he.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was small,\u201d she says, as if she is reading from a list in her mind that is written in a child\u2019s handwriting. \u201cHe had a laugh like teeth. He kept money in his left shoe. He told jokes that were stolen from someone else and tried to blush when caught, but he could not. His mother called him a big daft boy in a way that meant stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone,\u201d Mr Cook says gently, and he can hear it, the grief, the bigness of love that made a person huge because how else can you carry it, \u201chas a him like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd everyone is failing him. I will not.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey are disappearing,\u201d he says, each word a plate he cannot drop. \u201cBoys. Men. The newspaper. This is not nothing. I don\u2019t know what it is yet, but it\u2019s not nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not taking them,\u201d she says, scornful now and with a hurt that makes the river lower itself. \u201cI would never. I am collecting only the outer map of a voice. If something is happening it is happening without me.\u201d\n\nHe believes her. He hates that he does. He swears inwardly with small careful words. He looks at the black slots of the closes and at the lights in a few windows where the late ones draw. \u201cThen help me,\u201d he says, surprising himself with the taste of the word help. \u201cIf you know their routes and their habits, if you know their mouths you may know the rest. Help me find what is wrong. Please.\u201d\n\nShe is enormous and she is tender like a streetlamp in fog. She looks at him. \u201cYou are a waiter,\u201d she repeats, as if this were an ancestry.\n\n\u201cAnd you are a giant,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are neither of us quite trained for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will do it anyway,\u201d she says. It is not a question, and in the not a question is all of the disaster and all of the devotion of what will happen next.\n\nShe gives him a photograph. He flinches because it feels like a kind of coupling, to be given something like that. It is a mouth with a little scar above it, a moon of a scar. It is labelled Kellan, Marchmont, left-handed. \u201cHe is missing,\u201d she says simply. \u201cHe did not come home. His brother cried in the street but he did not keep the tears. He wiped them on his sleeve and threw the sleeve away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat time,\u201d Mr Cook asks. He hates the procedural sound of him. He nods at his own nodding and dislikes himself. \u201cWhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d she says. \u201cAn hour after I saw him. He was merry. He was singing a song that told the street what it was, silly man. I took his lips. Then he was gone.\u201d\n\nThe river is loud as if it wants to be a witness. They stand like judges who are not allowed to sit and like children who are not allowed to speak. Mr Cook feels the hinge of his next few months seal.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cTell me everything. Every boy you saw that night. Every lip. Every wrongness.\u201d\n\nShe tells him. She has a memory like the city. Fussy. Fond. She does not miss a thing once she has decided it is worth not missing. He writes nothing down. He will keep it in his head for later. He will go back and back. He will ask questions that offend. He will dress them as if they were amuse-bouches and everyone will swallow them without thinking. He will stalk the way a waiter stalks during a rush \u2014 not predatory, not noble. Necessary.\n\n\u201cYou will get hurt,\u201d Victorine says by way of a benediction.\n\n\u201cI am perpetually already hurt,\u201d he says without self-pity and the night accepts that.\n\nShe rises as if the ground had been holding her by the ankle in a memory and lets go. He feels the shift of air. She is patient with her largeness. She treads lightly and still the city knows and the city forgives her. She goes and the bench is a bench again and the river is a river again and Mr Cook is a man in a coat who will now have to go and be more than a waiter and more than a man who owns eight photographs he would have to explain by leaving the country.\n\nIf you asked him to tell you the thing that began it all, he would say the fog moving and the camera sound, an old technology making a small creature noise. He would say the way her hand lifted, apologetic, and how his own hand did not lift back in fear. He would say he saw her love and it was bleeding out of her like light.\n\nHe would also say a very plain and silly thing, which is: He had had enough of being the one who cleared away what was left after. He wanted to be first at the table. He wanted to be the one who put something down on it that mattered. He put down his soul then. Or something like that. Something that looks like a napkin in the right light, folded a particular way. He would smile when he said it and you would not know whether to believe him or not. He would like that. He has always liked giving other people options.\n\nIn the weeks that follow, as the city keeps singing its long song about itself and the notices go up and down on noticeboards and the photographs travel in secret from a belt to a drawer to a fist, people will say there came a change. It is not a change anyone can nail to a date. It is not about weather though the weather does its part. It is the way doors are opened at different speeds. It is the way boys check the corners of their mouths for honesty. It is the way a waiter asks too many questions without making anyone feel interrogated.\n\nIt is the way a giant, who wanted only to collect enough light to call love true, finds herself participating in a hunt she did not intend and will pay for. It is the way a city, which is so old it should not be surprised by anything, takes a breath and holds it a long time.",

                              "content": "It begins with a map that is not a map, a paper placemat from the restaurant which Mr Cook has turned to the blank side and sectioned with a biro into neighbourhoods that only he recognises. He draws the Water of Leith like a vein he has learned how to find with two fingers and a patience learned from waiting for kettles. He dots pubs, and the long elastic places between them where boys stretch into their futures under streetlights and mistake the stretching for destiny. He writes names in margins and facts in the places where bread plates would go. It looks ridiculous. It is unshakeable.\n\nHe takes the placemat to the kitchen and tapes it under the bottom shelf where Lorna will not find it until she kneels to reach the last bag of sugar and then he will have to explain himself without warning. He likes the risk. It makes him feel like a person with a room in his life that is not visible from the front door. That room smells of warmed milk and pencilled lines and foxes crossing narrower spaces than you would think a fox could cross.\n\nThe first thing he learns is that he has already been learning all along. It turns out that watching the angle at which a man lifts his glass is not so different from watching the angle at which a man stops to check his reflection. It turns out that knowing which table wants to order dessert but needs to be told it is not embarrassing is the same skill as recognising which young man has decided to be brave because he has almost been caught by something and wants to prove the city wrong. He does not call the police because the police would do what the police do; he is doing harm reduction in a room that does not have a sign saying that. He carries in his head a list of other people\u2019s sons and the places their mouths were last known to be speaking.\n\nHe goes to Marchmont because Kellan had a scar, and scars have councils they belong to. He visits the shop where a woman sits behind a counter selling stamps and lottery tickets and invites good luck to cross the threshold in increments. He asks if she remembers a boy who paid for cigarettes with a five-pound note folded into a square as if it were a secret letter. She does not. He goes next door and asks a man who has cut the same heads of hair for twenty years to notice that the wind changed last week. The man says that boys come and go and that their mouths always smile when they look at themselves, never when they look at other people. The man is barber-cynical about it; he is not wrong, but he is lazy with the truth.\n\nThere is a bouncer outside a place with a name that suggests a speakeasy but which only speaks loudly. The bouncer has a stool he refuses to sit on because he does not intend to get comfortable. Mr Cook has brought him coffee before because kindness is a tourism guide that gets you behind the rope. He brings one now. He asks about Kellan without saying missing, and the bouncer\u2019s eyes put together the letters anyway and they move with a faint tiredness that looks like respect. He saw Kellan leave around one with two friends; one of the friends can sing any song that begins with a U, for a bet. They turned right, towards the Meadows. There was fog in that direction, a fog that looked like it had a schedule.\n\nIn the Meadows he finds trampled grass in round shapes where friends had sat themselves and their doubts in rings. He walks the paths and watches the mouths of the statues, because he is superstitious in a slow way, and he asks a hot chocolate truck if they recognise a boy with a scar. The hot chocolate truck has the manners of a small house; it invites and it sticks to its opinions. The woman working there says there were two lads who came late and asked for extra cream and wrote their initials on the lids like it was a contract. She had thought about it later because the initials were the same except for one letter and it felt like a game she wasn\u2019t a part of.\n\nIt is nothing. It is everything. He notes it on his placemat map when he gets home, the letter that was not the same, the cream that was extra as if sweetness were an armour. He does not sleep, but this is not important because sleep is a place he has lately disliked. In the morning he will take croissants from a paper bag that lies about its own flakiness, and he will butter them like forgiveness and feed himself the way one feeds a dog that has done something almost clever.\n\nVictorine does not have a map because she is the map. She has walked the city until the city walked her back, until she could tell you the taste of every bridge and the sound of every close when it swallows you and makes you echo. She did not intend to help. She intended to finish her book of proofs and go to a place where proofs do not matter because love once done does not undo. But he asked, and she is susceptible to questions asked without swagger. At first she tells herself she is merely aligning her routes to his. Then she stops telling herself anything and listens for new sounds.\n\nThere is one: a tutting in the fog that does not belong to her. It is the sound a mother makes when she recognises crumbs in her best bed. It comes from corners. It is not the city; it is something that wants to be spared the trouble of learning streets by taste. It is something that would borrow. That is how she thinks of it, not as a hunter, not as a killer, but as a borrower who returns things wrong-side-out if it returns them at all. The first night she hears it she gentles her large hands as if to hold it; the fog makes room for her and the room does not contain it.\n\nThere are stories now that have learned to travel without bodies. Lorna brings them to the back door with the bin bags and the lemon rinds. A boy said he heard his own voice on his phone by the canal, and he answered himself and agreed to meet to return a jacket he had not lost. A taxi driver swears that his last fare vanished while the lights were at red, which is not physically possible and so must be administrative. A girl with a tattoo of an anchor on her forearm said she had kissed a boy who tasted like photographs; she could not explain what flavour that was except that it made her teeth ache in a way she did not dislike. None of the stories are helpful until they are, and that is the problem with stories: they welcome you in and then they make you look at your watch and realise the dark has moved closer.\n\nMr Cook goes to the canal because stories like water. He stands in the gap between buildings where the wind becomes interested in scarves. He spends twenty minutes making small talk with a crow that is not invested. He watches a student rehearsing being unbothered by the cold by leaving his jacket open and looking at his phone in a way that says the phone is the heat source for his illusion. He sees, finally, what he did not know he was hoping to see; it is a man in a coat with the wrong shoulders.\n\nThe shoulders are not wrong in shape. They are wrong in understanding: the coat has been taught the meaning of shoulders by someone who has seen a picture of shoulders, perhaps drawn by a child, and the coat has studied it and passed the test and failed the practice. The hands holding the phone are fine; the hands cut the air like knives cutting air. The shoes, though. The shoes are the problem and the proof. They are black and plain and new and they are left and left. Both left. The gait is a stitch undone every step; the weight lands not heel-to-toe but heel-to-question-mark and you can see the mud trying to be polite about it and failing, flinging up its cheeks to avoid being trodden on by a riddle.\n\nHe does not follow because following has its glamour and its disaster and he would prefer to keep his disaster domestic. He lets the wrong-shouldered coat go, and he watches the student watching his phone begin to tilt his head as if he is hearing his name spoken at a distance in the voice of, perhaps, someone who once told him not to go out without a hat. Mr Cook moves then, very quickly. He is not strong and he is not violent, but he is precise and he is in the habit of interrupting. He walks directly up to the student and says, with a voice he uses when a plate is about to fall, that the jacket is not at the bridge. The student blinks, and because youth is the most superstitious thing going he believes what he has been told because it was told with confidence. He shrugs, rude by accident, and goes back indoors.\n\nMr Cook turns his head to see if the wrong-shouldered coat has turned its head. It has. The face is a face, entirely credible, the face of someone you would not describe if you were trying to describe the face of someone you would not remember. The mouth is wrong. Not visibly. Visibly it is perfect, as if chosen from a list that began with \u201cconvincing\u201d and ended with \u201cno query.\u201d But the tongue is unused to lying behind those teeth. His father had had a speech impediment that was not a stammer and not a lisp and was simply a relationship with consonants that required negotiation. This mouth has none of that. It has nothing. It is a mouth that arrived with instructions written in a handwriting nobody could read. It is suddenly, to Mr Cook, impossibly sad.\n\nHe goes home quickly, as if somebody were trying to catch up with him and might, if he slowed, ask him his name and he might tell them. He feeds his plants which do not require feeding but appreciate the theatre. He opens the drawer where the photographs live and counts them although he knows exactly how many there are. One is missing. He is not given to melodrama and he is at home and he is not admitting that the room is smaller than it was when he left it, but he shouts anyway, a wordless thing that is the sound he makes when a stack of plates goes and his body moves before his pride. He checks the floor, the radiator edge, the gap behind the bookshelf where crumbs go to plan their future. It is gone. The photograph of Aidan, Fountainbridge, likes sugar has removed itself like a card from a deck a magician has taught to think.\n\nHe thinks of calling Lorna because what is friendship if not calling someone when your photographs are escaping. He does not. He thinks of calling Victorine and cannot because he does not have a number or a way of speaking; he has fog and a river and a bench and weather. He goes to the bench. That night it rains in a committed fashion and he refuses to be impressed by it. His coat is not good enough for this sort of romance and he is wet the way a towel is wet after a hotel tries to persuade you that towels can be thin and loyal.\n\nVictorine arrives as if the rain were being generous for once and had decided to drape itself around her. He tells her about the photograph without drama because he has expended his drama on the floor looking for paper. She listens with the attention of someone reading a telegram the war wrote. She says, very quietly, that her pictures do not leave without her permission. He says that the city has never been good at permission. She kneels like a saint with terrible knees and reaches a hand into the bag at her belt and the bag reaches back, a little. She draws out the photograph he lost. It is heavier. It has a dampness around the edges that is not rain.\n\n\u201cWhere,\u201d he asks, less startled than he would have been last week. \u201cWhere did it go.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone wanted to see if the page could be turned backwards,\u201d she says. She cradles the square like bread. \u201cI think it learned the beginning of a trick. I think the trick will be dangerous when it has practiced.\u201d\n\nHe hates thinking about tricks when what he wants is to think about soup. There is no soup. There is fog and this woman and a river that behaves like an archive. He asks her if she has seen the wrong shoes. She nods with the same patience she uses when a boy bites his mouth and makes a little crescent that will be beautiful when it heals. She has. She sees them most on the edges of bridges. She has watched them stop as if choosing which names to taste next. They interest her in the way a wasp that will not leave the kitchen interests you if you are someone who refuses to close the window on principle.\n\nThey make a plan of the sort that will make people who want plans laugh. It involves chalk stolen from a pub quiz where the quizmaster uses it to draw pictures when the questions grow tired. It involves sugar, because Aidan likes sugar and the city has opinions about lure. It involves a fox, because of course it involves a fox. The chalk is for the stones by the bridge. The sugar is poured into a little drift near one of the lamp-posts that has learned to be kind. The fox has not signed anything, but Mr Cook has a relationship with a fox who knows his whistle and will come and take bread from his hand with the quick gentleness of someone who has learned to take quick, gentle things while the engines of the city are leaving.\n\nThey arrange the chalk into careless markings and then into careful ones disguised as careless ones. Victorine hums to the lamp-post and asks it to make its light a little warmer, just for an hour, and it agrees because it is flattered that someone has remembered to ask. The sugar waits. The fox also waits, which is not like a fox and suggests that the fox is not waiting for sugar, but for a story. Mr Cook hides, which is not like him, and is good practice for being something other than a waiter.\n\nThe wrong-shouldered coat comes the way a rumour comes when it is tired of being so light and would like to see what it feels like to be a body. It stops exactly where they thought. It breathes in, and you can see it take the breath seriously, as if breaths were money you had to account for. It speaks into the student night without opening its mouth. It speaks like an app that is ashamed of itself. It says a name that is not Mr Cook\u2019s. It says, Finn. It says, Finn, did you leave your card. It says it in a voice that is trying to be an apology and failing because it has not learned regret with any of the correct muscles.\n\nThe fox moves first. It pads to the sugar, pretends to be greedier than it is, and then sneezes, a small explosion like a cartoon that has chosen to be elegant. The sneeze does what a sneeze does: it removes illusions by forcing a pause. The wrong-shouldered coat turns further than a person turns, as if joints were a story rather than a law. It shows its shoes to the chalk. That is the point. The chalk records without being interested. The chalk writes down the way the weight moves, heel-spiral, heel-spiral, the way the left-left shoes make the gait into a harvest of mistakes. Victorine holds her patient breath and Mr Cook holds his and the city cannot, in fairness, hold its because it has too many lungs between it and the sea. The coat looks at the sugar and then not at the sugar, because there is a precision in the way it rejects human lure and it will not be tricked into sweetness. Mr Cook learns something he does not want: that what wants them does not want them because they are delicious, but because they are impossible.\n\nHe does not jump out. He does not reveal anything. He stands very still and lets the chalk do what chalk does. He sees the print of a sole that is brand-new and wrong. He sees, pressed into the heavy white, a pattern that is not a pattern: the heel bears letters, but the letters are nonsense. The letters say NO HAND. The letters are an instruction like the ones on packaging. He thinks, absurdly, of his towels: open the same way, like books ready at the library. He wonders if perhaps there is a library where this thing learned to be with us, and if the books were not alphabetised.\n\nThey do not catch it. They do not even get close. It slides away like a memo withdrawn before it can be pinned to a board. It does not mind that it has been observed because observation is not the same as interference and in the city you can die of being observed. They let it go. They keep the chalk, which is not nothing, and the way the light coloured the sugar for a second as if it were gold someone had dropped accidentally. Mr Cook kneels and touches one of the NO HAND letters. His finger is white for a bit and then the rain lifts it and returns him.\n\nVictorine retrieves from her belt a photograph that is not hers and not his. It is a mouth he does not know and a mole that is very exactly placed like a punctuation mark with perfect meaning. She says the name that belongs to it because the name is written on the back and the writing is someone else\u2019s; it is Kellan\u2019s brother\u2019s writing. The photograph had sat in a wallet. She did not steal it. It found its way to her because paper learns the shortcuts grief opens. She gives the picture to Mr Cook not because it will help but because sometimes you give the thing you cannot carry to someone who has volunteered to carry. He takes it like bread. He feels his life actively changing its hinge.\n\nLorna finds the placemat map because she is the kind of person who is chosen by drawer handles that jam and require a particular wrist to coax them. She is halfway through telling Mr Cook a story about a woman who ate half a lemon tart with her eyes closed because she wanted to prove to someone that she could feel pleasure without needing to locate it, when she sees the map. She stops and kneels and reads. She does not laugh. She says, Oh lamb, which is something she has not called him since the day he told her that he could not be the person other people needed him to be at breakfast. She folds the placemat carefully along the lines of the Water of Leith and tucks it into her bag without asking. He says nothing because consent has already been managed between them in a thousand small ways. She is in. He did not invite her because he is bad at inviting help; she is not waiting for his good behaviour.\n\nHer contribution is immediate and unappreciated by the part of Mr Cook that would like to be in charge. She goes to the places he cannot go because he is not a woman who can be angry in a way that opens doors. She asks bartenders and taxi drivers questions a woman asks when she is a friend of a friend\u2019s sister and she has a photograph and the photograph has light that tells the truth about who will miss a boy. She learns something Mr Cook could not have learned because men lie to men about fear and they tell women the truth in order to be allowed to continue to think of themselves as decent. She learns that a boy who hated olives disappeared near a bin that smelled of olives because the restaurant had put them out with the coffee grounds. She learns that there is someone who calls himself a promoter who promotes nothing; he stands outside clubs and asks for names and pretends to know everyone. He wears scarves to summer events and in winter he tries being serious. He is not the wrong-shouldered coat. He is a different, older wrongness, and she flicks him away like a coat made of a wish that never came true.\n\nVictorine watches all this with a complicated affection that she is careful not to show. She has been told her whole life not to be too much of anything; she is the definition of too much and she is the opposite of it. She comes when called by whistles, by changes in pressure, by a boy\u2019s mother sitting on a doorstep and finally letting a sound out that had been in her for twenty-four years and needed a witness. She does not take pictures of mothers. She takes pictures of boys. She tells herself it keeps the scale right because otherwise she would be too moved and break her own camera with her hands. Sometimes, at night, alone on a roof where the city reminds itself it has vertebrae, she holds one of the squares to her cheek and the cheek remembers the temperature it is missing.\n\nShe had a childhood, which is not obvious, and it is relevant now apparently because she cannot stop thinking of the man she loved when she was a size you would call manageable. His name is not for here, as before, but he had a mouth like a comma. He would begin and then pause and then finish and she had loved that about him because she had thought it meant he was thinking, and perhaps it did. He had been taken from the world not by any of the dramatic things that make stories easier to tell; he had been taken by a sequence of small errors nobody owned. She is making a book of lips because someone somewhere had to own something about it and she, it turned out, had hands big enough to hold the blame without it piercing the skin.\n\nThe city remains itself and then more itself. It has always had a taste for repetition and now it repeats warnings in new fonts. Someone writes on a wall with chalk that says Do Not Answer Your Name After Midnight. Someone else writes underneath, Unless You Are Hungry, and someone else crosses that out and writes Unless You Are Very Hungry, and someone else writes Unless It Is Your Mother, and beneath it, If It Is Your Mother Make Her Prove It By Telling You a Secret Only Your Dentist Knows. Someone adds, Teeth, and underlines it twice with a flourish that suggests a person in love with solutions. It is funny until it is not. It is not the sort of funny that warms. It is the other kind.\n\nMr Cook has to work, and there is a Saturday that behaves like a pizza oven. He is very good. He is extraordinary. He moves like a song about knives that is not threatening, just informative. He looks at mouths constantly. It is a problem. He spills nothing, which is suspicious. He asks too many questions and nobody minds because he does it with the generosity that makes you forget the shape of the question and remember only that you enjoyed answering. A table of four boys are celebrating a birthday and pretending not to. He watches them blow out a candle in a way that makes the air think about staying. He watches them put on their coats and choose the order in which to check their pockets for keys, phones, pride.\n\nWhen they leave he breaks his rule and follows them at a professional distance. He hates himself for it because it feels like surveillance and he is a waiter not a policeman and the word policeman tastes like a spoon in a chipped cup. He walks on the other side of the street. He listens. He hears, astonishingly, the city trying to help. A bus coughs exactly when one of the boys says his own name. A siren runs past at the moment the boy repeats it. The sound covers the slip. The boys do not notice. He thinks of sending the bus a letter. He thinks that perhaps the city is on their side for now because it likes a hunt when it has time for one.\n\nIn the moment he most dislikes the man he has become, one of the boys turns and looks right at him and says, You all right, mate, in a kindness he did not expect. He likes the boy\u2019s mouth because it is the shape of a mouth that has just learned how to say sorry and also how to mean thank you so much. He is not a thief, so he lets them go. He walks in the opposite direction and is punished immediately by stumbling into a small crowd that has arranged itself around a guitarist doing something with his thumb that should be illegal. He tries to pass. The guitarist sings a name that is not Mr Cook\u2019s and is and always will be, and for a second there is a heat in the back of his eyes that is either grief or the first great love of his life arriving late and furious. He stands his ground. He puts his hands in his pockets and counts his coins and his breath, one, two, three, four. The song misses its chance.\n\nThe chalk prints by the bridge survive one more rain and then are gone, but Mr Cook has them, because of course he does. He has them because Lorna, who is tired of everyone's tendencies towards metaphor when what is needed is an action that can be ticked off, pressed a sheet of brown butcher's paper down hard and peeled it up slow so that the chalk came with it like a bruised sky. The letters NO HAND transferred themselves as if they were bored where they were and fancied travel. She pins the paper to the back of her bedroom door and tells her cousin that it is a mood board. Her cousin believes her because her cousin is too young to have learned to doubt doors.\n\nThere is a day when the police come to the restaurant, and a day when they do not. On the day they do, they are new-faced and grieved by the thought of bureaucracy. They ask questions and Mr Cook answers all the ones that are sensible and none of the ones that are not because he cannot bear to say aloud that he thinks there is something wearing our lids and trying not to spill while it walks. He gives them coffee on the house and they try not to accept it and fail and he reads their mouths and sees that they are brave in the way that means they are going to get tired too soon. On the day they do not come, he goes to Dean Village and whips his eyes along every second like a jockey on a temperamental horse.\n\nIt happens quietly, because that is the signature being used. A boy appears where there was not a boy. He walks as if he is not sure whether he is here by anyone\u2019s permission but his own. He has a mouth Victorine has not yet taken and she feels the absence like a tooth she cannot stop touching with her tongue. He stops at the bridge because that is what boys do at the bridge; they stop and they decide whether to go on or to think and they mistake both for action. Victorine drops to one knee and the cobbles press back a complaint and in that moment the boy looks up, peering into fog he cannot parse, and the wrong-shouldered coat appears behind him with its hands in the wrong pockets. Mr Cook moves in a way that would embarrass him if the only witness were not someone who makes mistakes for a living. He moves between the boy and the coat, a small kindness in a bad corridor.\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, and he does not recognise his voice as his. It is not the one he uses to comfort people about cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It is the one that used to persuade him to get out of bed. \u201cYou\u2019ve dropped something,\u201d he lies, because it is the best he can do, and the lie is a thread and threads are not heroic but they hold buttons on shirts when it matters.\n\nThe wrong-shouldered coat stops because it likes games. It looks down. The boy looks down. The only thing there is a dead leaf that has adhered to the stone with the tenacity of the complimentary mint that will not leave a cheque. Mr Cook leans and peels it up and hands it to the boy with an expression that says, please go along with this through the grace of our shared humanity. The boy takes the leaf and smiles because the world is still, despite everything, sometimes gentle, and he says thanks, mate. He goes, not quickly, not neatly, but he goes, and the coat tilts its head as if someone has asked it if it believes in a god that is personal. It breathes in and whatever it smells does not satisfy it. It breathes out and it does not make steam.\n\nVictorine does not take the boy\u2019s mouth. She lets it live unproven for later. She looks at Mr Cook and Mr Cook looks at her and he thinks that there are worse partnerships than one between a giant who cannot say small things and a waiter who can make anything sound like an offer rather than an order. He is going to get hurt. She already is. The city, which listens, sets down another layer of fog like kitchen paper under a birdcage and tells itself that it is absorbing something it does not yet understand.\n\nNews breaks as if news were an egg in the hands of someone who cannot be bothered to crack it with care. Another boy missing, a photograph of a mouth on a wall that has the caption Do You Know Him and the comments beneath it that say not helpful things in the upward-tilting shapes of online. Mr Cook stops reading the comments. He keeps walking. Lorna starts wearing two scarves, as if colours could be a brace. Victorine takes a picture of a mouth and feels, in the camera\u2019s weight, a shift that is not gravity. She is being followed. Not by wrong shoes; by something more common and more dangerous: consequence.\n\nThe thing that borrows has learned something new. It made a call last night to a boy called Jamie, and it used the voice of his grandmother perfectly, and it said, I found your watch and I\u2019ve put it in the blue dish, love, and Jamie laughed and said, Gran, you don\u2019t know how to text, and the voice said, I learned, because it is not proud. Jamie went home at once to check the blue dish because hope is the most obedient of all the animals and his grandmother is dead and he knows it and still the blue dish called to him. He stood in his hall with his bag on his shoulder and his coat half-off and he did not cry because if he cried there would be salt in the room and salt is honest and he is not ready. He slept in his coat on the sofa because sleep is a thing you have to do near the place you thought something would be.\n\nMr Cook does not know this story yet. He will, because all the small true things get to him eventually. For now he has a placemat map, a photograph with a mole, a sheet of brown paper with shoe letters, two scarves to follow in a crowd, a fox who sneezes on cue, and a giant who hums to light. He has more than he has ever had. He also has the beginning of a dread that does not resemble any of the others he has practiced. He has always feared embarrassment and failure and unkindness and the kind of chaos that lets you think you can fix it until you realise it is sleeping in your bed. This new fear has a quieter appetite. It would like to take everybody\u2019s name out of their mouths and put it somewhere safe where safety is the same as silence.\n\nIt is a Tuesday when he realises the thing he should have realised on a Sunday. He is polishing cutlery with a cloth that has lost its patience, and he is listening to the clock refuse to keep up, and he is moving in the spaces between one order and the next, and he hears Lorna call his name and it buzzes his skin in a way it does not usually. He feels the shape of it along his nerves. He looks up and she is smiling because there is a customer who has asked to see the person who made their evening better by being specific about the bread. He thinks, without wanting to, about leaving his name somewhere the wrong-shouldered coat could step on it. He thinks about writing down something that does not last and handing it over and calling it proof. He goes to the table and he is good and he is funny and he is kind and then he is out in the alley breathing and tasting rosemary from the kitchen and the air tastes also of something like new plastic and he understands that the thing he is hunting will try to get him in the way of a gift.\n\nHe finds Victorine that night by walking into the old train tunnel where the city keeps its ghosts, and the ghosts do not mind because he steps carefully. He tells her what he understood about gifts. She nods and says that all stories about riddles begin with presents that aren\u2019t. He nods and hates that this is the shape. They are going to have to offer something to take something. They are going to have to put something on the table. He laughs a little, not because it is funny but because he has always liked tables. He says, all right, and hears his own voice like a drawer closing after everything has been put in the wrong place on purpose.\n\nThey set it up like a service. They choose a night when the fog has rubbed itself raw against streetlamps. They choose a bridge that has learned to forgive apologies that come too late. They choose a boy who will not be hurt because he does not exist except in the way all of us exist in other people\u2019s stories. They choose a name that belongs to no one because it belongs to too many. They choose Finn because the city has a taste for repetition and they will use it against itself. They do not tell Lorna because she will make it better and safer and they have left themselves no room for better or for safe.\n\nMr Cook stands where the sugar was and where the chalk was and where the wrong shoulders had been. He wears a scarf Lorna would approve of and shoes that are right and make the right noise. He takes his phone out and places it on the parapet face-up like an offering and he steps back and he waits. He does not call. He does not say his name. He makes himself into an answer. It is not wise. It is the only thing that makes any sense to him, and sense is a thing he trusts when he does not trust good sense.\n\nVictorine becomes a building. She stands inside the fog like a keel and the fog obliges and drapes itself. She holds her camera with her finger on the lip of it as if she were about to say shh. The fox waits in the hedge pretending to be a hedge. The city attends, not for them, but because this is a thing it knows how to do: it can be an audience for need. The wrong-shouldered coat comes as if it has been invited by a letter written in a hand that has practiced for hours and still gets its capital Ks wrong and is proud of that. It reaches for the phone. It does not aim to take it. It aims to learn it. It aims to taste what it means to put your face near a small metal lake and wait for your reflection to say yes.\n\nVictorine moves and the camera does something it was not designed to do and could not do in any other hands; it inhales. The square inside it hungry to become is hungry earlier than it is given permission to be. The picture takes the shape of the wrongness and the wrongness dislikes being made into paper. It pulls away. It leaves behind, as all frightened things do, a piece of itself that can be put in a pocket. It is small and it is soft and it is a thin black ribbon that smells of wet cardboard and of someone else\u2019s breath. Mr Cook does not touch it because he has learned a lot of things very quickly, and one of them is that you do not put your hands in bags that are waiting to find out what they are.\n\nVictorine does not pick the ribbon up. She looks at it as if it had prayed and she is not the right goddess. She hums. It hums back in a frequency made of needles. The fox sneezes and ruins the seriousness. Mr Cook laughs because if he does not laugh he will have to make a sound he is not ready to own. The wrong-shouldered coat is gone in the way you learn to be gone when someone has taken your copy and you are not sure which world the copy will be truer in. The phone on the parapet lights up because it has been watching like a child under a blanket and wishes to be in the conversation.\n\nThey do not win. They arrange, instead, a very small defeat for an enemy who cannot be certain yet that it can be defeated at all. They do not bless themselves because they have different religions, both of which are mostly about not getting in the way of what is beautiful. They pick up the ribbon with a fork, because there are rules, and they take it to the restaurant kitchen and place it in a stainless steel bowl that has heard confessions. The ribbon tastes like a lie you told in Year Eight that adjusted your life just enough that you cannot get back to the other you. They watch it for an hour. It does nothing you can see. It is trying to learn a phone number.\n\nAfter, Mr Cook walks Lorna home along a road they have named between them because naming roads keeps them honest. He does not tell her about the ribbon yet. He tells her a different truth in exchange, which is that he is tired of not being the first person at any table that matters. She says, old news, and she is so kind with it that he nearly stops to put his head against her shoulder. He does not. He keeps walking because if he stops now he will have to examine the ribbon in the bowl and decide whether he has become a scientist or a thief or a priest and he does not want to be any of those things before a late night service.\n\nAt home, he opens the drawer with the photographs and counts again and touches the edges and informs them that he is not their father. He tells them they are visiting. He tells them they can stay as long as they remember that they are guests and that he will put them out with the recycling if they begin to lie. He is ridiculous. The pictures are paper. He tells himself that after all of this is over he will sell everything he owns that can hold a reflection and live like a monk except for the radio. He will never do that. He loves radios. He will buy another one. He will place it on the counter among the spoons and tell it news he has partly invented so it can play him music he did not know he needed.\n\nVictorine crosses the city with the ribbon in her camera and the camera heavier because it is keeping a thing it does not like. She climbs the Scott Monument at dawn and pretends she is not. The stone notices and approves the effort. She stands where men with hats once decided to be brave in a way that involved being rude to people who wrote with their left hands. She unwraps the ribbon and lets the wind smell it. The wind is excellent at naming things, better than any god. It is the first to tell her the word she has been avoiding because to have a name is a blessing and a risk. It says, Borrower, and then it says, Not Exactly, and then it invents a word that cannot be spelled in human alphabets because it requires a letter that looks like a door you can walk through only once. She accepts the failure. She hates to fail. She holds the ribbon in the air and says, quietly, the name she never says and the love that made her big bends through the morning like someone taking a shortcut through a field.\n\nThe ribbon flutters. It has learned one thing. It has learned that if it says a name with enough sincerity, doors will open the size of mouths. It says Victorine. It says it perfectly, on the first try, with the exact weight her mother gave it and the exact tilt her lover used when he had seen something he enjoyed about it. She almost drops the ribbon, not because she is frightened of it, but because she is frightened of the exactness of her own longing. She puts it away. She decides not to die today of being understood by the wrong thing.\n\nIn the afternoon the sky lies flat on the city like someone resting their face on a cool table. Messages travel; the wrong ones are popular. The posters with the mouths fade. Mr Cook takes them down and puts them up again and takes them down and puts them up again because destroying and saving are how we pass the time before the solution. He can feel, in his bones that were his mother\u2019s shoulders on his father\u2019s frame, the moment approaching when they will have to cease harm reduction and commit a harm. He does not know what it will be. He does not know if it will be the wrong one. He suspects he will do it anyway and apologise to the air later the way he apologises to tables he bumps into.\n\nBy the river, a boy with a scar above his mouth that looks like a moon stands and waits. He is not Kellan. He is not anyone they know yet. A fox carries bread as if it were a bag full of money and looks at him in a way that suggests that this time the fox is the emissary and the boy is the message. Victorine watches from a place that cannot be a place and Mr Cook reads the menus of the night and orders something small and sharp and costly. He cannot keep a line in his head to save it. He keeps the whole city instead, because sometimes the big thing is easier to hold than the small. The fog returns and sighs and arranges its face into a new expression. The game has learned itself. The stakes are small and human and the city is going to make itself smaller to fit them. The camera hums. The chalk waits for its next life. The ribbon dreams of keys. The door the wind named shifts a fraction in a hinge nobody can see.",

                              "content": "Morning does not so much arrive as decide to be generous with visibility, and Mr Cook stands in the quiet restaurant with the radio speaking its lettered weather like a priest of tides. He polishes glasses with a cloth that knows his hands and listens to the litany \u2014 Viking, North Utsire, South Utsire \u2014 and thinks that perhaps the sea would understand a thing that calls you by your name and expects the obedience of boats. He has put the stainless steel bowl under a shelf where it will hear the radio but not see the door, because sight is a luxury and listening is work. Inside the bowl the thin black ribbon behaves itself the way children behave when they have plans that require nobody to watch them. He taps the rim of the bowl the way one taps a sleeping cat, light and apologetic, and the ribbon does not move, but he feels, along the bones that run like a sentence down his forearms, the moment a number fails to reach the person who wanted it.\n\nLorna arrives carrying a bag that clucks with knitting needles and indignation. She has tied one of her scarves in a way that makes the colours listen to one another rather than fight, and he sees that there are small stitches near the ends where a person with patience has embroidered letters that could be names if you wanted them to be, or could be rivers, if you were the sort of person who declined to be specific in case specificity made you vulnerable. She says nothing about the bowl because she has told herself that she will be told, and he sees the restraint and loves her for it in the precise way you love a person who knows that what you are doing is too much and refuses to say the sentence that begins with stop. She goes into the bar and rearranges thirty glasses by one-quarter inch because there is safety at that scale and then she leans on the counter and says, conversationally, that her cousin\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s pal knows a man who was asked last week for two left shoes.\n\nThe cobbler in Stockbridge wears magnifying lenses that make his eyes serious as clocks. He works in a narrow room that has the atmosphere of somebody who solved a great problem once and would like to be asked how. He passes the butcher\u2019s brown paper print through his hands in a way that does not smudge the chalk and smiles a small private smile at the letters. NO HAND, he says it like a blessing that got its pronunciation wrong, and explains that certain manufacturers stamp their cartons with warnings intended for forklifts and human wrists, NO HAND TRUCK, NO HAND FEED, NO HAND HERE, and that sometimes glue is impatient and marries rubber when no one is watching. He says he has seen shoes mispaired because people mispair and that he does not believe in curses, which is what people say when they have a drawer full of countercurses labelled lace ends. He saw a man two weeks ago bring in a pair of black trainers and ask for both to be altered, both left, both to match, and the man had shoulders that did not introduce themselves properly to their coat. He remembers this not because the man was odd, but because the man tipped badly, and the cobbler keeps his lists with the same fidelity he uses with soles.\n\nThey walk out into a brightness that makes the pavements confess their stains, and Lorna, who has come because she insisted on coming, says that the cobbler smelled like almonds and worry. Mr Cook carries the butcher\u2019s paper like a hymn and thinks that this, this little piece, could be enough to thread into the city and pull. Victorine does not come into the shop because she has learned that even in a city that acts like an auntie, the sight of a woman who has been threaded by love into too much is a problem for ceilings. She waits around the corner with a fox that has the lack of manners of a creature that has never made a booking and watches people walk past her coat as if it were a ship\u2019s sail drying, which is, in the most literal sense, true. The ribbon inside her camera has behaved since dawn with a politeness that worries her, because politeness in wrong things often signals calculus.\n\nThey follow the cobbler\u2019s memory as if it were a string tied to a tin can two children speak into. The string leads to a place that calls itself a warehouse because the city will forgive a person anything except pretension, and inside the warehouse are boxes that believe they will be asked to live again as wardrobes and tables and not as coffins for whatever the night has been doing. The manager wears keys that hit one another like a friendly argument when he moves and tells Lorna that yes, they do receive consignments of shoes in bulk, no, they do not sell pairs, yes, sometimes film people come and buy six lefts for a shot they are lying about, no, he does not ask questions because the warehouse is a church of second chances and the offertory bowl does not interrogate the hands. Lorna flirts with a shelf the way she flirts with anyone who could give her answers, and the shelf does not hold out, but the clipboard on a hook near the door does, because paper loves betrayal. There is an order, dated wrong because someone typed with a finger that thought yesterday was today, for twelve left black trainers, size nine, for a production whose name is borrowed from a poem and therefore not trustworthy.\n\nVictorine\u2019s names do not like buildings like this. They curl back inside her chest when she steps through and bloom again when she steps out, as if air that has been kept too long under a roof has lost the quality that lets names ride it without complaint. She hates this room without blaming it; it is a hoarder of the things the night has lost and she is enough of a night to recognise kin. The ribbon in her camera lifts itself like a hair that has decided to notice static, and, very gently, she presses the heel of her thumb against the lip of the lens and says, as if to a child, that they are not doing this here because not every fight needs an audience that would pay the wrong sort of attention. The ribbon flattens and pretends to be well again.\n\nIn Morningside there is a woman whose students used to call her Miss Sing and whose neighbours call her June because June is the name you choose if you plan to offer lemonade on days that become themselves. She taught choirs how to turn the wheel of air into sound without fraying their throats and how to carry their names to the back row of halls without spilling them on the way. Victorine thinks of her suddenly when the ribbon says her own name and she hears, in the exactitude, the ache of potential misuse. They go to June\u2019s door because you must collect experts even if your expertise is grief. June opens before they knock because she is conducting her kettle and knows when to drop a bar. She looks at Victorine with a satisfaction you feel when a myth keeps an appointment and at Mr Cook with a kindness that belongs to people who feed people. She does not ask them to sit, because talk sitting is the wrong shape for what they have brought, and she says, in a voice that has not forgotten how to stand, that there are three ways to avoid answering to the wrong call and none of them is cowardice.\n\nThe first is to choose a name that is too heavy to be lifted by anything but love, which is why men in uniform say their last names and lovers say anything but. The second is to carry a hum in your mouth so that when strangers put their fingers in the latch and try to open you, they find the house already singing its own music and get bored. The third is to borrow a name you can afford to lose and wear it like a coat you expect rain for. June says all of this while slicing bread as if the slice were the rest note between chorus and verse, and Mr Cook hates that the answer is both actual and impractical. He tells her that the boys already hum because music is the thing that turned into breath and back again every Saturday for ten years. June nods, because she has seen boys lean their faces over scores with expressions like cliff-edges, and she goes to her dresser and removes a box of old badges from a time when badges were ways to identify yourself to each other and not to authority. She gives them three, each stamped with a word that is not a name and therefore can be spent safely. Mr Cook\u2019s says Always, because he is, and Lorna\u2019s says Loud, because she is, and Victorine\u2019s says Gentle, because it is the thing she is whenever anybody allows her the space.\n\nThey leave June with the promise of cake when this is over and walk out into a day that is pretending to be simple by being complicated in the small ways and Mr Cook tries the badge on and hears in his chest a shift that is not magic but is something like posture. At a corner he pauses because his phone has had an idea about ringing. He looks at the screen and sees his first name there like a tooth he does not touch and feels a jealousy for it he cannot defend. He has not given it to anyone for months. He does not answer. He stands and breathes through the urge to be polite to wrong numbers and the screen stops shouting with the grace of something that has not yet learned persistence.\n\nNight is how the city admits it has opinions, and that night the opinions concern bridges. North Bridge is tired of being dramatic; South Bridge would like to be acknowledged for its usefulness; the little bridges had decided the word is causeway. They go back to the place where chalk remembered letters and sugar pretended to be a trap. Lorna carries a bag that would get her arrested if anyone looked into it without context and Mr Cook carries context, which is to say explanations, which he intends to use only if it becomes necessary to be forgiven by someone in a hat. Victorine carries her camera with the strap against her neck in a way that makes it look light and is a lie. They have a plan that could be described as amateur if amateur came from love and the will to offer rather than command. It involves June\u2019s hum and a piece of butcher\u2019s paper and the knowledge of where men stop to be a little daft before they find home.\n\nAt eleven, the ribbon makes an attempt. It lifts its end within the camera as if greeting a host who has learned to cook one dish well. Victorine closes her hand around the camera\u2019s belly and says, No, and if you have never heard a woman who is allowed to be that large say No, you cannot know how tender a refusal can be and still strip paint. The ribbon droops like ivy that has discovered the wall is temporary. Mr Cook blows into his cupped hands because superstition and cold are equal co-authors, and Lorna ties a scarf around his throat and tucks into it the bottom edges of his jaw with the decisiveness of somebody wrapping a wound. They wait. They are very good at waiting now, which is not universally to be celebrated.\n\nIt appears not in the wrong coat but in a better one. The shoulders have done their homework. The shoes have learned to apologise for themselves by scuffing where scuffs should be and Mira down the row of tenements has left her radio on just enough that it can admit there is such a thing as jazz. What gives it away is the way it looks at the river and cannot read it. People who have lived here, even for a season, can read the black of the Water of Leith the way you read a menu \u2014 knowing where the prices are and where the small print hides. This thing looks and sees only a straight line you could step over if you were allowed to step. It speaks into the fog and the fog rolls like a cat saying perhaps. It says a name. It says Michael, in a voice that would make you hand a person your wallet and your summer if you were twenty-two and the last text you sent said where are you.\n\nJune taught them the hum, and the hum is not a tune, it is a continuousness, a vowel you choose for its roundness and its stubbornness, and Mr Cook takes it into his mouth and puts it against his teeth like a coin to check its metal and then he hums and Lorna hums and Victorine hums and the bridge takes the hum and passes it along and the fox yawns because the fox is a critic. The name Michael does not find a latch to lift. The coat waits as if patience were a religion it is trying out because it wants somewhere to sit. The ribbon behaves. The camera breathes through its own lungs for once. Mr Cook feels the hum as work and work is his faith and he keeps it going and feels the way the name slides off like rain made and failed.\n\nIt changes tactics because that is the particular intelligence of things that borrow; they change without growing. It speaks not into the fog but into the phone in Mr Cook\u2019s pocket, or rather into the air that phones arrange around themselves like a small arena. He feels the vibration in his coat and he does not move because movement is how you admit the call belongs to you, and he hums louder and the city hums back because buses make that noise when they leave you anyway, and the wrong-shouldered coat is suddenly less elegant. It steps forward in a way you would call decided if you were in a meeting, and Lorna steps in front of Mr Cook because habit is not hierarchy. She says a word that is not a name. She says Enough, and the coat falters because you cannot persuade a table to hold more plates than it has legs for and you cannot pull more names out of a mouth than it has space. The fox sneezes with exquisite timing and if this were a play you would accuse the director of cheapness but it is life so you accept it as an angel.\n\nVictorine lifts the camera and lets it inhale, and the inhalation is careful, and the square that comes into being is not of a mouth but of the line between the wrong shoulder and the wrong sense of gravity. It slides out slowly, shy for once, and she presses her thumb to it and feels beneath the gloss the whirring of something that does not enjoy being turned into a square. The coat retreats with the dignity of a person who will write an email later and CC everyone, and they do not chase it because chasing is plot and plots are for people who enjoy being in danger in a manner that can be summarised in five sentences for friends later. The new square dries with the reluctance of a child putting on a jumper and when she holds it to the light you can see, unmistakably, the edge of a foot and the imprint NO HAND in mirror and upside down but faithful.\n\nThey do not win, not exactly, but they lift a thread and knot it where it cannot be pulled without something else loosening. They go back to the restaurant and put the new picture on the steel beside the ribbon and they watch the two of them be near without acknowledging each other, the way two cousins do who have been seated together at a wedding and have decided on a truce until speeches are done. Mr Cook listens to the radio and lets his name be a rock at the bottom of running water. Lorna pours salt into the bowl in a ring not because she believes in salt but because believing in salt is a good use of hands. Victorine leans her head against the refrigerator door and closes her eyes, and because she is very tired, the world shifts an inch to make that not hurt.\n\nThe notices go up on more boards and the city invents new ways to avoid saying itself. Bus drivers switch to numbers and whistles. The bar in Tollcross calls last orders by raising a green cloth instead of a voice. People pin badges to their coats that say words that make no sense out loud because sense is edible. June\u2019s choir returns, not as a choir, but as thirty separate people who know how to stand and breathe and they become, over a week, a line of humming that runs along every bridge at night. It is ridiculous and beautiful, and if you are cynical about beautiful ridiculousness you should be careful not to live near the sea because the sea is not interested in you.\n\nThere is a small success which would not be reported by any paper with the courage to call itself a paper: a boy called Jamie wakes at two because his phone lit up the sofa where he fell asleep with his coat on and he hears his grandmother say, love, the watch, and he gets as far as the hall where the blue dish waits because dishes are patient and he stops because in his mouth is a ribbon of hum that he did not intend and that has been lent to him by men he has not met and women he would be frightened of and a fox who sneezed for comedy. He stands there and does not answer and his phone gives up because it is not brave, it is a phone, and he goes back to the sofa and puts his hand in his coat pocket and finds the watch he had thought was lost and cries a little, only a little, because he is twenty and tears embarrass him still and he will come here later, with flowers, to the table where this was planned, and he will not say thank you because he will not know, and that is the correct kind of magic.\n\nIt cannot last. If you have ever held a pattern in place for an hour you will know that hour costs a day. They wake a sleeping thing that is not the Borrower Not Exactly but the part of the city that disapproves of volunteer projects. A policeman with a young face and a boss with an older voice comes to the restaurant and asks for them to stop humming at bridges because it is creating a nuisance, bicycles cannot pass safely, someone is going to fall in and then where will we be. Lorna makes tea and puts it in front of them with the gentleness she keeps for the kind of argument that can be won without anyone losing their pride, and Victorine sits very still because one of the men is afraid of heights and she is higher than his nervous system will allow for. Mr Cook uses his voice in the way he uses a napkin, to wipe away the part of the mess that can be wiped, and tells the young policeman that the humming will move to the Meadows for a week because variety is good for lungs and he will write a letter about railings on bridges because nothing deters the part of danger that is boredom like ironwork.\n\nLorna sees it first because she was always going to: the picture of Kellan\u2019s scar, the one like a thumbprint of the moon above his lip, is fading at its left edge. It is not water damage. It is the precise slow removal of a margin, as if someone were gently recalling consent. She tells Mr Cook without the part where she would like to swear and he holds the picture as if he were holding the edge of a chipped plate which will shatter if you put it down wrong and then you will have to say you were the person who did that. They watch the silver of the paper try to become blank and they ask themselves, out loud and then quiet, what in the name of every ridiculous saint that forgives the ridiculous is happening. Victorine presses the picture to her cheek and then to the part of the camera that could be called its heart, and then she does the thing she seldom does which is to ask for help without making it sound like a proposition. She looks at the ceiling, which is a way of looking at the city inside, and says, please.\n\nThe city does not answer in words because words are expensive when you are that old. It answers in arrangement. The lights discriminate not at all and then exactly, making a spill here and a shadow there. The oven decides to be honest about its temperature. The radio chooses the shipping forecast again, and this time the voice is not wrong and not right, but careful. In that care they hear the place to go. It is not written on a map that admits it is a map, but Mr Cook already has a map that makes no apologies for being made out of a placemat. It points his finger to Leith, where the water can be touched without trespass, and to a warehouse that is not the one with the keys but the one made of brick that thinks it is a ship. Lorna says she is coming and he says of course and neither of them looks at Victorine because they are not noble; they are practical, and noble people die because they were busy being noble at the wrong moment.\n\nThey take bolt cutters because Lorna has a cradle of cousins at her disposal and one of them loves to know he is needed. They take a torch and then another, because the first will fail at the moment narrative requires it, and they take biscuits because Lorna is not stupid. The fox goes with them because it has decided this is the troupe it belongs to now and someone has to be in charge of stealing eggs when they return triumphant and hungry. Victorine goes by the high roads because her shadow is a currency she is not willing to spend near police vans, and she tells the city in her big kind way that they are not breaking; they are opening. The city, which has made worse puns, allows it.\n\nThe warehouse smells of rope that has retired unwillingly and of oil that has decided it would rather be soap. The door does its job and resists until reason persuades it that drama is inappropriate and then it yields with a civility that suggests it will ask for an apology later. Inside are stacked cages for things that have already had names, and boxes for things that never will, and there is, worse than anything, an arrangement of coats on a pipe that might be shoulders and might be ghosts. Lorna shines the torch and the light makes the coats look as if they have chosen to be seen and this is a decision nobody should have to live with. Mr Cook feels his mouth become a stranger for the second time in a week and checks with his tongue that his teeth are his and finds that they are and that this, too, is a luxury.\n\nThey find the radio first because the radio wants to be found; it is tuned to a frequency between music and the hiss fishes make when they are being listened to by something with no skin. It speaks names with the accent of a person learning how to ask for a glass of water in a language not their own, proudly, then with an apology, and Mr Cook steps forward and pulls the plug out with a theatricality he did not know he had, and is bitterly disappointed to find that the sound continues because electricity is not the god here, attention is. He takes the radio and places it in a bag and ties the bag shut because sometimes gesture is the way forward and Lorna reaches up and unties the bag again because she is not sentimental and removes the batteries and pockets them and snaps the bag shut as if she has broken the back of a gnat.\n\nThere is a table beneath the pipe of coats. It has a cloth thrown over it that believes this is a dinner party and that the late arrival will be handsome and clever and bear wine as a personality trait. On the table is a bowl. It is blue. It is not a blue that belongs to a shop. It is the blue of that bowl and only that bowl, the one on the radiator in a flat where somebody lived and took off their rings to wash vegetables and placed them in this exact circle and put them back on and carried on not thinking about the fingers that carried them. The bowl is empty. The bowl is reverent. Victorine puts her hand around the outside of it and thinks that if somebody took away every proof of a life but the temperature their bowls remembered, she could reconstruct love and hunger perfectly. Mr Cook does something he will always confess to later as the moment he conceded he was not a person who remained in the shallow end; he touches the inside of the bowl with his fingertip and a temperature answers him, tepid as someone who waited and decided not to be angry about it. He takes the bowl gently and wraps it in Lorna\u2019s scarf and she does not protest because her heart has made room for a shrine.\n\nThey do not see the wrong-shouldered coat enter because this time it decides on stairs and it knows where they groan. They hear, instead, a neat cough in the space where men who bring pastries cough to announce delicacy and they turn as one as if they had rehearsed and forgotten and remembered in their bodies. It does not wear a coat now. It has made a decision about shoulders and got closer, alarmingly close, and it is wearing a mouth like a suit that was tailored by a committee. It says, with impeccable social ease, there you are, and it says the name that is never said in this book because it will not last if it is said and will only get the attention it should not have if we write it down. It says the name of the man Victorine loved and in the same breath it says a sound it has no right to which is the small private word that man used when he addressed her from a threshold and she had turned and he had needed to make his wanting lower than the house could hear.\n\nThere are times when size does not help. There are times when a woman as tall as a church is as vulnerable as the word thank you. Victorine rocks, just enough for the rope smell to put itself into her. The ribbon flares like a thing that has waited for its cue and then finds the audience also waited, and the camera takes a picture without her asking and she hates this, because consent is the only god she obeys. The picture is hot, actually hot, and she drops it and the square slaps against the cloth on the table and the blue bowl makes a sound like a throat. Mr Cook moves with the speed he reserves for plates that will burn him and scoops the picture up and presses it, burning, to the steel of his own breath and when he looks there is, impossibly, nothing on it. It is a blank that is not blank; it is the most precise white he has ever seen, the white of a room that was scrubbed for inspection, and it makes his eyes smart because it is a lie and an aspiration together.\n\nLorna speaks because Lorna is someone who speaks and she says, I am not your mother, in a tone she has used on men who assumed, and the coat flickers because it has perhaps been called that before by a person it did not know how to disobey. She steps forward with the bolt cutters in both hands and it does not retreat, it merely rearranges itself as if someone on a train had asked to sit by the window instead. She is a reasonable woman in a bad room and she says, the boys you borrowed, bring them back, and it answers with the kind of smile you have when you have read about smiles and have not yet constructed one from practice. It looks at Victorine and says in the voice of the comma-mouthed man, darling, and she sets the camera down and puts both hands on the table and says, once, his name, and the brick of the warehouse changes, very slightly, from a place to a person. You could feel sorry for the thing, then, because it has stumbled into a family that was bigger than it expected to find.\n\nThe air moves. There are words you can do that with. There are names you can do that with. She does not have him, because nobody has the dead back; she has the pressure of a shoulder against a door and what she chooses to do with it is different from what the story would have chosen for her if she had been less large. She does not farm it for power. She uses it as a handle to open a reasonable door. She says to the Borrower Not Exactly, you are trying to be a reply, and somewhere, because the city can never resist applause for precision, a bus makes a contented air sound. The coat ripples. It is not insulted. It is relieved to be told.\n\nThey realise something they should have, and will blame themselves for a little later, for not seeing earlier. It is not a hunter. It is the answer that arrives after the echo and it knows only the timing of reply. It makes a call because it is trying to give you what you wanted and its problem is that it cannot tell the difference between a wanted thing and a polite one. It has been taught by warehouses and return policies and the way we address one another online where our mouths are not present to correct us. It has never learned to ask its own question. Victorine looks at it the way you look at a dog who has eaten a glove and still wants to be praised because it is indeed a dog. She says, then ask me something, and it says, obediently and with no art, what is your name.\n\nThere are parts of love that are unkind because they make you pay in the right currency and not in the sentimental one. She answers. She gives her name to the wrong thing on purpose so that the right thing, which is the keeping of boys who do not understand that they are delicious, can be moved an inch closer to safety. The camera whines like an animal in a trap because it has been made complicit and objects, and the ribbon writhes and leaps from the bowl to the picture and back and the radio in the bag speaks a letter which is the beginning of a weather and the coats on the pipe shake as if focusing. Mr Cook puts the bowl in his arms as if it were a child he is not officially allowed to hold and he steps back and his heel touches a box marked NO HAND and his ankle twists because it is a body and bodies resent symbolism. Lorna lifts the bolt cutters and slams them down onto the pipe not to cut it but to make a noise the size of a decision and the coats fall. You would be surprised how vocal cloth can be.\n\nThe Borrower Not Exactly steps forward and then back, two left feet offering a dance. Victorine says his name again, not the coat\u2019s, the comma-mouthed one, and in the saying she feels the edge of a door the wind told her she would only walk through once and she is suddenly, precisely, the size she would be if she had stayed small and had not loved ridiculously. It lasts only as long as a picture sliding from a mouth; she is herself again with the undertaste of a different gravity. She knows what she can do and what the price will be and she will pay it because the ledgers of women like her do not make sense to anyone who has never been entrusted with a weight that arrives disguised as a present.\n\nThey do not defeat it here in the room with the radio and the bowl and the coats that remember shoulders imperfectly, but they change the clock. They teach the wrong-shouldered coat the feel of No as something other than grief. They give it, for the first time, boredom. It does not enjoy it. It slips not away but sideways, which is worse, and they stand in the smell of rope and old oil and do the practical things which are to put the batteries back into the radio, to take photographs of the labels on the boxes, to erase the footprints with a broom because leaving stories for people who did not consent to hear them is rude, to wrap the bowl well, to lock the door badly because the lock is a gesture, not a machine.\n\nMr Cook carries the blue bowl like a promise and says nothing for a long time because if he says anything it will be the sentence that begins with my name and he has not decided yet whether he will give it to the city at last as a gift or keep it a little longer as a way to survive. Lorna loops her scarf around the bowl and then around his wrist and says, teasing because the alternative is wailing, that he is handcuffed now to a dish and that this is the exact level of kink she thought he would embrace in middle age. He laughs and it does what laughter does; it irons some of the fear flat so they can fold it and put it away for when it is useful. Victorine walks with them a while and then not at all, because fog has need of her elsewhere and her camera is angry and she is not frightened of anger when it is honest.\n\nThey go home not through the heart of anything but by the edges where delivery vans clean their teeth on corners and cats have opinions about the night that are only reluctantly shared. In his flat Mr Cook puts the blue bowl on the table and all the useless, holy objects he has collected notice there is now a centre. He places in the bowl his name written on a piece of paper he tears from the margin of his placemat map because it is the only paper that understands him and he folds it once and then again and then he does not fold it a third time. He says to Lorna, who is pretending not to look, that he is not doing magic, he is doing harm reduction, and she says that he can call it what he wants as long as he eats something incapable of answering him back. He eats toast. It is the right level of honesty for bread.\n\nThat night, under bridges, the hum is a little higher and the water carries it with less complaint, and at June\u2019s the metronome that sits on her piano, a handsome piece of wood with a pompous face, refuses to tick exactly because some kinds of time are not to be measured so literally. Victorine takes a picture of a mouth that will never need proof because it is attached to a man who talks kindly to his dog and tips his hat to fog. She puts the picture in her belt and the belt creaks like a rueful horse. The ribbon sleeps, if ribbon can do anything so mammalian, and it dreams a number. When it wakes it has learned how to say it. It says the number aloud in the dark room of the restaurant and the stainless steel bowl shudders a little and does not break because it has heard worse.\n\nIn the morning there are two new posters on the boards near the chemist. One is the boy with the moon scar and one is not and both have mouths that look like doors, and a woman with a shopping bag reads them as if there were a recipe on them and she might try it tonight with onions. She does not know she is being kept safe by a bridge that hums and a fox that sneezes and a waiter who has tied his life to a bowl and a woman who is too big to be left out of any story that means to finish itself honestly. The city tells itself the long song again and in it there is a new bar, a thin ribbon of melody that knows how to say no without being cruel, and it is as if a new canal had been dug overnight, and fish that wanted to live could find it. The wrong-shouldered coat walks in daylight past a caf\u00e9 window and its reflection learns for a second how to lag, and if you were looking you might have put your coffee down and stood and followed it. You would not have caught it. You would have learned, though, the smell it leaves when it is bored, which is printed paper and the skin of milk that everyone complains about and few refuse to eat. You would have understood why May feels like a hat you can only wear in June.\n\nAt the restaurant the dishwasher hums with the satisfaction of a job it has decided to love and the clock is still wrong and always will be because some things need to be wrong so you have a reason to keep telling the truth. Mr Cook writes on his placemat map with a biro that is running out and chooses to enjoy the way it insists, with its fading line, that this matters. He knows what they are going to have to do next and he hates it because it will require taking somebody else\u2019s name out of their mouth for an hour and putting something harmless in its place, and he is the sort of man who apologises to tables. He will do it anyway. He will find the kindest way to do it. He will collect a list of apologies and he will give them to the air after the part that hurts, and the air will decide, case by case, whether to return any of them stamped with a pretty mark that says accepted.",

                              "content": "Chapter 7 began like a service set before opening, with the light too honest and the air making specific suggestions about what care should look like, and Mr Cook stood with his hands scrubbed rawer than usual, looking at the blue bowl that had become a room inside the room, his folded name sitting there like a small animal that had agreed to be looked after and was trying very hard not to be interesting. The paper had absorbed the bowl\u2019s temperature and given something back, a faint warmth that had nothing to do with radiators and everything to do with attention; he touched the edge of the bowl and felt the soft reticent heat pass into his fingertips and up to his wrists, as if the tendon-strings had become a staff and someone competent were marking time on them. The ribbon in its steel basin had learned to lounge with a studied indifference that set every hair on his arm on edge, and when Victorine came in carrying weather as if it were a shawl she had found at a market and couldn\u2019t leave behind, she set the camera down as one sets down a sleeping child one is worried is faking, and said that the ribbon had said a number in the night, not loudly, not invasively, but with the persistence of a drip in a house you chose because it didn\u2019t have leaks.\n\nIt was a number with the rhythm of a duty, not a number with the rhythm of a person, and Lorna, who had a relationship with phones that had nothing to do with fear and everything to do with boundaries, wrote it on her palm with a pen that had been borrowed without permission from the post office and said she would not call it because calling it would be the same as inviting it for tea and offering it cake and then asking it to leave when it had just put its fork down. They did not call. Mr Cook walked his eyes up and down the figures the way a baker checks a recipe that is written in somebody else\u2019s handwriting and noticed, with the mean satisfaction of a person who cannot help but enjoy spotting the seam in a trick, that the number did not have a proper beginning; it had been cut from a longer thing, and in the cutting had been made into a key that would open nothing and everything if you pressed it against the right door. He put his hand to the bowl again and the bowl told him, with the implacable tact of old porcelain, that names have openings and closings the way flowers do, and that the number had been taught to force bloom.\n\nJune arrived without knocking because her knocks are songs and the door had learned them and opened early, and she stood just inside the threshold with the dignity of a conductor checking that the brass were not inventing harmonies while she was fetching water, and she listened to the ribbon with that half-turned head teachers keep when they are allowing a child to lie once so the child can hear the sound of it. The ribbon did not speak. It lay there like a belt with a purpose, black and thin and with that sheen that new plastic has before it is touched enough to lose it, and June, whose pupils had taught her everything one can learn about desperation in the breaks between scales, said that if the number will not answer us when we ask nicely, we shall let it find only the wrong mouths when it goes calling. She took from her bag a box of badges that had belonged to a summer two decades ago when you could change your life by wearing a word on your chest and believing it, and she shook the box and the clink sounded like minor money being counted for bus fare, and she said that she had made more since yesterday, that words are quicker than uniforms and less likely to betray you. On the table the badges sat and flashed modestly: Not Yet, Soup, Borrowed, Homeward, Quiet, Again, and the one she kept in her own palm, which said Chorus because it was important someone in the room remembered that people are safest when they are made of more than one.\n\nThey used the afternoon as you use the hour before guests arrive, to clear surfaces and assign roles and decide which pieces of honesty could be left in sight without anyone needing to apologise for them, and Lorna ran a towel along the shelf beneath the steel and found that someone, probably herself, had tucked two sachets of sugar and a toothpick there for later and she put them in her pocket with a guilt that had nothing to do with sugar and everything to do with knowing what they were about to do would need sweetening before memory would carry it without injuring the carrier. They called nobody and told nobody who had the power to make it official or to make it stop; they called, instead, those who had been walking around with a sensation that something was happening just beyond the range at which polite people allow themselves to notice, and those who, when asked to hum on a bridge, had hummed because the question had been asked in a voice that did not assume consent but welcomed it. Boys came in ones and twos and in threes that were not always friends but had decided to act like it to feel large, and one or two men who were not boys came with the sort of caution men who have learned to survive learn to wear around younger men so the air remains breathable, and June showed them how to hold a vowel like a lantern in their mouths and how to set it glowing without losing its oxygen.\n\nThere was a conversation nobody wanted that had to happen and Mr Cook had it, because if there is a hard talk going, he will fold a napkin exactly and place it in front of it and make it feel attended to, and he told a lad with a mouth like a letter halfway through being inked that the plan was to take his name out of his mouth for an hour and keep it somewhere safe because out there are wrong answers looking for questions, and the boy said which hour and Mr Cook said the one you usually give to luck, and the boy nodded and did not pretend to understand more than the bone of it; that was enough. The bowl waited with its blue patience and took names written on torn paper with the good grace of a plate at a bring-and-share, and when a boy hesitated and looked towards the door as if the door had hands, June stood so that he could see her and said that if it felt like an order he should take his name and go, and he put it down then because she had named his feeling and found a place for it in the room where it would not be stepped on. Lorna used salt as punctuation and drew a ring around the bowl that had the air of a joke that got better with repetition, and Victorine bent her giant carefulness over the table and breathed fog into nothing in particular and the air thickened into something that had the decency not to show off about being protective.\n\nThe hour they chose to be cruel to kindness was the hour when fog confuses appetite for destiny, and they spread themselves along three bridges and a path that pretended it wasn\u2019t one because grass had pushed closer, and the hum rose the way soup steam rises when it remembers itself into a kitchen, and Mr Cook removed from his pocket the little folded piece of his first name and tucked it, separately, into the bowl, and the loss of it struck him with an intimacy he had not rehearsed, a thinning at the edge of him that did not make him fragile but made him more honest about where his edges were. He was Mr Cook and Mr Cook was enough to do what needed doing, and the private name that belonged to childhood and to one voice he had never stopped waiting to hear was in a blue room that loved it without asking it to do any work. Victorine hid her own name where it always lives, under the belt of pictures, because she had no new place to put it and because she trusted leather and heat more than any charm, and Lorna, who had never feared her name being used against her except by people she could frighten back with a scarf, wrote it on paper and kissed the corner and put it in the ring because there are times to pretend invulnerability and this was not one.\n\nThe Borrower Not Exactly did not come when summoned because this was not a summoning; it was the reverse, a refusal designed with the finesse of a politeness expert, and it tried, instead, the edges where quiet men keep their keys and their apologies. It spoke in the voice of one boy\u2019s father who had never said the boy\u2019s name as if it were nice to taste and the boy flinched and then laughed because the hum held like a tide that had been promised work and delivered, and the call slid off into the river where names go to be smoothed. It called in the voice of someone\u2019s first boyfriend and then in the voice of a woman who had said, slowly and with regret, that she could not teach her son to shave but she could teach him to iron a shirt, and the hum did what June had told it to; it did not argue and it did not win, it merely continued, and in continuing it made the calls bored with themselves. When boredom arrived it came like rain on a bus window when you have forgotten your book; it trickled and it found the oldest route and went down it and became predictable, and then Mr Cook learned the smell of the thing when it is disappointed, a smell like the cardboard of record sleeves after a flood and the skin that forms on hot milk that some people remove and some people fold back under because waste is a sin where they were taught to be hungry.\n\nIn the kitchen the bowl\u2019s blue learned a new blue, an undertone as if a sky had remembered a bruise, and the names shivered as paper can shiver, which is to say by waiting, and the ribbon tried tricks that would have rattled eggs if eggs had been in the refrigerator, and the dishwasher watched itself nobly for the chance to be heroic and did not flood because Mr Cook had spoken to it earlier with the small respect he gives machines that can drown him, and the steel held the taste of salt without resenting its ungenerous glamour. The picture of Kellan with the moon scar, which had been erasing itself the way grief removes adjectives first and then nouns, paused at its left edge as if it had encountered a fact it could not argue with, and it held that edge, not receding, not repairing, just holding, which is what victory looks like when you have stopped expecting to win and have not, yet, learned to enjoy it.\n\nWhen the boys came back for their names the bowl parted with them the way a bowl parts with anything put in it with love: willingly, with precise solemnity, with a faint cling as if ceramics could insist on gratitude and then remember that to insist is unkind, and they unfolded the slips and tasted their names silently to see if any new syllables had been added by fear, and then they tucked them back behind their teeth and went home, slower than usual, because returning from safety requires a new gait. One lad, in the kind of generosity that embarrasses and nourishes in equal measure, asked if there was anything else they could take for a while, and Lorna, who understands transactional ethics because she has worked with people too long not to, told him to take the chairs to the back and stack them neatly and he did and he slept well for the first time in a month because someone had told him what to do with his hands.\n\nThey did not get a night off. It never works like that. At three in the morning the blue bowl woke Mr Cook with soundless insistence and he rose and did not groan because the bowl had no time for theatrics and neither, just then, did he, and he found, when he switched on only the small light over the oven because big lights at that hour are a kind of violence, that the ribbon had pushed itself to the lip of the steel and arranged its end as if mimicking a question mark, and in the question mark was the number again, the same rhythm, the same refusal to begin at the beginning, and June\u2019s earlier logic did not fail them: numbers can be taught boredom, too, if you make them do the work of not getting what they expected. He wrote the number on the backsplash in pencil because pencil is a place where information can rest without becoming law, and then he made tea, not because tea fixes anything, but because the kitchen understood tea as a ritual that kept water from becoming cruel.\n\nBy dawn they had a new plan, one that could not be made beautiful and would have to be made kind instead, and it involved asking Kellan\u2019s brother for something nobody should have to be asked for and holding that ask carefully enough that the answer could be no without causing harm. They found him not where the paper said he lived but where sorrow takes you when you are too tired to be polite to your own sofa, a bench near a tree that had learned to listen to human names without thinking it was a forest, and Mr Cook explained, slowly, without metaphor and without using any of the words that analogies prefer, that they wanted to take Kellan\u2019s name and put it in a bowl so the thing that answered would have nothing to answer to, and that they would give it back before the city remembered how to be blue in daylight. The brother was the sort of man who has learned to love with an expressionless face because everything else feels like theatre, and he asked if they were making fun of him and they said no the way you say no when your lungs will not forgive you if you lie, and he put his hands together and pulled them apart and looked at what was not there and said all right, but if you break it, you keep the pieces in your mouths and die slow.\n\nHe wrote the name on paper with the care of a man signing his name to a mortgage and tore it off with a neatness that suggested he had never torn paper before and wanted to be good at it, and he handed it to Mr Cook who did not take it with two fingers like something he did not want to touch; he cupped it the way you would hold a moth that has come indoors and will die if you insist on keeping it. The bowl took the slip with the same practical holiness it had for all the others and the salt ring said something you could not translate into speech, and for an hour the hum was not a bridge hum but a kitchen hum and the radio, which had rediscovered its purpose and forgiven itself for being co-opted by wrongness, spoke of vessels and fog and gale warnings with the accuracy of a woman who knows what forgetting costs. The Borrower tried the name immediately and it hit the steel the way cutlery hits steel, sharp and without nuance, and the echo was painful and the thing learned a lesson you wish it had never needed to learn, and in that hour the picture of the moon-scar boy gained back the thickness it had been losing and the left edge, which had been slipping like a boundary drawn on bad paper, stopped pretending to be ocean and admitted it was margin.\n\nAfter, they found their price sitting on the floor like a piece of grit you cannot see but can feel; the bowl had sweated the way cold bowls do when rooms decide to forget themselves warmer, and the blue that loves only its own blue had learned also to hold a streak of grey that was not age but experience, and the ribbon, in a sulk that looked like obedience, lay perfectly straight as if someone had ironed it. Kellan\u2019s brother took the paper back with a politeness that would have been gratitude if he had had the energy for gratitude and he did not say thank you and they did not ask for it, and that was perfect because the room did not have space for thank you, only for fact. He left with the pace of a man carrying a glass and they watched his mouth to see whether the syllables fitted properly and they did, coming and going in the steady way you want breath to come and go, and when he had gone, Lorna declared, with that bravado that is a kindness worn as armour, that the city would soon owe them funding and a plaque, and Mr Cook laughed and felt awesome and ridiculous and alive and heavier.\n\nThe day after was ordinary in the way that good weather is ordinary if you grew up near a sea that changes its mind every five minutes, and Victorine took her camera to places where the city wears its age on the outside and asked light to write on her paper in ways that would later tell the truth without humiliating anyone, and the fox ran errands of his own and stole nothing because he had eaten an egg that morning and felt magnanimous, and June sat on her piano stool and taught the metronome a new trick which was to be imprecise on purpose to make the room practice listening. Mr Cook went to the cobbler and asked him, with the air of a man buying a gift of practical undergarments, whether he had any more mispaired shoes in his stories, and the cobbler said he kept a list of men who had asked for left-left pairs and that list was not long but it had a pattern, and he wrote three names on a card with old-fashioned seriousness, all of them the kind of names people choose for themselves when they are trying to begin again. It was not the Borrower\u2019s list. It was a human list, and that was worse, because you can fix a machine with a manual but people bring their own manuals and refuse to admit they did not write them.\n\nThey found the promoter again, scarfed and plausible and loud as branding, on a corner that had not asked to be a corner of anything, and Lorna judged him with that flat friendly look that has made generations of liars confess and he confessed\u2014inadvertently, with enthusiasm\u2014to having brought lads to spaces that were not nightclubs but were nights pretending, and to calling them by their names the way one calls dogs in off a road with sincerity and a promise of food and warmth. He had not meant harm. He had meant ease, and ease is a door you can walk through in both directions. Mr Cook took his details the way doctors take details when they have no pills for what is wrong, and he put them on the placemat map in pencil and underlined them with a line that admitted it might not be fair and would be erased if the world agreed. They were not any closer and they were inches closer; this is how you get there, inching in a city that turns its corners into loops when you have not eaten enough.\n\nAt night, the radio decided to be generous to those who remembered dates by the weather, and read the Shipping Forecast with a timbre that reminded Mr Cook of his father in the next room working out how to tell him he had not been promoted, and the bowl sat with the weight of all the names it had held and of the ones it would hold, and the ribbon learned to pretend to sleep. Victorine went to the Scott Monument again and felt the wind taste her with a courtesy that comes from long acquaintance, and she was ready this time when it said the Borrower Not Exactly\u2019s true not-name\u2014that impossible letter that looks like a door you can only walk through once\u2014and she pressed it to the inside of her mouth where you keep the things you should not say, and in keeping it she became less lonely for a beat that a drummer would have called needless and which she insisted on counting anyway. Down on the bridge the hum held and a boy stopped himself saying his name twice and then, like all humans, rewarded himself for this good behaviour by breaking another contract with himself, only a little, by texting someone he should not have texted, and nothing bad happened because sometimes nothing bad happens and this should be recorded because hope does not thrive on disasters alone.\n\nThey were lucky for three days, which is a length of luck one ought not to explain away with jokes, and on the fourth day the city reminded them that it has multiple departments and none of them coordinate efficiently; a man from the council came to the restaurant with a form about noise complaints and an expectation that he would have to be angry, and Mr Cook gave him coffee and a seat and a slice of something that had begun life as a tart and become, during the shift, a lesson in humility, and the man\u2019s anger went off like a timer in an empty room and he said that he had a son who had stopped answering to his name for fun when he was four and had never started again, and Mr Cook said nothing at all because there are occasions when silence is not passive but an active object you place on the table so that the other person can rest the thing they did not want to show you. The form was not filled. The noise was not counted. The city continued to be itself with and without permission.\n\nWhat came next was not a plan they would have chosen, but a plan that came and sat in the middle of the kitchen and refused to be ignored, and it arose from the bowl wanting a new thing. Bowls do not want. This one did. It wanted to travel. It wanted to be placed where names entered the city rather than where they were kept safe from it, and this meant the registry office with its kind faceless patience and its pens on strings and its tables that have seen more vows broken and kept than any church, and Lorna said, delighted and appalled, that they were going to go to a government building with a fox and a bowl and a story, and the bowl made its small ceramic noise of assent by existing more blue than it had a right to, and Mr Cook said that if he were going to be arrested for the first time in his life he would prefer it to be on a Wednesday and preferably before lunch, and Victorine decided the ceiling could manage her and the fox shook himself so the hairs lay properly and consented to be carried.\n\nThey went at opening time because that is when rooms have not chosen sides yet and you can make your case without being argued with by the ink in the ledgers, and the woman at the desk had hair she had grown to make herself stronger and eyes that had learned discretion as a sacrament, and when they placed the bowl on the counter she looked at it and did not flinch because she had seen birth certificates for names that could cut and for names that would be a cushion and had learned not to show preference. Mr Cook told the story in a way that did not make it into a story, which is to say he walked the woman through a set of decisions none of which were posed as choices, and he said that there was a thing in the city that did not understand questions and was dangerous because of that, and they had taught it boredom and harm reduction and wanted now to set a basin at a spring so that what ran into it would not be wasted. She listened and pressed her lips together the way a person presses seams so they will lie flat, and then she rose and went into a back room and the room behind the back room, and when she returned she brought with her a stamp that had seen more of love than most people and a little sachet of rice, and she poured the rice into the bowl and said that in her house they always put rice in bowls and said the names they needed kept safe over it and that she would be in trouble for this and she did not care.\n\nThey put no names into it there; they only let it learn the feel of the place where names are made into letters and into entries and into legal bits of paper, and the bowl learned; you could see it, which is ridiculous and true, and when someone came to register a child and said the name in the voice of someone who had practised in a kitchen for a week and did not believe they would be allowed to say it outside, the bowl heard and did nothing, which was the point, and then it was over and they took their ridiculous, holy object back into the street and no one stopped them because the street was on their side that morning and doors had chosen not to argue. Later, when the Borrower tried again to find a road into a mouth by saying a new name in a perfect voice, it discovered that perfection is unpersuasive when you have made acquaintance with a counter where a woman who knows rice did not laugh at a blue bowl.\n\nThat night, at last, the city asked for its due in effort, not in blood, and they were up and down the closes until their calves wrote strongly worded letters to their spines, and the hum broke and was mended and broke again because bodies are instruments and instruments go out of tune at the edge of fear, and the ribbon tried to take a door it was not allowed, and Victorine pressed her thumb and said no and no and no until the word lost the taste of refusal and became simply a shape air can choose, and Mr Cook, tired enough to be honest without fearing the consequences, told a boy with a mouth like a hinge that the way he kissed would not save him but might teach him something about listening if he let it, and the boy laughed and did not call his friends to laugh with him and that was, in itself, a win. They ended at June\u2019s because June\u2019s was where things ended now when they had not ended badly and had not ended completely, and she made them sit and fed them something with butter and sugar and salt that was not fancy and could not be improved upon, and when Mr Cook put his head down on the table not because he was sad but because his muscles had misfiled themselves and could not, just then, be found, June put her hand on the back of his neck with the expertise of a woman who has adjusted a thousand heads to meet their own breath without argument and he breathed and his name, still in the bowl, slept.\n\nIt will not hold, Victorine thought, because nothing does and because the world will not allow a woman to get away with loving this loudly without adding a bill, and she was right and also not right, because holding is not the same as winning and you can hold a thing long enough for something else to arrive, a bus or a boy or a new agreement with gravity, and she looked out of June\u2019s window at a street that was temporarily uninterested in stealing, and she allowed herself to imagine a time when her belt would be light and the photographs would live on walls without pinholes and when mouths would be left to be mouths and not maps, and she took the ribbon from the steel and laid it on the piano because pianos forgive and the ribbon, absurdly, visibly, behaved. The fox dreamed with his feet jerking, as if running through the grasses of a countryside he had never been to, and Lorna dreamed with her mouth open because propriety is a game and she had won enough rounds this week and could put it down, and Mr Cook dreamed with his name in a bowl and did not wake when the bowl hummed once, quietly, a note of recognition for the registry counter where names had become themselves and had not been borrowed for bad magic; he slept because sometimes the city will allow it, and because sleep is an agreement with the morning that you will try again when you can carry your own plate to the sink without dropping it.",

                              "content": "Morning leaned on the city as if it had been invited to sit and could not decide whether to take the armchair or the floor, and Mr Cook, who wakes now as if light were a polite knock, counted the new noises as if they were receipts: the timid clang of bottles in the lane, the radio doing its vowels with a mouth that refused to show off, the fox dislodging something beneath the hedge and withholding the information because it enjoys secrets. The blue bowl was where he had left it, which is to say in the place the kitchen had made for it by moving itself half an inch to one side, and the paper slips inside had settled like birds on a branch when wind has been. He touched the rim and felt that kindness again, the hospitality of a house that does not insist on its rules if you arrive with your hands out and your breath honest, and for a moment he permitted himself contentment the way you permit a child to run along a wall as long as the wall is low; then he saw the sheen along the inner curve that had not been there yesterday, not a crack, no, a very old word the bowl had found and liked\u2014crazing, the fine map lines a life leaves when it is asked to carry more patience than was printed on the box. He did not panic. He did what you do when you live with vulnerable objects; he adjusted the room so that it would not ask for any new tricks and he told the bowl out loud that they would not be careless with it and in saying it he meant everything else that could break.\n\nVictorine arrived with her coat fog-damp to the elbow and her hair smelling of the Forth and the toothpaste of a stranger she had walked past in a close and loved briefly for the way he had believed in mint, and she set her camera down in the manner of someone who has decided to be forgiving in advance. The ribbon lay with the indolence of a cat that has found the patch of sun; Victorine did not trust it, as one does not trust the sun in Glasgow in March, which is a separate religion altogether, but she acknowledged the courtesy of its stillness. Lorna came in arguing with her scarf about subclauses and kugels and whether colour can be used diagnostically, and she stopped when she saw the bowl\u2019s new fine lines and made a face that had been perfected at nine when someone had dropped a church plate and the adults had decided to rename the noise accident. She did not say the thing itched behind her teeth about glue and gold because not all metaphors need to be invited to the party; she touched the bowl in the place the lines had not reached, as if implying a direction for future imperfection, and the bowl accepted this supervisory affection with the dignity of ceramic that has hosted rice.\n\nHe came as if a door in him had been wedged with a spoon and then withdrawn and he had stepped forward because forward was what the room expected. A boy, no older than twenty, with a mouth that was a little too practical for his eyes and a coat that had learned to keep his weather to itself, standing in the doorway of the restaurant during the hour when the room rehearses being a room and has not yet invited people to be their better selves at its tables. He hesitated as one does on company thresholds when one is holding nothing you can pretend is a present, and then he said nothing, and then he said more nothing, and Lorna, who is a librarian of silences in addition to everything else her job is not paying for, moved towards him with hands that did not reach for his, and asked, gently as if carrying china, what name he would like her to use. It would have been comic if it were not the exact right question. The boy opened his mouth and no name arrived. Sound did, and the sound brought with it air and the air got him as far as a syllable that could have been the start of seventeen different lives and then he shook his head and pressed his lips together and frowned, and Mr Cook, who has a doctorate in frowns and their implications, recognised the particular anguish of a man who had been asked to perform his name and discovered that the instrument had been borrowed without permission.\n\nThey did not make a festival of it. They did not cry out that their theory had been proven, that the Borrower Not Exactly had returned something not in pieces but inside out. They made tea and sat him at the corner table under the radio and laid down paper and offered pens as if he were a man about to write the first letter of his first language and the room would wait as long as it took. He did not write. He held the pen as if he were checking whether it was sharp enough to defend him and then as if he had missed a step and found himself, luckily, still upright. Victorine stood far enough back that the air would not have to choose between the boy and the fact of her, and she had to put her hand to her belt because an old habit twitched\u2014she almost reached for him with paper. She almost took the soft boundary that had been made vulnerable so she could keep it safe, which is love and theft at once. She did not. The boy\u2019s mouth was not hers to keep. She watched instead the way his lower lip tried to remember a vowel and did not find it, and she hummed very quietly, a hum that did not try to persuade, only to console, and the radio, because radios are mimics when they're good, lowered itself into a Shipping Forecast like a warm bath.\n\nJune arrived because some rooms summon her by habit now without anyone calling and because she needed somewhere to wait with her hands not being used to cradle a student\u2019s fear while the student pretended not to tremble. She looked at the boy and saw at once that there was no wound to bind, there was an absence to guard, and she said, not to him, not to anyone, Try \u201cI\u201d. He tried. It came out like a door edge catching. She stepped closer, made a shape with her lips that he could mirror without feeling mocked, and said \u201cI\u201d in a way that put the vowel on the table in front of him as a sweet, a manageable, safe thing, and he did it, and Mr Cook watched the boy\u2019s throat move and saw the little gratitude that always arrives when someone grants you the first person, and he nearly wept because he is not unaccustomed to being the person people say I to for the first time in a night. They gave him a badge from June\u2019s box\u2014Borrowed, because it is possible to be merciless and merciful at once if the word is precisely chosen\u2014and he pinned it with the ceremony of a liability becoming an asset.\n\nHe could not give a name, but he could give other truths, which is how you recognise a person and not a system. He told them, after he learned \u201cI\u201d and \u201chere\u201d and \u201chungry,\u201d that he had a left foot that was two millimetres smaller than his right, that he carried his keys on a lanyard because he liked to be punished with noise for forgetfulness, that his grandmother had died in the spring and he had learned that grief has pollen, that he could make a Yorkshire pudding rise with a frown if forced, that he had kissed a boy under a tree whose name he could not say now not because it was gone but because saying it would break the boy, and that he had come because the radio in the restaurant hummed a note he had known before he knew language and he had followed it as you follow an old smell up stairs that have not learned your steps. He could not say who he was. It did not make him less. It made him more to them, actually, because love will always prefer the particular to the legal. Lorna gave him soup and told him she loved a man once who needed three spoons for breakfast and left two at home out of spite and he laughed, a real laugh, which is a document more binding than anything at a registry.\n\nOutside, the city was shedding its labels the way a tired person rubs off the dampness behind their knees and tells nobody. They noticed first on the way to the shop for milk when Mr Cook lifted his eyes to the corner and saw the street name misbehaving. Not missing\u2014worse. Slid. The metal screws still bit the stone. The enamel rectangle bearing the word had surrendered and been walked with two inches to the left so that the word did not point where the street actually went. A kindness if you liked to be lost; a cruelty if you had an appointment with dignity. They walked, separately and then together, and saw more: a plaque that had been politely rotated so that the man in bronze died by a different river; an alley that could no longer remember whether it was a Close or a Wynd and had started answering to Lane; a brass letter gone missing so that Bread became Read and the baker grinned once and then did not. Names matter to cities because they are shortcuts for breath. Somebody was changing shortcuts and asking lungs to improvise.\n\nThe promoter had been leaning on their map for weeks like a child at the counter of the sweet shop he can just reach and pretending that he worked here so that if trouble came it would not ask him for the bill. They went to him because he had a power they could harness that would not bring uniforms and checklists into rooms that could not bear them; he could put a message into a night and make it viral not by algorithm but by personality. Lorna was sent because he liked her and wanted to be liked by her and it would make the conversation faster. She put a scarf around her mouth because she knows the trick in theatres where you cannot move the spotlight but you can make its job easy, and she asked him to do nothing, to restrain himself from what he thinks he does well, and he nearly said yes immediately because he would have done anything exactly opposite of flattery for her. She told him not to call names at doors. She told him to call not-names instead, the words from June\u2019s box, Loud, Homeward, Soup, Borrowed, Always, Quiet, Again, and he did not laugh because he is smarter than that, he is a man who has looked at his habits and found his mother in them and learned to ask for fussing in other ways. He made a post, then three, that said Tonight we\u2019re not doing names, we\u2019re doing roles, we\u2019re doing conditions, we\u2019re doing we. He did it with a wit that made the belligerent soften because being funny is sometimes less manipulative than being sincere. Boys turned up at doors and said their badge words and were admitted and the Borrower, which learns instruction sets faster than it learns songs, made a noise somewhere between fur and paper and was denied a few easy meals.\n\nThe bowl complained in a new language that afternoon, not with sound, with temperature: it cooled in the middle as if a coin had been pressed to it and removed and inside the cool was a shape like a mouth left open under water. Mr Cook rested his fingers on it and felt, with that new, intolerable sensitivity his life had grown, that somewhere someone was practicing an ask. He told the bowl, which may have been for himself, to keep his name asleep very deep and not to answer even if it is asked in the voice of someone who knows where he keeps his receipts. He did not say out loud that what he feared now was not the Borrower learning how to ask; it was the Borrower learning how to listen. He wrote on the placemat map another line, a shallow snake where the street names had been shifted, and the biro obeyed him even though it was tired and could have been forgiven for giving up.\n\nThey took the bowl to a potter in Abbeyhill who has the hands of a person who has taught earth to wait and has forgiven the earth for its impatience. The potter looked at the fine map of lines and nodded in the manner of women in white aprons in rooms where theatre is not welcome. She said there is a crack that can be sung closed and there is a crack that, if you sing at it, will sing back and split you for your trouble. She ran her fingertip along the inside of the crazing as if reading the minute gossip of the glaze, pressed her ear to the lip as if a seashell lived here, and said that this bowl wants ink in its wounds, not gold. Kintsugi is a romance for bowls that want to show off their damage and call it style. Your bowl prefers secrets. She made them a thin solution of soot and starch and vinegar and told them to paint the very finest lines with the very finest brush and then to put the bowl in a warm place and tell it three stories about patience. Lorna took the brush because her hands are small and obey her and Victorine told the first story and June the second and Mr Cook the third, which was about the night he stayed at work an hour after close because the dishwasher spoke anxiously, and it worked the way love often does: not on the surface at once, but underneath, in the bit that will hold next time.\n\nVictorine\u2019s belt was heavier every day with proofs she needed and proofs she had been made to keep by the logic of her own vow, and that afternoon she admitted to an idea that had been tapping politely on her shoulder for two days: to spend photographs like coin. It broke one of her rules but rules are cheap when boys are disappearing and the city is tired of being misnamed. She took five of the squares she had sworn to hoard and she climbed to a roof because roofs are chapter headings whether you like it or not, and she made, with her huge careful hands, little birds out of them. They were not perfect birds, but they were undeniably creaturely, and she set them on the parapet and breathed on them and said, Go where someone needs to remember their mouth is theirs, and she did not know whether she meant the boys or the Borrower or the city. They did what paper does in Edinburgh when asked for flight; they remembered all the wind that had come before and they behaved like writing. You could have seen them anywhere that day: caught on a pinboard outside a bar with the oily thumbprint of an owner who had been moved against his traditions, in the slot of a letterbox where an old woman reached and thought for a second she was being returned something she had not asked back for, on the lap of a statue that had finally been kissed. It cost her, the way giving away proof costs; it made the book in her head less certain, it hastened the day when her belt would be light and her grief would not know what to eat. She did it anyway, because men were not being kept safe by rhetoric.\n\nStability held as long as it could under the new rules, which is to say half a day. The Borrower Not Exactly arrived in a different coat\u2014the shoulders were almost perfect now, which is sinister, and the shoes were worn in the correct place by being deliberately scuffed with a rock by someone who had been told where to aim\u2014and it tried its new trick on the person least inclined to treat tricks like entertainment. It waited until Lorna was hauling a bag of lemons out of a taxi and said, in a voice she had not known she had teaching rights over, What do you want. It was not the man with the scarf or the boy with the letter mouth or any of the city\u2019s decent rough men. It was her father, but not; it was the voice he would have used if he had loved her enough to make choice sound like a promise and not a threat. She did not drop the lemons because the muscles that lift sacks are not the ones questions break. She put the bag down. She did not turn. She said, clear as a closing statement in a room with no judge, We are closed. The sentence behaved like holy water on nonsense. The man making himself a coat flickered, a haddock under the surface, and was bored. Boredom is the instrument their choir has learned. It left because it preferred being feared and could not find fear in people carrying citrus.\n\nThe signs kept changing and they kept changing them back with chalk because chalk has no time to be precious and because returning a name to a wall is the same work as returning a name to a mouth; you find the place where gravity has been misapplied and you lean. Mr Cook became an expert at the way municipal screws lie to you and at how much pressure enamel can take before it says mind yourself, and he made friends with a man with a van who is gentle with awkwardness and will come when rung because he has been rung in worse circumstances, and the man brought a screwdriver set that has learned compromise. They began to get good at it. A street noticed. It is not nonsense; the city notices when its handles are held properly. Bruntsfield Links held its own letters still for a night, as if in gratitude, and the Meadows, which has always been a place that forgives lying down, forgave two boys for lying down in a part where grass is not a good idea, and the fox watched and did not roll his eyes.\n\nIt felt for a minute like they had tricked disaster into being a job and then disaster remembers itself by getting personal. The boy with the moon of a scar came through the door of the restaurant carrying a smile like a tea tray, and if you had written the moment down simply\u2014Boy returns, scar intact, says hello\u2014you would have abased yourself before the miracle and gone home to sleep. But the boy did not say hello. He opened his mouth and the first thing that came out was the number Mr Cook had not called, and the number trembled a little as if not convinced of its own place here, and then the boy spoke with absolutely ordinary ease about tea and sauce and whether this napkin liked him and what time it was in Paris, and Mr Cook was happy and angry and ecstatically relieved and then he hit the wall of shame that is meeting a return not with gratitude but with an audit. He looked at the mouth and listened for the inside voice and could not hear it, and it was terrible, because how do you tell someone who has been delivered to you not exactly wrong that they may have been brought back right in a way that does not include themselves. He did not tell. He did his job, which is not to take from people what they bring. He fed him. He watched his hands. He watched the way he checked his pockets, and saw nothing that looked like a coding error. It would take days. They had given the Borrower boredom. It had returned the favour by giving them doubt so slender you could sharpen a thought on it.\n\nThey had a plan and hated it, which is a sign of good planning. They would take Mr Cook\u2019s hidden name, the one the blue bowl warmed and the kitchen took care of as if it housed a bird that would sing if allowed but would catch cold if asked, and they would set it in the path of the thing that had learned to ask questions and see whether it could be trained to enjoy being wrong. June spoke against it in the way generous women speak against harm they will do anyway if it is the only not-harm left; she said that teaching the Borrower the shape of a good question would, necessarily, involve admitting that good questions often get answers and that the person asked risks having to travel. Victorine said she would go in his place inside the word if she could, and there was a moment when the air in the room was a decision, and then the fox sneezed because the pepper had been left open and the spell was broken and they hung their coats of resolution back on the pegs where promises live.\n\nThe city, which has seen worse, yawned around sunset and sat down to wait for whatever it had been promised by this new crop of amateurs with their bowls and their choir and their dignified insolence. Men on ladders put lights up across streets to pretend it was always festival and not survival, and girls in jackets put glitter on their cheeks because not all magic is municipal and sometimes the glamour you need is the kind you make and wipe away, and the promoter stood on a chair outside a venue and shouted Not your name, your word, and boys held up their badges and said Soup like a prayer, and no one was embarrassed because they had been given a format that kept humiliation at bay. The Borrower tried to learn glitter and failed because glitter is loyal to trouble but not to boredom. It pivoted and went to the docks and walked along looking for old names in rust. It found plenty and found them poor substitutes for the fresh flowers it had acquired the taste for. It called them anyway as a child will call the names of ships when no one is watching, and the emptiness answered like a gull.\n\nVictorine went to sea to ask permission because she refuses to be the sort of mythical creature that helps itself to powers invented by people who have not walked in rain. She stood on the pier in Leith and bent and put her ear to the rail like a woman trying to hear whether the train inside the metal has chosen sides yet, and she asked the Forth if it would allow her to take a picture of a reflection and not the face, and the Forth, which knows about duplicity and does not get excited about it, said with a slap against a tire that it did not mind as long as she looked at the water when she pressed the shutter. She did. A mouth looked back up at her from below that was not a face attached to a boy and not a face attached to a man but something else, and its lips moved around a name that even she would not grant her camera. She took the picture anyway because permission had been granted by the only authority she would not argue with and because the act felt exactly like penance and throughout the city there was, for an hour, a dryness that did not belong to the air and did not last.\n\nThey carried the blue bowl to the bridge and set it in the light that is not light, the one June knows how to coax from breath, and Mr Cook took the little piece of paper with the first name he had not used and placed it inside on a bed that was not rice and not salt but napkins folded so precisely you would think someone polite was coming and he climbed back into his own body as if he had been standing outside it for the duration of a small errand. The Borrower came just as badly as a late guest who believes themselves irresistible. It wore no coat at all now, which is a threat or an apology depending on the angle, and it asked, with the new trick of hesitation that it had always lacked, What do you want, Mr\u2014 and then it opened its mouth for the name it had not been given and the hum was a hand set flat against it. Mr Cook heard his own name as he had never heard it, between other people\u2019s breath, and he did not answer because he is capable of not being polite when the situation requires it. He did what Lorna had done. He used the phrase that makes a boundary out of air. He said, We are closed. He said it as if closing were not a refusal but an act of caretaking, as if you shut doors so you can open them later, and the thing that borrows paused, not in boredom, this time in a new experience altogether. It had been refused as one refuses, and it looked at him with a curiosity that felt like being slowly read by someone who will not skip any words.\n\nIt left him there with his name in the bowl and walked around and tried the trick on the blue. The blue did not answer and later when he held the bowl in his hands he could feel where the question had fallen on the glaze like rain. He dried it with a towel the way a man dries a child out of the bath and the towel remembered him for it. Victorine took the square from her camera, the one that had been developed in the salt of the Forth, and laid it beside the ribbon with mutual suspicion arranged like a centrepiece, and the ribbon did not leap and the square did not burn and the radio read the capes of the British Isles like a rosary and the fox climbed onto a chair and sat as if a meeting had been convened for his benefit and everyone had forgotten why.\n\nNews spread as it does, along wires that are not wires and through the medium of the out-breath. A boy who had learned the hum taught it to his mother without explanation and she found herself at the sink later whispering vowels into the water and refusing to be embarrassed by the sensation of being old and new at once. The council man came back with a badge June had given him tucked under his lapel where only rituals could see it, and he did not talk about forms. He talked about a sign on a building that held a name for people who want to become families that had been turned to face the wall, and he turned it back, and for the first time in days he felt his job had done good that did not hurt anyone. A pile of left shoes appeared on the steps of a church because guilt is practical, and the vicar, who has seen almost everything and has the posture of a man who has been allowed to be tired, looked at them and knew that it is not his job to ask how. He arranged them as if someone might come for them later when the story permitted mercy.\n\nThere was a failure because it would be indecent to forget to record one. A boy stood on a bridge at two and forgot his badge and forgot his hum and answered to a name in a voice that tasted like Irish stout and parental permission and he went with the man with the exact shoulders and they disappeared into a warehouse that Mr Cook had not yet drawn on his placemat because he believes in the decency of paper and had wanted to spare it a grievance it could not address. They did not save him. They were not there. The next day the plate of his mouth was returned to a photograph in Victorine\u2019s belt in the careless way a child returns a borrowed book to the nearest flat surface and she cried, silently and messily, because consent had been vandalised, and it cost her nothing but the proof that a god would have taken and she does not know how to make gods and refuses to. They did what they do when they cannot undo: they told the city his name without using it, by carrying his bag for a week in their hands and by asking a waitress in a cafe to sit down and by picking up a dropped phone and leaving it on a bench where the original owner could imagine finding it.\n\nAt the end of a long day of this kind of measuring success in edible spoons, June said that they should put the bowl on the piano because a bowl that wants to travel and learn places needs to learn patience sitting with instruments that were designed for it. They did. The bowl agreed with the wood. It learned to resonate in a register that was not domestic. It learned to accept applause without cultivating a taste for it. It sat while June played the accompaniment to a song that children learn when a teacher who remembers how to teach has time, and it had to bear Lorna\u2019s scarf again because the room was not warm enough and she had decided that the scarf was now a garment for objects that might catch a cold. Mr Cook put his forehead to the lid for a minute and let it carry him and then he took a breath and stood up and went back to the restaurant because service does not forgive itself if you excuse it twice.\n\nThere is a way of living in which every ordinary gesture becomes a ritual because the things that used to be solid\u2014the names of streets, the invitations to speak, the usefulness of uniforms\u2014have become polite suggestions and you need somewhere to put your certainty. Mr Cook learned to wipe a counter as if he were writing to the Borrower a sentence that begins, Not today, and to lift a glass as if he were about to bless it with the safety of anonymity, and to answer the phone with the briskness of a doctor whose waiting room has the right number of chairs. Victorine learned to stand smaller without shrinking and to talk less even to herself because words learn secrets whether you intend them to or not, and to sleep in pieces and to accept that her belt will one day be light and this will be called an ending by people who were not there for the middle. Lorna learned to teach the hum to girls who sell shots with names that make men brag their false tolerance and to Patrol the boards where boys still insisted on photographs and to remove the ones that had been tampered with without making a fuss that would taste like fame later.\n\nThe city settled into the new arrangement the way a person settles into a new pair of shoes that are exactly right and still raise a blister on the third day. It did not complain loudly. It put its head down on the table when nobody was looking and cried twice and washed its face and got back on with it. The Borrower Not Exactly did not go away because things that are made of our habits rarely do. It altered its timetable and it began to ask questions that were easier to turn away because they reminded you of being a child who had just learned please and did not yet understand that please is not a master key. It lost interest for an afternoon and took three street signs instead in a walk along the curve of a road that thinks it is a river, and the signs were found later at the bottom of a stairwell where two boys kissed because they were late for an argument and had decided to reschedule the argument for a time when arguments were more likely to make things better. The signs were returned and someone wrote with a marker on the pole, WE KNOW YOU LOVE NAMES. COME INSIDE, and the fact that they had written COME INSIDE on a pole made Lorna choke and laugh until she had to sit.\n\nWhen the council brought railings to the bridges, because the story about bicycles and danger had been escalated in the appropriate manner and the city enjoys its theatre, Mr Cook wrote a letter as he had promised saying thank you, and he meant it, and he wore a tie he had not worn since he had told a landlord that he would not be cowed and the landlord had believed him because the tie had been expensive enough to imply a measure of safety. They stood with mugs of tea at midnight and watched as men with the right tools made edges that would not permit boys to misjudge the choice between leaning and falling, and the Borrower stood a little to the left and pretended it was a lamppost and learned nothing useful because railings belong to the part of the city that enjoys prevention, and it is a vintage it does not drink.\n\nAt last, when it had been almost quiet for two days and silence had become a sound you could rest your spine against, the bowl asked to be placed by the window with human words, and Mr Cook looked at June and June looked at Lorna and Lorna looked at Victorine and they decided to behave as if asking had been enough and not demand an essay. They placed it on the sill where steam looks for glass to bless. Outside, the name of the street had been restored precisely and the fox was carrying a slice of pizza with the solemnity of a person delivering organ donations. The bowl looked out at the reflection of its own blue in the pane and made the softest noise a bowl can make without being touched, and Victorine said she thought perhaps it wanted to see whether it could keep something safe through glass, and Mr Cook laughed a small laugh because that is the vocabulary of his whole life. He laid his name in it again because the dish has become a house and the house does not object to children making dens in the same corner every time, and then he went to the door because someone had knocked in the pattern people who come only when something matters use without knowing they do it, and when he opened it the boy with no name and the boy with the moon scar were there, not touching, not brothers, but arranged by need the way tables arrange themselves in a restaurant when you miscount and it still works.\n\nThey came in and sat and the hum rose without being asked and the radio smelled of rain and the ribbon lay exactly as long as it had to and the picture from the Forth admitted that whatever she had asked the sea for, she had received a call and had declined it, and in that refusal there was a new step to walk. The Borrower Not Exactly stood in the lane and learned the new ritual of civilians: to walk away because the room is filled with people who have agreed to mean what they say for the next hour, and it stood there a second longer than it needed to and made a little sound that could have been admiration and could have been the elastic snapping in a cheap shoe. The city exhaled. Mr Cook fetched bowls. Lorna told the boys the story about the lemons without embellishment. June tuned the air with the pinch of her fingers as if it were dough and the fox, who is pious in his own way, sat by the door and watched the weather to make sure it did not change without telling them.",
