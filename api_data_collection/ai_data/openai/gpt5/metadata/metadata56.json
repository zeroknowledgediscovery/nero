     "novel_text": "At the hour when the dust turns silver and the owls yawn, King Sid of Fresno walked the eastern parapet and stared at his city like a man who had inherited a stubborn animal. The roofs were low and sun-bleached. The river beyond was stitched with irrigation lines, little veins going every direction, carrying a kingdom\u2019s lifeblood to thirsty almonds, grapes, cotton, orchards that made a map of patience when seen from the old courthouse tower. Someone had painted royal blue along the crenels during his father\u2019s days, and now it peeled in the shape of islands and animals. He liked to name them quietly. That one a sea horse. That one a snake with two heads. He could name everything in sight, and it still felt unnamed.\n\nHe wore a crown of hammered copper set with amber, a compromise with the land; gold was for the coast, with its salt minds and pearl brides, and Fresno was copper, good metal, honest and warmed by hands. The crown sat a little crooked on him, no matter how often Dolores the steward nudged it. He pretended not to notice. The wind brought him the scent of wet silt mixed with dry straw and diesel ghosts. The canal gates were opening, the ditchriders whistled, and the city shook itself awake.\n\n\u201cMajesty?\u201d Dolores had a habit of arriving like a second thought and becoming impossible to ignore. She was narrow and solemn, all knuckle and ledger and an eye that saw through excuses like sun through thin cloth. \u201cThe Mendota siphon burned again last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain.\u201d Sid rested his hands on the parapet so he could feel the cool stone. \u201cAnyone hurt?\u201d\n\n\u201cA rider named Rafael. He breathed too much smoke. He\u2019ll live if his wife can keep him from talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the water?\u201d\n\n\u201cRunning, but crooked. We had to let three hours go to save the eastern fields. The figs will complain.\u201d She glanced down into his city, where the market was unrolling like a rug and the butchers\u2019 shade tents popped open in the pale light. \u201cWe found her mark.\u201d\n\nSid didn\u2019t ask whose. The city had learned not to say her name loudly; it made the children stare toward the river with too much story in their eyes. He nodded. \u201cShow me.\u201d\n\nDolores held up a cloth packet. Inside, a bone token, smooth with handling, etched with a lattice of fine cuts that made it glitter when the light caught it just so. A thread cut many times. People had started to call her Threadcutter. It sounded like something from old folktales you told in the heat, to make the skin go cool with dread.\n\n\u201cWord is,\u201d Dolores said, \u201cshe wants a parley.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe word?\u201d He turned the token over and over. There was a nicked corner, a little dent. He wanted to imagine her teeth there. He told himself not to.\n\n\u201cWord came with a man whose ear has her scar. And he came through the old fig orchard without anyone catching him. Either we are bats in daylight or we were meant not to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeant not to see,\u201d Sid said. The token slid lightly across his palm, alive. \u201cWe see what she wants.\u201d\n\nDolores\u2019s mouth became a string pulled tight. \u201cYou could deny her. Make a thing of it. No parley with thieves. We are a kingdom. This is not some play.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is exactly some play,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everyone knows it. And the ones who pretend not to are the worst at watching their bags.\u201d He turned his face back to the horizon. The low ridge beyond the fields was blue in the morning, and further than that the Sierras pretended to be clouds. Once, as a boy, he had thought the mountains were people sleeping. People who could wake. \u201cI\u2019ll meet her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith how many?\u201d Dolores\u2019s pencil hovered over the air, hungry for numbers.\n\n\u201cWith whoever thinks I can survive on my wit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a small mess of somebodies, Majesty.\u201d\n\nHe grinned. He didn\u2019t do it often in council, but up here the air was unjudging. \u201cThen I will owe you a new mess.\u201d\n\nDolores bowed just enough to appease the notion of respect and left with the token caught again in her careful hands. Sid watched her go, then braced himself for the descent. The tower had steps like bad decisions, steep and spalling. He took them anyway.\n\nThe hall at the old courthouse had been cleared of its long benches decades ago to make space for maps and fishers\u2019 nets, banners stolen from places that were not kingdoms anymore, and the throne his father had made from cherrywood and a plow blade. His father had been a man who believed you could make anything into something else if you hammered long enough. Sid had the same gift, people said, except still gentler hands. He sat, and when the guards and riders and canal men had taken their places\u2014anywhere, there was no court ceremony for this\u2014he lifted an arm like a man quieting a rowdy table.\n\n\u201cSpeak,\u201d he told Ajit, master of canals, a cheerful fellow who had a laugh like ditchwater and who smelled perpetually of minerals. Ajit was missing two fingers. He had lost them to a gate chain; he wore the loss like a medal.\n\n\u201cSpeak? I been speaking all morning,\u201d Ajit said. \u201cRosales is down there at the siphon crying like a goat and I told her I\u2019ll give her all the rags she wants but crying won\u2019t unburn cypress. Someone set a clean fire, majesty. And you can\u2019t set a clean fire in damp wood unless you know the wood. She knows it. I\u2019m telling you.\u201d He looked around, dared a contradiction. No one offered one. \u201cShe knows our lines. She knows our nights. I ain\u2019t saying we got a leak, but, you know\u2014\u201d he spread his hands the way men did when they meant everything and didn\u2019t want to say it outright.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s on night watch at Mendota?\u201d Sid asked.\n\nLearning that there had been a poker game somewhere there was meant to be a man on a horse with a lamp filled the hall with a windless sort of guilt. Sid heard it hiss across teeth and thought of all the small things that made a leak a flood. \u201cTell Rosales to keep her rags,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd send me a few good riders who can keep quiet and ask questions looking friendly. Not noble. Friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t noble,\u201d Tomas\u2014the jester, although no one in Fresno had a taste for jester hats and cornets\u2014said from where he was sprawled on a spool of blue rope. Tomas had a way of speaking from the angle of things, like light that came in through a crack you forgot existed. \u201cWe\u2019re parched and mean and God-chosen.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod is tired of being chosen,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cHe keeps asking for receipts.\u201d\n\nLaughter. It loosened the air. Sid savored it. He had grown up among a people who could make jokes standing in line for water, because you had to laugh or you\u2019d start hating the person in front of you simply because they were thirsty, too. \u201cAnd the parley,\u201d he said when the amusement had thinned to a manageable hum. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet at the old fig orchard. I\u2019ll take four.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour?\u201d Ajit straightened. \u201cThere\u2019s bandit stories ripe like grapes about that orchard. They say your voice comes back to you there and tells you all the things you said wrong. It\u2019d take twenty, to drown it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting on listening,\u201d Sid said. \u201cPick the four.\u201d\n\nThey chose them as quietly as you choose people to carry a stretcher: Vera with the lazy eye and the bad temper, a rider named Santi who had survived three winters in the foothills alone after his wife died, a young woman called Bee for the pattern of freckles on her face, and Dolores herself, because it was unthinkable for the steward to let her king go into the orchard to be unaccounted for. Ajit tried to come. Sid shook his head. \u201cYou send late water to the figs. Not too much. Enough to make them sweet, not enough to make them swell and split, so they wonder at their fortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s witchcraft,\u201d Ajit said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s farming,\u201d Sid said. \u201cSame difference.\u201d\n\nHe took off his copper crown, set it upon the plow throne, and put on a woven hat with a brim wide enough to shade a horse. In the mirror shards set into the pillar near the throne he saw a face he liked less and less each year: lines forming at the corners of a mouth that always tried to be kind and sometimes had to be something else, a scar on his left cheek\u2014not a noble one; he had cut himself on a rain gate in his first summer as king. His eyes were his mother\u2019s. Everyone told him. They told him so often he stopped knowing what his own eyes looked like to himself and only knew the story. That afternoon, he had dreamed of her hand on his crown, firm and quick, giving no time for refusal. It had happened. He had not dreamt it. He touched his temple.\n\nThey rode out in a heat that did not yet mean it but had rehearsed the lines for months. The old fig orchard crouched east of the city in a fold of land that caught fog in winter and secrets at all seasons. Half the trees were wild and half pruned, and the ones on the edges were in constant debate about which to choose. The ground was soft with dropped fruit, sour and sweet, a bargain with bees. Sid tasted one, its skin a little like paper, the inside honey-plush. He remembered a boy with his hands aluminized by moonlight, filling a bucket in the orchard and eating two figs for every one he saved. The trees had a way of leaning in to listen.\n\n\u201cI hear nothing yet,\u201d Tomas murmured. He had come anyway, because he oft came and no one could recount why until he said something and then you were grateful. He wasn\u2019t one of the four. He was the fifth that followed five steps behind and became the story people told later.\n\nIt had been agreed with whispers that there would be no archers in the trees and no horses brought into the grove. So there were archers, hidden badly enough that Sid could find them, and one horse that belonged to someone who didn\u2019t much like rules. He saw the horse first. A pale gray mare with a black mane like spilled ink, who tossed her head in the shade, a queen tired of her crown. The man holding her rein was small and unfrightening, so he was a message. The messages mattered more than the words sometimes. Sid dismounted.\n\nA woman stood near the largest tree. She had the casual stance of someone whose knife obeyed, and a dress that had once been a soldier\u2019s coat cut to fit the body she had made without anyone else\u2019s permission. In the shade her hair turned blue-black. She had wrapped a red scarf around her throat in a way that dared you to grab it and also promised to garrote you with it if you tried. He had never seen her face before. He had seen drawings of it that made legends out of cheekbones. He wished he were a poor man anywhere else.\n\nShe did not curtsy. He did not expect it. She stepped forward and offered him a fig. \u201cWe\u2019re obliged, King,\u201d she said. \u201cA parley, is it? That\u2019s the right word. We both have songs we want to sing and don\u2019t have the right throat for.\u201d\n\nSid took the fig. \u201cIf I had the right throat I could sing my song from the roof and you\u2019d hear it in your sleep with no efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sleep is unruly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gets up and walks around. I tell it to settle down, be good, but it keeps meeting the wrong people.\u201d\n\nDolores cleared her throat, which was the opposite of a song. \u201cBe plain,\u201d she said. \u201cPlain saves lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlain is ugly,\u201d the woman said. \u201cPlain won\u2019t look you in the eye afterwards but does not lie about it. You want plain? I\u2019ll give you the plain: stop locking the river like it\u2019s a woman you stole.\u201d\n\nVera murmured an apology to someone for her breath and shifted her weight. Bee sucked a seed out of her teeth and looked down. The woman in the red scarf stared only at Sid. \u201cIt is not yours,\u201d she said, and her voice softened, so that the figs and the bees leaned in. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s. You have built clever gates. You\u2019re good. The men who work them are tired and proud. They deserve to be safe. But the river isn\u2019t yours. It\u2019s a line drawn by someone\u2019s finger once. And the finger moved over faces that were not yet born.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wear a soldier\u2019s coat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt belonged to someone who pointed. What\u2019s the difference between pointing at water and pointing at a man? Both go where you want as long as you\u2019re strong enough to make them sorry not to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said, and smiled, and the day did a strange thing, it stepped back to make room for the smile. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about sorry. It curdles. It grows teeth. Down river, the earth remembers the sound too easily. The old ones say there was a time before the Breakage when men argued in rooms and signed papers and the water still went where it wanted because it had all the time in the world. We don\u2019t have that time now. We have this season and the next, and the next might be ash.\u201d\n\nSid watched the way her hands moved in the air, making and unmaking. He watched the archers who didn\u2019t exist in the trees shift their feet. He heard his own voice the way you hear a horse\u2019s hooves on dry clay: warning and relief. \u201cWe can talk about gates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can talk about schedules. We can talk about extra water for the lowest fields when the figs need it most. We cannot talk about the river being no one\u2019s. Because if it is no one\u2019s it becomes the strongest one\u2019s. You know it. I know it. It\u2019s just whether the strongest is an office with ledgers and a lock, or a man with a scarf who will leave in the night after taking everything that shines.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I take the shiny things.\u201d The red scarf brushed her knuckles when she turned her head. \u201cThere are shinier things than copper and sugar. If I wanted all the shiny I would be in your hall counting tiles. I want a thing that can\u2019t be counted. That\u2019s troublesome, I know.\u201d Her eyes flicked to the crown he was not wearing. \u201cDo you think I like this?\u201d She tugged the coat. \u201cIt itches. The person it fit is dead. Men died to make me a stranger to myself and now there is no road that moves in a straight line.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he die?\u201d The question surprised him. He wanted to call it strategy and felt in his ribs that it wasn\u2019t.\n\nShe was silent so long a fig fell and split and the scent of sugar rose like an oath. \u201cHe drowned,\u201d she said. \u201cNear Firebaugh. He was pulled under by a snag of manzanita that everyone ignored because we all thought we knew the river better than we did. He went down believing in his own lungs. He came up too slow to do anything but show me his eyes. If I cut a thread now and then, know that he went down with all the threads in his hands, and I still am not sure if he meant to give them away or keep them.\u201d\n\nSid held the fig she had handed him and did not eat it. Flies touched the bruises on its skin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and did not try to make it a king\u2019s sorry that could right the world with a decree. \u201cWe can walk out there and cut the manzanita together.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour gates,\u201d she said, and her tone became a thing made of rocks. \u201cThey are manzanita.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me your name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know mine in a hundred stories. Let me have one word to say that means you and not the idea of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I give you my name,\u201d she said softly, \u201cyou\u2019ll keep it in your pocket and take it out when you\u2019re alone and hold it and it will grow warm and heavy and you\u2019ll know all its edges, and then when you\u2019re too far from me and you want to be close, you\u2019ll say it to yourself and that will be a kind of theft.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll find that edge no matter what you say,\u201d he said, and realized he had moved a little closer, and that everyone in both parties had noticed and not decided yet if it was dangerous.\n\n\u201cEryn,\u201d she said finally. \u201cMy name is Eryn Vale. And I would rather be a seamstress than a cutter of threads but you cannot stitch with gates.\u201d\n\n\u201cEryn,\u201d he said, and he did feel it, the weight. He felt the way the syllables sat on the tongue like a fruit pit, something that might grow if planted and might just choke you if you mis-swam. \u201cI\u2019m Sid.\u201d He almost said, I am Sid of Fresno, or King Sid, or any of the names that were less like him and more like duties. He didn\u2019t. \u201cCome walk,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will shoot if you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t shoot. Ask anyone. I\u2019m famous for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re famous for,\u201d she said dryly. But she walked, and they walked under the low branches, where the sun made little coins of light on the old grass. The others trailed at a careful distance, their footfalls different languages.\n\n\u201cYour men set a clean fire,\u201d he said, while a fly made its mind up about his hat brim. It was too blunt a thing to say. He said it anyway. \u201cThat was careful. It was also cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the taste of careful,\u201d she said. \u201cCruel lives next door. You keep telling yourself you only visit. The first night you sleep on that couch because you\u2019re tired. The second because it\u2019s easier to not go home in the dark. People make a nest in your hair. They tell you you look like you belong. You forget the way the sheets smell in the place where you said you would always lay your head.\u201d Her hand brushed his sleeve. He told himself she had done it to keep moving.\n\n\u201cIs there a way we can make new maps?\u201d he asked. \u201cMaps where a little is given without being stolen?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a treaty,\u201d she said. \u201cOn paper. With your stamp. With a witness. With Tomas to make a joke at the end that people will call wisdom if they like you and bad manners if they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomas is not wise,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am exactly wise enough,\u201d Tomas called from a branch he should not have been able to climb as quietly as he had. \u201cWhich is less than a god and more than a guard, and in the middle of everything stupid.\u201d\n\nEryn looked up at him and laughed in a way that made Vera relax for the first time all morning. \u201cHello, fool,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all remember the stories we tell ourselves to live,\u201d Tomas replied, and plucked a fig and missed his mouth and dropped it on his shoe. \u201cBut not the ones we tell ourselves to die.\u201d\n\nSid didn\u2019t know what to do with half the things Tomas said, not because he was a fool but because he was a mirror that refused to reflect anything but the person looking. \u201cIf you could make a treaty,\u201d Sid said, \u201cwhat would it ask for?\u201d\n\n\u201cDignity,\u201d she said with no flair at all. \u201cAnd a year. One year where you don\u2019t let a single acre rot because the wrong men were late. One year where no one\u2019s child walks seven miles for a bucket you\u2019ll sell back to them at a price you won\u2019t pay yourself. One year to see if I can stop cutting threads because there\u2019s nothing left to strangle anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can give you a year we both promise to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut being good is an agreement with a ghost. As soon as the water is low and the wind runs hard and the canals crack, men will feel old hunger. What then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d she said, and leaned in as if she were telling him how to cheat at dice, \u201cyou remember that there was a year you did not.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cDo you know how soft the river smells after the first rain? The dust lifts like a child to be held and then it falls down slow and you can taste a metal thing, and the worms come up, curious and brave, like men who have never had their hearts broken.\u201d\n\nHe saw it behind his eyes and, worse, in his chest. \u201cI know,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen you know why I\u2019m in your orchard saying too much.\u201d She straightened as if shaking off a hand. \u201cI am making a mistake here. I should be making a point with my elbow and my men\u2019s sharpness. And yet.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHere we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d he said, and he could feel the long afternoon ahead of him in which he would be unable to do any of the small useful things that kept the panic of being a king at bay. \u201cWe are. Will you eat with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your hall? No,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone will know and everyone will stare. They will watch your mouth to see what you choose to taste.\u201d She glanced toward the city as if to prove she could see it even through the trees. \u201cYou can eat with me. Where I sleep is nobody\u2019s idea of safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you sleep?\u201d He wanted to put himself in every place she said. He wanted to parcel himself into invisible pieces and hide them in the grasses and in the gorge and under the bark of the figs so he would always be with her and always know how to get back. The wanting made him ridiculous to himself. He forgave himself for it and it did not go away.\n\n\u201cIn a circle of ruin downriver,\u201d she said. \u201cAt night the old concrete walls sweat and the coyotes laugh at nothing. I will not tell you which circle. Not yet, Sid. Do not pretend to be shocked by not yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not dare,\u201d he said. \u201cI have done not yet so often I thought it was a town I owned.\u201d\n\nHe did not kiss her. It was barely possible, for a heartbeat, if the bees had all decided to go quiet at once and the archers had all sneezed from fig dust and the wind had stopped to tell them, the two of them just under the branch that held Tomas up like a bad idea in a good place. He did not. He thinks he didn\u2019t. Memory is a wayward dog.\n\nThey brought no treaty home, and if anyone had asked Sid what he had brought instead he would have held his hands apart and said the weight between them was not air and not good sense and not a lie. He ate fig jam on stale bread in the late afternoon with Ajit and listened to the man talk about gates like lovers. He half-slept in his chair and saw a river that had a mouth and spoke. He saw his father up to his knees in water cursing the things he loved for not being easier.\n\nThat night, under an angry moon that had somewhere else to be, a boy named Diego ran the south road with a story. He ran as fast as a story deserves. The guards at the tower took him in with a cup of something too weak to call coffee and stood him in front of the king who had put his crown on again because people were watching and watched him because he looked like a boy who might be the first page of a bad chapter.\n\n\u201cMajesty,\u201d the boy said, and then remembered to bow, and did so while still talking. \u201cThere\u2019s a shepherd in the foothills who saw fire walking like an animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople get drunk,\u201d Ajit said mildly from somewhere. \u201cAnd the imagination is a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. He was not drunk. We have no liquor left. His dog is burnt. He brought the paw. He wouldn\u2019t come in the city because he says he doesn\u2019t be in rooms, but he gave me the paw. He said tell the king the mountain has a tooth. He said words I didn\u2019t understand about rattling stone. He knows rocks, he\u2019s a man who knows rocks in his hands, and he said they were humming like someone breathing bad.\u201d\n\nTomas sat up straighter as if the floor had nudged him. \u201cHumming,\u201d he said, and the word fell into the open place that had just formed in the hall. \u201cIs that the word he used? He\u2019s a shepherd. Did he say humming. Or did he say singing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumming,\u201d Diego said. \u201cBut it got in his bones, he said, and then went away and took his breath. He wants his dog to be seen by a priest so whoever did this knows God saw it too. Please don\u2019t make me say it again. I ran.\"\n\nDolores took the paw with both hands like a sacrament and did not flinch. The pad was black and bubbled. Sid closed his eyes and saw flame organized into a body. He opened them and saw his people organized into hope. \u201cFind the shepherd,\u201d he said. \u201cBring him a woman who knows herbs and a man who knows rocks and someone who knows how to listen to men who have lived too long with sheep.\u201d He could feel around his words something too old for his throat. \u201cAnd send word up the old road. Ask it everything it knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cMajesty,\u201d Dolores said later, when the hall had emptied down to the skins of its conversations and only the work of tomorrow remained. \u201cIf there is fire walking\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNot yet. There is someone who saw too much of a thing he cannot name, and we will name it for him and then it will sit down. It will become a story with a beginning, and then it will be manageable.\u201d\n\n\u201cStories have middles.\u201d She rubbed her forehead with two dirty fingers. \u201cWe forget that. We always forget the middle is swamp.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to tell her Eryn\u2019s name and didn\u2019t. It sat whole in his mouth and made everything else taste like it. He went to his room and took off his crown and placed it on the window where the moon could see it and judge him. Down in the yard someone sang a song about men who choose the wrong women and then forgive them, which is to say, men who choose. The city\u2019s heat moved around him like a creature who did not mean to love him and did anyway, clumsily.\n\nIn the morning he went out with no guards and no crown. He went to the canal where the siphon had burned clean. He wanted to see the way the ash had organized itself when it fell. He wanted black on his hands as if touching what hurt in person made it less likely to happen again somewhere he could not reach. Rosales found him there. She was a short woman with shoulders like a yoke and a voice like a whistle. She called him King and then told him a story about her grandmother that had nothing to do with anything. He realized after that it had everything to do with everything. People loved by telling you what they could not hold anymore, because it spilled.\n\n\u201cShe left me her knife,\u201d Rosales said at the end, and showed him. The blade was old and new. Someone had ground it on new stone. It had a little nick.\n\nHe took it and it fit his hand as if he had held it before. \u201cDo you want it back?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIf you keep it,\u201d she said, \u201cyou keep her. And then she\u2019ll get you killed, and I will have to mourn twice. Give it to someone else who needs to pretend the past\u2019t steel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be. My grandmother would spit and say it\u2019s everyone.\u201d Rosales took off her hat and wiped her hair back. \u201cYou got a look, King. Like you saw a puddle that has sky in it and you jumped. Be careful, yes? That sky will drown you as quick as water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll practice holding my breath,\u201d he said, and then, because it was a morning for not yet, he closed his eyes and pictured Eryn catching a fig in one hand, her head thrown back when Tomas had said something only half was joke. He saw the red scarf like a wound and like a warning and like something you tied around a gift so that even if you were all elbows and wrong words the recipient would know you had tried to be splendid.\n\nHe returned to the hall. Papers waited with the patience of things that could outlive kings. He signed his name on water schedules and confirmed a levy on pistachios and allowed the songs of three old men who claimed to be the same man to be sung at market on Wednesdays. He corrected a scribe\u2019s spelling. He forgot what the old spelling had been. Night came and he did not ask Dolores to read back to him the day\u2019s mercies and crimes because he didn\u2019t think he could give each of them the same mouth.\n\nIn the solitude between lamps, someone came to his window. For a breath he thought the river had stood up and learned to climb. He reached for Rosales\u2019s knife and felt it in his hand like an answer to a question he was not done asking. A shadow detached itself from the shadow and sat on his sill as if it had every right and no shoes. Eryn. She had a way of changing the size of the room.\n\n\u201cThis is idiotic,\u201d she said without greeting. \u201cI could be anyone. You could have shot me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t shoot,\u201d he said. He stood and he was not surprised at all at how necessary it felt to be standing while she sat. \u201cHow. Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I realized after I left,\u201d she said, looking at his crown on the sill as if it were a small animal she might feed or not, who could say, \u201cthat if I let your people tell you about the thing up in the foothills they\u2019d clean it up so you would be able to sleep. And I wanted to see your face when you didn\u2019t. You make a particular face when you have one ache too many. It is not a king\u2019s face. It is a person\u2019s. You should be careful. It\u2019ll get you loved in the wrong ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dragon,\u201d he said.\n\nHer eyes, which had seemed to him like a lake at dusk, widened and lost everything but the reflection of his mouth. \u201cYou say it like it exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou came here to say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came here to not say it.\u201d She leaned back against the frame. Her scarf had no red tonight. It was gray as the mare she had brought to the orchard, and that felt like a kind of sacrament, too. \u201cThere\u2019s a pit up there. Or a bowl. Or a wound. And at the bottom of it something breathed and the rocks hummed, and a shepherd\u2019s dog got burned not by flame but by a sound. That\u2019s what the man said. He said his dog lay down because it thought it was night and the night made his hair go away. I saw the circle from far. I saw birds rise at wrong hours. I thought. Eryn, you need to be quiet. Your whole life you have been loud because that felt like the only way to exist. And now, hush, be small. But then I remembered you and how you said you know the smell of the earth when it lifts. And I did something stupid. I came.\u201d\n\nHe moved towards her because there was nothing else to do with his body. \u201cIf there is a dragon\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t educate it with your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is,\u201d he said anyway, \u201ceverything else we are arguing about is stubbornness at the wrong scale. We need to stop being clever with gates and be clever with worship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not going to worship a thing that burns dogs with sound.\u201d She turned to the night where the city lay, pretending to be a map and failing at it, badly. \u201cWe are going to make sure we live to fight our small war another day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we fighting?\u201d he asked.\n\nShe looked at him then, and he saw that her face could become lovely with cruelty or with joy and he would be unable to tell which would break him more. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to do anything else,\u201d she said, and reached for his crown and tipped it off the sill. He lunged, caught it. She laughed, because she had known he would and because it was very funny that a man who might have to become a myth had the hands of a ditchman. \u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t make in your heart a room for me yet. I am full of splinters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have rooms full of splinters,\u201d he said, and it sounded ridiculous when he said it and truer than anything else he had said that week. He set the crown down on the floor, where it made a ring of copper moonlight. \u201cStay,\u201d he said. It was not wise. It wasn\u2019t even cunning. It was a request from a kind of animal older than kingdoms.\n\nShe stood up on the sill without taking his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve already stayed too long. You have someone named Dolores who did not scream from a fig tree but will scream soon. She will tell you there\u2019s a man in the yard with a burned paw and a song about stone, and you will look at me and you\u2019ll want to ask me what to do. Don\u2019t. Decide with your people. When you need a person who knows how to not die when rocks sing, send a ribbon down the old canal tied in a knot I recognize. Don\u2019t write. Paper is greedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d he said, wanting to stop her without wanting to be a person who stopped things that moved fast. He didn\u2019t know what he intended to put after the words. He never did, and that was why he was always slightly behind everything he loved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your enemy in the way your men want,\u201d she said, and then was nothing but shadow again. \u201cI\u2019m worse,\u201d she said from down in the yard, and then there was only the night, which had, at last, settled down.\n\nDolores did scream. Not like a goat; like a woman whose ledgers had burst into flame. Sid went to the window for the second time that night and looked out over Fresno, his, and imagined the mountains as sleeping people and tried to imagine what face they would make if they woke and had no names left. He thought about his father\u2019s hands and his mother\u2019s eyes and Tomas in trees and Ajit loving his gates and Rosales\u2019s knife and Rosales\u2019s grandmother. He thought about Eryn\u2019s mouth shaping his name as if she were sewing with it.\n\nWhen the messenger ran through the gate and fell, Sid already had his boots on and his mouth set in the only line he knew for certain the city understood: we will go see. He went down, and out, and into his future like you go into a river you grew up beside: thinking you know it and knowing you might not, and going anyway, because you are from here. He was from Fresno. He was king. And he was a man who would, soon, learn the shape of dragons in his teeth and who else\u2019s name they could keep.Dolores\u2019s scream was not panic; it was a flare sent up so the necessary would gather. The yard below the window filled the way a cup fills when a heavy hand pours\u2014quickly and without apology. The boy who had run the story lay on his side, chest jumping like a fish netted and unsure of mercy. The shepherd stood apart from him, as men do who have spent too long with animals and wind. He held his hat in both hands as if he had come to a church he did not recognize but knew he should respect. Beside him, on a cloth that had held oranges once, lay the blackened paw. It was a thing that should not have been severed from anything, and yet it had been presented like a proof to a world that no longer believed without them.\n\n\u201cName,\u201d Dolores said, because names let you hold people steady.\n\n\u201cMateo,\u201d the shepherd answered, the lint at the edge of his cuffs smoked down to nothing. \u201cMateo of Dry Creek, the real Dry Creek, not that ditch you all call a creek to feel better. I kept my dog from whimpering for two hours and then he did not keep.\u201d He lifted his chin toward the foothills as if they were a person who had wronged him and did not yet know it. \u201cI have slept under oak that crackled with lightning and not broken. This is not that. The stones are behaving badly. It is a thing no one taught them and yet they learned. It went in my teeth. The old ones say the bones sing when the end comes. I am not old and I am telling you my bones sang.\u201d\n\nAjit came up behind Sid and stood a respectful half foot back the way men do when they want to catch a king if he falls but not crowd him into proving he won\u2019t. \u201cHumming in stone is not a ditchman\u2019s language,\u201d he murmured, more to the air than anyone. \u201cIt is a quarryword. We could ask old Tenorio. He listens to rocks like they whisper gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will ask everyone,\u201d Sid said. He stepped down into the yard, felt the looseness of sand under his boots, the easy bite of grit. He knelt by the cloth with the black paw and said a word he had never liked saying out loud because it was too simple to fit the sort of grief that came with it. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\nMateo stared at him as if he were a trespasser he might forgive on principle but not in practice. \u201cSorry is cloth you hold to a wound so your hand has something to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop the blood. Your men think the mountain is a drunk husband who will sleep it off. I am telling you it has a tooth and it is waking teeth first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go,\u201d Sid said, and before Dolores could remind him which signatures would be late, which men would take advantage, which gates would sit untended enough to tempt mischief, he raised his hands and shaped the morning as best he could. \u201cAjit stays and makes a map that counts men as well as gates. Send Rosales to the south siphon with two who can say no without shouting. Find Tenorio. Send word to the outposts that no one goes alone into circles or bowls or old quarries. Pair shepherds. Pair children. Pair anyone with feet. Dolores, count rope and lantern oil, and pull my riding coat that does not say King in every stitch. Bring the water skins that do not leak when a person wishes them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll water skins leak when you are tired,\u201d Dolores said, but she was already leafing through her mental ledgers and nodding to people who did not know that nod meant they were now part of the chapter they would retell to grandchildren. \u201cVera is with a toothache. We take Bee. We take Santi. We take Tomas whether we choose to or not. And we take Marta.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich Marta,\u201d Tomas asked from the edge of the ladder, where he had been listening with his head upside down as if the blood gathered there would make a better mind. \u201cBecause if you mean Marta of the yard, she is pregnant with a sadness and should not go near anything that hums. If you mean Marta of Piedra, she will spit and come and make the rocks behave by telling them her mother\u2019s stories until they feel foolish.\u201d\n\n\u201cPiedra,\u201d Dolores said, and Tomas saluted nothing in particular and veered off like a kite freed from a wise child\u2019s fingers.\n\nTenorio arrived as if summoned by consideration alone, an old man with calves like oaks and hands that had not known softness since his own mother\u2019s palm when he was a boy. He wore a string of tiny fossils around his neck the way priests wear bones. His hearing had gone in one ear and so he turned the good one toward Sid with a theatricality that made Bee hide a smile. \u201cThe earth makes music whether you listen or not,\u201d he announced without being asked anything. \u201cMostly it\u2019s a lullaby if you mind your feet. Sometimes it is a wedding song, you can tell because everything shakes in a way that makes people want to dance even if their knees were at war with them yesterday. You say it hummed.\u201d He looked down at the paw and made an old man\u2019s cross over his chest in a way that made Sid feel young and unwell. \u201cWe will hear if it wants us to.\u201d\n\nThey left the city by the east gate so that Fresno could watch them go and adjust its opinion of itself accordingly. People see kings leave and become either brave or foolish; Sid preferred brave and suspected most days that what he got was a braid of both. The road out was a two-lane memory where the asphalt sloughed like old skin, patched with gravel and volunteer grass that made the horses pay attention. The canals followed for a while like faithful dogs and then wandered off to flirt with fields, to promise and deliver and sometimes only promise. You could tell where the lines had been long before men put water in them by the way the land settled in upon itself, making gentler curves, a body remembering where it liked to be touched.\n\nThe foothills gathered long and blue-green, oak standing in their toadstool shade, granite showing itself in the honest way rock does when there is nothing left between it and sky. The heat had taken to itself a vocabulary\u2014cicada and dust and the kind of silence that isn\u2019t empty but is full of waiting. Santi rode as if the horse and his own bones were in a marriage that had shed its performative tenderness in favor of competence. Bee counted hawks and kept count out loud after the third because it was a comfort humans invented to keep from feeling as small as they were. Dolores balanced a ledger on her knee until the horse told her with a toss that she would regret it, and she put it away with a sigh that had arithmetic in it anyway.\n\n\u201cSay it again,\u201d Tenorio asked Mateo, who had come despite his eyes being hollowed by losing his dog. \u201cRattling stone. Humming. Breathing that had words in it or that was just air being unshy.\u201d\n\nMateo spat neatly in a way that managed not to offend anyone\u2019s gods. \u201cIt got into my hat. It made my belt hit my hip like a hammer. It made the sheep put their faces down and pretend they could go back into the earth like acorns. It was not wind. It was not the thing you feel when a truck goes by. It had direction. It came from a bowl and went in my teeth and then it left and all the birds were confused about the hour and sang the wrong songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong songs,\u201d Tomas said. He was on foot, because he liked to feel the pattern of the world with his ankles, as if his body could read the same text the land had always been writing. \u201cFools know wrong songs. They are like a joke that doesn\u2019t want to be funny and still is, because the person telling it is trying so hard not to think about their mother.\u201d\n\nSanti flicked a look at him that might have become a grin if the day were softer. \u201cDo you plan to make sense today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI plan to provide commentary,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cSense is a trick gods used to sell men fear.\u201d\n\nThey left behind the last almond rows where white shells had made a brief spring snow and turned into a kind of country that liked to pretend it was untouchable and then turned its ankle on a gopher hole. The oaks offered shade like a grandfather who wanted you to sit in it and tell him what you thought you knew so he could take it apart gently and give you new pieces. As they climbed, the river\u2014no longer neatly canal\u2014offered itself in glimpses of polish and tumble. Sid could smell it even when he could not see it, the way the nose remembers a friend on the day you mean to be dignified and are not. He nodded to the water because he had learned as a boy that talking out loud to things made your own bones listen.\n\nThe first hint of the bowl was not its shape but a quiet. It was not absence of sound so much as a shivering off of everything that could be called song. Cicadas went to ground. Flies forgot their history. The horses\u2019 ears tried to be useful and failed. After that came something like the note of a big bell rung in another valley, arriving disheveled and late, and then the taste\u2014metal, yes, but also something old that had been asleep under everything and was now adjusting to the idea that everything had been built without its consent.\n\nThey came over the lip and the circle lay below, shoulder-high to a giant, glassed in places as if some lunatic had taken an iron and smoothed the land. Dark stones gleamed like scales that had learned restraint. In the center, a depression glowed not with light but with attention. It drew the eye the way a hole in a story does. Around the edge, where the grasses had done their best to have dignity and failed, a pattern of ripple and furrow marked where sound had behaved like water. Sid wanted to kneel. He wanted to plant his palm flat on the dirt and ask so many questions that for a moment he could not think of one worth starting with.\n\n\u201cDo not speak,\u201d Tenorio said, and brought up a hand in a gesture so delicate it felt liturgical. \u201cThe earth is tuning. You wait to hear if you are wanted. Think about babies. Babies know when their crying is useful. We will be babies now and hold still like fools holding their breath.\u201d\n\nBee put her hand on her own throat as if to keep something in. Dolores folded her ledger against her chest and tried to look like a person who believed her columns would still matter in an hour. Santi closed his eyes and let the horse find balance without his help, because he had a faith in animal sense that had come from living through winter when winter meant weeks of listening to your own blood. Tomas climbed the lowest limb of an oak that leaned toward the bowl and lay along it like a thought that might be comfort if you spoke it right.\n\nThe hum came as a nothing that arranged dust. It made the hairs on Sid\u2019s arm decide to be trees in a wind. He felt it under his tongue, a new flavor, the way mint can surprise you in a stew and you cannot decide if you like the cook any better for it. The depression changed, slightly, the way a sleeping chest moves when the body underneath decides a deeper breath would help. A slow spill of small stones slid toward the center and then stopped, a minute failure that felt like mercy. The horses stamped. Mateo\u2019s hat brim trembled as if a tiny hand had flicked it and then was ashamed of the flick.\n\n\u201cWe are too close for ignorance and too far for courage,\u201d Dolores said, and the words were small and square and necessary.\n\n\u201cTake off your metal,\u201d Tenorio instructed, as if he were telling children to take off shoes before stepping onto a clean floor. \u201cCoins. Buckles. Not all of it. We are not pagans at a cousin\u2019s wedding. But the things that wish to sing with whatever this is, let them be silent. I have seen a man\u2019s tooth ring in his skull for a day after lightning made a point and he remained unconvinced. We don\u2019t argue with it. We say, excuse me, a chair for the elder.\u201d\n\nThey did as they were told in a way that might have been funny anywhere else. Kings unbuckling. Stewards loosening buttons with elaborate dissatisfaction. Fool plucking trinkets from his pockets as if they were rabbits who refused to winter. Sid took off Rosales\u2019s knife and held it for a long breath that felt like confession. He held it to his forehead and put it in the dust. He crouched and touched the ground with three fingers\u2014his father\u2019s superstition inherited without understanding\u2014and then let his hand flatten.\n\nHeat came through in a sheet that did not obey what he knew of heat. It did not scorch. It informed. He felt told. He felt like a boy sent from the table to wash his hands better. He had a violent, disorienting urge to apologize out loud to the land for every ledger, every gate, every clever well-timed release, every pride that had been dressed as planning. He swallowed and planted his hand harder as if pressure would make a different virtue.\n\n\u201cDoes it have a mouth,\u201d Bee whispered after the hum sagged into ordinary air again, then rose and then sagged, as if breathing had not yet become habit.\n\n\u201cIf it does,\u201d Tomas said from his tree, \u201cwe should be careful not to teach it how to kiss.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee there,\u201d Santi said, because there are always men who will point when a thing is too big for speech. On the far side of the depression, where the glassed soil met pale dust, a shape long and curved lay half-buried. It could have been a log, except it had the kind of geometry that logs don\u2019t learn. It had edges that remembered heat and had decided against it. It was dark like cooled forge. When the next hum lifted and the dust swam, the curve showed an under-pattern, lines like the maps the city kept, everything taking a place, and Sid had to press his hand to his mouth to not say the word he and Eryn had agreed not to teach the air.\n\n\u201cWe will not take steps toward it,\u201d Tenorio said. \u201cWe will not throw stones into this bowl as if we are children proving we exist by making ripples in another person\u2019s bath. The thing is older than our shouting. We will learn how to stand in the presence of it without breaking our own ankles.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are going to come here anyway,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cThe ones who think being first is a religion. The ones who think being right is. The ones who sell water in small cups.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will post men on the road,\u201d Sid said. He could feel how thin authority might become around a hole in the world. \u201cWe will make a circle around the circle and ask people to wait until we have a law that fits this. We will make a better law even if it must be uglier. We will tell them it hums in teeth and that should frighten anyone who uses theirs to chew their pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will work for an hour,\u201d Bee said. \u201cNot longer. We should talk fast inside that hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shepherds will listen,\u201d Mateo said. \u201cNot because of you. Because we are not eager to be rearranged. Tell the orchard men that this will make bees forget their beds. That will sober them. Tell the women who keep the graves that the earth here wants to talk too loudly over them and their dead will not hear properly. That will fetch their attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell the boys there might be a thing that breathes fire and then tell them the fire burns with sound,\u201d Tomas added. \u201cThey won\u2019t know what that means and that mystery will keep them cautious for some portion of a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet me a ribbon,\u201d Sid said. He felt foolish immediately and leaned into the foolishness because sometimes you had to cross a thing to make it a bridge. \u201cAnd get me someone\u2019s hands who know knots like language.\u201d\n\nBee had already pulled a scrap from the hem of her shirt, the piece she\u2019d torn off that morning to make a band for her braid. It was yellow with a faded line of blue that once might have been flowers and now was a suggestion. She frowned at it as if it had to be argued with, then set it between her teeth and freed her hands. \u201cWhat knot do you want,\u201d she asked around the fabric.\n\n\u201cThe one a person who isn\u2019t invited recognizes from across a lot of rough water,\u201d Tomas said before Sid could admit he did not know. \u201cThe one that says, I am acting wrong in order to do a right thing.\u201d\n\nBee worked as if she had always known the right kind of wrong. Her fingers twisted and un-twisted. The ribbon became something that was not a bow and not a noose but a message in the shape of caution. She taught the knot to itself twice until it agreed to hold in both directions, then slipped it over Sid\u2019s fingers to feel how it lay. \u201cYou put it on the old canal,\u201d she said. \u201cNot where people look. Where a person who had to leave once might look when they were choosing whether to be brave again or leave again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not leave this thing to bandits,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they wear red scarves or the bones of saints. We keep it in the ledgers if we can and in our mouths if we must.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am keeping it in my vocabulary until it changes me,\u201d Sid said. He could feel the shape of the day already choosing him and could not decide if he was relieved or afraid. \u201cTenorio, if it hums again, tell me whether it asks us to stay or go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bowl and a wound,\u201d Tenorio said. \u201cWounds ask you to clean them and then to leave them alone. Bowls ask to be filled. We will find out which one is hungrier.\u201d\n\nThey drew back to the shade, not out of cowardice but because standing in sun with no plan makes men make bad ones. Marta of Piedra came up the road as if she had sworn the foothills to different manners and they had agreed to humor her. She was a woman with forearms like mortars and a mouth that chewed seeds a lot of the time she wasn\u2019t chewing foolishness. She spat and looked down and chewed again and spat. \u201cThis is not mine,\u201d she said with the kind of authority that made everyone want to give it to her anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s not any mason\u2019s. The lines at the edge are not from drowning in rain. I don\u2019t like it. When I don\u2019t like a thing it means men will run toward it because they want to prove me wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can taste it,\u201d Tomas suggested. \u201cTaste tells a fool what to do when his head is full of fathers.\u201d\n\nMarta crouched. She dipped two fingers in dust and touched them to her tongue. She didn\u2019t wince the way Sid wanted her to. She frowned, which was worse. \u201cThere\u2019s quarry in it. And kiln. And a little bit of burnt bird. And a flavor I don\u2019t have a word for, which makes me dislike my mother because she did not give it to me.\u201d She stood and wiped her hands on her skirt, then kicked the ground the way you kick a door to make certain a friend hears you coming. \u201cIf the stones start moving, we get everyone on the downhill side of trees. The trees will catch what they can\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nSid sent Santi and Bee back down the road with instructions like pieces of honeycomb\u2014sweet enough to carry with complaint built in. Stop at the upper pump and tell them no one draws extra. Stop at Rosales\u2019s cousin\u2019s place and tell him to tether his pigs under the oak, not the fig. I know pigs do as they please but make them please me. Bee, tie this to the old canal at the turn where the dirt has learned to lie. If a woman with a scarf comes, tell her to take off her scarf and wait where the fancy manzanita droops like the beard of a saint who has lost his humor. Do not say her name.\n\n\u201cDo not say her name like she\u2019s a curse,\u201d Bee said. She tied the ribbon into the loop of her belt like a promise. \u201cNames are only curses if you speak them with bad intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr with longing,\u201d Tomas added. \u201cLonging can ruin even a poem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will ruin no poems,\u201d Bee said, and left with Santi, who had a way of making the space around him feel durable that made gods forgive him the things he did not believe.\n\nThe circle\u2019s hum settled to a memory under noon. Heat took over as the main authority. Tenorio sat with his hands on his knees and his head tipped and told Sid stories about the times he had seen earth do something unusual and it had turned out to be small men with large ideas, and then the times he had seen it and it had turned out to be the opposite. Marta muttered to the stones as if complimenting them into complacency. Mateo stood always as if he were about to leave, a man whose home had been burnt out of him and knew it and was honest about the draft.\n\nSid slept badly and briefly, chin on chest, and woke because the air had shifted. It had picked up the smell rain has when it is only a rumor and will stay that way to punish you. The hum came again, lower this time, as if the thing in the bowl had found a different part of its chest with which to think. Birds rose from the oaks on the far ridge all at once as if they had been told a cruel joke. When the hum sank, dust did not. It hung in little columns, then fell as if someone had remembered gravity late.\n\n\u201cMen,\u201d Dolores said in the voice she used for lists when she could not bear to write them down. \u201cWe cannot own this. We can argue with it and make ourselves tired. Or we can help the ones who will be hurt when other men argue with it. I have four carts I can empty by nightfall of wheat we can spare. I will send them to the women in Lower Woodlake because their fences are already failing and whatever this is will make men less generous even if it never opens its eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what it is to be steward,\u201d Tenorio said. \u201cYou count hunger and how it moves and you move faster. You do not make speeches about the way the earth smells.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do many things at once,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cI am a woman and I am tired, so it comes naturally.\u201d\n\nWhen Bee and Santi came back by the lower road, dust to their knees, the knot was gone from Bee\u2019s belt and there was a new shadow in the company of their horses that had not yet decided whether it wanted to be a person or an idea. Eryn walked a pace behind them as if she had been there all along and only now felt like being seen. She had wrapped her hair under a gray cloth and left her throat bare, which felt like a trick until you realized it was also a kind of kindness, because it did not dare you to reach for the scarf that was not there. Her eyes came first and then the rest.\n\n\u201cI tied it as if I loved you,\u201d Bee said to Sid about the ribbon, then to Eryn because she had enough air for two honesties. \u201cAnd you came as if you loved him.\u201d\n\nEryn gave Bee a look that had salt in it and otherwise declined to answer the thing that would have made everything small. She took in the bowl, the people, the way the wind had decided to be a dog and lie down in the shade of the oaks, the men in it, the fear trying hard not to be called that. Her mouth flattened. \u201cI did not put my scarf on because I knew you would think to tie the ribbon and I knew I would make a poor entrance if I had to take it off in front of your men.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would never make a poor entrance,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cEven if you came in on your knees dragging a sack of bad fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done that,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cIt worked. People were too busy smelling me to look to their coin. What is this.\u201d She didn\u2019t put we into it. She wasn\u2019t a fool.\n\n\u201cA bowl and a wound,\u201d Tenorio said. He rose the way old men do when they are called into being by curiosity and politeness at once. \u201cWe are deciding which is hungrier.\u201d\n\nEryn took a step forward as if she had felt the hum under her feet before she heard it. She stopped when it rose and you could see in the set of her body that she knew something about the way you held yourself when sound wanted to push your bones around. Her eyebrows winged up, not with fear, but recognition. \u201cI have heard a church like this,\u201d she said softly. \u201cFar south. The stones had a music when you pressed your ear against them. A woman there told me that everything hums if you love it long enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this wants love the way it hums,\u201d Dolores said, \u201cthen I don\u2019t wish to know the word for its hate.\u201d\n\nEryn\u2019s gaze moved to Sid and skipped his crown as if it were not there, which it was not, and landed on his mouth. He felt himself become the wrong kind of visible. \u201cDo not say the word we both didn\u2019t,\u201d she warned. \u201cI can feel you readying it like a spoon. Don\u2019t feed it your certainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not certain of anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are only a crowd of different fears around a hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and went to the lip the way a person goes to a dock at night to throw stolen bread to fish because it feels like priesting even if God would quibble about the details. She knelt and placed her hand on the glassed earth and closed her eyes. For a horrible moment Sid imagined the hum rising and taking her skin the way fire takes hair and he put his hand on the knife he had removed and found himself with nothing to hold. The hum did rise. She flinched. She did not move away. When it sank, she took her hand back and the part of her palm that had touched the ground shone faintly as if she\u2019d pressed it into a coin.\n\n\u201cThat is not only heat,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a thing I do not have words for, which makes me hungry. You can feel it asking. The way a place that\u2019s about to become a town asks men to name their streets before anyone has built a house. It wants to be called. It wants to stop being a thing that only happens and be a thing that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens when you name a thing like this,\u201d Marta asked. \u201cCarts roll in and men argue about who will pay for the stones. Then a man like me is asked to mark it so that when it tears it will tear along the line they thought they wanted.\u201d\n\nEryn looked up at the oak where Tomas lounged. \u201cSing something,\u201d she demanded. \u201cNothing clever. A work song. A woman washing a shirt. A child being told to sleep. I want to hear the way it moves against the hum.\u201d\n\nTomas glowered like a cat given a bath and then sang. He didn\u2019t have a voice you would put on a square for coins. He had a voice that sounded like rope, notched and trustworthy. He sang a line his mother had sung about soap you make when you are poor and happy with your poverty, and a line his father had sung about mules and bad deals and the way the sky takes the heat and does not return it as a favor, and a line he had made up about his own mouth. The hum threaded through it like a second singer who refused to harmonize and still could not be said to be out of tune. Dust lifted in thin prayer flags. A lizard ran slower than it wished to and then remembered what running was and sped.\n\n\u201cWe can get out of this alive,\u201d Eryn said, and it was the first generous thing she\u2019d said all day. \u201cBut it will tilt everything. The men who want to own it will come. The poets will too, and they are sometimes worse. The women with babies will wonder if the babies\u2019 sleep will change and if it does they will blame and forgive the wrong people for a while. You need to make a law that is an apology and a dare at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can write a law that stumbles toward that,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cBut it will last as long as you and your hum behave. We need something that stands when flour is scarce and when there is too much flour and men grow greedy with bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will write something that says no fires within two fields,\u201d Tenorio said, turning the world into the language he trusted. \u201cYou will write something that says no digging here unless a woman who has put her ear to stones says yes. You will send boys up the old road to stop pilgrims from throwing bottles that break into knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you will send word to the coastal kings,\u201d Ajit\u2019s voice said from behind them, and they all turned, because he had said he would stay and in that way men remind you that promises are elastic when true fear stretches them. He looked embarrassed and not sorry. \u201cI cannot fix a gate if half the men who know the counterweights have gone up into the hills to see a thing that hums. I will send boys if you cannot send men. And you will tell the people by the salt that we are not hoarding a miracle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not calling it that,\u201d Sid said. \u201cWe are calling it a problem that requires singing and rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will call it whatever you like at the courthouse,\u201d Ajit said, arms folded, two missing fingers curled toward his palm as if they were listening still. \u201cIn the market it will be miracle even if it eats a goat for breakfast. We can manage gates. We can\u2019t manage mouths. But we tell them a thing loud and often and some of them will pretend to believe it for a while.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon laid its weight on them like a polite aunt who means to smother. A wind came up and set the oak leaves speaking in their dry consonants. From down the hill a thin river of people began to arrive, the curious and the careful and the ones who had been told to stand here and not there and were midway through deciding what they thought about being told in general. Sid found himself standing always half between the bowl and the people, as if the middle position could translate anything into kindness. He let the pattern of the work take him. Answer a question. Detour a boy who wanted to throw a rock, away not only from the bowl but from the future he would make for himself if no one taught him how not to enjoy breaking. Let an old woman with a needle-box touch his sleeve until she remembered why she\u2019d come. Ask Mateo if he wanted to walk or sit. Send Bee to the canal with the ribbon because even if Eryn stood here now you had to honor the version of her that had not known if she would choose to.\n\nBy sunset the circle had not opened and the hum had come and gone in waves like a stubborn tide. Men had drawn closer than Tenorio liked and been pushed back not by any visible threat but by a feeling in their knees that told them the bones involved in standing were reconsidering their allegiances. Fires had been lit too near and then kicked out with bad language. Laws had been invented and argued. Tomas had sung again and then spoken a story about a fish who wanted to climb a tree and when he got to the part where the fish understood who he was and stopped trying to be anything else a woman cried and pretended it was because smoke had gotten in her eye.\n\nNight made the bowl a shape the eye could not understand. It ate light around its edges. It gave back stars in the center as if something had polished them. The hum, when it came, vibrated the visible world less and climbed instead up into people\u2019s skulls and announced that it could sit there if it wanted. Eryn stood with her hands in the pockets of her cut-down coat and watched the dark as if it were a chessboard full of pieces she had never seen before but was confident she could learn.\n\n\u201cThis is going to call men to themselves,\u201d she said to Sid, when they had contrived a corner of conversation at the margin of shadows. \u201cSome will like who they are. Some will not. The ones who do not will get loud. The ones who do will get quiet and do the work. You need to find those before the other ones start naming the days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I had brought more people who know how to make soup for a crowd,\u201d Sid said. He had cleaned three noses bled by humming and said the right thing twice and the wrong thing once and been forgiven in the way kings are forgiven when the one hearing them is tired. \u201cSoup keeps men from philosophy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoup is philosophy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt says we have heat and time and someone cared enough to stir. It says we are staying at least long enough to eat and that means the world hasn\u2019t ended. Make soup in the yard if you want to stay king.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will send for bags of split peas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd salt that doesn\u2019t taste like it comes with a sermon.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be good at this,\u201d she said, and her mouth made a shape he had not seen yet, a warning that had something kind under it. \u201cIf you are good at this men will start bringing you their holes and ask you to hum for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am tired of being good at anything,\u201d he said, and it was not a king\u2019s truth and because of that it felt like one I-beam in a building not yet decided on.\n\nFrom the bowl came a breath unlike the others, a filling that changed the pitch of the night. The oak leaves froze without wind. A ring of dew showed in a place no dew had any business appearing, and then a line of light ran around the depression like a snake made of an old word that had just remembered itself. Every throat in the company clicked or tightened or swallowed or failed to, depending on its history. The curve they had seen earlier shifted and the dust showed a lattice where another curve lay under it in the opposite direction, and for a second the pattern lifted out of the earth in a way that made men remember why people had bothered inventing gods.\n\n\u201cBack,\u201d Tenorio said, although no one had moved forward. \u201cBack,\u201d he repeated, and they obeyed the old man as men obey a tide table.\n\nSid felt something wanting in him go to its knees and apologize and change. He did not know what it had been wanting to start with. He also did not speak the word Eryn had forbidden him. He kept his mouth at being a human thing and not an altar. The light went out not like a candle but like breath deciding it was done. The hum went low and lower and then away, and the world slid back into its previous wrongness. Someone laughed too loud at nothing and then covered his mouth as if the laugh might draw attention. Someone else prayed in a language Sid did not know and had never heard inside city walls.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Dolores said, which was such an act of faith that Sid had to turn his face away so she would not see what that word did to him. \u201cWe will set the tents here and here. We will send a boy with a back that can be trusted to the salt road. We will choose three words to say at market and not more. We will appoint two people to listen and say no. We will write a sign that uses simple nouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will also go down at first light to the lower farms,\u201d Ajit added, softer. \u201cBecause the men there will take advantage of the city\u2019s eyes pointing uphill. We do not allow men to drink with both hands while they are being watched by God and dragons.\u201d\n\nHe had said it. The word had been said in a way that was almost a joke and not a joke, and it hung for a breath in the night and then became part of it.\n\nEryn looked at Sid, and there was that small, awful, private happiness again that someone else\u2019s mouth knew the same shape your mouth wanted. She touched his elbow, which was not a promise and not permission. \u201cDo not say that in the hall,\u201d she advised. \u201cSave it for here when your mouth is of no consequence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI usually save my worst words for the places where they will do me the least harm,\u201d he said. \u201cI am learning to do the opposite. It seems necessary to both survive and be worth surviving.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d she said, amused and almost fond and furious with herself for both. \u201cTrying to survive and matter at once. It will tire you past your marrow.\u201d\n\nThey kept watch. They made a circle of bodies around the circle of ground. They took turns sleeping on their sides like simple animals. Sid lay with his ear pressed to the earth at one point because something in him wanted to hear the hum the way a child hears a mother through a wall. He heard nothing but the breathing of his men and the shift and creak of oaks and the small astonished noises horses make when they have dreamed. He thought about the year Eryn had asked for and whether that year would mean anything against the shape under the ground. He thought about soup. He thought about tying ribbons to water and learning new knots. He thought about his father saying you can make anything into something else if you hammer long enough and wondered if this would forgive being hammered.\n\nBefore dawn a thin layer of ash had fallen over the lip away from the wind, a thing that looked like snow in a story told by a liar and a mother who wanted to comfort her child. It made footprints sharp. It held a record of the way the raccoons had come, curious and rude, and then left offended in their raccoon way. Sid stood and took a breath and held it as if the day would start when he released. It did not. It started when Bee\u2019s shadow fell long and she said, from beside him where her mouth was too simple to lie. \u201cThere are men on the lower road with salt armor,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a flag with a clam drawn on it in a way that thinks clams are proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoastal,\u201d Dolores said with more punctuation than some essays.\n\n\u201cToo early,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cWe have not decided our words and already they are delivering theirs. They will want to make a harbor out of your bowl. They will want to put their boats in it and call it a blessing even if the boats have no water to float on.\u201d She fixed her scarfless throat with her hand as if to remind it that she still belonged to herself. \u201cWe should go be clever, then. It\u2019s a day for it.\u201d\n\nSid picked up his coat. His boots found their own feet. He felt the copper crown at home on the courthouse windowsill as if it were a small animal he had failed and would have to explain to later. He thought about soup again and about the shape under the earth and the taste of metal and the way Eryn had said his name and made it into something he nearly wanted to be. He squared his shoulders, which was ridiculous because shoulders are not squares, and smiled without showing teeth, which was a practice that had taken him a year to learn and had saved him three times.\n\n\u201cWe will go see,\u201d he said, and this time when he said it there was no one there who needed reminding that this was what he knew how to do. They went down toward the lower road as a small band, into the shadows made by things bigger than they were, and he felt the city behind him and the bowl at his back, and it was like walking away from a lit room that might burn and knowing you would come back no matter what the men with clams thought they could claim by arriving early.They found the coastal men where the lower road swung through a stand of valley oaks that had learned to drink deep and not talk about it. You could smell the sea before you saw them. It was a scent that did not belong to this land: salt dried on skin so many times it became a second hide, tar and old rope and the faint licorice of fennel seeds men chew against nausea. Their armor was white at first glance, but it was not purity; it was salt, cured onto boiled leather until the plates clicked like teeth. The flag with the clam was more elaborate than the countryside deserved, painted in pearl pigment so the creature\u2019s shell threw off little parings of light and its hinge had been shaded by someone who had loved a hinge too much. They had brought a cleric in a blue stole whose God preferred horizons and did not sit well in rooms. They had brought a chest you could smell the coins in even from horseback.\n\nThe leader, whether named that by his men or by himself, came forward with the tall man\u2019s ease of one who sails more than walks and liked being taller than people who worked in dirt. He wore his hair plaited with strips of dried eel that had been worked to shine like leather, and his thumb bore a ring carved from a whalebone\u2019s whorl. \u201cLord Sid of the Copper,\u201d he said, the way you address a neighbor whose dog has started killing your chickens and you intend to be just. \u201cWe were told by the traveling kind\u2014tinker, washer, a woman with a tattoo of a fish on her throat\u2014that a phenomenon of interest has woken in your jurisdiction. Sea laws apply in cases of phenomena. We are obliged to offer assistance and, in return, maintain a share in the naming rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy jurisdiction prefers plows to phenomena,\u201d Sid replied, pleasantly enough to be a danger. He did not give the man his title back. He did not say, I know your sort, gone inland to remind it there is a horizon it does not own. He did not say, you are late, because lateness was sometimes the only manner left to men who had everything else. \u201cAnd the only naming rights that apply belong to the people whose teeth have been humming since yesterday. They would like to be asked before you put your clam on it.\u201d\n\nThe coastal leader\u2019s eyes did what eyes do when a man feels he has been spoken to as an equal by someone he thought needed his pronunciation, narrowing and then opening as if the sun had come out at an awkward time. \u201cWe don\u2019t plant clams,\u201d he said, affront making his vowels saltier. \u201cWe plant banners to warn men not to drown. We are here to prevent. You inlanders are fond of pretending things are not happening until they have met your fence. The sea does not offer fences. It offers advice. Listen, then. If what you have is a vent, we cinch it. If it\u2019s a sink, we measure it, we chart it, we forbid washing clothes in it until we say you may. If it is a saint\u2019s mouth, we build a chapel. We share tithe.\u201d\n\nDolores rode a pace up and cut in with that particular thin politeness that makes men think of paper cuts. \u201cIf it\u2019s a saint\u2019s mouth,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will donate shingles and we will ask the saint if she prefers a roof.\u201d She looked the man\u2019s armor up and down as if pricing it in her head. \u201cIf it is a vent, you dump enough salt on it to kill three fields, and you do not make it as far as the second tree before men who planted those fields cut your elk-leather to feed their children. If it\u2019s a sink, there will be no charts until you learn that a map can scorch a land as efficiently as fire. We have rules already on the road up. You will follow them or you will dine with your clam under the bridge and your men can sing you to sleep.\u201d\n\nEryn had hung back because she made a point of not being a member of anyone\u2019s we unless she agreed to it out loud in the morning light. Now she slid forward until she was where the coastal men could fail to see her by thinking about anything else. Her scarf was gray as cloud on a day when the sea means something and knows you think it does. \u201cYou people,\u201d she said, looking past them at the flag because sometimes you have to speak to a thing that believes it is a person, \u201cbuild churches where something leaks and call it reverence. Then you sell blessing by the scoop. This is not your leak. You can stay if you can be quiet. I doubt you can. But surprise me. That\u2019s a dare you will not resist.\u201d\n\nThe cleric with the blue stole had the sort of face that becomes more itself when someone needs him to be reasonable. He stood with his hands folded so that the ring on his forefinger\u2014the one with the tiny fish engraved on the band, chasing its tail\u2014showed. \u201cWe can bless without owning,\u201d he said, and you could tell he had practiced that sentence in different towns and been met with laughter or prayer according to weather. \u201cWe can stand at a distance and say no words. Sometimes the saying of no words is a blessing. We have an oath for that. It is very short.\u201d\n\nTomas, who had been whittling nothing into the shape of something while leaning against a fencepost that did not need his company, dropped a curl of wood and smiled at the cleric in a way that said you might drink soup with me one day. \u201cI know that oath,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes mmhmm. Can your men mmhmm with salt on their teeth.\u201d\n\nThe coastal leader lifted the band of his flag to avoid a puddle that had been there since January because a broken culvert argued with gravity at that turn and always won. He glanced at the hill as if it had been promised to him across a table. Perhaps it had. The whalebone ring tapped his thigh and made a sound like wooden cutlery in a drawer. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to quarrel with farmers,\u201d he said, and that was a sentence that usually preceded quarrel. \u201cWe want to be recorded in the story as the men who came inland and told you how not to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could start by listening to how we\u2019ve managed that so far,\u201d Sid said. \u201cWe will walk together, and I will tell you what not to do. You will nod and stay behind a rope that a girl tied and you will not laugh because her knots hold like a mother\u2019s. You will not plant your flag in dirt and you will not write any word down until it has been said aloud by a woman who has put her ear to stone. If you can manage these courtesies, we will give you soup. If you cannot, you will eat salt and say it was your intention.\u201d\n\nAjit, who had come despite his promise and was now owning his usefulness the way a man carries a third pail in his teeth and pretends it keeps his mouth from mischief, cleared his throat. \u201cYou want to see this thing,\u201d he told the coastal men. \u201cFine. We\u2019ve gone up twice now and it hasn\u2019t eaten us but it has made our hair stand up like we were boys again. It hums in bone. Your armor will hum, and it will make your men uneasy and they\u2019ll take off pieces and you\u2019ll yell and then they\u2019ll put them back on and start making jokes that spill. If anyone throws anything, I will throw him. I lost two fingers to a chain and I miss them like sons. I will keep all the rest of my fingers by keeping your men alive. You don\u2019t like being spoken to like donkeys. Good. Learn to be loved like them instead.\u201d\n\nThey went together, a river of bad expectations braided with good behavior because men can be surprising when watched by a saint and by bandits and by a king who is trying not to learn new postures of apology. The coastal flag brought down the birds. The cleric hated that. He looked up at the oak with his jaw set and then told his flag man to hang back. The road narrowed where buckbrush piled its green into a barricade, and the salt armor scraped against ceanothus with the sound of winter gravel under municipal boots. It was almost comic if you had never been made to listen to a man fail at grace and call the failure weather.\n\nAt the first rope\u2014Bee\u2019s work, stretched around a stand of scrub and through a pair of wedge-shaped boulders as if it had grown there\u2014Sid stopped and the others did as well because they had the sense to recognize a threshold. Bee had knotted it with an idea inside. The knot did not want you to pass. It wanted you to learn how to ask. Eryn bent to look at it and you could see her pleasure in the way a small, right thing can stand instead of a cannon. \u201cWho taught you this,\u201d she asked Bee without looking away, which is how praise works in places where it has not been cheapened.\n\n\u201cA woman who ran away and ran back,\u201d Bee said. \u201cShe told me you tie like this when you want to let someone think they found the way on their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour teacher was a liar who loved you,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cBetter than most teachers.\u201d She straightened and tapped the rope with her knuckles. \u201cThe rule says what it says. You stay behind this. You can see from here. No, old man, it won\u2019t be enough for you,\u201d she added to the coastal leader, whose eyes had placed a flag a long time ago and were now negotiating with his mouth about how to praise the view while thinking of nails. \u201cBut it will keep you civil while you come up with flattery that sounds like a treaty.\u201d\n\nThey stood in a new geometry. The bowl lay ahead wearing late morning like a shawl someone had left on its shoulders and then been too afraid to go back for. Tenorio sat again with his ear turned, a weather vane made of expectation and tendon. Marta of Piedra had arranged three stones by her knee as a model of what she wanted the bigger stones to consider, and was explaining to them in patient detail how not to disgrace themselves when the hum came, because if she treated them like men some of them might endeavor to be like better ones. The coastal men spread out along the line that had been drawn for them by a girl, and it did something to them that years of discipline had not achieved. It made them humble by telling them it was a choice.\n\nThe hum rose like steam finds a gap in a lid. Sid had prepared himself for it in the way you prepare for a slap now that you love the person who has always been the one to deliver it. He kept his mouth shut and still. The coastal men failed and got better on the second breath. Armor shivered. A ring of dew rose again where no dew belonged and the cleric made a sound of disobedient awe he would later call unseemly and blame on the dryness. The curve showed itself and then the under-curve and in that doubling something like a lattice unrolled in the dust and went away, and the coastal leader took one half-step without meaning to. The rope held. He did not push it. He did not call for his flag. He cursed, in a manner that would have pleased any inland grandmother; it was clean and admitted the man\u2019s mother would be disappointed.\n\n\u201cWhat will you name that,\u201d the cleric whispered, forgetting that he had insisted on no words as blessing. \u201cWhat name fits without running over its edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone you brought,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cNone you rode in with. You have sea words and church words and words for spices traded by men who think a market is a war you can win with a list. None of those will lie properly against this shape. If you wait till it speaks in something like sense, you will earn a syllable. If you jump and plant your clam, we will take it away from you, politely, the way a woman takes glass out of a child\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\nTomas took the cleric\u2019s blue stole in two fingers and moved it one inch away from the fringe of the rope where it had been about to trespass. \u201cYou pray,\u201d he advised, unnecessarily and exactly. \u201cNot to it. Not for it. In spite of it. To keep your own song steady while this one tries to climb inside your head and conduct.\u201d\n\nDolores had produced from nowhere a slate and on it she had written three sentences, each in words as short as her patience and twice as durable. No fire. No going past rope. No digging by anyone until a stone-listener says yes. She had a chalk nub that left dust on her fingertips and she wiped the dust on her skirt and the white streaks there were as fair as lace to her. She told a boy to take the slate to the lower crossing and she told a girl to take it to the upper and she told both that if anyone laughed at their size they should invent a new curse and use it twice, once for practice and once for conviction.\n\nThe coastal leader looked at Sid with the face of a man who admits to himself that a morning has gone another way than he dreamed it and still intends to sleep well later. \u201cWe will not plant a flag,\u201d he said, the words not pleasing him as they came out and therefore proving they were the right ones. \u201cWe will stand behind the girl\u2019s rope and we will watch a while. We will send a letter with your man to our city and ask for stones that can listen, if you allow that, and men who do not insult the inlanders\u2019 air by breathing it like the last of something. We will leave our cleric in your keeping so you can see we mean it. He is not a hostage. He is a witness, which is worse if a man knows what a witness can do.\u201d\n\nSid allowed the least smile. It was the one that said good, I have not had to lie yet, and perhaps today I will sleep in my own bed next to the sound of something not singing. \u201cLeave your cleric if he likes our soup,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will mean more to me than your letter. We will share watch and notes. But you will not name things at market. You will not tell men who sell beans that this will bring back the sea. If you do, I will come to your coast and I will sell almonds and call them pearls and I will embarrass you so thoroughly your whalebones will blush.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s whalebone ring tapped his thigh again as if it had an opinion and was trying to introduce it. He exhaled. \u201cI am Lord Baeza of the Tidemark,\u201d he said, as if giving his name was a concession and an admission and an offering. \u201cIf your soup is brined like the last time I ate in this valley, I will insult you in return by teaching your cook to use salt with grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoup is already boiling in the upper shade,\u201d Bee reported over her shoulder, as if this had been the plan all month. \u201cSplit peas and a ham joint and a handful of that green that grows where it shouldn\u2019t. Two onions. No sermons in the salt. If you don\u2019t like it there is bread. If you don\u2019t like the bread you can go chew your banner.\u201d\n\nMarta had set three cauldrons on stones and announced the law of the soup as if it had been handed down to Moses in the dust: a ladle is a ruler and you do not let any man measure himself longer than anyone else with it. Ajit had wheedled two goatskins of extra water from the upper pump by saying he would name his next son after the spring. The women from Lower Woodlake had come with turnips and grief and were tending both in the same way, slow and stirring. When Lord Baeza tasted the soup he made the face of a man who has discovered his prejudice is not only foolish but a joke passed around avidly by the people he had thought to impress. He nodded. The cleric\u2019s mouth softened into the shape that means this is not the worst place God ever invented and perhaps He knew what He was doing when He put the river here.\n\n\u201cWrite your letter,\u201d Dolores told Lord Baeza, because she was disinclined to let a man feel good for long without asking him to work. \u201cSay you watched a hole refuse your flag and thought about your mother. Tell them not to send a bell tower. Tell them to send rope, thirty coils, and men who will not piss near oak. We have our own piss. We don\u2019t need yours dressing up as aid.\u201d She had her ledger out without seeming to and took down what she was owed in a neat hand that had frightened men into paying debts their grandfathers had stolen.\n\nWhile men learned obedience to a girl\u2019s rope and while soup became the philosophy of a crowd, Sid stood with Eryn under the lower oak where the ground still remembered the feet of a particular boy who had hid there with pears and a knife to carve his name into them so that when he ate he would also have taken a little of himself into himself. He had the ribbon Bee had tied in his mind and the knot had become a way of thinking. \u201cYou came when I asked,\u201d he said, which is an accusation in a thousand small countries because it reveals the ask was heard.\n\nShe adjusted the cuff of her coat with an attention that had saved her life more than once. \u201cI came because I don\u2019t like losing the ability to surprise myself. I also came because men with salt in their ears are loud and you needed a woman in gray to stand to your left and make this look like more than farmers trying dignity on. Do not write me into your ledger as a kindness.\u201d She tilted her head toward the bowl where the hum had gone quiet as if exhausted by introducing itself. \u201cI sent two of mine up the north slope last night, past Piedra and on toward the old jam factory. They heard another song. Not the same note. A different jaw.\u201d Her mouth made a shape she lent only to true confession. \u201cIf this is a mouth, it is part of a set. If this is a wound, it was made with a tool that likes to work in pairs.\u201d\n\nHe watched her face while she said it and could not decide if he was glad to discover that fear had a shape he could hold or if he was being handed a map without creeks. \u201cSecond,\u201d he said. The word sat in the air like a brick waiting to become a corner. \u201cThen the law we make today will be tested tomorrow by men who don\u2019t like waiting twice for anything. Then we need more rope, more soup, more jokes, more ways to say no without making it a war.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps also more beds that are not for sleep,\u201d she said, deliberate and then not, because she had not meant to say it and needed him to know this was the part of her that said true things when she was bone-tired. \u201cBecause tired men become greedy for absolutes. If you avert two fights with a woman\u2019s mouth or a man\u2019s hand that has nothing to do with knives, you save a life. Put your jester in charge of the quiet corners. Make him hand out threads for people to braid so their hands will not want to throw.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make Tomas a priest of making the middle bearable,\u201d Sid said. He did not let the image bloom and take his day. He kept it folded, like a letter you do not read again because the first time did something to your chest. \u201cCan you go north and come back before night makes the world lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can go north and come back if the world keeps its current bargains,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cThe world owes me little. But I can collect on small debts. I will send a boy with a ribbon if I find a second bowl and he will tie it to the old gate at Piedra at the notch where you can\u2019t see it unless you work with your hands. If I don\u2019t send him, assume I am taking on work that has me for supper.\u201d She touched her fingers to his shoulder and took them away again because she had learned that sometimes the body doesn\u2019t know how to stop asking. \u201cDo not make a speech,\u201d she advised. \u201cMen remember the wrong sentences. Simply say we are not naming anything until it tells us its name and then show them you can hold your tongue in your teeth. If you bleed a little from doing it, so much the better. People believe blood.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask her what to name the second note if it was a jaw and how many jaws these hills could host before the city below them became one long mouth laughing itself into ruin. He wanted to tell her about his father cursing the water for being exactly as it should be, which is to say, without pity, and how he had inherited that kind of love and was trying to dress it in mercy. He wanted, which was becoming a real thing he had to reckon with, to put the ribbon she had not worn into her hair himself and be content with that action, small and ceremonial and useless against geology. He said instead, \u201cNo speeches. Soup. Rope. Girls who tie better than kings hold. That is my plan and I will lie to no one about the parts of it that are luck.\u201d\n\nBy late afternoon the coastal men had learned to keep their weight back from the rope as if it could bite. The cleric had managed three mmhmms with grace and without performing sanctity for an audience; it made Sid look at him with the particular suspicion he reserved for decent men. Lord Baeza had taken his salt ring off for a while, because the hum made it ache in a way he would be embarrassed to describe to anyone, and he had hidden it in his pocket like an unwise letter. He had also taken a second bowl of soup and smiled at Bee with unwilling brotherhood after she salted it with a pinch from a horn she kept tucked in her boot. Tenorio had coaxed two shepherds into admitting what they had heard last winter near Piedra that they had not repeated because it had been the sort of noise you felt foolish connecting to anything. Marta had measured the slope with a string, a pebble, and patience, and drawn a triangle in the dust that made young men admire math.\n\nThen the hum changed. It came low and then lower, and then another note rose, not harmony, not discord, but intersection. It came from the north. It came from a place that had not yet been asked to behave. Birds did the wrong thing in the wrong order. A coyote appeared on the ridge like an illustration of an idea and sat down and wove its ears in a figure eight and looked affronted at a world it had been counting on to be consistent. Men looked at each other the way men do when someone has suggested doing a dangerous thing together and their spines all try to leap up inside their skin in excitement and dread.\n\nEryn was already moving. She had not brought her mare into the first bowl because she had not been asked to and because there were promises made this morning she intended to honor at least until she had to break them. Now she whistled a note that came not from her throat but from the part of her mouth that had taught itself to be bird and thief and woman and girl. The gray mare came from behind a stand of willow where Santi had been trying to make a friend and failed because the mare did not think much of friendship in the middle of a crowd. Eryn put a hand to the horse\u2019s neck and the animal put her head down to the knee and stood for the rope as if it had learned rope language and understood it was a treaty. She did not look back at Sid as she mounted. That would have made the thing sentimental and therefore less likely to end in survival. She looked ahead, and the mare shared her attention respectfully. She said a word that was not a name but would answer like one, and they went.\n\n\u201cNorth,\u201d Sid said, not to no one, never to no one, because he had learned that kings who said things to no one were unwell. \u201cTomas, take Bee and Santi and Marta as far as the second bend and make a gate out of brush so the men who cannot stand not being first will find it hard to ruin themselves. Ajit, stand at the road and tell the next person who arrives that they have to hold someone\u2019s hand before they can see anything and if they argue make them hold yours. They will learn humility and perhaps something about the worth of missing fingers. Dolores, I will write your name on a board so the boys we send to Woodlake can say something that sounds like law when they run with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will sit and drink water,\u201d Dolores said, because a steward\u2019s job is to put water into the hands of whatever idiot is about to make the right decision at great cost. She thrust a skin at him that she had tied with Bee\u2019s knot. He took it and tied it back to himself, and that loop across his shoulder felt like belonging and a collar and like every promise he had not known he made and would try to keep.\n\nThey could not leave the first bowl to go to the second without deciding what to call it in their mouths. They agreed on almost nothing except one thing, and that was that they would not teach it a name yet. The cleric wrote the not-name on his hand in invisible ink. Lord Baeza placed his ring back on and said a thing in his own language that had no vowels and made Ajit smile despite himself. Tenorio patted the ground as if he approved it for temporary occupation by idiots. Sid turned his face north and did not think about all the parts of him he was leaving on the hill tied to knots and ledgers and soup pots and men who thought they knew what a clam could do.\n\nThe lower road made a bend that had taught a thousand carts to be careful or to become stories. When they reached it, Bee and Tomas and Marta and Santi took apart a fence and wove it with brush into a gate that looked like it had been there all along and would only move for the hands of people who understood it, which is to say, people who would survive the next hour. They left two boys at it with hard candy and the authority of having been spoken to by Dolores. Meanwhile, Sid and a smaller group went on at a pace that made the horses lift their heads and remember they used to run for fun when they were wild and unshod. The light, this late, had an orange opinion about how far they should get and when they should turn back, and he ignored it because the note was still in his teeth and had to be investigated.\n\nThey found the second place before they saw it. It had the smell of old iron in rain even without rain. The grass had crouched, not laid down, as if expecting to be beaten without reason. The sound, when it came, was thinner, younger, a filament instead of a rope, and yet it threaded a man\u2019s knees into his jaw exactly as efficiently. Eryn stood on a low rock with her mare\u2019s rein in her hand and her head turned as if listening with the back of her neck. She glanced at Sid like a thief checking whether a boy would hold water in a paper bucket. He would.\n\nThis bowl was shallower; a dent, a cupping palm, not a mouth. The glass at the edges was not ironed as smoothly as the first; it was blistered, as if something had tried to come up and then forgot why. In the center, there was no curve. There was a straight piece of something black as any come-up-from-fire thing counts as black. It was not wood. It was not stone. It had edges like a tool and a skin like a secret.\n\n\u201cJaw,\u201d Tomas said under his breath, because fools name things quietly where kings refuse to.\n\n\u201cSpare your labels,\u201d Eryn said, but without any real heat left in her, because the word had a way of thinking itself into a man\u2019s mouth whether or not his better mind wanted it to.\n\nDolores arrived with a pencil that had been whittled down to resentment and a slate that had not. She began herself to write the same three rules and then added a fourth that made even the cleric nod without irony: No names until the hum says yes. She underlined it because underlining made men stop and squint and therefore gave them time to improve.\n\nNight wanted them back at the first bowl where the soup smelled like a town doing its best. The second bowl wanted them to make a second camp and divide their company and their attention and their claims. Eryn said, as if she had not thought about it until three seconds ago and of course she had, \u201cI will stay here with two of mine and Santi if he will. Bee goes back to feed people and sleep and tell jokes badly. Your jester stays where he can be seen because he keeps men from lighting fires just to see a glow. Your old man who listens to stone will split himself into advice and send some here with me and keep some for you and then sleep on his side so his ear is on the good earth. You, Sid, go back and be seen going back. People stay sensible when they can visualize a king\u2019s posture.\u201d\n\nHe considered refusing. He considered it as a petty thing and a large, stubborn, boyish thing. He let it go because he had enough stubborn in him for the part where he had to tell Lord Baeza to keep his flag rolled. He put his hand on Eryn\u2019s forearm just a little lower than most men would, in the place that means I know you can break this limb and take my life with it if you think I will become a story you cannot stand. \u201cIf anything hums wrong,\u201d he said, which was meaningless and therefore useful, \u201cwhistle the way you did for the mare. I will hear it in my teeth.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cDo not love me by being useful at unuseful distances,\u201d which was cruel and kind and more honest than she owed him, and made a shape with her mouth that was almost a blessing and then wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe stars came up as if mocked by the glass they had to compete with and tried hard and succeeded because stars are patient and hold grudges well. The valley down below made its noises and could not be coaxed into silence; there were parties and fights and births and one marriage that had been on again off again for three years and had decided now was as good a time as any for another try. The first bowl glowed in minds as people fell asleep. The second bowl did the same in the throats of those who hadn\u2019t seen it yet; that was a particular cruelty, to dream of shapes you didn\u2019t know and wake up knowing too much.\n\nSid walked back in the dark with Bee half-asleep on her horse and Tomas telling the low version of a joke to keep coyotes and men who wanted to be coyotes from thinking they owned the path. Ajit matched his stride, and the missing fingers were quiet. \u201cTwo,\u201d Ajit said finally, not because it needed saying but because sometimes a word stops two men from becoming statues. \u201cWe have two. We\u2019ll have a third. That\u2019s the way of things, like gates. They go in threes because men flatter themselves they invent symmetry.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet it not be a third,\u201d Sid said, but without asking gods to intervene because he had already asked them to notice too much today. \u201cLet it be the other half of a jaw if it must, and then a rest and an apology. We will not manage a third. We will manage two because we are already failing at managing one and we have proven ourselves capable of arithmetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will sleep,\u201d Ajit insisted, which he had no right to do and all the right. \u201cYou will put your head down in the room that makes you think of both your parents and you will not dream of edges. If you wake, you will not go to the window. You will go to your table and you will try to write a word for this and your pencil will break and you will take that as a sign and you will go back to bed. In the morning you will convene people and make a law that has soup in it. Put soup into law and you will cut arrests by a third.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoup is an expensive statute,\u201d Sid said, and then, because he had learned to be grateful when his friends made his mouth find jokes after a day that could have drowned it, \u201cWe will write it in the ledgers in the ink that doesn\u2019t run when a man cries into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse the old ink,\u201d Ajit said. \u201cThe cheap that stains everything.\u201d He blew out a breath through pursed lips and made a tune of it that Tomas took up with a hum not unlike the bowl\u2019s smallest moment. \u201cTwo,\u201d he repeated, and this time it had become a plan rather than a counting.\n\nBy the time they reached the yard under the tower the soup was down to thick edges and the last of it stuck to the side of the cauldron the way childhood sticks to a man who didn\u2019t mean to carry it. Lord Baeza had not left. He had taken off his armor as far as decency could bear and was sitting with a woman from Lower Woodlake who was telling him a story about her son that contained no lesson he could use and would nevertheless alter how he spoke to men with blue stoles for a month. The cleric had found Tomas and the two of them had invented a game with pebbles and a circle and a lie, and they were cheating each other so elegantly that men who had been prepared to distrust both found themselves charmed and annoyed into a kind of peace.\n\nDolores put her hand on Sid\u2019s wrist and squeezed once because an agreement had been made that they would not startle each other in public with anything like tenderness. \u201cIn the morning,\u201d she said, \u201cwe tell men where to stand. We tell them what not to call it. We tell them that if they throw anything in, we will throw them in, and we say it like a jest so the ones who need to laugh can laugh and the ones who need to be afraid can find that in it. We tell them soup is law. Then you will sit and listen and say no three times and yes once, and then we will go to the second place and begin again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will also find a quiet corner for men who would otherwise make trouble,\u201d Sid said. \u201cTomas, you are now the master of misdirection. You will lay out cloth and thread and the bones children like to string on cords, and you will say you are teaching men to make offerings because it will make them feel holy and therefore decent for twenty minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always been a priest,\u201d Tomas said, not bothering to rise to the bait because he knew his collar was a laugh. \u201cOf the middle. Of the place between jokes and tears. Bring me old women with needles and young boys with pocketknives. I will save your law more effectively than anything written. I will even bless the salt man if he gives me a decent shell to hold candies.\u201d\n\nLord Baeza raised his shell as if toasting from a distance without the sin of toasting with water. \u201cI have a clam for you,\u201d he said, and smiled a smile that would be a good one if he earned it. \u201cPerhaps, wilderness willing, this place will not make me a worse man. That is more than I expected when I got up this morning and put my salt on.\u201d\n\nSid would sleep. He would be loved improperly by the air that came through his window carrying dust and the talk of his city, and he would pretend not to listen to his own bones. In the courtyard, a boy finished washing the ladle because he had discovered that being the last to touch a thing made him important. In the north, under oaks, Eryn wrapped her scarf around her arm because she had no scarf about her throat and slept with one hand on the mare\u2019s rein and one on dirt that had decided to behave for the next four hours. In the first bowl the glass cooled by a thought. In the second bowl something that was not stone learned the geography of waiting.\n\nWhen the sun pulled itself up on Fresno\u2019s chosen hooks, the men with white armor were already lined at the rope, the lemon light on their plates making them look like pastries left to harden. The city woke with its usual shouting and began to add a new sound to it, not yet a word, certainly not a name, but a syllable of the sort that becomes both, a sound that could be described as mmhmm if you had no poetry and as agreement if you were in love. Sid drank the water Dolores forced on him and then he went under the fig-painted crenels to say the three sentences in the simple nouns he and his steward had chosen and the one he had made for himself: we will go see. He said them without speechifying, without lifting his chin more than a man lifts it to make his voice carry, without any word that would make a wrapper for his fear. People listened because they were tired from a night of hearing a thing that was older than them pretend to be born. Then the day ran, because days do, and the law of soup did its secret work, and knots held men and their appetites, and the bowls sung as bowls teach a place to stand, and somewhere in the pairs of hum and reply a word began to grow that would not be trolleyed into market or written into ledger until it was ready, and that would be the reason people would say later that this was the moment when Fresno learned to keep its mouth and its wonder both, and that was how you survive a season in which dragons are a rumor and a habit.Chapter Seven\n\nThe morning took hold with both hands, and Fresno, who had learned to rise whether begged or bellowed at, rose under a sky the color of old denim worked soft by years of washing. Sid stood under the crenels where the royal blue peeled away in the shapes he named, wind tugging the brim of the woven hat he wore instead of copper, and he spoke the three sentences he and Dolores had scraped down to bone. No fire near the bowls. No going past rope tied by a child of this city. No digging until a stone-listener says the word that is not yet yes. He added the one sentence that was his and would be, he hoped, the kind that clung: we will not name a thing until it tells us its name. He said we will go see after, not as a flourish but as habit, and the people below in the market, who knew the taste of habit, let it settle on their tongues and found it acceptable. Someone in the back laughed at a child\u2019s hat falling down over ears; someone else lifted a basket into shadow; a woman with her sleeves pushed to the elbow wiped her hands on an apron and nodded because this was not the worst set of orders she\u2019d heard paired with dawn.\n\nDolores had already split chalk and slate into a dozen small edicts and put them under the arms of boys who had been taught by mothers to run without testing the leashes of their lungs. She had taken Bee\u2019s words and Ajit\u2019s cautions and Tenorio\u2019s lore and made them walkable. There were three boards at the lower crossing and two at the upper, one nailed by Marta to a post that had outlived many signs and thought itself immortal. She had written the letters large and plain, and then she had made the children who carried them recite the rules until their mouths knew the shape better than a prayer. She sent the smallest boy with an old tin bell and told him where to ring it and where not to, and when he forgot, because small boys will, the rope Bee had tied kept his forgetting from becoming a tragedy. Between errands she required bread from a baker who had never been asked for anything without someone offering coins and who was surprised to find that being requisitioned by name and smile was a kind of currency he could accept.\n\nTomas laid out his cloth in the yard as if it were a map people might want to walk into. He had thread in colors acquired by methods no one wished to inspect, bones polished by fingers and river both, crackers wrapped in paper to bribe men into sitting awhile, and a bowl of buttons that had disagreed with their jackets. He told a boy with teeth like corn to string blue with black until his hands forgot to itch for stones to throw. He told a woman whose laugh had made winter bearable for three men to teach a half-dozen strangers how to braid a good rope, and when someone asked him what this had to do with dragons, he said, with sacred seriousness, that this had to do with the part of a day you spend not making enemies. He had a line of men pretending not to be waiting to sit by midmorning, each with a story they would not tell and a string they would.\n\nLord Baeza wrote his letter sitting on a spool of old cable that had pretensions to thronehood. He had a steady script, as if seas taught steadiness alongside sickness, and he told the Tidemark that the inland had grown a hum. He explained, in words that had the taste of his pride in them, that a girl\u2019s knot made a better border than salt if men agreed to feel it. He requested rope, not banners, and two men with ears worth their keep rather than a cavalcade. He did not mention that the soup had been good, but when the cleric with the blue stole leaned over to read and saw that omission, he tapped the line where the word might belong and Baeza sighed and added, by the way, their soup is not an offense to our name. Ajit brought him a cup of water and a piece of advice about inland rules wearing grudges, and Baeza surprised himself by saying thank you as if the road were a room he wished to be invited into again.\n\nTenorio found a child who would listen. She was eight and called Luz by a grandmother who had known the taste of light after the Breakage, and she had a way of standing that told a man she annexed information without paying full tax. He gave her a shallow pan filled with dirt from three places and a drum head stretched tight over a hoop that had once held a barrel of oil. He let a few grains fall on the drum and then hummed soft and she saw the grains walk, saw the pattern his voice made, saw that the pattern was different when he shifted his throat. He did not tell her she had learned a word. He told her she had learned how to spell an old word with new dust. Luz considered him solemnly and told him that if the earth was going to sing then the people should learn to harmonize instead of shouting. He nodded as if he had been waiting all morning for someone to say that so he could rest.\n\nUp at the second bowl Eryn stood with the gray mare\u2019s rein looped over a rock and Santi at her shoulder like an agreement he hadn\u2019t wanted and decided to honor anyway. She had two of hers in the scrub\u2014Lark with the quick hands and the sorrow he wore lightly, and Pina, whose smile was a tricky thing that had bought them time in three towns and nearly got them killed in a fourth. Eryn had wrapped the gray scarf around her bared head this time because the sun had decided to practice cruelty before noon, and she had wound the tail of it around her wrist in a knot that would let her pull it loose if someone tried to use it to make her obey. The hum here was thinner, a wire strung across a canyon as yet unnamed. It came up through her spine and made her teeth want to confess and then apologize for confessing. Santi stood as he had stood beside his wife\u2019s body the day he had learned widowhood as a word that didn\u2019t know him and made itself known anyway, with his hands quiet and obedient and his face giving nothing but a willingness to weather.\n\nThey walked the rim the way you walk the edge of a conversation you do not trust, looking for the places where language thins. The black straight piece in the bowl was not a root, not a pipe, not a blade as Eryn\u2019s knife-hand wished to call it for the satisfaction of knowing how to resist it. It did not take light. It accepted it. Eryn put her palm to a shard of glassed dirt and then took it away with a hiss, not of pain but of insult; the earth did not usually mind being touched by her and today it had decided it had preferences. Pina, who had been a weaver before the Breakage took her loom and traded it for two goats and a man\u2019s temper, crouched and studied the long edge of the black. She whispered that if you ran your eyes along it quick and then slower you could feel it sit in two times at once, which was a nonsense that nobody laughed at on the lip of a bowl.\n\nDown in the city a deputation from the Fig Guild came to the courthouse with fruit in hand and grievance in mouth. They brought a crate of the first bruised sweetness and offered it like a bribe to the idea of fairness. They complained that ropes were a fashion that would cost them dearly because knots meant delays and delays meant birds with audacity; they claimed that soup was all well and good until it took a bag of beans that could have been planted instead of boiled. Dolores listened as a woman listens when she has a child on her lap and a ledger in her head and a lock to her left and a jar of pickles that is not for today on the shelf above her. She assured them that soup could be made from ends and bones and not from their profits and that the ropes were there because men liked to run toward holes as if a hole would make them full. Ajit arrived with a bag of split peas in one hand and a cypress sprig in the other and told the fig men that if they sent boys to the bowls with ladders he would use those ladders to fix their broken culverts and in the evening he would sit on their porch and count with them how many gallons had been saved. They looked at Sid to see if he would be the kind of king who bowed to fruit, and he smiled at the figs because they had fed him as a boy and said, dignities will be met with dignities, and when you are right, Dolores tells me, and when you are wrong, she tells me louder.\n\nIn Market Lane a man named Esteban of Coppergate sold vials of soot as suckle-ash taken from the dragon\u2019s breath and promised it would make hens lay and wives forgive. Tomas bought one and opened it and smelled it and declared it to be stove. Ajit, who had spent the dawn freeing a jammed gate with his remaining fingers and a dictionary of curses he had acquired from seven cultures, pinched a bit of the ash between thumb and forefinger and smudged it on his wrist where the old burn lay and said without drama that dragon ash would not make a gaiter stain like that. He fined Esteban a morning\u2019s worth of hauling water to the soup pots and gave his soot vials to a boy who would make a fine ink with them if he was given the chance. Esteban argued until Tomas whispered to him a better business: little jars of market dust to keep in a pocket and remember belonging when a man had to walk away for a while. Esteban did not thank him, but later he left a jar with a cork tied by a ribbon near the cloth where Tomas sat, and Tomas took it and looked at it as if it were the neatest idea in ten days.\n\nBee ran the old canal like a girl who was learning the gravity of being trusted and enjoying every part of it. She tied ribbon at the turn where dirt learned to lie and at the crack in the gate post that looked like a man\u2019s face and at the fence line where the neighbor\u2019s wife had a habit of hanging laundry with pins made from apple wood. At the last she met a boy with calves like bent nails and a mouth that had not given up yet on being kind by accident. His name was Ivo, which sounded like an oath and a promise both. He was trying to slip the rope and prove something to his taller cousins, and Bee caught him not by the arm but by the word. She told him to help her tie instead and he did, and after an hour he had decided that ropes were better than daring because they let daring have a yard to romp in without getting cut by glass. He took the piece of ribbon she gave him as if it was a responsibility, which is a phenomenon you cannot sell in vials.\n\nAt the first bowl, not long after noon, a man too warmed by the common courage of soups and jokes tried to throw a stone because temptation is a muscle you must bruise early. The rope tugged his hips forward gently at first, like a mother pulling a child back from the curb, and then harder, because he insisted. It looked like a magician\u2019s trick; it was a knot that Bee had taught with a glare. Tenorio told a story from his chair, not loud and not long, about a hill that had eaten a wagon wheel because the wheel had been pointing in the wrong direction for a century and was tired. The man sat down and unlearned the itch in his arm without being scolded. The cleric built a moment of silence with his mmhmm and the young ones around him mimicked it because it felt like power without shouting and that was rare enough to be a novelty. For a little while the place was a classroom men had made for themselves without anyone in it owning chalk.\n\nAt the second bowl toward evening Eryn felt a new kind of breath come through the ground. It did not push. It asked. The birds did not fall out of it; they hesitated in it. The black straight thing in the center did not lift but it made its edges known to the dust and the dust, civilized by the lesson, arranged itself along lines Eryn could recognize by the face she made when she saw men put their knives in order instead of leaving them like bones thrown to dogs. She forbade Santi\u2019s hand without looking. He had been thinking of touching. His fingers stopped. Lark\u2019s mouth formed a word he did not speak because on some days the hum taught him his own name too loudly. Eryn let the wanting-to-know go through her and not out, which is what you have to do when you want to live long enough to find out anything of worth. She pulled the gray scarf twice tight around her wrist to remind herself she was still attached to this day and not some other.\n\nBy the time the message reached Sid it was a knot on a rope with an extra twist in it Bee had invented for urgency and trust. It had been tied by Pina and carried by Pico, a boy from the slope who could run a hill like a breath taken correctly. He did not come into the hall; he left the knot on the old gate by the plow wheel where Dolores had told him anything tied would be treated as a summons. Sid found it between a levy calculation and a kindness he had intended to pay and kept forgetting. He untied it and read it with his fingers the way men learn to read rope when letters feel like ceremonies for other people. Eryn was staying. The second bowl had shifted the way a sleeper shifts without waking. It wanted witness, not interruption. Pico had added a twist of his own that meant hunger, and Sid smiled because that was the part of this any king could fix.\n\nWhat he could not fix arrived with bells no one had asked for. They were not coastal bells. They were Dust Monks, who were not monks in any rigorous sense except that they preferred to love from a distance and then come closer with bowls. They wore robes washed thin by sand, carried mirrors framed in cracked wood, and sang a low chant that had learned a folk song on a long road and refused to leave it. They wanted to see the hum to decide if it was the kind of hum their founder had meant when he\u2019d said the earth would one day speak because it was tired of men saying it wrong. They wanted to hold their mirrors up to the bowl to see if humility could be reflected and they wanted to call it a lesson if it could not. Dolores met them at the rope with a ledger and a smile that had no blood in it, because her job on days when men thought themselves holy was to pour sand on their sparks until they thought themselves useful. She told them no mirrors inside the rope because mirrors make small suns and they weren\u2019t in the business of building new ones. The leader of the group, a woman called Sister Vero because she did not lie and made you wish you hadn\u2019t either, asked if she could sit close and say nothing. Tenorio permitted it as he would permit a neighbor\u2019s gourd in his garden if the neighbor promised to pick it when it was ripe.\n\nBy late afternoon a rumor of a man Eryn did not love more than policy arrived at the second bowl. He rode a bay with a tail that had been cut for practicality and spite and wore three rings in his left ear that had never healed properly and so bled when he was angry. His name was Gavino and he was the sort of thief who thought waiting his turn made him weak. He had been a friend to nothing that could not be folded into his pocket and passed off as being a poem. He smiled at Eryn with the teeth of a little fish that has survived by never attempting to be bigger. He informed her that he and his would be lowering pigs into the hole morning after next, to prove it was a saint\u2019s mouth and therefore their parish\u2019s business. Eryn did not take her knife out because she had decided this hour to not give a man the dignity of a threat. She offered him soup which he refused because the spoon was in her hand and not his. She advised him in front of Santi\u2019s patient eyes that lowering pigs is a quick way to learn the phrase no one comes to your funeral. He told her to come see him when she had grown out of courtesy and rode away with his ear bleeding from the pressure of his temper on his rings.\n\nSid called a hearing under the north oak at twilight when heat had loosened its grip enough to be ashamed of itself. He did not sit on the plow throne; he stood with one hand on the oldest scar in the bark and the other on Rosales\u2019s knife because that combination of the old and the sharp made him feel constructed correctly. Representatives came because names give men reasons to say they deserve to, and they said them. Fig Guild. Sheep. Salt. Dust. Stone-listeners. The women who keep graves. The three old men who sang on Wednesdays and had come to accept that no verdict was complete without them harmonizing at the end. He made a new oath that would be called a small thing later when people who had not been there wanted to feel larger. He said that any rope tied by a child of Fresno was law where law might otherwise not exist, and that to untie it without permission would cost a week of carrying water and a day of sweeping the courtyard and a night of singing until your throat remembered you had a body. He made soup an instrument, not of order, but of intention, and that is what instruments are, and he wrote it down with the cheap ink Ajit swore by so the words bled into the page and would not look neat when the page got wet. He asked Tenorio and Marta to make of their listening a guild and offer apprenticeships paid in bread and glory, and both said they preferred glory to come later. He affirmed the coastal men a place at the rope and took from them the right to speak to market about anything but what soups they had tasted. He did not say Eryn\u2019s name and everyone he loved knew it and did not make him pay for it publicly.\n\nAt dawn the next day he learned what tremors meant when they did not end where you could see them. The gate at Walnut Skew shuddered and Ajit caught the chain with what fingers he had and dragged it into obedience while swearing he would have a fourth and fifth son to name after this day and he was not in the business of sons. The bowls answered each other like voices across a house, not singing yet but trying out sound as a method of affection or warning. The hum rolled under the city and shook a cupboard in a woman\u2019s kitchen so that her cups clinked and she decided to forgive her neighbor a debt simply because she liked the singing of it. Tenorio stood in the yard and turned slow and pointed his chin east and said it was rolling that way, which meant the next moment would have a choice to make. Lord Baeza, who had sailed through weather that tore sails like confessions, said under his breath that this was a tide inside the land, which made Ajit look at him and smile like a man recognizing a craft when he had only seen wood before.\n\nEryn spent the hour before noon with the kind of attention that wrings sweat out of a person who is only standing still. The second bowl had begun to change. You could not watch it do it. You had to turn away and then check and then know it had moved and feel both relieved and angry, which is how a city grows and a woman makes a decision she knows will cost her. The black edge lifted up the thickness of a thumb and sank back as if reconsidering. A swipe of wind came from the center without bringing the smell of heat, and the grass along the rim leaned north as if being taught a lesson by a stern aunt. Santi placed a stick at the edge and marked it with his knife and when it moved, he marked again and sang a song under his breath to make the marks into a story and not a panic. Eryn crouched like a prayer and put her palm near, not on, and the air on her skin felt like metal might if metal were ashamed of itself for loving softness. She took a stone the size of an apricot, wrote her name on it with the ink Esteban had started making for the market, and put it in her pocket because sometimes the only way to be a seamstress in a life that keeps handing you knives is to plan to stitch something later with symbols foolish enough to believe in you.\n\nThe Dust Monks almost undid an afternoon just by being themselves. They held up their mirrors not toward the bowl but toward the faces staring at it, and people started seeing themselves and that is often a spark you cannot count on to behave. A child squealed because her hair stood on end without anyone\u2019s permission, and three boys laughed and then made their own hair stand as a way of courting the hum into thinking they were grown. Sister Vero found Tomas and told him in the tone of a woman confident you will hear her that their founder had said the day would come when the earth would ask us to speak quieter. Tomas pointed toward the soup kettles and told her the same thing in Fresno, and she lifted her mirrored bowl gently and went to sit by the rope and did not make ceremony of it. The hum in that hour ran along the edge of the cities people had within themselves, and a few of those edges softened and retained the softness and a few cut deeper to prove that steel was still a possibility here among goats and figs.\n\nThere were negotiations with God, because there always are. The cleric with the blue stole told his god who loves a horizon that he had found one in a bowl and he was trying to pretend that wasn\u2019t possible but his chest felt better when he leaned into the pretense. He offered the hum his mmhmm, which is a prayer you can take anywhere without breaking it, and it came back to him as a change in pitch that made him feel like a child hearing an adult sing badly and trying to match it. In the night he dreamed of water sitting in a stone cup without becoming less itself and woke to write that down shamefaced because it looked, in moonlight, like an attempt at a poem. He did not show it to Tomas. Tomas would have either praised it and ruined it or mocked it and made it better.\n\nUnder the north oak Sid and Dolores drafted, by lantern and biting flies, the Rope Oath in a copy that would be hung at the courthouse and in two copies that would be tucked inside cookie tins because Dolores trusted tins with the kind of loyalty she did not extend to stapled parchments. The oath said that you owed your city one hour of sitting still at a rope for every rumor you spread, and men laughed but they sat when asked because cords need weight to show they can hold. It said that soup could settle three disputes a day and no more, because soup runs out and so should argument, and for the overflow there were pebbles and a circle and a game taught by a fool who would let you cheat as long as you did it with style. It said the bowls would be considered graves when the women who kept graves said so, and until then they were considered markets where no one could sell anything but patience.\n\nEryn and Santi set their watch in thirds as if this were winter and the thing they were guarding against was hunger instead of curiosity. Around the second bowl they put little bells that Pina made from bottle necks and twine, low, at shin height, so that a man with intent would sing his malicious tidings before he got where he meant to go. In the dark a coyote sang that figure eight again, long ears weaving the air, and Pina said without irony that perhaps the coyotes were the form the hum would take when it decided to walk. Santi told her not to give the world ideas. Eryn slept four times for ten minutes and woke four times feeling guilty for the seconds she had abandoned the city. Guilt is a thread, and she rolled it around her wrist and made it into a bracelet rather than a noose because she had learned to dress herself on mornings she had not chosen.\n\nNear midnight the first bowl answered the second with a sound like a cart being pushed over worn wood and everyone who had ever pushed a cart that rattled in quite that way felt the insult and the compliment of recognition. The hum moved through the sleeping like a cat deciding which lap is best and some people dreamed of teeth and some dreamed of smooth edges and some did not dream at all because not dreaming is sometimes how a person keeps a day from taking all of them. Sid woke twice and did not go to the window, which made him feel like a man who had learned the smallest part of a thing he had promised to learn. He went instead to his table and his pencil broke and he laughed under his breath because Ajit had called it and because even if he had not he would have felt the world telling him, not everything needs a word tonight.\n\nAt dawn, when the sky wore a pale ridge of light that would turn to gold if you were lucky and to glare if you were not, Eryn stood with her hand on the gray mare\u2019s flank and her eyes on the black and she felt it decide something without telling her what that something was. The straight lifted again the width of a fingernail and set back down and when it did a breath came up that smelled like fennel that had been burned in a kitchen where someone had argued and then wept. She had planned three moves ahead of such a thing and none quite matched what she had been given, which is how you know you are alive and not a script. She whistled not the mare\u2019s call but a note she had made for emergencies and raised her hand not to shade her eyes but to hail a messenger only she could see. In the city a boy untied a ribbon from a post and began to run. Sid, who had been about to say his four sentences again at the courthouse because the second day is when men forget, put his hand on the words and held them still. He felt the pull that had nothing to do with lust and everything to do with obligation and desire having discovered they could share a chair for the space of an hour.\n\nThe day stretched itself thin and did not tear only because so many hands held it up. The law of soup did its secret arithmetic, subtracting two fights for every ladle. The rope held foolishness by the waist and made it laugh and sit down. The salt men learned, to their surprise, to look without planning where to put a foundation, and Lord Baeza wrote a second letter that used the word listen twice and his own men did not rib him for it because they, too, had felt the quiet without the sense of loss that came with quiet at sea. Tenorio taught Luz to hear the difference between a warning and a pronouncement and Luz went home and taught her mother and her mother taught the neighbor and soon there were twenty more ears in the city that were tools and not ornaments. Ajit promised a gate to a woman who had never been promised anything and then made it, and when it broke he fixed it without telling anyone and he felt afterward that he had done something both religious and rude.\n\nNear sunset, when men made themselves bigger with shadows, Gavino\u2019s watchers showed themselves at the second bowl in the least imaginative way. They found their harnesses snagged by Pina\u2019s bells and every step turned them into goats announced by tin. Eryn, who had perfected the art of making scorn into medicine, offered them bread and water and asked the name of their mothers and learned it and used it in a sentence in a tone you cannot buy and cannot fake. They untangled themselves from their humiliation and decided to wait until night to be foolish. Santi saw one look toward the black as if wishing to throw a crowbar at it and he walked into that look and stood there until the man\u2019s glance went dull. Three times a woman from Piedra came up the road to stare and cry and stare and not cry and Eryn stood beside her and looked with her and did not ask because asking is sometimes just laziness dressed as care.\n\nIn the yard under the fig-painted crenels, Sid sat with his people and ate soup and bread and listened to men tell each other what they had almost done and how they had saved themselves from it. He told Tomas to claim a corner of the courthouse for a guild of hands that kept people from setting fire to their own hair, and Tomas said he would hang a bell and if you rang it he would give you thread and a song, and if you rang it twice he would make you sit until your fury remembered it once had been love. Dolores washed her chalk-stained fingers and said quietly that they would need more tins for their laws because paper didn\u2019t hold under the weight of days like this. Rosales came by with the knife\u2019s twin and told Sid her grandmother had been humming all afternoon and when Sid said he knew, she meant the old woman had been alive in her, and he smiled because he had not known but now he did and that is a kind of miracle you can claim without owing anyone coins.\n\nHe went to sleep with the hum under him like a river were the bed it had always claimed to be and he let the desire to go north and stand beside the woman who had made a rule of staying where he could not see her be what it was. He did not tell himself stories meant to make his wanting noble. He put the want on the sill where the moon could see it and judge him and he lay down without reaching for it and that felt like using the better tool in a box he finally admitted he owned. Eryn, under oaks, threaded a bit of string through the hole in a button because her hands needed to practice what they insisted they were meant for, and she made a small ragged bracelet and tied it around Santi\u2019s wrist like a joke and not, and he accepted it with the gravest face to save them both from embarrassment. The hum rose once more like a thing learning to speak polite and swallowed its own name, and for a moment, in two places that had never been the same place and never would be, a king and a thief kept their mouths and their wonder both, and that was the only right way to end a day like this before beginning the next.Chapter Nine\n\nThey learned the sound of a morning that arrived already carrying something. Fresno\u2019s sun climbed up with a stiffness it had not confessed to in years, and the sky was the pale of a healed bruise. Sid stood under the fig-painted crenels with the woven hat tugged low and the taste of old copper in his mouth as if he had bit a coin in his sleep. He said the four sentences because discipline is the only muscled prayer he believed in, and the market heard them without surprise and with relief. People do not mind being reminded of the same small kindnesses if the day ahead threatens large unkindnesses. Dolores sent the bell boy with the tin and sent two girls with chalk and sent a man with a voice that reached four streets to sit by Tomas and learn to speak at a volume that took the place of shouting. Sid watched the faces lift and lower and settle around his words and he thought bitterly and fondly of soup. He thought if he ever managed another decade in this city he would have to build a statue to a pot.\n\nBy the second hour the north wind did a new thing; it arrived and then stopped and then remembered itself and came again without malice. Tenorio turned toward the hills and cupped his good ear as if catching the day like a fly. \u201cIt\u2019s rolling like a barrel you shouldn\u2019t have let your cousin seal,\u201d he said, and the sheep men laughed without threat because that was exactly the feeling and because metaphors could be tools when the right calluses wielded them. Ajit had been counting while other men listened. He had his chalk on the cobbles and his gate schedules in his head and the taste of grit at the back of his throat where paper turns to reluctance. \u201cIt will take the pressure at Walnut Skew and at La Palma both,\u201d he told no one and Dolores at once. \u201cIf the hum runs under at the same rate as the flow, we can teach the gates to breathe, and if it doesn\u2019t, we can teach men how not to panic while they pretend they did.\u201d\n\nDolores sent a boy for Rosales and sent a woman to bring Ajit the flat bread he forgot and sent a note to the women who kept the graves written in the polite hand she used for saints. She knew the city as a box of moving pieces that would disobey if you bullied and would work miracles if you asked with the tone their grandmothers used on them when they were eight. She drafted, in between three orders and two jokes, the beginnings of an ordinance she told no one she was writing: the Breath Law, which would tell men that some days were for opening without fear and some days were for shutting without bravado, and which would be useless until someone made a ritual of it.\n\nAt the second bowl a man made of excuses and cheap metal arrived with dawn still arguing in his hair. Gavino brought two pigs in a cart with slats and the sort of ropes that fray their own ends in impatience. He had three men and the certainty that doing the wrong thing quickly would count as faith if you held your chin high. Pina\u2019s little bells told on them three steps before they showed their faces and Santi had his hand on the cart before any boast found breath. Eryn took her scarf off her head for the first time that day so the wind could see that she had come bare and not to threaten, and she smiled a smile that men have left rooms to avoid and then stayed awake thinking about. \u201cYou lower anything into this,\u201d she told Gavino, \u201cand it will not be pigs that come back out changed. It will be your name. It will be the way your mother is greeted at the well.\u201d\n\nGavino looked at Santi because men like him always look to find the crack in another man\u2019s patience. Santi\u2019s face said it had outlived winter, a fever, the kind of hunger that makes a man want to lie to himself, and a woman he had loved for a long time dying anyway. It said today was not the day a boy with too much jewelry made it worse. \u201cHear our bells,\u201d Santi said, and his voice was so even it might have been a level held against a wall. \u201cWe will untie them for you and let you go back down the road with your pigs alive if you leave before the wind changes. If you push, we will push. We are past the hour where I will be made ashamed of the care I take for things I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nPina flipped her knife end over end and caught it by the safe part and then showed Gavino the thing she had made from bottle necks and twine. \u201cMine rings louder than your name,\u201d she said, and there was no pride in it because it wasn\u2019t pride, it was fact. The pigs snorted because pigs have the good sense to be afraid of bowls that hum. Gavino held his jaw where the rings bit and let his pride do the arithmetic. Eryn waited him out because patience had won her more arguments than knives ever had, and when he snarled something about coming back and making parish business of this, she did not look at the men he would rouse. She looked at the women who would be made to sweep after him. She said quietly, \u201cYou bring a priest with a bowl and we will let him sit and mmhmm, and if he blesses your rope I will cut it and feed it to your pig and call it a consecration.\u201d He left because there is a kind of dignity in retreat when done before witnesses and because Santi did not take his hand off the cart.\n\nAt the first bowl they discovered that law was better obeyed when it was sung. Tomas took Dolores\u2019s slate and wrote the rope oath as if it were verse and then made the three old men sing it without harmony and without shame. Men laughed and then found themselves mouthing it, and when a stranger came with a hand reaching past Bee\u2019s knots, three people in three different languages said the same sentence with the same ends and the man\u2019s hand learned shyness. Sister Vero folded her mirror up in a square of cloth and sat without proselytizing because the hum that morning made its own sermon and she was tired of competing with elements. She said two lines of her founder\u2019s saying and then substituted a third she invented that moment: that the holiness we fear might be nothing but attention.\n\nLord Baeza\u2019s men arrived near the hour that made flies bold. They did not carry a bell tower; they brought coils of rope that had the good smell of tar and winter hands. They brought two men whose ears sat on their heads like tools rather than ornament, and when Tenorio looked at them he did the old man\u2019s version of nodding approval\u2014he spat with precision and did not smile. The two stone-listeners sat with Luz and her drumskin and treated the child as an apprentice rather than an audience, which made half the men nearby take them seriously. Baeza himself had learned to stand back from the rope without looking forced, and when a saltman new to inlanders stepped too close, Baeza caught his shoulder and squeezed in a manner that carried a map of limits. \u201cWe\u2019re guests,\u201d he said, and he did not like the words but he practiced them.\n\nAjit made the gates breathe. It was not as pretty as priests would have wanted. He ran, which is undignified in a man over forty who has carried chains with his teeth. He shouted when shouting would save a minute. He handed a boy his shirt to carry because it would slow him and he did not like the feeling of skin announcing itself but you do what you have to do when the river makes new ribs. He took Walnut Skew\u2019s chain with his three fingers and the rope of his forearm and the anger he had at iron that thought itself superior, and he timed the drop to the hum. It felt wrong and then it felt right and then it felt like nothing and then he realized his teeth had stopped hurting. He sent a runner to La Palma with a sequence written as if it were a poem a drunk could keep in his mouth and told him to recite it at every culvert. He did not know whether he was worshiping, but it had the same posture.\n\nThe women who kept the graves came in their working dresses and the shoes they were not afraid to get wet. They stood at the rope and said nothing for a long while and then asked for a bench because sisters do not stand when they can sit and still be more imposing than any man in armor. Dolores fetched a bench and then another and then a third and she did not gossip near them. They argued in the dignity of low voices about what a grave was and whether a place where no one had been laid down yet could be one. At last the eldest, whose hair had been white since a morning forty years ago and who had a habit of mispronouncing the names of men who lied to her, tapped the rope as if asking permission to enter a thought. \u201cWe will not call this a grave,\u201d she said, and two other women nodded because she had not got ahead of herself. \u201cWe will call it a mourning ring. People will bring what grief they cannot pour anywhere else and leave it here, and that will keep them from pouring it on their children. We will sit where the ring begins and we will sit where it ends and when it becomes a grave we will tell you and you will believe us.\u201d\n\nWhen the hum rose midday, the lattice returned in the dust and stayed a breath longer. Luz put her fingertips on her drum and hummed a note that matched and the grains arranged themselves into a different geometry, like ribs in a chest made of judgement. Tenorio\u2019s eyelids fluttered in that ridiculous way that makes you think of birds. \u201cIt\u2019s counting,\u201d he said, and it was not a useful sentence until he said, \u201cit counts to three and then insists on two and then rests, which means the next place will try to be new and then remember it has a twin and then we will have to hold our mouths and not say what comes after twin.\u201d\n\nBee, who had been told all morning to drink water and had obeyed because she remembered what it was to not have it to obey with, leaned over the drum and hummed a harmony. The grains shivered and made a pattern like a net laid wrong. Ajit held his schedule in his head and said, with the same voice he said gate, \u201cAt the third note we release at North Sluice for two minutes and catch at Dredge Street for seven. We will do this three times. We will pretend to be clever and later we will write down what we did and call it an instruction for men who don\u2019t like being told that bodies can be instruments.\u201d\n\nThey did it. The canal let out and took in in a way that made the water remember being a hand. The hum slid under the city and did not catch in places where it could have. A cup in a woman\u2019s house chimed against another and then stopped. A man who had tied a bucket to a rope asked his daughter to sing while he pulled and she did and the note made him cry, which embarrassed him and then did not. Sid watched Ajit\u2019s throat move with the work and thought that if he lived to be old he would train boys up to bring the man he loved more than he knew to water and give him easy days. He thought this in the middle of a crisis and that is how you know he was in it for the long shape, not the short noise.\n\nBy late afternoon, when the light tried to make men handsome and failed at all but a few, Sister Vero stood and asked in her mild assaulting way to speak. The rope had taught her gentleness without making her feel diminished and she found she liked that trick. She told the gathering that her founder had said the earth would speak when tired, yes, but also that the conversation most worth having would be the one you made in your mouth when you told yourself the story of what you were seeing. \u201cIf we say dragon and we mean fear,\u201d she said, \u201cwe will be given fear. If we say dragon and we mean wonder, we will be given wonder. If we say breath and mean law, we may be given enough time to make one.\u201d It was not eloquent. It was not even new. It made three men who were about to do a stupid thing sit on their hands and unlearn the urge for thirty breaths and that bought someone else time to build a fence of questions.\n\nOn the north road a cart came with parts of a bell tower wrapped in canvas because men never believe you when you tell them you do not need a bell. Lord Baeza intercepted them with the easy impatience of a captain who has brought his ship into a dock that pretends to be a wall. He told them there were bells enough in men\u2019s throats and that hanging a weight from a roof over a hole would make the hole a person and they were not electors of that person. The men argued and then were outnumbered and then decided to be merchants and sell the canvas as shade for the soup pot, which turned them from opposition into assets and Tomas congratulated them on their conversion. He set their pole aside and tied a string of bones to it and called it a shrine to patience and they threw him a curse and then a coin and then a grin.\n\nAt the second bowl the wind went east and brought the smell of something that had never been alive. Eryn had expected it and hated that about herself. The black straight piece lifted three fingernails thick and settled back with a grace that made all the hairs on her arm salutes of their own. Pina hissed the word that meant stop without making a sound and the boys in the scrub froze like deer who had learned to be predators for a moment. Santi marked another line in the dirt and head-counted without moving his chin because he took census seriously only when bodies were at stake. Eryn felt, in that instant, the peculiar sistole of a day that refuses to be linear. She wanted to be everywhere\u2014the first bowl to see if the lattice changed its mind, the second to see if the edge would confess, the lower farms to catch the man now pouring too much water, the fig orchard because it had been where she had made a mistake and mistakes call you like home. She stayed. She held her breath. She did not give the bowl any names in her head. The hum accepted the lack with gratitude the way a child accepts not being told their own story wrong.\n\nSid arranged what he could call a council only because people needed it called something. The women with the graves bench sat at his left and the salt men leaned on their elbows at his right and Tenorio had placed himself where he would be seen without being adored. Ajit, with a rag around his neck that had been dipped in river to stop him from boiling, stood behind Sid like a wall you only build in your first season as king and then never again because you learn to trust the building to be where you left it. They made the Breath Law into paper and then into the tin. Dolores enlisted the boy with calves like bent nails to carry the tin to the fig orchard where another could be placed by the plow throne so that the law would be in two places at once and therefore believed. Tomas ringed the tin with thread in a color he announced as unnameable and when someone said it was just green, he said that was the point, that names hide as often as they reveal.\n\nBy the third day\u2019s dusk, the city had grown quiet in a new way. It was not sulking. It was not waiting to explode. It was the quiet of a kitchen that has fed too many and then washed the last ladle. Bee had taught three boys how to tie the knot that turns a rope from a suggestion to a refusal, and she had taught a girl how to tell a man to sit without making him feel like a donkey and the girl had tried it on Tomas and Tomas had sat and it had been a good performance all around. Lord Baeza had sent his second letter and received, impossibly quick, an answer tied to a messenger\u2019s belt in seal skin that smelled like apologies. It said rope more than once. It said there would be money and there would not be priests unless the inland asked. It was a letter meant to be seen by a king and by a woman with chalk and by the market that liked to make a day into a story.\n\nThat was when the clean fire came down the ridge. It did not look like fire. It looked like a shimmer over dry grass. It made a coyote\u2019s outline into a lesson and then let the coyote yelp and run and leave behind a smell like burnt fennel and embarrassment. The wave carried no light of its own and it touched the rim of the first bowl and the rim hissed and then calmed, and every mouth in the yard made the little oh that people make in churches and bedrooms and over broken things. Tenorio held out his hand. His rings, which he wore not for decoration but because his fingers thought better when they remembered the weight of metal, sang in his bones. He swore once, honestly, and pulled them off and put them in Dolores\u2019s palm because women who keep books and soup can keep other valuables in a way men will not consider theft. \u201cNo metal at the rope,\u201d he said, and the sentence cut three foolishnesses in half where they stood.\n\nThe cleric put his whalebone ring in his pocket and glowed slightly from the relief of being told what to do that made immediate sense. Lord Baeza took the plates off his men with motions that suggested intimacy between commander and commanded and set them aside gently as if the straps were tendons and would remember cruelty. Ajit looked down at his chain and did not flinch at the way his missing fingers felt like doctrine. He said to the boys at the gates, \u201cLeather wraps today. You hold with cloth. Your mother\u2019s aprons will save you and you will return them washed.\u201d\n\nEryn saw the shimmer at the second bowl lift a grass\u2019s width of dust and settle and she taught her breath to obey manners. She sent Pico down with a knot to tell Sid what she could not dictate. She put her body between the black edge and the place where a boy would be stupid because she had been that boy at other times of her life and a body in the way always helps. Santi took his bracelet\u2014the ragged string Eryn had made there in the dark\u2014and tied it around the new stake he had set to mark the change so that anyone who did not think much of men would be told by thread what needed not doing. Pina snapped at Lark because he had reached for a rock with the old, terrible itch in his fingers, and he held his hand back and made a small noise because he had almost understood himself. They did not call it miracle and they did not call it curse. They called it noon-at-dusk and this is how language earns its bread.\n\nWhen night put its full weight on the ridge, Sid walked as far as he could before duty made a leash of his ankle and he stopped under a tree that had been there before he had words. The air was a kind of friend who had not seen him for three days and intended to remind him he was mortal. He thought, because he was trying to live, of ordinary things: of the sound the stoneware made when Dolores put it on the board a little too hard at the end of a day; of the way Ajit sighed when a gate obeyed; of the face Santi had made at soup as if he were trying to decide between gratitude and grief; of Bee tying a knot as if she could tie time; of Tenorio setting his rings aside with the face of a priest turning from the altar to the basin; of Lord Baeza eating bread and pretending to disapprove of it and then asking for another piece; of Sister Vero watching her mirror reflect nothing and deciding that was the point; of Eryn\u2019s hand on her own wrist holding her scarf on not as fashion but as restraint. He did not go to the window when he lay down. He put his hand out on the bed where something might lie and he did not lie to himself about who he wanted to be there or what that would cost.\n\nOn the fourth morning a deputation from the women of Lower Woodlake arrived with a question and an answer folded into it. They asked whether the mourning ring could also be a place to lay down promises and they answered themselves by laying down three: that no child of theirs would go to the rope without a mother\u2019s word; that no man would set a fire in anger inside the smell of soup; that when the bowls named themselves they would listen and say the names right even if those names were hard. Sid wrote them into the tin because some words need to rattle to feel real. Dolores wrote them onto a slate because slates do not get rebuked by rain. Tomas wrote them on a piece of ribbon and gave it to a boy and told him to tie it to anything that would not be improved by a knot, and the boy tied it to his own wrist and declared himself a draft horse and was not entirely wrong.\n\nThe third place announced itself before noon by not being a place. It was a line two fields long where the earth sighed and dropped the thickness of a man\u2019s hand, and the grass laid itself flat as if measuring fabric. Ajit felt it in the backs of his knees. Tenorio heard it in his good ear like someone dragging a chair on a floor in the next room, the old complaint of wood. The hum in the bowls did not rise to meet it; it let the line be. There was relief in that. There was also the knowledge that whatever was beneath them did not intend to be mapped on anyone\u2019s schedule but its own. Dolores sent two boys with chalk and told them to mark both ends and then sit on the chalk to make it a place, because place is a thing you decide as much as a thing that happens.\n\nEryn walked the new line and looked at the way the cracks refused to be dramatic. She had tended to love only the dramatic because it had been a way of insisting she was alive when the quiet tried to convince her otherwise. Now she made friends with modest rupture. She knelt and pressed her fingers to the least interesting seam and felt there the whisper a bow makes before a string is drawn. She wanted to shout. She wanted to sing. She did not do either because the Dust Monks had taught her something against her will and Bee\u2019s knots had taught her the same thing willingly. She stood and shaded her eyes and saw from the ridge the dust rise from the first bowl as if a man had thrown a blanket in anger and then shook it until he remembered blankets are for warmth. She thought, because she had not been gifted with patience the way some had been but had learned to steal it, that perhaps the bowls and the line wanted to be looms. She did not test the word aloud. She put it in her mouth like a seed.\n\nGavino came back at dusk with company who took up space by claiming not to. Eryn put her palms on her knees and asked them what their mothers would think if the last thing their sons did was argue with a woman about pigs on a day that had made patience an art. They bristled less at being made ridiculous than at being made ordinary. Tomas wandered up the path with a thread on his wrist and a bone in his pocket and told a long, wearying story about a man who lowered a pig into a well to see if it would come out clean and how the pig had fallen in love with the dark and refused to come back and how the man had been forced to climb down and live there and how the town had had to either bless the well or fill it and they had done neither because they\u2019d become the sort of people who could not make a choice. It was a pointless story that was either about them or not and that annoyed them enough that they left just to spite it. Santi squeezed Tomas on the back of the neck in thanks and Tomas shrugged like a man who knows exactly what he has done.\n\nNight broke open without theater. Under the fig-painted crenels, Sid read the day back to himself the way a man reads a recipe to see where he had lied. He and Dolores turned the tin in their hands and both thought of their mothers without saying the word, because tin remembers better than paper and both their mothers had been made to make do with it. He thought of the boy Pico asleep under a cart with one shoe half on, of Luz listening to flies decide where to land, of Lord Baeza dreaming of a wave with edges, of Sister Vero turning her mirror to face the wall, of Tenorio without his rings feeling and not liking his lightness, of Ajit with his rag around his neck snoring like a man who has earned every rasp. He thought of Eryn at the second bowl with the gray scarf tied not at her throat but round her arm and the mare\u2019s breath close by and the black edge within reach if she allowed it and the thread in her pocket with her name on the stone.\n\nHe slept and did not dream in a way that felt like trust rather than exhaustion. The bowls hummed and then did not. The line sighed again, and two raccoons paused at the edge of it, offended, and then found another path because animals are atheists and it serves them. In the morning, when the sky decided to be a mint version of blue, Fresno woke still being Fresno instead of something else, and that counted as a victory that could not be marked on any ledger. Sid went to the rope before he went to the courthouse because he had made a law and it would be good to obey it in a visible way. He put one hand on Bee\u2019s knot and one hand on the rope that Baeza\u2019s men had tarred and he put his mouth close to the air over the bowl and he did not speak into it. He let it be. The hum came as if pleased.\n\nHe turned and saw Eryn below at the bend in the lower road where hawkweed grows without permission. She did not come up. She did not lift a hand. The gray scarf was around her wrist and looked, for a moment, like a ribbon Bee might have tied as a joke on the world. He went down the path until the rope asked him with its rub to stop and he did. She stood inside the little gate Marta had made like a removed piece of fence and looked, not at him, but at the slope. \u201cI have a new word I am not ready to believe,\u201d she said without greeting, because there are days you can only save your life by being unromantic. \u201cI will say it when I can say it without thinking of men building churches out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will sit here,\u201d Sid said, and did, in dust that had learned to be domestic. \u201cI will tell no one your word. I will do the things I am good at doing that keep boys\u2019 hands from empty places. I will make soup laws and breath laws and rope oaths and I will write your not-word into the part of me that makes decisions and I will obey it without speaking it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo that,\u201d she said. \u201cDo your little magic and I will do mine. The world likes little magics better than big ones because little magics happen while the world is looking the other way.\u201d She almost smiled, and then the almost did the work of a whole smile simply because it had to. \u201cWhen you make a bed for men to go to when they would otherwise light a fire, make it far enough from the rope that the hum has to work to reach them. Give them something to do with their hands that is not their knives. Give them the bones of goats and string and tell them to make saints out of them. They\u2019ll laugh at you and then they\u2019ll start and then they\u2019ll keep going because they have found a thing that won\u2019t make their friends bleed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you come into the city,\u201d he asked, and it was a stupid question and it was the right one because he wanted to know if his city deserved her. He wanted to know if his people could sit at a table and not try to make her name theirs.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a boy from Piedra who thinks he can teach the hum his song. I need to sit with him and tell him he is right and then show him which part of right is safe. Also there is a man who will come with a cart and try to sell the black in the second bowl by the ounce as if it were medicine. I mean to remove his wheels. It will profit him to learn to carry what he sells.\u201d\n\nWhen he stood to go, because the rope was a beast and had pulled enough on both of them to make retreat the honorable act, he said the only one of his private sentences he would dare aloud. \u201cWhen the word comes,\u201d he told her, and his mouth made it gentle, \u201cI will say it wrong first. That is my habit. Correct me.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, and for a moment he saw her as a seamstress and not as a cutter of threads, as a woman who could stand at a loom and call men to bring her what they had and make from it a pattern no one had believed could be worn. Then she turned her face back to the slope and the hum, and he went up to the rope and down to the city and into the day that had already decided to be difficult without having the dignity of being dramatic.\n\nBy noon the city had learned three new ways to keep from breaking. Ajit hung buckets of water at corners that had never seen kindness and told whoever walked by that it was theirs. Sister Vero set her mirror where it would catch only the hands and not the bowl, and men came to see their hands and to discover that they did not mind them as much as they had the day before. Luz taught two women how to make the dust move on the drumskin and those women taught four and one of them named the pattern she made for a horse that had died and somehow the naming made the pattern less sad. Lord Baeza took his armor apart the rest of the way and sat in his shirt in the heat and let a child tie a ribbon around his wrist and did not remove it. Tenorio took his rings back when the shimmer failed to rise at the expected hour and put them on one by one like promises and sighed as if vows could be a relief.\n\nIn the evening the rope held a man in place who would have run to the bowl to shout a secret; he held him like a friend might hold a shirt. The man cried not because the rope denied him but because he realized he had not been listening for most of his life and that the feeling under his ribs was not one he could sell. He sat and Tomas sat with him and told him a story about a fish who had learned to climb and then had learned that the best thing about climbing was descending without shame. The story had no moral and therefore it could be kept.\n\nOn the fifth morning, which no one had pinned hopes on and therefore it permitted a little grace, the black edge in the second bowl lifted two fingers\u2019 thickness and held without thinking better of itself. Eryn did not say her word. Sid did not go north. Ajit taught a boy to pull a chain with the right muscle. Dolores tied a knot as if the past were a thing you could make a belt from that did not rub. Lord Baeza watched a man who had decided to be better without saying it and thought, privately, that the horizon might exist even inland. Tenorio put Luz\u2019s drumskin to his ear and hummed a note that made the dust lay in an old pattern he remembered from a quarry that had become a lake, and he cried because a man is allowed and then went on with his day. Sister Vero sat with her mirror in her lap and did not try to explain anyone to anyone.\n\nGavino did not come with his pigs. He sent a boy whose ear did not yet bleed. The boy left a note tied in bad twine to Marta\u2019s brush gate that said an apology without the word and carried in it the ignorance of how to begin. Marta tucked the note into the tin and told Dolores there were worse beginnings. Sid wrote on the slate the breath schedule for the day and Ajit wrote beneath it a rude aside that made two men grin and do the work and that saved three minutes and three minutes add up over a season. Bee tied a ribbon no one saw to a place where only a woman who had loved someone slippery would look, and later that afternoon Eryn found it and laughed out loud like a girl.\n\nWhen the sun laid down flat on the ridge and the bowls sang each to each in the shy talk of instruments who were just learning, the city hummed back. It was not a hymn. It was not a pledge. It was not even music as much as a refusal to be silent where silence would be taken as consent. The mourning ring received three promises and one regret. The rope held. The soup learned a new ratio of onion to salt. Men took off their rings before they got to the rope without being told. The tin held the paper through a brief wind that wanted to make men watch it rather than work and failed. And in the night, in the place where he had learned to put his want where the moon could judge it without shaming him, Sid slept with his hand open and Eryn slept with her hand in the dirt and the hum did not press harder than either could bear. It was not victory. It was what you need to keep going long enough to make victory a word you can say without the taste of blood.",

                              "content": "At the hour when the dust turns silver and the owls yawn, King Sid of Fresno walked the eastern parapet and stared at his city like a man who had inherited a stubborn animal. The roofs were low and sun-bleached. The river beyond was stitched with irrigation lines, little veins going every direction, carrying a kingdom\u2019s lifeblood to thirsty almonds, grapes, cotton, orchards that made a map of patience when seen from the old courthouse tower. Someone had painted royal blue along the crenels during his father\u2019s days, and now it peeled in the shape of islands and animals. He liked to name them quietly. That one a sea horse. That one a snake with two heads. He could name everything in sight, and it still felt unnamed.\n\nHe wore a crown of hammered copper set with amber, a compromise with the land; gold was for the coast, with its salt minds and pearl brides, and Fresno was copper, good metal, honest and warmed by hands. The crown sat a little crooked on him, no matter how often Dolores the steward nudged it. He pretended not to notice. The wind brought him the scent of wet silt mixed with dry straw and diesel ghosts. The canal gates were opening, the ditchriders whistled, and the city shook itself awake.\n\n\u201cMajesty?\u201d Dolores had a habit of arriving like a second thought and becoming impossible to ignore. She was narrow and solemn, all knuckle and ledger and an eye that saw through excuses like sun through thin cloth. \u201cThe Mendota siphon burned again last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain.\u201d Sid rested his hands on the parapet so he could feel the cool stone. \u201cAnyone hurt?\u201d\n\n\u201cA rider named Rafael. He breathed too much smoke. He\u2019ll live if his wife can keep him from talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the water?\u201d\n\n\u201cRunning, but crooked. We had to let three hours go to save the eastern fields. The figs will complain.\u201d She glanced down into his city, where the market was unrolling like a rug and the butchers\u2019 shade tents popped open in the pale light. \u201cWe found her mark.\u201d\n\nSid didn\u2019t ask whose. The city had learned not to say her name loudly; it made the children stare toward the river with too much story in their eyes. He nodded. \u201cShow me.\u201d\n\nDolores held up a cloth packet. Inside, a bone token, smooth with handling, etched with a lattice of fine cuts that made it glitter when the light caught it just so. A thread cut many times. People had started to call her Threadcutter. It sounded like something from old folktales you told in the heat, to make the skin go cool with dread.\n\n\u201cWord is,\u201d Dolores said, \u201cshe wants a parley.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou believe word?\u201d He turned the token over and over. There was a nicked corner, a little dent. He wanted to imagine her teeth there. He told himself not to.\n\n\u201cWord came with a man whose ear has her scar. And he came through the old fig orchard without anyone catching him. Either we are bats in daylight or we were meant not to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cMeant not to see,\u201d Sid said. The token slid lightly across his palm, alive. \u201cWe see what she wants.\u201d\n\nDolores\u2019s mouth became a string pulled tight. \u201cYou could deny her. Make a thing of it. No parley with thieves. We are a kingdom. This is not some play.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is exactly some play,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd everyone knows it. And the ones who pretend not to are the worst at watching their bags.\u201d He turned his face back to the horizon. The low ridge beyond the fields was blue in the morning, and further than that the Sierras pretended to be clouds. Once, as a boy, he had thought the mountains were people sleeping. People who could wake. \u201cI\u2019ll meet her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith how many?\u201d Dolores\u2019s pencil hovered over the air, hungry for numbers.\n\n\u201cWith whoever thinks I can survive on my wit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a small mess of somebodies, Majesty.\u201d\n\nHe grinned. He didn\u2019t do it often in council, but up here the air was unjudging. \u201cThen I will owe you a new mess.\u201d\n\nDolores bowed just enough to appease the notion of respect and left with the token caught again in her careful hands. Sid watched her go, then braced himself for the descent. The tower had steps like bad decisions, steep and spalling. He took them anyway.\n\nThe hall at the old courthouse had been cleared of its long benches decades ago to make space for maps and fishers\u2019 nets, banners stolen from places that were not kingdoms anymore, and the throne his father had made from cherrywood and a plow blade. His father had been a man who believed you could make anything into something else if you hammered long enough. Sid had the same gift, people said, except still gentler hands. He sat, and when the guards and riders and canal men had taken their places\u2014anywhere, there was no court ceremony for this\u2014he lifted an arm like a man quieting a rowdy table.\n\n\u201cSpeak,\u201d he told Ajit, master of canals, a cheerful fellow who had a laugh like ditchwater and who smelled perpetually of minerals. Ajit was missing two fingers. He had lost them to a gate chain; he wore the loss like a medal.\n\n\u201cSpeak? I been speaking all morning,\u201d Ajit said. \u201cRosales is down there at the siphon crying like a goat and I told her I\u2019ll give her all the rags she wants but crying won\u2019t unburn cypress. Someone set a clean fire, majesty. And you can\u2019t set a clean fire in damp wood unless you know the wood. She knows it. I\u2019m telling you.\u201d He looked around, dared a contradiction. No one offered one. \u201cShe knows our lines. She knows our nights. I ain\u2019t saying we got a leak, but, you know\u2014\u201d he spread his hands the way men did when they meant everything and didn\u2019t want to say it outright.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s on night watch at Mendota?\u201d Sid asked.\n\nLearning that there had been a poker game somewhere there was meant to be a man on a horse with a lamp filled the hall with a windless sort of guilt. Sid heard it hiss across teeth and thought of all the small things that made a leak a flood. \u201cTell Rosales to keep her rags,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd send me a few good riders who can keep quiet and ask questions looking friendly. Not noble. Friendly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ain\u2019t noble,\u201d Tomas\u2014the jester, although no one in Fresno had a taste for jester hats and cornets\u2014said from where he was sprawled on a spool of blue rope. Tomas had a way of speaking from the angle of things, like light that came in through a crack you forgot existed. \u201cWe\u2019re parched and mean and God-chosen.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod is tired of being chosen,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cHe keeps asking for receipts.\u201d\n\nLaughter. It loosened the air. Sid savored it. He had grown up among a people who could make jokes standing in line for water, because you had to laugh or you\u2019d start hating the person in front of you simply because they were thirsty, too. \u201cAnd the parley,\u201d he said when the amusement had thinned to a manageable hum. \u201cWe\u2019ll meet at the old fig orchard. I\u2019ll take four.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour?\u201d Ajit straightened. \u201cThere\u2019s bandit stories ripe like grapes about that orchard. They say your voice comes back to you there and tells you all the things you said wrong. It\u2019d take twenty, to drown it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m counting on listening,\u201d Sid said. \u201cPick the four.\u201d\n\nThey chose them as quietly as you choose people to carry a stretcher: Vera with the lazy eye and the bad temper, a rider named Santi who had survived three winters in the foothills alone after his wife died, a young woman called Bee for the pattern of freckles on her face, and Dolores herself, because it was unthinkable for the steward to let her king go into the orchard to be unaccounted for. Ajit tried to come. Sid shook his head. \u201cYou send late water to the figs. Not too much. Enough to make them sweet, not enough to make them swell and split, so they wonder at their fortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s witchcraft,\u201d Ajit said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s farming,\u201d Sid said. \u201cSame difference.\u201d\n\nHe took off his copper crown, set it upon the plow throne, and put on a woven hat with a brim wide enough to shade a horse. In the mirror shards set into the pillar near the throne he saw a face he liked less and less each year: lines forming at the corners of a mouth that always tried to be kind and sometimes had to be something else, a scar on his left cheek\u2014not a noble one; he had cut himself on a rain gate in his first summer as king. His eyes were his mother\u2019s. Everyone told him. They told him so often he stopped knowing what his own eyes looked like to himself and only knew the story. That afternoon, he had dreamed of her hand on his crown, firm and quick, giving no time for refusal. It had happened. He had not dreamt it. He touched his temple.\n\nThey rode out in a heat that did not yet mean it but had rehearsed the lines for months. The old fig orchard crouched east of the city in a fold of land that caught fog in winter and secrets at all seasons. Half the trees were wild and half pruned, and the ones on the edges were in constant debate about which to choose. The ground was soft with dropped fruit, sour and sweet, a bargain with bees. Sid tasted one, its skin a little like paper, the inside honey-plush. He remembered a boy with his hands aluminized by moonlight, filling a bucket in the orchard and eating two figs for every one he saved. The trees had a way of leaning in to listen.\n\n\u201cI hear nothing yet,\u201d Tomas murmured. He had come anyway, because he oft came and no one could recount why until he said something and then you were grateful. He wasn\u2019t one of the four. He was the fifth that followed five steps behind and became the story people told later.\n\nIt had been agreed with whispers that there would be no archers in the trees and no horses brought into the grove. So there were archers, hidden badly enough that Sid could find them, and one horse that belonged to someone who didn\u2019t much like rules. He saw the horse first. A pale gray mare with a black mane like spilled ink, who tossed her head in the shade, a queen tired of her crown. The man holding her rein was small and unfrightening, so he was a message. The messages mattered more than the words sometimes. Sid dismounted.\n\nA woman stood near the largest tree. She had the casual stance of someone whose knife obeyed, and a dress that had once been a soldier\u2019s coat cut to fit the body she had made without anyone else\u2019s permission. In the shade her hair turned blue-black. She had wrapped a red scarf around her throat in a way that dared you to grab it and also promised to garrote you with it if you tried. He had never seen her face before. He had seen drawings of it that made legends out of cheekbones. He wished he were a poor man anywhere else.\n\nShe did not curtsy. He did not expect it. She stepped forward and offered him a fig. \u201cWe\u2019re obliged, King,\u201d she said. \u201cA parley, is it? That\u2019s the right word. We both have songs we want to sing and don\u2019t have the right throat for.\u201d\n\nSid took the fig. \u201cIf I had the right throat I could sing my song from the roof and you\u2019d hear it in your sleep with no efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy sleep is unruly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gets up and walks around. I tell it to settle down, be good, but it keeps meeting the wrong people.\u201d\n\nDolores cleared her throat, which was the opposite of a song. \u201cBe plain,\u201d she said. \u201cPlain saves lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlain is ugly,\u201d the woman said. \u201cPlain won\u2019t look you in the eye afterwards but does not lie about it. You want plain? I\u2019ll give you the plain: stop locking the river like it\u2019s a woman you stole.\u201d\n\nVera murmured an apology to someone for her breath and shifted her weight. Bee sucked a seed out of her teeth and looked down. The woman in the red scarf stared only at Sid. \u201cIt is not yours,\u201d she said, and her voice softened, so that the figs and the bees leaned in. \u201cIt isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s. You have built clever gates. You\u2019re good. The men who work them are tired and proud. They deserve to be safe. But the river isn\u2019t yours. It\u2019s a line drawn by someone\u2019s finger once. And the finger moved over faces that were not yet born.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wear a soldier\u2019s coat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt belonged to someone who pointed. What\u2019s the difference between pointing at water and pointing at a man? Both go where you want as long as you\u2019re strong enough to make them sorry not to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d she said, and smiled, and the day did a strange thing, it stepped back to make room for the smile. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing about sorry. It curdles. It grows teeth. Down river, the earth remembers the sound too easily. The old ones say there was a time before the Breakage when men argued in rooms and signed papers and the water still went where it wanted because it had all the time in the world. We don\u2019t have that time now. We have this season and the next, and the next might be ash.\u201d\n\nSid watched the way her hands moved in the air, making and unmaking. He watched the archers who didn\u2019t exist in the trees shift their feet. He heard his own voice the way you hear a horse\u2019s hooves on dry clay: warning and relief. \u201cWe can talk about gates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can talk about schedules. We can talk about extra water for the lowest fields when the figs need it most. We cannot talk about the river being no one\u2019s. Because if it is no one\u2019s it becomes the strongest one\u2019s. You know it. I know it. It\u2019s just whether the strongest is an office with ledgers and a lock, or a man with a scarf who will leave in the night after taking everything that shines.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think I take the shiny things.\u201d The red scarf brushed her knuckles when she turned her head. \u201cThere are shinier things than copper and sugar. If I wanted all the shiny I would be in your hall counting tiles. I want a thing that can\u2019t be counted. That\u2019s troublesome, I know.\u201d Her eyes flicked to the crown he was not wearing. \u201cDo you think I like this?\u201d She tugged the coat. \u201cIt itches. The person it fit is dead. Men died to make me a stranger to myself and now there is no road that moves in a straight line.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did he die?\u201d The question surprised him. He wanted to call it strategy and felt in his ribs that it wasn\u2019t.\n\nShe was silent so long a fig fell and split and the scent of sugar rose like an oath. \u201cHe drowned,\u201d she said. \u201cNear Firebaugh. He was pulled under by a snag of manzanita that everyone ignored because we all thought we knew the river better than we did. He went down believing in his own lungs. He came up too slow to do anything but show me his eyes. If I cut a thread now and then, know that he went down with all the threads in his hands, and I still am not sure if he meant to give them away or keep them.\u201d\n\nSid held the fig she had handed him and did not eat it. Flies touched the bruises on its skin. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, and did not try to make it a king\u2019s sorry that could right the world with a decree. \u201cWe can walk out there and cut the manzanita together.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour gates,\u201d she said, and her tone became a thing made of rocks. \u201cThey are manzanita.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnough.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me your name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know mine in a hundred stories. Let me have one word to say that means you and not the idea of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I give you my name,\u201d she said softly, \u201cyou\u2019ll keep it in your pocket and take it out when you\u2019re alone and hold it and it will grow warm and heavy and you\u2019ll know all its edges, and then when you\u2019re too far from me and you want to be close, you\u2019ll say it to yourself and that will be a kind of theft.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll find that edge no matter what you say,\u201d he said, and realized he had moved a little closer, and that everyone in both parties had noticed and not decided yet if it was dangerous.\n\n\u201cEryn,\u201d she said finally. \u201cMy name is Eryn Vale. And I would rather be a seamstress than a cutter of threads but you cannot stitch with gates.\u201d\n\n\u201cEryn,\u201d he said, and he did feel it, the weight. He felt the way the syllables sat on the tongue like a fruit pit, something that might grow if planted and might just choke you if you mis-swam. \u201cI\u2019m Sid.\u201d He almost said, I am Sid of Fresno, or King Sid, or any of the names that were less like him and more like duties. He didn\u2019t. \u201cCome walk,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one will shoot if you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t shoot. Ask anyone. I\u2019m famous for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re famous for,\u201d she said dryly. But she walked, and they walked under the low branches, where the sun made little coins of light on the old grass. The others trailed at a careful distance, their footfalls different languages.\n\n\u201cYour men set a clean fire,\u201d he said, while a fly made its mind up about his hat brim. It was too blunt a thing to say. He said it anyway. \u201cThat was careful. It was also cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the taste of careful,\u201d she said. \u201cCruel lives next door. You keep telling yourself you only visit. The first night you sleep on that couch because you\u2019re tired. The second because it\u2019s easier to not go home in the dark. People make a nest in your hair. They tell you you look like you belong. You forget the way the sheets smell in the place where you said you would always lay your head.\u201d Her hand brushed his sleeve. He told himself she had done it to keep moving.\n\n\u201cIs there a way we can make new maps?\u201d he asked. \u201cMaps where a little is given without being stolen?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a treaty,\u201d she said. \u201cOn paper. With your stamp. With a witness. With Tomas to make a joke at the end that people will call wisdom if they like you and bad manners if they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomas is not wise,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am exactly wise enough,\u201d Tomas called from a branch he should not have been able to climb as quietly as he had. \u201cWhich is less than a god and more than a guard, and in the middle of everything stupid.\u201d\n\nEryn looked up at him and laughed in a way that made Vera relax for the first time all morning. \u201cHello, fool,\u201d she said. \u201cDo you remember me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all remember the stories we tell ourselves to live,\u201d Tomas replied, and plucked a fig and missed his mouth and dropped it on his shoe. \u201cBut not the ones we tell ourselves to die.\u201d\n\nSid didn\u2019t know what to do with half the things Tomas said, not because he was a fool but because he was a mirror that refused to reflect anything but the person looking. \u201cIf you could make a treaty,\u201d Sid said, \u201cwhat would it ask for?\u201d\n\n\u201cDignity,\u201d she said with no flair at all. \u201cAnd a year. One year where you don\u2019t let a single acre rot because the wrong men were late. One year where no one\u2019s child walks seven miles for a bucket you\u2019ll sell back to them at a price you won\u2019t pay yourself. One year to see if I can stop cutting threads because there\u2019s nothing left to strangle anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can give you a year we both promise to be good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut being good is an agreement with a ghost. As soon as the water is low and the wind runs hard and the canals crack, men will feel old hunger. What then?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d she said, and leaned in as if she were telling him how to cheat at dice, \u201cyou remember that there was a year you did not.\u201d She tilted her head. \u201cDo you know how soft the river smells after the first rain? The dust lifts like a child to be held and then it falls down slow and you can taste a metal thing, and the worms come up, curious and brave, like men who have never had their hearts broken.\u201d\n\nHe saw it behind his eyes and, worse, in his chest. \u201cI know,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThen you know why I\u2019m in your orchard saying too much.\u201d She straightened as if shaking off a hand. \u201cI am making a mistake here. I should be making a point with my elbow and my men\u2019s sharpness. And yet.\u201d She shrugged. \u201cHere we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d he said, and he could feel the long afternoon ahead of him in which he would be unable to do any of the small useful things that kept the panic of being a king at bay. \u201cWe are. Will you eat with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn your hall? No,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone will know and everyone will stare. They will watch your mouth to see what you choose to taste.\u201d She glanced toward the city as if to prove she could see it even through the trees. \u201cYou can eat with me. Where I sleep is nobody\u2019s idea of safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do you sleep?\u201d He wanted to put himself in every place she said. He wanted to parcel himself into invisible pieces and hide them in the grasses and in the gorge and under the bark of the figs so he would always be with her and always know how to get back. The wanting made him ridiculous to himself. He forgave himself for it and it did not go away.\n\n\u201cIn a circle of ruin downriver,\u201d she said. \u201cAt night the old concrete walls sweat and the coyotes laugh at nothing. I will not tell you which circle. Not yet, Sid. Do not pretend to be shocked by not yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not dare,\u201d he said. \u201cI have done not yet so often I thought it was a town I owned.\u201d\n\nHe did not kiss her. It was barely possible, for a heartbeat, if the bees had all decided to go quiet at once and the archers had all sneezed from fig dust and the wind had stopped to tell them, the two of them just under the branch that held Tomas up like a bad idea in a good place. He did not. He thinks he didn\u2019t. Memory is a wayward dog.\n\nThey brought no treaty home, and if anyone had asked Sid what he had brought instead he would have held his hands apart and said the weight between them was not air and not good sense and not a lie. He ate fig jam on stale bread in the late afternoon with Ajit and listened to the man talk about gates like lovers. He half-slept in his chair and saw a river that had a mouth and spoke. He saw his father up to his knees in water cursing the things he loved for not being easier.\n\nThat night, under an angry moon that had somewhere else to be, a boy named Diego ran the south road with a story. He ran as fast as a story deserves. The guards at the tower took him in with a cup of something too weak to call coffee and stood him in front of the king who had put his crown on again because people were watching and watched him because he looked like a boy who might be the first page of a bad chapter.\n\n\u201cMajesty,\u201d the boy said, and then remembered to bow, and did so while still talking. \u201cThere\u2019s a shepherd in the foothills who saw fire walking like an animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople get drunk,\u201d Ajit said mildly from somewhere. \u201cAnd the imagination is a\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. He was not drunk. We have no liquor left. His dog is burnt. He brought the paw. He wouldn\u2019t come in the city because he says he doesn\u2019t be in rooms, but he gave me the paw. He said tell the king the mountain has a tooth. He said words I didn\u2019t understand about rattling stone. He knows rocks, he\u2019s a man who knows rocks in his hands, and he said they were humming like someone breathing bad.\u201d\n\nTomas sat up straighter as if the floor had nudged him. \u201cHumming,\u201d he said, and the word fell into the open place that had just formed in the hall. \u201cIs that the word he used? He\u2019s a shepherd. Did he say humming. Or did he say singing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumming,\u201d Diego said. \u201cBut it got in his bones, he said, and then went away and took his breath. He wants his dog to be seen by a priest so whoever did this knows God saw it too. Please don\u2019t make me say it again. I ran.\"\n\nDolores took the paw with both hands like a sacrament and did not flinch. The pad was black and bubbled. Sid closed his eyes and saw flame organized into a body. He opened them and saw his people organized into hope. \u201cFind the shepherd,\u201d he said. \u201cBring him a woman who knows herbs and a man who knows rocks and someone who knows how to listen to men who have lived too long with sheep.\u201d He could feel around his words something too old for his throat. \u201cAnd send word up the old road. Ask it everything it knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cMajesty,\u201d Dolores said later, when the hall had emptied down to the skins of its conversations and only the work of tomorrow remained. \u201cIf there is fire walking\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cNot yet. There is someone who saw too much of a thing he cannot name, and we will name it for him and then it will sit down. It will become a story with a beginning, and then it will be manageable.\u201d\n\n\u201cStories have middles.\u201d She rubbed her forehead with two dirty fingers. \u201cWe forget that. We always forget the middle is swamp.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to tell her Eryn\u2019s name and didn\u2019t. It sat whole in his mouth and made everything else taste like it. He went to his room and took off his crown and placed it on the window where the moon could see it and judge him. Down in the yard someone sang a song about men who choose the wrong women and then forgive them, which is to say, men who choose. The city\u2019s heat moved around him like a creature who did not mean to love him and did anyway, clumsily.\n\nIn the morning he went out with no guards and no crown. He went to the canal where the siphon had burned clean. He wanted to see the way the ash had organized itself when it fell. He wanted black on his hands as if touching what hurt in person made it less likely to happen again somewhere he could not reach. Rosales found him there. She was a short woman with shoulders like a yoke and a voice like a whistle. She called him King and then told him a story about her grandmother that had nothing to do with anything. He realized after that it had everything to do with everything. People loved by telling you what they could not hold anymore, because it spilled.\n\n\u201cShe left me her knife,\u201d Rosales said at the end, and showed him. The blade was old and new. Someone had ground it on new stone. It had a little nick.\n\nHe took it and it fit his hand as if he had held it before. \u201cDo you want it back?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIf you keep it,\u201d she said, \u201cyou keep her. And then she\u2019ll get you killed, and I will have to mourn twice. Give it to someone else who needs to pretend the past\u2019t steel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that me?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt might be. My grandmother would spit and say it\u2019s everyone.\u201d Rosales took off her hat and wiped her hair back. \u201cYou got a look, King. Like you saw a puddle that has sky in it and you jumped. Be careful, yes? That sky will drown you as quick as water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll practice holding my breath,\u201d he said, and then, because it was a morning for not yet, he closed his eyes and pictured Eryn catching a fig in one hand, her head thrown back when Tomas had said something only half was joke. He saw the red scarf like a wound and like a warning and like something you tied around a gift so that even if you were all elbows and wrong words the recipient would know you had tried to be splendid.\n\nHe returned to the hall. Papers waited with the patience of things that could outlive kings. He signed his name on water schedules and confirmed a levy on pistachios and allowed the songs of three old men who claimed to be the same man to be sung at market on Wednesdays. He corrected a scribe\u2019s spelling. He forgot what the old spelling had been. Night came and he did not ask Dolores to read back to him the day\u2019s mercies and crimes because he didn\u2019t think he could give each of them the same mouth.\n\nIn the solitude between lamps, someone came to his window. For a breath he thought the river had stood up and learned to climb. He reached for Rosales\u2019s knife and felt it in his hand like an answer to a question he was not done asking. A shadow detached itself from the shadow and sat on his sill as if it had every right and no shoes. Eryn. She had a way of changing the size of the room.\n\n\u201cThis is idiotic,\u201d she said without greeting. \u201cI could be anyone. You could have shot me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t shoot,\u201d he said. He stood and he was not surprised at all at how necessary it felt to be standing while she sat. \u201cHow. Why.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I realized after I left,\u201d she said, looking at his crown on the sill as if it were a small animal she might feed or not, who could say, \u201cthat if I let your people tell you about the thing up in the foothills they\u2019d clean it up so you would be able to sleep. And I wanted to see your face when you didn\u2019t. You make a particular face when you have one ache too many. It is not a king\u2019s face. It is a person\u2019s. You should be careful. It\u2019ll get you loved in the wrong ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dragon,\u201d he said.\n\nHer eyes, which had seemed to him like a lake at dusk, widened and lost everything but the reflection of his mouth. \u201cYou say it like it exists.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou came here to say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came here to not say it.\u201d She leaned back against the frame. Her scarf had no red tonight. It was gray as the mare she had brought to the orchard, and that felt like a kind of sacrament, too. \u201cThere\u2019s a pit up there. Or a bowl. Or a wound. And at the bottom of it something breathed and the rocks hummed, and a shepherd\u2019s dog got burned not by flame but by a sound. That\u2019s what the man said. He said his dog lay down because it thought it was night and the night made his hair go away. I saw the circle from far. I saw birds rise at wrong hours. I thought. Eryn, you need to be quiet. Your whole life you have been loud because that felt like the only way to exist. And now, hush, be small. But then I remembered you and how you said you know the smell of the earth when it lifts. And I did something stupid. I came.\u201d\n\nHe moved towards her because there was nothing else to do with his body. \u201cIf there is a dragon\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t educate it with your mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there is,\u201d he said anyway, \u201ceverything else we are arguing about is stubbornness at the wrong scale. We need to stop being clever with gates and be clever with worship.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not going to worship a thing that burns dogs with sound.\u201d She turned to the night where the city lay, pretending to be a map and failing at it, badly. \u201cWe are going to make sure we live to fight our small war another day.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre we fighting?\u201d he asked.\n\nShe looked at him then, and he saw that her face could become lovely with cruelty or with joy and he would be unable to tell which would break him more. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how to do anything else,\u201d she said, and reached for his crown and tipped it off the sill. He lunged, caught it. She laughed, because she had known he would and because it was very funny that a man who might have to become a myth had the hands of a ditchman. \u201cDon\u2019t start,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t make in your heart a room for me yet. I am full of splinters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have rooms full of splinters,\u201d he said, and it sounded ridiculous when he said it and truer than anything else he had said that week. He set the crown down on the floor, where it made a ring of copper moonlight. \u201cStay,\u201d he said. It was not wise. It wasn\u2019t even cunning. It was a request from a kind of animal older than kingdoms.\n\nShe stood up on the sill without taking his hand. \u201cI\u2019ve already stayed too long. You have someone named Dolores who did not scream from a fig tree but will scream soon. She will tell you there\u2019s a man in the yard with a burned paw and a song about stone, and you will look at me and you\u2019ll want to ask me what to do. Don\u2019t. Decide with your people. When you need a person who knows how to not die when rocks sing, send a ribbon down the old canal tied in a knot I recognize. Don\u2019t write. Paper is greedy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d he said, wanting to stop her without wanting to be a person who stopped things that moved fast. He didn\u2019t know what he intended to put after the words. He never did, and that was why he was always slightly behind everything he loved.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not your enemy in the way your men want,\u201d she said, and then was nothing but shadow again. \u201cI\u2019m worse,\u201d she said from down in the yard, and then there was only the night, which had, at last, settled down.\n\nDolores did scream. Not like a goat; like a woman whose ledgers had burst into flame. Sid went to the window for the second time that night and looked out over Fresno, his, and imagined the mountains as sleeping people and tried to imagine what face they would make if they woke and had no names left. He thought about his father\u2019s hands and his mother\u2019s eyes and Tomas in trees and Ajit loving his gates and Rosales\u2019s knife and Rosales\u2019s grandmother. He thought about Eryn\u2019s mouth shaping his name as if she were sewing with it.\n\nWhen the messenger ran through the gate and fell, Sid already had his boots on and his mouth set in the only line he knew for certain the city understood: we will go see. He went down, and out, and into his future like you go into a river you grew up beside: thinking you know it and knowing you might not, and going anyway, because you are from here. He was from Fresno. He was king. And he was a man who would, soon, learn the shape of dragons in his teeth and who else\u2019s name they could keep.",

                              "content": "Dolores\u2019s scream was not panic; it was a flare sent up so the necessary would gather. The yard below the window filled the way a cup fills when a heavy hand pours\u2014quickly and without apology. The boy who had run the story lay on his side, chest jumping like a fish netted and unsure of mercy. The shepherd stood apart from him, as men do who have spent too long with animals and wind. He held his hat in both hands as if he had come to a church he did not recognize but knew he should respect. Beside him, on a cloth that had held oranges once, lay the blackened paw. It was a thing that should not have been severed from anything, and yet it had been presented like a proof to a world that no longer believed without them.\n\n\u201cName,\u201d Dolores said, because names let you hold people steady.\n\n\u201cMateo,\u201d the shepherd answered, the lint at the edge of his cuffs smoked down to nothing. \u201cMateo of Dry Creek, the real Dry Creek, not that ditch you all call a creek to feel better. I kept my dog from whimpering for two hours and then he did not keep.\u201d He lifted his chin toward the foothills as if they were a person who had wronged him and did not yet know it. \u201cI have slept under oak that crackled with lightning and not broken. This is not that. The stones are behaving badly. It is a thing no one taught them and yet they learned. It went in my teeth. The old ones say the bones sing when the end comes. I am not old and I am telling you my bones sang.\u201d\n\nAjit came up behind Sid and stood a respectful half foot back the way men do when they want to catch a king if he falls but not crowd him into proving he won\u2019t. \u201cHumming in stone is not a ditchman\u2019s language,\u201d he murmured, more to the air than anyone. \u201cIt is a quarryword. We could ask old Tenorio. He listens to rocks like they whisper gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will ask everyone,\u201d Sid said. He stepped down into the yard, felt the looseness of sand under his boots, the easy bite of grit. He knelt by the cloth with the black paw and said a word he had never liked saying out loud because it was too simple to fit the sort of grief that came with it. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\nMateo stared at him as if he were a trespasser he might forgive on principle but not in practice. \u201cSorry is cloth you hold to a wound so your hand has something to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop the blood. Your men think the mountain is a drunk husband who will sleep it off. I am telling you it has a tooth and it is waking teeth first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go,\u201d Sid said, and before Dolores could remind him which signatures would be late, which men would take advantage, which gates would sit untended enough to tempt mischief, he raised his hands and shaped the morning as best he could. \u201cAjit stays and makes a map that counts men as well as gates. Send Rosales to the south siphon with two who can say no without shouting. Find Tenorio. Send word to the outposts that no one goes alone into circles or bowls or old quarries. Pair shepherds. Pair children. Pair anyone with feet. Dolores, count rope and lantern oil, and pull my riding coat that does not say King in every stitch. Bring the water skins that do not leak when a person wishes them to.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll water skins leak when you are tired,\u201d Dolores said, but she was already leafing through her mental ledgers and nodding to people who did not know that nod meant they were now part of the chapter they would retell to grandchildren. \u201cVera is with a toothache. We take Bee. We take Santi. We take Tomas whether we choose to or not. And we take Marta.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich Marta,\u201d Tomas asked from the edge of the ladder, where he had been listening with his head upside down as if the blood gathered there would make a better mind. \u201cBecause if you mean Marta of the yard, she is pregnant with a sadness and should not go near anything that hums. If you mean Marta of Piedra, she will spit and come and make the rocks behave by telling them her mother\u2019s stories until they feel foolish.\u201d\n\n\u201cPiedra,\u201d Dolores said, and Tomas saluted nothing in particular and veered off like a kite freed from a wise child\u2019s fingers.\n\nTenorio arrived as if summoned by consideration alone, an old man with calves like oaks and hands that had not known softness since his own mother\u2019s palm when he was a boy. He wore a string of tiny fossils around his neck the way priests wear bones. His hearing had gone in one ear and so he turned the good one toward Sid with a theatricality that made Bee hide a smile. \u201cThe earth makes music whether you listen or not,\u201d he announced without being asked anything. \u201cMostly it\u2019s a lullaby if you mind your feet. Sometimes it is a wedding song, you can tell because everything shakes in a way that makes people want to dance even if their knees were at war with them yesterday. You say it hummed.\u201d He looked down at the paw and made an old man\u2019s cross over his chest in a way that made Sid feel young and unwell. \u201cWe will hear if it wants us to.\u201d\n\nThey left the city by the east gate so that Fresno could watch them go and adjust its opinion of itself accordingly. People see kings leave and become either brave or foolish; Sid preferred brave and suspected most days that what he got was a braid of both. The road out was a two-lane memory where the asphalt sloughed like old skin, patched with gravel and volunteer grass that made the horses pay attention. The canals followed for a while like faithful dogs and then wandered off to flirt with fields, to promise and deliver and sometimes only promise. You could tell where the lines had been long before men put water in them by the way the land settled in upon itself, making gentler curves, a body remembering where it liked to be touched.\n\nThe foothills gathered long and blue-green, oak standing in their toadstool shade, granite showing itself in the honest way rock does when there is nothing left between it and sky. The heat had taken to itself a vocabulary\u2014cicada and dust and the kind of silence that isn\u2019t empty but is full of waiting. Santi rode as if the horse and his own bones were in a marriage that had shed its performative tenderness in favor of competence. Bee counted hawks and kept count out loud after the third because it was a comfort humans invented to keep from feeling as small as they were. Dolores balanced a ledger on her knee until the horse told her with a toss that she would regret it, and she put it away with a sigh that had arithmetic in it anyway.\n\n\u201cSay it again,\u201d Tenorio asked Mateo, who had come despite his eyes being hollowed by losing his dog. \u201cRattling stone. Humming. Breathing that had words in it or that was just air being unshy.\u201d\n\nMateo spat neatly in a way that managed not to offend anyone\u2019s gods. \u201cIt got into my hat. It made my belt hit my hip like a hammer. It made the sheep put their faces down and pretend they could go back into the earth like acorns. It was not wind. It was not the thing you feel when a truck goes by. It had direction. It came from a bowl and went in my teeth and then it left and all the birds were confused about the hour and sang the wrong songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cWrong songs,\u201d Tomas said. He was on foot, because he liked to feel the pattern of the world with his ankles, as if his body could read the same text the land had always been writing. \u201cFools know wrong songs. They are like a joke that doesn\u2019t want to be funny and still is, because the person telling it is trying so hard not to think about their mother.\u201d\n\nSanti flicked a look at him that might have become a grin if the day were softer. \u201cDo you plan to make sense today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI plan to provide commentary,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cSense is a trick gods used to sell men fear.\u201d\n\nThey left behind the last almond rows where white shells had made a brief spring snow and turned into a kind of country that liked to pretend it was untouchable and then turned its ankle on a gopher hole. The oaks offered shade like a grandfather who wanted you to sit in it and tell him what you thought you knew so he could take it apart gently and give you new pieces. As they climbed, the river\u2014no longer neatly canal\u2014offered itself in glimpses of polish and tumble. Sid could smell it even when he could not see it, the way the nose remembers a friend on the day you mean to be dignified and are not. He nodded to the water because he had learned as a boy that talking out loud to things made your own bones listen.\n\nThe first hint of the bowl was not its shape but a quiet. It was not absence of sound so much as a shivering off of everything that could be called song. Cicadas went to ground. Flies forgot their history. The horses\u2019 ears tried to be useful and failed. After that came something like the note of a big bell rung in another valley, arriving disheveled and late, and then the taste\u2014metal, yes, but also something old that had been asleep under everything and was now adjusting to the idea that everything had been built without its consent.\n\nThey came over the lip and the circle lay below, shoulder-high to a giant, glassed in places as if some lunatic had taken an iron and smoothed the land. Dark stones gleamed like scales that had learned restraint. In the center, a depression glowed not with light but with attention. It drew the eye the way a hole in a story does. Around the edge, where the grasses had done their best to have dignity and failed, a pattern of ripple and furrow marked where sound had behaved like water. Sid wanted to kneel. He wanted to plant his palm flat on the dirt and ask so many questions that for a moment he could not think of one worth starting with.\n\n\u201cDo not speak,\u201d Tenorio said, and brought up a hand in a gesture so delicate it felt liturgical. \u201cThe earth is tuning. You wait to hear if you are wanted. Think about babies. Babies know when their crying is useful. We will be babies now and hold still like fools holding their breath.\u201d\n\nBee put her hand on her own throat as if to keep something in. Dolores folded her ledger against her chest and tried to look like a person who believed her columns would still matter in an hour. Santi closed his eyes and let the horse find balance without his help, because he had a faith in animal sense that had come from living through winter when winter meant weeks of listening to your own blood. Tomas climbed the lowest limb of an oak that leaned toward the bowl and lay along it like a thought that might be comfort if you spoke it right.\n\nThe hum came as a nothing that arranged dust. It made the hairs on Sid\u2019s arm decide to be trees in a wind. He felt it under his tongue, a new flavor, the way mint can surprise you in a stew and you cannot decide if you like the cook any better for it. The depression changed, slightly, the way a sleeping chest moves when the body underneath decides a deeper breath would help. A slow spill of small stones slid toward the center and then stopped, a minute failure that felt like mercy. The horses stamped. Mateo\u2019s hat brim trembled as if a tiny hand had flicked it and then was ashamed of the flick.\n\n\u201cWe are too close for ignorance and too far for courage,\u201d Dolores said, and the words were small and square and necessary.\n\n\u201cTake off your metal,\u201d Tenorio instructed, as if he were telling children to take off shoes before stepping onto a clean floor. \u201cCoins. Buckles. Not all of it. We are not pagans at a cousin\u2019s wedding. But the things that wish to sing with whatever this is, let them be silent. I have seen a man\u2019s tooth ring in his skull for a day after lightning made a point and he remained unconvinced. We don\u2019t argue with it. We say, excuse me, a chair for the elder.\u201d\n\nThey did as they were told in a way that might have been funny anywhere else. Kings unbuckling. Stewards loosening buttons with elaborate dissatisfaction. Fool plucking trinkets from his pockets as if they were rabbits who refused to winter. Sid took off Rosales\u2019s knife and held it for a long breath that felt like confession. He held it to his forehead and put it in the dust. He crouched and touched the ground with three fingers\u2014his father\u2019s superstition inherited without understanding\u2014and then let his hand flatten.\n\nHeat came through in a sheet that did not obey what he knew of heat. It did not scorch. It informed. He felt told. He felt like a boy sent from the table to wash his hands better. He had a violent, disorienting urge to apologize out loud to the land for every ledger, every gate, every clever well-timed release, every pride that had been dressed as planning. He swallowed and planted his hand harder as if pressure would make a different virtue.\n\n\u201cDoes it have a mouth,\u201d Bee whispered after the hum sagged into ordinary air again, then rose and then sagged, as if breathing had not yet become habit.\n\n\u201cIf it does,\u201d Tomas said from his tree, \u201cwe should be careful not to teach it how to kiss.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee there,\u201d Santi said, because there are always men who will point when a thing is too big for speech. On the far side of the depression, where the glassed soil met pale dust, a shape long and curved lay half-buried. It could have been a log, except it had the kind of geometry that logs don\u2019t learn. It had edges that remembered heat and had decided against it. It was dark like cooled forge. When the next hum lifted and the dust swam, the curve showed an under-pattern, lines like the maps the city kept, everything taking a place, and Sid had to press his hand to his mouth to not say the word he and Eryn had agreed not to teach the air.\n\n\u201cWe will not take steps toward it,\u201d Tenorio said. \u201cWe will not throw stones into this bowl as if we are children proving we exist by making ripples in another person\u2019s bath. The thing is older than our shouting. We will learn how to stand in the presence of it without breaking our own ankles.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are going to come here anyway,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cThe ones who think being first is a religion. The ones who think being right is. The ones who sell water in small cups.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will post men on the road,\u201d Sid said. He could feel how thin authority might become around a hole in the world. \u201cWe will make a circle around the circle and ask people to wait until we have a law that fits this. We will make a better law even if it must be uglier. We will tell them it hums in teeth and that should frighten anyone who uses theirs to chew their pride.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will work for an hour,\u201d Bee said. \u201cNot longer. We should talk fast inside that hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe shepherds will listen,\u201d Mateo said. \u201cNot because of you. Because we are not eager to be rearranged. Tell the orchard men that this will make bees forget their beds. That will sober them. Tell the women who keep the graves that the earth here wants to talk too loudly over them and their dead will not hear properly. That will fetch their attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell the boys there might be a thing that breathes fire and then tell them the fire burns with sound,\u201d Tomas added. \u201cThey won\u2019t know what that means and that mystery will keep them cautious for some portion of a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet me a ribbon,\u201d Sid said. He felt foolish immediately and leaned into the foolishness because sometimes you had to cross a thing to make it a bridge. \u201cAnd get me someone\u2019s hands who know knots like language.\u201d\n\nBee had already pulled a scrap from the hem of her shirt, the piece she\u2019d torn off that morning to make a band for her braid. It was yellow with a faded line of blue that once might have been flowers and now was a suggestion. She frowned at it as if it had to be argued with, then set it between her teeth and freed her hands. \u201cWhat knot do you want,\u201d she asked around the fabric.\n\n\u201cThe one a person who isn\u2019t invited recognizes from across a lot of rough water,\u201d Tomas said before Sid could admit he did not know. \u201cThe one that says, I am acting wrong in order to do a right thing.\u201d\n\nBee worked as if she had always known the right kind of wrong. Her fingers twisted and un-twisted. The ribbon became something that was not a bow and not a noose but a message in the shape of caution. She taught the knot to itself twice until it agreed to hold in both directions, then slipped it over Sid\u2019s fingers to feel how it lay. \u201cYou put it on the old canal,\u201d she said. \u201cNot where people look. Where a person who had to leave once might look when they were choosing whether to be brave again or leave again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not leave this thing to bandits,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if they wear red scarves or the bones of saints. We keep it in the ledgers if we can and in our mouths if we must.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am keeping it in my vocabulary until it changes me,\u201d Sid said. He could feel the shape of the day already choosing him and could not decide if he was relieved or afraid. \u201cTenorio, if it hums again, tell me whether it asks us to stay or go.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bowl and a wound,\u201d Tenorio said. \u201cWounds ask you to clean them and then to leave them alone. Bowls ask to be filled. We will find out which one is hungrier.\u201d\n\nThey drew back to the shade, not out of cowardice but because standing in sun with no plan makes men make bad ones. Marta of Piedra came up the road as if she had sworn the foothills to different manners and they had agreed to humor her. She was a woman with forearms like mortars and a mouth that chewed seeds a lot of the time she wasn\u2019t chewing foolishness. She spat and looked down and chewed again and spat. \u201cThis is not mine,\u201d she said with the kind of authority that made everyone want to give it to her anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s not any mason\u2019s. The lines at the edge are not from drowning in rain. I don\u2019t like it. When I don\u2019t like a thing it means men will run toward it because they want to prove me wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can taste it,\u201d Tomas suggested. \u201cTaste tells a fool what to do when his head is full of fathers.\u201d\n\nMarta crouched. She dipped two fingers in dust and touched them to her tongue. She didn\u2019t wince the way Sid wanted her to. She frowned, which was worse. \u201cThere\u2019s quarry in it. And kiln. And a little bit of burnt bird. And a flavor I don\u2019t have a word for, which makes me dislike my mother because she did not give it to me.\u201d She stood and wiped her hands on her skirt, then kicked the ground the way you kick a door to make certain a friend hears you coming. \u201cIf the stones start moving, we get everyone on the downhill side of trees. The trees will catch what they can\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nSid sent Santi and Bee back down the road with instructions like pieces of honeycomb\u2014sweet enough to carry with complaint built in. Stop at the upper pump and tell them no one draws extra. Stop at Rosales\u2019s cousin\u2019s place and tell him to tether his pigs under the oak, not the fig. I know pigs do as they please but make them please me. Bee, tie this to the old canal at the turn where the dirt has learned to lie. If a woman with a scarf comes, tell her to take off her scarf and wait where the fancy manzanita droops like the beard of a saint who has lost his humor. Do not say her name.\n\n\u201cDo not say her name like she\u2019s a curse,\u201d Bee said. She tied the ribbon into the loop of her belt like a promise. \u201cNames are only curses if you speak them with bad intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr with longing,\u201d Tomas added. \u201cLonging can ruin even a poem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will ruin no poems,\u201d Bee said, and left with Santi, who had a way of making the space around him feel durable that made gods forgive him the things he did not believe.\n\nThe circle\u2019s hum settled to a memory under noon. Heat took over as the main authority. Tenorio sat with his hands on his knees and his head tipped and told Sid stories about the times he had seen earth do something unusual and it had turned out to be small men with large ideas, and then the times he had seen it and it had turned out to be the opposite. Marta muttered to the stones as if complimenting them into complacency. Mateo stood always as if he were about to leave, a man whose home had been burnt out of him and knew it and was honest about the draft.\n\nSid slept badly and briefly, chin on chest, and woke because the air had shifted. It had picked up the smell rain has when it is only a rumor and will stay that way to punish you. The hum came again, lower this time, as if the thing in the bowl had found a different part of its chest with which to think. Birds rose from the oaks on the far ridge all at once as if they had been told a cruel joke. When the hum sank, dust did not. It hung in little columns, then fell as if someone had remembered gravity late.\n\n\u201cMen,\u201d Dolores said in the voice she used for lists when she could not bear to write them down. \u201cWe cannot own this. We can argue with it and make ourselves tired. Or we can help the ones who will be hurt when other men argue with it. I have four carts I can empty by nightfall of wheat we can spare. I will send them to the women in Lower Woodlake because their fences are already failing and whatever this is will make men less generous even if it never opens its eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what it is to be steward,\u201d Tenorio said. \u201cYou count hunger and how it moves and you move faster. You do not make speeches about the way the earth smells.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do many things at once,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cI am a woman and I am tired, so it comes naturally.\u201d\n\nWhen Bee and Santi came back by the lower road, dust to their knees, the knot was gone from Bee\u2019s belt and there was a new shadow in the company of their horses that had not yet decided whether it wanted to be a person or an idea. Eryn walked a pace behind them as if she had been there all along and only now felt like being seen. She had wrapped her hair under a gray cloth and left her throat bare, which felt like a trick until you realized it was also a kind of kindness, because it did not dare you to reach for the scarf that was not there. Her eyes came first and then the rest.\n\n\u201cI tied it as if I loved you,\u201d Bee said to Sid about the ribbon, then to Eryn because she had enough air for two honesties. \u201cAnd you came as if you loved him.\u201d\n\nEryn gave Bee a look that had salt in it and otherwise declined to answer the thing that would have made everything small. She took in the bowl, the people, the way the wind had decided to be a dog and lie down in the shade of the oaks, the men in it, the fear trying hard not to be called that. Her mouth flattened. \u201cI did not put my scarf on because I knew you would think to tie the ribbon and I knew I would make a poor entrance if I had to take it off in front of your men.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would never make a poor entrance,\u201d Tomas said. \u201cEven if you came in on your knees dragging a sack of bad fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have done that,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cIt worked. People were too busy smelling me to look to their coin. What is this.\u201d She didn\u2019t put we into it. She wasn\u2019t a fool.\n\n\u201cA bowl and a wound,\u201d Tenorio said. He rose the way old men do when they are called into being by curiosity and politeness at once. \u201cWe are deciding which is hungrier.\u201d\n\nEryn took a step forward as if she had felt the hum under her feet before she heard it. She stopped when it rose and you could see in the set of her body that she knew something about the way you held yourself when sound wanted to push your bones around. Her eyebrows winged up, not with fear, but recognition. \u201cI have heard a church like this,\u201d she said softly. \u201cFar south. The stones had a music when you pressed your ear against them. A woman there told me that everything hums if you love it long enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this wants love the way it hums,\u201d Dolores said, \u201cthen I don\u2019t wish to know the word for its hate.\u201d\n\nEryn\u2019s gaze moved to Sid and skipped his crown as if it were not there, which it was not, and landed on his mouth. He felt himself become the wrong kind of visible. \u201cDo not say the word we both didn\u2019t,\u201d she warned. \u201cI can feel you readying it like a spoon. Don\u2019t feed it your certainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not certain of anything,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are only a crowd of different fears around a hole.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and went to the lip the way a person goes to a dock at night to throw stolen bread to fish because it feels like priesting even if God would quibble about the details. She knelt and placed her hand on the glassed earth and closed her eyes. For a horrible moment Sid imagined the hum rising and taking her skin the way fire takes hair and he put his hand on the knife he had removed and found himself with nothing to hold. The hum did rise. She flinched. She did not move away. When it sank, she took her hand back and the part of her palm that had touched the ground shone faintly as if she\u2019d pressed it into a coin.\n\n\u201cThat is not only heat,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is a thing I do not have words for, which makes me hungry. You can feel it asking. The way a place that\u2019s about to become a town asks men to name their streets before anyone has built a house. It wants to be called. It wants to stop being a thing that only happens and be a thing that is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens when you name a thing like this,\u201d Marta asked. \u201cCarts roll in and men argue about who will pay for the stones. Then a man like me is asked to mark it so that when it tears it will tear along the line they thought they wanted.\u201d\n\nEryn looked up at the oak where Tomas lounged. \u201cSing something,\u201d she demanded. \u201cNothing clever. A work song. A woman washing a shirt. A child being told to sleep. I want to hear the way it moves against the hum.\u201d\n\nTomas glowered like a cat given a bath and then sang. He didn\u2019t have a voice you would put on a square for coins. He had a voice that sounded like rope, notched and trustworthy. He sang a line his mother had sung about soap you make when you are poor and happy with your poverty, and a line his father had sung about mules and bad deals and the way the sky takes the heat and does not return it as a favor, and a line he had made up about his own mouth. The hum threaded through it like a second singer who refused to harmonize and still could not be said to be out of tune. Dust lifted in thin prayer flags. A lizard ran slower than it wished to and then remembered what running was and sped.\n\n\u201cWe can get out of this alive,\u201d Eryn said, and it was the first generous thing she\u2019d said all day. \u201cBut it will tilt everything. The men who want to own it will come. The poets will too, and they are sometimes worse. The women with babies will wonder if the babies\u2019 sleep will change and if it does they will blame and forgive the wrong people for a while. You need to make a law that is an apology and a dare at once.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can write a law that stumbles toward that,\u201d Dolores said. \u201cBut it will last as long as you and your hum behave. We need something that stands when flour is scarce and when there is too much flour and men grow greedy with bread.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will write something that says no fires within two fields,\u201d Tenorio said, turning the world into the language he trusted. \u201cYou will write something that says no digging here unless a woman who has put her ear to stones says yes. You will send boys up the old road to stop pilgrims from throwing bottles that break into knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you will send word to the coastal kings,\u201d Ajit\u2019s voice said from behind them, and they all turned, because he had said he would stay and in that way men remind you that promises are elastic when true fear stretches them. He looked embarrassed and not sorry. \u201cI cannot fix a gate if half the men who know the counterweights have gone up into the hills to see a thing that hums. I will send boys if you cannot send men. And you will tell the people by the salt that we are not hoarding a miracle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are not calling it that,\u201d Sid said. \u201cWe are calling it a problem that requires singing and rope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will call it whatever you like at the courthouse,\u201d Ajit said, arms folded, two missing fingers curled toward his palm as if they were listening still. \u201cIn the market it will be miracle even if it eats a goat for breakfast. We can manage gates. We can\u2019t manage mouths. But we tell them a thing loud and often and some of them will pretend to believe it for a while.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon laid its weight on them like a polite aunt who means to smother. A wind came up and set the oak leaves speaking in their dry consonants. From down the hill a thin river of people began to arrive, the curious and the careful and the ones who had been told to stand here and not there and were midway through deciding what they thought about being told in general. Sid found himself standing always half between the bowl and the people, as if the middle position could translate anything into kindness. He let the pattern of the work take him. Answer a question. Detour a boy who wanted to throw a rock, away not only from the bowl but from the future he would make for himself if no one taught him how not to enjoy breaking. Let an old woman with a needle-box touch his sleeve until she remembered why she\u2019d come. Ask Mateo if he wanted to walk or sit. Send Bee to the canal with the ribbon because even if Eryn stood here now you had to honor the version of her that had not known if she would choose to.\n\nBy sunset the circle had not opened and the hum had come and gone in waves like a stubborn tide. Men had drawn closer than Tenorio liked and been pushed back not by any visible threat but by a feeling in their knees that told them the bones involved in standing were reconsidering their allegiances. Fires had been lit too near and then kicked out with bad language. Laws had been invented and argued. Tomas had sung again and then spoken a story about a fish who wanted to climb a tree and when he got to the part where the fish understood who he was and stopped trying to be anything else a woman cried and pretended it was because smoke had gotten in her eye.\n\nNight made the bowl a shape the eye could not understand. It ate light around its edges. It gave back stars in the center as if something had polished them. The hum, when it came, vibrated the visible world less and climbed instead up into people\u2019s skulls and announced that it could sit there if it wanted. Eryn stood with her hands in the pockets of her cut-down coat and watched the dark as if it were a chessboard full of pieces she had never seen before but was confident she could learn.\n\n\u201cThis is going to call men to themselves,\u201d she said to Sid, when they had contrived a corner of conversation at the margin of shadows. \u201cSome will like who they are. Some will not. The ones who do not will get loud. The ones who do will get quiet and do the work. You need to find those before the other ones start naming the days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I had brought more people who know how to make soup for a crowd,\u201d Sid said. He had cleaned three noses bled by humming and said the right thing twice and the wrong thing once and been forgiven in the way kings are forgiven when the one hearing them is tired. \u201cSoup keeps men from philosophy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoup is philosophy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt says we have heat and time and someone cared enough to stir. It says we are staying at least long enough to eat and that means the world hasn\u2019t ended. Make soup in the yard if you want to stay king.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will send for bags of split peas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd salt that doesn\u2019t taste like it comes with a sermon.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be good at this,\u201d she said, and her mouth made a shape he had not seen yet, a warning that had something kind under it. \u201cIf you are good at this men will start bringing you their holes and ask you to hum for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am tired of being good at anything,\u201d he said, and it was not a king\u2019s truth and because of that it felt like one I-beam in a building not yet decided on.\n\nFrom the bowl came a breath unlike the others, a filling that changed the pitch of the night. The oak leaves froze without wind. A ring of dew showed in a place no dew had any business appearing, and then a line of light ran around the depression like a snake made of an old word that had just remembered itself. Every throat in the company clicked or tightened or swallowed or failed to, depending on its history. The curve they had seen earlier shifted and the dust showed a lattice where another curve lay under it in the opposite direction, and for a second the pattern lifted out of the earth in a way that made men remember why people had bothered inventing gods.\n\n\u201cBack,\u201d Tenorio said, although no one had moved forward. \u201cBack,\u201d he repeated, and they obeyed the old man as men obey a tide table.\n\nSid felt something wanting in him go to its knees and apologize and change. He did not know what it had been wanting to start with. He also did not speak the word Eryn had forbidden him. He kept his mouth at being a human thing and not an altar. The light went out not like a candle but like breath deciding it was done. The hum went low and lower and then away, and the world slid back into its previous wrongness. Someone laughed too loud at nothing and then covered his mouth as if the laugh might draw attention. Someone else prayed in a language Sid did not know and had never heard inside city walls.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d Dolores said, which was such an act of faith that Sid had to turn his face away so she would not see what that word did to him. \u201cWe will set the tents here and here. We will send a boy with a back that can be trusted to the salt road. We will choose three words to say at market and not more. We will appoint two people to listen and say no. We will write a sign that uses simple nouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will also go down at first light to the lower farms,\u201d Ajit added, softer. \u201cBecause the men there will take advantage of the city\u2019s eyes pointing uphill. We do not allow men to drink with both hands while they are being watched by God and dragons.\u201d\n\nHe had said it. The word had been said in a way that was almost a joke and not a joke, and it hung for a breath in the night and then became part of it.\n\nEryn looked at Sid, and there was that small, awful, private happiness again that someone else\u2019s mouth knew the same shape your mouth wanted. She touched his elbow, which was not a promise and not permission. \u201cDo not say that in the hall,\u201d she advised. \u201cSave it for here when your mouth is of no consequence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI usually save my worst words for the places where they will do me the least harm,\u201d he said. \u201cI am learning to do the opposite. It seems necessary to both survive and be worth surviving.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d she said, amused and almost fond and furious with herself for both. \u201cTrying to survive and matter at once. It will tire you past your marrow.\u201d\n\nThey kept watch. They made a circle of bodies around the circle of ground. They took turns sleeping on their sides like simple animals. Sid lay with his ear pressed to the earth at one point because something in him wanted to hear the hum the way a child hears a mother through a wall. He heard nothing but the breathing of his men and the shift and creak of oaks and the small astonished noises horses make when they have dreamed. He thought about the year Eryn had asked for and whether that year would mean anything against the shape under the ground. He thought about soup. He thought about tying ribbons to water and learning new knots. He thought about his father saying you can make anything into something else if you hammer long enough and wondered if this would forgive being hammered.\n\nBefore dawn a thin layer of ash had fallen over the lip away from the wind, a thing that looked like snow in a story told by a liar and a mother who wanted to comfort her child. It made footprints sharp. It held a record of the way the raccoons had come, curious and rude, and then left offended in their raccoon way. Sid stood and took a breath and held it as if the day would start when he released. It did not. It started when Bee\u2019s shadow fell long and she said, from beside him where her mouth was too simple to lie. \u201cThere are men on the lower road with salt armor,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd a flag with a clam drawn on it in a way that thinks clams are proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cCoastal,\u201d Dolores said with more punctuation than some essays.\n\n\u201cToo early,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cWe have not decided our words and already they are delivering theirs. They will want to make a harbor out of your bowl. They will want to put their boats in it and call it a blessing even if the boats have no water to float on.\u201d She fixed her scarfless throat with her hand as if to remind it that she still belonged to herself. \u201cWe should go be clever, then. It\u2019s a day for it.\u201d\n\nSid picked up his coat. His boots found their own feet. He felt the copper crown at home on the courthouse windowsill as if it were a small animal he had failed and would have to explain to later. He thought about soup again and about the shape under the earth and the taste of metal and the way Eryn had said his name and made it into something he nearly wanted to be. He squared his shoulders, which was ridiculous because shoulders are not squares, and smiled without showing teeth, which was a practice that had taken him a year to learn and had saved him three times.\n\n\u201cWe will go see,\u201d he said, and this time when he said it there was no one there who needed reminding that this was what he knew how to do. They went down toward the lower road as a small band, into the shadows made by things bigger than they were, and he felt the city behind him and the bowl at his back, and it was like walking away from a lit room that might burn and knowing you would come back no matter what the men with clams thought they could claim by arriving early.",

                              "content": "They found the coastal men where the lower road swung through a stand of valley oaks that had learned to drink deep and not talk about it. You could smell the sea before you saw them. It was a scent that did not belong to this land: salt dried on skin so many times it became a second hide, tar and old rope and the faint licorice of fennel seeds men chew against nausea. Their armor was white at first glance, but it was not purity; it was salt, cured onto boiled leather until the plates clicked like teeth. The flag with the clam was more elaborate than the countryside deserved, painted in pearl pigment so the creature\u2019s shell threw off little parings of light and its hinge had been shaded by someone who had loved a hinge too much. They had brought a cleric in a blue stole whose God preferred horizons and did not sit well in rooms. They had brought a chest you could smell the coins in even from horseback.\n\nThe leader, whether named that by his men or by himself, came forward with the tall man\u2019s ease of one who sails more than walks and liked being taller than people who worked in dirt. He wore his hair plaited with strips of dried eel that had been worked to shine like leather, and his thumb bore a ring carved from a whalebone\u2019s whorl. \u201cLord Sid of the Copper,\u201d he said, the way you address a neighbor whose dog has started killing your chickens and you intend to be just. \u201cWe were told by the traveling kind\u2014tinker, washer, a woman with a tattoo of a fish on her throat\u2014that a phenomenon of interest has woken in your jurisdiction. Sea laws apply in cases of phenomena. We are obliged to offer assistance and, in return, maintain a share in the naming rights.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy jurisdiction prefers plows to phenomena,\u201d Sid replied, pleasantly enough to be a danger. He did not give the man his title back. He did not say, I know your sort, gone inland to remind it there is a horizon it does not own. He did not say, you are late, because lateness was sometimes the only manner left to men who had everything else. \u201cAnd the only naming rights that apply belong to the people whose teeth have been humming since yesterday. They would like to be asked before you put your clam on it.\u201d\n\nThe coastal leader\u2019s eyes did what eyes do when a man feels he has been spoken to as an equal by someone he thought needed his pronunciation, narrowing and then opening as if the sun had come out at an awkward time. \u201cWe don\u2019t plant clams,\u201d he said, affront making his vowels saltier. \u201cWe plant banners to warn men not to drown. We are here to prevent. You inlanders are fond of pretending things are not happening until they have met your fence. The sea does not offer fences. It offers advice. Listen, then. If what you have is a vent, we cinch it. If it\u2019s a sink, we measure it, we chart it, we forbid washing clothes in it until we say you may. If it is a saint\u2019s mouth, we build a chapel. We share tithe.\u201d\n\nDolores rode a pace up and cut in with that particular thin politeness that makes men think of paper cuts. \u201cIf it\u2019s a saint\u2019s mouth,\u201d she said, \u201cyou will donate shingles and we will ask the saint if she prefers a roof.\u201d She looked the man\u2019s armor up and down as if pricing it in her head. \u201cIf it is a vent, you dump enough salt on it to kill three fields, and you do not make it as far as the second tree before men who planted those fields cut your elk-leather to feed their children. If it\u2019s a sink, there will be no charts until you learn that a map can scorch a land as efficiently as fire. We have rules already on the road up. You will follow them or you will dine with your clam under the bridge and your men can sing you to sleep.\u201d\n\nEryn had hung back because she made a point of not being a member of anyone\u2019s we unless she agreed to it out loud in the morning light. Now she slid forward until she was where the coastal men could fail to see her by thinking about anything else. Her scarf was gray as cloud on a day when the sea means something and knows you think it does. \u201cYou people,\u201d she said, looking past them at the flag because sometimes you have to speak to a thing that believes it is a person, \u201cbuild churches where something leaks and call it reverence. Then you sell blessing by the scoop. This is not your leak. You can stay if you can be quiet. I doubt you can. But surprise me. That\u2019s a dare you will not resist.\u201d\n\nThe cleric with the blue stole had the sort of face that becomes more itself when someone needs him to be reasonable. He stood with his hands folded so that the ring on his forefinger\u2014the one with the tiny fish engraved on the band, chasing its tail\u2014showed. \u201cWe can bless without owning,\u201d he said, and you could tell he had practiced that sentence in different towns and been met with laughter or prayer according to weather. \u201cWe can stand at a distance and say no words. Sometimes the saying of no words is a blessing. We have an oath for that. It is very short.\u201d\n\nTomas, who had been whittling nothing into the shape of something while leaning against a fencepost that did not need his company, dropped a curl of wood and smiled at the cleric in a way that said you might drink soup with me one day. \u201cI know that oath,\u201d he said. \u201cIt goes mmhmm. Can your men mmhmm with salt on their teeth.\u201d\n\nThe coastal leader lifted the band of his flag to avoid a puddle that had been there since January because a broken culvert argued with gravity at that turn and always won. He glanced at the hill as if it had been promised to him across a table. Perhaps it had. The whalebone ring tapped his thigh and made a sound like wooden cutlery in a drawer. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to quarrel with farmers,\u201d he said, and that was a sentence that usually preceded quarrel. \u201cWe want to be recorded in the story as the men who came inland and told you how not to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could start by listening to how we\u2019ve managed that so far,\u201d Sid said. \u201cWe will walk together, and I will tell you what not to do. You will nod and stay behind a rope that a girl tied and you will not laugh because her knots hold like a mother\u2019s. You will not plant your flag in dirt and you will not write any word down until it has been said aloud by a woman who has put her ear to stone. If you can manage these courtesies, we will give you soup. If you cannot, you will eat salt and say it was your intention.\u201d\n\nAjit, who had come despite his promise and was now owning his usefulness the way a man carries a third pail in his teeth and pretends it keeps his mouth from mischief, cleared his throat. \u201cYou want to see this thing,\u201d he told the coastal men. \u201cFine. We\u2019ve gone up twice now and it hasn\u2019t eaten us but it has made our hair stand up like we were boys again. It hums in bone. Your armor will hum, and it will make your men uneasy and they\u2019ll take off pieces and you\u2019ll yell and then they\u2019ll put them back on and start making jokes that spill. If anyone throws anything, I will throw him. I lost two fingers to a chain and I miss them like sons. I will keep all the rest of my fingers by keeping your men alive. You don\u2019t like being spoken to like donkeys. Good. Learn to be loved like them instead.\u201d\n\nThey went together, a river of bad expectations braided with good behavior because men can be surprising when watched by a saint and by bandits and by a king who is trying not to learn new postures of apology. The coastal flag brought down the birds. The cleric hated that. He looked up at the oak with his jaw set and then told his flag man to hang back. The road narrowed where buckbrush piled its green into a barricade, and the salt armor scraped against ceanothus with the sound of winter gravel under municipal boots. It was almost comic if you had never been made to listen to a man fail at grace and call the failure weather.\n\nAt the first rope\u2014Bee\u2019s work, stretched around a stand of scrub and through a pair of wedge-shaped boulders as if it had grown there\u2014Sid stopped and the others did as well because they had the sense to recognize a threshold. Bee had knotted it with an idea inside. The knot did not want you to pass. It wanted you to learn how to ask. Eryn bent to look at it and you could see her pleasure in the way a small, right thing can stand instead of a cannon. \u201cWho taught you this,\u201d she asked Bee without looking away, which is how praise works in places where it has not been cheapened.\n\n\u201cA woman who ran away and ran back,\u201d Bee said. \u201cShe told me you tie like this when you want to let someone think they found the way on their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour teacher was a liar who loved you,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cBetter than most teachers.\u201d She straightened and tapped the rope with her knuckles. \u201cThe rule says what it says. You stay behind this. You can see from here. No, old man, it won\u2019t be enough for you,\u201d she added to the coastal leader, whose eyes had placed a flag a long time ago and were now negotiating with his mouth about how to praise the view while thinking of nails. \u201cBut it will keep you civil while you come up with flattery that sounds like a treaty.\u201d\n\nThey stood in a new geometry. The bowl lay ahead wearing late morning like a shawl someone had left on its shoulders and then been too afraid to go back for. Tenorio sat again with his ear turned, a weather vane made of expectation and tendon. Marta of Piedra had arranged three stones by her knee as a model of what she wanted the bigger stones to consider, and was explaining to them in patient detail how not to disgrace themselves when the hum came, because if she treated them like men some of them might endeavor to be like better ones. The coastal men spread out along the line that had been drawn for them by a girl, and it did something to them that years of discipline had not achieved. It made them humble by telling them it was a choice.\n\nThe hum rose like steam finds a gap in a lid. Sid had prepared himself for it in the way you prepare for a slap now that you love the person who has always been the one to deliver it. He kept his mouth shut and still. The coastal men failed and got better on the second breath. Armor shivered. A ring of dew rose again where no dew belonged and the cleric made a sound of disobedient awe he would later call unseemly and blame on the dryness. The curve showed itself and then the under-curve and in that doubling something like a lattice unrolled in the dust and went away, and the coastal leader took one half-step without meaning to. The rope held. He did not push it. He did not call for his flag. He cursed, in a manner that would have pleased any inland grandmother; it was clean and admitted the man\u2019s mother would be disappointed.\n\n\u201cWhat will you name that,\u201d the cleric whispered, forgetting that he had insisted on no words as blessing. \u201cWhat name fits without running over its edges.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone you brought,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cNone you rode in with. You have sea words and church words and words for spices traded by men who think a market is a war you can win with a list. None of those will lie properly against this shape. If you wait till it speaks in something like sense, you will earn a syllable. If you jump and plant your clam, we will take it away from you, politely, the way a woman takes glass out of a child\u2019s mouth.\u201d\n\nTomas took the cleric\u2019s blue stole in two fingers and moved it one inch away from the fringe of the rope where it had been about to trespass. \u201cYou pray,\u201d he advised, unnecessarily and exactly. \u201cNot to it. Not for it. In spite of it. To keep your own song steady while this one tries to climb inside your head and conduct.\u201d\n\nDolores had produced from nowhere a slate and on it she had written three sentences, each in words as short as her patience and twice as durable. No fire. No going past rope. No digging by anyone until a stone-listener says yes. She had a chalk nub that left dust on her fingertips and she wiped the dust on her skirt and the white streaks there were as fair as lace to her. She told a boy to take the slate to the lower crossing and she told a girl to take it to the upper and she told both that if anyone laughed at their size they should invent a new curse and use it twice, once for practice and once for conviction.\n\nThe coastal leader looked at Sid with the face of a man who admits to himself that a morning has gone another way than he dreamed it and still intends to sleep well later. \u201cWe will not plant a flag,\u201d he said, the words not pleasing him as they came out and therefore proving they were the right ones. \u201cWe will stand behind the girl\u2019s rope and we will watch a while. We will send a letter with your man to our city and ask for stones that can listen, if you allow that, and men who do not insult the inlanders\u2019 air by breathing it like the last of something. We will leave our cleric in your keeping so you can see we mean it. He is not a hostage. He is a witness, which is worse if a man knows what a witness can do.\u201d\n\nSid allowed the least smile. It was the one that said good, I have not had to lie yet, and perhaps today I will sleep in my own bed next to the sound of something not singing. \u201cLeave your cleric if he likes our soup,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will mean more to me than your letter. We will share watch and notes. But you will not name things at market. You will not tell men who sell beans that this will bring back the sea. If you do, I will come to your coast and I will sell almonds and call them pearls and I will embarrass you so thoroughly your whalebones will blush.\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s whalebone ring tapped his thigh again as if it had an opinion and was trying to introduce it. He exhaled. \u201cI am Lord Baeza of the Tidemark,\u201d he said, as if giving his name was a concession and an admission and an offering. \u201cIf your soup is brined like the last time I ate in this valley, I will insult you in return by teaching your cook to use salt with grace.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoup is already boiling in the upper shade,\u201d Bee reported over her shoulder, as if this had been the plan all month. \u201cSplit peas and a ham joint and a handful of that green that grows where it shouldn\u2019t. Two onions. No sermons in the salt. If you don\u2019t like it there is bread. If you don\u2019t like the bread you can go chew your banner.\u201d\n\nMarta had set three cauldrons on stones and announced the law of the soup as if it had been handed down to Moses in the dust: a ladle is a ruler and you do not let any man measure himself longer than anyone else with it. Ajit had wheedled two goatskins of extra water from the upper pump by saying he would name his next son after the spring. The women from Lower Woodlake had come with turnips and grief and were tending both in the same way, slow and stirring. When Lord Baeza tasted the soup he made the face of a man who has discovered his prejudice is not only foolish but a joke passed around avidly by the people he had thought to impress. He nodded. The cleric\u2019s mouth softened into the shape that means this is not the worst place God ever invented and perhaps He knew what He was doing when He put the river here.\n\n\u201cWrite your letter,\u201d Dolores told Lord Baeza, because she was disinclined to let a man feel good for long without asking him to work. \u201cSay you watched a hole refuse your flag and thought about your mother. Tell them not to send a bell tower. Tell them to send rope, thirty coils, and men who will not piss near oak. We have our own piss. We don\u2019t need yours dressing up as aid.\u201d She had her ledger out without seeming to and took down what she was owed in a neat hand that had frightened men into paying debts their grandfathers had stolen.\n\nWhile men learned obedience to a girl\u2019s rope and while soup became the philosophy of a crowd, Sid stood with Eryn under the lower oak where the ground still remembered the feet of a particular boy who had hid there with pears and a knife to carve his name into them so that when he ate he would also have taken a little of himself into himself. He had the ribbon Bee had tied in his mind and the knot had become a way of thinking. \u201cYou came when I asked,\u201d he said, which is an accusation in a thousand small countries because it reveals the ask was heard.\n\nShe adjusted the cuff of her coat with an attention that had saved her life more than once. \u201cI came because I don\u2019t like losing the ability to surprise myself. I also came because men with salt in their ears are loud and you needed a woman in gray to stand to your left and make this look like more than farmers trying dignity on. Do not write me into your ledger as a kindness.\u201d She tilted her head toward the bowl where the hum had gone quiet as if exhausted by introducing itself. \u201cI sent two of mine up the north slope last night, past Piedra and on toward the old jam factory. They heard another song. Not the same note. A different jaw.\u201d Her mouth made a shape she lent only to true confession. \u201cIf this is a mouth, it is part of a set. If this is a wound, it was made with a tool that likes to work in pairs.\u201d\n\nHe watched her face while she said it and could not decide if he was glad to discover that fear had a shape he could hold or if he was being handed a map without creeks. \u201cSecond,\u201d he said. The word sat in the air like a brick waiting to become a corner. \u201cThen the law we make today will be tested tomorrow by men who don\u2019t like waiting twice for anything. Then we need more rope, more soup, more jokes, more ways to say no without making it a war.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps also more beds that are not for sleep,\u201d she said, deliberate and then not, because she had not meant to say it and needed him to know this was the part of her that said true things when she was bone-tired. \u201cBecause tired men become greedy for absolutes. If you avert two fights with a woman\u2019s mouth or a man\u2019s hand that has nothing to do with knives, you save a life. Put your jester in charge of the quiet corners. Make him hand out threads for people to braid so their hands will not want to throw.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make Tomas a priest of making the middle bearable,\u201d Sid said. He did not let the image bloom and take his day. He kept it folded, like a letter you do not read again because the first time did something to your chest. \u201cCan you go north and come back before night makes the world lie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can go north and come back if the world keeps its current bargains,\u201d Eryn said. \u201cThe world owes me little. But I can collect on small debts. I will send a boy with a ribbon if I find a second bowl and he will tie it to the old gate at Piedra at the notch where you can\u2019t see it unless you work with your hands. If I don\u2019t send him, assume I am taking on work that has me for supper.\u201d She touched her fingers to his shoulder and took them away again because she had learned that sometimes the body doesn\u2019t know how to stop asking. \u201cDo not make a speech,\u201d she advised. \u201cMen remember the wrong sentences. Simply say we are not naming anything until it tells us its name and then show them you can hold your tongue in your teeth. If you bleed a little from doing it, so much the better. People believe blood.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to ask her what to name the second note if it was a jaw and how many jaws these hills could host before the city below them became one long mouth laughing itself into ruin. He wanted to tell her about his father cursing the water for being exactly as it should be, which is to say, without pity, and how he had inherited that kind of love and was trying to dress it in mercy. He wanted, which was becoming a real thing he had to reckon with, to put the ribbon she had not worn into her hair himself and be content with that action, small and ceremonial and useless against geology. He said instead, \u201cNo speeches. Soup. Rope. Girls who tie better than kings hold. That is my plan and I will lie to no one about the parts of it that are luck.\u201d\n\nBy late afternoon the coastal men had learned to keep their weight back from the rope as if it could bite. The cleric had managed three mmhmms with grace and without performing sanctity for an audience; it made Sid look at him with the particular suspicion he reserved for decent men. Lord Baeza had taken his salt ring off for a while, because the hum made it ache in a way he would be embarrassed to describe to anyone, and he had hidden it in his pocket like an unwise letter. He had also taken a second bowl of soup and smiled at Bee with unwilling brotherhood after she salted it with a pinch from a horn she kept tucked in her boot. Tenorio had coaxed two shepherds into admitting what they had heard last winter near Piedra that they had not repeated because it had been the sort of noise you felt foolish connecting to anything. Marta had measured the slope with a string, a pebble, and patience, and drawn a triangle in the dust that made young men admire math.\n\nThen the hum changed. It came low and then lower, and then another note rose, not harmony, not discord, but intersection. It came from the north. It came from a place that had not yet been asked to behave. Birds did the wrong thing in the wrong order. A coyote appeared on the ridge like an illustration of an idea and sat down and wove its ears in a figure eight and looked affronted at a world it had been counting on to be consistent. Men looked at each other the way men do when someone has suggested doing a dangerous thing together and their spines all try to leap up inside their skin in excitement and dread.\n\nEryn was already moving. She had not brought her mare into the first bowl because she had not been asked to and because there were promises made this morning she intended to honor at least until she had to break them. Now she whistled a note that came not from her throat but from the part of her mouth that had taught itself to be bird and thief and woman and girl. The gray mare came from behind a stand of willow where Santi had been trying to make a friend and failed because the mare did not think much of friendship in the middle of a crowd. Eryn put a hand to the horse\u2019s neck and the animal put her head down to the knee and stood for the rope as if it had learned rope language and understood it was a treaty. She did not look back at Sid as she mounted. That would have made the thing sentimental and therefore less likely to end in survival. She looked ahead, and the mare shared her attention respectfully. She said a word that was not a name but would answer like one, and they went.\n\n\u201cNorth,\u201d Sid said, not to no one, never to no one, because he had learned that kings who said things to no one were unwell. \u201cTomas, take Bee and Santi and Marta as far as the second bend and make a gate out of brush so the men who cannot stand not being first will find it hard to ruin themselves. Ajit, stand at the road and tell the next person who arrives that they have to hold someone\u2019s hand before they can see anything and if they argue make them hold yours. They will learn humility and perhaps something about the worth of missing fingers. Dolores, I will write your name on a board so the boys we send to Woodlake can say something that sounds like law when they run with it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will sit and drink water,\u201d Dolores said, because a steward\u2019s job is to put water into the hands of whatever idiot is about to make the right decision at great cost. She thrust a skin at him that she had tied with Bee\u2019s knot. He took it and tied it back to himself, and that loop across his shoulder felt like belonging and a collar and like every promise he had not known he made and would try to keep.\n\nThey could not leave the first bowl to go to the second without deciding what to call it in their mouths. They agreed on almost nothing except one thing, and that was that they would not teach it a name yet. The cleric wrote the not-name on his hand in invisible ink. Lord Baeza placed his ring back on and said a thing in his own language that had no vowels and made Ajit smile despite himself. Tenorio patted the ground as if he approved it for temporary occupation by idiots. Sid turned his face north and did not think about all the parts of him he was leaving on the hill tied to knots and ledgers and soup pots and men who thought they knew what a clam could do.\n\nThe lower road made a bend that had taught a thousand carts to be careful or to become stories. When they reached it, Bee and Tomas and Marta and Santi took apart a fence and wove it with brush into a gate that looked like it had been there all along and would only move for the hands of people who understood it, which is to say, people who would survive the next hour. They left two boys at it with hard candy and the authority of having been spoken to by Dolores. Meanwhile, Sid and a smaller group went on at a pace that made the horses lift their heads and remember they used to run for fun when they were wild and unshod. The light, this late, had an orange opinion about how far they should get and when they should turn back, and he ignored it because the note was still in his teeth and had to be investigated.\n\nThey found the second place before they saw it. It had the smell of old iron in rain even without rain. The grass had crouched, not laid down, as if expecting to be beaten without reason. The sound, when it came, was thinner, younger, a filament instead of a rope, and yet it threaded a man\u2019s knees into his jaw exactly as efficiently. Eryn stood on a low rock with her mare\u2019s rein in her hand and her head turned as if listening with the back of her neck. She glanced at Sid like a thief checking whether a boy would hold water in a paper bucket. He would.\n\nThis bowl was shallower; a dent, a cupping palm, not a mouth. The glass at the edges was not ironed as smoothly as the first; it was blistered, as if something had tried to come up and then forgot why. In the center, there was no curve. There was a straight piece of something black as any come-up-from-fire thing counts as black. It was not wood. It was not stone. It had edges like a tool and a skin like a secret.\n\n\u201cJaw,\u201d Tomas said under his breath, because fools name things quietly where kings refuse to.\n\n\u201cSpare your labels,\u201d Eryn said, but without any real heat left in her, because the word had a way of thinking itself into a man\u2019s mouth whether or not his better mind wanted it to.\n\nDolores arrived with a pencil that had been whittled down to resentment and a slate that had not. She began herself to write the same three rules and then added a fourth that made even the cleric nod without irony: No names until the hum says yes. She underlined it because underlining made men stop and squint and therefore gave them time to improve.\n\nNight wanted them back at the first bowl where the soup smelled like a town doing its best. The second bowl wanted them to make a second camp and divide their company and their attention and their claims. Eryn said, as if she had not thought about it until three seconds ago and of course she had, \u201cI will stay here with two of mine and Santi if he will. Bee goes back to feed people and sleep and tell jokes badly. Your jester stays where he can be seen because he keeps men from lighting fires just to see a glow. Your old man who listens to stone will split himself into advice and send some here with me and keep some for you and then sleep on his side so his ear is on the good earth. You, Sid, go back and be seen going back. People stay sensible when they can visualize a king\u2019s posture.\u201d\n\nHe considered refusing. He considered it as a petty thing and a large, stubborn, boyish thing. He let it go because he had enough stubborn in him for the part where he had to tell Lord Baeza to keep his flag rolled. He put his hand on Eryn\u2019s forearm just a little lower than most men would, in the place that means I know you can break this limb and take my life with it if you think I will become a story you cannot stand. \u201cIf anything hums wrong,\u201d he said, which was meaningless and therefore useful, \u201cwhistle the way you did for the mare. I will hear it in my teeth.\u201d\n\nShe said, \u201cDo not love me by being useful at unuseful distances,\u201d which was cruel and kind and more honest than she owed him, and made a shape with her mouth that was almost a blessing and then wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe stars came up as if mocked by the glass they had to compete with and tried hard and succeeded because stars are patient and hold grudges well. The valley down below made its noises and could not be coaxed into silence; there were parties and fights and births and one marriage that had been on again off again for three years and had decided now was as good a time as any for another try. The first bowl glowed in minds as people fell asleep. The second bowl did the same in the throats of those who hadn\u2019t seen it yet; that was a particular cruelty, to dream of shapes you didn\u2019t know and wake up knowing too much.\n\nSid walked back in the dark with Bee half-asleep on her horse and Tomas telling the low version of a joke to keep coyotes and men who wanted to be coyotes from thinking they owned the path. Ajit matched his stride, and the missing fingers were quiet. \u201cTwo,\u201d Ajit said finally, not because it needed saying but because sometimes a word stops two men from becoming statues. \u201cWe have two. We\u2019ll have a third. That\u2019s the way of things, like gates. They go in threes because men flatter themselves they invent symmetry.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet it not be a third,\u201d Sid said, but without asking gods to intervene because he had already asked them to notice too much today. \u201cLet it be the other half of a jaw if it must, and then a rest and an apology. We will not manage a third. We will manage two because we are already failing at managing one and we have proven ourselves capable of arithmetic.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will sleep,\u201d Ajit insisted, which he had no right to do and all the right. \u201cYou will put your head down in the room that makes you think of both your parents and you will not dream of edges. If you wake, you will not go to the window. You will go to your table and you will try to write a word for this and your pencil will break and you will take that as a sign and you will go back to bed. In the morning you will convene people and make a law that has soup in it. Put soup into law and you will cut arrests by a third.\u201d\n\n\u201cSoup is an expensive statute,\u201d Sid said, and then, because he had learned to be grateful when his friends made his mouth find jokes after a day that could have drowned it, \u201cWe will write it in the ledgers in the ink that doesn\u2019t run when a man cries into it.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse the old ink,\u201d Ajit said. \u201cThe cheap that stains everything.\u201d He blew out a breath through pursed lips and made a tune of it that Tomas took up with a hum not unlike the bowl\u2019s smallest moment. \u201cTwo,\u201d he repeated, and this time it had become a plan rather than a counting.\n\nBy the time they reached the yard under the tower the soup was down to thick edges and the last of it stuck to the side of the cauldron the way childhood sticks to a man who didn\u2019t mean to carry it. Lord Baeza had not left. He had taken off his armor as far as decency could bear and was sitting with a woman from Lower Woodlake who was telling him a story about her son that contained no lesson he could use and would nevertheless alter how he spoke to men with blue stoles for a month. The cleric had found Tomas and the two of them had invented a game with pebbles and a circle and a lie, and they were cheating each other so elegantly that men who had been prepared to distrust both found themselves charmed and annoyed into a kind of peace.\n\nDolores put her hand on Sid\u2019s wrist and squeezed once because an agreement had been made that they would not startle each other in public with anything like tenderness. \u201cIn the morning,\u201d she said, \u201cwe tell men where to stand. We tell them what not to call it. We tell them that if they throw anything in, we will throw them in, and we say it like a jest so the ones who need to laugh can laugh and the ones who need to be afraid can find that in it. We tell them soup is law. Then you will sit and listen and say no three times and yes once, and then we will go to the second place and begin again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will also find a quiet corner for men who would otherwise make trouble,\u201d Sid said. \u201cTomas, you are now the master of misdirection. You will lay out cloth and thread and the bones children like to string on cords, and you will say you are teaching men to make offerings because it will make them feel holy and therefore decent for twenty minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always been a priest,\u201d Tomas said, not bothering to rise to the bait because he knew his collar was a laugh. \u201cOf the middle. Of the place between jokes and tears. Bring me old women with needles and young boys with pocketknives. I will save your law more effectively than anything written. I will even bless the salt man if he gives me a decent shell to hold candies.\u201d\n\nLord Baeza raised his shell as if toasting from a distance without the sin of toasting with water. \u201cI have a clam for you,\u201d he said, and smiled a smile that would be a good one if he earned it. \u201cPerhaps, wilderness willing, this place will not make me a worse man. That is more than I expected when I got up this morning and put my salt on.\u201d\n\nSid would sleep. He would be loved improperly by the air that came through his window carrying dust and the talk of his city, and he would pretend not to listen to his own bones. In the courtyard, a boy finished washing the ladle because he had discovered that being the last to touch a thing made him important. In the north, under oaks, Eryn wrapped her scarf around her arm because she had no scarf about her throat and slept with one hand on the mare\u2019s rein and one on dirt that had decided to behave for the next four hours. In the first bowl the glass cooled by a thought. In the second bowl something that was not stone learned the geography of waiting.\n\nWhen the sun pulled itself up on Fresno\u2019s chosen hooks, the men with white armor were already lined at the rope, the lemon light on their plates making them look like pastries left to harden. The city woke with its usual shouting and began to add a new sound to it, not yet a word, certainly not a name, but a syllable of the sort that becomes both, a sound that could be described as mmhmm if you had no poetry and as agreement if you were in love. Sid drank the water Dolores forced on him and then he went under the fig-painted crenels to say the three sentences in the simple nouns he and his steward had chosen and the one he had made for himself: we will go see. He said them without speechifying, without lifting his chin more than a man lifts it to make his voice carry, without any word that would make a wrapper for his fear. People listened because they were tired from a night of hearing a thing that was older than them pretend to be born. Then the day ran, because days do, and the law of soup did its secret work, and knots held men and their appetites, and the bowls sung as bowls teach a place to stand, and somewhere in the pairs of hum and reply a word began to grow that would not be trolleyed into market or written into ledger until it was ready, and that would be the reason people would say later that this was the moment when Fresno learned to keep its mouth and its wonder both, and that was how you survive a season in which dragons are a rumor and a habit.",

                              "content": "Chapter Seven\n\nThe morning took hold with both hands, and Fresno, who had learned to rise whether begged or bellowed at, rose under a sky the color of old denim worked soft by years of washing. Sid stood under the crenels where the royal blue peeled away in the shapes he named, wind tugging the brim of the woven hat he wore instead of copper, and he spoke the three sentences he and Dolores had scraped down to bone. No fire near the bowls. No going past rope tied by a child of this city. No digging until a stone-listener says the word that is not yet yes. He added the one sentence that was his and would be, he hoped, the kind that clung: we will not name a thing until it tells us its name. He said we will go see after, not as a flourish but as habit, and the people below in the market, who knew the taste of habit, let it settle on their tongues and found it acceptable. Someone in the back laughed at a child\u2019s hat falling down over ears; someone else lifted a basket into shadow; a woman with her sleeves pushed to the elbow wiped her hands on an apron and nodded because this was not the worst set of orders she\u2019d heard paired with dawn.\n\nDolores had already split chalk and slate into a dozen small edicts and put them under the arms of boys who had been taught by mothers to run without testing the leashes of their lungs. She had taken Bee\u2019s words and Ajit\u2019s cautions and Tenorio\u2019s lore and made them walkable. There were three boards at the lower crossing and two at the upper, one nailed by Marta to a post that had outlived many signs and thought itself immortal. She had written the letters large and plain, and then she had made the children who carried them recite the rules until their mouths knew the shape better than a prayer. She sent the smallest boy with an old tin bell and told him where to ring it and where not to, and when he forgot, because small boys will, the rope Bee had tied kept his forgetting from becoming a tragedy. Between errands she required bread from a baker who had never been asked for anything without someone offering coins and who was surprised to find that being requisitioned by name and smile was a kind of currency he could accept.\n\nTomas laid out his cloth in the yard as if it were a map people might want to walk into. He had thread in colors acquired by methods no one wished to inspect, bones polished by fingers and river both, crackers wrapped in paper to bribe men into sitting awhile, and a bowl of buttons that had disagreed with their jackets. He told a boy with teeth like corn to string blue with black until his hands forgot to itch for stones to throw. He told a woman whose laugh had made winter bearable for three men to teach a half-dozen strangers how to braid a good rope, and when someone asked him what this had to do with dragons, he said, with sacred seriousness, that this had to do with the part of a day you spend not making enemies. He had a line of men pretending not to be waiting to sit by midmorning, each with a story they would not tell and a string they would.\n\nLord Baeza wrote his letter sitting on a spool of old cable that had pretensions to thronehood. He had a steady script, as if seas taught steadiness alongside sickness, and he told the Tidemark that the inland had grown a hum. He explained, in words that had the taste of his pride in them, that a girl\u2019s knot made a better border than salt if men agreed to feel it. He requested rope, not banners, and two men with ears worth their keep rather than a cavalcade. He did not mention that the soup had been good, but when the cleric with the blue stole leaned over to read and saw that omission, he tapped the line where the word might belong and Baeza sighed and added, by the way, their soup is not an offense to our name. Ajit brought him a cup of water and a piece of advice about inland rules wearing grudges, and Baeza surprised himself by saying thank you as if the road were a room he wished to be invited into again.\n\nTenorio found a child who would listen. She was eight and called Luz by a grandmother who had known the taste of light after the Breakage, and she had a way of standing that told a man she annexed information without paying full tax. He gave her a shallow pan filled with dirt from three places and a drum head stretched tight over a hoop that had once held a barrel of oil. He let a few grains fall on the drum and then hummed soft and she saw the grains walk, saw the pattern his voice made, saw that the pattern was different when he shifted his throat. He did not tell her she had learned a word. He told her she had learned how to spell an old word with new dust. Luz considered him solemnly and told him that if the earth was going to sing then the people should learn to harmonize instead of shouting. He nodded as if he had been waiting all morning for someone to say that so he could rest.\n\nUp at the second bowl Eryn stood with the gray mare\u2019s rein looped over a rock and Santi at her shoulder like an agreement he hadn\u2019t wanted and decided to honor anyway. She had two of hers in the scrub\u2014Lark with the quick hands and the sorrow he wore lightly, and Pina, whose smile was a tricky thing that had bought them time in three towns and nearly got them killed in a fourth. Eryn had wrapped the gray scarf around her bared head this time because the sun had decided to practice cruelty before noon, and she had wound the tail of it around her wrist in a knot that would let her pull it loose if someone tried to use it to make her obey. The hum here was thinner, a wire strung across a canyon as yet unnamed. It came up through her spine and made her teeth want to confess and then apologize for confessing. Santi stood as he had stood beside his wife\u2019s body the day he had learned widowhood as a word that didn\u2019t know him and made itself known anyway, with his hands quiet and obedient and his face giving nothing but a willingness to weather.\n\nThey walked the rim the way you walk the edge of a conversation you do not trust, looking for the places where language thins. The black straight piece in the bowl was not a root, not a pipe, not a blade as Eryn\u2019s knife-hand wished to call it for the satisfaction of knowing how to resist it. It did not take light. It accepted it. Eryn put her palm to a shard of glassed dirt and then took it away with a hiss, not of pain but of insult; the earth did not usually mind being touched by her and today it had decided it had preferences. Pina, who had been a weaver before the Breakage took her loom and traded it for two goats and a man\u2019s temper, crouched and studied the long edge of the black. She whispered that if you ran your eyes along it quick and then slower you could feel it sit in two times at once, which was a nonsense that nobody laughed at on the lip of a bowl.\n\nDown in the city a deputation from the Fig Guild came to the courthouse with fruit in hand and grievance in mouth. They brought a crate of the first bruised sweetness and offered it like a bribe to the idea of fairness. They complained that ropes were a fashion that would cost them dearly because knots meant delays and delays meant birds with audacity; they claimed that soup was all well and good until it took a bag of beans that could have been planted instead of boiled. Dolores listened as a woman listens when she has a child on her lap and a ledger in her head and a lock to her left and a jar of pickles that is not for today on the shelf above her. She assured them that soup could be made from ends and bones and not from their profits and that the ropes were there because men liked to run toward holes as if a hole would make them full. Ajit arrived with a bag of split peas in one hand and a cypress sprig in the other and told the fig men that if they sent boys to the bowls with ladders he would use those ladders to fix their broken culverts and in the evening he would sit on their porch and count with them how many gallons had been saved. They looked at Sid to see if he would be the kind of king who bowed to fruit, and he smiled at the figs because they had fed him as a boy and said, dignities will be met with dignities, and when you are right, Dolores tells me, and when you are wrong, she tells me louder.\n\nIn Market Lane a man named Esteban of Coppergate sold vials of soot as suckle-ash taken from the dragon\u2019s breath and promised it would make hens lay and wives forgive. Tomas bought one and opened it and smelled it and declared it to be stove. Ajit, who had spent the dawn freeing a jammed gate with his remaining fingers and a dictionary of curses he had acquired from seven cultures, pinched a bit of the ash between thumb and forefinger and smudged it on his wrist where the old burn lay and said without drama that dragon ash would not make a gaiter stain like that. He fined Esteban a morning\u2019s worth of hauling water to the soup pots and gave his soot vials to a boy who would make a fine ink with them if he was given the chance. Esteban argued until Tomas whispered to him a better business: little jars of market dust to keep in a pocket and remember belonging when a man had to walk away for a while. Esteban did not thank him, but later he left a jar with a cork tied by a ribbon near the cloth where Tomas sat, and Tomas took it and looked at it as if it were the neatest idea in ten days.\n\nBee ran the old canal like a girl who was learning the gravity of being trusted and enjoying every part of it. She tied ribbon at the turn where dirt learned to lie and at the crack in the gate post that looked like a man\u2019s face and at the fence line where the neighbor\u2019s wife had a habit of hanging laundry with pins made from apple wood. At the last she met a boy with calves like bent nails and a mouth that had not given up yet on being kind by accident. His name was Ivo, which sounded like an oath and a promise both. He was trying to slip the rope and prove something to his taller cousins, and Bee caught him not by the arm but by the word. She told him to help her tie instead and he did, and after an hour he had decided that ropes were better than daring because they let daring have a yard to romp in without getting cut by glass. He took the piece of ribbon she gave him as if it was a responsibility, which is a phenomenon you cannot sell in vials.\n\nAt the first bowl, not long after noon, a man too warmed by the common courage of soups and jokes tried to throw a stone because temptation is a muscle you must bruise early. The rope tugged his hips forward gently at first, like a mother pulling a child back from the curb, and then harder, because he insisted. It looked like a magician\u2019s trick; it was a knot that Bee had taught with a glare. Tenorio told a story from his chair, not loud and not long, about a hill that had eaten a wagon wheel because the wheel had been pointing in the wrong direction for a century and was tired. The man sat down and unlearned the itch in his arm without being scolded. The cleric built a moment of silence with his mmhmm and the young ones around him mimicked it because it felt like power without shouting and that was rare enough to be a novelty. For a little while the place was a classroom men had made for themselves without anyone in it owning chalk.\n\nAt the second bowl toward evening Eryn felt a new kind of breath come through the ground. It did not push. It asked. The birds did not fall out of it; they hesitated in it. The black straight thing in the center did not lift but it made its edges known to the dust and the dust, civilized by the lesson, arranged itself along lines Eryn could recognize by the face she made when she saw men put their knives in order instead of leaving them like bones thrown to dogs. She forbade Santi\u2019s hand without looking. He had been thinking of touching. His fingers stopped. Lark\u2019s mouth formed a word he did not speak because on some days the hum taught him his own name too loudly. Eryn let the wanting-to-know go through her and not out, which is what you have to do when you want to live long enough to find out anything of worth. She pulled the gray scarf twice tight around her wrist to remind herself she was still attached to this day and not some other.\n\nBy the time the message reached Sid it was a knot on a rope with an extra twist in it Bee had invented for urgency and trust. It had been tied by Pina and carried by Pico, a boy from the slope who could run a hill like a breath taken correctly. He did not come into the hall; he left the knot on the old gate by the plow wheel where Dolores had told him anything tied would be treated as a summons. Sid found it between a levy calculation and a kindness he had intended to pay and kept forgetting. He untied it and read it with his fingers the way men learn to read rope when letters feel like ceremonies for other people. Eryn was staying. The second bowl had shifted the way a sleeper shifts without waking. It wanted witness, not interruption. Pico had added a twist of his own that meant hunger, and Sid smiled because that was the part of this any king could fix.\n\nWhat he could not fix arrived with bells no one had asked for. They were not coastal bells. They were Dust Monks, who were not monks in any rigorous sense except that they preferred to love from a distance and then come closer with bowls. They wore robes washed thin by sand, carried mirrors framed in cracked wood, and sang a low chant that had learned a folk song on a long road and refused to leave it. They wanted to see the hum to decide if it was the kind of hum their founder had meant when he\u2019d said the earth would one day speak because it was tired of men saying it wrong. They wanted to hold their mirrors up to the bowl to see if humility could be reflected and they wanted to call it a lesson if it could not. Dolores met them at the rope with a ledger and a smile that had no blood in it, because her job on days when men thought themselves holy was to pour sand on their sparks until they thought themselves useful. She told them no mirrors inside the rope because mirrors make small suns and they weren\u2019t in the business of building new ones. The leader of the group, a woman called Sister Vero because she did not lie and made you wish you hadn\u2019t either, asked if she could sit close and say nothing. Tenorio permitted it as he would permit a neighbor\u2019s gourd in his garden if the neighbor promised to pick it when it was ripe.\n\nBy late afternoon a rumor of a man Eryn did not love more than policy arrived at the second bowl. He rode a bay with a tail that had been cut for practicality and spite and wore three rings in his left ear that had never healed properly and so bled when he was angry. His name was Gavino and he was the sort of thief who thought waiting his turn made him weak. He had been a friend to nothing that could not be folded into his pocket and passed off as being a poem. He smiled at Eryn with the teeth of a little fish that has survived by never attempting to be bigger. He informed her that he and his would be lowering pigs into the hole morning after next, to prove it was a saint\u2019s mouth and therefore their parish\u2019s business. Eryn did not take her knife out because she had decided this hour to not give a man the dignity of a threat. She offered him soup which he refused because the spoon was in her hand and not his. She advised him in front of Santi\u2019s patient eyes that lowering pigs is a quick way to learn the phrase no one comes to your funeral. He told her to come see him when she had grown out of courtesy and rode away with his ear bleeding from the pressure of his temper on his rings.\n\nSid called a hearing under the north oak at twilight when heat had loosened its grip enough to be ashamed of itself. He did not sit on the plow throne; he stood with one hand on the oldest scar in the bark and the other on Rosales\u2019s knife because that combination of the old and the sharp made him feel constructed correctly. Representatives came because names give men reasons to say they deserve to, and they said them. Fig Guild. Sheep. Salt. Dust. Stone-listeners. The women who keep graves. The three old men who sang on Wednesdays and had come to accept that no verdict was complete without them harmonizing at the end. He made a new oath that would be called a small thing later when people who had not been there wanted to feel larger. He said that any rope tied by a child of Fresno was law where law might otherwise not exist, and that to untie it without permission would cost a week of carrying water and a day of sweeping the courtyard and a night of singing until your throat remembered you had a body. He made soup an instrument, not of order, but of intention, and that is what instruments are, and he wrote it down with the cheap ink Ajit swore by so the words bled into the page and would not look neat when the page got wet. He asked Tenorio and Marta to make of their listening a guild and offer apprenticeships paid in bread and glory, and both said they preferred glory to come later. He affirmed the coastal men a place at the rope and took from them the right to speak to market about anything but what soups they had tasted. He did not say Eryn\u2019s name and everyone he loved knew it and did not make him pay for it publicly.\n\nAt dawn the next day he learned what tremors meant when they did not end where you could see them. The gate at Walnut Skew shuddered and Ajit caught the chain with what fingers he had and dragged it into obedience while swearing he would have a fourth and fifth son to name after this day and he was not in the business of sons. The bowls answered each other like voices across a house, not singing yet but trying out sound as a method of affection or warning. The hum rolled under the city and shook a cupboard in a woman\u2019s kitchen so that her cups clinked and she decided to forgive her neighbor a debt simply because she liked the singing of it. Tenorio stood in the yard and turned slow and pointed his chin east and said it was rolling that way, which meant the next moment would have a choice to make. Lord Baeza, who had sailed through weather that tore sails like confessions, said under his breath that this was a tide inside the land, which made Ajit look at him and smile like a man recognizing a craft when he had only seen wood before.\n\nEryn spent the hour before noon with the kind of attention that wrings sweat out of a person who is only standing still. The second bowl had begun to change. You could not watch it do it. You had to turn away and then check and then know it had moved and feel both relieved and angry, which is how a city grows and a woman makes a decision she knows will cost her. The black edge lifted up the thickness of a thumb and sank back as if reconsidering. A swipe of wind came from the center without bringing the smell of heat, and the grass along the rim leaned north as if being taught a lesson by a stern aunt. Santi placed a stick at the edge and marked it with his knife and when it moved, he marked again and sang a song under his breath to make the marks into a story and not a panic. Eryn crouched like a prayer and put her palm near, not on, and the air on her skin felt like metal might if metal were ashamed of itself for loving softness. She took a stone the size of an apricot, wrote her name on it with the ink Esteban had started making for the market, and put it in her pocket because sometimes the only way to be a seamstress in a life that keeps handing you knives is to plan to stitch something later with symbols foolish enough to believe in you.\n\nThe Dust Monks almost undid an afternoon just by being themselves. They held up their mirrors not toward the bowl but toward the faces staring at it, and people started seeing themselves and that is often a spark you cannot count on to behave. A child squealed because her hair stood on end without anyone\u2019s permission, and three boys laughed and then made their own hair stand as a way of courting the hum into thinking they were grown. Sister Vero found Tomas and told him in the tone of a woman confident you will hear her that their founder had said the day would come when the earth would ask us to speak quieter. Tomas pointed toward the soup kettles and told her the same thing in Fresno, and she lifted her mirrored bowl gently and went to sit by the rope and did not make ceremony of it. The hum in that hour ran along the edge of the cities people had within themselves, and a few of those edges softened and retained the softness and a few cut deeper to prove that steel was still a possibility here among goats and figs.\n\nThere were negotiations with God, because there always are. The cleric with the blue stole told his god who loves a horizon that he had found one in a bowl and he was trying to pretend that wasn\u2019t possible but his chest felt better when he leaned into the pretense. He offered the hum his mmhmm, which is a prayer you can take anywhere without breaking it, and it came back to him as a change in pitch that made him feel like a child hearing an adult sing badly and trying to match it. In the night he dreamed of water sitting in a stone cup without becoming less itself and woke to write that down shamefaced because it looked, in moonlight, like an attempt at a poem. He did not show it to Tomas. Tomas would have either praised it and ruined it or mocked it and made it better.\n\nUnder the north oak Sid and Dolores drafted, by lantern and biting flies, the Rope Oath in a copy that would be hung at the courthouse and in two copies that would be tucked inside cookie tins because Dolores trusted tins with the kind of loyalty she did not extend to stapled parchments. The oath said that you owed your city one hour of sitting still at a rope for every rumor you spread, and men laughed but they sat when asked because cords need weight to show they can hold. It said that soup could settle three disputes a day and no more, because soup runs out and so should argument, and for the overflow there were pebbles and a circle and a game taught by a fool who would let you cheat as long as you did it with style. It said the bowls would be considered graves when the women who kept graves said so, and until then they were considered markets where no one could sell anything but patience.\n\nEryn and Santi set their watch in thirds as if this were winter and the thing they were guarding against was hunger instead of curiosity. Around the second bowl they put little bells that Pina made from bottle necks and twine, low, at shin height, so that a man with intent would sing his malicious tidings before he got where he meant to go. In the dark a coyote sang that figure eight again, long ears weaving the air, and Pina said without irony that perhaps the coyotes were the form the hum would take when it decided to walk. Santi told her not to give the world ideas. Eryn slept four times for ten minutes and woke four times feeling guilty for the seconds she had abandoned the city. Guilt is a thread, and she rolled it around her wrist and made it into a bracelet rather than a noose because she had learned to dress herself on mornings she had not chosen.\n\nNear midnight the first bowl answered the second with a sound like a cart being pushed over worn wood and everyone who had ever pushed a cart that rattled in quite that way felt the insult and the compliment of recognition. The hum moved through the sleeping like a cat deciding which lap is best and some people dreamed of teeth and some dreamed of smooth edges and some did not dream at all because not dreaming is sometimes how a person keeps a day from taking all of them. Sid woke twice and did not go to the window, which made him feel like a man who had learned the smallest part of a thing he had promised to learn. He went instead to his table and his pencil broke and he laughed under his breath because Ajit had called it and because even if he had not he would have felt the world telling him, not everything needs a word tonight.\n\nAt dawn, when the sky wore a pale ridge of light that would turn to gold if you were lucky and to glare if you were not, Eryn stood with her hand on the gray mare\u2019s flank and her eyes on the black and she felt it decide something without telling her what that something was. The straight lifted again the width of a fingernail and set back down and when it did a breath came up that smelled like fennel that had been burned in a kitchen where someone had argued and then wept. She had planned three moves ahead of such a thing and none quite matched what she had been given, which is how you know you are alive and not a script. She whistled not the mare\u2019s call but a note she had made for emergencies and raised her hand not to shade her eyes but to hail a messenger only she could see. In the city a boy untied a ribbon from a post and began to run. Sid, who had been about to say his four sentences again at the courthouse because the second day is when men forget, put his hand on the words and held them still. He felt the pull that had nothing to do with lust and everything to do with obligation and desire having discovered they could share a chair for the space of an hour.\n\nThe day stretched itself thin and did not tear only because so many hands held it up. The law of soup did its secret arithmetic, subtracting two fights for every ladle. The rope held foolishness by the waist and made it laugh and sit down. The salt men learned, to their surprise, to look without planning where to put a foundation, and Lord Baeza wrote a second letter that used the word listen twice and his own men did not rib him for it because they, too, had felt the quiet without the sense of loss that came with quiet at sea. Tenorio taught Luz to hear the difference between a warning and a pronouncement and Luz went home and taught her mother and her mother taught the neighbor and soon there were twenty more ears in the city that were tools and not ornaments. Ajit promised a gate to a woman who had never been promised anything and then made it, and when it broke he fixed it without telling anyone and he felt afterward that he had done something both religious and rude.\n\nNear sunset, when men made themselves bigger with shadows, Gavino\u2019s watchers showed themselves at the second bowl in the least imaginative way. They found their harnesses snagged by Pina\u2019s bells and every step turned them into goats announced by tin. Eryn, who had perfected the art of making scorn into medicine, offered them bread and water and asked the name of their mothers and learned it and used it in a sentence in a tone you cannot buy and cannot fake. They untangled themselves from their humiliation and decided to wait until night to be foolish. Santi saw one look toward the black as if wishing to throw a crowbar at it and he walked into that look and stood there until the man\u2019s glance went dull. Three times a woman from Piedra came up the road to stare and cry and stare and not cry and Eryn stood beside her and looked with her and did not ask because asking is sometimes just laziness dressed as care.\n\nIn the yard under the fig-painted crenels, Sid sat with his people and ate soup and bread and listened to men tell each other what they had almost done and how they had saved themselves from it. He told Tomas to claim a corner of the courthouse for a guild of hands that kept people from setting fire to their own hair, and Tomas said he would hang a bell and if you rang it he would give you thread and a song, and if you rang it twice he would make you sit until your fury remembered it once had been love. Dolores washed her chalk-stained fingers and said quietly that they would need more tins for their laws because paper didn\u2019t hold under the weight of days like this. Rosales came by with the knife\u2019s twin and told Sid her grandmother had been humming all afternoon and when Sid said he knew, she meant the old woman had been alive in her, and he smiled because he had not known but now he did and that is a kind of miracle you can claim without owing anyone coins.\n\nHe went to sleep with the hum under him like a river were the bed it had always claimed to be and he let the desire to go north and stand beside the woman who had made a rule of staying where he could not see her be what it was. He did not tell himself stories meant to make his wanting noble. He put the want on the sill where the moon could see it and judge him and he lay down without reaching for it and that felt like using the better tool in a box he finally admitted he owned. Eryn, under oaks, threaded a bit of string through the hole in a button because her hands needed to practice what they insisted they were meant for, and she made a small ragged bracelet and tied it around Santi\u2019s wrist like a joke and not, and he accepted it with the gravest face to save them both from embarrassment. The hum rose once more like a thing learning to speak polite and swallowed its own name, and for a moment, in two places that had never been the same place and never would be, a king and a thief kept their mouths and their wonder both, and that was the only right way to end a day like this before beginning the next.",

Fresno\u2019s sun climbed up with a stiffness it had not confessed to in years, and the sky was the pale of a healed bruise. Sid stood under the fig-painted crenels with the woven hat tugged low and the taste of old copper in his mouth as if he had bit a coin in his sleep. He said the four sentences because discipline is the only muscled prayer he believed in, and the market heard them without surprise and with relief. People do not mind being reminded of the same small kindnesses if the day ahead threatens large unkindnesses. Dolores sent the bell boy with the tin and sent two girls with chalk and sent a man with a voice that reached four streets to sit by Tomas and learn to speak at a volume that took the place of shouting. Sid watched the faces lift and lower and settle around his words and he thought bitterly and fondly of soup. He thought if he ever managed another decade in this city he would have to build a statue to a pot.\n\nBy the second hour the north wind did a new thing; it arrived and then stopped and then remembered itself and came again without malice. Tenorio turned toward the hills and cupped his good ear as if catching the day like a fly. \u201cIt\u2019s rolling like a barrel you shouldn\u2019t have let your cousin seal,\u201d he said, and the sheep men laughed without threat because that was exactly the feeling and because metaphors could be tools when the right calluses wielded them. Ajit had been counting while other men listened. He had his chalk on the cobbles and his gate schedules in his head and the taste of grit at the back of his throat where paper turns to reluctance. \u201cIt will take the pressure at Walnut Skew and at La Palma both,\u201d he told no one and Dolores at once. \u201cIf the hum runs under at the same rate as the flow, we can teach the gates to breathe, and if it doesn\u2019t, we can teach men how not to panic while they pretend they did.\u201d\n\nDolores sent a boy for Rosales and sent a woman to bring Ajit the flat bread he forgot and sent a note to the women who kept the graves written in the polite hand she used for saints. She knew the city as a box of moving pieces that would disobey if you bullied and would work miracles if you asked with the tone their grandmothers used on them when they were eight. She drafted, in between three orders and two jokes, the beginnings of an ordinance she told no one she was writing: the Breath Law, which would tell men that some days were for opening without fear and some days were for shutting without bravado, and which would be useless until someone made a ritual of it.\n\nAt the second bowl a man made of excuses and cheap metal arrived with dawn still arguing in his hair. Gavino brought two pigs in a cart with slats and the sort of ropes that fray their own ends in impatience. He had three men and the certainty that doing the wrong thing quickly would count as faith if you held your chin high. Pina\u2019s little bells told on them three steps before they showed their faces and Santi had his hand on the cart before any boast found breath. Eryn took her scarf off her head for the first time that day so the wind could see that she had come bare and not to threaten, and she smiled a smile that men have left rooms to avoid and then stayed awake thinking about. \u201cYou lower anything into this,\u201d she told Gavino, \u201cand it will not be pigs that come back out changed. It will be your name. It will be the way your mother is greeted at the well.\u201d\n\nGavino looked at Santi because men like him always look to find the crack in another man\u2019s patience. Santi\u2019s face said it had outlived winter, a fever, the kind of hunger that makes a man want to lie to himself, and a woman he had loved for a long time dying anyway. It said today was not the day a boy with too much jewelry made it worse. \u201cHear our bells,\u201d Santi said, and his voice was so even it might have been a level held against a wall. \u201cWe will untie them for you and let you go back down the road with your pigs alive if you leave before the wind changes. If you push, we will push. We are past the hour where I will be made ashamed of the care I take for things I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nPina flipped her knife end over end and caught it by the safe part and then showed Gavino the thing she had made from bottle necks and twine. \u201cMine rings louder than your name,\u201d she said, and there was no pride in it because it wasn\u2019t pride, it was fact. The pigs snorted because pigs have the good sense to be afraid of bowls that hum. Gavino held his jaw where the rings bit and let his pride do the arithmetic. Eryn waited him out because patience had won her more arguments than knives ever had, and when he snarled something about coming back and making parish business of this, she did not look at the men he would rouse. She looked at the women who would be made to sweep after him. She said quietly, \u201cYou bring a priest with a bowl and we will let him sit and mmhmm, and if he blesses your rope I will cut it and feed it to your pig and call it a consecration.\u201d He left because there is a kind of dignity in retreat when done before witnesses and because Santi did not take his hand off the cart.\n\nAt the first bowl they discovered that law was better obeyed when it was sung. Tomas took Dolores\u2019s slate and wrote the rope oath as if it were verse and then made the three old men sing it without harmony and without shame. Men laughed and then found themselves mouthing it, and when a stranger came with a hand reaching past Bee\u2019s knots, three people in three different languages said the same sentence with the same ends and the man\u2019s hand learned shyness. Sister Vero folded her mirror up in a square of cloth and sat without proselytizing because the hum that morning made its own sermon and she was tired of competing with elements. She said two lines of her founder\u2019s saying and then substituted a third she invented that moment: that the holiness we fear might be nothing but attention.\n\nLord Baeza\u2019s men arrived near the hour that made flies bold. They did not carry a bell tower; they brought coils of rope that had the good smell of tar and winter hands. They brought two men whose ears sat on their heads like tools rather than ornament, and when Tenorio looked at them he did the old man\u2019s version of nodding approval\u2014he spat with precision and did not smile. The two stone-listeners sat with Luz and her drumskin and treated the child as an apprentice rather than an audience, which made half the men nearby take them seriously. Baeza himself had learned to stand back from the rope without looking forced, and when a saltman new to inlanders stepped too close, Baeza caught his shoulder and squeezed in a manner that carried a map of limits. \u201cWe\u2019re guests,\u201d he said, and he did not like the words but he practiced them.\n\nAjit made the gates breathe. It was not as pretty as priests would have wanted. He ran, which is undignified in a man over forty who has carried chains with his teeth. He shouted when shouting would save a minute. He handed a boy his shirt to carry because it would slow him and he did not like the feeling of skin announcing itself but you do what you have to do when the river makes new ribs. He took Walnut Skew\u2019s chain with his three fingers and the rope of his forearm and the anger he had at iron that thought itself superior, and he timed the drop to the hum. It felt wrong and then it felt right and then it felt like nothing and then he realized his teeth had stopped hurting. He sent a runner to La Palma with a sequence written as if it were a poem a drunk could keep in his mouth and told him to recite it at every culvert. He did not know whether he was worshiping, but it had the same posture.\n\nThe women who kept the graves came in their working dresses and the shoes they were not afraid to get wet. They stood at the rope and said nothing for a long while and then asked for a bench because sisters do not stand when they can sit and still be more imposing than any man in armor. Dolores fetched a bench and then another and then a third and she did not gossip near them. They argued in the dignity of low voices about what a grave was and whether a place where no one had been laid down yet could be one. At last the eldest, whose hair had been white since a morning forty years ago and who had a habit of mispronouncing the names of men who lied to her, tapped the rope as if asking permission to enter a thought. \u201cWe will not call this a grave,\u201d she said, and two other women nodded because she had not got ahead of herself. \u201cWe will call it a mourning ring. People will bring what grief they cannot pour anywhere else and leave it here, and that will keep them from pouring it on their children. We will sit where the ring begins and we will sit where it ends and when it becomes a grave we will tell you and you will believe us.\u201d\n\nWhen the hum rose midday, the lattice returned in the dust and stayed a breath longer. Luz put her fingertips on her drum and hummed a note that matched and the grains arranged themselves into a different geometry, like ribs in a chest made of judgement. Tenorio\u2019s eyelids fluttered in that ridiculous way that makes you think of birds. \u201cIt\u2019s counting,\u201d he said, and it was not a useful sentence until he said, \u201cit counts to three and then insists on two and then rests, which means the next place will try to be new and then remember it has a twin and then we will have to hold our mouths and not say what comes after twin.\u201d\n\nBee, who had been told all morning to drink water and had obeyed because she remembered what it was to not have it to obey with, leaned over the drum and hummed a harmony. The grains shivered and made a pattern like a net laid wrong. Ajit held his schedule in his head and said, with the same voice he said gate, \u201cAt the third note we release at North Sluice for two minutes and catch at Dredge Street for seven. We will do this three times. We will pretend to be clever and later we will write down what we did and call it an instruction for men who don\u2019t like being told that bodies can be instruments.\u201d\n\nThey did it. The canal let out and took in in a way that made the water remember being a hand. The hum slid under the city and did not catch in places where it could have. A cup in a woman\u2019s house chimed against another and then stopped. A man who had tied a bucket to a rope asked his daughter to sing while he pulled and she did and the note made him cry, which embarrassed him and then did not. Sid watched Ajit\u2019s throat move with the work and thought that if he lived to be old he would train boys up to bring the man he loved more than he knew to water and give him easy days. He thought this in the middle of a crisis and that is how you know he was in it for the long shape, not the short noise.\n\nBy late afternoon, when the light tried to make men handsome and failed at all but a few, Sister Vero stood and asked in her mild assaulting way to speak. The rope had taught her gentleness without making her feel diminished and she found she liked that trick. She told the gathering that her founder had said the earth would speak when tired, yes, but also that the conversation most worth having would be the one you made in your mouth when you told yourself the story of what you were seeing. \u201cIf we say dragon and we mean fear,\u201d she said, \u201cwe will be given fear. If we say dragon and we mean wonder, we will be given wonder. If we say breath and mean law, we may be given enough time to make one.\u201d It was not eloquent. It was not even new. It made three men who were about to do a stupid thing sit on their hands and unlearn the urge for thirty breaths and that bought someone else time to build a fence of questions.\n\nOn the north road a cart came with parts of a bell tower wrapped in canvas because men never believe you when you tell them you do not need a bell. Lord Baeza intercepted them with the easy impatience of a captain who has brought his ship into a dock that pretends to be a wall. He told them there were bells enough in men\u2019s throats and that hanging a weight from a roof over a hole would make the hole a person and they were not electors of that person. The men argued and then were outnumbered and then decided to be merchants and sell the canvas as shade for the soup pot, which turned them from opposition into assets and Tomas congratulated them on their conversion. He set their pole aside and tied a string of bones to it and called it a shrine to patience and they threw him a curse and then a coin and then a grin.\n\nAt the second bowl the wind went east and brought the smell of something that had never been alive. Eryn had expected it and hated that about herself. The black straight piece lifted three fingernails thick and settled back with a grace that made all the hairs on her arm salutes of their own. Pina hissed the word that meant stop without making a sound and the boys in the scrub froze like deer who had learned to be predators for a moment. Santi marked another line in the dirt and head-counted without moving his chin because he took census seriously only when bodies were at stake. Eryn felt, in that instant, the peculiar sistole of a day that refuses to be linear. She wanted to be everywhere\u2014the first bowl to see if the lattice changed its mind, the second to see if the edge would confess, the lower farms to catch the man now pouring too much water, the fig orchard because it had been where she had made a mistake and mistakes call you like home. She stayed. She held her breath. She did not give the bowl any names in her head. The hum accepted the lack with gratitude the way a child accepts not being told their own story wrong.\n\nSid arranged what he could call a council only because people needed it called something. The women with the graves bench sat at his left and the salt men leaned on their elbows at his right and Tenorio had placed himself where he would be seen without being adored. Ajit, with a rag around his neck that had been dipped in river to stop him from boiling, stood behind Sid like a wall you only build in your first season as king and then never again because you learn to trust the building to be where you left it. They made the Breath Law into paper and then into the tin. Dolores enlisted the boy with calves like bent nails to carry the tin to the fig orchard where another could be placed by the plow throne so that the law would be in two places at once and therefore believed. Tomas ringed the tin with thread in a color he announced as unnameable and when someone said it was just green, he said that was the point, that names hide as often as they reveal.\n\nBy the third day\u2019s dusk, the city had grown quiet in a new way. It was not sulking. It was not waiting to explode. It was the quiet of a kitchen that has fed too many and then washed the last ladle. Bee had taught three boys how to tie the knot that turns a rope from a suggestion to a refusal, and she had taught a girl how to tell a man to sit without making him feel like a donkey and the girl had tried it on Tomas and Tomas had sat and it had been a good performance all around. Lord Baeza had sent his second letter and received, impossibly quick, an answer tied to a messenger\u2019s belt in seal skin that smelled like apologies. It said rope more than once. It said there would be money and there would not be priests unless the inland asked. It was a letter meant to be seen by a king and by a woman with chalk and by the market that liked to make a day into a story.\n\nThat was when the clean fire came down the ridge. It did not look like fire. It looked like a shimmer over dry grass. It made a coyote\u2019s outline into a lesson and then let the coyote yelp and run and leave behind a smell like burnt fennel and embarrassment. The wave carried no light of its own and it touched the rim of the first bowl and the rim hissed and then calmed, and every mouth in the yard made the little oh that people make in churches and bedrooms and over broken things. Tenorio held out his hand. His rings, which he wore not for decoration but because his fingers thought better when they remembered the weight of metal, sang in his bones. He swore once, honestly, and pulled them off and put them in Dolores\u2019s palm because women who keep books and soup can keep other valuables in a way men will not consider theft. \u201cNo metal at the rope,\u201d he said, and the sentence cut three foolishnesses in half where they stood.\n\nThe cleric put his whalebone ring in his pocket and glowed slightly from the relief of being told what to do that made immediate sense. Lord Baeza took the plates off his men with motions that suggested intimacy between commander and commanded and set them aside gently as if the straps were tendons and would remember cruelty. Ajit looked down at his chain and did not flinch at the way his missing fingers felt like doctrine. He said to the boys at the gates, \u201cLeather wraps today. You hold with cloth. Your mother\u2019s aprons will save you and you will return them washed.\u201d\n\nEryn saw the shimmer at the second bowl lift a grass\u2019s width of dust and settle and she taught her breath to obey manners. She sent Pico down with a knot to tell Sid what she could not dictate. She put her body between the black edge and the place where a boy would be stupid because she had been that boy at other times of her life and a body in the way always helps. Santi took his bracelet\u2014the ragged string Eryn had made there in the dark\u2014and tied it around the new stake he had set to mark the change so that anyone who did not think much of men would be told by thread what needed not doing. Pina snapped at Lark because he had reached for a rock with the old, terrible itch in his fingers, and he held his hand back and made a small noise because he had almost understood himself. They did not call it miracle and they did not call it curse. They called it noon-at-dusk and this is how language earns its bread.\n\nWhen night put its full weight on the ridge, Sid walked as far as he could before duty made a leash of his ankle and he stopped under a tree that had been there before he had words. The air was a kind of friend who had not seen him for three days and intended to remind him he was mortal. He thought, because he was trying to live, of ordinary things: of the sound the stoneware made when Dolores put it on the board a little too hard at the end of a day; of the way Ajit sighed when a gate obeyed; of the face Santi had made at soup as if he were trying to decide between gratitude and grief; of Bee tying a knot as if she could tie time; of Tenorio setting his rings aside with the face of a priest turning from the altar to the basin; of Lord Baeza eating bread and pretending to disapprove of it and then asking for another piece; of Sister Vero watching her mirror reflect nothing and deciding that was the point; of Eryn\u2019s hand on her own wrist holding her scarf on not as fashion but as restraint. He did not go to the window when he lay down. He put his hand out on the bed where something might lie and he did not lie to himself about who he wanted to be there or what that would cost.\n\nOn the fourth morning a deputation from the women of Lower Woodlake arrived with a question and an answer folded into it. They asked whether the mourning ring could also be a place to lay down promises and they answered themselves by laying down three: that no child of theirs would go to the rope without a mother\u2019s word; that no man would set a fire in anger inside the smell of soup; that when the bowls named themselves they would listen and say the names right even if those names were hard. Sid wrote them into the tin because some words need to rattle to feel real. Dolores wrote them onto a slate because slates do not get rebuked by rain. Tomas wrote them on a piece of ribbon and gave it to a boy and told him to tie it to anything that would not be improved by a knot, and the boy tied it to his own wrist and declared himself a draft horse and was not entirely wrong.\n\nThe third place announced itself before noon by not being a place. It was a line two fields long where the earth sighed and dropped the thickness of a man\u2019s hand, and the grass laid itself flat as if measuring fabric. Ajit felt it in the backs of his knees. Tenorio heard it in his good ear like someone dragging a chair on a floor in the next room, the old complaint of wood. The hum in the bowls did not rise to meet it; it let the line be. There was relief in that. There was also the knowledge that whatever was beneath them did not intend to be mapped on anyone\u2019s schedule but its own. Dolores sent two boys with chalk and told them to mark both ends and then sit on the chalk to make it a place, because place is a thing you decide as much as a thing that happens.\n\nEryn walked the new line and looked at the way the cracks refused to be dramatic. She had tended to love only the dramatic because it had been a way of insisting she was alive when the quiet tried to convince her otherwise. Now she made friends with modest rupture. She knelt and pressed her fingers to the least interesting seam and felt there the whisper a bow makes before a string is drawn. She wanted to shout. She wanted to sing. She did not do either because the Dust Monks had taught her something against her will and Bee\u2019s knots had taught her the same thing willingly. She stood and shaded her eyes and saw from the ridge the dust rise from the first bowl as if a man had thrown a blanket in anger and then shook it until he remembered blankets are for warmth. She thought, because she had not been gifted with patience the way some had been but had learned to steal it, that perhaps the bowls and the line wanted to be looms. She did not test the word aloud. She put it in her mouth like a seed.\n\nGavino came back at dusk with company who took up space by claiming not to. Eryn put her palms on her knees and asked them what their mothers would think if the last thing their sons did was argue with a woman about pigs on a day that had made patience an art. They bristled less at being made ridiculous than at being made ordinary. Tomas wandered up the path with a thread on his wrist and a bone in his pocket and told a long, wearying story about a man who lowered a pig into a well to see if it would come out clean and how the pig had fallen in love with the dark and refused to come back and how the man had been forced to climb down and live there and how the town had had to either bless the well or fill it and they had done neither because they\u2019d become the sort of people who could not make a choice. It was a pointless story that was either about them or not and that annoyed them enough that they left just to spite it. Santi squeezed Tomas on the back of the neck in thanks and Tomas shrugged like a man who knows exactly what he has done.\n\nNight broke open without theater. Under the fig-painted crenels, Sid read the day back to himself the way a man reads a recipe to see where he had lied. He and Dolores turned the tin in their hands and both thought of their mothers without saying the word, because tin remembers better than paper and both their mothers had been made to make do with it. He thought of the boy Pico asleep under a cart with one shoe half on, of Luz listening to flies decide where to land, of Lord Baeza dreaming of a wave with edges, of Sister Vero turning her mirror to face the wall, of Tenorio without his rings feeling and not liking his lightness, of Ajit with his rag around his neck snoring like a man who has earned every rasp. He thought of Eryn at the second bowl with the gray scarf tied not at her throat but round her arm and the mare\u2019s breath close by and the black edge within reach if she allowed it and the thread in her pocket with her name on the stone.\n\nHe slept and did not dream in a way that felt like trust rather than exhaustion. The bowls hummed and then did not. The line sighed again, and two raccoons paused at the edge of it, offended, and then found another path because animals are atheists and it serves them. In the morning, when the sky decided to be a mint version of blue, Fresno woke still being Fresno instead of something else, and that counted as a victory that could not be marked on any ledger. Sid went to the rope before he went to the courthouse because he had made a law and it would be good to obey it in a visible way. He put one hand on Bee\u2019s knot and one hand on the rope that Baeza\u2019s men had tarred and he put his mouth close to the air over the bowl and he did not speak into it. He let it be. The hum came as if pleased.\n\nHe turned and saw Eryn below at the bend in the lower road where hawkweed grows without permission. She did not come up. She did not lift a hand. The gray scarf was around her wrist and looked, for a moment, like a ribbon Bee might have tied as a joke on the world. He went down the path until the rope asked him with its rub to stop and he did. She stood inside the little gate Marta had made like a removed piece of fence and looked, not at him, but at the slope. \u201cI have a new word I am not ready to believe,\u201d she said without greeting, because there are days you can only save your life by being unromantic. \u201cI will say it when I can say it without thinking of men building churches out of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will sit here,\u201d Sid said, and did, in dust that had learned to be domestic. \u201cI will tell no one your word. I will do the things I am good at doing that keep boys\u2019 hands from empty places. I will make soup laws and breath laws and rope oaths and I will write your not-word into the part of me that makes decisions and I will obey it without speaking it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo that,\u201d she said. \u201cDo your little magic and I will do mine. The world likes little magics better than big ones because little magics happen while the world is looking the other way.\u201d She almost smiled, and then the almost did the work of a whole smile simply because it had to. \u201cWhen you make a bed for men to go to when they would otherwise light a fire, make it far enough from the rope that the hum has to work to reach them. Give them something to do with their hands that is not their knives. Give them the bones of goats and string and tell them to make saints out of them. They\u2019ll laugh at you and then they\u2019ll start and then they\u2019ll keep going because they have found a thing that won\u2019t make their friends bleed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you come into the city,\u201d he asked, and it was a stupid question and it was the right one because he wanted to know if his city deserved her. He wanted to know if his people could sit at a table and not try to make her name theirs.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a boy from Piedra who thinks he can teach the hum his song. I need to sit with him and tell him he is right and then show him which part of right is safe. Also there is a man who will come with a cart and try to sell the black in the second bowl by the ounce as if it were medicine. I mean to remove his wheels. It will profit him to learn to carry what he sells.\u201d\n\nWhen he stood to go, because the rope was a beast and had pulled enough on both of them to make retreat the honorable act, he said the only one of his private sentences he would dare aloud. \u201cWhen the word comes,\u201d he told her, and his mouth made it gentle, \u201cI will say it wrong first. That is my habit. Correct me.\u201d\n\nShe nodded, and for a moment he saw her as a seamstress and not as a cutter of threads, as a woman who could stand at a loom and call men to bring her what they had and make from it a pattern no one had believed could be worn. Then she turned her face back to the slope and the hum, and he went up to the rope and down to the city and into the day that had already decided to be difficult without having the dignity of being dramatic.\n\nBy noon the city had learned three new ways to keep from breaking. Ajit hung buckets of water at corners that had never seen kindness and told whoever walked by that it was theirs. Sister Vero set her mirror where it would catch only the hands and not the bowl, and men came to see their hands and to discover that they did not mind them as much as they had the day before. Luz taught two women how to make the dust move on the drumskin and those women taught four and one of them named the pattern she made for a horse that had died and somehow the naming made the pattern less sad. Lord Baeza took his armor apart the rest of the way and sat in his shirt in the heat and let a child tie a ribbon around his wrist and did not remove it. Tenorio took his rings back when the shimmer failed to rise at the expected hour and put them on one by one like promises and sighed as if vows could be a relief.\n\nIn the evening the rope held a man in place who would have run to the bowl to shout a secret; he held him like a friend might hold a shirt. The man cried not because the rope denied him but because he realized he had not been listening for most of his life and that the feeling under his ribs was not one he could sell. He sat and Tomas sat with him and told him a story about a fish who had learned to climb and then had learned that the best thing about climbing was descending without shame. The story had no moral and therefore it could be kept.\n\nOn the fifth morning, which no one had pinned hopes on and therefore it permitted a little grace, the black edge in the second bowl lifted two fingers\u2019 thickness and held without thinking better of itself. Eryn did not say her word. Sid did not go north. Ajit taught a boy to pull a chain with the right muscle. Dolores tied a knot as if the past were a thing you could make a belt from that did not rub. Lord Baeza watched a man who had decided to be better without saying it and thought, privately, that the horizon might exist even inland. Tenorio put Luz\u2019s drumskin to his ear and hummed a note that made the dust lay in an old pattern he remembered from a quarry that had become a lake, and he cried because a man is allowed and then went on with his day. Sister Vero sat with her mirror in her lap and did not try to explain anyone to anyone.\n\nGavino did not come with his pigs. He sent a boy whose ear did not yet bleed. The boy left a note tied in bad twine to Marta\u2019s brush gate that said an apology without the word and carried in it the ignorance of how to begin. Marta tucked the note into the tin and told Dolores there were worse beginnings. Sid wrote on the slate the breath schedule for the day and Ajit wrote beneath it a rude aside that made two men grin and do the work and that saved three minutes and three minutes add up over a season. Bee tied a ribbon no one saw to a place where only a woman who had loved someone slippery would look, and later that afternoon Eryn found it and laughed out loud like a girl.\n\nWhen the sun laid down flat on the ridge and the bowls sang each to each in the shy talk of instruments who were just learning, the city hummed back. It was not a hymn. It was not a pledge. It was not even music as much as a refusal to be silent where silence would be taken as consent. The mourning ring received three promises and one regret. The rope held. The soup learned a new ratio of onion to salt. Men took off their rings before they got to the rope without being told. The tin held the paper through a brief wind that wanted to make men watch it rather than work and failed. And in the night, in the place where he had learned to put his want where the moon could judge it without shaming him, Sid slept with his hand open and Eryn slept with her hand in the dirt and the hum did not press harder than either could bear. It was not victory. It was what you need to keep going long enough to make victory a word you can say without the taste of blood.",
