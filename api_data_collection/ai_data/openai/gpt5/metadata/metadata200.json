     "novel_text": "The gulls in Portsmouth never shut up. They trawl the sky with beaks open and eyes like buttons, voices full of tin, loud enough to drown the ferry horns and the traffic and the banging from the shipyard that begins somewhere before dawn and doesn\u2019t end even when the sky is ink. I grew up thinking noise was a kind of weather. It presses on you here. You breathe salt and diesel and the squeal of brakes, and you spit out grit and someone else\u2019s conversation.\n\nI told myself I liked it, even when I knew I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not that easy to leave, when you don\u2019t know what is yours besides the smell of the water and the corners of streets you learned by heart. When you have nobody to miss you if you go, the place itself digs in its claws. It pretends to be family.\n\nMost mornings I opened Templar\u2019s Fish on the Harbour with a key that stuck and a shoulder that already hurt from nothing. The awning would clatter when I tugged it down. The floor was stupidly wet even before I hosed it, because condensation dripped from the fluorescent tubes like the ceiling was sweating. There\u2019s always a sense of bodies in a fish shop. All those bodies of fish laid out with their sides parted, skin like stories, the ongoing conversation of eyes that don\u2019t look at you but you feel watched anyway.\n\nI\u2019m not good with bodies. Skin can be okay. A bruise is fine. But blood\u2014that\u2019s been tricking me for years. It started like a fainting goat trick, some party act I didn\u2019t ask for. I would be fine, and then I would see blood and be less fine. People think you fake it. People think it\u2019s something you put on. They think, especially here, where everyone stitches themselves closed with fishing line and carries on, that fear is a luxury. They don\u2019t say that. They say, \u201cGet over it, Ellis,\u201d like it\u2019s a puddle and not a trench. They say, \u201cWe all have things, mate.\u201d They pat you. Or they laugh if you topple over near the scallops.\n\n\u201cBriggs,\u201d said Mr. Hobb that Monday. He had ears that seemed to be climbing off his head. \u201cDoor.\u201d He always thought he didn\u2019t need full sentences with me, or the vowels went home early. \u201cIce comes in half an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I said. My mouth didn\u2019t feel like mine. It never did around him. He had a way of turning a person into their hands. I was hands with him: hands to lift, to rinse, to trim.\n\nIf I could have had just fish\u2014no blood, no knives, no cut fingers\u2014I would have taken that deal. I liked the weight of mackerel, that sweet heft. Their patterning like the inside of a church roof. I liked the fast work of snapping bones out with a grip and a twist you learn by watching and not by being told. But blood is not so obliging. It threads itself through the day even when you think you\u2019ll be clever and avoid it. A paper cut in the till. A nick open on the side of someone\u2019s thumb from last week that decides to say hello again at the worst possible moment. And then there was my own skin, which has always been reckless and soft, which lets in the world with too much good grace.\n\nThe ice man came, and the floor turned into a low fog when we spread the crushed snow. It filmed my boots, made them squeal. Kai came late, as he did, swinging his helmet by the strap and grinning like everything is always going to be fine because so far for him it had been. \u201cYou look pale, El,\u201d he said. He called everyone by a nickname as if we were all happily shorter.\n\n\u201cEarly,\u201d I said. \u201cNot awake yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is,\u201d he said, and then he leaned across the counter to pinch a crayfish and made it wave like he was a conjuror. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be a zombie with the rest of us by ten, you\u2019ll catch up.\u201d\n\nWhen customers come, there are two kinds of morning. There is the morning where everything is small talk and change that makes sense and your hands stay your hands. And there is the other kind, where someone wants to tell you about their mother\u2019s gout or the way the price of sandeels is what finally convinced them the country\u2019s gone to hell. You smile, you say, \u201cYes, Mrs. Carrow,\u201d and you pretend your nails are not going numb. The numbness is warning. It says: something will show you red before you can think yourself safe.\n\nIt was a boy. Of course it was. Some boys have made themselves out of dares, like someone dared them to be alive at all and they took it too far. He was the kind with a new haircut that tried to be a decision. He leaned under the sign, he breathed fog on the glass, he pointed at the mullet like he was choosing ammunition. \u201cThat one,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mum said I should choose something oily.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood choice,\u201d said Kai, who liked to convert customers more than he liked to slice. He went to weigh it and tell the boy a price that made him glance toward the world for permission. When the boy agreed, when the notes were wet still, when the tilting of the scale made the fish\u2019s mouth gape\u2014then my knife slipped. There is nothing in the world like the sound of a blade making a decision without you. It was a syllable, a short remark, a yes that was not mine.\n\nI didn\u2019t look first. You learn not to look. I felt the sting and the little hot movement like something alive had woken in my thumb, and I thought, I will not, I will not, it\u2019s too little to count. But the brain has tricks too. You can swear you will be a person who stays on his feet and then you will be a person who is sideways, holding the counter too hard, listening to Kai laugh without malice, listening to the boy say, \u201cMate, are you all right?\u201d which is a question you can answer only with a sound. The sound I made might have been \u201cMm.\u201d It might have been the birds outside.\n\n\u201cJesus,\u201d said Hobb, like a prayer. \u201cNot again.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t on the floor but I became floor-fast; the angle of the metal shelf bit my shoulder and I thought about the way the gulls always find the most brittle edge of a day and lean there. Blood is a colour that turns loud in my head. It is water with a voice. It is thick air. When I see it on me, I become the size of a coin and I fall through the slot that life keeps ready, and out the other side is a quiet I don\u2019t want.\n\nKai had a cloth, he had something cheerful to say about last night, about the match, about the ferry that came in with all its lights out because someone forgot, which we both knew wasn\u2019t true. He held the cloth to my hand as if the colour was not the problem. He said, \u201cOver quick,\u201d and I tried to believe him. The boy took his mullet, and I could feel him take his mullet, and I could hear the door, and someone else came in, and Hobb told me with that pinch in his voice that everything I touched had turned to difficulty.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to faint in a fish shop,\u201d he said when the boy was gone and the counter was empty. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to faint anywhere, but especially not here.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cI didn\u2019t faint.\u201d My mouth went dry because we both knew I had hung on the edge and it was not respectable.\n\nHe wiped the knife on the blade of another knife, which is something he did that made no sense, like sharpening grief with more grief. \u201cIf you can\u2019t manage a nick, Briggs, you can\u2019t manage the rush. I can't be watching you like a baby, we have paying people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said, and the cloth stuck.\n\nYou\u2019d think someone might be curious enough to ask, what is it for you, the blood. You\u2019d think. Mostly they say, \u201cEveryone\u2019s had worse.\u201d Or they say, \u201cMy uncle chopped his thumb clean off and he still finished his tea.\u201d It can be true and not helpful. I tried to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not the pain. It\u2019s not even\u2014\u201d but then Hobb was called by the bell and a woman who wanted to argue about cod, and I stood still and thought about breathing like it was a brand new thing.\n\nAt nine I went for a cup from the little machine that wheezed like it was burning from within. When the lid clicked on, when the steam licked my mouth, I saw behind the counter a thin man standing like a question. People like that always know you. He wore a suit that was brave enough to be the wrong blue, and a tie that had a story I didn\u2019t care for. His shoes knew rain.\n\n\u201cEllis?\u201d he said, as if he had found me hiding and meant to be kind about it.\n\nHere is a thing: I don\u2019t have a lot of people who know me to look at me like that, with welcome that hurts. I am used to being whoever is needed for the moment. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I wasn\u2019t going to pretend.\n\n\u201cBeen a while,\u201d he said. He came to the edge where the glass turned and he smiled, and the smile was wrong on his face for a second, like he\u2019d borrowed it and found the fit too large. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. No reason you would. I know your sister.\u201d\n\nI did something I do when I am not ready for a sentence. I turned the cup and turned it again and I watched the little noise in the lid where steam bursts free. \u201cI don\u2019t have\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTamsin,\u201d he said. \u201cTamsin Keen, from Somers, back when. I\u2019m running an insurance office in North End now, wouldn\u2019t know it, right? But there is no escaping school. She said, you know Ellis, don\u2019t you? I said I knew a boy with a mouth like a question mark and a way of walking like he\u2019s apologising to the pavement. And she said, that\u2019s him.\u201d\n\nMy name in his mouth made something cold shift under my tongue. Tamsin\u2019s name did something worse. It walked into the room like someone you forgot you had locked out, and now the lock is useless. I held the counter. I told my hands to stop being hands and be wood.\n\n\u201cShe said if I saw you I should say hello,\u201d he said, watching me like he knew where the edge was and like people do when they want to go to it. \u201cAnd tell you she\u2019s got work now. She\u2019s doing\u2026 something with events. Weddings. You know, never a quiet day in that.\u201d\n\nA real person would have said, \u201cTell her hello back.\u201d A braver one would have said, \u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d but not in the flat voice that came into my throat. An even braver one would have asked him to describe her hair now, her voice, whether she still shifted her weight like standing still was a lie. I didn\u2019t ask. I said, \u201cRight. Cheers.\u201d The coffee burned my lip. I tasted that instead of all the other things.\n\nHe looked like he\u2019d come to the wrong shop and taken sugar. \u201cShe said the starlings are back on the Common. I thought you\u2019d\u2014you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway. Good to see you breathing,\u201d he said, and then he was gone, as if he had never learned to leave rooms properly.\n\nKai came back in with two men carrying a box of mussels between them, shoulders leaned to a slope. He said, \u201cYou all right?\u201d because he asks a lot of questions as jokes and then sometimes they find themselves serious.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said. He let me be.\n\nAt lunch I took a packet of crisps to the loading bay and listened to the rhythm of the ships, the clank of chain on a boat that looked like a toy in a child\u2019s bath. The sky had a colour I wanted to give a name to. In school they told us poets own all the names, and the rest of us have to borrow. I didn\u2019t have money for that. The gulls were louder to punish us for the chips. I thought about Tamsin the way you think about a light in a house you don\u2019t live in anymore. She isn\u2019t my sister the way she would say she is. We share no blood, no mother\u2019s cheekbones. We shared a bathroom for three years in a house in Fratton where the doors didn\u2019t close properly and the garden was more nettles than grass and the landlord\u2019s name was Marwick but he asked you to call him M.\n\nWe shared a father because I didn\u2019t have one. I had a man who appeared late in my life and said, \u201cSon,\u201d like he\u2019d rehearsed it. Mum had been five years dead then and the state had been grumbling that I wasn\u2019t small enough for attention, that I could heat my own soup. His name was Colin Briggs and I took it because names are coats and I was cold. He lasted eighteen months, the way some lights do. He went out on the water one day and something came down and broke the horizon, and he didn\u2019t come back. In that eighteen months he brought with him a woman who knew the trick of turning a kettle into supper, and her daughter who had sharp shoulders and little patience for my quiet.\n\nTamsin. She had a laugh that was here-we-go and a way of looking over your head like there was a better conversation happening six and a half feet off the floor. You liked her and then you were sorry. That was her trick. Her mother, Rena, acted like this was the best anyone could be, bright and hard; she made tea like medicine and told me my hair needed a story and cut it herself with the kitchen scissors. After Colin didn\u2019t come back, Rena and I startled at each other for a time, then did what people do and stayed because moving takes a different kind of bravery. I paid rent to Marwick by putting cash in an envelope and not looking him in the eye. Rena cleaned the surgery on Elm Grove and brought home paper towels like a crow\u2019s hoard. Tamsin brought home boys sometimes, later girls, and once a dog that turned out to be a fox. We were nothing like a family, and we were the closest thing to one I had had in years. You can be both.\n\nI saw blood on a picture in a magazine once and hit the floor. Rena clucked and said the word therapist the way people say toothache. She made a call and then didn\u2019t make another when the numbers came back with glare on them. The first time I cut myself badly washing a pint glass at the Fawcett, there was a mess and a man with a tattoo of a bird said, \u201cHe\u2019s being dramatic,\u201d and I wasn\u2019t, but it didn\u2019t matter. I learned brakes I could use on myself; I learned to leave the room before the red got writing in it. I learned to be boring. Friends I didn\u2019t have many. People with patience for this particular failure are rare. Kai stuck because he still thought everything could be negotiated with charm and the right shoes.\n\nThere was a Sunday, years ago, when the sky had been white for days and the pavements stitched in frost. Tamsin had come back from somewhere with friends who had eyes like wolves, and they had sat on the steps and smoked and laughed like they had seen a fight and enjoyed it. She went upstairs to change her earrings and I followed because I wanted to ask her to turn the music down and because the smell of her perfume, spiky and brave, made the house feel like a place where stories might decide not to end. I have a shard of memory that shines too large\u2014her standing with a scarf around her neck, red as a Christmas apple, and saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be so poor, Ellis, it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d and me saying something I can\u2019t remember, and her laughing and pushing me like she was an older brother. Then the stairs tilted. That is as far as my head will let me. There is a wall there. If I push it, it moves in small sick inches, and then it snaps back and makes a noise like someone retching. I went to bed. When I woke, a decade had passed. That\u2019s not how time works for people who are well.\n\nWhen Hobb let me go, there was no argument. He said, \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d and I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re good with the old ducks, but I need less drama,\u201d and I said, \u201cOf course,\u201d and then he said, \u201cIt\u2019s two weeks and the time we owe you,\u201d like he couldn\u2019t keep the numbers in his teeth. I nodded. This is the part where you ask for another chance, and I was too tired to pretend I deserved one. The relief on his face was petty but useful. Everyone likes a story where they are the adult.\n\nI went home to the flat that was less a place than a series of corners I knew in the dark. I have had this one for three years, second floor, Southsea side, a view of rooftops that terraform themselves into hope when the sun is low. The carpet is brown that insists on being called something else. The window sighs. The kettle is loyal. My mother\u2019s photo is near the kettle because Rena said that\u2019s where she would want to be, nosy about tea, and I have decided to agree with women who use the word nosy as a blessing. The bed is higher than makes sense, to give the under-space a duty. The drawers stick. The bathroom is a negotiation with mildew.\n\nThe letter was under the door and had been there long enough to leave a faint crease in the thready mat. It said my name on it. The handwriting was a fight between neat and hurry. I knew the loop of the L like the tilt of the town hall. I put the kettle back on its base and my hands were damp and I felt the room step away from me in case I wanted to fall. The envelope was cheap. I opened it as if that would control the words.\n\nEllis, it said, and nothing else for a line. The lines are a story too. You can tell when someone put the pen down and thought, when they went to the window to see if the rain was ready.\n\nEllis, I saw you in the market but I wasn\u2019t ready to say it out loud. I am bad that way. Don\u2019t be cross. I\u2019m doing weddings. Can you imagine. So I can be paid to tell people what not to do, which is the job I trained for by being married to this place. Rena is\u2014well, not so well as we\u2019d pretend out loud, but she\u2019s got her soaps and her tea and her teeth in the right order. I\u2019ll come by. Or you can come to the Common at five, the starlings are a show again. We can be civil if we try. T.\n\nThe T was big and then apologised for itself with a little flick. I turned the paper and there was nothing there. Her smell had been somewhere between cigarette smoke and apple shampoo when she lived in my pockets. Here it was cheap ink, damp. I put the letter on the table and then I put the kettle on again because it seemed wrong to sit, or stand, with that and be dry. I listened to the city for a while. Someone shouted a name out the window and the name answered from two streets over, which is how it goes. The gulls edited themselves into softer. A child started crying and then restarted because his mother told him he was finished.\n\nThe fear does not care for sense. It is like hunger in that way. The letter was not red. My hands found the ghost of a cut beneath the plaster and woke it without touching. My head went to the stairs and refused to go further. It stood on top, looking down, counting the steps it was not going to take. The steps got taller, which is what fear does to stairs. My heartbeat tried on a coat that didn\u2019t fit. I said out loud, \u201cStop,\u201d because sometimes the word helps. It did not.\n\nAt four I walked to the Common because I am not brave but I know how to do the small brave thing that is leave the house when it would be easier not to. The City spread itself like it was pretending to be a painting of itself. The Spinnaker Tower did its needle trick against a sky that had found blue last minute. I walked past a dog that had the face of a judge. The people were out because light had come back and we don\u2019t waste it. The water had the mood where it thinks it is beautiful and then it is. You can sit on the wall and pretend to be sly and no one will notice if you are really just a person who doesn\u2019t know how to begin. I sat. My hands wanted to be pockets but I let them be thighs.\n\nShe stood twenty yards away like she had accidentally invented the path. This is the part where I am supposed to say, I saw her and my heart did a thing. It did, but not the thing you think. It fell into my stomach like a coin lands in a U-bend and gets stuck there to make trouble. She looked like herself in the way you do when you\u2019ve been away from a person\u2019s face and then it is again the face your mind kept secretly drawing in the margins of lists. Her hair was lighter, not honest blonde but the kind of blonde you choose to be, and shorter, and not behaving. Her jaw had made a decision. She wore trainers like she\u2019d made a truce with blisters. She had a coat that was expensive in a way you only get from being near weddings.\n\n\u201cTams,\u201d I said, and the name came out as if the air had practice.\n\n\u201cEl,\u201d she said, which hurt, and she walked and then stopped and then walked again. \u201cHello.\u201d\n\nWe did not hug. We did not shake hands. We faced the birds because it is easier to look at birds than each other. Starlings don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t manage small talk. They made their clouds and then unmade them. They spoke their script on the sky. People clapped for them without knowing they were doing it.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve been doing fish,\u201d she said, as if she needed to come in at an angle.\n\n\u201cHave been,\u201d I said. \u201cDone now.\u201d I held up my thumb as if that made sense of anything.\n\nShe gave me a look that remembered everything and chose not to use it. \u201cStill have the\u2026 thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d My voice was smaller than mine. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cCousin\u2019s like that,\u201d she said, though I had never known she had one. \u201cShe faints if you show her a tomato wrong.\u201d She smiled, because she had to. \u201cI, on the other hand, am blood. Me and it, we\u2019re mates.\u201d She grinned. It tried to be light. It tried to say we were both alive.\n\nI said, \u201cYou wrote.\u201d It was the only brave thing I could think of.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. She kicked at the edge of a square of grass and the grass held. \u201cYou looked like you wanted to be left alone when I saw you at the market. Also, the man you work with looks like if you distract him, he\u2019ll eat someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s accurate,\u201d I said, and she smiled the right way this time, and I felt something in me put down a bag it had been carrying.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Rena?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cLike a houseplant the day before you remember to water it,\u201d she said. \u201cNot too bad. We\u2019re getting her looked at for her knees. She says the doctor is a child and she won\u2019t have a child tell her how to be seventy-one, but she\u2019ll go. She always goes. I\u2019m with her Tuesdays now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look\u2014\u201d I began and then stopped because the words I wanted made me sound like I had been keeping a scrapbook. Different but the same. Better around the eyes. Tired in the places she\u2019d always run. She looked like she\u2019d gone somewhere and come back and pretended it was a different place. \u201cYou look the same,\u201d I said, which is what people say when they don\u2019t know what else to say.\n\n\u201cLiar,\u201d she said, gentler than I deserved. \u201cYou look thinner and older and like you\u2019re pretending not to be looking at the water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am looking at the water,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d She slipped a cigarette out of a pocket and tucked it behind her ear like a joke. \u201cYou still can\u2019t do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay what you mean,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Nobody in this town does. You say half a thing and assume the other person knows the other half because we all went to the same four places when we were twelve. We didn\u2019t, though. You were late.\u201d She nudged my shoe with hers and it felt like school.\n\nThe birds folded themselves into black. The light went slow orange like it had a plan. I thought about the stairs again, and the scarf, and the way air tastes in a narrow hall. I thought of a sound my brain keeps under a cloth like an unkind present. I will not lift the cloth, not here. We are being civil.\n\n\u201cDo you ever\u2014\u201d I started and stopped again. \u201cDo you ever have that thing where\u2026 you remember something and then you can\u2019t tell if you remember it or if you\u2019re making it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what remembering is.\u201d She pulled her coat tighter. \u201cSometimes I think I had a dog when I was little, and then I remember we had Mrs. Farish\u2019s dog for a week and it peed on everything I love and never came back, and my brain went, well, we tried. Also sometimes I think Mum and I lived in a house with a blue door, but really that was a mould incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think about the stairs,\u201d I said. I don\u2019t know why I said it. The birds made a shape like a river. She stilled, and the stilling was loud.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, almost under her breath. \u201cWe said civil. We can do the other kind later. I had to work to learn how to keep tea in a cup and not throw it. I\u2019d like to hold on to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. We breathed. We watched the sky fold into itself. People began to go because they had children and ovens and lives. We stayed because we did not.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have to be at Gunwharf at seven. There\u2019s a couple from Havant, she wants lilies in December and he wants it to cost ten pounds. We\u2019re going to compromise and have cardboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you break them?\u201d I said, and then regretted it, because it was a mean joke and we used to be mean together when we thought that was power.\n\nShe looked at me with her grin that had grown up a little without asking. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t break anything. Not on purpose.\u201d She tilted her head toward the Common and the silent, thrumming thing we had made by being there, the space around us that was between people and not emptiness. \u201cYou going to be all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, which is always one of the names for no.\n\n\u201cYou really should eat,\u201d she said, which was something Rena used to ask me as if hunger was a question I had forgotten to answer. \u201cDo you want to come? I can sort something. Free food. Caterers throw things out if no one looks.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy stomach is not brave,\u201d I said. \u201cAnother time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said. She leaned in a fraction and then didn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it properly. We\u2019ll talk about the things we don\u2019t. I can break out the old knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, before I could catch it, and she blinked. I said, softer, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about knives.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. She turned away. She turned back to say something else and then let it go. \u201cOkay. Night, El.\u201d\n\n\u201cNight,\u201d I said, and watched her leave. She walked like a person who expects ground. Some people do. I pretended to be one while I watched until she was a small shape. I went the other way, toward streets that remembered me better than I liked.\n\nOn the way home I passed a group outside a pub who were arguing about the offside rule as if it were philosophy. A woman on a bike swore at a taxi and the taxi bowed. A boy, too young to be out in that jacket without someone noticing, was sitting on a low wall counting money with his head down like counting was prayer. People are not subtle here. They are brave with their faces. They are cruel with their laughter. I avoid the drink when my head is behaving like a horse that saw a plastic bag and decided it was death, but I went into the public house because I didn\u2019t want to go home and be the only voice.\n\nThe Fawcett had new paint I hated. The tables were the same, and if you leaned your hip against them, they said your name in splinters. The barmaid looked like the kind of person who used to be called girl and knows better now. She said, \u201cWhat can I do you for?\u201d on autopilot, and I asked for a lemonade and a glass of ice like I was pretending to be a soft person.\n\nA man near the window spilled ketchup on his hand, looked at it without seeing, made a joke and smeared it with a napkin. My throat tried to be clever about it; I told it to stand down. The men at the back cheered at something recorded. Kai texted me that I was a child for leaving early and that Hobb was relieved not to have to stand me up in front of the crabs like a lesson. He put four skull emojis like a threat, then a fish, then an accidental train.\n\n\u201cEllis,\u201d someone said, and there are only a handful of voices that can summon me like a stone dislodged by a boot, and one of them I hadn\u2019t heard in ten years except when I was very tired. I turned and the room changed sizes.\n\nRena had the look of someone whose body belonged to the person she was twenty and then remembered otherwise. She had a shopping bag that had lived many lives, and she wore lipstick the colour of old berries. Her knees were angry at her and she had convinced them to be polite. She said my name again, like a scold and a prayer.\n\n\u201cRena,\u201d I said, and the bar folded time for me at no charge.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing in a pub?\u201d she said, like I was a sugar lump she had caught in the flour jar. \u201cYou don\u2019t like them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for the ambient wisdom,\u201d I said.\n\nShe snorted. \u201cYou look terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.\n\nShe was never unkind in the way that makes scars; she was unkind in the way that makes you remember to eat before she sees you. She peered at my bandage. \u201cYou\u2019ve been being stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cOccupational hazard,\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019s your leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot mine anymore,\u201d she said, and laughed, and then she blinked and sat without being asked as if the chair had stood up for her. \u201cI seen Tams.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d I said.\n\nShe nodded in that way she has where her head makes the yes and her mouth says no. \u201cShe says you\u2019re going to try to be civil. I said dear God, not that, anything but nice. You were terrible at that as a boy. Like a cat in shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can pretend.\u201d\n\nShe took my hand and turned it like she was changing the channel. \u201cYou still do that thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still do that thing,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHave you tried not,\u201d she said, and then looked ashamed of the joke, which made it sweeter. \u201cYou know I love you, dear heart,\u201d she said, and she said it like she does, like she was fixing a picture on a wall. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re carrying a football under your ribs. Put it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I lied.\n\nShe looked at the door, because she was always waiting for someone to come through it or fall through it or be dragged. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go to bingo, and you won\u2019t come because you think you\u2019re not old. Come for me, so people will think I matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to step on the sacred cows,\u201d I said. \u201cAnother time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother time soon,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, they say around the estate that Mr. Marwick fell down his own steps last week. Funny what the world will do when you\u2019re not watching it. Cracked his leg like a breadstick. Made a right noise. I heard it from the bins.\u201d\n\nI looked up. The sound of something breaking is my nightmare\u2019s favourite trick. \u201cIs he\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll mend,\u201d she said, with the sourness you keep for landlords. \u201cTamsin says she told him not to carry more boxes than sense, and then of course he did. She was there. She tried to help him and he told her to fly into the sea, like a sideways poet. The ambulance came like they remembered where we lived, and the young man in charge had a nose ring, which suggests I\u2019m a hundred. Anyway. Maybe the rent won\u2019t rise again if he realises he has bones.\u201d\n\nI thought about Tamsin and bones and a flight of steps and the way some legs make a noise when they stop being one piece. Rena drank from my glass with the sort of theft that is family. \u201cHe broke it,\u201d I said, and the picture of someone tumbling down stairs touched the picture in my head that I usually keep under the cloth, and for a second the edges matched, and the room flashed dark as hands.\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d Rena said, because she has always had to go, she has always been late because she is already on the next errand. She kissed my cheek, which is a trick of hers, and smelled of the same thing as ever: the underside of a cupboard and something like cloves. \u201cEat. Tell me you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said, and she pat my face like I was a child and like she could move the bones under there with her palm, and then she was gone, taking the drone of bingo and the plastic purse and the noise of her breath with her.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you about the night that wasn\u2019t now, the night the stairs and the scarf and the way the house breathed wrong. Not yet. The brain makes history a secret because it thinks it\u2019s making us safe. I went home with bread and milk and I put them on the counter like they had done a hard day\u2019s work. I sat until they seemed like furniture. Then I ate, which made Rena win a small invisible point, and I washed up, and I stood with my head against the cold glass and watched the block opposite cough up a woman in a red coat, and my skin remembered another red, softer, and my hand hurt in a way that made it not my hand.\n\nAt night, the city tells stories into the drainpipes and up through the walls. A motorbike argues. A shout comes up from the corner and runs out of breath. A siren pulls its thread through the afternoon; the thread frays and is knotted by someone else\u2019s kindness. My bed is too high. The dark had salted itself with the grey of fog, and there is a boat horn that only blows in the part of the evening where fear has its best boots on. You hear it and you think of leaving and you think of not, and both are the same weight. I fell asleep like a door with one hinge. I dreamed I was older than I could bear.\n\nIn the morning my phone had a message, short and impatient: You\u2019re up? It was Tamsin. I answered yes because it seemed I had been for months. She replied: Pick me up in twenty? And an address I didn\u2019t know and then knew, because this town doesn\u2019t let you keep that privilege. It was near the estate where the corners are the same, near Marwick\u2019s place, near the stairs and the nothing, near all the names we stopped using because they got tired.\n\nI borrowed Kai\u2019s car because he owed me, and because he wanted to be part of everything. \u201cDon\u2019t bleed in it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just cleaned the seats.\u201d He grinned. I took the keys and when I turned the ignition the car started like it wanted to be a boat. The address sat in my head and the streets unrolled to meet it in the way they do, like you made them.\n\nShe was on the curb with a bag that looked too heavy and a face that looked like she could carry it. She opened the passenger door like she owned cars now. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on time,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late for me,\u201d she said, which was a joke and not a joke. She put the bag in the back and then said, \u201cWe have to go to the warehouse on the industrial estate by the park. Don\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d I said, because she didn\u2019t look like she had had sleep either.\n\n\u201cHad a night,\u201d she said, and her mouth did the thing where it pretends. \u201cMarwick was being a twat. Now he\u2019s a twat with a cast.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were there,\u201d I said, careful like you handle glass.\n\n\u201cAnd you know how he is when people tell him anything,\u201d she said, and it was the Tamsin I knew, the one who can put knives in her laughter and make you cut yourself on it. \u201cHe said, I can carry these down, I\u2019m not dead. I said, don\u2019t. He said, do. The stairs said, no, thank you. Now you know the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the ambulance,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou can watch the tapes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou like that sort of thing. You can watch me not cry. He tried to blame me for gravity. I told him to go to hell because I am my mother\u2019s daughter. I don\u2019t think you ever liked him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never knew we were allowed not to,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWe are now,\u201d she said. \u201cGrow up.\u201d\n\nThe car smelled like someone else\u2019s work. She switched the radio on and off and on. \u201cI might be,\u201d she said. \u201cI might be doing something new and something foolish.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always are,\u201d I said. The road let us pass and the water did that thing where it puts metal in your nose. We turned where the bed shops begin to fight with the furniture stores, where there are boxes on boxes and the whole of it looks like someone\u2019s life mid-sorting. I looked at her hands on her lap and thought, I know those hands. I know their map. There is a scar on her right index where the fox that was a dog taught her about hunger. There is a whitened line on her wrist where she fell off the bike she stole from me in the April of the year we were terrible.\n\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d I said, and she looked at me like I had picked up a stone that belonged to both of us.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCarrying other people,\u201d I said. \u201cWeddings. Lifting boxes. Doing the being brave. Does it hurt or does it help.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the way of it.\u201d\n\nAnd then, before the warehouse, before the strong coffee, before the boxes of vases that look new but aren\u2019t, before the woman in the office with the nice eyebrows and the anger, there was the sound. It came from the right, from the estate. It sounded like a bone giving up. Like a piece of furniture turning into words. She went still in the seat like she had learned that stillness is a language. I turned the car without thinking where the road would allow, and we were there in front of Marwick\u2019s building which is not anyone\u2019s name for it but we lend landlords our words.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs was a man whose face had decided this wasn\u2019t a day he owned. He wasn\u2019t Marwick. He was the one who borrows a ladder and doesn\u2019t return it. He had his hand on his shin and his shin was making angles that do not belong to shins. I looked, by accident, once. That is all it took. The world went into a narrow tube and the tube was a colour I don\u2019t like, and my throat said, here we are again, and my hands said, we will be unhelpful now. The man swore, in ways I admired, and Tamsin said, \u201cYou stupid bastard,\u201d and she ran to him and ran with a steadiness that is not mine.\n\nShe did not go gentle. She took my belt and put it round the man\u2019s calf above where the wrongness was blooming, and she did it like she had spied on training and kept the notes. \u201cYou are not going to die,\u201d she told the man. \u201cYou are not even going to get to enjoy morphine, because you do not deserve joy. I told you not to lug those options down by yourself.\u201d She had her phone with the emergency line in it and she spoke into it like she was giving the orders to a kitchen.\n\nI saw the belt, I saw the skin, I saw the shape of a leg that was now many legs. The air filled with the river sound that comes when my head has had enough. I held the metal railing and my knuckles tried to pretend they were bone. I could taste the side of a penny. A small part of me walked away and stood on the grass and explained to nobody that it was Sunday and that this was not right.\n\n\u201cEllis,\u201d said Tamsin without looking at me. She knows the chemical names of the storms in my blood. \u201cSit down. Put your head between your knees. You\u2019re no use upright. You\u2019re no use at all, but I do love you.\u201d\n\nI sat. The concrete had an opinion about my trousers. The man groaned and made noises that were not words and were not the wrong kind of quiet either. An old woman in a dressing gown flapped on the landing and gave me a stick of peppermint for no reason I could name. When the ambulance came, quicker than it does on television, the man who got out had a nose ring. Rena never lies. The woman with him had eyes that had seen every kind of night. Tamsin briefed them like she had employed them. The man with the nose ring looked at me just once and then stopped seeing me because I was background furniture like a cactus. It was a relief.\n\n\u201cNice job,\u201d said the woman with the eyes, to Tamsin, which made Tamsin stand taller for a second and then pretend to stoop. \u201cYou in the trade?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Tamsin said, and if ever a sentence had the feel of prophecy it was later, and I could not know it then.\n\nThey splinted the man. They did the things with straps that I cannot watch on television without walking out. They did not make more red in the world. They were kind the way people are when the kindness will cost them nothing. The man said his name was Arthur like that would help. The old woman cried as if she was practicing for something worse. When the lift of the stretcher made Tamsin put her hand to her face for the first time since it began, she did it with the back of her wrist, quick, a child.\n\nAfter they left, after the little round of nothing that follows, the courtyard looked like a stage that had forgotten its plot. Tamsin lit the cigarette she\u2019d been keeping and then didn\u2019t smoke it. She looked at me like I might make a joke for her, and I didn\u2019t. She said, \u201cSee? I told you. Gravity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou okay,\u201d I said, as if I had a right.\n\n\u201cMe? I am the picture of health,\u201d she said. \u201cYou, on the other hand, look like someone wrung you out.\u201d She touched my shoulder. \u201cWhy do you keep doing this to yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t choose it,\u201d I said, and the wind stood up between us like it had something to say. \u201cDo you remember\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and I shut my mouth because she had put the word up like a wall and painted it with a threat. \u201cDon\u2019t, Ellis. Not yet. You\u2019ve always had a way of opening things that need to sit shut. We can do that in a room, with biscuits, when I\u2019ve slept.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, and I placed the word obedient on my tongue and let it dissolve.\n\nWe went to the warehouse like it was what normal people do after a man\u2019s leg decided to be two. The day kept going, because it does, because nobody asked if we were okay with that. The boxes were heavy. The woman with the eyebrows admired a set of plates as if money were an emotion. Tamsin told her a schedule and I watched her build a day out of sentences in a way that made my chest ache. I thought about a piece of paper and a scarf and stairs and breath and the way your brain tells you something and then takes it back. Did I say I killed her? Not aloud. Not yet. The word killed is not a light word where we are. It hangs around your neck like a job.\n\nWhen I took her back to the address, the steps were clean now, which was a miracle I understood. She said, \u201cSame again tomorrow,\u201d and I said yes because I am a yes person until I am not. She leaned into the car, her face inside the window but her feet still on the world, and she said, very soft and very ordinary, like it was what we do, \u201cYou know I should be dead,\u201d and then she shut the door with my answer still in my throat and went up the stairs with the kind of speed that comes from not wanting to hear the response.\n\nI drove to the sea with the windows cracked and the radio chewing old songs. The gulls had a committee meeting and didn\u2019t invite me. The tide put its tongue out at the wall. When I closed my eyes, the sound of bone turning itself into sticks played and played like a song stuck on, even though I hadn\u2019t seen the worst of it. You can smell pain in the air; it\u2019s not a lie people tell to make themselves feel interesting. It smells like the last cupboard in the kitchen you didn\u2019t open. It smells like pennies.\n\nI slept badly and dreamed worse. When I woke, there was a taste in my mouth that had a time attached to it: ten years exactly, or nine and some change, a New Year with the cheap rockets going off over the Common, a night the frost drew patterns on the cars like white flowers that don\u2019t live. I could not help it. The cloth lifted. The stairs came. The scarf. Her laugh like a knife you intend for bread. The push that can be a joke until it isn\u2019t. The sound a body makes when it meets the hard. The sound that is not someone else\u2019s bone, not Arthur\u2019s, not Marwick\u2019s. The sound that is the shape of guilt. It was me. My hands. My clumsy and my anger and my inability to be anyone else. I had not known how to carry anything. I had made myself into a person who drops things when he sees red because once I dropped someone.\n\nAnd then, like the tide taking pity, the memory took itself back again and left me with only the after-taste and the sweat. My hands were my hands again. Somebody was shouting outside in a voice that belongs to bins. My kettle changed the subject with its thin scream. I stood there in the small kitchen and watched water become more itself and thought, I am not safe from the past, but maybe I can be stubborn in the present. Maybe I can bunk off my own head for a day or two.\n\nI texted Tamsin: Tea? That was all. The word had worked for us before. The word might be a boat.\n\nShe sent back: After work. Big day. The sort where I break things. And a kiss that I could pretend meant nothing.\n\nI turned the tap and let the water run until it stopped smelling of pipes. The city outside was already arguing with its own noises and I had another day to go and be a person who doesn\u2019t faint and do a job I might not keep and love people I maybe can\u2019t afford. The fear was awake. The memory was not fully. The gulls began again. The day stood up.\n\nIn the mirror over the sink I made my face say, we carry on. It doesn\u2019t look like me when I do it. That was fine. I didn\u2019t need to be me to survive. I only needed to be someone who could wait in the noise until the next piece of the story arrived.The morning after the kettle changed the subject, I went back to Templar\u2019s because wages are a thing even if dignity is not. The sky was a lid and the gulls were already arguing with the bins like they were owed an apology by plastic. I told myself I would go, I would stand in the steam of ice and bleach for ten minutes, I would say thank you to a man who thinks saying less is a leadership style, and then I would leave without knocking over anything that cuts. The bell above the door rattled like loose teeth and the cold air inside carried the comfort of wrong choices you know by heart. Hobb was at the back with the books, licking his finger as if money needs tasting. He glanced up and did a whole conversation with his eyebrows about how long I had taken, then remembered I was doing him a favour by existing only briefly.\n\nHe slid an envelope across like it might explode if he made a bigger movement. It had the weight of Thursdays and the lightness of all the other days. Kai leaned his elbows on the counter and made a face that wanted to be sympathetic and ended up being sunny because that is his only coat. \u201cYou all right?\u201d he said, as if we had had a different week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, and the word did what it always does, stood in for a yes and hid a no like a coin in a shoe. \u201cYou still a man who lends cars?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man who collects favours like bottle caps,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cYou still going to marry the sea if no one stops you? Watch yourself, she bites.\u201d He slid me my last bacon roll on the house like he was commemorating something, and for a second we were boys and then we weren\u2019t.\n\nHobb cleared his throat as if a small bird had got stuck in the pipes. \u201cAnd the key,\u201d he said, picking at a ledger corner with a nail that looked like it had been cut with anger. \u201cAnd your apron. And if you could resist writing a poem about it all over the internet, that\u2019d be grand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the internet,\u201d I said, and it was almost true, and it made Kai snort into his sleeve. The key went heavy into his palm like the end of a story you\u2019ve been reading and pretending you don\u2019t mind the last page. I wanted to say something like sorry, like thank you, like I am not as useless as I look, but those sentences require a spine I couldn\u2019t find this morning, so I said, \u201cGood luck for Christmas,\u201d and turned into the air.\n\nOutside the day was trying to be a bright thing and succeeding for the rich. Mrs. Carrow walked past with her bag-for-life that had given up and become a bag-for-now, and she said, \u201cEllis,\u201d in a way that told me she had a list of gripes ready for whoever had hands. I nodded and dodged on instinct, and then I nearly walked into the thin man in the brave blue suit. He had the expression of a person who knows what he looks like in a reflection and prefers it to reality.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he said, the word warm and watchful. \u201cWe keep bumping.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d I said, then softened because his tie had tried so hard and failed. \u201cWhat do you want me for?\u201d The envelope in my pocket trembled like a small animal.\n\n\u201cWitness statements,\u201d he said, and I hated that the shape of his mouth could make the shape of trouble so polite. \u201cAbout Mr. Marwick\u2019s little flight. Liability, see. The Council like to pretend steps are no one\u2019s responsibility until a man\u2019s leg reminds them of gravity. I\u2019ve got a form that says you can put your name down as a person who saw. And your\u2026 friend\u2014Miss Keen\u2014she\u2019ll need to talk to me too. Off the record, of course. Nothing to worry yourself with. I\u2019m just collecting truths, the way the sea collects glass.\u201d\n\nThe word friend stuck in my ear and made itself a bed. I wanted to tell him that truths are not bottle caps and people are not shelves, but then I remembered that he knew Tamsin from school and probably believed that knowing was the same as owning. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything until it was already a mess,\u201d I said, careful with the edges. \u201cThe ambulance saw more than I did.\u201d\n\nHe nodded like he knew how memory works and had watched it crumble in good light. \u201cAlways the way. Look, don\u2019t be a stranger. I\u2019m with Dalloway & Sons on the corner. We do the grim things so other people can keep their hands clean. Tell Tamsin I asked after her. She\u2019s a firework, that one.\u201d He smiled his poor borrowed smile and drifted away, leaving the smell of aftershave that wanted to be a yacht.\n\nI took the long route back along the water, because the water will have me even when people won\u2019t. The ferries made their slow declarations out of harbour, and I watched them the way men watch each other\u2019s shoulders in a bar fight. There is a lesson in the way something huge can move with that much grace if you stop insisting on going where streets tell you. I considered the number for the GP pinned to the cork board by the kettle at home, a paper that had been there so long even the drawing pin had a groove. The last time I called, the receptionist had a voice that thought I might be making sickness up for attention, and I had hung up before she could offer me an appointment in March. I rehearsed it again: hello, a problem with blood, vasovagal, yes I know the word, no I don\u2019t want to waste your time, yes I am doing the breathing, no I am not getting better and if anything I am turning into a man-shaped faint. The seagulls heckled like old men against benches. A child licked a lamppost to see if it would freeze his tongue, and his sister watched like a scientist. The world stays stupid, which is sometimes a blessing.\n\nAt midday, with a heat that wasn\u2019t really heat under the pale sun, I took Rena to the GP because she has a particular way of losing appointments unless someone stands at her elbow and reminds her she is loved. She hates lifts because they do their work while looking smug, so we took the stairs and she swore at each one as if naming them was going to make them fall out with their own legs. The waiting room was full of the particular variety of chairs that punish you for sitting wrong. A man coughed as if he wanted to expel his own past. A poster about bowel cancer had a cartoon intestine on it with eyes, and Rena tutted and said, \u201cNot everything needs a face.\u201d\n\nShe pinched my cheek the way you pinch dough to see if it will rise and then peered at me in the brighter light from the window. \u201cYou look like you slept in a sentence,\u201d she said. \u201cNot even a good one. You should put your name on the list. Talk to a person in a cardigan about how your head likes to play dead. It\u2019s free unless you want it to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said, watching a nurse who was too young to carry that much tired. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said, and she was both wrong and my mother. \u201cYour man with the nose ring saved Arthur, by the way. He came back later with forms and a smile and you know I don\u2019t trust a smile on a Tuesday, but I trusted that one. He told me there\u2019s a course you can do, to learn to do the holding and the pressing without making more of a mess. Community responders. Looks good on a CV, he said, as if mine isn\u2019t already an opera. I told him I was too old, and he said people don\u2019t stop bleeding just because you\u2019re seventy-one.\u201d\n\nRena has a way of giving me my next hour without asking if it fits. I filed the words away under maybe, like you do for chores you suspect might save your life. A woman with a baby sat down opposite and the baby stared at me with the rudeness of the new. I pulled a face and the baby solemnly pulled one back, and for a moment I felt exactly the right size for the room. Rena nodded to herself because she likes me better when children don\u2019t cry.\n\nWe got her seen and we got her prescriptions and we got out before the walls could start swapping names, and I took her home to her flat where the carpets smell of boiled cabbage even on days no one has seen a cabbage for months. She showed me the plant she\u2019s keeping alive by arguing with it and told me to go and be in the world and not supervise her, because she didn\u2019t need me to watch her make a sandwich as if the bread might leave. \u201cSix,\u201d she said as I went, a number without a noun attached. \u201cYou coming to mine to watch the quiz and shout the answers like a smug parrot. I bought a cake that tastes of lemon if lemon was poor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d I said, and she kissed the side of my head as if I had earned it.\n\nTamsin sent me a voice note at two. She does that because texts make her impatient and calls make her feel like she is performing. It had the sound of wind and feet and her breath doing that fast thing that is not quite panic and not quite joy. \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing anything except staring at water and bothering old ladies, I need a pair of hands at the Waverley. The couple have decided the chair bows are the wrong white and I need someone to pretend to be useful while I murder a ribbon supplier with my mind. Also you can carry boxes. There might be canap\u00e9s in it for you. And you owe me one for not letting you lick the pavement at Arthur\u2019s. Twenty minutes.\u201d\n\nThe Waverley is a hotel that acts like it could be in a better city. It does its best. Its lobby has a carpet you could get lost in and a piano that has forgotten what a tune is, and the staff glide like they took ballet once and decided to keep the posture. I found Tamsin near a pyramid of champagne coupes that looked like a dare. She wore a shirt that made her look like she knew where the exits were and her hair in a knot like a sailor. She saw me and did a version of a wave that seemed to think waves were for other people.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, handing me a crate that was heavier than it looked. \u201cUpstairs. Don\u2019t look at the bride unless she talks to you. Don\u2019t tell anyone your last job. Don\u2019t faint. If you do, do it somewhere photogenic.\u201d She took three boxes herself and walked with that easy authority of someone who has just decided she knows what she\u2019s doing and hopes no one argues before the decision settles.\n\nThe function room was all white around the edges, as if someone had erased its history, and in the middle was a mess that only money can make. Flowers lay everywhere like wounded. Men in narrow trousers argued about chair placement as if chairs are political. The bride stood with a look I have seen on men in court, a look that says the day is too large and too delicate at the same time. Tamsin marched past it all, issuing calm, pretending that control is a substance you can hand out by the ounce. I followed, relegated to a moving backdrop, which is my comfort.\n\nWe tied sashes, which is a work of theology in this town; people will go to war over a bow. We laid cutlery in a way that pretends knives have never done harm. We faked an ease that must have looked convincing because the bride eventually unclenched enough to cry and laugh in one movement and asked if she was a terrible person, which is the thing all brides ask when they have spent the morning commanding chandeliers. Tamsin did her voice like balm and told her she was a perfect monster, which is to say perfect, and the woman laughed in relief and went to be painted again.\n\nIt was going to be almost fine, and then the groom\u2019s uncle cut his finger on a box of wine because justice likes to play small jokes. It was nothing as far as the body is concerned, a nick where a flap of skin looks like it wants to be dramatic and then thinks better of it. For me it was a note from a song I try not to remember. He held up his hand to the light like he was auditioning for a saint, and for a second the red said hello in the middle of the white, and the room narrowed to a tunnel that made the hotel into a ship. I felt my neck go cold and my fingers lose the plot. The glass stem in my palm felt like a throat.\n\n\u201cEllis,\u201d said Tamsin, without looking, as if we had rehearsed this in secret. Her voice pressed a hand to the back of my head and pushed my gaze away from the colour. \u201cString lights. The ones in the crate. Behind you, left. Go be clever with electricity.\u201d She was already moving toward the uncle, already having a plaster appear out of air, already commandeering a waiter\u2019s black napkin as a bandage and a prop. Her hands did the thing hands do when they\u2019ve seen worse and made it better. I turned and walked like I had been told how, and the string lights were a patient animal who didn\u2019t know where its head was. I breathed the way the internet says you should, in on four, out on six, pretending to blow on a match. The world un-tunneled. The uncle made a joke about being a martyr and declared himself in love with Tamsin and his wife did not argue because some loves are only allowed for emergencies.\n\nAfter the ceremony, which happened with the right amount of tears and none of the wrong, we stood by the kitchen door and ate the offcuts of vol-au-vents like stray dogs. Tamsin chewed and leaned her head on the wall, closing her eyes in that way that means she is checking something inside is still there. \u201cI like this part,\u201d she said. \u201cThis feeling like you\u2019ve [held] everything together with string and gum and then no one sees the string. It\u2019s like\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like when you used to balance on the wall by the little park and I would hold my hand a centimetre from your back and you\u2019d swear you could feel it even if I wasn\u2019t touching. That.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have been a surgeon,\u201d I said, watching a chef swear in French to a pan that was definitely English. \u201cOr a general. Or God.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo much paperwork,\u201d she said, and then, with her mouth full, \u201cDo you know I wrote to the ambulance place. The nose ring man\u2014Adam\u2014told me they do those courses. He said if you\u2019re good at bossing people kindly and you don\u2019t mind lifting weird things at three in the morning, you can be one of them. I said I mind blood and he said everyone does until they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love blood,\u201d I said, and she made a face as if she was the one with the phobia.\n\n\u201cI love being the person who decides what it means,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing. Weddings are all triage when you think about it. Only with lace.\u201d She licked pastry off her thumb and saw me look and hid her hand like a trick. \u201cYou could do it,\u201d she said, and I laughed, because she is funny.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want someone who keels over at the sight of a raspberry,\u201d I said. \u201cI could drive the ambulances and vomit out the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou underestimate how much they need drivers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd how brave it is to be the person who holds the door open without fainting in it.\u201d Her face went strange for a second, soft and wicked at once. \u201cAlso. You have a nice voice on the phone. You could talk a man out of dying just by telling him about the weather.\u201d\n\nIn the lull between speeches and dancing, in that awkward hour where the men who eat too fast take off their ties and the bridesmaids discover their shoes are not loyal, Tamsin dragged me into a side corridor that smelled of bleach and hotel secrets. The lights hummed. She pushed a door that said Staff and we went into a room full of folded tablecloths that looked like sleeping ghosts. She shut the door with her heel and leaned on it, looking at me like she had walked a long way with a question on her head.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the scarf,\u201d she said, and she said it as if the word had a wire in it.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I said, though the truth is I remember it like you remember a dream someone else told you. \u201cRed. You said I looked poor in it.\u201d The room tilted almost invisibly. I felt the part of my brain that keeps the cloth begin to fidget.\n\n\u201cI said you were poor,\u201d she said, and her smile fought with itself until it lost. \u201cWhich was true, but I meant mean. I meant mean like withholding. I was horrible. I was being the person I thought I had to be to not be eaten. You looked at me like a dog looks at a hand with rings on it.\u201d She rubbed at the scar on her wrist like she was polishing a memory. \u201cI keep thinking if I start it, if I pick up one thread, then the rest will come and we\u2019ll know if we\u2019re supposed to hate each other or just buy a cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cCake is cheaper,\u201d I said, and then the atmosphere in the cupboard of linens strangled my joke for me. \u201cI think I pushed you,\u201d I said, because I am the man who fills silences with knives. \u201cOr I think I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m choosing the story where I did because it gives me someone to punish. I remember the stairs and I remember the sound and I remember your laugh like a blade and that scarf and then I remember nothing until years had passed and you were not dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot dead is one of my better tricks,\u201d she said, and the corner of her mouth lifted with old spite. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that. It was later. It was\u2026 no, not here. Not with confetti like dandruff outside this door. It was not you, and also I am not letting you off that easy. You were a bastard that winter. You were so careful with your kindness that I thought you had none. You wanted me to deserve your attention, like a prize. I was used to a different kind of cruelty. Yours was new. You know this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was nineteen,\u201d I said, like it was an excuse, and she snorted.\n\n\u201cWe were all nineteen,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of us made it to twenty without pretending to be statues.\u201d She reached and touched my face with two fingers, quick as if she was turning off a radio. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill me,\u201d she said, and it was the simplest sentence in the room. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. You might have wanted to for a second because I was unbearable, but you didn\u2019t. I am alive by accident and stubbornness and a nurse who yelled at me, and that\u2019s a story for a bus stop, not a hotel. Get out of the cupboard before I make out with you because the place where fabric is folded is our ancestral home.\u201d\n\nWe went back to the noise, and I carried plates and watched her keep people from discovering disappointment. The band played Brown Eyed Girl because things like that must be endured, and the father of the bride cried into his own pocket because all men are five when it comes to letting go. We finished at eleven and slid through the service entrance like thieves, and the night outside had a texture like breath on skin. She leaned against the brick, letting the cold steal the heat from her back, and lit the cigarette she had been storing behind her ear since the Common. She didn\u2019t smoke it. She just watched it burn and go out and held it like a wand that could make the day stop if she shook it hard enough.\n\nWe went to Rena\u2019s like children, because she said six and it was nine and she\u2019d pretend to be cross and then put a piece of lemon cake in our hands regardless. Her flat was warm as turnips and crowded with the kind of rubbish only love keeps. The quiz shouted and the kettle did its war cry and Rena said, \u201cYou got thinner and prettier and I don\u2019t like either,\u201d and then kissed us both as if we were her idea. We sat on her rug and ate cake that tasted like it wanted to be forgiven. Rena asked how many bones are in the ear as if we were in a bet, and Tamsin made up numbers with the authority of a minister.\n\nIn the adverts, a voice chirped about washing away blood in a way that made both Rena and me swear in stereo. Rena muted it by hitting the remote like a rat. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the time your mum cut her thumb trying to be a hero with a tin of peaches,\u201d she said, and I said yes because she tells this one in winter. \u201cShe bled like it was a show and then laughed because she\u2019d made a mess on my new towel, and then she went white and fell down like a girl in a Victorian novel. Only time I ever seen her do it. She said, I\u2019ve been waiting years to get away with fainting. She said, don\u2019t be greedy with your drama, Rena. I told her I\u2019d be greedy for both of us. God, I miss that cow.\u201d\n\nWe did not look directly at sadness. We watched it from the side like a train. Tamsin had a way of holding her mug that made me think she had been holding something hot for a long time and her skin had adapted. She put her head on Rena\u2019s shoulder and Rena rolled her eyes because she thinks affection is a trick, but she didn\u2019t move away. \u201cThere\u2019s a man,\u201d Rena said into Tamsin\u2019s hair, without preamble or permission. \u201cHe works at the docks. He came round asking after you. I said who wants to know and he said a man with paperwork, which is not a name. I told him to go to church. He\u2019s got that look like he could sell you a sofa, only the sofa would belong to someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurance,\u201d I said, and both women winced like I had said dentist. \u201cFor the steps. He wants witnesses with neat pens. He thinks the truth is tidy if you put it in boxes.\u201d\n\nTamsin made a face that said she could take a box and make it a hat. \u201cWe can give him what he needs and not what he wants,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m good at that. I have a degree in it. He can ask me what I saw, and I will say, I saw a man think he was bigger than friction. I saw a town that needs new stairs. I saw myself tell him no and be ignored. I did not see God.\u201d\n\nWhen I walked home, the night had put fog on and the lamplight made cones like a cheap show. My flat was there like it had been every day I was missing, and on the mat was a leaflet Rena had pushed under earlier when she wasn\u2019t pretending to have respect for boundaries. It said NHS in a polite blue and had a photo of a woman listening to a man as if he was more interesting than anyone else had ever been, and the headline said Talking Helps in a tone that could make a grown man cry. There were numbers. There were promises. There was the suggestion that you should not have to pay to be told you\u2019re not mad.\n\nI put it in the drawer where elastic bands go to die and then I took it back out because I have learned that ignoring paper does not make paper less sharp. The kettle shrieked and I let it. The flat breathed in its creaks. Somewhere a car alarm declared war on nobody. I gave myself the small obedience of filling in a form. It asked me to rate my sadness from one to ten like sadness is a service. It asked if I had thoughts that were unkind to myself and I ticked a box as if that could make a difference to the way my heart does its work. It told me someone would call within two weeks and I thought two weeks is a way to describe forever.\n\nSleep came in chapters and left between them. I woke to a message from Adam, the nose ring paramedic, because Rena is a woman who can get numbers out of anybody without paying. He wrote like a person who has no time to fuss and some time to care. There\u2019s a community responder training on Wednesday at the community centre by the lido, his message said. No blood. Just maps and pads and how to talk to people\u2019s fear. You\u2019d be good at the talking. Bring someone who likes to argue with chairs if you want. He put a smiley and then killed it with a full stop.\n\nI stared at the line about no blood until it felt like a dare. I screenshotted it and sent it to Tamsin with a question mark like a teenager. She sent back a thumbs up and then, after a beat, a second thumbs up because she has never known when to leave well enough alone. I put the phone down on the counter and watched it glow like a small, smug fish.\n\nThe day did what days do; it arrived whether I wanted it or not. I went to the harbour and I let the cold make my fingers ache into their own shapes. I watched a ship come in looking like a cardboard cut-out until it got close enough to have teeth. A boy kicked a ball against a wall that did not care and I wanted to tell him to kick a different way but then I thought perhaps he would find it for himself and resent me less. My feet took me toward North End without asking if that was clever, and I found myself standing outside Dalloway & Sons looking at a cardboard accident in the window. The poster had a man lying under an oversimplified car, smiling because that makes it all right, and under him the words said We Make It Easier To Heal, which is a lie and also what you want to hear.\n\nInside, the man in the wrong blue suit looked up and his face lit like a shop train set. \u201cEllis,\u201d he said, as if we were children who had met at the swings. \u201cYou came in of your own free will. That\u2019s rare and therefore valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to tell you to leave Rena alone,\u201d I said, because I had misjudged my own courage and now I had words and nowhere to put them. \u201cAnd to take my name off whatever list you have that says I saw anything useful. I didn\u2019t. I saw a man on a floor decide to become a problem and then got told to sit down by a woman who has earned the right to say that forever. Write that on your form.\u201d\n\nHe folded his hands and looked like a person who prides himself on not blinking. \u201cI grew up in a town where if you didn\u2019t tell the truth early, someone else told it for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the bad man here, Ellis. I\u2019m trying to get the Council to look at what it has been ignoring since the eighties. It helps my client and it helps your mother and it helps the old woman in the housecoat who thinks peppermint fixes legs. If I have a letter with three names on it, the stairs might get fixed and you might not have to watch another shin try to make a right angle. Help me put a weight on the scale.\u201d\n\nHe had put the word mother in his mouth like a match and blown on it. I wanted to lift a chair and throw it at his soft face and then I wanted to go home and put my head under the pillow until there were no stairs left. \u201cRena isn\u2019t my mother,\u201d I said, and then because that sounded like betrayal I added, \u201cShe is. She\u2019s the kind that counts. And if those steps get fixed because you got signatures, I\u2019ll sign. But you don\u2019t go to her flat like you want tea. You send a letter like a person who knows doors are ladders.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, slowly, and for a second the wrong blue suit looked right on him because he had remembered he was a person inside it. \u201cI\u2019ll send letters,\u201d he said. \u201cBring Miss Keen to the training if you can. The paramedics like converts. And tell her I still think she should have been captain of the netball team even if she didn\u2019t go to practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to hell,\u201d I said, kindly, and he laughed in a way that made me consider not hating him for five minutes.\n\nOn Wednesday, we went to the community centre with its smell of old chlorine and biscuits. The room had a dozen chairs and a line of mannequins without faces lying on the floor like a quiet crime. A woman with hair like authority stood at the front and talked about how hearts lie and lungs want persuading and how fear is a thing you can talk to as if it\u2019s a badly behaved dog. Adam stood at the back with his arms folded and his nose ring making a small, defiant star, and he nodded at me like we had saved a life between us which is generous.\n\nWe learned where to put our hands without breaking ribs and how to count without the numbers running away. We learned to peel the back off sticky pads with more confidence than I thought I had left. We learned to say \u201cI am here\u201d in a tone that does not make things worse. Tamsin rolled her eyes at all of it and then executed compressions with a seriousness that made the room take a breath, as if it had been waiting for someone to treat the plastic like a person. When it was my turn, the fake chest was cold and my arms shook and my mind tried to go to the red place and I made it stay. Adam crouched next to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing it. Don\u2019t think about whether you can. You are,\u201d and it was the kind of sentence that might have saved me at sixteen if anyone had thought to say it.\n\nAfter, we stood outside and the sky had that particular Portsmouth purple that is made of sodium lamps and doubt. Tamsin bounced on the balls of her feet because she can\u2019t keep still when her brain is pleased. \u201cI liked the part where it worked,\u201d she said, grinning in a way that made me want to lie down on the pavement and declare myself done. \u201cI liked the part where the machine told you what to do and everyone stopped pretending they don\u2019t need machines. I liked the part where you didn\u2019t fall over. You see. You can be in a room with the idea of death and not punish yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was plastic,\u201d I said, but the protest came from far away. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had a chest,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rest we can compromise on.\u201d She looped her arm through mine like we were at school and she\u2019d just stolen a biscuit and wanted me to run. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said, and there it was again, a promise without details. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about the not-dead. You can tell me about the boat. We\u2019ll be kind and we\u2019ll be wrong, and then we\u2019ll be right. And then we\u2019ll eat chips. There\u2019s a plan if I ever heard one.\u201d\n\nAt home that night, I took the leaflet out of the elastic band drawer and put it on the fridge with the magnet that says Southsea is Not a Phase in a font someone thought was clever. The kettle sang because that is its only party trick. The pipes muttered and the walls learned my name again. The stairs in my head did not go away, but they had dust on them now like things that have been left in lofts, and perhaps I could climb them without breaking. The city made its noises and each one I let be itself. In the morning, the gulls would start and the post would bring letters addressed to the boys we used to be and we would send them back or open them or burn them and either way, we would be here. The day stood just over the horizon like a man thinking about a dive. I stood in my kitchen and practiced saying, I am here, in a voice that did not tremble. The mirror over the sink looked at me as if I had lied and decided to forgive me anyway.In the morning the wind came up the street as if it had somewhere else to be and was offended to find me in its way. The kettle watched me the way a suspicious aunt watches a party, clucking under its breath, and when it boiled I poured and forgot to drink because my mouth was busy rehearsing an apology for something that hadn\u2019t happened yet. The city wore its weekday face, all fluorescent jackets and early arguments and the kind of laughter that comes from the throat because the head is still asleep. I put on the coat that thinks it\u2019s bigger than me and texted Tamsin that I would be at the front with small coins and patience. She sent back a single fish, then the knife emoji by accident, then an apology made of a dolphin. I put my mug in the sink in the way that says to yourself you\u2019ll deal with the cup\u2019s feelings later, and I went out into a day that had already started without me.\n\nChips smell a certain way on a wind that comes from the east; there\u2019s vinegar in it, and fat that has learned to admit it\u2019s going to live forever, and the sour of paper that\u2019s been damp more than once. The hut on the front had a queue like a sermon. The boy inside had hair that would cut your fingers if you touched it. I ordered two and said yes to salt because no is a joke we don\u2019t tell in this town when offered anything warm. I sat with my back to the wall because I am that kind of animal now and I watched the water pretend to be mild. A gull landed on the bin and gave me the look that says, I know your address. When Tamsin arrived, she came in sideways like she was overtaking the air. She had a scar on her knuckle I hadn\u2019t catalogued and trainers that made a case for comfort as a political position.\n\n\u201cYou look like you didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said, pleased, which is how you know the people who know you. \u201cGive me that. I\u2019m going to eat it wrong and offend the fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoin the committee,\u201d I said, handing her the hotter paper. \u201cI have a list of things I\u2019m not sleeping about if you want to trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never trade,\u201d she said, blowing on a chip as if it would listen. \u201cI hoard and then pretend I divvied. You ready for the horror story or shall we talk about sauces first.\u201d\n\n\u201cSauces won\u2019t help,\u201d I said, and the gull made a sound as if it agreed. \u201cYou said not-dead. You said nurse. You said later. I\u2019ve been introducing those words to each other in my head and they keep eloping.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not glamour,\u201d she said, and the tone of it told me that what followed would be a plain room with a bright light and not the costume drama my fear has paid for. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a knife-wielding spectre or a romantic illness. It was a bike. Of course it was a bike. This town breeds the urge to be on two wheels and too fast because the roads are small and nobody respects how big their car is. I was twenty-one and I had a job at a place where they pretend to be surprised when you return a dress with the tags still on. I was late, because I was always late, because I thought being on time meant they owned you. The mirror on the bus on Eastern Road had ideas about how much space its elbow needed. It tapped me in a way that would have been flirtatious if it weren\u2019t metal, and I introduced my whole self to the tarmac.\u201d\n\nShe said it like a list, but the space between the words had black ice in it. She licked salt off her thumb and looked at the water so that I could look at her without getting in trouble. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the first bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember thinking, oh, I am sideways, and then I was under a cloud that was a siren and someone said my name right. The nurse was a woman of an age where she had no patience for you thinking you were the first to try dying. She said my name like she was swatting a fly. She said, stay here. She said, open your eyes. She said, if you go to sleep you\u2019re going to make me shout and I\u2019ve had a day of shouting. She kept me going with rage. I liked her for that. The paramedic had brown eyes and a ring in his nose and he had hands like the underside of a boat, and he said nothing dramatic, he just said, I\u2019m here, with the calm of someone who\u2019s already seen the drama go wrong elsewhere. My head did its private bleeding in places you can\u2019t put a plaster, and then it stopped, because it decided to. I should be dead, by the numbers, if the bus had loved me more, if the ground had been ice, if the woman in the nurse shoes had been less tired. I am not dead because of physics and a person who refused to let my eyes close. It wasn\u2019t you. You weren\u2019t near. You were probably looking at water, being an arse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am often being an arse,\u201d I said, and felt my insides move round to make space for this new furniture. \u201cSo it\u2019s a story about a bus and a woman with a voice that doesn\u2019t forgive. Good. I can be jealous of both without being complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story about how death is boring, mostly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about the way a town can try to kill you with its elbows and fail. It\u2019s a story about how after that, I thought, well, if something is going to get me it had its chance and it was clumsy. It made me bold in a stupid way for a year and then it made me careful. More boring. You\u2019d have liked me. I didn\u2019t shout at strangers in shops. I set alarms. I bought better helmets. It\u2019s not a story for a book. It\u2019s a line.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a story for a book,\u201d I said, offended on its behalf. \u201cIt goes like this: a woman met an ordinary disaster and decided to be extraordinary at not dying. That\u2019s a plot.\u201d\n\nShe snorted and stole the end of my sausage like a sibling. \u201cTell me yours,\u201d she said with her mouth full, rude. \u201cNot the blood. I don\u2019t care to audit your syncope. The other one. The stairs. You\u2019re carrying it like a child carries an egg to school and you\u2019ve got yolk on your jeans.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said later,\u201d I said, stalling badly. \u201cYou said not here, not then. You said bus stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a bus stop for the rich,\u201d she said, nodding at the shelter where a woman in sunglasses pretended to read a timetable. \u201cWe can start or we can wait and let it rot and go soft and then it will leak. Your choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know enough to tell it,\u201d I said, miserable with the accuracy. \u201cWhen I try, the memory puts me in a lift between floors and pipes the same song in from both sides. There\u2019s the scarf. There\u2019s your laugh that wasn\u2019t kind that day. There\u2019s me being nineteen and useless. There\u2019s a noise that belongs to bone and floor and the part of my brain that likes to punish me has put it on loop and told me it\u2019s you. There\u2019s a second version where we both stumbled, and then the cut scene, and then I\u2019ve made a person out of guilt and he sleeps in my bed. I don\u2019t know which I\u2019m more afraid of, that I did it or that I didn\u2019t and I chose to wear it for fashion.\u201d\n\nShe finished the chips like a woman who has to leave no evidence and folded the paper with more care than it deserved. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill me,\u201d she said again, not holy, just sure. \u201cYou did not. You were a bastard and a boy and you let me run the knife too far because you liked watching me be sharp. You didn\u2019t push. We were loud. We were not sober enough to be doing stairs. We frightened the wall. There was a bruise that looked like a continent. There was a week where I told everyone I had been mugged by gravity because it made a better story than, I was an idiot with a friend. There is later to talk about. There are rooms we haven\u2019t built yet for the talking. But not this, El. Find another coat if you need to be cold. Not this one.\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t known that words could be analgesic in that exact way, dulling one pain while leaving the rest deliciously raw. I breathed and the world came back with it. The gull on the bin screamed at a child because that\u2019s how you teach the young. The water did a thing with the light that was not for us. Tamsin dug into her pocket and produced a crumpled receipt covered in numbers that could be time or money and wrote the name ADAM on the back in a hand that talks too loud. \u201cWednesday,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the thing where they teach you how to press without breaking and how to talk without lying. You can be the bit of the team that keeps people in their own bodies. It\u2019s a skill. We\u2019ll be the kind of citizens people put on leaflets. You can sign your name to the hellman\u2019s man after if you like, get your stairs saved. I\u2019ll choose us where I can.\u201d\n\nWhen she is forgiving, it feels like you are the right size for the doorway. When she is commanding, it feels like being told to breathe by a person who knows more about breathing than you do. We walked along the front until the wind had finished with us, past a dog with a jumper knitted by love and a man selling hats even the hats were embarrassed by. She took a phone call in which someone at a venue declared that white comes in seventeen shades and she resisted explaining the existence of light. I stood near a bin and was human until the call ended, and then we were ourselves again, which is harder and better.\n\nThat afternoon a man came to put tape across the steps where Arthur rehearsed disaster and the tape was the particular yellow that wants to be crime and settles for caution. The tape sagged in the middle like hope. A child peeled a corner and her mother smacked the air next to her hand instead of the hand itself, which is a little genius Rena invented years ago. Dalloway & Sons had sent letters and the letters had the tone of a man who once wore a prefect\u2019s badge and is now paid to correct you gently. Rena had hers on the table under a lemon and said, \u201cWe\u2019re being consulted,\u201d like a complaint and also like she knew the importance of being seen even if the seeing is done with clipboards. She had her knees up on a second chair because the doctor had said to rest them and she was obeying in the way that is still an argument. \u201cI\u2019ll sign,\u201d she said, because she likes to be useful. \u201cI\u2019ll say I saw a man think he was better than stairs and the stairs say no. I\u2019ll say fix the stairs and fix the man and fix the part of this town that thinks people are too cheap to save.\u201d\n\nWe took her to the surgery to get the injection that would clean the edges of her pain without making promises it couldn\u2019t keep. The nurse there had the eyes of someone who collects spoons and stories. She swabbed and tapped and stabbed and Rena swore in the old language that isn\u2019t a language at all, and I nearly went sideways because the reality of the needle made my head overconfident. The nurse kept talking to me as if I were the patient and to Rena as if she were the accomplice. \u201cYou breathe,\u201d she said to me, which is a cruel thing to remind a body to do. \u201cYou don\u2019t look. You look at me and you tell me what you had for breakfast and you lie well.\u201d I told her about toast that had not existed and she rewarded me with a nod that did more for my blood than the glucose tablets in my pocket. Rena flexed like a woman showing off an engine. She said, \u201cI was very brave,\u201d and the nurse said, \u201cYou were tolerable,\u201d and wrote something down as if the pen needed the exercise.\n\nA week turned itself into several without permission, the way weeks do when you hang too many jobs on them and none of the jobs are called stop. I signed the paper for the stairs with the same biro I use for lists about milk and lies, and the Dalloway man phoned to say thank you in a way that meant keep going. The tape became a scaffold and the scaffold became proper steps, and the day they took the scaffold down three boys slid on the edges in celebration and Arthur shouted at them from the window like a bell. Tamsin booked three weddings in rooms that smelled of carpet shampoo and hope and one on a patch of grass by Canoe Lake where an old man fed swans and we were all a little afraid of him. I went to the community centre on Wednesdays and let Adam teach me about geography and premise more than he taught me about blood. He told me the slang the ambulance uses for the half-awake half-dead, for the street names people who weren\u2019t born here can\u2019t pronounce, for the ways bodies lie to you when they want attention. He said, \u201cSay I am here even when you\u2019re not sure you are,\u201d and I did, and sometimes I was.\n\nThe first time the pager went off in my pocket I nearly threw it into the harbour on reflex because it made a noise like a terrified insect. It buzzed and this is the thing phones no longer do; it assumed I could read information under pressure. The message said COPD, male, late seventies, breathless, and then a street I knew too well to need the postcode. I texted Tamsin the way you text when adrenaline sews your hands together, and she sent back, on my way, like we had been doing this for years. We met outside a house that had once been a shop and now was four flats and none of them had curtains that fit. A woman in a dressing gown opened the door and let us in the way a mother lets damp into a kitchen; helplessly, with ceremony. There on the sofa was a man the shape of a coat on a hanger, chest hitching like a hiccup had gone wrong. His name had four letters and three of them were tired.\n\nI did the thing they taught us about kneeling so your voice is a place and not a problem. I said my name, which is always the first bridge, and he said his as if he was apologising for choosing a small one. The room smelled of dust and that plastic Tube smell you get from a new kettle. Tamsin found the inhalers without asking permission because she has learned that permission is not necessary when someone can\u2019t remember how to say yes. I counted with him, long in, longer out, and he glared at me the way people glare at metronomes. The noise in my pocket said the ambulance was three minutes and that\u2019s a lie those noises tell to keep you brave, but they weren\u2019t far off. We didn\u2019t change the world. We kept him in it. When Adam came in with his machine and his kindness and his too-cool ring and put the mask on and the numbers began to behave, he looked at me and said, \u201cGood voice,\u201d and the part of me that is twelve did a handspring.\n\n\u201cI like the quiet ones,\u201d the man\u2019s wife said at the door, pressing a packet of custard creams into my palm like a medal. \u201cThe ones who don\u2019t need to narrate. You can come again when we do funerals. We do them on Thursdays.\u201d\n\n\u201cSave it for a Wednesday,\u201d said Tamsin, pocketing the biscuits as tax. \u201cHe likes a schedule.\u201d The old woman snorted and shut the door on our nonsense and the street put its noise back on as if we had not been inside a moment when time slowed enough to let a man borrow a breath.\n\nNot every call was kind. There was a boy with a mouth that couldn\u2019t find enough air because he had run to the bus and his chest didn\u2019t understand panic\u2019s math, and he cried when I put my hand on his back the way boys do when they\u2019re fourteen and furious at their bodies. There was a woman outside the co-op with blood on her chin because she had fainted elegantly and met the pavement with her mouth, and that one was a war in me and I lost the first round by looking, and Tamsin put her broad palm on my shoulder and turned me the way you redirect a horse and said, \u201cFetch the water and be nice to it,\u201d and I did, and someone else did the napkins. There was a man with his wedding ring stuck because he\u2019d got fatter from relief after his wife recovered and now his finger had opinions, and we cut the ring with a tool that made me respect metal while a stranger told me the entire plot of his favourite film because fear makes you generous with narrative.\n\nOn a night when the common smelled of fireworks left over from other people\u2019s birthdays and the foghorn sang its basso in the channel, Kai came round with a bag of pears as if he had foraged them and not bought them because they were on special. He sprawled on my one good chair as if it were his shape and told me he was thinking of moving in with a woman whose name made him go red and whose mother had a cat that liked his shoes, and he asked me if I was going to be all right without him ten minutes away, and I told him I was a grown person with a kettle, and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not, but I\u2019ll pretend you are,\u201d and I said, \u201cBuy a plant to impress the cat,\u201d and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s a different woman,\u201d because he likes to be adored. He looked at my leaflet on the fridge and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re an absolute weirdo,\u201d and he hugged me in a way that got me in the ribs and left, and I stood there in the small kitchen and let the room be too quiet, which is another kind of training.\n\nI saw the Dalloway man once in the market standing too near the fish. He was buying samphire like apologies and when he saw me he made the face you make when you\u2019ve run out of synonyms for persistent. He told me the Council had conceded that the steps were theirs and would in future be stairs that love feet, and he told me Arthur had received enough compensation to buy a mobility scooter that went too fast, and he told me he had a client who needed a witness for a different kind of fall, and I said, \u201cI am not your binoculars,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll change your mind when someone you love trips,\u201d and I said, \u201cThat happened a decade ago and here we are,\u201d and he put both hands up because he likes to end conversations looking like a man who can be trusted. He said Tamsin had declined to be eloquent for him, and I said, \u201cShe saves it for weddings and lawless boys,\u201d and he laughed like someone who wished he\u2019d been invited to be lawless.\n\nOn the Tuesday after the stairs remembered their job, Rena called me in a whisper to say, \u201cCome quick, there\u2019s a fox in the kitchen,\u201d and when I got there it was a very ordinary cat with a torn ear and an opinion about bread, and we fed it tuna and called it Mr. Spence because that was the landlord\u2019s boss at the surgery and he deserved to be reincarnated as a scavenger. Rena made tea that would singe your hair and told me with relish about a woman at bingo who had called another woman a cheater because her lucky dabber was too lucky, and how this had escalated to the point where security had been mentioned as a concept, and how Rena had diffused the situation by pretending to faint in a way that did not involve any blood, and how she\u2019d got her friend a second book of numbers out of it because nothing soothes the savage heart like a discount. She told me to take my shoes off because they dragged the world over her floor. She told me to put my shoes back on because my socks were an insult. She told me she was proud of me for not doing a dramatic Victorian fall in someone else\u2019s hallway, and I told her she made it easier to stand up. When she fell asleep in the chair with her mouth open on the second advertisement break, I turned the volume down and rolled a cushion under her head with the care you use for a bomb. Mr. Spence watched me with the bored loathing of cats and then made an audible decision that I might live.\n\nWe made a small habit of it, me and Tamsin and the Wednesday training and the occasional pager with its angry bee, and the Saturdays where I was the winter-coat presence at the edge of a wedding, holding a glass steady while someone tried to cry without ruining eyeliner, or carrying flowers that smelled like all the good days had been boiled down. On a Thursday she made me go with her to the registry office because a couple had argued all the way to the door and now couldn\u2019t find the extra breath to make vows, and she stood behind the registrar like a stagehand with a god complex and nodded at the right moments, and when the woman said I will, I saw Tamsin make the smallest fist by her side like she had scored a goal. On a Monday we walked past the house where Marwick\u2019s blinds were crooked and she told me he\u2019d taken to shouting at the television because it doesn\u2019t shout back with the particular obscenity he prefers, and she had told him to be kind in case he needed kindness later, and he had told her kindness is just the long way to weakness, and she had told him he was wrong and would learn, and we both looked at each other because we are still waiting to learn.\n\nThe night we finally made the bus stop out of air and stood under it like good citizens and told each other the history we\u2019d owed, it rained the way this town likes to rain, sideways and petty. There is a bus stop at the end of Palmerston that is a rumour in winter and a kissing booth in June, and we took it from two girls wearing eyelashes like moth wings and one boy who pretended he had a date with the driver. The plastic was scratched with declarations that had outlasted the relationships. The schedule had been replaced so many times the pin had made a permanent hole. Tamsin tucked the cigarette behind her ear because she knows when to use her mouth for other work.\n\n\u201cIt was not you,\u201d she said, and the echo from all the other times she had said that didn\u2019t make it less. \u201cIt was me and a man who wore aftershave like a threat and a ring that didn\u2019t fit his finger. It was his stairs because he\u2019d just got the flat and men like to show you their steps, like they made them. There was a party that was a room of men pretending beer is personality. There was a joke I made that he didn\u2019t like because it made him visible to himself, and he didn\u2019t know how to be visible without falling apart. He put his hand on my throat in the way of someone who has watched too much telly and learned the wrong lessons from it, and then he took it off because he is not a murderer and because there were witnesses and because the world is not a show. I went downstairs in a way that was almost a run, and I missed the third, and my knee took a holiday from my leg, and the nurse with the eyebrows held my face while the man with the nose ring did a thing with a splint and I thought, this is what happens when you flirt with men who want to be doors. Not stairs. Doors. That\u2019s the story of the nearly dead with my name on it. The stairs you\u2019re guilty about are the stairs you were irritating on. You were not hands. You were a boy. It\u2019s not flattering. It\u2019s better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to put it down,\u201d I said, and the relief of wanting is its own kind of weight. \u201cI want to put it down and keep it on a shelf where I can be reminded without being punished.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d she said, and then laughed at the look on my face because it was too easy a sentence to be true. \u201cBut you\u2019ll pick it up again. That\u2019s what we do. We tidy and then we rediscover mess and then we find better boxes. I will hold it sometimes for you. You can hold mine sometimes when I would like to pretend I was never stupid. We will be terrible at it and then a little better. And we will be civil when we have to be and kind when we can be and cruel only when someone is trying to put a hand on a throat. How\u2019s that for a vow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d marry that,\u201d I said, and she made a face like a priest caught laughing.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get grand,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a man whose brain can be undone by tomatoes. Keep humble.\u201d\n\nA bus came and huffed and opened its door like a mouth and looked at us as if to say, are you getting on or are you always going to be this. We shook our heads in unison and the driver smirked because there is nothing drivers like better than being right about you. We walked home the long way past the arcade where the children of men who never learned to lose were teaching their sons how to shake a joystick until it cooperated, past the photo booth where a couple were trying to understand how their own faces could change so much from frame to frame, past the shop that sells high-visibility jackets and hope. My phone buzzed with the small emergency of a woman who had cut her thumb making soup for a neighbour, and I sent Adam three question marks and he sent back a postcode and a thumb and a heart. We went and put a plaster on a person who shouldn\u2019t have been alone with knives, and I said I am here in a voice that didn\u2019t tremble, and Tamsin mugged at me behind the woman\u2019s back until I snorted and had to pretend to cough.\n\nLater, at my sink, watching the water do its science, I caught my face again in the little mirror and tried the mouth that says we carry on. It fit better this time and that frightened me and soothed me both. The kettle made the house sound like it was thinking. The gulls had stopped for the day as if a supervisor had come round and told them there would be forms if they continued. The city ticked its radiators. Somewhere, in a different flat, a newly mended man tried not to shout at the news because stairs have a way of teaching you about what breaks. Somewhere else a nurse took off her shoes and put on her ordinary feet and let the evening have her. Somewhere else again a bus driver went home and did not talk because holding other people\u2019s schedules in your head all day is its own silence. I washed a cup and did not cut my hand and felt like a magician who refuses to show his sleeves.\n\nAt the end of the week Adam said there was a football match and the ambulance service had too few hands for too many lads who think singing is first aid. He asked if I could stand by the gate with a bag full of water and stern words, and Tamsin said she would come because she likes to watch men try to be serious in shorts. Fratton Park had its winter lights up because football has its own seasons that ignore weather. The air tasted of onions and jealousy. A boy not yet old enough to regret anything threw up on his own shoes and a man old enough to be his grandfather told him to aim better next time. We stood with our arms crossed like bouncers in a comedy sketch and gave out plasters to the kind of cuts the day has on it when it\u2019s nearly funny. In the second half there was a scuffle with more choreography than harm, the kind where everyone wants to be stopped and nobody wants to admit that, and Tamsin inserted herself with the skill of a pint in a crowded bar and said, \u201cNo,\u201d in a tone that belongs to mothers and magistrates. The knot un-tied. A man with a white scar at the corner of his eye stared at me like he\u2019d met me before and couldn\u2019t place where, and then he nodded in a way that said, not today, and the game resumed pretending to matter.\n\nOn the way out a woman tapped my arm with the special permission reserved for people who\u2019ve watched you be useful and therefore own a small part of your time. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re the fish boy, aren\u2019t you,\u201d and I said, \u201cNot anymore,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood,\u201d and we both laughed because there are jobs that take pieces of you and leave you with scales. She told me her daughter wanted to be a paramedic because she\u2019d watched a video on the internet of a man being revived in an airport and decided that was the only magic worth learning. I told her to tell the girl to practice saying I am here without sounding grand. She said she would and then she told me she had never known what to do with her hands and now she did and I said, \u201cPut them in your pockets,\u201d and she said, \u201cIn this town they call that attitude,\u201d and I said, \u201cThen buy better pockets,\u201d and she clapped me on the arm like I had told a joke that made sense to both of us.\n\nThe next morning the Dalloway man sent a photograph to my phone of the new steps with the ribbon cut, some councillor who looks the same in every town holding the scissors and pretending to have done anything except sign, and under it a caption that said, you did this, and I wrote back, the man\u2019s shin did this, and he sent three laughing faces because he is capable of humility in pixels. I showed Rena and she said, \u201cAbout time,\u201d and then cried in the kitchen where you are allowed, and I put my hand on her shoulder and left it there even when she made the face that means, get off me, I am not sentimental, because I have learned to translate.\n\nAt the edge of sleep, nights, the stairs still come. They arrive like a child with a story they need you to hear at two in the morning. The scarf is still red. The sound is still itself. But it is in a room with other sounds now, the ship, the kettle, the bus. It is a citizen. That is what I am trying to be. Not healed. Not clean. Present. Available for the noise and what it makes of a day. When the pager goes, I put on my coat. When Tamsin calls, I answer. When Kai texts a picture of a plant that is dying and asks me how to make it live, I tell him to stop talking to it like an enemy. When Rena says, \u201cHeaven is a council house with stairs that don\u2019t kill you,\u201d I say, \u201cAmen,\u201d and mean it. I say I am here into the mirror, and sometimes I believe it long enough to say it again to someone who is not me.The wind did that January thing where it makes everything feel underdressed. It came off the water with pins in it and threaded itself through the gaps around my window like it had paid rent. The kettle sulked and clicked and got on with the job. I stood with my hands around the mug and told them to believe in heat. The city had been threatening a storm all week, the streetlights jittering like nervous horses, the ferries testing their horns as if to remind us they could be opera when they wanted to. Rena called at eight to say the bingo had been cancelled in advance because the hall roof had ideas, and she sounded put out in the way she only gets when fate thinks it\u2019s funny. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to rain, it should rain,\u201d she said. \u201cNo half measures. I\u2019ve set out pots on principle.\u201d I promised to come over later with bread because bread is how we pretend to be ready for anything, and she told me to bring the good jam because she was not in the mood to be poor in that way.\n\nBy ten the sky had made its choice and come down. The street outside my block turned from road to river in the time it takes to swear and mean it. The gulls tried to hang in the air like mugs on a rack and mostly succeeded because arrogance is one of their better tricks. The pager went before the rain hit its rhythm. It rattled in my pocket and made my ribs remember every time a phone has had bad news. COPD again, said the little screen, like an old friend you don\u2019t have the courage to tell to stop calling, and a building in Eastney I knew by its habit of peeling paint. I texted Tamsin out of muscle memory and she sent back a single umbrella and then, as if she had thought better of leaving her meaning in pictures, I\u2019m five away, and I put my coat on in the way you put on armour you don\u2019t entirely trust.\n\nThe stairwell smelled like damp bread and old laughter. I hit the street and the rain hit back, thick enough to make you feel like you were swimming upright. The road to Eastney was an argument between taxis and vans and one man on a bike who had convinced himself he was immortal for the morning. The power lines hummed like a low choir. I cut across by the lido, its water slopping at the edges, green as if it had kept a summer it wasn\u2019t allowed. Tamsin appeared out of the downpour like a conspiracy, hair slicked to her skull, mouth set in the line that means she\u2019s already decided this will be fine.\n\nInside the flat was the collected smell of a life that had fought damp and not always won. The old man in the chair had lungs playing a drum solo badly. His wife had two blankets, neither of which was doing what blankets pretend, and a face that had set like plaster around a shape it didn\u2019t want to admit to. We did the thing we knew: introductions, your name is a bridge, count with me, the long out breath like you\u2019re bullying a candle, you are not alone. The oxygen machine in the corner had a red light on that wanted to be an alarm if someone gave it permission. \u201cPower\u2019s been flicking,\u201d said the wife. \u201cIt thinks it\u2019s a club.\u201d The mask hissed and offered cold air like a mean charity. Tamsin perched on the arm of the chair because chairs tell her their intentions, and I took the old man\u2019s hand because hands lie less than mouths and I wanted to know if he was willing to stay.\n\nWe were halfway through the numbers when something upstairs happened that the building didn\u2019t like. It was a thud with a note in it that made my bones tune themselves, and then the thin shout of someone saying a name that wasn\u2019t being answered. Tamsin looked at me as if to ask whether the noise was in my head and then we both moved because if it wasn\u2019t, we were late. The old woman clutched my sleeve as if she was claiming me for her team, and I said, \u201cTwo minutes,\u201d in the tone you\u2019re taught for emergency promises. Tamsin took the stairs two at a time and I went less prettily and we came round the turn to find a door open and a green runner rug crumpled like a letter.\n\nHe was sprawled halfway across the landing, a fishing jacket on that made him look like he\u2019d tried to prepare for weather in the privacy of his home. His hair had the white of a man who has recently stopped pretending to dye it. The radiator had come loose in the fall and the sound of it trying to be attached to a pipe and failing was a kind of whimper. There was blood. Of course there was blood. It had a way of finding me even when I took the scenic route. It came from his scalp, which is to say there was more of it than my brain believed a head should have, ridiculous amounts that chased themselves down the side of his face and into the rug, making patterns that would have interested me in another life. He made a noise that reminded me of the beginning of a laugh, which is a terrible thing for a body to do when it\u2019s trying to convince you it\u2019s unhurt.\n\nMy throat did the small close over it does when red is in the room, a sympathetic door. The trick is to get ahead of that door before it slams. I said, \u201cHello,\u201d loud enough to bully the colour back into being just a colour, and then I did the thing they showed us with head wounds, that dance between knowing it looks worse than it is and not letting it be worse than it is. Tamsin had the kit open and the gauze in my hand before I had properly asked. \u201cPressure,\u201d she said, and the word is so bossy it helps. I folded and pressed and looked at the skirting board and his eyes and the nail in the plaster where a picture used to be, anywhere except the theatre of it. The man said something about wet and cold that might have been a joke or a complaint. I said my name again because sometimes it\u2019s the only tool I have that bites.\n\nHe did not like me. This was obvious in the way he tried to pull away as if my face offended him. He had the kind of posh the navy gives a certain kind of boy and he wore it even lying on his own carpet. \u201cYou\u2019re the fish lad,\u201d he said, which would have made me laugh if my mouth weren\u2019t busy being useful. \u201cThe one who fainted over a sardine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t faint,\u201d I said on instinct, which made Tamsin smirk because she likes me better when I argue myself into being visible. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be friends you and I. I\u2019m going to give your head back to you if you let me.\u201d The gauze warmed under my hand. The red tried to behave. The radiator clunked like a drunk trying not to admit it. Tamsin had called Adam without telling me she had moved and then moved again; I watched her mouth make words that would fetch a vehicle as if she were ordering bread.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re touching me,\u201d he said, like it was a surprise and a complaint in one.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cI am here.\u201d The sentence just came out of me. He made a face like he\u2019d heard that before from someone he hadn\u2019t wanted to trust. I kept talking because the part of me that is twelve had learned how to take over the speaking when blood tried to run the show. I told him the thing about starlings at the Common and how they managed to fly without leaking into each other, and he looked at me sideways and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a strange boy,\u201d and I said, \u201cMan, technically,\u201d and he said, \u201cDebatable,\u201d and then the room let me breathe.\n\nAdam arrived with a woman I didn\u2019t know and the air changed as it always does when someone whose job it is to stop endings enters. They put their hands where mine had been and told the bleeding to be less dramatic. There was an exchange about blood thinners and the word warfarin that always sounds like a ship. The woman asked him how much he\u2019d had to drink and he told her the truth with the sheepishness of a man who has lived in a place where everyone knows if you lie. Adam looked at me and nodded in that way that says, see, you didn\u2019t run, and my head did the thing where it measures its own edges and finds them intact.\n\nAfter, back downstairs with the old man and his oxygen that had decided to behave now the building had calmed and the electricity remembered duty, I found myself shaking just in the fingers, the rest of me bored with the idea of panic. The old woman patted my wrist like a pigeon pecks bread, distractedly affectionate. \u201cHe\u2019s a bastard,\u2019 she said, meaning upstairs, which told me more than the fall had, \u201cbut he\u2019s our bastard and he plays whist on Thursdays and he knows where the good chips are.\u201d Tamsin said something kind that sounded like a threat, and we left with the rain making our hair into a statement.\n\nAt noon the whole of Southsea became candles and teaspoons because the power decided it had had enough of work. Shops put handwritten signs in windows and discovered their pens were failing too. The bakery sold out of buns in twenty minutes and then stood there like a stage set, full of flour and apologies. The Spinnaker looked like it would like to take the afternoon off. I went to Rena\u2019s with the bread because the one thing we can control is sandwiches, and found her sitting in the dark with a torch under her chin like a child telling a ghost story. She was delighted with herself because she had boiled an egg on a camping stove and not set fire to the curtains. \u201cI told the boy upstairs not to light his barbecue in the hall,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me if I was the fire brigade. I said today, love, everyone is the fire brigade.\u201d\n\nWe played cards by the window and cheated with total sincerity, and she told me stories of storms with names that used to matter and how they had measured them by which tiles went and whose cat by. The fear in me had been given a job that morning and it had worked hard and was sleepy. I felt almost like a person who could be relied upon. When the lights came back on at four the whole building gave a sigh like an old woman sitting down in a good chair. Rena hissed at the bulb for being presumptuous. \u201cI liked us better in the dark,\u201d she said. \u201cYou looked less worried.\u201d I told her she looked like a queen in a power cut and she told me to stop being a fool and pass the butter.\n\nDalloway sent a text at six that made me grimace even before I read it because his name in a line looks like a judgment. Can you and Miss Keen come in tomorrow? it said. Marwick\u2019s solicitor is asking for statements about a separate incident. The words separate incident rattled in my head like a coin in a jar. I showed Tamsin without comment and she made the face that means she is deciding whether to set something on fire or file it neatly. \u201cHe\u2019s like lichen,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice him until he\u2019s everywhere.\u201d\n\nIn bed the rain did its hard work on the glass and I listened to it argue with the gutters as if they owed it money. The city hummed with the relief of lights being lights, the fridge coming back to its small vocalising, the neighbours putting on the television with a kind of vengeance. I let the day replay in my skull like a tape I couldn\u2019t misplace if I tried. There was red in it. There was the thunk of a skull against a skirting board. There were my hands doing a job my brain had held back from for years. There was a sentence that had crawled out of me without being invited and yet had the right name on it. I am here, I had said, to a man who didn\u2019t want me touching him, and he had not died out of spite. I fell asleep with that in my mouth like an aspirin.\n\nMorning came out of the east the way it likes to, with the look of someone who is trying to be friendly and is not sure how. Dalloway\u2019s office had the thermostat set to a temperature meant to disorient your softer parts. His assistant had a haircut that gave her people skills she pretended not to own. He poured us water as if we had come to confess a murder. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he said, which is precisely what you say when it is. \u201cMarwick\u2019s ex-tenant is making noise. She claims he shoved her in the doorway last autumn when she came to ask about her deposit. He says he didn\u2019t. The stairs got blamed. They always do. I need people who have lived in his buildings to say what kind of man he is around his doors.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s jaw made a shape I had been introduced to in kitchens and corridors since the day I met her. \u201cWhat kind is that,\u201d she said, very mild.\n\n\u201cThe kind,\u201d said Dalloway, fussing with a paperclip like it was a pet, \u201cwho might push without thinking because the world is in his way. Or the kind who has never in his life lifted a hand to anyone who didn\u2019t deserve a handshake. Either will do, depending on where you\u2019re standing.\u201d He looked at us with that particular male hope that women might offer him a dramatic truth because it would help his paperwork be a poem.\n\n\u201cWe can say he is the kind who thinks other people\u2019s time is soup he can drink,\u201d said Tamsin. \u201cWe can say he is the kind whose voice gets louder when you say no. We can say he is the kind who borrows ladders and loses receipts. We can say stairs don\u2019t like him. But you don\u2019t get to make me do your job without paying me in something better than gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want money?\u201d he said, surprised, which told me he hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the principle of the city.\n\n\u201cI want my people not to have to prove they\u2019re not liars,\u201d she said. \u201cWrite your letter so it says what it should whether I sign it or not. And write him a letter that says be small in future. You know how to do that. Pretend he\u2019s a council.\u201d She stood up without giving the chair time to argue and I followed, because she goes through doors like a weather system and you take your chances.\n\nOutside on the pavement that always smells faintly of fish because of the shop three doors down, she put her hands in the pockets of her jacket like a man in a photograph of a band. \u201cWe don\u2019t owe him our blood,\u201d she said, as if the morning were a person who required telling off. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the stairs. We do not have to become the kind of people who turn every memory into a court.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would be very good in a court,\u201d I said, and she pulled a face as if I had insulted her by complimenting.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll make me buy a suit and then I\u2019ll become the version of myself that sends emails at midnight. I like being the version of myself that knows the exact number of chairs in a room without counting.\u201d She glanced at my hands in that habit of hers that pretends she is not checking if I am shaking. I wasn\u2019t. I might later, but I wasn\u2019t. She looked pleased in that way she never admits.\n\nThe town ran like it does when weather has had its say and lost. We worked a wedding that pretended to be under control and was not, because the band were two hours late after being sent to the wrong Waverley by a text with a typo and the groom\u2019s mother had a nosebleed that looked like a disaster but was just a conversation stopper. I held a napkin like a banner and looked at the ceiling while Tamsin tilted heads and told fear to stop shouting. The bride decided at the last minute that she hated lilies because they smelled like sadness, and Tamsin put her arm through mine and said, \u201cWe will fetch more roses,\u201d and we did, consulting with a florist who acted like he had never seen panic before and wanted to keep it as a pet.\n\nOn the way back, carrying too many stems for a man with my centre of gravity, we cut through the little park near the library with the willow that thinks it lives by a lake. A man was sitting on the bench with a dog at his feet that looked like it had been compiled from spare parts and a bottle of whiskey in one hand like a fairy tale, and he was crying with his mouth shut. I don\u2019t see myself in a lot of men but I saw something of my worst self in him, that determination to be stoic and therefore in trouble. Tamsin slowed, almost imperceptibly, and the dog lifted its head with that particular dignity dogs have when they haven\u2019t been treated right. I stopped because I have learned that sometimes stopping is the actual job.\n\nYou doing all right, mate, said Tamsin in a tone you can lift people with. He nodded in a way that meant no and yes and don\u2019t you dare. The bottle had writing on it that wanted you to think it was a friend. There was blood on his knuckle where he had punched the wrong thing. I felt the old horse in my chest start to drag its hooves and I told it no. I said my line. I am here. It is a ridiculous sentence out of context. It is sometimes the only one that turns a room back into a room. He looked at me with the special contempt a certain sort of man reserves for tenderness and then he gave up and started talking and he did not stop for long enough for Tamsin to ask the questions she had in her pocket. His wife had gone two weeks ago to her sister\u2019s in Fareham and he had used the quiet as an excuse to become smaller than he had been promised. The dog had been unfed in the way dogs are unfed when men are ashamed. He had cut his hand on a can of beans because justice likes to be sly. We fed the dog a biscuit I had forgotten was in my coat. We cleaned his knuckle without making a speech about infection. We called his sister because he asked us to and he cried some more because it is easier on the phone. We did nothing that would look interesting written up by a policeman. It felt like digging a car out of sand with a teaspoon. It felt like the only thing that makes a week difference.\n\nThat night, lying on my ridiculous high bed like a man who doesn\u2019t trust floors, I said the sentence out loud to the ceiling, quietly, in case the ceiling was trying to sleep. I am here. It has become a superstition, like touching wood, like counting to five while the kettle boils. It has become a spell. The stairs in my head were quieter because the storm had found them and put seaweed on them. The guilt had a shape I could walk round rather than a fog I kept swallowing. I thought of the old man\u2019s scalp and the foolish theatre of head wounds and of my hand being useful where once it would have undone me. I thought of the dog eating a dry biscuit like grace. I thought of Dalloway and his neat hands and the way he needs us to turn our history into his casework, and I hoped for his sake he has a woman like Rena to tell him to be small when he needs telling.\n\nIt is not neat, any of it. We do not become new people because we decide to. My fear still watches me when I change a lightbulb as if it knows how much can go wrong with glass. I still cross the street sometimes to avoid a man with a ring on his hand because old warning systems don\u2019t care for updates. Sometimes I find myself looking at a knife in a kitchen and telling it what it is, out loud, so it doesn\u2019t misunderstand me. Sometimes in the supermarket I swear I can smell blood even in the aisle where they keep tinned tomatoes, which is unfair and ridiculous and how my brain says hello. But on Wednesdays I go and kneel by plastic and make the chest rise and pretend the absence of a face is a kindness. On Saturdays I watch brides insist on impossible flowers and I watch Tamsin make them bloom anyway out of paper and politics. On Sundays I sit in Rena\u2019s kitchen and eat jam that tastes more of sugar than fruit and hope she will tell me the peach story again.\n\nIn late January the foghorn started up in the corner of the evening where men on the buses start to nod against the window and teenagers begin to multiply in corners. It blew the long note that knits you into your bed. I wrote my name on a piece of paper I had been ignoring, the one from the ambulance service that said, if you want, if you can, there\u2019s a course where you might be allowed to ride along and learn how to be the person in the back who doesn\u2019t flinch. I folded it and put it in an envelope and took it to the letterbox at the end of my road where the paint is always a step behind the rust. I put it in the slot before I could decide it was a romantic gesture rather than a plan. The world did not change shape. The streetlight did not applaud. A cat went under a car with the air of someone making a formal exit from a dull party. I turned my collar up and went to the sea to see if it looked different now that I had decided a very small thing. It looked the same. It looked enormous and bored and gorgeous and indifferent. It looked like it had all the time in the world. I stood there and told it, quietly so as not to make a fool of myself, that I was here, and it did what seas do, which is ignore me completely and make me better anyway.The letter did not announce itself with trumpets. It came through the slot and sulked on the mat as if it had been told off on the way. The envelope was the obstinate brown of bureaucracy, and the logo in the corner was the same polite blue that asks you to rate your pain. I stood with toast and considered the risk of hope, which in this house sticks to the teeth. I opened it with the butter knife because the proper knife and I are on speaking terms only in good light. The words were simple, almost embarrassed: we are pleased to confirm your observer shift, Saturday night, 19:00\u201303:00, report to St. Mary\u2019s, wear sensible shoes. There was a line about confidentiality that made my chest do its own signature. There was a line about not getting in the way that felt like an old friend. There was a name at the bottom that wasn\u2019t Adam but could be someone who knows Adam\u2019s ringtone.\n\nI took it to Rena because she is my official reader of notices and doom. She put her glasses down her nose like a teacher who can make fractions feel personal. \u201cObserver,\u201d she read with relish, as if the word observed her back. \u201cSo you get to watch and breathe and not break anything? That\u2019s your calling, dear heart. You can be the wallpaper of medicine.\u201d She kissed the top of my head to bless the endeavour and told me to eat before the city ate me, which is the closest she gets to a speech. I texted Tamsin a photograph of the letter and she replied with three sirens, then a string of knives and fish until the phone looked like a kitchen drawer, then, finally, words: I am going to buy you sensible shoes you will hate.\n\nIn the afternoons the Dockyard is better behaved than it\u2019s famous for. The Warrior sits with her iron sides pretending this was always what ships looked like, and the Victory sulks under scaffolding like a celebrity getting dental work. Tamsin had conned a couple with a love of history into thinking vows taste better under a figurehead. The events office had given her a badge that would have made a lesser person unbearable, and she used it to make men with epaulettes move chairs. There is something about being beneath a ship that makes everyone stand up straighter, as if the air is full of rank. I tied ribbon round cutlery until my fingers learned the braille of it, and she negotiated a truce between the caterers and a woman whose cake wanted to be eight tiers of apology. We took a minute on the quay when the light folded itself into the water like a handkerchief and watched a ferry write its slow sentence out of harbour. \u201cRemember when we used to race the Gosport,\u201d she said, and I said, \u201cYou remember anything that lets you win,\u201d and she said, \u201cLearn from the best.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday Dalloway sent a message that had the energy of a man with a ruler. He wanted statements about the ex-tenant, the separate incident that was not separate from anything, and he wanted them yesterday, which is his favourite time. Tamsin looked at the text and sighed like a kettle with no switch. \u201cHe thinks our lives are a filing cabinet,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can have my words when I decide where they go.\u201d She asked me if I wanted to meet the woman before we put our names under Dalloway\u2019s, and I said yes because I have learned that most crisis is improved by a face. We met her at the cafe that used to be a bank and still pretends it has vaults under the muffins. Her name was Saffron because sometimes Portsmouth has a sense of humour, and she had a baby on her hip whose stare could have stripped paint. She told us about the doorway like it was a bad joke: the knock, the hand that found a shoulder instead of a wall, the apology that arrived later than the bruise. \u201cHe said he tripped on the mat,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said I startled him. The way men say you made them do it and think they\u2019ve got away with a magic trick.\u201d Tamsin was kind in the way that says, I will carry some of this and you don\u2019t get to argue. We told her we would put our names where they might do a little good and not be used for anything else. We told her about Dalloway\u2019s tie without saying his name. The baby grabbed my thumb and the scar on my hand lit up like a map. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign,\u201d Saffron said, and I said, \u201cOf what,\u201d and she said, \u201cOf someone else being present,\u201d and for once the word did not make me wish to run.\n\nSaturday came dressed as rain. St. Mary\u2019s does the kind of quiet that tastes of bleach and history. The ambulance bay had its line of green machines angled like greyhounds at a starting gate, and inside the station was the smell of tea so strong I could hear it. A wall of lockers wore names like medals. Adam appeared out of a room with a washing machine and a man\u2019s sleep got caught in his hair. He handed me a hi-vis vest that made me look like a cautionary tale and told me the rules as if he were reading me a bedtime story: don\u2019t touch needles, don\u2019t argue with drunk people unless you\u2019re bored, don\u2019t faint in the back because it frightens the driver, don\u2019t post about anything except how good the biscuits are. His partner that night was Nic, who had a ponytail that could cut you and a wit like a scalpel. She shook my hand like we had decided to be on the same team. \u201cStand where we tell you,\u201d she said, \u201cand if you start going, sit neatly.\u201d\n\nThe first hour was a list of almosts. A woman who had misread a sell-by date and convinced herself she was poisoned, a man who had noticed his heart beating and resented it, a call that was cancelled when the caller remembered this is what gin does in January. We ate crisps behind a petrol station like criminals and Nic told me the whole of a gossip that involved a wrong baby, a right dog and a funeral that had to be delayed because the vicar knew the deceased too well. The radio spoke in acronyms as if being coy might make emergencies elegant. My head adjusted its brim and tried not to anticipate red.\n\nAround eleven a cyclist introduced himself to a car door. It happens as often as people breathe badly. He was a boy with a beard as if he\u2019d borrowed it, lying in the rain with his bike considering emigration. There was blood at his eyebrow that made too big a show of it, and his knee had the kind of swelling that looks like a personality. I looked for the floor to tilt and it did not oblige me. I held the umbrella over his face and said my line, and he made the old joke about angels that even atheists know. Nic glued his eyebrow as if she were making art out of something that had gone wrong, and Adam made his knee a number and decided it could survive without hospitals if it were bribed with rest. A woman came out of a house and declared herself a nurse and told us how we were doing it wrong in the specific way of retired professionals, and Adam thanked her as if she had handed us a feather. The boy cried a little in the polite way and told me he was supposed to propose next week on Portsdown Hill at sunset, and I said, \u201cTry sunrise, you\u2019ll have it to yourself,\u201d and he looked at me as if I had invented a new joy. When we left, Adam said, \u201cThat face you do where you look like you can see the ending? Keep that. People will tell you the next part if you hold your mouth like that,\u201d and I put the compliment in my pocket and took it out again to check it was real.\n\nAfter midnight the calls changed shape. There is a point where Saturday turns into something else and the city\u2019s pulses coincide. We went to a kebab queue where a man was bleeding from the knuckles because the air had offended him, and he refused plasters as if they had a political leaning. We went to a girl on a pavement who had put into her body more than narratives and had decided to stop being awake about it, and Nic crouched and told her in a factual voice that breathing was back in fashion. We went to a house in Milton where a woman was in labour and thought she shouldn\u2019t be, not yet, not here, and Adam did the maths with his eyebrows and phoned the unit and said words like \u201cmultip\u201d and \u201cparity\u201d that made me feel I had walked into Latin class. The bedroom smelled of shampoo and heat and surrender. The baby arrived in a sound that could have been laughter or despair. There was blood, because there is always blood when life thinks it is being generous, and my tongue tasted tin and my neck remembered it could be a narrowing door, and I stepped into the hallway and counted the pores in the paint and returned with towels and an apology. The baby cried, which is to say the room remembered what lungs are for. The father tried to faint and I told him there was a queue and he laughed and didn\u2019t. On the way out Adam clapped my shoulder and said, \u201cThat one gets a blue hat,\u201d and in the back I decided to love the word hat.\n\nAt two there was a call that arrived with a weight in it. The radio did a tone nobody jokes about and said the word chest too flat to be the muscle. We were at the leisure centre car park in a minute and a half that lasted an hour. A man was on the tarmac under the sodium lights like a fallen torch. He was the kind of fifty it takes some men a war to get to. Someone had tried compressions and done their best without being told how. He was grey in the curious way that doesn\u2019t look like skin. This is where the films are wrong. There was no violins, only the sound of plastic tearing and a voice that had decided it would not cry. Adam said, \u201cOn,\u201d in a voice that peeled stickers and Nic stuck pads where pads like to live and the machine had its say. I knelt and put my hands where the woman with the hair at the community centre had told me, and the breastbone did the bend it does when you ask it for more, and I counted because numbers are the only gods that go quiet when you talk to them. The machine was kind enough to advise electricity and the man\u2019s body answered in the involuntary way that makes you feel you have asked too much. There was a smear of blood at his mouth, a small red parenthesis, and the part of my head that wants to be dramatic stepped towards the stage and I told it to sit down and stop showing off. I was the metronome. Nic breathed the air in and out with a mask that made everyone look more human. Adam watched the screen like there was a secret map on it. The siren of the second crew arrived and added another note to the anthem. It was long, and then it was suddenly not, because the time compressed when the monitor decided to stop being a flat liar and become a little mountain range. \u201cGot one,\u201d said Adam, cautious as if praise might frighten it. The man\u2019s chest decided to do the work without us. When they loaded him, his hand came up and grabbed Nic\u2019s sleeve in a full, strange gesture, as if he were pulling himself back into the world with her cloth. I sat back on my heels and realised the wet had gone through my trousers and into my bones, and I realised I was hungry, which is how you know the body has decided to stay.\n\nAt three an old man refused to let us in because he had never let anyone in after midnight in seventy years and wasn\u2019t starting now, so Adam shouted directions through a letterbox while the old man managed his own inhalers and I held the torch like a technician in a very niche theatre. By half past we were back where the kettles live and Nic had found a biscuit she had been saving for a day with this colour, and Adam put the kettle on and then turned it off because the radio told us we didn\u2019t earn tea yet. When four arrived, it did so with the thin light the city keeps in a drawer. We were released into it with the odd ceremony of people who have put off sleep for too long. Adam hugged me without making it a thing, his jacket cold and soft with the smell of other lives. \u201cYou didn\u2019t faint,\u201d he said, as if that was a joke and not a sacrament. \u201cYou didn\u2019t run. You wore that vest with dignity. Come again when you fall out with Saturdays.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday the city had been rinsed and left on the line. The streets were tired of their own reflections. I took two hours to stare at the wall and let myself have the shakes I hadn\u2019t had time for, and when my hands had finished making music on their own, I took bread to Rena and told her about hat babies without telling her about how close some men can get to not being men anymore. She made me eat eggs as if it were a legal requirement, and then she took my face in her dry hands and said, \u201cYou look steadier. You look like you leaned on something that didn\u2019t mind,\u201d and I cried for five seconds because you have to let the pressure out somewhere. Tamsin came in halfway through and pretended not to see. She sat on the edge of the table like furniture is a suggestion and I told her in an untidy way about the chest and the machine, and she went quiet in the serious way that is her truest self, and then she said, \u201cNext time I want to stand where you put your hands,\u201d as if wanting could get her a seat on the back step of the future.\n\nMonday the letter from Dalloway, stamped and severe, asked us to attend a meeting where a solicitor with a tie and a parting would try to make memory behave in bullet points. We went because we are people who complain and do the thing anyway. The room was too warm in the old way of rooms that hold their heat like grudges. The woman representing Marwick had the kind of hair that says you can\u2019t afford me, and the woman representing the ex-tenant had shoes that said she would run in them if necessary. We said the things we could stand by; that men who lean are more dangerous than men who shove because leaning is deniable; that doorways are where power collects; that the world is full of hands that think they are accidental. The solicitor tried to find the bit where we would contradict ourselves, and Tamsin smiled the way a person smiles when she knows where your rope runs out. \u201cMy name is not your evidence,\u201d she said, and the woman with the shoes smiled into her water. After, in the cold, I told Dalloway he would look better in a different blue and he laughed like a dog who has learned how to.\n\nWork returned in its coastal way: a freezer van broke at the Waverley and we had to talk a chef out of crying into langoustines; a florist phoned to say his van had been stolen and did we want the flowers anyway, he could throw them from the window; a mother of the bride had decided to wear the same colour as the bridesmaids because she liked how it made her look taller. The week had edges and they didn\u2019t bleed. On Wednesday the community centre smelled of floor cleaner and resilience and I pressed the chest of a plastic man until the world narrowed and then widened, and Adam told me my counting had improved and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s always the sevens that get me,\u201d and he said, \u201cMe too,\u201d and we looked at each other like we had known that all along.\n\nBy the second Saturday of February the starlings were free with their rehearsals and people who didn\u2019t usually look up remembered they had necks for it. The cold was kinder, the light less stingy. Tamsin got a call she took in the tiny garden she insists her flat has, and when she came back in she had a face like she had bitten into something sharp and wanted more. \u201cThey want to interview me,\u201d she said, failing to pretend disinterest. \u201cThe ambulance people. For the zero-to-hero thing. They say I could be a care assistant in six months if I promise not to shout at old men for being old. I told them I can promise to shout behind my teeth.\u201d She looked at me like someone had handed her a map to a place she\u2019d drawn in her head. I tried to be the right size of proud and managed something close. \u201cDo the uniform and the nights and the tea you forget to drink,\u201d I said. \u201cDo the whole romance. You look good in green.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t flirt with me about trousers,\u201d she said, and hugged me in the lopsided way that means she uses her left shoulder to hold herself up and borrows my right.\n\nMarwick fell silent for a blessed week and it was only later we learned that silence was the sound of a case being prepared. Arthur, from his window, shouted down gossip in bite sizes; that a judge with eyebrows that knew contempt had told Marwick to sit in a chair and listen; that the ex-tenant had an advocate with hands like she was good at tying knots; that the steps now had grit glued into their noses in case men thought they were allowed to slide. Rena said it was a miracle and I said it was paperwork, and she said those are the same thing if you live long enough.\n\nThe observer shifts became a habit of sorts. I learned the voice the radio uses when it\u2019s lying about distance. I learned which puddles on Eastern Road are deeper than they pretend. I learned what time the city\u2019s drunkest men become sweet and how to stand so a frightened child sees you before she sees her mother seeing her. There were nights without red and nights when a glass in a kitchen cut a hand and the kitchen turned into a theatre and I looked at the floorboards and described the grain. There was a call to a boy who had decided knives are for solving maths and lost the argument with his own skin. The blood was articulate in the way teenage mistakes are. I breathed and did not run, which feels like a poor boast until you can\u2019t boast it. I learned the smell of adrenaline in other people and in myself, how it tastes like pennies and old keys. I learned that some men cry when told they are not dying, and some laugh when told they might have to, and both deserve tea.\n\nThe third time the pager bossed me during a wedding, Tamsin told the registrar we were on an emergency and the registrar rolled his eyes and said, \u201cAlways,\u201d and I ran down the steps of the registry office like the world had given me a deadline. A woman had fainted in the lobby and knocked her head against the radiator in a performance my nightmares have tried to own for years. The radiator did its comic clank, the kind that says it never wanted to be involved. The cut was small and mouthy. I sat with my back against the wall and told her about the weather as if weather could sutures. I put a pad where pads go and pressed and watched the vein in her neck be steady under her skin. Tamsin fetched a plaster that had a cartoon animal on it because that is what they keep for children and adults who need lies. The woman\u2019s eye made a shape that meant she was back enough to be embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019ve always been dramatic,\u201d she said, and I said, \u201cNo, me,\u201d and we had a small contest about who had caused more trouble for strangers. When Adam arrived he brought the smell of motion with him and nodded as if he was proud in the quiet way men have built for not being caught at it. Later Tamsin told me she had found me looking directly at the colour and not folding, and I put that in the drawer in my head where I had kept all the times I had failed, and for company I left it there with this better picture.\n\nWhen Tamsin went to her interview she wore black and laughed at herself for it. She came out with a smile that was all gums and bones. \u201cThey asked me how I handle stress and I told them weddings,\u201d she said. \u201cThey asked me if I had any weaknesses and I said a tendency to speak in complete sentences, and the woman with the highlighter laughed like a drain. They said my references use words like force of nature, which I\u2019m choosing to take as flattery. They said there will be a fitness test that is mostly carrying things up stairs, and I told them stairs and I have an understanding.\u201d We went to the Common to tell the water about it and the water was busy but allowed us a look. A boy was trying to fly a kite that did not want to work and his father was pretending he had known all along this was a terrible plan, and Tamsin shouted helpful lies about angles and the wind took pity on the child and made a play for the sky.\n\nThere are things I still can\u2019t do. There are days I cannot make myself go into the aisle with the raw meat. There are mornings when the memory of the bus stop tastes like metal and I throw the duvet over my head and declare a private state of emergency. There are afternoons when a red thread on a stranger\u2019s sleeve is enough to thin the air, and I go and stand in the garden of the pub and count the holes in the fence until my lungs remember how. But there are also nights where a man\u2019s heart stops pretending and I put the heel of my hand on his other truth and do not fall. There are Wednesdays where we stand in a circle and do the counting together and each seven is a kind of prayer I have learned to say without believing in anything more than breath. There are Saturdays where a bride\u2019s grandfather falls asleep in the disabled loo and I talk him awake without making him into a joke, and he tells me about Sicily in 1944 and we both pretend the present is a small room we can exit any time.\n\nIn March, when the daffodils did their loose coins routine on roundabouts and the town forgave itself for a winter of mould, a letter came for me that did not sulk. This one had a confidence to it, the NHS crest in a mood you could have a drink with. It said there was a place on a course, a real one, the kind with whole breaths and shifts attached, an introduction to being the voice that travels with the kit. It told me the days and the hours and the rooms it would need me in. It told me there would be a uniform at the end if I didn\u2019t embarrass anyone. It told me to bring my own pen. I showed it to the kettle in case I\u2019d misread it, and the kettle clicked like a tongue and turned itself on, and I took that as endorsement. I took it to Rena who pretended to be unimpressed so she could be more impressed, and I took it to Tamsin who held the paper like it was a small animal and tried not to squeeze. \u201cLook at us,\u201d she said, \u201cbeing useful on purpose.\u201d\n\nWe went to the sea because the sea has been forced to listen to everything else. The wind had become almost polite and the gulls were out on a union break. The Spinnaker looked like a skewer for sky. We sat on the wall with chips we pretended were not supper and talked about trousers and shifts and the smell of ambulance interior in summer, and she told me she had been offered a start date that didn\u2019t make sense with weddings, and she would have to choose the sort of chaos she wanted, and I told her to choose the one that lets her sleep three hours and wake up proud rather than eight and wake up bored, and she told me I had no business sounding wise with salt on my chin. A boy ran on the stones until one of them betrayed his ankle and fell and did the thing children do where they look for permission to cry, and we both waved at his mother like satellites. We talked about Rena\u2019s knees, which had decided to be less angry because attention had been paid, and we talked about Kai\u2019s plant, which was thriving after he had stopped informing it of the news.\n\nIf there is a point to any of this, it is not one you can write on a banner and take to a march. It is in the small repetition of showing up. It is in the way the kettle permits the day with steam, and the way the gulls insist the bins are theirs, and the way the stairs remember their job if you don\u2019t let them forget. It is in the difference between a town that pretends not to need you and a town that admits it misses you when you\u2019re not on the wall where you sit to watch the water turn iron into light. It is in the phrase I am here, which is nothing and everything, which is not a saint\u2019s vow or a politician\u2019s promise, which is the sort of thing you can say to a bleeding child or a complaining drunk or a woman who has done her own heroics and wants you to notice. It is in the moments where you get to say it to yourself in a mirror above a sink that was never intended for drama and believe it a fraction longer than last time. It is in the fact that when the pager rattles its insect rattle and my body disobeys me and goes towards something red, Tamsin texts a fish and a knife and then an umbrella, and Rena sets out cups without asking, and Adam raises an eyebrow that means both courage and tea. It is, I think, in the fact that the sea ignores us and makes us better anyway, and we keep telling it our plans because we are ridiculous like that and we have to be.By the time the acceptance email turned into a timetable and a badge you could clip on without laughing, the town had remembered how to be late winter. The wind went through us instead of around us and the sun had learned to be patient in a way that looked like faith. The course lived in a building that used to be a school and now pretended to be a hospital on weekends; there were posters of lungs smiling and diagrams of hearts that looked like shame. We sat at tables that had carved names from the eighties and the tutor was a woman with hair like a helmet who said, \u201cYou will not be heroes here. You will be competent. Heroes get in the way. Competence makes it home for tea.\u201d She made us stick pads on mannequins until the mannequins looked like they were auditioning for a low-budget science fiction, and she timed our stairs like she was charging rent at each landing.\n\nI had told myself the stairs would be the test and then the stairs took that personally. Four flights in a building that had learned mildew like a second language, carrying a folded chair that knew it could humiliate you, with a stopwatch clicking like a polite gun. The first flight was joke-easy; the second thought about knees; the third tasted like pennies in my mouth; the fourth refused to be bribed. On the landing between two and three, Tamsin\u2019s face appeared in the little window because she had finished paperwork early and couldn\u2019t pretend not to watch. She did not cheer. She put her thumb up and then down and then left and then right, and I kept going because this is what you do for people who take the mick without making you small. At the top the tutor made a note that might have been You didn\u2019t die, and I stood there with my hands on my thighs and looked at the skirting board until my lungs believed me.\n\nWe learned the inventory by touch in the way of magicians, reaching into bags to pull out triangular bandages and gloves with equal solemnity. We learned to talk to radios like we respected them but did not fear them, which is a voice I have never had for men. We learned how to tell the difference between someone who couldn\u2019t breathe and someone who had forgotten how, and the tutor pursed her mouth at us until we stopped lying to ourselves about which was which. On day four a man came from fleet operations and gave us a talk about seat belts in a tone that suggested he had buried more idiots than friends, and then he told a joke that made me like him even as I promised not to be the punchline. By the end of the week my notebook looked like a page out of a drunk bird\u2019s diary and I could put a cuff on without making it into a threat.\n\nIn the evenings, the city did the honest work of putting itself away and we did the same to our bodies. I would walk back along the front because walking back along the front has always been my compromise with sanity, and the water would practice being silver while the wind negotiated with gulls over who owns the air. Tamsin would meet me with her hair up and her, \u201cWhat did you break,\u201d and I would tell her about the man who came to teach us lifting and how his spine made a sermon out of not using your back like a hero. She had her own timetable now, three days a week in green at the care home on Milton Road where the corridors are carpet and the light is a fight, and two days telling men at venues that linen is not a personality. She did nights, sometimes, and came out with her mouth thin because old men don\u2019t always want a woman to be the one who sees them small, and then she would soften the mouth for me because I am not the enemy and we would sit in Rena\u2019s and let the quiz tell us we don\u2019t know anything about rivers.\n\nRena tried falling over in February and we vetoed it at the committee stage. It wasn\u2019t one of the big falls; it was a little theatrical stumble in the kitchen that broke nothing and made everything louder. She blamed the rug; the rug blamed gravity; I blamed the lack of sandwiches between breakfast and four. I did the dance with the blood pressure cuff while pretending the cuff was just a puppet we had made for our own amusement, and she tutted as if I had bought the wrong milk. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said, approving only in the way that sounds like contempt. \u201cYou look like you know the shape of my arm. I don\u2019t love that. Bring me water you\u2019ve made important.\u201d We salted the day with small good work and she was herself before the ad break, which is the measure that matters.\n\nDalloway won a thing and behaved about it. The ex-tenant had her day in a room with air that had been filtered for people who can afford it, and the judge got to feel like a father and a guillotine. We weren\u2019t called to speak because there are lawyers who know how to make a morning out of a bruise, but we went anyway, sat at the back as if we were doing back-row church and let the words be done without us. After, on the pavement, Dalloway said, \u201cThank you,\u201d with the particular politeness of men who have discovered their use for you is not a bottomless well, and for once he did not try to collect additional truths like shells. He bought Rena a bun that she pretended not to enjoy and he put money in a charity bucket with unnecessary emphasis and I resisted telling him that money is quieter when it knows what it\u2019s for.\n\nKai moved in with the woman whose mother had the cat and found himself in arguments about spoons that thrilled him. He brought the plant to me on a Wednesday because it was dying under his affection, and I told him to stop misting it like a guilt, to leave it alone for a week and then praise it at odd intervals like a child who isn\u2019t yours. He lay on my sofa and said, \u201cDo you remember when we were sure that the problem with our lives was that nobody would let us? And now people let us and it\u2019s worse,\u201d and I made him a tea he did not drink and told him that letting is only the preface to doing. He has a way of being pleased when I sound like Rena that makes me want to become as old as the kettle on purpose.\n\nThe first big night on the back of a truck as not-nothing came with the moon pretending to be a coin you could spend. Adam had done his bemused face at the rota and Nic had already eaten three biscuits as insurance. They let me sit in the backwards chair and told me to flick the lights on my command like a child being allowed to be the DJ. We did the usuals and the not-quites and then the radio said a word in a tone I had not heard from it before. The word was stabbing and it is a stupid, small word for something that makes air leave a room. It was the kebab shop where men go to decide whether they can live with themselves, the one with the fluorescent that has seen more faces than a mirror.\n\nOn the pavement there was a boy bleeding in the way that makes sense and not sense; it had the pulse of anger rather than arteries and the sharp red of insult rather than exit. You can know this and still have your throat piss about it. The trick is to let your hands be the version of you that has always been better at being here than your head. Nic went straight in like a blade that heals and Adam did that hand-signal ballet I am learning to read, and I took the far side where the boy\u2019s eyes were and made a wall out of my body so he didn\u2019t have the shop window and his own reflection for company. \u201cLook at me,\u201d I said, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d and I said, \u201cThen look at my stupid vest and tell me why it\u2019s stupid,\u201d and he did, with competence. I described a weather front that had nothing to do with blood; I described a kettle in a kitchen that behaves when you look at it; I described a gull that I swore knew my name, and he calmed by degrees because his mouth had something to do. Tamsin arrived with a napkin she had bullied from a woman who thinks owning a mop is a personality, and she stood by my ear and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not clever but you are useful. Don\u2019t look down,\u201d and I didn\u2019t, and it didn\u2019t kill me.\n\nAfter, sitting on the step behind the shop with the smell of garlic and retreat in my clothes, I shook in the polite way that can pass for cold if you need it to. Nic shoved a biscuit in my mouth without asking because choice is not a tool in every drawer. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sit down,\u201d she said, impressed enough to let it show. \u201cOr you did it on the inside. That counts. You\u2019ll hate this job forever if you\u2019re good at it and you\u2019ll hate it more if you\u2019re not. Find a method and have it ready.\u201d Adam clinked his water bottle against mine like men briefly daring sentiment and told me a story about the first time he bled at work that ended in laughter because he knows that\u2019s how to put the idea back in its box.\n\nWhen we told Rena, she made the face she reserves for when we report danger as if it were gossip. She said, \u201cNo kebab shop in this town deserves your blood,\u201d and then she fed us fish fingers like we were eight and well-behaved. Later she made me take a tin of plasters home \u201cbecause I don\u2019t like the ones they give you; they\u2019re stingy with adhesive,\u201d which is her way of blessing a profession. There is a religion in Rena that has nothing to do with God and everything to do with cupboards. If she had a cathedral it would smell of chip fat and bravery.\n\nThe day Tamsin got her start date in green she bought the sensible shoes that were promised me and they both looked at me like I was unworthy. She made me put them on and walk up and down her hallway while she clapped as if I were a horse she was pretending to be proud of. \u201cYou look like a man who could carry a chair without making it a sonnet,\u201d she said, and then she looked at my face and softened without meaning to. \u201cYou still write the sonnet,\u201d she added, quieter. \u201cJust don\u2019t do it in the stairwell.\u201d We went to the Common because of course we did and the starlings had brought friends and the sky agreed to be half orange and half the sort of blue that makes old men remember wars they never fought in.\n\nThere are moments when the city joins in on your personal plot and you forgive it its bins. Adam phoned while we were watching the sky be complicated and told me, sounding like someone who had been volunteered, that the paper wanted to do a nothing story about community responders that would be made into something by the number of faces they could line up under a headline. \u201cDo you want your ridiculous mouth under a strapline,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cI am not a headline person,\u201d and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s why you should,\u201d and Tamsin grabbed the phone and said, \u201cHe will, if I can choose the picture,\u201d and Adam sighed like a man who knows he has lost to a principle larger than him and said Wednesday. We turned up to the photo like children told to stand still and be sincere, and the photographer made us do hands in pockets and hands out of pockets and stare off into the middle distance like we could see the future and it had given us permission. Later, the picture made me look like a person who might be helpful if you asked nicely, and Rena cut it out and put it on the fridge with the magnet that says Mind The Gap in case anyone forgot to.\n\nSpring limped into town like a man carrying a sofa by himself, and with it came the wedding season proper. The Waverley had its carpets shampooed into civility and the Dockyard hired an extra man whose sole job was to be yelled at and then admired. We did a ceremony on the pier in a wind that despised hats and the bride\u2019s veil made a play for the sea and I saw Tamsin calculate whether she could jump and be heroic without making it about her. She stayed, which felt like growth. The registrar said, \u201cDo you,\u201d and the couple said, \u201cWe do,\u201d and the sea said, \u201cI am busy,\u201d and I collected glasses with the dignity of a man who was once a poet in his head and now thinks about washing up in a way that could make him cry.\n\nOn a Tuesday, as if my life were a film that had decided to be kind, I bumped into the nurse with the eyebrows from Tamsin\u2019s bus story. It wasn\u2019t the same nurse, of course; the NHS has hundreds of women with eyebrows like anger and mercy, but this one had something of the right shape and the right age and the right contempt for people who make fusses about things that could be solved with a sandwich. She was outside the surgery having an apple like it had personally offended her. I said, \u201cDo you shout people into staying,\u201d and she said, \u201cOnly those who want to go,\u201d and I told her in a sideways way that she had an ancestor who saved someone I love by being unpleasant at the right time. She shrugged as if all she had done today was breathe, and then she told me not to hover near the bins because seagulls have learned faces and I am soft. It felt, walking away, like I had paid an overdue bill.\n\nThere was a call that was only sad. A house where the curtains were the wrong kind of drawn and a man had not woken up in the night, and there was nothing for anyone to do except make the room kinder to the dollop of living left behind. I did the voice and the tea and the find-a-chair-for-the-neighbour and the lies that are almost true. Adam did the paper and the radio and the weighing. Nic did the eyes at the door. The world had the gall to keep being itself and we packed up the smaller pieces of chaos and took them to the next address. That night, in my flat, the kettle didn\u2019t sound enough like doom to be forgiven, and I sat with my back against the cupboard and told the dark I was here and meant it less than usual and then told it again and managed more.\n\nOn the day they gave me my uniform I stood in my kitchen and laughed like an idiot. It is not flattering, the green; it makes you look like a frog that believes in health and safety. It fit me in the way new clothes fit men who have spent years in charity shop trousers, which is to say approximately. I put it on and then took it off because I had forgotten deodorant, then put it on again and caught my reflection in the little mirror over the sink and didn\u2019t hate the man looking back. Rena knocked and then came in without waiting because doors are a fad. She put her hands on my shoulders and said, \u201cLook at you,\u201d as if she had built me from leftovers. \u201cTry not to get famous. It doesn\u2019t suit our kind. You can get a small plaque on a wall one day if you insist, but not more. And bring the jacket back to me when it smells like other people\u2019s houses so I can wash it properly; I don\u2019t trust the powder you buy.\u201d\n\nWhen my first shift in green came up on the rota like a dare, the weather put on its expensive blue. Nic clapped as if we had invented the uniform and Adam cut his finger on a packet of saline and swore with admiration and then let me put a plaster on because symbol. We went out and did the honest things: a child with a marble up his nose who laughed when we made the siren noise with our mouths, a man whose dog had eaten his medication and required a lecture more than intervention, a woman who had mistaken the jitters for doom and apologised to us with cake. The radio said a word about a boat and my stomach tried to take a different bus and I ignored it. We were turned away halfway by a second crew more near, which is how the universe spares you some days.\n\nThere was a call near the Guildhall where a woman had cut her hand trying to dislodge a stubborn jar lid with a knife, which is a behaviour that should have a museum. She sat on her kitchen floor making the small moans you make when you have betrayed yourself, and the red was there, obviously, because knives like to make statements, and I felt my throat try the old trick and I breathed in the way the poster says to and I kept my eyes on the pattern of the lino in front of me. We joked about jam being a hate crime and I asked her to tell me about what she was making as if the menu could stitch her, and Nic had the dressing under control because of course she did. The woman laughed badly and then better and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the sight of my own,\u201d as if anybody did, and we made plans for the jar that did not involve metal and she promised to store rage in a different cupboard next time. Walking back to the truck, Adam bumped my shoulder with his in a way that would have knocked me down a year ago and now just set me straight. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cI wanted to,\u201d and he said, \u201cI always want to. That\u2019s the labour. The trick is to give it no choice.\u201d\n\nTamsin, in green on the days when weddings weren\u2019t paying her to decide what flowers say about a person\u2019s mother, began bringing home stories like stray cats. She told me about a woman who had called because her husband had stopped snoring for a night and she had panicked at the sudden quiet, and how they had sat and made tea and told the silence it was a blessing that didn\u2019t need to be argued with. She told me about a man who refused to let them carry him down the stairs because he said it would be a slight to his father, who had died on his feet, and how she had persuaded him to perform masculinity on the chair with such grace that he had wept on arrival for relief. She told me about a child who put a plaster on Tamsin\u2019s knee after Tamsin tripped over a toy train, very earnest, and told her the plasters work better on grown-ups because grown-ups don\u2019t heal as fast, and I watched her fall a little in love with the idea of being corrected by toddlers.\n\nOne thin morning we found Arthur in the courtyard under the new steps, intact, arguing with a woman about the proper greeting for a neighbour you do not like. He nodded at me with the proprietorial air of a man who believes he invented gravity because he lost a fight with it once. \u201cThey\u2019re better,\u201d he said, jerking his chin at the stairs, and I said, \u201cYou sound disappointed,\u201d and he said, \u201cI prefer a world with hazards; keeps the young interesting,\u201d and I did not tell him that the world will provide hazard without his curating it. He told me he had tried to imagine me in green and had failed and I said, \u201cMe too,\u201d and he laughed in a way that didn\u2019t make me want to sit down.\n\nAdam took me to the river where the ambulances rest between bad decisions and showed me a heron who spends afternoons pretending to be a stick. \u201cHe\u2019s my favourite colleague,\u201d he said. \u201cHe never radios in for back-up. He never writes a report longer than necessary. He is late to everything and nobody minds.\u201d We were quiet for a long time, watching the bird stand, and then Adam said, casually enough to be rehearsal, \u201cWhen people die on my watch, sometimes I make tea wrong for a week on purpose and let it punish me. Then I stop. That\u2019s the whole ritual. You\u2019ll need one.\u201d I told him I already had the kettle in my house trained to be a confessor and he said, \u201cGood. Don\u2019t teach it Latin. It\u2019ll get ideas.\u201d\n\nWe went to a call in a shop where a boy had cut his scalp on a corner of a shelf because he had been running away from responsibility in the shape of a manager. Head wounds perform; they always have. There was a lot of red and I felt the familiar tilt and I did my work anyway. The boy was fine, mostly hair and theatre, but the colour did the tap dance behind my eyes and I had a second where the world went down a corridor I didn\u2019t want. Nic said my name in the tone you use for men who have wandered off in supermarkets, and I came back, and I looked at the boy\u2019s shoes because shoes are for knowing people without their blood, and I told him about the time I tried to work at a fish place and my boss told me to never drop a crab because a crab bears grudges, and he laughed his own blood off his face and asked me if I was making that up and I told him I never had to make up anything with claws.\n\nThere is a peace to the end of shift that feels like theft. You step back into the station with the taste of other people\u2019s kitchens in your throat and you hang up your jacket like it has sinned. Nic took her hair down in one movement that felt like watching a kite come home and Adam washed a mug like it had tried to betray him and the radio clicked its tongue and let us go. I cycled home in the dark because bikes and I have an uneasy truce, and the Common looked like a sheet laid over the city by someone with bad folding. The foghorn did its single long note that always finds me, and I said my small superstition into my scarf like a man making weather. I am here. It\u2019s a simple sentence that keeps meeting new rooms.\n\nIn May the city pretends to be a different country for a week and we all humour it. The fronts fill with men who think shorts are politics, and the ice cream van becomes a religion, and the pier is discussed as if it will always be there. Tamsin worked a wedding on the little strip of beach near the Canoe Lake where dogs feel superior, and I held a baby with the solemnity of a judge while the mother adjusted a bodice that hated her, and the baby\u2019s eyes did the old soul trick that makes you believe in reincarnation while you\u2019re holding a biscuit. The bride\u2019s father gave a speech about how he had wanted his daughter to marry someone who would teach her to be late less, and the groom pointed at his watch with a grin that made me briefly generous towards men. After, by the bins that smell of fish and redemption, Tamsin leaned her head on my shoulder like a cat who is resting because the flight to attack will be resumed shortly. \u201cWe\u2019re building something that isn\u2019t a wall,\u201d she said, almost annoyed by her own sentiment, and I said, \u201cA jetty,\u201d and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t get maritime on me,\u201d and then she kissed me on the corner of my mouth in a way that could be explained away by both of us later, which we did not.\n\nIf chaptering is a habit, then this felt like the one where the author takes a breath and lets people make tea. Dalloway didn\u2019t call because he was busy with a sinkhole, which is not a metaphor; the Council had found itself with a literal hole and nobody wanted to own it. Kai sent me a photo of the plant surviving and his face beside it like a before and after, and I told him to stop congratulating the plant and start informing it of rent. Rena baked a traybake she refused to name and foisted half on the neighbour she sometimes loathes and sometimes loves, and I watched her invent community with pastry because that is the only way it sticks in this town. Adam cried at a stupid advert for a bank and pretended he had something in his eye, and I pretended to believe him because that is friendship.\n\nThe stairs in my head were dustier. They still arrive when I am not being careful, and the scarf is still red, and the sound is still fully itself, but the scene has been interrupted often enough now by a kettle or a pager or a woman with eyebrows that refuse death that it has lost its monopoly. When they come, I sometimes imagine Tamsin on the landing putting her hand through the glass and making faces, and in that imagining the sound is not the last word, just a note in a song I am learning to hum without being sick. It is not healing. It is not a cure. It is a practice. It is a way of letting the city\u2019s noise teach me a tune I can use elsewhere.\n\nOne night we went to the seafront for our own reasons and found the sky had decided to show off, a red that had taken anger and turned it into permission. People took photographs like they were proof, and a man proposed to a woman with a ring that the gulls approved, and three teenagers tried to get a barbecue to confess it was a bad idea and failed. We stood with chips and vinegar and the wind telling us we would regret this and didn\u2019t, and Tamsin said, \u201cI thought living was going to be a bigger thing,\u201d and I said, \u201cIt is; you\u2019re just inside it,\u201d and she put her hand in my pocket and left it there because some questions are answered by lazy anatomy. The water did its show and then went back to being itself, and that is the lesson I want for us. We can be everything for a minute and then we can be ordinary and it will not mean we are less.\n\nOn the way home we passed the steps where Arthur fell and where the tape once sagged like hope before becoming work, and there was a girl sitting halfway down, the age where the world is a mirror with fingerprints. She had her knees up and her face hidden in that way that says, leave or try, and Tamsin, who bargains with heaven without believing in it, said, \u201cTea,\u201d like a prayer. We sat three stairs down so she didn\u2019t have to look down to look at us and we listened and didn\u2019t make it about us. It was not a drama you could sell; it was a father who had used his voice badly and a mother who had used her silence worse and a school that had marks and no memory. We gave her the number for someone who answers phones without sighing and we told her she could always come and be bored at Rena\u2019s on quiz night because boredom can be a medicine, and she almost smiled, which is a currency I am learning to respect. When we left, the steps looked less like a machine for correction and more like a place to sit, which is all I ever wanted for them.\n\nIf you ask me what chapter ten is about, I might say it\u2019s the one where the shoes fit without needing to apologise. It\u2019s the one where \u201cI am here\u201d started to be true in rooms I didn\u2019t choose and the rooms did not throw me out. It\u2019s the one where Tamsin found a green that looked like audacity on her and wore it to make men be quiet in hallways. It\u2019s the one where Rena sat at her table and said grace without naming anyone and meant it with crumbs on her lip. It\u2019s the one where the city didn\u2019t soften so much as agree to coexist, and the gulls stopped being a metaphor and went back to being thieves, and the sea pretended to be impressed with us for an evening and then got on with the old work. It\u2019s the one where, at the end, I stood at my sink with the mirror that never lies and told it out loud again and heard the sentence put on a bit of weight. I am here. It still felt like an exaggeration. It also felt like a plan.",

                              "content": "The gulls in Portsmouth never shut up. They trawl the sky with beaks open and eyes like buttons, voices full of tin, loud enough to drown the ferry horns and the traffic and the banging from the shipyard that begins somewhere before dawn and doesn\u2019t end even when the sky is ink. I grew up thinking noise was a kind of weather. It presses on you here. You breathe salt and diesel and the squeal of brakes, and you spit out grit and someone else\u2019s conversation.\n\nI told myself I liked it, even when I knew I didn\u2019t. It\u2019s not that easy to leave, when you don\u2019t know what is yours besides the smell of the water and the corners of streets you learned by heart. When you have nobody to miss you if you go, the place itself digs in its claws. It pretends to be family.\n\nMost mornings I opened Templar\u2019s Fish on the Harbour with a key that stuck and a shoulder that already hurt from nothing. The awning would clatter when I tugged it down. The floor was stupidly wet even before I hosed it, because condensation dripped from the fluorescent tubes like the ceiling was sweating. There\u2019s always a sense of bodies in a fish shop. All those bodies of fish laid out with their sides parted, skin like stories, the ongoing conversation of eyes that don\u2019t look at you but you feel watched anyway.\n\nI\u2019m not good with bodies. Skin can be okay. A bruise is fine. But blood\u2014that\u2019s been tricking me for years. It started like a fainting goat trick, some party act I didn\u2019t ask for. I would be fine, and then I would see blood and be less fine. People think you fake it. People think it\u2019s something you put on. They think, especially here, where everyone stitches themselves closed with fishing line and carries on, that fear is a luxury. They don\u2019t say that. They say, \u201cGet over it, Ellis,\u201d like it\u2019s a puddle and not a trench. They say, \u201cWe all have things, mate.\u201d They pat you. Or they laugh if you topple over near the scallops.\n\n\u201cBriggs,\u201d said Mr. Hobb that Monday. He had ears that seemed to be climbing off his head. \u201cDoor.\u201d He always thought he didn\u2019t need full sentences with me, or the vowels went home early. \u201cIce comes in half an hour.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d I said. My mouth didn\u2019t feel like mine. It never did around him. He had a way of turning a person into their hands. I was hands with him: hands to lift, to rinse, to trim.\n\nIf I could have had just fish\u2014no blood, no knives, no cut fingers\u2014I would have taken that deal. I liked the weight of mackerel, that sweet heft. Their patterning like the inside of a church roof. I liked the fast work of snapping bones out with a grip and a twist you learn by watching and not by being told. But blood is not so obliging. It threads itself through the day even when you think you\u2019ll be clever and avoid it. A paper cut in the till. A nick open on the side of someone\u2019s thumb from last week that decides to say hello again at the worst possible moment. And then there was my own skin, which has always been reckless and soft, which lets in the world with too much good grace.\n\nThe ice man came, and the floor turned into a low fog when we spread the crushed snow. It filmed my boots, made them squeal. Kai came late, as he did, swinging his helmet by the strap and grinning like everything is always going to be fine because so far for him it had been. \u201cYou look pale, El,\u201d he said. He called everyone by a nickname as if we were all happily shorter.\n\n\u201cEarly,\u201d I said. \u201cNot awake yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is,\u201d he said, and then he leaned across the counter to pinch a crayfish and made it wave like he was a conjuror. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll be a zombie with the rest of us by ten, you\u2019ll catch up.\u201d\n\nWhen customers come, there are two kinds of morning. There is the morning where everything is small talk and change that makes sense and your hands stay your hands. And there is the other kind, where someone wants to tell you about their mother\u2019s gout or the way the price of sandeels is what finally convinced them the country\u2019s gone to hell. You smile, you say, \u201cYes, Mrs. Carrow,\u201d and you pretend your nails are not going numb. The numbness is warning. It says: something will show you red before you can think yourself safe.\n\nIt was a boy. Of course it was. Some boys have made themselves out of dares, like someone dared them to be alive at all and they took it too far. He was the kind with a new haircut that tried to be a decision. He leaned under the sign, he breathed fog on the glass, he pointed at the mullet like he was choosing ammunition. \u201cThat one,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mum said I should choose something oily.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood choice,\u201d said Kai, who liked to convert customers more than he liked to slice. He went to weigh it and tell the boy a price that made him glance toward the world for permission. When the boy agreed, when the notes were wet still, when the tilting of the scale made the fish\u2019s mouth gape\u2014then my knife slipped. There is nothing in the world like the sound of a blade making a decision without you. It was a syllable, a short remark, a yes that was not mine.\n\nI didn\u2019t look first. You learn not to look. I felt the sting and the little hot movement like something alive had woken in my thumb, and I thought, I will not, I will not, it\u2019s too little to count. But the brain has tricks too. You can swear you will be a person who stays on his feet and then you will be a person who is sideways, holding the counter too hard, listening to Kai laugh without malice, listening to the boy say, \u201cMate, are you all right?\u201d which is a question you can answer only with a sound. The sound I made might have been \u201cMm.\u201d It might have been the birds outside.\n\n\u201cJesus,\u201d said Hobb, like a prayer. \u201cNot again.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t on the floor but I became floor-fast; the angle of the metal shelf bit my shoulder and I thought about the way the gulls always find the most brittle edge of a day and lean there. Blood is a colour that turns loud in my head. It is water with a voice. It is thick air. When I see it on me, I become the size of a coin and I fall through the slot that life keeps ready, and out the other side is a quiet I don\u2019t want.\n\nKai had a cloth, he had something cheerful to say about last night, about the match, about the ferry that came in with all its lights out because someone forgot, which we both knew wasn\u2019t true. He held the cloth to my hand as if the colour was not the problem. He said, \u201cOver quick,\u201d and I tried to believe him. The boy took his mullet, and I could feel him take his mullet, and I could hear the door, and someone else came in, and Hobb told me with that pinch in his voice that everything I touched had turned to difficulty.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to faint in a fish shop,\u201d he said when the boy was gone and the counter was empty. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to faint anywhere, but especially not here.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cI didn\u2019t faint.\u201d My mouth went dry because we both knew I had hung on the edge and it was not respectable.\n\nHe wiped the knife on the blade of another knife, which is something he did that made no sense, like sharpening grief with more grief. \u201cIf you can\u2019t manage a nick, Briggs, you can\u2019t manage the rush. I can't be watching you like a baby, we have paying people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said, and the cloth stuck.\n\nYou\u2019d think someone might be curious enough to ask, what is it for you, the blood. You\u2019d think. Mostly they say, \u201cEveryone\u2019s had worse.\u201d Or they say, \u201cMy uncle chopped his thumb clean off and he still finished his tea.\u201d It can be true and not helpful. I tried to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not the pain. It\u2019s not even\u2014\u201d but then Hobb was called by the bell and a woman who wanted to argue about cod, and I stood still and thought about breathing like it was a brand new thing.\n\nAt nine I went for a cup from the little machine that wheezed like it was burning from within. When the lid clicked on, when the steam licked my mouth, I saw behind the counter a thin man standing like a question. People like that always know you. He wore a suit that was brave enough to be the wrong blue, and a tie that had a story I didn\u2019t care for. His shoes knew rain.\n\n\u201cEllis?\u201d he said, as if he had found me hiding and meant to be kind about it.\n\nHere is a thing: I don\u2019t have a lot of people who know me to look at me like that, with welcome that hurts. I am used to being whoever is needed for the moment. \u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I wasn\u2019t going to pretend.\n\n\u201cBeen a while,\u201d he said. He came to the edge where the glass turned and he smiled, and the smile was wrong on his face for a second, like he\u2019d borrowed it and found the fit too large. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me. No reason you would. I know your sister.\u201d\n\nI did something I do when I am not ready for a sentence. I turned the cup and turned it again and I watched the little noise in the lid where steam bursts free. \u201cI don\u2019t have\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cTamsin,\u201d he said. \u201cTamsin Keen, from Somers, back when. I\u2019m running an insurance office in North End now, wouldn\u2019t know it, right? But there is no escaping school. She said, you know Ellis, don\u2019t you? I said I knew a boy with a mouth like a question mark and a way of walking like he\u2019s apologising to the pavement. And she said, that\u2019s him.\u201d\n\nMy name in his mouth made something cold shift under my tongue. Tamsin\u2019s name did something worse. It walked into the room like someone you forgot you had locked out, and now the lock is useless. I held the counter. I told my hands to stop being hands and be wood.\n\n\u201cShe said if I saw you I should say hello,\u201d he said, watching me like he knew where the edge was and like people do when they want to go to it. \u201cAnd tell you she\u2019s got work now. She\u2019s doing\u2026 something with events. Weddings. You know, never a quiet day in that.\u201d\n\nA real person would have said, \u201cTell her hello back.\u201d A braver one would have said, \u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d but not in the flat voice that came into my throat. An even braver one would have asked him to describe her hair now, her voice, whether she still shifted her weight like standing still was a lie. I didn\u2019t ask. I said, \u201cRight. Cheers.\u201d The coffee burned my lip. I tasted that instead of all the other things.\n\nHe looked like he\u2019d come to the wrong shop and taken sugar. \u201cShe said the starlings are back on the Common. I thought you\u2019d\u2014you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway. Good to see you breathing,\u201d he said, and then he was gone, as if he had never learned to leave rooms properly.\n\nKai came back in with two men carrying a box of mussels between them, shoulders leaned to a slope. He said, \u201cYou all right?\u201d because he asks a lot of questions as jokes and then sometimes they find themselves serious.\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d I said. He let me be.\n\nAt lunch I took a packet of crisps to the loading bay and listened to the rhythm of the ships, the clank of chain on a boat that looked like a toy in a child\u2019s bath. The sky had a colour I wanted to give a name to. In school they told us poets own all the names, and the rest of us have to borrow. I didn\u2019t have money for that. The gulls were louder to punish us for the chips. I thought about Tamsin the way you think about a light in a house you don\u2019t live in anymore. She isn\u2019t my sister the way she would say she is. We share no blood, no mother\u2019s cheekbones. We shared a bathroom for three years in a house in Fratton where the doors didn\u2019t close properly and the garden was more nettles than grass and the landlord\u2019s name was Marwick but he asked you to call him M.\n\nWe shared a father because I didn\u2019t have one. I had a man who appeared late in my life and said, \u201cSon,\u201d like he\u2019d rehearsed it. Mum had been five years dead then and the state had been grumbling that I wasn\u2019t small enough for attention, that I could heat my own soup. His name was Colin Briggs and I took it because names are coats and I was cold. He lasted eighteen months, the way some lights do. He went out on the water one day and something came down and broke the horizon, and he didn\u2019t come back. In that eighteen months he brought with him a woman who knew the trick of turning a kettle into supper, and her daughter who had sharp shoulders and little patience for my quiet.\n\nTamsin. She had a laugh that was here-we-go and a way of looking over your head like there was a better conversation happening six and a half feet off the floor. You liked her and then you were sorry. That was her trick. Her mother, Rena, acted like this was the best anyone could be, bright and hard; she made tea like medicine and told me my hair needed a story and cut it herself with the kitchen scissors. After Colin didn\u2019t come back, Rena and I startled at each other for a time, then did what people do and stayed because moving takes a different kind of bravery. I paid rent to Marwick by putting cash in an envelope and not looking him in the eye. Rena cleaned the surgery on Elm Grove and brought home paper towels like a crow\u2019s hoard. Tamsin brought home boys sometimes, later girls, and once a dog that turned out to be a fox. We were nothing like a family, and we were the closest thing to one I had had in years. You can be both.\n\nI saw blood on a picture in a magazine once and hit the floor. Rena clucked and said the word therapist the way people say toothache. She made a call and then didn\u2019t make another when the numbers came back with glare on them. The first time I cut myself badly washing a pint glass at the Fawcett, there was a mess and a man with a tattoo of a bird said, \u201cHe\u2019s being dramatic,\u201d and I wasn\u2019t, but it didn\u2019t matter. I learned brakes I could use on myself; I learned to leave the room before the red got writing in it. I learned to be boring. Friends I didn\u2019t have many. People with patience for this particular failure are rare. Kai stuck because he still thought everything could be negotiated with charm and the right shoes.\n\nThere was a Sunday, years ago, when the sky had been white for days and the pavements stitched in frost. Tamsin had come back from somewhere with friends who had eyes like wolves, and they had sat on the steps and smoked and laughed like they had seen a fight and enjoyed it. She went upstairs to change her earrings and I followed because I wanted to ask her to turn the music down and because the smell of her perfume, spiky and brave, made the house feel like a place where stories might decide not to end. I have a shard of memory that shines too large\u2014her standing with a scarf around her neck, red as a Christmas apple, and saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be so poor, Ellis, it\u2019s pathetic,\u201d and me saying something I can\u2019t remember, and her laughing and pushing me like she was an older brother. Then the stairs tilted. That is as far as my head will let me. There is a wall there. If I push it, it moves in small sick inches, and then it snaps back and makes a noise like someone retching. I went to bed. When I woke, a decade had passed. That\u2019s not how time works for people who are well.\n\nWhen Hobb let me go, there was no argument. He said, \u201cWe can\u2019t keep doing this,\u201d and I said, \u201cNo.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\u2019re good with the old ducks, but I need less drama,\u201d and I said, \u201cOf course,\u201d and then he said, \u201cIt\u2019s two weeks and the time we owe you,\u201d like he couldn\u2019t keep the numbers in his teeth. I nodded. This is the part where you ask for another chance, and I was too tired to pretend I deserved one. The relief on his face was petty but useful. Everyone likes a story where they are the adult.\n\nI went home to the flat that was less a place than a series of corners I knew in the dark. I have had this one for three years, second floor, Southsea side, a view of rooftops that terraform themselves into hope when the sun is low. The carpet is brown that insists on being called something else. The window sighs. The kettle is loyal. My mother\u2019s photo is near the kettle because Rena said that\u2019s where she would want to be, nosy about tea, and I have decided to agree with women who use the word nosy as a blessing. The bed is higher than makes sense, to give the under-space a duty. The drawers stick. The bathroom is a negotiation with mildew.\n\nThe letter was under the door and had been there long enough to leave a faint crease in the thready mat. It said my name on it. The handwriting was a fight between neat and hurry. I knew the loop of the L like the tilt of the town hall. I put the kettle back on its base and my hands were damp and I felt the room step away from me in case I wanted to fall. The envelope was cheap. I opened it as if that would control the words.\n\nEllis, it said, and nothing else for a line. The lines are a story too. You can tell when someone put the pen down and thought, when they went to the window to see if the rain was ready.\n\nEllis, I saw you in the market but I wasn\u2019t ready to say it out loud. I am bad that way. Don\u2019t be cross. I\u2019m doing weddings. Can you imagine. So I can be paid to tell people what not to do, which is the job I trained for by being married to this place. Rena is\u2014well, not so well as we\u2019d pretend out loud, but she\u2019s got her soaps and her tea and her teeth in the right order. I\u2019ll come by. Or you can come to the Common at five, the starlings are a show again. We can be civil if we try. T.\n\nThe T was big and then apologised for itself with a little flick. I turned the paper and there was nothing there. Her smell had been somewhere between cigarette smoke and apple shampoo when she lived in my pockets. Here it was cheap ink, damp. I put the letter on the table and then I put the kettle on again because it seemed wrong to sit, or stand, with that and be dry. I listened to the city for a while. Someone shouted a name out the window and the name answered from two streets over, which is how it goes. The gulls edited themselves into softer. A child started crying and then restarted because his mother told him he was finished.\n\nThe fear does not care for sense. It is like hunger in that way. The letter was not red. My hands found the ghost of a cut beneath the plaster and woke it without touching. My head went to the stairs and refused to go further. It stood on top, looking down, counting the steps it was not going to take. The steps got taller, which is what fear does to stairs. My heartbeat tried on a coat that didn\u2019t fit. I said out loud, \u201cStop,\u201d because sometimes the word helps. It did not.\n\nAt four I walked to the Common because I am not brave but I know how to do the small brave thing that is leave the house when it would be easier not to. The City spread itself like it was pretending to be a painting of itself. The Spinnaker Tower did its needle trick against a sky that had found blue last minute. I walked past a dog that had the face of a judge. The people were out because light had come back and we don\u2019t waste it. The water had the mood where it thinks it is beautiful and then it is. You can sit on the wall and pretend to be sly and no one will notice if you are really just a person who doesn\u2019t know how to begin. I sat. My hands wanted to be pockets but I let them be thighs.\n\nShe stood twenty yards away like she had accidentally invented the path. This is the part where I am supposed to say, I saw her and my heart did a thing. It did, but not the thing you think. It fell into my stomach like a coin lands in a U-bend and gets stuck there to make trouble. She looked like herself in the way you do when you\u2019ve been away from a person\u2019s face and then it is again the face your mind kept secretly drawing in the margins of lists. Her hair was lighter, not honest blonde but the kind of blonde you choose to be, and shorter, and not behaving. Her jaw had made a decision. She wore trainers like she\u2019d made a truce with blisters. She had a coat that was expensive in a way you only get from being near weddings.\n\n\u201cTams,\u201d I said, and the name came out as if the air had practice.\n\n\u201cEl,\u201d she said, which hurt, and she walked and then stopped and then walked again. \u201cHello.\u201d\n\nWe did not hug. We did not shake hands. We faced the birds because it is easier to look at birds than each other. Starlings don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t manage small talk. They made their clouds and then unmade them. They spoke their script on the sky. People clapped for them without knowing they were doing it.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve been doing fish,\u201d she said, as if she needed to come in at an angle.\n\n\u201cHave been,\u201d I said. \u201cDone now.\u201d I held up my thumb as if that made sense of anything.\n\nShe gave me a look that remembered everything and chose not to use it. \u201cStill have the\u2026 thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI do.\u201d My voice was smaller than mine. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cCousin\u2019s like that,\u201d she said, though I had never known she had one. \u201cShe faints if you show her a tomato wrong.\u201d She smiled, because she had to. \u201cI, on the other hand, am blood. Me and it, we\u2019re mates.\u201d She grinned. It tried to be light. It tried to say we were both alive.\n\nI said, \u201cYou wrote.\u201d It was the only brave thing I could think of.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said. She kicked at the edge of a square of grass and the grass held. \u201cYou looked like you wanted to be left alone when I saw you at the market. Also, the man you work with looks like if you distract him, he\u2019ll eat someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s accurate,\u201d I said, and she smiled the right way this time, and I felt something in me put down a bag it had been carrying.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s Rena?\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cLike a houseplant the day before you remember to water it,\u201d she said. \u201cNot too bad. We\u2019re getting her looked at for her knees. She says the doctor is a child and she won\u2019t have a child tell her how to be seventy-one, but she\u2019ll go. She always goes. I\u2019m with her Tuesdays now.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look\u2014\u201d I began and then stopped because the words I wanted made me sound like I had been keeping a scrapbook. Different but the same. Better around the eyes. Tired in the places she\u2019d always run. She looked like she\u2019d gone somewhere and come back and pretended it was a different place. \u201cYou look the same,\u201d I said, which is what people say when they don\u2019t know what else to say.\n\n\u201cLiar,\u201d she said, gentler than I deserved. \u201cYou look thinner and older and like you\u2019re pretending not to be looking at the water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am looking at the water,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cSure.\u201d She slipped a cigarette out of a pocket and tucked it behind her ear like a joke. \u201cYou still can\u2019t do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cSay what you mean,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. Nobody in this town does. You say half a thing and assume the other person knows the other half because we all went to the same four places when we were twelve. We didn\u2019t, though. You were late.\u201d She nudged my shoe with hers and it felt like school.\n\nThe birds folded themselves into black. The light went slow orange like it had a plan. I thought about the stairs again, and the scarf, and the way air tastes in a narrow hall. I thought of a sound my brain keeps under a cloth like an unkind present. I will not lift the cloth, not here. We are being civil.\n\n\u201cDo you ever\u2014\u201d I started and stopped again. \u201cDo you ever have that thing where\u2026 you remember something and then you can\u2019t tell if you remember it or if you\u2019re making it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the time,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what remembering is.\u201d She pulled her coat tighter. \u201cSometimes I think I had a dog when I was little, and then I remember we had Mrs. Farish\u2019s dog for a week and it peed on everything I love and never came back, and my brain went, well, we tried. Also sometimes I think Mum and I lived in a house with a blue door, but really that was a mould incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think about the stairs,\u201d I said. I don\u2019t know why I said it. The birds made a shape like a river. She stilled, and the stilling was loud.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said, almost under her breath. \u201cWe said civil. We can do the other kind later. I had to work to learn how to keep tea in a cup and not throw it. I\u2019d like to hold on to that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said. We breathed. We watched the sky fold into itself. People began to go because they had children and ovens and lives. We stayed because we did not.\n\nShe said, \u201cI have to be at Gunwharf at seven. There\u2019s a couple from Havant, she wants lilies in December and he wants it to cost ten pounds. We\u2019re going to compromise and have cardboard.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you break them?\u201d I said, and then regretted it, because it was a mean joke and we used to be mean together when we thought that was power.\n\nShe looked at me with her grin that had grown up a little without asking. \u201cYou know I don\u2019t break anything. Not on purpose.\u201d She tilted her head toward the Common and the silent, thrumming thing we had made by being there, the space around us that was between people and not emptiness. \u201cYou going to be all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, which is always one of the names for no.\n\n\u201cYou really should eat,\u201d she said, which was something Rena used to ask me as if hunger was a question I had forgotten to answer. \u201cDo you want to come? I can sort something. Free food. Caterers throw things out if no one looks.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy stomach is not brave,\u201d I said. \u201cAnother time.\u201d\n\n\u201cFine,\u201d she said. She leaned in a fraction and then didn\u2019t. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it properly. We\u2019ll talk about the things we don\u2019t. I can break out the old knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I said, before I could catch it, and she blinked. I said, softer, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about knives.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. She turned away. She turned back to say something else and then let it go. \u201cOkay. Night, El.\u201d\n\n\u201cNight,\u201d I said, and watched her leave. She walked like a person who expects ground. Some people do. I pretended to be one while I watched until she was a small shape. I went the other way, toward streets that remembered me better than I liked.\n\nOn the way home I passed a group outside a pub who were arguing about the offside rule as if it were philosophy. A woman on a bike swore at a taxi and the taxi bowed. A boy, too young to be out in that jacket without someone noticing, was sitting on a low wall counting money with his head down like counting was prayer. People are not subtle here. They are brave with their faces. They are cruel with their laughter. I avoid the drink when my head is behaving like a horse that saw a plastic bag and decided it was death, but I went into the public house because I didn\u2019t want to go home and be the only voice.\n\nThe Fawcett had new paint I hated. The tables were the same, and if you leaned your hip against them, they said your name in splinters. The barmaid looked like the kind of person who used to be called girl and knows better now. She said, \u201cWhat can I do you for?\u201d on autopilot, and I asked for a lemonade and a glass of ice like I was pretending to be a soft person.\n\nA man near the window spilled ketchup on his hand, looked at it without seeing, made a joke and smeared it with a napkin. My throat tried to be clever about it; I told it to stand down. The men at the back cheered at something recorded. Kai texted me that I was a child for leaving early and that Hobb was relieved not to have to stand me up in front of the crabs like a lesson. He put four skull emojis like a threat, then a fish, then an accidental train.\n\n\u201cEllis,\u201d someone said, and there are only a handful of voices that can summon me like a stone dislodged by a boot, and one of them I hadn\u2019t heard in ten years except when I was very tired. I turned and the room changed sizes.\n\nRena had the look of someone whose body belonged to the person she was twenty and then remembered otherwise. She had a shopping bag that had lived many lives, and she wore lipstick the colour of old berries. Her knees were angry at her and she had convinced them to be polite. She said my name again, like a scold and a prayer.\n\n\u201cRena,\u201d I said, and the bar folded time for me at no charge.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing in a pub?\u201d she said, like I was a sugar lump she had caught in the flour jar. \u201cYou don\u2019t like them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here for the ambient wisdom,\u201d I said.\n\nShe snorted. \u201cYou look terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d I said.\n\nShe was never unkind in the way that makes scars; she was unkind in the way that makes you remember to eat before she sees you. She peered at my bandage. \u201cYou\u2019ve been being stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cOccupational hazard,\u201d I said. \u201cHow\u2019s your leg?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot mine anymore,\u201d she said, and laughed, and then she blinked and sat without being asked as if the chair had stood up for her. \u201cI seen Tams.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d I said.\n\nShe nodded in that way she has where her head makes the yes and her mouth says no. \u201cShe says you\u2019re going to try to be civil. I said dear God, not that, anything but nice. You were terrible at that as a boy. Like a cat in shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can pretend.\u201d\n\nShe took my hand and turned it like she was changing the channel. \u201cYou still do that thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still do that thing,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cHave you tried not,\u201d she said, and then looked ashamed of the joke, which made it sweeter. \u201cYou know I love you, dear heart,\u201d she said, and she said it like she does, like she was fixing a picture on a wall. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re carrying a football under your ribs. Put it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I lied.\n\nShe looked at the door, because she was always waiting for someone to come through it or fall through it or be dragged. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go to bingo, and you won\u2019t come because you think you\u2019re not old. Come for me, so people will think I matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to step on the sacred cows,\u201d I said. \u201cAnother time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother time soon,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, they say around the estate that Mr. Marwick fell down his own steps last week. Funny what the world will do when you\u2019re not watching it. Cracked his leg like a breadstick. Made a right noise. I heard it from the bins.\u201d\n\nI looked up. The sound of something breaking is my nightmare\u2019s favourite trick. \u201cIs he\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll mend,\u201d she said, with the sourness you keep for landlords. \u201cTamsin says she told him not to carry more boxes than sense, and then of course he did. She was there. She tried to help him and he told her to fly into the sea, like a sideways poet. The ambulance came like they remembered where we lived, and the young man in charge had a nose ring, which suggests I\u2019m a hundred. Anyway. Maybe the rent won\u2019t rise again if he realises he has bones.\u201d\n\nI thought about Tamsin and bones and a flight of steps and the way some legs make a noise when they stop being one piece. Rena drank from my glass with the sort of theft that is family. \u201cHe broke it,\u201d I said, and the picture of someone tumbling down stairs touched the picture in my head that I usually keep under the cloth, and for a second the edges matched, and the room flashed dark as hands.\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d Rena said, because she has always had to go, she has always been late because she is already on the next errand. She kissed my cheek, which is a trick of hers, and smelled of the same thing as ever: the underside of a cupboard and something like cloves. \u201cEat. Tell me you will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d I said, and she pat my face like I was a child and like she could move the bones under there with her palm, and then she was gone, taking the drone of bingo and the plastic purse and the noise of her breath with her.\n\nI don\u2019t know how to tell you about the night that wasn\u2019t now, the night the stairs and the scarf and the way the house breathed wrong. Not yet. The brain makes history a secret because it thinks it\u2019s making us safe. I went home with bread and milk and I put them on the counter like they had done a hard day\u2019s work. I sat until they seemed like furniture. Then I ate, which made Rena win a small invisible point, and I washed up, and I stood with my head against the cold glass and watched the block opposite cough up a woman in a red coat, and my skin remembered another red, softer, and my hand hurt in a way that made it not my hand.\n\nAt night, the city tells stories into the drainpipes and up through the walls. A motorbike argues. A shout comes up from the corner and runs out of breath. A siren pulls its thread through the afternoon; the thread frays and is knotted by someone else\u2019s kindness. My bed is too high. The dark had salted itself with the grey of fog, and there is a boat horn that only blows in the part of the evening where fear has its best boots on. You hear it and you think of leaving and you think of not, and both are the same weight. I fell asleep like a door with one hinge. I dreamed I was older than I could bear.\n\nIn the morning my phone had a message, short and impatient: You\u2019re up? It was Tamsin. I answered yes because it seemed I had been for months. She replied: Pick me up in twenty? And an address I didn\u2019t know and then knew, because this town doesn\u2019t let you keep that privilege. It was near the estate where the corners are the same, near Marwick\u2019s place, near the stairs and the nothing, near all the names we stopped using because they got tired.\n\nI borrowed Kai\u2019s car because he owed me, and because he wanted to be part of everything. \u201cDon\u2019t bleed in it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just cleaned the seats.\u201d He grinned. I took the keys and when I turned the ignition the car started like it wanted to be a boat. The address sat in my head and the streets unrolled to meet it in the way they do, like you made them.\n\nShe was on the curb with a bag that looked too heavy and a face that looked like she could carry it. She opened the passenger door like she owned cars now. \u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on time,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late for me,\u201d she said, which was a joke and not a joke. She put the bag in the back and then said, \u201cWe have to go to the warehouse on the industrial estate by the park. Don\u2019t fall asleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d I said, because she didn\u2019t look like she had had sleep either.\n\n\u201cHad a night,\u201d she said, and her mouth did the thing where it pretends. \u201cMarwick was being a twat. Now he\u2019s a twat with a cast.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were there,\u201d I said, careful like you handle glass.\n\n\u201cAnd you know how he is when people tell him anything,\u201d she said, and it was the Tamsin I knew, the one who can put knives in her laughter and make you cut yourself on it. \u201cHe said, I can carry these down, I\u2019m not dead. I said, don\u2019t. He said, do. The stairs said, no, thank you. Now you know the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the ambulance,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cYou can watch the tapes,\u201d she said. \u201cYou like that sort of thing. You can watch me not cry. He tried to blame me for gravity. I told him to go to hell because I am my mother\u2019s daughter. I don\u2019t think you ever liked him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never knew we were allowed not to,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cWe are now,\u201d she said. \u201cGrow up.\u201d\n\nThe car smelled like someone else\u2019s work. She switched the radio on and off and on. \u201cI might be,\u201d she said. \u201cI might be doing something new and something foolish.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always are,\u201d I said. The road let us pass and the water did that thing where it puts metal in your nose. We turned where the bed shops begin to fight with the furniture stores, where there are boxes on boxes and the whole of it looks like someone\u2019s life mid-sorting. I looked at her hands on her lap and thought, I know those hands. I know their map. There is a scar on her right index where the fox that was a dog taught her about hunger. There is a whitened line on her wrist where she fell off the bike she stole from me in the April of the year we were terrible.\n\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d I said, and she looked at me like I had picked up a stone that belonged to both of us.\n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCarrying other people,\u201d I said. \u201cWeddings. Lifting boxes. Doing the being brave. Does it hurt or does it help.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth,\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t that the way of it.\u201d\n\nAnd then, before the warehouse, before the strong coffee, before the boxes of vases that look new but aren\u2019t, before the woman in the office with the nice eyebrows and the anger, there was the sound. It came from the right, from the estate. It sounded like a bone giving up. Like a piece of furniture turning into words. She went still in the seat like she had learned that stillness is a language. I turned the car without thinking where the road would allow, and we were there in front of Marwick\u2019s building which is not anyone\u2019s name for it but we lend landlords our words.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs was a man whose face had decided this wasn\u2019t a day he owned. He wasn\u2019t Marwick. He was the one who borrows a ladder and doesn\u2019t return it. He had his hand on his shin and his shin was making angles that do not belong to shins. I looked, by accident, once. That is all it took. The world went into a narrow tube and the tube was a colour I don\u2019t like, and my throat said, here we are again, and my hands said, we will be unhelpful now. The man swore, in ways I admired, and Tamsin said, \u201cYou stupid bastard,\u201d and she ran to him and ran with a steadiness that is not mine.\n\nShe did not go gentle. She took my belt and put it round the man\u2019s calf above where the wrongness was blooming, and she did it like she had spied on training and kept the notes. \u201cYou are not going to die,\u201d she told the man. \u201cYou are not even going to get to enjoy morphine, because you do not deserve joy. I told you not to lug those options down by yourself.\u201d She had her phone with the emergency line in it and she spoke into it like she was giving the orders to a kitchen.\n\nI saw the belt, I saw the skin, I saw the shape of a leg that was now many legs. The air filled with the river sound that comes when my head has had enough. I held the metal railing and my knuckles tried to pretend they were bone. I could taste the side of a penny. A small part of me walked away and stood on the grass and explained to nobody that it was Sunday and that this was not right.\n\n\u201cEllis,\u201d said Tamsin without looking at me. She knows the chemical names of the storms in my blood. \u201cSit down. Put your head between your knees. You\u2019re no use upright. You\u2019re no use at all, but I do love you.\u201d\n\nI sat. The concrete had an opinion about my trousers. The man groaned and made noises that were not words and were not the wrong kind of quiet either. An old woman in a dressing gown flapped on the landing and gave me a stick of peppermint for no reason I could name. When the ambulance came, quicker than it does on television, the man who got out had a nose ring. Rena never lies. The woman with him had eyes that had seen every kind of night. Tamsin briefed them like she had employed them. The man with the nose ring looked at me just once and then stopped seeing me because I was background furniture like a cactus. It was a relief.\n\n\u201cNice job,\u201d said the woman with the eyes, to Tamsin, which made Tamsin stand taller for a second and then pretend to stoop. \u201cYou in the trade?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Tamsin said, and if ever a sentence had the feel of prophecy it was later, and I could not know it then.\n\nThey splinted the man. They did the things with straps that I cannot watch on television without walking out. They did not make more red in the world. They were kind the way people are when the kindness will cost them nothing. The man said his name was Arthur like that would help. The old woman cried as if she was practicing for something worse. When the lift of the stretcher made Tamsin put her hand to her face for the first time since it began, she did it with the back of her wrist, quick, a child.\n\nAfter they left, after the little round of nothing that follows, the courtyard looked like a stage that had forgotten its plot. Tamsin lit the cigarette she\u2019d been keeping and then didn\u2019t smoke it. She looked at me like I might make a joke for her, and I didn\u2019t. She said, \u201cSee? I told you. Gravity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou okay,\u201d I said, as if I had a right.\n\n\u201cMe? I am the picture of health,\u201d she said. \u201cYou, on the other hand, look like someone wrung you out.\u201d She touched my shoulder. \u201cWhy do you keep doing this to yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t choose it,\u201d I said, and the wind stood up between us like it had something to say. \u201cDo you remember\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, and I shut my mouth because she had put the word up like a wall and painted it with a threat. \u201cDon\u2019t, Ellis. Not yet. You\u2019ve always had a way of opening things that need to sit shut. We can do that in a room, with biscuits, when I\u2019ve slept.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d I said, and I placed the word obedient on my tongue and let it dissolve.\n\nWe went to the warehouse like it was what normal people do after a man\u2019s leg decided to be two. The day kept going, because it does, because nobody asked if we were okay with that. The boxes were heavy. The woman with the eyebrows admired a set of plates as if money were an emotion. Tamsin told her a schedule and I watched her build a day out of sentences in a way that made my chest ache. I thought about a piece of paper and a scarf and stairs and breath and the way your brain tells you something and then takes it back. Did I say I killed her? Not aloud. Not yet. The word killed is not a light word where we are. It hangs around your neck like a job.\n\nWhen I took her back to the address, the steps were clean now, which was a miracle I understood. She said, \u201cSame again tomorrow,\u201d and I said yes because I am a yes person until I am not. She leaned into the car, her face inside the window but her feet still on the world, and she said, very soft and very ordinary, like it was what we do, \u201cYou know I should be dead,\u201d and then she shut the door with my answer still in my throat and went up the stairs with the kind of speed that comes from not wanting to hear the response.\n\nI drove to the sea with the windows cracked and the radio chewing old songs. The gulls had a committee meeting and didn\u2019t invite me. The tide put its tongue out at the wall. When I closed my eyes, the sound of bone turning itself into sticks played and played like a song stuck on, even though I hadn\u2019t seen the worst of it. You can smell pain in the air; it\u2019s not a lie people tell to make themselves feel interesting. It smells like the last cupboard in the kitchen you didn\u2019t open. It smells like pennies.\n\nI slept badly and dreamed worse. When I woke, there was a taste in my mouth that had a time attached to it: ten years exactly, or nine and some change, a New Year with the cheap rockets going off over the Common, a night the frost drew patterns on the cars like white flowers that don\u2019t live. I could not help it. The cloth lifted. The stairs came. The scarf. Her laugh like a knife you intend for bread. The push that can be a joke until it isn\u2019t. The sound a body makes when it meets the hard. The sound that is not someone else\u2019s bone, not Arthur\u2019s, not Marwick\u2019s. The sound that is the shape of guilt. It was me. My hands. My clumsy and my anger and my inability to be anyone else. I had not known how to carry anything. I had made myself into a person who drops things when he sees red because once I dropped someone.\n\nAnd then, like the tide taking pity, the memory took itself back again and left me with only the after-taste and the sweat. My hands were my hands again. Somebody was shouting outside in a voice that belongs to bins. My kettle changed the subject with its thin scream. I stood there in the small kitchen and watched water become more itself and thought, I am not safe from the past, but maybe I can be stubborn in the present. Maybe I can bunk off my own head for a day or two.\n\nI texted Tamsin: Tea? That was all. The word had worked for us before. The word might be a boat.\n\nShe sent back: After work. Big day. The sort where I break things. And a kiss that I could pretend meant nothing.\n\nI turned the tap and let the water run until it stopped smelling of pipes. The city outside was already arguing with its own noises and I had another day to go and be a person who doesn\u2019t faint and do a job I might not keep and love people I maybe can\u2019t afford. The fear was awake. The memory was not fully. The gulls began again. The day stood up.\n\nIn the mirror over the sink I made my face say, we carry on. It doesn\u2019t look like me when I do it. That was fine. I didn\u2019t need to be me to survive. I only needed to be someone who could wait in the noise until the next piece of the story arrived.",

The sky was a lid and the gulls were already arguing with the bins like they were owed an apology by plastic. I told myself I would go, I would stand in the steam of ice and bleach for ten minutes, I would say thank you to a man who thinks saying less is a leadership style, and then I would leave without knocking over anything that cuts. The bell above the door rattled like loose teeth and the cold air inside carried the comfort of wrong choices you know by heart. Hobb was at the back with the books, licking his finger as if money needs tasting. He glanced up and did a whole conversation with his eyebrows about how long I had taken, then remembered I was doing him a favour by existing only briefly.\n\nHe slid an envelope across like it might explode if he made a bigger movement. It had the weight of Thursdays and the lightness of all the other days. Kai leaned his elbows on the counter and made a face that wanted to be sympathetic and ended up being sunny because that is his only coat. \u201cYou all right?\u201d he said, as if we had had a different week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d I said, and the word did what it always does, stood in for a yes and hid a no like a coin in a shoe. \u201cYou still a man who lends cars?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man who collects favours like bottle caps,\u201d he said, grinning. \u201cYou still going to marry the sea if no one stops you? Watch yourself, she bites.\u201d He slid me my last bacon roll on the house like he was commemorating something, and for a second we were boys and then we weren\u2019t.\n\nHobb cleared his throat as if a small bird had got stuck in the pipes. \u201cAnd the key,\u201d he said, picking at a ledger corner with a nail that looked like it had been cut with anger. \u201cAnd your apron. And if you could resist writing a poem about it all over the internet, that\u2019d be grand.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the internet,\u201d I said, and it was almost true, and it made Kai snort into his sleeve. The key went heavy into his palm like the end of a story you\u2019ve been reading and pretending you don\u2019t mind the last page. I wanted to say something like sorry, like thank you, like I am not as useless as I look, but those sentences require a spine I couldn\u2019t find this morning, so I said, \u201cGood luck for Christmas,\u201d and turned into the air.\n\nOutside the day was trying to be a bright thing and succeeding for the rich. Mrs. Carrow walked past with her bag-for-life that had given up and become a bag-for-now, and she said, \u201cEllis,\u201d in a way that told me she had a list of gripes ready for whoever had hands. I nodded and dodged on instinct, and then I nearly walked into the thin man in the brave blue suit. He had the expression of a person who knows what he looks like in a reflection and prefers it to reality.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he said, the word warm and watchful. \u201cWe keep bumping.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t,\u201d I said, then softened because his tie had tried so hard and failed. \u201cWhat do you want me for?\u201d The envelope in my pocket trembled like a small animal.\n\n\u201cWitness statements,\u201d he said, and I hated that the shape of his mouth could make the shape of trouble so polite. \u201cAbout Mr. Marwick\u2019s little flight. Liability, see. The Council like to pretend steps are no one\u2019s responsibility until a man\u2019s leg reminds them of gravity. I\u2019ve got a form that says you can put your name down as a person who saw. And your\u2026 friend\u2014Miss Keen\u2014she\u2019ll need to talk to me too. Off the record, of course. Nothing to worry yourself with. I\u2019m just collecting truths, the way the sea collects glass.\u201d\n\nThe word friend stuck in my ear and made itself a bed. I wanted to tell him that truths are not bottle caps and people are not shelves, but then I remembered that he knew Tamsin from school and probably believed that knowing was the same as owning. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything until it was already a mess,\u201d I said, careful with the edges. \u201cThe ambulance saw more than I did.\u201d\n\nHe nodded like he knew how memory works and had watched it crumble in good light. \u201cAlways the way. Look, don\u2019t be a stranger. I\u2019m with Dalloway & Sons on the corner. We do the grim things so other people can keep their hands clean. Tell Tamsin I asked after her. She\u2019s a firework, that one.\u201d He smiled his poor borrowed smile and drifted away, leaving the smell of aftershave that wanted to be a yacht.\n\nI took the long route back along the water, because the water will have me even when people won\u2019t. The ferries made their slow declarations out of harbour, and I watched them the way men watch each other\u2019s shoulders in a bar fight. There is a lesson in the way something huge can move with that much grace if you stop insisting on going where streets tell you. I considered the number for the GP pinned to the cork board by the kettle at home, a paper that had been there so long even the drawing pin had a groove. The last time I called, the receptionist had a voice that thought I might be making sickness up for attention, and I had hung up before she could offer me an appointment in March. I rehearsed it again: hello, a problem with blood, vasovagal, yes I know the word, no I don\u2019t want to waste your time, yes I am doing the breathing, no I am not getting better and if anything I am turning into a man-shaped faint. The seagulls heckled like old men against benches. A child licked a lamppost to see if it would freeze his tongue, and his sister watched like a scientist. The world stays stupid, which is sometimes a blessing.\n\nAt midday, with a heat that wasn\u2019t really heat under the pale sun, I took Rena to the GP because she has a particular way of losing appointments unless someone stands at her elbow and reminds her she is loved. She hates lifts because they do their work while looking smug, so we took the stairs and she swore at each one as if naming them was going to make them fall out with their own legs. The waiting room was full of the particular variety of chairs that punish you for sitting wrong. A man coughed as if he wanted to expel his own past. A poster about bowel cancer had a cartoon intestine on it with eyes, and Rena tutted and said, \u201cNot everything needs a face.\u201d\n\nShe pinched my cheek the way you pinch dough to see if it will rise and then peered at me in the brighter light from the window. \u201cYou look like you slept in a sentence,\u201d she said. \u201cNot even a good one. You should put your name on the list. Talk to a person in a cardigan about how your head likes to play dead. It\u2019s free unless you want it to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I said, watching a nurse who was too young to carry that much tired. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said, and she was both wrong and my mother. \u201cYour man with the nose ring saved Arthur, by the way. He came back later with forms and a smile and you know I don\u2019t trust a smile on a Tuesday, but I trusted that one. He told me there\u2019s a course you can do, to learn to do the holding and the pressing without making more of a mess. Community responders. Looks good on a CV, he said, as if mine isn\u2019t already an opera. I told him I was too old, and he said people don\u2019t stop bleeding just because you\u2019re seventy-one.\u201d\n\nRena has a way of giving me my next hour without asking if it fits. I filed the words away under maybe, like you do for chores you suspect might save your life. A woman with a baby sat down opposite and the baby stared at me with the rudeness of the new. I pulled a face and the baby solemnly pulled one back, and for a moment I felt exactly the right size for the room. Rena nodded to herself because she likes me better when children don\u2019t cry.\n\nWe got her seen and we got her prescriptions and we got out before the walls could start swapping names, and I took her home to her flat where the carpets smell of boiled cabbage even on days no one has seen a cabbage for months. She showed me the plant she\u2019s keeping alive by arguing with it and told me to go and be in the world and not supervise her, because she didn\u2019t need me to watch her make a sandwich as if the bread might leave. \u201cSix,\u201d she said as I went, a number without a noun attached. \u201cYou coming to mine to watch the quiz and shout the answers like a smug parrot. I bought a cake that tastes of lemon if lemon was poor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d I said, and she kissed the side of my head as if I had earned it.\n\nTamsin sent me a voice note at two. She does that because texts make her impatient and calls make her feel like she is performing. It had the sound of wind and feet and her breath doing that fast thing that is not quite panic and not quite joy. \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing anything except staring at water and bothering old ladies, I need a pair of hands at the Waverley. The couple have decided the chair bows are the wrong white and I need someone to pretend to be useful while I murder a ribbon supplier with my mind. Also you can carry boxes. There might be canap\u00e9s in it for you. And you owe me one for not letting you lick the pavement at Arthur\u2019s. Twenty minutes.\u201d\n\nThe Waverley is a hotel that acts like it could be in a better city. It does its best. Its lobby has a carpet you could get lost in and a piano that has forgotten what a tune is, and the staff glide like they took ballet once and decided to keep the posture. I found Tamsin near a pyramid of champagne coupes that looked like a dare. She wore a shirt that made her look like she knew where the exits were and her hair in a knot like a sailor. She saw me and did a version of a wave that seemed to think waves were for other people.\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d she said, handing me a crate that was heavier than it looked. \u201cUpstairs. Don\u2019t look at the bride unless she talks to you. Don\u2019t tell anyone your last job. Don\u2019t faint. If you do, do it somewhere photogenic.\u201d She took three boxes herself and walked with that easy authority of someone who has just decided she knows what she\u2019s doing and hopes no one argues before the decision settles.\n\nThe function room was all white around the edges, as if someone had erased its history, and in the middle was a mess that only money can make. Flowers lay everywhere like wounded. Men in narrow trousers argued about chair placement as if chairs are political. The bride stood with a look I have seen on men in court, a look that says the day is too large and too delicate at the same time. Tamsin marched past it all, issuing calm, pretending that control is a substance you can hand out by the ounce. I followed, relegated to a moving backdrop, which is my comfort.\n\nWe tied sashes, which is a work of theology in this town; people will go to war over a bow. We laid cutlery in a way that pretends knives have never done harm. We faked an ease that must have looked convincing because the bride eventually unclenched enough to cry and laugh in one movement and asked if she was a terrible person, which is the thing all brides ask when they have spent the morning commanding chandeliers. Tamsin did her voice like balm and told her she was a perfect monster, which is to say perfect, and the woman laughed in relief and went to be painted again.\n\nIt was going to be almost fine, and then the groom\u2019s uncle cut his finger on a box of wine because justice likes to play small jokes. It was nothing as far as the body is concerned, a nick where a flap of skin looks like it wants to be dramatic and then thinks better of it. For me it was a note from a song I try not to remember. He held up his hand to the light like he was auditioning for a saint, and for a second the red said hello in the middle of the white, and the room narrowed to a tunnel that made the hotel into a ship. I felt my neck go cold and my fingers lose the plot. The glass stem in my palm felt like a throat.\n\n\u201cEllis,\u201d said Tamsin, without looking, as if we had rehearsed this in secret. Her voice pressed a hand to the back of my head and pushed my gaze away from the colour. \u201cString lights. The ones in the crate. Behind you, left. Go be clever with electricity.\u201d She was already moving toward the uncle, already having a plaster appear out of air, already commandeering a waiter\u2019s black napkin as a bandage and a prop. Her hands did the thing hands do when they\u2019ve seen worse and made it better. I turned and walked like I had been told how, and the string lights were a patient animal who didn\u2019t know where its head was. I breathed the way the internet says you should, in on four, out on six, pretending to blow on a match. The world un-tunneled. The uncle made a joke about being a martyr and declared himself in love with Tamsin and his wife did not argue because some loves are only allowed for emergencies.\n\nAfter the ceremony, which happened with the right amount of tears and none of the wrong, we stood by the kitchen door and ate the offcuts of vol-au-vents like stray dogs. Tamsin chewed and leaned her head on the wall, closing her eyes in that way that means she is checking something inside is still there. \u201cI like this part,\u201d she said. \u201cThis feeling like you\u2019ve [held] everything together with string and gum and then no one sees the string. It\u2019s like\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like when you used to balance on the wall by the little park and I would hold my hand a centimetre from your back and you\u2019d swear you could feel it even if I wasn\u2019t touching. That.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could have been a surgeon,\u201d I said, watching a chef swear in French to a pan that was definitely English. \u201cOr a general. Or God.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo much paperwork,\u201d she said, and then, with her mouth full, \u201cDo you know I wrote to the ambulance place. The nose ring man\u2014Adam\u2014told me they do those courses. He said if you\u2019re good at bossing people kindly and you don\u2019t mind lifting weird things at three in the morning, you can be one of them. I said I mind blood and he said everyone does until they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love blood,\u201d I said, and she made a face as if she was the one with the phobia.\n\n\u201cI love being the person who decides what it means,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the same thing. Weddings are all triage when you think about it. Only with lace.\u201d She licked pastry off her thumb and saw me look and hid her hand like a trick. \u201cYou could do it,\u201d she said, and I laughed, because she is funny.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want someone who keels over at the sight of a raspberry,\u201d I said. \u201cI could drive the ambulances and vomit out the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou underestimate how much they need drivers,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd how brave it is to be the person who holds the door open without fainting in it.\u201d Her face went strange for a second, soft and wicked at once. \u201cAlso. You have a nice voice on the phone. You could talk a man out of dying just by telling him about the weather.\u201d\n\nIn the lull between speeches and dancing, in that awkward hour where the men who eat too fast take off their ties and the bridesmaids discover their shoes are not loyal, Tamsin dragged me into a side corridor that smelled of bleach and hotel secrets. The lights hummed. She pushed a door that said Staff and we went into a room full of folded tablecloths that looked like sleeping ghosts. She shut the door with her heel and leaned on it, looking at me like she had walked a long way with a question on her head.\n\n\u201cDo you remember the scarf,\u201d she said, and she said it as if the word had a wire in it.\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I said, though the truth is I remember it like you remember a dream someone else told you. \u201cRed. You said I looked poor in it.\u201d The room tilted almost invisibly. I felt the part of my brain that keeps the cloth begin to fidget.\n\n\u201cI said you were poor,\u201d she said, and her smile fought with itself until it lost. \u201cWhich was true, but I meant mean. I meant mean like withholding. I was horrible. I was being the person I thought I had to be to not be eaten. You looked at me like a dog looks at a hand with rings on it.\u201d She rubbed at the scar on her wrist like she was polishing a memory. \u201cI keep thinking if I start it, if I pick up one thread, then the rest will come and we\u2019ll know if we\u2019re supposed to hate each other or just buy a cake.\u201d\n\n\u201cCake is cheaper,\u201d I said, and then the atmosphere in the cupboard of linens strangled my joke for me. \u201cI think I pushed you,\u201d I said, because I am the man who fills silences with knives. \u201cOr I think I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m choosing the story where I did because it gives me someone to punish. I remember the stairs and I remember the sound and I remember your laugh like a blade and that scarf and then I remember nothing until years had passed and you were not dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot dead is one of my better tricks,\u201d she said, and the corner of her mouth lifted with old spite. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that. It was later. It was\u2026 no, not here. Not with confetti like dandruff outside this door. It was not you, and also I am not letting you off that easy. You were a bastard that winter. You were so careful with your kindness that I thought you had none. You wanted me to deserve your attention, like a prize. I was used to a different kind of cruelty. Yours was new. You know this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was nineteen,\u201d I said, like it was an excuse, and she snorted.\n\n\u201cWe were all nineteen,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of us made it to twenty without pretending to be statues.\u201d She reached and touched my face with two fingers, quick as if she was turning off a radio. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill me,\u201d she said, and it was the simplest sentence in the room. \u201cYou didn\u2019t. You might have wanted to for a second because I was unbearable, but you didn\u2019t. I am alive by accident and stubbornness and a nurse who yelled at me, and that\u2019s a story for a bus stop, not a hotel. Get out of the cupboard before I make out with you because the place where fabric is folded is our ancestral home.\u201d\n\nWe went back to the noise, and I carried plates and watched her keep people from discovering disappointment. The band played Brown Eyed Girl because things like that must be endured, and the father of the bride cried into his own pocket because all men are five when it comes to letting go. We finished at eleven and slid through the service entrance like thieves, and the night outside had a texture like breath on skin. She leaned against the brick, letting the cold steal the heat from her back, and lit the cigarette she had been storing behind her ear since the Common. She didn\u2019t smoke it. She just watched it burn and go out and held it like a wand that could make the day stop if she shook it hard enough.\n\nWe went to Rena\u2019s like children, because she said six and it was nine and she\u2019d pretend to be cross and then put a piece of lemon cake in our hands regardless. Her flat was warm as turnips and crowded with the kind of rubbish only love keeps. The quiz shouted and the kettle did its war cry and Rena said, \u201cYou got thinner and prettier and I don\u2019t like either,\u201d and then kissed us both as if we were her idea. We sat on her rug and ate cake that tasted like it wanted to be forgiven. Rena asked how many bones are in the ear as if we were in a bet, and Tamsin made up numbers with the authority of a minister.\n\nIn the adverts, a voice chirped about washing away blood in a way that made both Rena and me swear in stereo. Rena muted it by hitting the remote like a rat. \u201cDid I ever tell you about the time your mum cut her thumb trying to be a hero with a tin of peaches,\u201d she said, and I said yes because she tells this one in winter. \u201cShe bled like it was a show and then laughed because she\u2019d made a mess on my new towel, and then she went white and fell down like a girl in a Victorian novel. Only time I ever seen her do it. She said, I\u2019ve been waiting years to get away with fainting. She said, don\u2019t be greedy with your drama, Rena. I told her I\u2019d be greedy for both of us. God, I miss that cow.\u201d\n\nWe did not look directly at sadness. We watched it from the side like a train. Tamsin had a way of holding her mug that made me think she had been holding something hot for a long time and her skin had adapted. She put her head on Rena\u2019s shoulder and Rena rolled her eyes because she thinks affection is a trick, but she didn\u2019t move away. \u201cThere\u2019s a man,\u201d Rena said into Tamsin\u2019s hair, without preamble or permission. \u201cHe works at the docks. He came round asking after you. I said who wants to know and he said a man with paperwork, which is not a name. I told him to go to church. He\u2019s got that look like he could sell you a sofa, only the sofa would belong to someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsurance,\u201d I said, and both women winced like I had said dentist. \u201cFor the steps. He wants witnesses with neat pens. He thinks the truth is tidy if you put it in boxes.\u201d\n\nTamsin made a face that said she could take a box and make it a hat. \u201cWe can give him what he needs and not what he wants,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m good at that. I have a degree in it. He can ask me what I saw, and I will say, I saw a man think he was bigger than friction. I saw a town that needs new stairs. I saw myself tell him no and be ignored. I did not see God.\u201d\n\nWhen I walked home, the night had put fog on and the lamplight made cones like a cheap show. My flat was there like it had been every day I was missing, and on the mat was a leaflet Rena had pushed under earlier when she wasn\u2019t pretending to have respect for boundaries. It said NHS in a polite blue and had a photo of a woman listening to a man as if he was more interesting than anyone else had ever been, and the headline said Talking Helps in a tone that could make a grown man cry. There were numbers. There were promises. There was the suggestion that you should not have to pay to be told you\u2019re not mad.\n\nI put it in the drawer where elastic bands go to die and then I took it back out because I have learned that ignoring paper does not make paper less sharp. The kettle shrieked and I let it. The flat breathed in its creaks. Somewhere a car alarm declared war on nobody. I gave myself the small obedience of filling in a form. It asked me to rate my sadness from one to ten like sadness is a service. It asked if I had thoughts that were unkind to myself and I ticked a box as if that could make a difference to the way my heart does its work. It told me someone would call within two weeks and I thought two weeks is a way to describe forever.\n\nSleep came in chapters and left between them. I woke to a message from Adam, the nose ring paramedic, because Rena is a woman who can get numbers out of anybody without paying. He wrote like a person who has no time to fuss and some time to care. There\u2019s a community responder training on Wednesday at the community centre by the lido, his message said. No blood. Just maps and pads and how to talk to people\u2019s fear. You\u2019d be good at the talking. Bring someone who likes to argue with chairs if you want. He put a smiley and then killed it with a full stop.\n\nI stared at the line about no blood until it felt like a dare. I screenshotted it and sent it to Tamsin with a question mark like a teenager. She sent back a thumbs up and then, after a beat, a second thumbs up because she has never known when to leave well enough alone. I put the phone down on the counter and watched it glow like a small, smug fish.\n\nThe day did what days do; it arrived whether I wanted it or not. I went to the harbour and I let the cold make my fingers ache into their own shapes. I watched a ship come in looking like a cardboard cut-out until it got close enough to have teeth. A boy kicked a ball against a wall that did not care and I wanted to tell him to kick a different way but then I thought perhaps he would find it for himself and resent me less. My feet took me toward North End without asking if that was clever, and I found myself standing outside Dalloway & Sons looking at a cardboard accident in the window. The poster had a man lying under an oversimplified car, smiling because that makes it all right, and under him the words said We Make It Easier To Heal, which is a lie and also what you want to hear.\n\nInside, the man in the wrong blue suit looked up and his face lit like a shop train set. \u201cEllis,\u201d he said, as if we were children who had met at the swings. \u201cYou came in of your own free will. That\u2019s rare and therefore valuable.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came to tell you to leave Rena alone,\u201d I said, because I had misjudged my own courage and now I had words and nowhere to put them. \u201cAnd to take my name off whatever list you have that says I saw anything useful. I didn\u2019t. I saw a man on a floor decide to become a problem and then got told to sit down by a woman who has earned the right to say that forever. Write that on your form.\u201d\n\nHe folded his hands and looked like a person who prides himself on not blinking. \u201cI grew up in a town where if you didn\u2019t tell the truth early, someone else told it for you,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not the bad man here, Ellis. I\u2019m trying to get the Council to look at what it has been ignoring since the eighties. It helps my client and it helps your mother and it helps the old woman in the housecoat who thinks peppermint fixes legs. If I have a letter with three names on it, the stairs might get fixed and you might not have to watch another shin try to make a right angle. Help me put a weight on the scale.\u201d\n\nHe had put the word mother in his mouth like a match and blown on it. I wanted to lift a chair and throw it at his soft face and then I wanted to go home and put my head under the pillow until there were no stairs left. \u201cRena isn\u2019t my mother,\u201d I said, and then because that sounded like betrayal I added, \u201cShe is. She\u2019s the kind that counts. And if those steps get fixed because you got signatures, I\u2019ll sign. But you don\u2019t go to her flat like you want tea. You send a letter like a person who knows doors are ladders.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, slowly, and for a second the wrong blue suit looked right on him because he had remembered he was a person inside it. \u201cI\u2019ll send letters,\u201d he said. \u201cBring Miss Keen to the training if you can. The paramedics like converts. And tell her I still think she should have been captain of the netball team even if she didn\u2019t go to practice.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to hell,\u201d I said, kindly, and he laughed in a way that made me consider not hating him for five minutes.\n\nOn Wednesday, we went to the community centre with its smell of old chlorine and biscuits. The room had a dozen chairs and a line of mannequins without faces lying on the floor like a quiet crime. A woman with hair like authority stood at the front and talked about how hearts lie and lungs want persuading and how fear is a thing you can talk to as if it\u2019s a badly behaved dog. Adam stood at the back with his arms folded and his nose ring making a small, defiant star, and he nodded at me like we had saved a life between us which is generous.\n\nWe learned where to put our hands without breaking ribs and how to count without the numbers running away. We learned to peel the back off sticky pads with more confidence than I thought I had left. We learned to say \u201cI am here\u201d in a tone that does not make things worse. Tamsin rolled her eyes at all of it and then executed compressions with a seriousness that made the room take a breath, as if it had been waiting for someone to treat the plastic like a person. When it was my turn, the fake chest was cold and my arms shook and my mind tried to go to the red place and I made it stay. Adam crouched next to me and said, \u201cYou\u2019re doing it. Don\u2019t think about whether you can. You are,\u201d and it was the kind of sentence that might have saved me at sixteen if anyone had thought to say it.\n\nAfter, we stood outside and the sky had that particular Portsmouth purple that is made of sodium lamps and doubt. Tamsin bounced on the balls of her feet because she can\u2019t keep still when her brain is pleased. \u201cI liked the part where it worked,\u201d she said, grinning in a way that made me want to lie down on the pavement and declare myself done. \u201cI liked the part where the machine told you what to do and everyone stopped pretending they don\u2019t need machines. I liked the part where you didn\u2019t fall over. You see. You can be in a room with the idea of death and not punish yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was plastic,\u201d I said, but the protest came from far away. \u201cIt didn\u2019t have blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt had a chest,\u201d she said. \u201cThe rest we can compromise on.\u201d She looped her arm through mine like we were at school and she\u2019d just stolen a biscuit and wanted me to run. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d she said, and there it was again, a promise without details. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you about the not-dead. You can tell me about the boat. We\u2019ll be kind and we\u2019ll be wrong, and then we\u2019ll be right. And then we\u2019ll eat chips. There\u2019s a plan if I ever heard one.\u201d\n\nAt home that night, I took the leaflet out of the elastic band drawer and put it on the fridge with the magnet that says Southsea is Not a Phase in a font someone thought was clever. The kettle sang because that is its only party trick. The pipes muttered and the walls learned my name again. The stairs in my head did not go away, but they had dust on them now like things that have been left in lofts, and perhaps I could climb them without breaking. The city made its noises and each one I let be itself. In the morning, the gulls would start and the post would bring letters addressed to the boys we used to be and we would send them back or open them or burn them and either way, we would be here. The day stood just over the horizon like a man thinking about a dive. I stood in my kitchen and practiced saying, I am here, in a voice that did not tremble. The mirror over the sink looked at me as if I had lied and decided to forgive me anyway.",

                              "content": "In the morning the wind came up the street as if it had somewhere else to be and was offended to find me in its way. The kettle watched me the way a suspicious aunt watches a party, clucking under its breath, and when it boiled I poured and forgot to drink because my mouth was busy rehearsing an apology for something that hadn\u2019t happened yet. The city wore its weekday face, all fluorescent jackets and early arguments and the kind of laughter that comes from the throat because the head is still asleep. I put on the coat that thinks it\u2019s bigger than me and texted Tamsin that I would be at the front with small coins and patience. She sent back a single fish, then the knife emoji by accident, then an apology made of a dolphin. I put my mug in the sink in the way that says to yourself you\u2019ll deal with the cup\u2019s feelings later, and I went out into a day that had already started without me.\n\nChips smell a certain way on a wind that comes from the east; there\u2019s vinegar in it, and fat that has learned to admit it\u2019s going to live forever, and the sour of paper that\u2019s been damp more than once. The hut on the front had a queue like a sermon. The boy inside had hair that would cut your fingers if you touched it. I ordered two and said yes to salt because no is a joke we don\u2019t tell in this town when offered anything warm. I sat with my back to the wall because I am that kind of animal now and I watched the water pretend to be mild. A gull landed on the bin and gave me the look that says, I know your address. When Tamsin arrived, she came in sideways like she was overtaking the air. She had a scar on her knuckle I hadn\u2019t catalogued and trainers that made a case for comfort as a political position.\n\n\u201cYou look like you didn\u2019t sleep,\u201d she said, pleased, which is how you know the people who know you. \u201cGive me that. I\u2019m going to eat it wrong and offend the fish.\u201d\n\n\u201cJoin the committee,\u201d I said, handing her the hotter paper. \u201cI have a list of things I\u2019m not sleeping about if you want to trade.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never trade,\u201d she said, blowing on a chip as if it would listen. \u201cI hoard and then pretend I divvied. You ready for the horror story or shall we talk about sauces first.\u201d\n\n\u201cSauces won\u2019t help,\u201d I said, and the gull made a sound as if it agreed. \u201cYou said not-dead. You said nurse. You said later. I\u2019ve been introducing those words to each other in my head and they keep eloping.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not glamour,\u201d she said, and the tone of it told me that what followed would be a plain room with a bright light and not the costume drama my fear has paid for. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a knife-wielding spectre or a romantic illness. It was a bike. Of course it was a bike. This town breeds the urge to be on two wheels and too fast because the roads are small and nobody respects how big their car is. I was twenty-one and I had a job at a place where they pretend to be surprised when you return a dress with the tags still on. I was late, because I was always late, because I thought being on time meant they owned you. The mirror on the bus on Eastern Road had ideas about how much space its elbow needed. It tapped me in a way that would have been flirtatious if it weren\u2019t metal, and I introduced my whole self to the tarmac.\u201d\n\nShe said it like a list, but the space between the words had black ice in it. She licked salt off her thumb and looked at the water so that I could look at her without getting in trouble. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the first bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember thinking, oh, I am sideways, and then I was under a cloud that was a siren and someone said my name right. The nurse was a woman of an age where she had no patience for you thinking you were the first to try dying. She said my name like she was swatting a fly. She said, stay here. She said, open your eyes. She said, if you go to sleep you\u2019re going to make me shout and I\u2019ve had a day of shouting. She kept me going with rage. I liked her for that. The paramedic had brown eyes and a ring in his nose and he had hands like the underside of a boat, and he said nothing dramatic, he just said, I\u2019m here, with the calm of someone who\u2019s already seen the drama go wrong elsewhere. My head did its private bleeding in places you can\u2019t put a plaster, and then it stopped, because it decided to. I should be dead, by the numbers, if the bus had loved me more, if the ground had been ice, if the woman in the nurse shoes had been less tired. I am not dead because of physics and a person who refused to let my eyes close. It wasn\u2019t you. You weren\u2019t near. You were probably looking at water, being an arse.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am often being an arse,\u201d I said, and felt my insides move round to make space for this new furniture. \u201cSo it\u2019s a story about a bus and a woman with a voice that doesn\u2019t forgive. Good. I can be jealous of both without being complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a story about how death is boring, mostly,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a story about the way a town can try to kill you with its elbows and fail. It\u2019s a story about how after that, I thought, well, if something is going to get me it had its chance and it was clumsy. It made me bold in a stupid way for a year and then it made me careful. More boring. You\u2019d have liked me. I didn\u2019t shout at strangers in shops. I set alarms. I bought better helmets. It\u2019s not a story for a book. It\u2019s a line.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a story for a book,\u201d I said, offended on its behalf. \u201cIt goes like this: a woman met an ordinary disaster and decided to be extraordinary at not dying. That\u2019s a plot.\u201d\n\nShe snorted and stole the end of my sausage like a sibling. \u201cTell me yours,\u201d she said with her mouth full, rude. \u201cNot the blood. I don\u2019t care to audit your syncope. The other one. The stairs. You\u2019re carrying it like a child carries an egg to school and you\u2019ve got yolk on your jeans.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou said later,\u201d I said, stalling badly. \u201cYou said not here, not then. You said bus stop.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a bus stop for the rich,\u201d she said, nodding at the shelter where a woman in sunglasses pretended to read a timetable. \u201cWe can start or we can wait and let it rot and go soft and then it will leak. Your choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know enough to tell it,\u201d I said, miserable with the accuracy. \u201cWhen I try, the memory puts me in a lift between floors and pipes the same song in from both sides. There\u2019s the scarf. There\u2019s your laugh that wasn\u2019t kind that day. There\u2019s me being nineteen and useless. There\u2019s a noise that belongs to bone and floor and the part of my brain that likes to punish me has put it on loop and told me it\u2019s you. There\u2019s a second version where we both stumbled, and then the cut scene, and then I\u2019ve made a person out of guilt and he sleeps in my bed. I don\u2019t know which I\u2019m more afraid of, that I did it or that I didn\u2019t and I chose to wear it for fashion.\u201d\n\nShe finished the chips like a woman who has to leave no evidence and folded the paper with more care than it deserved. \u201cYou didn\u2019t kill me,\u201d she said again, not holy, just sure. \u201cYou did not. You were a bastard and a boy and you let me run the knife too far because you liked watching me be sharp. You didn\u2019t push. We were loud. We were not sober enough to be doing stairs. We frightened the wall. There was a bruise that looked like a continent. There was a week where I told everyone I had been mugged by gravity because it made a better story than, I was an idiot with a friend. There is later to talk about. There are rooms we haven\u2019t built yet for the talking. But not this, El. Find another coat if you need to be cold. Not this one.\u201d\n\nI hadn\u2019t known that words could be analgesic in that exact way, dulling one pain while leaving the rest deliciously raw. I breathed and the world came back with it. The gull on the bin screamed at a child because that\u2019s how you teach the young. The water did a thing with the light that was not for us. Tamsin dug into her pocket and produced a crumpled receipt covered in numbers that could be time or money and wrote the name ADAM on the back in a hand that talks too loud. \u201cWednesday,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the thing where they teach you how to press without breaking and how to talk without lying. You can be the bit of the team that keeps people in their own bodies. It\u2019s a skill. We\u2019ll be the kind of citizens people put on leaflets. You can sign your name to the hellman\u2019s man after if you like, get your stairs saved. I\u2019ll choose us where I can.\u201d\n\nWhen she is forgiving, it feels like you are the right size for the doorway. When she is commanding, it feels like being told to breathe by a person who knows more about breathing than you do. We walked along the front until the wind had finished with us, past a dog with a jumper knitted by love and a man selling hats even the hats were embarrassed by. She took a phone call in which someone at a venue declared that white comes in seventeen shades and she resisted explaining the existence of light. I stood near a bin and was human until the call ended, and then we were ourselves again, which is harder and better.\n\nThat afternoon a man came to put tape across the steps where Arthur rehearsed disaster and the tape was the particular yellow that wants to be crime and settles for caution. The tape sagged in the middle like hope. A child peeled a corner and her mother smacked the air next to her hand instead of the hand itself, which is a little genius Rena invented years ago. Dalloway & Sons had sent letters and the letters had the tone of a man who once wore a prefect\u2019s badge and is now paid to correct you gently. Rena had hers on the table under a lemon and said, \u201cWe\u2019re being consulted,\u201d like a complaint and also like she knew the importance of being seen even if the seeing is done with clipboards. She had her knees up on a second chair because the doctor had said to rest them and she was obeying in the way that is still an argument. \u201cI\u2019ll sign,\u201d she said, because she likes to be useful. \u201cI\u2019ll say I saw a man think he was better than stairs and the stairs say no. I\u2019ll say fix the stairs and fix the man and fix the part of this town that thinks people are too cheap to save.\u201d\n\nWe took her to the surgery to get the injection that would clean the edges of her pain without making promises it couldn\u2019t keep. The nurse there had the eyes of someone who collects spoons and stories. She swabbed and tapped and stabbed and Rena swore in the old language that isn\u2019t a language at all, and I nearly went sideways because the reality of the needle made my head overconfident. The nurse kept talking to me as if I were the patient and to Rena as if she were the accomplice. \u201cYou breathe,\u201d she said to me, which is a cruel thing to remind a body to do. \u201cYou don\u2019t look. You look at me and you tell me what you had for breakfast and you lie well.\u201d I told her about toast that had not existed and she rewarded me with a nod that did more for my blood than the glucose tablets in my pocket. Rena flexed like a woman showing off an engine. She said, \u201cI was very brave,\u201d and the nurse said, \u201cYou were tolerable,\u201d and wrote something down as if the pen needed the exercise.\n\nA week turned itself into several without permission, the way weeks do when you hang too many jobs on them and none of the jobs are called stop. I signed the paper for the stairs with the same biro I use for lists about milk and lies, and the Dalloway man phoned to say thank you in a way that meant keep going. The tape became a scaffold and the scaffold became proper steps, and the day they took the scaffold down three boys slid on the edges in celebration and Arthur shouted at them from the window like a bell. Tamsin booked three weddings in rooms that smelled of carpet shampoo and hope and one on a patch of grass by Canoe Lake where an old man fed swans and we were all a little afraid of him. I went to the community centre on Wednesdays and let Adam teach me about geography and premise more than he taught me about blood. He told me the slang the ambulance uses for the half-awake half-dead, for the street names people who weren\u2019t born here can\u2019t pronounce, for the ways bodies lie to you when they want attention. He said, \u201cSay I am here even when you\u2019re not sure you are,\u201d and I did, and sometimes I was.\n\nThe first time the pager went off in my pocket I nearly threw it into the harbour on reflex because it made a noise like a terrified insect. It buzzed and this is the thing phones no longer do; it assumed I could read information under pressure. The message said COPD, male, late seventies, breathless, and then a street I knew too well to need the postcode. I texted Tamsin the way you text when adrenaline sews your hands together, and she sent back, on my way, like we had been doing this for years. We met outside a house that had once been a shop and now was four flats and none of them had curtains that fit. A woman in a dressing gown opened the door and let us in the way a mother lets damp into a kitchen; helplessly, with ceremony. There on the sofa was a man the shape of a coat on a hanger, chest hitching like a hiccup had gone wrong. His name had four letters and three of them were tired.\n\nI did the thing they taught us about kneeling so your voice is a place and not a problem. I said my name, which is always the first bridge, and he said his as if he was apologising for choosing a small one. The room smelled of dust and that plastic Tube smell you get from a new kettle. Tamsin found the inhalers without asking permission because she has learned that permission is not necessary when someone can\u2019t remember how to say yes. I counted with him, long in, longer out, and he glared at me the way people glare at metronomes. The noise in my pocket said the ambulance was three minutes and that\u2019s a lie those noises tell to keep you brave, but they weren\u2019t far off. We didn\u2019t change the world. We kept him in it. When Adam came in with his machine and his kindness and his too-cool ring and put the mask on and the numbers began to behave, he looked at me and said, \u201cGood voice,\u201d and the part of me that is twelve did a handspring.\n\n\u201cI like the quiet ones,\u201d the man\u2019s wife said at the door, pressing a packet of custard creams into my palm like a medal. \u201cThe ones who don\u2019t need to narrate. You can come again when we do funerals. We do them on Thursdays.\u201d\n\n\u201cSave it for a Wednesday,\u201d said Tamsin, pocketing the biscuits as tax. \u201cHe likes a schedule.\u201d The old woman snorted and shut the door on our nonsense and the street put its noise back on as if we had not been inside a moment when time slowed enough to let a man borrow a breath.\n\nNot every call was kind. There was a boy with a mouth that couldn\u2019t find enough air because he had run to the bus and his chest didn\u2019t understand panic\u2019s math, and he cried when I put my hand on his back the way boys do when they\u2019re fourteen and furious at their bodies. There was a woman outside the co-op with blood on her chin because she had fainted elegantly and met the pavement with her mouth, and that one was a war in me and I lost the first round by looking, and Tamsin put her broad palm on my shoulder and turned me the way you redirect a horse and said, \u201cFetch the water and be nice to it,\u201d and I did, and someone else did the napkins. There was a man with his wedding ring stuck because he\u2019d got fatter from relief after his wife recovered and now his finger had opinions, and we cut the ring with a tool that made me respect metal while a stranger told me the entire plot of his favourite film because fear makes you generous with narrative.\n\nOn a night when the common smelled of fireworks left over from other people\u2019s birthdays and the foghorn sang its basso in the channel, Kai came round with a bag of pears as if he had foraged them and not bought them because they were on special. He sprawled on my one good chair as if it were his shape and told me he was thinking of moving in with a woman whose name made him go red and whose mother had a cat that liked his shoes, and he asked me if I was going to be all right without him ten minutes away, and I told him I was a grown person with a kettle, and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not, but I\u2019ll pretend you are,\u201d and I said, \u201cBuy a plant to impress the cat,\u201d and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s a different woman,\u201d because he likes to be adored. He looked at my leaflet on the fridge and he said, \u201cYou\u2019re an absolute weirdo,\u201d and he hugged me in a way that got me in the ribs and left, and I stood there in the small kitchen and let the room be too quiet, which is another kind of training.\n\nI saw the Dalloway man once in the market standing too near the fish. He was buying samphire like apologies and when he saw me he made the face you make when you\u2019ve run out of synonyms for persistent. He told me the Council had conceded that the steps were theirs and would in future be stairs that love feet, and he told me Arthur had received enough compensation to buy a mobility scooter that went too fast, and he told me he had a client who needed a witness for a different kind of fall, and I said, \u201cI am not your binoculars,\u201d and he said, \u201cYou\u2019ll change your mind when someone you love trips,\u201d and I said, \u201cThat happened a decade ago and here we are,\u201d and he put both hands up because he likes to end conversations looking like a man who can be trusted. He said Tamsin had declined to be eloquent for him, and I said, \u201cShe saves it for weddings and lawless boys,\u201d and he laughed like someone who wished he\u2019d been invited to be lawless.\n\nOn the Tuesday after the stairs remembered their job, Rena called me in a whisper to say, \u201cCome quick, there\u2019s a fox in the kitchen,\u201d and when I got there it was a very ordinary cat with a torn ear and an opinion about bread, and we fed it tuna and called it Mr. Spence because that was the landlord\u2019s boss at the surgery and he deserved to be reincarnated as a scavenger. Rena made tea that would singe your hair and told me with relish about a woman at bingo who had called another woman a cheater because her lucky dabber was too lucky, and how this had escalated to the point where security had been mentioned as a concept, and how Rena had diffused the situation by pretending to faint in a way that did not involve any blood, and how she\u2019d got her friend a second book of numbers out of it because nothing soothes the savage heart like a discount. She told me to take my shoes off because they dragged the world over her floor. She told me to put my shoes back on because my socks were an insult. She told me she was proud of me for not doing a dramatic Victorian fall in someone else\u2019s hallway, and I told her she made it easier to stand up. When she fell asleep in the chair with her mouth open on the second advertisement break, I turned the volume down and rolled a cushion under her head with the care you use for a bomb. Mr. Spence watched me with the bored loathing of cats and then made an audible decision that I might live.\n\nWe made a small habit of it, me and Tamsin and the Wednesday training and the occasional pager with its angry bee, and the Saturdays where I was the winter-coat presence at the edge of a wedding, holding a glass steady while someone tried to cry without ruining eyeliner, or carrying flowers that smelled like all the good days had been boiled down. On a Thursday she made me go with her to the registry office because a couple had argued all the way to the door and now couldn\u2019t find the extra breath to make vows, and she stood behind the registrar like a stagehand with a god complex and nodded at the right moments, and when the woman said I will, I saw Tamsin make the smallest fist by her side like she had scored a goal. On a Monday we walked past the house where Marwick\u2019s blinds were crooked and she told me he\u2019d taken to shouting at the television because it doesn\u2019t shout back with the particular obscenity he prefers, and she had told him to be kind in case he needed kindness later, and he had told her kindness is just the long way to weakness, and she had told him he was wrong and would learn, and we both looked at each other because we are still waiting to learn.\n\nThe night we finally made the bus stop out of air and stood under it like good citizens and told each other the history we\u2019d owed, it rained the way this town likes to rain, sideways and petty. There is a bus stop at the end of Palmerston that is a rumour in winter and a kissing booth in June, and we took it from two girls wearing eyelashes like moth wings and one boy who pretended he had a date with the driver. The plastic was scratched with declarations that had outlasted the relationships. The schedule had been replaced so many times the pin had made a permanent hole. Tamsin tucked the cigarette behind her ear because she knows when to use her mouth for other work.\n\n\u201cIt was not you,\u201d she said, and the echo from all the other times she had said that didn\u2019t make it less. \u201cIt was me and a man who wore aftershave like a threat and a ring that didn\u2019t fit his finger. It was his stairs because he\u2019d just got the flat and men like to show you their steps, like they made them. There was a party that was a room of men pretending beer is personality. There was a joke I made that he didn\u2019t like because it made him visible to himself, and he didn\u2019t know how to be visible without falling apart. He put his hand on my throat in the way of someone who has watched too much telly and learned the wrong lessons from it, and then he took it off because he is not a murderer and because there were witnesses and because the world is not a show. I went downstairs in a way that was almost a run, and I missed the third, and my knee took a holiday from my leg, and the nurse with the eyebrows held my face while the man with the nose ring did a thing with a splint and I thought, this is what happens when you flirt with men who want to be doors. Not stairs. Doors. That\u2019s the story of the nearly dead with my name on it. The stairs you\u2019re guilty about are the stairs you were irritating on. You were not hands. You were a boy. It\u2019s not flattering. It\u2019s better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to put it down,\u201d I said, and the relief of wanting is its own kind of weight. \u201cI want to put it down and keep it on a shelf where I can be reminded without being punished.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can,\u201d she said, and then laughed at the look on my face because it was too easy a sentence to be true. \u201cBut you\u2019ll pick it up again. That\u2019s what we do. We tidy and then we rediscover mess and then we find better boxes. I will hold it sometimes for you. You can hold mine sometimes when I would like to pretend I was never stupid. We will be terrible at it and then a little better. And we will be civil when we have to be and kind when we can be and cruel only when someone is trying to put a hand on a throat. How\u2019s that for a vow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d marry that,\u201d I said, and she made a face like a priest caught laughing.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get grand,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re a man whose brain can be undone by tomatoes. Keep humble.\u201d\n\nA bus came and huffed and opened its door like a mouth and looked at us as if to say, are you getting on or are you always going to be this. We shook our heads in unison and the driver smirked because there is nothing drivers like better than being right about you. We walked home the long way past the arcade where the children of men who never learned to lose were teaching their sons how to shake a joystick until it cooperated, past the photo booth where a couple were trying to understand how their own faces could change so much from frame to frame, past the shop that sells high-visibility jackets and hope. My phone buzzed with the small emergency of a woman who had cut her thumb making soup for a neighbour, and I sent Adam three question marks and he sent back a postcode and a thumb and a heart. We went and put a plaster on a person who shouldn\u2019t have been alone with knives, and I said I am here in a voice that didn\u2019t tremble, and Tamsin mugged at me behind the woman\u2019s back until I snorted and had to pretend to cough.\n\nLater, at my sink, watching the water do its science, I caught my face again in the little mirror and tried the mouth that says we carry on. It fit better this time and that frightened me and soothed me both. The kettle made the house sound like it was thinking. The gulls had stopped for the day as if a supervisor had come round and told them there would be forms if they continued. The city ticked its radiators. Somewhere, in a different flat, a newly mended man tried not to shout at the news because stairs have a way of teaching you about what breaks. Somewhere else a nurse took off her shoes and put on her ordinary feet and let the evening have her. Somewhere else again a bus driver went home and did not talk because holding other people\u2019s schedules in your head all day is its own silence. I washed a cup and did not cut my hand and felt like a magician who refuses to show his sleeves.\n\nAt the end of the week Adam said there was a football match and the ambulance service had too few hands for too many lads who think singing is first aid. He asked if I could stand by the gate with a bag full of water and stern words, and Tamsin said she would come because she likes to watch men try to be serious in shorts. Fratton Park had its winter lights up because football has its own seasons that ignore weather. The air tasted of onions and jealousy. A boy not yet old enough to regret anything threw up on his own shoes and a man old enough to be his grandfather told him to aim better next time. We stood with our arms crossed like bouncers in a comedy sketch and gave out plasters to the kind of cuts the day has on it when it\u2019s nearly funny. In the second half there was a scuffle with more choreography than harm, the kind where everyone wants to be stopped and nobody wants to admit that, and Tamsin inserted herself with the skill of a pint in a crowded bar and said, \u201cNo,\u201d in a tone that belongs to mothers and magistrates. The knot un-tied. A man with a white scar at the corner of his eye stared at me like he\u2019d met me before and couldn\u2019t place where, and then he nodded in a way that said, not today, and the game resumed pretending to matter.\n\nOn the way out a woman tapped my arm with the special permission reserved for people who\u2019ve watched you be useful and therefore own a small part of your time. She said, \u201cYou\u2019re the fish boy, aren\u2019t you,\u201d and I said, \u201cNot anymore,\u201d and she said, \u201cGood,\u201d and we both laughed because there are jobs that take pieces of you and leave you with scales. She told me her daughter wanted to be a paramedic because she\u2019d watched a video on the internet of a man being revived in an airport and decided that was the only magic worth learning. I told her to tell the girl to practice saying I am here without sounding grand. She said she would and then she told me she had never known what to do with her hands and now she did and I said, \u201cPut them in your pockets,\u201d and she said, \u201cIn this town they call that attitude,\u201d and I said, \u201cThen buy better pockets,\u201d and she clapped me on the arm like I had told a joke that made sense to both of us.\n\nThe next morning the Dalloway man sent a photograph to my phone of the new steps with the ribbon cut, some councillor who looks the same in every town holding the scissors and pretending to have done anything except sign, and under it a caption that said, you did this, and I wrote back, the man\u2019s shin did this, and he sent three laughing faces because he is capable of humility in pixels. I showed Rena and she said, \u201cAbout time,\u201d and then cried in the kitchen where you are allowed, and I put my hand on her shoulder and left it there even when she made the face that means, get off me, I am not sentimental, because I have learned to translate.\n\nAt the edge of sleep, nights, the stairs still come. They arrive like a child with a story they need you to hear at two in the morning. The scarf is still red. The sound is still itself. But it is in a room with other sounds now, the ship, the kettle, the bus. It is a citizen. That is what I am trying to be. Not healed. Not clean. Present. Available for the noise and what it makes of a day. When the pager goes, I put on my coat. When Tamsin calls, I answer. When Kai texts a picture of a plant that is dying and asks me how to make it live, I tell him to stop talking to it like an enemy. When Rena says, \u201cHeaven is a council house with stairs that don\u2019t kill you,\u201d I say, \u201cAmen,\u201d and mean it. I say I am here into the mirror, and sometimes I believe it long enough to say it again to someone who is not me.",

It came off the water with pins in it and threaded itself through the gaps around my window like it had paid rent. The kettle sulked and clicked and got on with the job. I stood with my hands around the mug and told them to believe in heat. The city had been threatening a storm all week, the streetlights jittering like nervous horses, the ferries testing their horns as if to remind us they could be opera when they wanted to. Rena called at eight to say the bingo had been cancelled in advance because the hall roof had ideas, and she sounded put out in the way she only gets when fate thinks it\u2019s funny. \u201cIf it\u2019s going to rain, it should rain,\u201d she said. \u201cNo half measures. I\u2019ve set out pots on principle.\u201d I promised to come over later with bread because bread is how we pretend to be ready for anything, and she told me to bring the good jam because she was not in the mood to be poor in that way.\n\nBy ten the sky had made its choice and come down. The street outside my block turned from road to river in the time it takes to swear and mean it. The gulls tried to hang in the air like mugs on a rack and mostly succeeded because arrogance is one of their better tricks. The pager went before the rain hit its rhythm. It rattled in my pocket and made my ribs remember every time a phone has had bad news. COPD again, said the little screen, like an old friend you don\u2019t have the courage to tell to stop calling, and a building in Eastney I knew by its habit of peeling paint. I texted Tamsin out of muscle memory and she sent back a single umbrella and then, as if she had thought better of leaving her meaning in pictures, I\u2019m five away, and I put my coat on in the way you put on armour you don\u2019t entirely trust.\n\nThe stairwell smelled like damp bread and old laughter. I hit the street and the rain hit back, thick enough to make you feel like you were swimming upright. The road to Eastney was an argument between taxis and vans and one man on a bike who had convinced himself he was immortal for the morning. The power lines hummed like a low choir. I cut across by the lido, its water slopping at the edges, green as if it had kept a summer it wasn\u2019t allowed. Tamsin appeared out of the downpour like a conspiracy, hair slicked to her skull, mouth set in the line that means she\u2019s already decided this will be fine.\n\nInside the flat was the collected smell of a life that had fought damp and not always won. The old man in the chair had lungs playing a drum solo badly. His wife had two blankets, neither of which was doing what blankets pretend, and a face that had set like plaster around a shape it didn\u2019t want to admit to. We did the thing we knew: introductions, your name is a bridge, count with me, the long out breath like you\u2019re bullying a candle, you are not alone. The oxygen machine in the corner had a red light on that wanted to be an alarm if someone gave it permission. \u201cPower\u2019s been flicking,\u201d said the wife. \u201cIt thinks it\u2019s a club.\u201d The mask hissed and offered cold air like a mean charity. Tamsin perched on the arm of the chair because chairs tell her their intentions, and I took the old man\u2019s hand because hands lie less than mouths and I wanted to know if he was willing to stay.\n\nWe were halfway through the numbers when something upstairs happened that the building didn\u2019t like. It was a thud with a note in it that made my bones tune themselves, and then the thin shout of someone saying a name that wasn\u2019t being answered. Tamsin looked at me as if to ask whether the noise was in my head and then we both moved because if it wasn\u2019t, we were late. The old woman clutched my sleeve as if she was claiming me for her team, and I said, \u201cTwo minutes,\u201d in the tone you\u2019re taught for emergency promises. Tamsin took the stairs two at a time and I went less prettily and we came round the turn to find a door open and a green runner rug crumpled like a letter.\n\nHe was sprawled halfway across the landing, a fishing jacket on that made him look like he\u2019d tried to prepare for weather in the privacy of his home. His hair had the white of a man who has recently stopped pretending to dye it. The radiator had come loose in the fall and the sound of it trying to be attached to a pipe and failing was a kind of whimper. There was blood. Of course there was blood. It had a way of finding me even when I took the scenic route. It came from his scalp, which is to say there was more of it than my brain believed a head should have, ridiculous amounts that chased themselves down the side of his face and into the rug, making patterns that would have interested me in another life. He made a noise that reminded me of the beginning of a laugh, which is a terrible thing for a body to do when it\u2019s trying to convince you it\u2019s unhurt.\n\nMy throat did the small close over it does when red is in the room, a sympathetic door. The trick is to get ahead of that door before it slams. I said, \u201cHello,\u201d loud enough to bully the colour back into being just a colour, and then I did the thing they showed us with head wounds, that dance between knowing it looks worse than it is and not letting it be worse than it is. Tamsin had the kit open and the gauze in my hand before I had properly asked. \u201cPressure,\u201d she said, and the word is so bossy it helps. I folded and pressed and looked at the skirting board and his eyes and the nail in the plaster where a picture used to be, anywhere except the theatre of it. The man said something about wet and cold that might have been a joke or a complaint. I said my name again because sometimes it\u2019s the only tool I have that bites.\n\nHe did not like me. This was obvious in the way he tried to pull away as if my face offended him. He had the kind of posh the navy gives a certain kind of boy and he wore it even lying on his own carpet. \u201cYou\u2019re the fish lad,\u201d he said, which would have made me laugh if my mouth weren\u2019t busy being useful. \u201cThe one who fainted over a sardine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t faint,\u201d I said on instinct, which made Tamsin smirk because she likes me better when I argue myself into being visible. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be friends you and I. I\u2019m going to give your head back to you if you let me.\u201d The gauze warmed under my hand. The red tried to behave. The radiator clunked like a drunk trying not to admit it. Tamsin had called Adam without telling me she had moved and then moved again; I watched her mouth make words that would fetch a vehicle as if she were ordering bread.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re touching me,\u201d he said, like it was a surprise and a complaint in one.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d I said. \u201cI am here.\u201d The sentence just came out of me. He made a face like he\u2019d heard that before from someone he hadn\u2019t wanted to trust. I kept talking because the part of me that is twelve had learned how to take over the speaking when blood tried to run the show. I told him the thing about starlings at the Common and how they managed to fly without leaking into each other, and he looked at me sideways and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a strange boy,\u201d and I said, \u201cMan, technically,\u201d and he said, \u201cDebatable,\u201d and then the room let me breathe.\n\nAdam arrived with a woman I didn\u2019t know and the air changed as it always does when someone whose job it is to stop endings enters. They put their hands where mine had been and told the bleeding to be less dramatic. There was an exchange about blood thinners and the word warfarin that always sounds like a ship. The woman asked him how much he\u2019d had to drink and he told her the truth with the sheepishness of a man who has lived in a place where everyone knows if you lie. Adam looked at me and nodded in that way that says, see, you didn\u2019t run, and my head did the thing where it measures its own edges and finds them intact.\n\nAfter, back downstairs with the old man and his oxygen that had decided to behave now the building had calmed and the electricity remembered duty, I found myself shaking just in the fingers, the rest of me bored with the idea of panic. The old woman patted my wrist like a pigeon pecks bread, distractedly affectionate. \u201cHe\u2019s a bastard,\u2019 she said, meaning upstairs, which told me more than the fall had, \u201cbut he\u2019s our bastard and he plays whist on Thursdays and he knows where the good chips are.\u201d Tamsin said something kind that sounded like a threat, and we left with the rain making our hair into a statement.\n\nAt noon the whole of Southsea became candles and teaspoons because the power decided it had had enough of work. Shops put handwritten signs in windows and discovered their pens were failing too. The bakery sold out of buns in twenty minutes and then stood there like a stage set, full of flour and apologies. The Spinnaker looked like it would like to take the afternoon off. I went to Rena\u2019s with the bread because the one thing we can control is sandwiches, and found her sitting in the dark with a torch under her chin like a child telling a ghost story. She was delighted with herself because she had boiled an egg on a camping stove and not set fire to the curtains. \u201cI told the boy upstairs not to light his barbecue in the hall,\u201d she said. \u201cHe asked me if I was the fire brigade. I said today, love, everyone is the fire brigade.\u201d\n\nWe played cards by the window and cheated with total sincerity, and she told me stories of storms with names that used to matter and how they had measured them by which tiles went and whose cat by. The fear in me had been given a job that morning and it had worked hard and was sleepy. I felt almost like a person who could be relied upon. When the lights came back on at four the whole building gave a sigh like an old woman sitting down in a good chair. Rena hissed at the bulb for being presumptuous. \u201cI liked us better in the dark,\u201d she said. \u201cYou looked less worried.\u201d I told her she looked like a queen in a power cut and she told me to stop being a fool and pass the butter.\n\nDalloway sent a text at six that made me grimace even before I read it because his name in a line looks like a judgment. Can you and Miss Keen come in tomorrow? it said. Marwick\u2019s solicitor is asking for statements about a separate incident. The words separate incident rattled in my head like a coin in a jar. I showed Tamsin without comment and she made the face that means she is deciding whether to set something on fire or file it neatly. \u201cHe\u2019s like lichen,\u201d she said. \u201cYou don\u2019t notice him until he\u2019s everywhere.\u201d\n\nIn bed the rain did its hard work on the glass and I listened to it argue with the gutters as if they owed it money. The city hummed with the relief of lights being lights, the fridge coming back to its small vocalising, the neighbours putting on the television with a kind of vengeance. I let the day replay in my skull like a tape I couldn\u2019t misplace if I tried. There was red in it. There was the thunk of a skull against a skirting board. There were my hands doing a job my brain had held back from for years. There was a sentence that had crawled out of me without being invited and yet had the right name on it. I am here, I had said, to a man who didn\u2019t want me touching him, and he had not died out of spite. I fell asleep with that in my mouth like an aspirin.\n\nMorning came out of the east the way it likes to, with the look of someone who is trying to be friendly and is not sure how. Dalloway\u2019s office had the thermostat set to a temperature meant to disorient your softer parts. His assistant had a haircut that gave her people skills she pretended not to own. He poured us water as if we had come to confess a murder. \u201cIt isn\u2019t what you\u2019re thinking,\u201d he said, which is precisely what you say when it is. \u201cMarwick\u2019s ex-tenant is making noise. She claims he shoved her in the doorway last autumn when she came to ask about her deposit. He says he didn\u2019t. The stairs got blamed. They always do. I need people who have lived in his buildings to say what kind of man he is around his doors.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s jaw made a shape I had been introduced to in kitchens and corridors since the day I met her. \u201cWhat kind is that,\u201d she said, very mild.\n\n\u201cThe kind,\u201d said Dalloway, fussing with a paperclip like it was a pet, \u201cwho might push without thinking because the world is in his way. Or the kind who has never in his life lifted a hand to anyone who didn\u2019t deserve a handshake. Either will do, depending on where you\u2019re standing.\u201d He looked at us with that particular male hope that women might offer him a dramatic truth because it would help his paperwork be a poem.\n\n\u201cWe can say he is the kind who thinks other people\u2019s time is soup he can drink,\u201d said Tamsin. \u201cWe can say he is the kind whose voice gets louder when you say no. We can say he is the kind who borrows ladders and loses receipts. We can say stairs don\u2019t like him. But you don\u2019t get to make me do your job without paying me in something better than gratitude.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want money?\u201d he said, surprised, which told me he hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the principle of the city.\n\n\u201cI want my people not to have to prove they\u2019re not liars,\u201d she said. \u201cWrite your letter so it says what it should whether I sign it or not. And write him a letter that says be small in future. You know how to do that. Pretend he\u2019s a council.\u201d She stood up without giving the chair time to argue and I followed, because she goes through doors like a weather system and you take your chances.\n\nOutside on the pavement that always smells faintly of fish because of the shop three doors down, she put her hands in the pockets of her jacket like a man in a photograph of a band. \u201cWe don\u2019t owe him our blood,\u201d she said, as if the morning were a person who required telling off. \u201cWe\u2019ve done the stairs. We do not have to become the kind of people who turn every memory into a court.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would be very good in a court,\u201d I said, and she pulled a face as if I had insulted her by complimenting.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll make me buy a suit and then I\u2019ll become the version of myself that sends emails at midnight. I like being the version of myself that knows the exact number of chairs in a room without counting.\u201d She glanced at my hands in that habit of hers that pretends she is not checking if I am shaking. I wasn\u2019t. I might later, but I wasn\u2019t. She looked pleased in that way she never admits.\n\nThe town ran like it does when weather has had its say and lost. We worked a wedding that pretended to be under control and was not, because the band were two hours late after being sent to the wrong Waverley by a text with a typo and the groom\u2019s mother had a nosebleed that looked like a disaster but was just a conversation stopper. I held a napkin like a banner and looked at the ceiling while Tamsin tilted heads and told fear to stop shouting. The bride decided at the last minute that she hated lilies because they smelled like sadness, and Tamsin put her arm through mine and said, \u201cWe will fetch more roses,\u201d and we did, consulting with a florist who acted like he had never seen panic before and wanted to keep it as a pet.\n\nOn the way back, carrying too many stems for a man with my centre of gravity, we cut through the little park near the library with the willow that thinks it lives by a lake. A man was sitting on the bench with a dog at his feet that looked like it had been compiled from spare parts and a bottle of whiskey in one hand like a fairy tale, and he was crying with his mouth shut. I don\u2019t see myself in a lot of men but I saw something of my worst self in him, that determination to be stoic and therefore in trouble. Tamsin slowed, almost imperceptibly, and the dog lifted its head with that particular dignity dogs have when they haven\u2019t been treated right. I stopped because I have learned that sometimes stopping is the actual job.\n\nYou doing all right, mate, said Tamsin in a tone you can lift people with. He nodded in a way that meant no and yes and don\u2019t you dare. The bottle had writing on it that wanted you to think it was a friend. There was blood on his knuckle where he had punched the wrong thing. I felt the old horse in my chest start to drag its hooves and I told it no. I said my line. I am here. It is a ridiculous sentence out of context. It is sometimes the only one that turns a room back into a room. He looked at me with the special contempt a certain sort of man reserves for tenderness and then he gave up and started talking and he did not stop for long enough for Tamsin to ask the questions she had in her pocket. His wife had gone two weeks ago to her sister\u2019s in Fareham and he had used the quiet as an excuse to become smaller than he had been promised. The dog had been unfed in the way dogs are unfed when men are ashamed. He had cut his hand on a can of beans because justice likes to be sly. We fed the dog a biscuit I had forgotten was in my coat. We cleaned his knuckle without making a speech about infection. We called his sister because he asked us to and he cried some more because it is easier on the phone. We did nothing that would look interesting written up by a policeman. It felt like digging a car out of sand with a teaspoon. It felt like the only thing that makes a week difference.\n\nThat night, lying on my ridiculous high bed like a man who doesn\u2019t trust floors, I said the sentence out loud to the ceiling, quietly, in case the ceiling was trying to sleep. I am here. It has become a superstition, like touching wood, like counting to five while the kettle boils. It has become a spell. The stairs in my head were quieter because the storm had found them and put seaweed on them. The guilt had a shape I could walk round rather than a fog I kept swallowing. I thought of the old man\u2019s scalp and the foolish theatre of head wounds and of my hand being useful where once it would have undone me. I thought of the dog eating a dry biscuit like grace. I thought of Dalloway and his neat hands and the way he needs us to turn our history into his casework, and I hoped for his sake he has a woman like Rena to tell him to be small when he needs telling.\n\nIt is not neat, any of it. We do not become new people because we decide to. My fear still watches me when I change a lightbulb as if it knows how much can go wrong with glass. I still cross the street sometimes to avoid a man with a ring on his hand because old warning systems don\u2019t care for updates. Sometimes I find myself looking at a knife in a kitchen and telling it what it is, out loud, so it doesn\u2019t misunderstand me. Sometimes in the supermarket I swear I can smell blood even in the aisle where they keep tinned tomatoes, which is unfair and ridiculous and how my brain says hello. But on Wednesdays I go and kneel by plastic and make the chest rise and pretend the absence of a face is a kindness. On Saturdays I watch brides insist on impossible flowers and I watch Tamsin make them bloom anyway out of paper and politics. On Sundays I sit in Rena\u2019s kitchen and eat jam that tastes more of sugar than fruit and hope she will tell me the peach story again.\n\nIn late January the foghorn started up in the corner of the evening where men on the buses start to nod against the window and teenagers begin to multiply in corners. It blew the long note that knits you into your bed. I wrote my name on a piece of paper I had been ignoring, the one from the ambulance service that said, if you want, if you can, there\u2019s a course where you might be allowed to ride along and learn how to be the person in the back who doesn\u2019t flinch. I folded it and put it in an envelope and took it to the letterbox at the end of my road where the paint is always a step behind the rust. I put it in the slot before I could decide it was a romantic gesture rather than a plan. The world did not change shape. The streetlight did not applaud. A cat went under a car with the air of someone making a formal exit from a dull party. I turned my collar up and went to the sea to see if it looked different now that I had decided a very small thing. It looked the same. It looked enormous and bored and gorgeous and indifferent. It looked like it had all the time in the world. I stood there and told it, quietly so as not to make a fool of myself, that I was here, and it did what seas do, which is ignore me completely and make me better anyway.",

                              "content": "The letter did not announce itself with trumpets. It came through the slot and sulked on the mat as if it had been told off on the way. The envelope was the obstinate brown of bureaucracy, and the logo in the corner was the same polite blue that asks you to rate your pain. I stood with toast and considered the risk of hope, which in this house sticks to the teeth. I opened it with the butter knife because the proper knife and I are on speaking terms only in good light. The words were simple, almost embarrassed: we are pleased to confirm your observer shift, Saturday night, 19:00\u201303:00, report to St. Mary\u2019s, wear sensible shoes. There was a line about confidentiality that made my chest do its own signature. There was a line about not getting in the way that felt like an old friend. There was a name at the bottom that wasn\u2019t Adam but could be someone who knows Adam\u2019s ringtone.\n\nI took it to Rena because she is my official reader of notices and doom. She put her glasses down her nose like a teacher who can make fractions feel personal. \u201cObserver,\u201d she read with relish, as if the word observed her back. \u201cSo you get to watch and breathe and not break anything? That\u2019s your calling, dear heart. You can be the wallpaper of medicine.\u201d She kissed the top of my head to bless the endeavour and told me to eat before the city ate me, which is the closest she gets to a speech. I texted Tamsin a photograph of the letter and she replied with three sirens, then a string of knives and fish until the phone looked like a kitchen drawer, then, finally, words: I am going to buy you sensible shoes you will hate.\n\nIn the afternoons the Dockyard is better behaved than it\u2019s famous for. The Warrior sits with her iron sides pretending this was always what ships looked like, and the Victory sulks under scaffolding like a celebrity getting dental work. Tamsin had conned a couple with a love of history into thinking vows taste better under a figurehead. The events office had given her a badge that would have made a lesser person unbearable, and she used it to make men with epaulettes move chairs. There is something about being beneath a ship that makes everyone stand up straighter, as if the air is full of rank. I tied ribbon round cutlery until my fingers learned the braille of it, and she negotiated a truce between the caterers and a woman whose cake wanted to be eight tiers of apology. We took a minute on the quay when the light folded itself into the water like a handkerchief and watched a ferry write its slow sentence out of harbour. \u201cRemember when we used to race the Gosport,\u201d she said, and I said, \u201cYou remember anything that lets you win,\u201d and she said, \u201cLearn from the best.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday Dalloway sent a message that had the energy of a man with a ruler. He wanted statements about the ex-tenant, the separate incident that was not separate from anything, and he wanted them yesterday, which is his favourite time. Tamsin looked at the text and sighed like a kettle with no switch. \u201cHe thinks our lives are a filing cabinet,\u201d she said. \u201cHe can have my words when I decide where they go.\u201d She asked me if I wanted to meet the woman before we put our names under Dalloway\u2019s, and I said yes because I have learned that most crisis is improved by a face. We met her at the cafe that used to be a bank and still pretends it has vaults under the muffins. Her name was Saffron because sometimes Portsmouth has a sense of humour, and she had a baby on her hip whose stare could have stripped paint. She told us about the doorway like it was a bad joke: the knock, the hand that found a shoulder instead of a wall, the apology that arrived later than the bruise. \u201cHe said he tripped on the mat,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said I startled him. The way men say you made them do it and think they\u2019ve got away with a magic trick.\u201d Tamsin was kind in the way that says, I will carry some of this and you don\u2019t get to argue. We told her we would put our names where they might do a little good and not be used for anything else. We told her about Dalloway\u2019s tie without saying his name. The baby grabbed my thumb and the scar on my hand lit up like a map. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign,\u201d Saffron said, and I said, \u201cOf what,\u201d and she said, \u201cOf someone else being present,\u201d and for once the word did not make me wish to run.\n\nSaturday came dressed as rain. St. Mary\u2019s does the kind of quiet that tastes of bleach and history. The ambulance bay had its line of green machines angled like greyhounds at a starting gate, and inside the station was the smell of tea so strong I could hear it. A wall of lockers wore names like medals. Adam appeared out of a room with a washing machine and a man\u2019s sleep got caught in his hair. He handed me a hi-vis vest that made me look like a cautionary tale and told me the rules as if he were reading me a bedtime story: don\u2019t touch needles, don\u2019t argue with drunk people unless you\u2019re bored, don\u2019t faint in the back because it frightens the driver, don\u2019t post about anything except how good the biscuits are. His partner that night was Nic, who had a ponytail that could cut you and a wit like a scalpel. She shook my hand like we had decided to be on the same team. \u201cStand where we tell you,\u201d she said, \u201cand if you start going, sit neatly.\u201d\n\nThe first hour was a list of almosts. A woman who had misread a sell-by date and convinced herself she was poisoned, a man who had noticed his heart beating and resented it, a call that was cancelled when the caller remembered this is what gin does in January. We ate crisps behind a petrol station like criminals and Nic told me the whole of a gossip that involved a wrong baby, a right dog and a funeral that had to be delayed because the vicar knew the deceased too well. The radio spoke in acronyms as if being coy might make emergencies elegant. My head adjusted its brim and tried not to anticipate red.\n\nAround eleven a cyclist introduced himself to a car door. It happens as often as people breathe badly. He was a boy with a beard as if he\u2019d borrowed it, lying in the rain with his bike considering emigration. There was blood at his eyebrow that made too big a show of it, and his knee had the kind of swelling that looks like a personality. I looked for the floor to tilt and it did not oblige me. I held the umbrella over his face and said my line, and he made the old joke about angels that even atheists know. Nic glued his eyebrow as if she were making art out of something that had gone wrong, and Adam made his knee a number and decided it could survive without hospitals if it were bribed with rest. A woman came out of a house and declared herself a nurse and told us how we were doing it wrong in the specific way of retired professionals, and Adam thanked her as if she had handed us a feather. The boy cried a little in the polite way and told me he was supposed to propose next week on Portsdown Hill at sunset, and I said, \u201cTry sunrise, you\u2019ll have it to yourself,\u201d and he looked at me as if I had invented a new joy. When we left, Adam said, \u201cThat face you do where you look like you can see the ending? Keep that. People will tell you the next part if you hold your mouth like that,\u201d and I put the compliment in my pocket and took it out again to check it was real.\n\nAfter midnight the calls changed shape. There is a point where Saturday turns into something else and the city\u2019s pulses coincide. We went to a kebab queue where a man was bleeding from the knuckles because the air had offended him, and he refused plasters as if they had a political leaning. We went to a girl on a pavement who had put into her body more than narratives and had decided to stop being awake about it, and Nic crouched and told her in a factual voice that breathing was back in fashion. We went to a house in Milton where a woman was in labour and thought she shouldn\u2019t be, not yet, not here, and Adam did the maths with his eyebrows and phoned the unit and said words like \u201cmultip\u201d and \u201cparity\u201d that made me feel I had walked into Latin class. The bedroom smelled of shampoo and heat and surrender. The baby arrived in a sound that could have been laughter or despair. There was blood, because there is always blood when life thinks it is being generous, and my tongue tasted tin and my neck remembered it could be a narrowing door, and I stepped into the hallway and counted the pores in the paint and returned with towels and an apology. The baby cried, which is to say the room remembered what lungs are for. The father tried to faint and I told him there was a queue and he laughed and didn\u2019t. On the way out Adam clapped my shoulder and said, \u201cThat one gets a blue hat,\u201d and in the back I decided to love the word hat.\n\nAt two there was a call that arrived with a weight in it. The radio did a tone nobody jokes about and said the word chest too flat to be the muscle. We were at the leisure centre car park in a minute and a half that lasted an hour. A man was on the tarmac under the sodium lights like a fallen torch. He was the kind of fifty it takes some men a war to get to. Someone had tried compressions and done their best without being told how. He was grey in the curious way that doesn\u2019t look like skin. This is where the films are wrong. There was no violins, only the sound of plastic tearing and a voice that had decided it would not cry. Adam said, \u201cOn,\u201d in a voice that peeled stickers and Nic stuck pads where pads like to live and the machine had its say. I knelt and put my hands where the woman with the hair at the community centre had told me, and the breastbone did the bend it does when you ask it for more, and I counted because numbers are the only gods that go quiet when you talk to them. The machine was kind enough to advise electricity and the man\u2019s body answered in the involuntary way that makes you feel you have asked too much. There was a smear of blood at his mouth, a small red parenthesis, and the part of my head that wants to be dramatic stepped towards the stage and I told it to sit down and stop showing off. I was the metronome. Nic breathed the air in and out with a mask that made everyone look more human. Adam watched the screen like there was a secret map on it. The siren of the second crew arrived and added another note to the anthem. It was long, and then it was suddenly not, because the time compressed when the monitor decided to stop being a flat liar and become a little mountain range. \u201cGot one,\u201d said Adam, cautious as if praise might frighten it. The man\u2019s chest decided to do the work without us. When they loaded him, his hand came up and grabbed Nic\u2019s sleeve in a full, strange gesture, as if he were pulling himself back into the world with her cloth. I sat back on my heels and realised the wet had gone through my trousers and into my bones, and I realised I was hungry, which is how you know the body has decided to stay.\n\nAt three an old man refused to let us in because he had never let anyone in after midnight in seventy years and wasn\u2019t starting now, so Adam shouted directions through a letterbox while the old man managed his own inhalers and I held the torch like a technician in a very niche theatre. By half past we were back where the kettles live and Nic had found a biscuit she had been saving for a day with this colour, and Adam put the kettle on and then turned it off because the radio told us we didn\u2019t earn tea yet. When four arrived, it did so with the thin light the city keeps in a drawer. We were released into it with the odd ceremony of people who have put off sleep for too long. Adam hugged me without making it a thing, his jacket cold and soft with the smell of other lives. \u201cYou didn\u2019t faint,\u201d he said, as if that was a joke and not a sacrament. \u201cYou didn\u2019t run. You wore that vest with dignity. Come again when you fall out with Saturdays.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday the city had been rinsed and left on the line. The streets were tired of their own reflections. I took two hours to stare at the wall and let myself have the shakes I hadn\u2019t had time for, and when my hands had finished making music on their own, I took bread to Rena and told her about hat babies without telling her about how close some men can get to not being men anymore. She made me eat eggs as if it were a legal requirement, and then she took my face in her dry hands and said, \u201cYou look steadier. You look like you leaned on something that didn\u2019t mind,\u201d and I cried for five seconds because you have to let the pressure out somewhere. Tamsin came in halfway through and pretended not to see. She sat on the edge of the table like furniture is a suggestion and I told her in an untidy way about the chest and the machine, and she went quiet in the serious way that is her truest self, and then she said, \u201cNext time I want to stand where you put your hands,\u201d as if wanting could get her a seat on the back step of the future.\n\nMonday the letter from Dalloway, stamped and severe, asked us to attend a meeting where a solicitor with a tie and a parting would try to make memory behave in bullet points. We went because we are people who complain and do the thing anyway. The room was too warm in the old way of rooms that hold their heat like grudges. The woman representing Marwick had the kind of hair that says you can\u2019t afford me, and the woman representing the ex-tenant had shoes that said she would run in them if necessary. We said the things we could stand by; that men who lean are more dangerous than men who shove because leaning is deniable; that doorways are where power collects; that the world is full of hands that think they are accidental. The solicitor tried to find the bit where we would contradict ourselves, and Tamsin smiled the way a person smiles when she knows where your rope runs out. \u201cMy name is not your evidence,\u201d she said, and the woman with the shoes smiled into her water. After, in the cold, I told Dalloway he would look better in a different blue and he laughed like a dog who has learned how to.\n\nWork returned in its coastal way: a freezer van broke at the Waverley and we had to talk a chef out of crying into langoustines; a florist phoned to say his van had been stolen and did we want the flowers anyway, he could throw them from the window; a mother of the bride had decided to wear the same colour as the bridesmaids because she liked how it made her look taller. The week had edges and they didn\u2019t bleed. On Wednesday the community centre smelled of floor cleaner and resilience and I pressed the chest of a plastic man until the world narrowed and then widened, and Adam told me my counting had improved and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s always the sevens that get me,\u201d and he said, \u201cMe too,\u201d and we looked at each other like we had known that all along.\n\nBy the second Saturday of February the starlings were free with their rehearsals and people who didn\u2019t usually look up remembered they had necks for it. The cold was kinder, the light less stingy. Tamsin got a call she took in the tiny garden she insists her flat has, and when she came back in she had a face like she had bitten into something sharp and wanted more. \u201cThey want to interview me,\u201d she said, failing to pretend disinterest. \u201cThe ambulance people. For the zero-to-hero thing. They say I could be a care assistant in six months if I promise not to shout at old men for being old. I told them I can promise to shout behind my teeth.\u201d She looked at me like someone had handed her a map to a place she\u2019d drawn in her head. I tried to be the right size of proud and managed something close. \u201cDo the uniform and the nights and the tea you forget to drink,\u201d I said. \u201cDo the whole romance. You look good in green.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t flirt with me about trousers,\u201d she said, and hugged me in the lopsided way that means she uses her left shoulder to hold herself up and borrows my right.\n\nMarwick fell silent for a blessed week and it was only later we learned that silence was the sound of a case being prepared. Arthur, from his window, shouted down gossip in bite sizes; that a judge with eyebrows that knew contempt had told Marwick to sit in a chair and listen; that the ex-tenant had an advocate with hands like she was good at tying knots; that the steps now had grit glued into their noses in case men thought they were allowed to slide. Rena said it was a miracle and I said it was paperwork, and she said those are the same thing if you live long enough.\n\nThe observer shifts became a habit of sorts. I learned the voice the radio uses when it\u2019s lying about distance. I learned which puddles on Eastern Road are deeper than they pretend. I learned what time the city\u2019s drunkest men become sweet and how to stand so a frightened child sees you before she sees her mother seeing her. There were nights without red and nights when a glass in a kitchen cut a hand and the kitchen turned into a theatre and I looked at the floorboards and described the grain. There was a call to a boy who had decided knives are for solving maths and lost the argument with his own skin. The blood was articulate in the way teenage mistakes are. I breathed and did not run, which feels like a poor boast until you can\u2019t boast it. I learned the smell of adrenaline in other people and in myself, how it tastes like pennies and old keys. I learned that some men cry when told they are not dying, and some laugh when told they might have to, and both deserve tea.\n\nThe third time the pager bossed me during a wedding, Tamsin told the registrar we were on an emergency and the registrar rolled his eyes and said, \u201cAlways,\u201d and I ran down the steps of the registry office like the world had given me a deadline. A woman had fainted in the lobby and knocked her head against the radiator in a performance my nightmares have tried to own for years. The radiator did its comic clank, the kind that says it never wanted to be involved. The cut was small and mouthy. I sat with my back against the wall and told her about the weather as if weather could sutures. I put a pad where pads go and pressed and watched the vein in her neck be steady under her skin. Tamsin fetched a plaster that had a cartoon animal on it because that is what they keep for children and adults who need lies. The woman\u2019s eye made a shape that meant she was back enough to be embarrassed. \u201cI\u2019ve always been dramatic,\u201d she said, and I said, \u201cNo, me,\u201d and we had a small contest about who had caused more trouble for strangers. When Adam arrived he brought the smell of motion with him and nodded as if he was proud in the quiet way men have built for not being caught at it. Later Tamsin told me she had found me looking directly at the colour and not folding, and I put that in the drawer in my head where I had kept all the times I had failed, and for company I left it there with this better picture.\n\nWhen Tamsin went to her interview she wore black and laughed at herself for it. She came out with a smile that was all gums and bones. \u201cThey asked me how I handle stress and I told them weddings,\u201d she said. \u201cThey asked me if I had any weaknesses and I said a tendency to speak in complete sentences, and the woman with the highlighter laughed like a drain. They said my references use words like force of nature, which I\u2019m choosing to take as flattery. They said there will be a fitness test that is mostly carrying things up stairs, and I told them stairs and I have an understanding.\u201d We went to the Common to tell the water about it and the water was busy but allowed us a look. A boy was trying to fly a kite that did not want to work and his father was pretending he had known all along this was a terrible plan, and Tamsin shouted helpful lies about angles and the wind took pity on the child and made a play for the sky.\n\nThere are things I still can\u2019t do. There are days I cannot make myself go into the aisle with the raw meat. There are mornings when the memory of the bus stop tastes like metal and I throw the duvet over my head and declare a private state of emergency. There are afternoons when a red thread on a stranger\u2019s sleeve is enough to thin the air, and I go and stand in the garden of the pub and count the holes in the fence until my lungs remember how. But there are also nights where a man\u2019s heart stops pretending and I put the heel of my hand on his other truth and do not fall. There are Wednesdays where we stand in a circle and do the counting together and each seven is a kind of prayer I have learned to say without believing in anything more than breath. There are Saturdays where a bride\u2019s grandfather falls asleep in the disabled loo and I talk him awake without making him into a joke, and he tells me about Sicily in 1944 and we both pretend the present is a small room we can exit any time.\n\nIn March, when the daffodils did their loose coins routine on roundabouts and the town forgave itself for a winter of mould, a letter came for me that did not sulk. This one had a confidence to it, the NHS crest in a mood you could have a drink with. It said there was a place on a course, a real one, the kind with whole breaths and shifts attached, an introduction to being the voice that travels with the kit. It told me the days and the hours and the rooms it would need me in. It told me there would be a uniform at the end if I didn\u2019t embarrass anyone. It told me to bring my own pen. I showed it to the kettle in case I\u2019d misread it, and the kettle clicked like a tongue and turned itself on, and I took that as endorsement. I took it to Rena who pretended to be unimpressed so she could be more impressed, and I took it to Tamsin who held the paper like it was a small animal and tried not to squeeze. \u201cLook at us,\u201d she said, \u201cbeing useful on purpose.\u201d\n\nWe went to the sea because the sea has been forced to listen to everything else. The wind had become almost polite and the gulls were out on a union break. The Spinnaker looked like a skewer for sky. We sat on the wall with chips we pretended were not supper and talked about trousers and shifts and the smell of ambulance interior in summer, and she told me she had been offered a start date that didn\u2019t make sense with weddings, and she would have to choose the sort of chaos she wanted, and I told her to choose the one that lets her sleep three hours and wake up proud rather than eight and wake up bored, and she told me I had no business sounding wise with salt on my chin. A boy ran on the stones until one of them betrayed his ankle and fell and did the thing children do where they look for permission to cry, and we both waved at his mother like satellites. We talked about Rena\u2019s knees, which had decided to be less angry because attention had been paid, and we talked about Kai\u2019s plant, which was thriving after he had stopped informing it of the news.\n\nIf there is a point to any of this, it is not one you can write on a banner and take to a march. It is in the small repetition of showing up. It is in the way the kettle permits the day with steam, and the way the gulls insist the bins are theirs, and the way the stairs remember their job if you don\u2019t let them forget. It is in the difference between a town that pretends not to need you and a town that admits it misses you when you\u2019re not on the wall where you sit to watch the water turn iron into light. It is in the phrase I am here, which is nothing and everything, which is not a saint\u2019s vow or a politician\u2019s promise, which is the sort of thing you can say to a bleeding child or a complaining drunk or a woman who has done her own heroics and wants you to notice. It is in the moments where you get to say it to yourself in a mirror above a sink that was never intended for drama and believe it a fraction longer than last time. It is in the fact that when the pager rattles its insect rattle and my body disobeys me and goes towards something red, Tamsin texts a fish and a knife and then an umbrella, and Rena sets out cups without asking, and Adam raises an eyebrow that means both courage and tea. It is, I think, in the fact that the sea ignores us and makes us better anyway, and we keep telling it our plans because we are ridiculous like that and we have to be.",

                              "content": "By the time the acceptance email turned into a timetable and a badge you could clip on without laughing, the town had remembered how to be late winter. The wind went through us instead of around us and the sun had learned to be patient in a way that looked like faith. The course lived in a building that used to be a school and now pretended to be a hospital on weekends; there were posters of lungs smiling and diagrams of hearts that looked like shame. We sat at tables that had carved names from the eighties and the tutor was a woman with hair like a helmet who said, \u201cYou will not be heroes here. You will be competent. Heroes get in the way. Competence makes it home for tea.\u201d She made us stick pads on mannequins until the mannequins looked like they were auditioning for a low-budget science fiction, and she timed our stairs like she was charging rent at each landing.\n\nI had told myself the stairs would be the test and then the stairs took that personally. Four flights in a building that had learned mildew like a second language, carrying a folded chair that knew it could humiliate you, with a stopwatch clicking like a polite gun. The first flight was joke-easy; the second thought about knees; the third tasted like pennies in my mouth; the fourth refused to be bribed. On the landing between two and three, Tamsin\u2019s face appeared in the little window because she had finished paperwork early and couldn\u2019t pretend not to watch. She did not cheer. She put her thumb up and then down and then left and then right, and I kept going because this is what you do for people who take the mick without making you small. At the top the tutor made a note that might have been You didn\u2019t die, and I stood there with my hands on my thighs and looked at the skirting board until my lungs believed me.\n\nWe learned the inventory by touch in the way of magicians, reaching into bags to pull out triangular bandages and gloves with equal solemnity. We learned to talk to radios like we respected them but did not fear them, which is a voice I have never had for men. We learned how to tell the difference between someone who couldn\u2019t breathe and someone who had forgotten how, and the tutor pursed her mouth at us until we stopped lying to ourselves about which was which. On day four a man came from fleet operations and gave us a talk about seat belts in a tone that suggested he had buried more idiots than friends, and then he told a joke that made me like him even as I promised not to be the punchline. By the end of the week my notebook looked like a page out of a drunk bird\u2019s diary and I could put a cuff on without making it into a threat.\n\nIn the evenings, the city did the honest work of putting itself away and we did the same to our bodies. I would walk back along the front because walking back along the front has always been my compromise with sanity, and the water would practice being silver while the wind negotiated with gulls over who owns the air. Tamsin would meet me with her hair up and her, \u201cWhat did you break,\u201d and I would tell her about the man who came to teach us lifting and how his spine made a sermon out of not using your back like a hero. She had her own timetable now, three days a week in green at the care home on Milton Road where the corridors are carpet and the light is a fight, and two days telling men at venues that linen is not a personality. She did nights, sometimes, and came out with her mouth thin because old men don\u2019t always want a woman to be the one who sees them small, and then she would soften the mouth for me because I am not the enemy and we would sit in Rena\u2019s and let the quiz tell us we don\u2019t know anything about rivers.\n\nRena tried falling over in February and we vetoed it at the committee stage. It wasn\u2019t one of the big falls; it was a little theatrical stumble in the kitchen that broke nothing and made everything louder. She blamed the rug; the rug blamed gravity; I blamed the lack of sandwiches between breakfast and four. I did the dance with the blood pressure cuff while pretending the cuff was just a puppet we had made for our own amusement, and she tutted as if I had bought the wrong milk. \u201cAll right,\u201d she said, approving only in the way that sounds like contempt. \u201cYou look like you know the shape of my arm. I don\u2019t love that. Bring me water you\u2019ve made important.\u201d We salted the day with small good work and she was herself before the ad break, which is the measure that matters.\n\nDalloway won a thing and behaved about it. The ex-tenant had her day in a room with air that had been filtered for people who can afford it, and the judge got to feel like a father and a guillotine. We weren\u2019t called to speak because there are lawyers who know how to make a morning out of a bruise, but we went anyway, sat at the back as if we were doing back-row church and let the words be done without us. After, on the pavement, Dalloway said, \u201cThank you,\u201d with the particular politeness of men who have discovered their use for you is not a bottomless well, and for once he did not try to collect additional truths like shells. He bought Rena a bun that she pretended not to enjoy and he put money in a charity bucket with unnecessary emphasis and I resisted telling him that money is quieter when it knows what it\u2019s for.\n\nKai moved in with the woman whose mother had the cat and found himself in arguments about spoons that thrilled him. He brought the plant to me on a Wednesday because it was dying under his affection, and I told him to stop misting it like a guilt, to leave it alone for a week and then praise it at odd intervals like a child who isn\u2019t yours. He lay on my sofa and said, \u201cDo you remember when we were sure that the problem with our lives was that nobody would let us? And now people let us and it\u2019s worse,\u201d and I made him a tea he did not drink and told him that letting is only the preface to doing. He has a way of being pleased when I sound like Rena that makes me want to become as old as the kettle on purpose.\n\nThe first big night on the back of a truck as not-nothing came with the moon pretending to be a coin you could spend. Adam had done his bemused face at the rota and Nic had already eaten three biscuits as insurance. They let me sit in the backwards chair and told me to flick the lights on my command like a child being allowed to be the DJ. We did the usuals and the not-quites and then the radio said a word in a tone I had not heard from it before. The word was stabbing and it is a stupid, small word for something that makes air leave a room. It was the kebab shop where men go to decide whether they can live with themselves, the one with the fluorescent that has seen more faces than a mirror.\n\nOn the pavement there was a boy bleeding in the way that makes sense and not sense; it had the pulse of anger rather than arteries and the sharp red of insult rather than exit. You can know this and still have your throat piss about it. The trick is to let your hands be the version of you that has always been better at being here than your head. Nic went straight in like a blade that heals and Adam did that hand-signal ballet I am learning to read, and I took the far side where the boy\u2019s eyes were and made a wall out of my body so he didn\u2019t have the shop window and his own reflection for company. \u201cLook at me,\u201d I said, and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d and I said, \u201cThen look at my stupid vest and tell me why it\u2019s stupid,\u201d and he did, with competence. I described a weather front that had nothing to do with blood; I described a kettle in a kitchen that behaves when you look at it; I described a gull that I swore knew my name, and he calmed by degrees because his mouth had something to do. Tamsin arrived with a napkin she had bullied from a woman who thinks owning a mop is a personality, and she stood by my ear and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not clever but you are useful. Don\u2019t look down,\u201d and I didn\u2019t, and it didn\u2019t kill me.\n\nAfter, sitting on the step behind the shop with the smell of garlic and retreat in my clothes, I shook in the polite way that can pass for cold if you need it to. Nic shoved a biscuit in my mouth without asking because choice is not a tool in every drawer. \u201cYou didn\u2019t sit down,\u201d she said, impressed enough to let it show. \u201cOr you did it on the inside. That counts. You\u2019ll hate this job forever if you\u2019re good at it and you\u2019ll hate it more if you\u2019re not. Find a method and have it ready.\u201d Adam clinked his water bottle against mine like men briefly daring sentiment and told me a story about the first time he bled at work that ended in laughter because he knows that\u2019s how to put the idea back in its box.\n\nWhen we told Rena, she made the face she reserves for when we report danger as if it were gossip. She said, \u201cNo kebab shop in this town deserves your blood,\u201d and then she fed us fish fingers like we were eight and well-behaved. Later she made me take a tin of plasters home \u201cbecause I don\u2019t like the ones they give you; they\u2019re stingy with adhesive,\u201d which is her way of blessing a profession. There is a religion in Rena that has nothing to do with God and everything to do with cupboards. If she had a cathedral it would smell of chip fat and bravery.\n\nThe day Tamsin got her start date in green she bought the sensible shoes that were promised me and they both looked at me like I was unworthy. She made me put them on and walk up and down her hallway while she clapped as if I were a horse she was pretending to be proud of. \u201cYou look like a man who could carry a chair without making it a sonnet,\u201d she said, and then she looked at my face and softened without meaning to. \u201cYou still write the sonnet,\u201d she added, quieter. \u201cJust don\u2019t do it in the stairwell.\u201d We went to the Common because of course we did and the starlings had brought friends and the sky agreed to be half orange and half the sort of blue that makes old men remember wars they never fought in.\n\nThere are moments when the city joins in on your personal plot and you forgive it its bins. Adam phoned while we were watching the sky be complicated and told me, sounding like someone who had been volunteered, that the paper wanted to do a nothing story about community responders that would be made into something by the number of faces they could line up under a headline. \u201cDo you want your ridiculous mouth under a strapline,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cI am not a headline person,\u201d and he said, \u201cThat\u2019s why you should,\u201d and Tamsin grabbed the phone and said, \u201cHe will, if I can choose the picture,\u201d and Adam sighed like a man who knows he has lost to a principle larger than him and said Wednesday. We turned up to the photo like children told to stand still and be sincere, and the photographer made us do hands in pockets and hands out of pockets and stare off into the middle distance like we could see the future and it had given us permission. Later, the picture made me look like a person who might be helpful if you asked nicely, and Rena cut it out and put it on the fridge with the magnet that says Mind The Gap in case anyone forgot to.\n\nSpring limped into town like a man carrying a sofa by himself, and with it came the wedding season proper. The Waverley had its carpets shampooed into civility and the Dockyard hired an extra man whose sole job was to be yelled at and then admired. We did a ceremony on the pier in a wind that despised hats and the bride\u2019s veil made a play for the sea and I saw Tamsin calculate whether she could jump and be heroic without making it about her. She stayed, which felt like growth. The registrar said, \u201cDo you,\u201d and the couple said, \u201cWe do,\u201d and the sea said, \u201cI am busy,\u201d and I collected glasses with the dignity of a man who was once a poet in his head and now thinks about washing up in a way that could make him cry.\n\nOn a Tuesday, as if my life were a film that had decided to be kind, I bumped into the nurse with the eyebrows from Tamsin\u2019s bus story. It wasn\u2019t the same nurse, of course; the NHS has hundreds of women with eyebrows like anger and mercy, but this one had something of the right shape and the right age and the right contempt for people who make fusses about things that could be solved with a sandwich. She was outside the surgery having an apple like it had personally offended her. I said, \u201cDo you shout people into staying,\u201d and she said, \u201cOnly those who want to go,\u201d and I told her in a sideways way that she had an ancestor who saved someone I love by being unpleasant at the right time. She shrugged as if all she had done today was breathe, and then she told me not to hover near the bins because seagulls have learned faces and I am soft. It felt, walking away, like I had paid an overdue bill.\n\nThere was a call that was only sad. A house where the curtains were the wrong kind of drawn and a man had not woken up in the night, and there was nothing for anyone to do except make the room kinder to the dollop of living left behind. I did the voice and the tea and the find-a-chair-for-the-neighbour and the lies that are almost true. Adam did the paper and the radio and the weighing. Nic did the eyes at the door. The world had the gall to keep being itself and we packed up the smaller pieces of chaos and took them to the next address. That night, in my flat, the kettle didn\u2019t sound enough like doom to be forgiven, and I sat with my back against the cupboard and told the dark I was here and meant it less than usual and then told it again and managed more.\n\nOn the day they gave me my uniform I stood in my kitchen and laughed like an idiot. It is not flattering, the green; it makes you look like a frog that believes in health and safety. It fit me in the way new clothes fit men who have spent years in charity shop trousers, which is to say approximately. I put it on and then took it off because I had forgotten deodorant, then put it on again and caught my reflection in the little mirror over the sink and didn\u2019t hate the man looking back. Rena knocked and then came in without waiting because doors are a fad. She put her hands on my shoulders and said, \u201cLook at you,\u201d as if she had built me from leftovers. \u201cTry not to get famous. It doesn\u2019t suit our kind. You can get a small plaque on a wall one day if you insist, but not more. And bring the jacket back to me when it smells like other people\u2019s houses so I can wash it properly; I don\u2019t trust the powder you buy.\u201d\n\nWhen my first shift in green came up on the rota like a dare, the weather put on its expensive blue. Nic clapped as if we had invented the uniform and Adam cut his finger on a packet of saline and swore with admiration and then let me put a plaster on because symbol. We went out and did the honest things: a child with a marble up his nose who laughed when we made the siren noise with our mouths, a man whose dog had eaten his medication and required a lecture more than intervention, a woman who had mistaken the jitters for doom and apologised to us with cake. The radio said a word about a boat and my stomach tried to take a different bus and I ignored it. We were turned away halfway by a second crew more near, which is how the universe spares you some days.\n\nThere was a call near the Guildhall where a woman had cut her hand trying to dislodge a stubborn jar lid with a knife, which is a behaviour that should have a museum. She sat on her kitchen floor making the small moans you make when you have betrayed yourself, and the red was there, obviously, because knives like to make statements, and I felt my throat try the old trick and I breathed in the way the poster says to and I kept my eyes on the pattern of the lino in front of me. We joked about jam being a hate crime and I asked her to tell me about what she was making as if the menu could stitch her, and Nic had the dressing under control because of course she did. The woman laughed badly and then better and then said, \u201cI don\u2019t like the sight of my own,\u201d as if anybody did, and we made plans for the jar that did not involve metal and she promised to store rage in a different cupboard next time. Walking back to the truck, Adam bumped my shoulder with his in a way that would have knocked me down a year ago and now just set me straight. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go,\u201d he said, and I said, \u201cI wanted to,\u201d and he said, \u201cI always want to. That\u2019s the labour. The trick is to give it no choice.\u201d\n\nTamsin, in green on the days when weddings weren\u2019t paying her to decide what flowers say about a person\u2019s mother, began bringing home stories like stray cats. She told me about a woman who had called because her husband had stopped snoring for a night and she had panicked at the sudden quiet, and how they had sat and made tea and told the silence it was a blessing that didn\u2019t need to be argued with. She told me about a man who refused to let them carry him down the stairs because he said it would be a slight to his father, who had died on his feet, and how she had persuaded him to perform masculinity on the chair with such grace that he had wept on arrival for relief. She told me about a child who put a plaster on Tamsin\u2019s knee after Tamsin tripped over a toy train, very earnest, and told her the plasters work better on grown-ups because grown-ups don\u2019t heal as fast, and I watched her fall a little in love with the idea of being corrected by toddlers.\n\nOne thin morning we found Arthur in the courtyard under the new steps, intact, arguing with a woman about the proper greeting for a neighbour you do not like. He nodded at me with the proprietorial air of a man who believes he invented gravity because he lost a fight with it once. \u201cThey\u2019re better,\u201d he said, jerking his chin at the stairs, and I said, \u201cYou sound disappointed,\u201d and he said, \u201cI prefer a world with hazards; keeps the young interesting,\u201d and I did not tell him that the world will provide hazard without his curating it. He told me he had tried to imagine me in green and had failed and I said, \u201cMe too,\u201d and he laughed in a way that didn\u2019t make me want to sit down.\n\nAdam took me to the river where the ambulances rest between bad decisions and showed me a heron who spends afternoons pretending to be a stick. \u201cHe\u2019s my favourite colleague,\u201d he said. \u201cHe never radios in for back-up. He never writes a report longer than necessary. He is late to everything and nobody minds.\u201d We were quiet for a long time, watching the bird stand, and then Adam said, casually enough to be rehearsal, \u201cWhen people die on my watch, sometimes I make tea wrong for a week on purpose and let it punish me. Then I stop. That\u2019s the whole ritual. You\u2019ll need one.\u201d I told him I already had the kettle in my house trained to be a confessor and he said, \u201cGood. Don\u2019t teach it Latin. It\u2019ll get ideas.\u201d\n\nWe went to a call in a shop where a boy had cut his scalp on a corner of a shelf because he had been running away from responsibility in the shape of a manager. Head wounds perform; they always have. There was a lot of red and I felt the familiar tilt and I did my work anyway. The boy was fine, mostly hair and theatre, but the colour did the tap dance behind my eyes and I had a second where the world went down a corridor I didn\u2019t want. Nic said my name in the tone you use for men who have wandered off in supermarkets, and I came back, and I looked at the boy\u2019s shoes because shoes are for knowing people without their blood, and I told him about the time I tried to work at a fish place and my boss told me to never drop a crab because a crab bears grudges, and he laughed his own blood off his face and asked me if I was making that up and I told him I never had to make up anything with claws.\n\nThere is a peace to the end of shift that feels like theft. You step back into the station with the taste of other people\u2019s kitchens in your throat and you hang up your jacket like it has sinned. Nic took her hair down in one movement that felt like watching a kite come home and Adam washed a mug like it had tried to betray him and the radio clicked its tongue and let us go. I cycled home in the dark because bikes and I have an uneasy truce, and the Common looked like a sheet laid over the city by someone with bad folding. The foghorn did its single long note that always finds me, and I said my small superstition into my scarf like a man making weather. I am here. It\u2019s a simple sentence that keeps meeting new rooms.\n\nIn May the city pretends to be a different country for a week and we all humour it. The fronts fill with men who think shorts are politics, and the ice cream van becomes a religion, and the pier is discussed as if it will always be there. Tamsin worked a wedding on the little strip of beach near the Canoe Lake where dogs feel superior, and I held a baby with the solemnity of a judge while the mother adjusted a bodice that hated her, and the baby\u2019s eyes did the old soul trick that makes you believe in reincarnation while you\u2019re holding a biscuit. The bride\u2019s father gave a speech about how he had wanted his daughter to marry someone who would teach her to be late less, and the groom pointed at his watch with a grin that made me briefly generous towards men. After, by the bins that smell of fish and redemption, Tamsin leaned her head on my shoulder like a cat who is resting because the flight to attack will be resumed shortly. \u201cWe\u2019re building something that isn\u2019t a wall,\u201d she said, almost annoyed by her own sentiment, and I said, \u201cA jetty,\u201d and she said, \u201cDon\u2019t get maritime on me,\u201d and then she kissed me on the corner of my mouth in a way that could be explained away by both of us later, which we did not.\n\nIf chaptering is a habit, then this felt like the one where the author takes a breath and lets people make tea. Dalloway didn\u2019t call because he was busy with a sinkhole, which is not a metaphor; the Council had found itself with a literal hole and nobody wanted to own it. Kai sent me a photo of the plant surviving and his face beside it like a before and after, and I told him to stop congratulating the plant and start informing it of rent. Rena baked a traybake she refused to name and foisted half on the neighbour she sometimes loathes and sometimes loves, and I watched her invent community with pastry because that is the only way it sticks in this town. Adam cried at a stupid advert for a bank and pretended he had something in his eye, and I pretended to believe him because that is friendship.\n\nThe stairs in my head were dustier. They still arrive when I am not being careful, and the scarf is still red, and the sound is still fully itself, but the scene has been interrupted often enough now by a kettle or a pager or a woman with eyebrows that refuse death that it has lost its monopoly. When they come, I sometimes imagine Tamsin on the landing putting her hand through the glass and making faces, and in that imagining the sound is not the last word, just a note in a song I am learning to hum without being sick. It is not healing. It is not a cure. It is a practice. It is a way of letting the city\u2019s noise teach me a tune I can use elsewhere.\n\nOne night we went to the seafront for our own reasons and found the sky had decided to show off, a red that had taken anger and turned it into permission. People took photographs like they were proof, and a man proposed to a woman with a ring that the gulls approved, and three teenagers tried to get a barbecue to confess it was a bad idea and failed. We stood with chips and vinegar and the wind telling us we would regret this and didn\u2019t, and Tamsin said, \u201cI thought living was going to be a bigger thing,\u201d and I said, \u201cIt is; you\u2019re just inside it,\u201d and she put her hand in my pocket and left it there because some questions are answered by lazy anatomy. The water did its show and then went back to being itself, and that is the lesson I want for us. We can be everything for a minute and then we can be ordinary and it will not mean we are less.\n\nOn the way home we passed the steps where Arthur fell and where the tape once sagged like hope before becoming work, and there was a girl sitting halfway down, the age where the world is a mirror with fingerprints. She had her knees up and her face hidden in that way that says, leave or try, and Tamsin, who bargains with heaven without believing in it, said, \u201cTea,\u201d like a prayer. We sat three stairs down so she didn\u2019t have to look down to look at us and we listened and didn\u2019t make it about us. It was not a drama you could sell; it was a father who had used his voice badly and a mother who had used her silence worse and a school that had marks and no memory. We gave her the number for someone who answers phones without sighing and we told her she could always come and be bored at Rena\u2019s on quiz night because boredom can be a medicine, and she almost smiled, which is a currency I am learning to respect. When we left, the steps looked less like a machine for correction and more like a place to sit, which is all I ever wanted for them.\n\nIf you ask me what chapter ten is about, I might say it\u2019s the one where the shoes fit without needing to apologise. It\u2019s the one where \u201cI am here\u201d started to be true in rooms I didn\u2019t choose and the rooms did not throw me out. It\u2019s the one where Tamsin found a green that looked like audacity on her and wore it to make men be quiet in hallways. It\u2019s the one where Rena sat at her table and said grace without naming anyone and meant it with crumbs on her lip. It\u2019s the one where the city didn\u2019t soften so much as agree to coexist, and the gulls stopped being a metaphor and went back to being thieves, and the sea pretended to be impressed with us for an evening and then got on with the old work. It\u2019s the one where, at the end, I stood at my sink with the mirror that never lies and told it out loud again and heard the sentence put on a bit of weight. I am here. It still felt like an exaggeration. It also felt like a plan.",
