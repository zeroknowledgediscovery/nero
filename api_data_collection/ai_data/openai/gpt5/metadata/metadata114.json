     "novel_text": "The first time Nico Fawcett watched a silverback in a pinstripe suit slam a gavel, he was elbow-deep in a drain that was older than the company itself. He had turned the handle on his torch so it spat a plane of light, white and hot, into a rusted throat of welded bends. Bleach ghosted the air. Water fretted around his forearms, warm and resentful, as if the building begrudged him for knowing its secret. From the grate below his boots he could hear the monkey board\u2019s voices, overlapping with a rain of knuckles on polished teak.\n\n\u201cMotion. Motion,\u201d grunted the silverback, whose portfolio included something like Nutrient Futures and also, according to rumor, the underground distribution of laughter at investor breakfasts. \u201cWe do not entertain motions that involve extra nap times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not,\u201d repeated the orangutan CEO in a tone that says we, we, we until the pronoun turned into a leash. He lounged under a chandelier, one long arm propped on a stack of legal pads. A red scarf hugged his throat; his tie pin was a miniature banana encrusted with diamonds arranged in a swirl that had cost three interns their annual holiday stipends.\n\nA capuchin in a midnight blazer leafed through a prospectus larger than herself. The pages made a sound like a money river. \u201cNevertheless,\u201d she said, flicking a sticky note with earnest precision, \u201cwe\u2019re under pressure. The city wants our help with the Sidekick Compliance Plan.\u201d\n\nThe word dropped into the room like a cereal box clinking onto a tile floor. Sidekick. You heard it everywhere, like birdsong and sirens and the hiss of the espresso machine in the lobby where an attendant in a bow tie shaved soft rolls of chocolate onto cappuccinos for the board when they needed to sharpen their thinking. Sidekick. The world had turned what used to be a friend who shows up too late to mop blood off the sidewalk into a title. It had a card. It had a lanyard. It had a low-budget jingle.\n\nNico unlatched a second length of pipe, his wrench making a blunt, pleasant sound. He had been plumbing for the better part of a decade and learned to tell what made a building clear its throat. There were the clogs that came from executives flushing contracts they regretted\u2014soggy vowels and consonants gumming the U-bend\u2014and there were the banana peels that had grown into shapes like questions. The bananas fell into two categories, bros. He could tell by the oil on the skin if they were imported from the consortium plantations run by squirrel monkeys out in the archipelago or if they were Black Stripers, the fancy kind with built-in vanilla notes. Today they were the fancy kind. The kind that clung to the metal like old opinions.\n\nHe listened to the meeting through the floor because he had no taste for radio preaching. The drains were as good as any station. He could hear them discuss tax holidays in a dialect of lawyers and tail-thumps. He could hear a subordinate sneeze and be reprimanded for violating the rhythm. His elbows got wetter.\n\n\u201cSidekicks are for show,\u201d said a young proboscis monkey in sales who had the ruinous good looks of a person destined to get demoted twice and then bounce back into consultancy. \u201cThe Important Crime-Fighting Act specifies they can\u2019t act alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one acts alone,\u201d the orangutan sighed. \u201cThat is the point of the act. The point is compliance. The point is that the public sleeps knowing only world leaders wield sidekicks, and world leaders never sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey nap,\u201d the capuchin said, and the room tipped into laughter that put teeth on display. Apes think you can\u2019t tell what they\u2019re thinking, but when they smile their grief shows through, quick as a coin flash.\n\nNico\u2019s wrench slipped and sang against a bolt. He thought: sidekicks, sidekicks, sidekicks. It was in his head every morning, the way cold water knows where your bones are thin. The city of Brasshaven had turned all of it into a system\u2014anything worth loving into a system eventually. If you wanted to fight crime in Brasshaven, you had to do it through the program. If you wanted a sidekick\u2014and you did, because a lone vigilante got laughed into perjury\u2014you had to be assigned one by the Sidekick Bureau. And the Sidekick Bureau served only one office: the Keeper of the World, a position mostly ceremonial if you believed the posters, mostly tyrannical if you listened to the late-night pirate podcasts, and mostly mysterious if you listened to no one but the river. World leader. Sidekick. The law braided the two into something like a leash. The entire arrangement was supposed to stop gangsters building brand identities and politicians cutting deals with heroes. It did none of that. So far, it had created a very lucrative chain of consulting firms that advised mayors on cape-management.\n\nHe twisted and pulled, and the blockage surrendered a little with a sound like a sigh.\n\n\u201cCareful, Mr. Fawcett.\u201d\n\nThe voice floated down through reflected gold. Nico recognized it: the voice belonged to a chimpanzee he only knew as Chortle, Head of Corporate Communications at Peel & Prosper International, owner of seventeen identical blue suits, ringmaster of band-aid solutions. Chortle leaned down through the hole the company had carved into the floor to accommodate an emergency maintenance shaft and grinned, teeth very white, very straight. He had a tin of candied ants in one hand. He popped one. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have press down there in twenty. The pipes cannot be weeping like my uncle at tax time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll hold.\u201d Nico brushed a thread of lime scale from his sleeve. \u201cYour problem is second-floor fun. You\u2019ve got too much peel in your churn.\u201d\n\nChortle peered at his reflection in the wrench and took a second to consider a rebuttal, which he decided against because he liked sounding as if he didn\u2019t touch actual objects. \u201cIf you could\u2026 align the situation with a timeline that suits the narrative, we\u2019d be grateful.\u201d\n\nNico nodded. Align. He thought of his grandmother\u2019s old fridge, with its humming that grew startlingly loud at three a.m., as if the metal had decided domesticity was not enough and it would rattle itself to the moon. He thought of the little note she\u2019d left that morning propped up against the bag of day-old buns she\u2019d wrapped for him in a newspaper comic: Don\u2019t forget, Thursday is Wasp Day. It was never Wasp Day. She said a lot of things that weren\u2019t true and half of them came true by accident anyway.\n\nHe took the rag from his pocket and wiped a line of clean on the pipe, then ran his hand along it, feeling for grit. Plumbing teaches you to read with fingers. It had been six months since he\u2019d been fired from the city water authority for telling the deputy director that the magical thinking around budget shortfalls should be taken to an actual magician. Since then he\u2019d freelanced for whoever called him at odd hours, and everyone did, because pipes did not read calendars. He had become, by accident, intimate with brass and porcelain in the offices where monkeys ran things. They paid in a currency that sometimes looked like money and sometimes looked like a helping hand you\u2019d better not take. He took the first. He took the second never. When cash was tight, he took bananas and resold them to human bakeries that made indulgent cream pies labeled with the helpful lie of artisanal provenance.\n\n\u201cDo you ever,\u201d a voice said softly, \u201cget tired of repairing the same messes the same way?\u201d\n\nNico looked up, blinking; his torch flicked. The question had a warmth that did not belong to the board. It belonged to someone who wasn\u2019t allowed in the room and got in anyway. He saw the speaker above the hole: a human woman with hair like a waterfall when the water\u2019s tired. She wore an orange maintenance vest like his, but the stripe on hers was blue, and two little metal discs with the Bureau\u2019s crest winked from her collar. Sidekick Bureau. She had a pen behind her ear. She had a smudge of oil high on her cheekbone in a place you leave it on purpose.\n\n\u201cNot your problem, Bureau,\u201d he said mildly, because you get in less trouble when you sound precise.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s my problem,\u201d she replied, not without cheer. \u201cToday even your pipes are my problem because our new protocol says we can\u2019t deploy a junior assignment to any building with\u2014\u201d she consulted a card \u201c\u2014Category Three infrastructure deficiency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Category Two,\u201d he said, scandalized on behalf of pipes he would never admit he loved. \u201cMaybe Two-and-a-half if you count the executive washroom sauna, which I do, because we\u2019ve all seen the drain after somebody brings in a tray of iced eclairs.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Lara Quill. Liaison. You\u2019re Nico Fawcett. Your grandmother terrifies and charms two of my aunts.\u201d\n\nHe wiped his hand on his pants and, feeling the unexpected itch of wanting to be impressive, shook. \u201cShe terrifies me, too.\u201d\n\nLara glanced over her shoulder. Behind her the board had stopped pretending not to watch the two humans. The orangutan\u2019s red scarf flashed like a warning. Chortle waved his tin of sugared ants at an assistant, and Nico watched a banana peel arc into a bin with the mathematical inevitability of rainfall. Lara leaned in. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a recruitment push.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor criminals?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor sidekicks. We\u2019re always short. The application form is new this quarter and has fewer opportunities to accidentally enroll a ferret. We require new pairings at the very top because that trickles down. Our mandate says: \u2018All heroes shall be assigned a sidekick by a world leader in accordance with the Charter.\u2019 You want to help? Become a world leader.\u201d\n\nIt came out like a joke and muscled into the room like a declaration. A golden bead of water fell from the pipe onto Nico\u2019s wrist and became a cold coin against his veins. He pictured himself on one of the sad billboards by the river where the candidates for Keeper of the World smiled teeth they had whitened on a payment plan. The last Keeper had been a mercurial rhesus with a taste for mango chutney and life coaches. She\u2019d resigned on live television when a baby howler monkey climbed onto the set and took a nap in her shoe.\n\n\u201cI fix sinks,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t keep worlds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read your fines,\u201d Lara said, which was not a flirtation in any language, but to be fair Nico spoke several kinds of sarcasm. \u201cI\u2019ve read the case you made to the municipal inspector about the copper theft ring that ran under the old tram line.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody had to make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake this.\u201d She flicked a card at him; it thwacked against his chest and stuck momentarily to the damp fabric. \u201cApplications open for the interim Keeper\u2019s seat. You can\u2019t assign a sidekick unless you hold it. You want crime to stop happening to people without money? Run. If you do it and win, we\u2019ll assign your sidekick. Day one. You can pick from the top shelf. Not that there\u2019s really a shelf. It\u2019s more\u2026 a spreadsheet with drops of coffee on it.\u201d\n\nShe moved away before he\u2019d decided on a sneer or a snort. Chortle descended into the maintenance space with an acrobat\u2019s grace, pinstripes unruffled, as if chimp anatomy had been redesigned by a tailor. \u201cWe\u2019re having a launch,\u201d he told the air. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of our new product.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeeled water?\u201d Nico said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling it WorldStart.\u201d Chortle\u2019s eyebrows, which were not technically eyebrows, lifted with an earnestness that would have been more impressive if he had not spent last month convincing the city that banana disposal fees were a museum grant-worthy cultural expression. \u201cIt\u2019s a program that helps world leaders succeed. Workshops. Retreats. Guided vision. Yoga with higher fiber. We\u2019re interviewing candidates. Every candidate gets a complementary\u2014complimentary? Both!\u2014sidekick assignment from the Bureau if they wish to look\u2026 robust. Photogenic.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a pair of pears,\u201d Nico said, irritated that he enjoyed his own metaphor. He thought of Lara\u2019s smudge of oil. He thought of the copper ring he\u2019d exposed by accident because when he lifted a tile to unclog a sink, six thieves popped up like daisies and tried to shove him back down. He thought of his grandmother\u2019s note about Wasp Day and how she once made a cake that was really a hat. \u201cI\u2019ll consider it,\u201d he lied in the tone of a man who has already put the card into his left pocket where the lining has a hole so things fall into the inside of the jacket and you find them years later and feel a grief you can\u2019t name.\n\nBy the time he finished, two hours later, the water had cooled and what had been a clog was only a memory of stubbornness. He reassembled the pipe and stood up slow, feeling the joints in his shoulders sing. Chortle clapped. The board clapped. They clapped like people who had only ever read about applause. Nico took his envelope\u2014heavy with the right kind of currency and a voucher for a smoothie he would never redeem because the attendant always looked at him like a plumber had not earned blueberries\u2014and left through a side door that felt like an apology.\n\nOutside, Brasshaven was the color of late-day metal. Buildings pushed into the sky like stubborn fruit. Monkeys haggled in alleyways over the price of gossip. Humans banged pots to keep pigeons from taking root in their hearts. Somewhere a busker played a harmonica so sadly even the lampposts leaned in. Nico\u2019s van, which had once been white and now possessed the color of a foggy rumor, dozed under a meter that said NO NEED TO PAY IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, which a street artist had stenciled on six months ago and no one had bothered to remove because self-belief boosted local commerce.\n\nHe slotted the envelope under the seat with the others and drove the long way home through the Old Quarter, past the bakery where sugar lived as a philosophy, past the bar with the ceiling fans like tired angels, past the statue of the first Keeper of the World, a macaque with a thoughtful gaze and shoes that didn\u2019t fit because the sculptor loved the idea of discomfort eternally poised. In front of the statue, a group of protestors shook signs that said THE WORLD IS NOT A SINGLE THING; DO NOT TRY TO KEEP IT and IN MY DAY HEROES JUST WORE HATS.\n\nHis apartment sat above a tea shop that sold leaves at prices you only spent when you had just done something that made you feel like you might be a better version of yourself next week. The shopkeeper, Mr. Chi, nodded as Nico passed, and slid a bag of the cheap stuff into his hand as if exchanging contraband. \u201cFor the grandmother,\u201d Mr. Chi murmured, eyes lighted with the kindliness of a person who knows the uses of a kettle at three a.m.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nico said, because you must accept small kindnesses or the big ones forget where to find you.\n\nHe unlocked two doors, turned his shoulder against the third, and stepped into his room. The window\u2019s view embraced a wall and a sliver of sky. Plants orphaned from long-ago attempts at optimism drooped from a shelf. On the table a small machine ticked; his grandmother had left it there last winter with a note that said for emergencies, and when he asked what kind, she had said the kind that involve jam, which did not clarify much. The machine had levers. It had a crank. It once spit out an egg.\n\nThe smell of something sweet greeted him like a hand to the back of his neck. He paused. He listened. \u201cGranny?\u201d he said, not loudly.\n\n\u201cNot my name.\u201d The voice that answered from the kitchen had laughter trapped in it. \u201cI am Madame Viper. I have stolen your jam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who ate all the fig biscuits,\u201d he said, leaning in the doorway.\n\nHis grandmother stood on a stool wearing a floral dress that had belonged to somebody flamboyant in 1961 and never apologized. She was frosting a tower of cupcakes that leaned like a decision. The frosting was lime green. She wore it on one knuckle. She had white hair in a complicated bun that looked like something a pastry should aspire to.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said. \u201cI made you a cake. To wear as a hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I know. Wasp Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did remember.\u201d She lifted a cupcake and placed it carefully on the very top of the tower, which sighed but did not fall. \u201cIf you don\u2019t celebrate Wasp Day, they\u2019ll get offended and never sting you again. And then where would you be? I heard you were inside Peel & Prosper. Did you look them straight in their tiny, blinking souls? Did you show them you knew where the water went?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did. They are very attached to their peels.\u201d He slung his vest over a chair and stretched until his shoulders cracked. \u201cA woman from the Sidekick Bureau told me to become a world leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh good,\u201d his grandmother said, unperturbed. She hopped off the stool and moved with the kind of agility that made him remember she had taught him to climb trees and also fences and also silence. \u201cI signed you up.\u201d\n\nHe stared. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d She opened a drawer, removed a packet of candles, and fanned them like cards. \u201cYou always say you want to fix more than sinks. You always say the real blockage is violence with nice shoes on. So. I took the liberty of filing the preliminary papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d He felt the room tilt very slightly. The wall with the sliver of sky leaned closer as if wanting to hear gossip. \u201cGranny Nell, you can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI did. It was all online. There were three captchas and one asked me to select squares that contained a car, which I correctly identified as trucks to be contrary. The page broke. I pressed back. A monkey in a chat window told me to be resilient.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hate online forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue. Which is why I made Mrs. Chi\u2019s granddaughter do it. She is twelve. She knows what to click.\u201d She studied his face and then softened, as if the muscles around her eyes let go of something they had held. \u201cYou\u2019re not obliged. But you could. You could be Keeper. Or you could\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014hurl myself into a ravine,\u201d he suggested.\n\n\u201cYes, but then we\u2019d have to fish you out and all our cold-weather clothes would smell like ravines. Put a candle in this cupcake. It\u2019s not your birthday but it is your Tuesday.\u201d\n\nHe watched her, feeling that familiar twin: irritation as a fringe around awe. She had raised him on a small pension and a cupboard that always had exactly one jar of something interesting. It had been only the two of them since he was seven and the only picture he had of his parents was the one his grandmother refused to be ashamed of, which showed two young people with large ideas leaning against a boxy car painted daisy yellow. Every year on the day they drove away not coming back, his grandmother said, \u201cThey were ridiculous and brave,\u201d and they ate soup on the floor. She did not give speeches about fate. She gave speeches about lunch and how you should never close jars too tight because sometimes jars need to breathe.\n\nHe lit the candle because it was wise to do what she asked when the request was ridiculous. They ate sugar. She told him the story of the first time she\u2019d voted for Keeper, which involved a broken heel, a thunderstorm, and the late arrival of seven parrots who held the line for the polls with their wings.\n\n\u201cYou never tell me,\u201d he said, mouth green from frosting, \u201cwhy the monkeys run the corporations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause someone has to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because when the chimps got the hang of jackets, everyone went soft. The monkeys were already organized for stealing mangoes from the market. It wasn\u2019t hard to pivot to derivatives. People like to watch a thing and call it natural.\u201d\n\nHe liked the way she said it, blunt as a hammer. He liked that nothing she said made him feel small for not knowing it first. He looked at the machine with the lever, which ticked up its mind like a clock. He looked at the card the Bureau woman had flicked into his chest. He looked at his hands, lined with someone else\u2019s work. A siren wailed in the distance, cried \u201cno\u201d to the street\u2019s \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to become a poster,\u201d he said, because fear often masquerades as a preference.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said, and patted his cheek with a tenderness that extracted his scowl like a splinter. \u201cYou\u2019re not easy to print.\u201d\n\nThat night, in bed with the window cracked to let in the sound of a city\u2019s arguments, he dreamt of a drain that emptied into the sky. He walked inside the drain. It smelled like lemon and also secrets. The monkeys clapped when he reached the top, not because they were glad to see him but because someone had told them that clapping would keep their hands from finding the truth. He woke with a start because a pigeon landed on his sill and looked in like an editor.\n\nIn the morning, the posters. They had gone up overnight with the unkind speed of glue. Candidates for Keeper of the World smiled tooth-baring smiles so polished they made you feel like a fingerprint. A proboscis in a crisp suit. A human with a jaw that looked engineered. A capuchin in a peach twinset and pearls that were probably the tears of people who had lived through prior administrations. A chimp with a tie that said I made a deal with an ocean. All of them had slogans that were not slogans. STABILITY IS A HELMET. KEEP THE KEEPING. YOU DESERVE MORE. YOU DESERVE LESS. A child had written MOM SAYS DON\u2019T on one with a marker and someone had tried to scrub it away and failed and the ghost of it still showed through: DON\u2019T.\n\nNico bought a paper\u2014habit, ritual, a way to feel like language mattered\u2014and there it was, on the fourth page, under Classifieds: candidates wanted. He found the application link. It took him to a site that said You\u2019re nearly there! and then made him find bicycles in nine squares and then asked him to describe his philosophy of time in 500 words or less, which made him disgusted with whoever had designed the thing and, more dangerously, interested.\n\nHe went to work. A call from a laundromat where the machines had achieved consciousness and expressed it by only accepting coins that had once been lucky; a call from a children\u2019s museum where a pipe had burst in a room labeled The Physics of Innocence and everything smelled like wet sneakers; a call from a restaurant where the ceiling was sweating because a kraken of grease had blossomed in the vent. In each place he did what he did and in each place he found a small stone of anger in himself where once there had been only water wearing away rock. He was tired of mopping up after the wrong kinds of accidents. He was tired of the way the program robbed language until hero meant we asked you to take on our fear for free.\n\nAt lunch he sat on a stoop and ate an egg sandwich he\u2019d wrapped in newspaper and found, balanced on the step beside him, a banana in a suit. A banana in a suit is, of course, a novelty pen handed out at events. This one had the logo of Peel & Prosper on it and when you clicked the top, it squeaked like a comment section. He thought of Chortle, of Lara Quill, of his grandmother\u2019s cupcakes leaning into decision, and he clicked the pen until a passing lemur said, \u201cHave mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, and put the pen in his pocket like a talisman, because sometimes even mockery must be kept for later.\n\nHe printed the application. He took it home. He laid it on the table the way you lay down a map to a place you are not ready to go. His grandmother drifted in behind him like a benevolent weather system.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said, not unkindly.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t decided.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll decide. And then you\u2019ll do it, which is not the same. Don\u2019t confuse deciding with doing. People do. They so do. I once decided to learn the harp.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did. You learned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI learned to carry one. It was full of bees.\u201d She winked, pleased with a history only she would retell that way. \u201cIf you run, we have to get you clothes that stop people\u2019s mouths from swallowing what you say at the hem. If you run, people will throw mud. I will domesticate the mud and make a pie. I will decorate the pie with the word \u2018Hmm.\u2019 If you run\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf, if, if,\u201d he said, not hating the way it sounded like the start of something.\n\nWhen he was a child she had taught him how to sink into the bath and hold his breath until the water was all a hum and no edges. \u201cUnder,\u201d she\u2019d told him when the world shouted. \u201cUnder until it goes quiet. Then up.\u201d He did that now, metaphorically, because a tub would not fit in his van.\n\nHe filled out the form. Name. Address. He wrote his answers to the ridiculous questions with a seriousness he did not owe them. Philosophy of time: I think it runs a little and then sits down. What will you keep of the world if elected: The parts that are tired of being interesting. Describe a moment of courage: I told a man who could fire me that his idea was a hazard and then I fixed it anyway. Do you have allergies: Bees, sometimes, but it depends on if they are in the mood.\n\nHe clicked submit and expected a trumpet or a hole in the floor and he got a tiny, tasteful banner that said Thank you. If you are chosen for interview, a courier will arrive. Please provide biscuits.\n\nHe waited. He didn\u2019t. He went out and ran a snake through a hairball the size of an apology. He went to the market and bought a bag of carrots he would forget to grate. He returned home and found a box on his doorstep with an enormous bow. The bow had its own shadow. The box had a sticker: From the Office of the Interim Keeper, with compliments.\n\nHe put the box on the table next to the jam machine. His grandmother came out of the kitchen wiping her hands on a towel she\u2019d embroidered with the words if no one\u2019s watching, that\u2019s still an audience. They looked at the bow the way you look at an animal you\u2019ve never seen before, with respect and a plan.\n\n\u201cOpen it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou open it.\u201d\n\nShe did not. She touched the edge and the bow sighed, satin against paper. He slid a finger under the lid and paused because his life had contained a reasonable number of bombs and only some of them were literal. He lifted.\n\nInside was an earnest amount of confetti, most of it biodegradable, according to the little slip that had the tone of someone who had learned not to be yelled at on weekends. Resting in the confetti was a pair of shoes. Polished. Brown, the shade of a new idea. Human shoes, size exactly his size. There was also a note:\n\nDear Candidate Fawcett,\n\nCongratulations on your application. The Office of the Keeper believes in wearing shoes that walk forward into conversations. Please accept these. Break them in by arguing with someone you love. Interviews will be conducted on Friday at the World House. Please bring biscuits.\n\nYours in keeping,\n\nThe Interim Keeper\u2019s Office\n\nPS: The Bureau has assigned you a preliminary pre-sidekick for photobacks. This is not binding. Please do not fight crime with the pre-sidekick. That is a violation.\n\n\u201cPre-sidekick,\u201d his grandmother said, rolling the words around in her mouth like toffee, examining their stick. \u201cPhotobacks. Bring biscuits. Oh I will bring biscuits. I will bring biscuits that will make them remove their watches.\u201d\n\nNico tried on the shoes and felt something happen to his calves. He stood taller because the shoes demanded it. He walked to the window and looked out at the sliver of sky, which had somehow not noticed that he had changed footwear. He took them off again because you do not want to get sticky frosting on shoes that are in sentences like \u201cour brand\u2019s forward-facing ambassadors.\u201d He sat. His grandmother went to fetch her good tin.\n\nIn the morning, true to the promise, the pre-sidekick arrived.\n\nShe came on a bicycle that had more chrome than sense. She wore a jacket so yellow it took your breath and gave it back improved. When she removed her helmet, her hair behaved as if being filmed. She leaned her bike against a hydrant as if hydrants were designed for that and climbed the stairs two at a time and knocked in a rhythm that said I know songs.\n\nNico opened. They regarded each other with the mutual suspicion of two people who have both fixed things for other people and discovered it is always the wrong thing. She said, \u201cI\u2019m April. I\u2019m a pre. Please do not take me anywhere with knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d his grandmother trilled from the kitchen, already halfway in love with the event. \u201cWe have biscuits. And cake. And cruel opinions about clothing, which we will not share. Come in. Take off your shoes. Unless you want to keep them on to remind us of upward mobility, in which case keep them on. Biscuits?\u201d\n\nApril laughed, the kind of laugh that put furniture at ease. She took off her shoes because not to would have been unthinkable in that room. She sat where the light was kind to cheekbones. She accepted a biscuit with a little sigh because sugar is an argument you often let win. \u201cI can\u2019t stay long,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a photo at one with eight cats who found helmets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re not being pre,\u201d Nico asked, as if to prove he had not already thought of the way she had placed her hands on the edge of the table as if hands truly belong there.\n\n\u201cLiaison,\u201d she said. \u201cLike my cousin, but with more muffins. I fill out forms. I convince elderly squirrels not to third-party in local elections. I tell very young sidekicks to chew before speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you like it.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him, surprised. \u201cI like parts. I like the parts where I think I\u2019m pouring a little oil into a hinge and the door swings more kindly for someone. I hate the parts with clipboards.\u201d\n\n\u201cClipboards are a plague,\u201d his grandmother said, drumming her fingers on the table in a rhythm that could convince thunderstorms to reschedule.\n\nThey took the photograph. April positioned him in the shoes with the jacket he had not chosen and a tie he would be caught dead in. His grandmother stood behind the camera with ferocious concentration, her tongue peeking out, because taking a good photograph is half intention, half pretending you like the person more than words.\n\nThe picture was bad in a way that made it human. Nico\u2019s hair refused to salute. April\u2019s collar chose rebellion. The light insisted on making a joke about his left ear. When they were done, April took the tiny card from the machine and slid it into the mouth of a tablet that swallowed images chewless. She grinned. \u201cIt\u2019ll look fine on phones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to look fine on a phone,\u201d he muttered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you are not a phone,\u201d his grandmother said, placing a hand on his cheek as if to reassure herself that he was made of exactly what she remembered. \u201cGo. Go to your interview. Take your arguments. Take your shoes. Take my courage. Bring back gossip.\u201d\n\nWhen he left the apartment with the box of biscuits and a heart like a seat he hadn\u2019t sat on yet, he did not know that someone had stuck a sticker on the back bumper of his van that said I BELIEVE IN DRAINS. He did not know that three monkeys in bowling shirts had taken a bet on whether or not his left shoe would squeak under pressure. He did not know that a grandmother in a floral dress had slid into a closet and laughed into her hand, pleased with a joke not yet told, and then gone very still, thinking of something else, a memory he had not asked for yet.\n\nThe World House sits where the river spreads out and becomes almost a lake, a building of white stone and excessive mirrors. It has steps that shall not be climbed while chewing gum. It has doors that open when they like you. The square outside was full of helpful volunteers in matching vests whose matchingness made Nico itch. He recognized the kind of party that was underway. He recognized the distribution of water bottles like absolution. He recognized a man in a suit on a dais saying the word journey twice in one sentence and felt his soul do a small impersonation of sleep.\n\nApril met him by the fountain where somebody had installed two carved fish who never shut up. \u201cYou look like a person who does not want to be here,\u201d she said companionably.\n\n\u201cI look like me,\u201d he said. \u201cIs your job to put people at ease?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cMy job is to know where the muffins are and then to plausibly claim they\u2019ve run out. Come on. They\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nShe guided him through a side entrance where a woman with a clipboard\u2014curse them\u2014checked his name against a list and frowned, then smiled, then frowned again for variety. They walked down a corridor where portraits of past Keepers hung in frames that might as well have had little signs that said Try. He recognized two. He had hated one. April pushed open a door.\n\nInside: three panelists and a plant that was thriving beyond reason. He took a seat. The panelists asked him questions that ranged from what is your first memory to name a policy that reverses a river without breaking the bank. When he answered the first one with Grandma Nell laughing with her mouth full of sunflower seeds, the orangutan on the right said, \u201cWe prefer images with less chewing.\u201d When he answered the second with a half hour of maniacal specifics about topography, drainage canals, and seeds, the capuchin in the center said, \u201cYou\u2019ve thought about this,\u201d surprised as if the application process did not intend to reward thought.\n\nApril stood in the corner and chewed a pencil. Nico talked. He didn\u2019t charm them. He did not perform charm\u2019s tightrope trick. He described a world he wanted to keep in sentences like someone measuring a pipe with both eyes half-closed. He said \u201cplease\u201d exactly once and \u201cno\u201d exactly three times. He tried not to use the word empathy and failed. He said he wanted a sidekick because there are jobs you cannot do alone and we should all get over the romance of it. He said he wanted to fight crime but mostly he wanted to fight being convinced that crime is only what poor people do.\n\nWhen it was over, the capuchin said, \u201cWe will be in touch.\u201d The orangutan said, \u201cDo you have a weakness for pastries.\u201d Nico said, \u201cYes,\u201d automatically, and then, \u201cNo,\u201d automatically, and the capuchin wrote something down that could have been yes or no or both, because sometimes you can see the word and it means its own shadow.\n\nHe stepped outside into light that had decided to be theatrical. The square was a mild chaos of banners and hopefuls and unicycles because there is always at least one unicycle at a civic event. April came out after him and handed him a small gold token in the shape of the World House, which would get him a discount on sandwiches in the vicinity for exactly three days. He wanted to say something scaldingly honest to cut the sweetness of the token and yet he couldn\u2019t. He looked at her, and she looked at him, and in the look was a kind of mutual exhaustion and a small flame.\n\n\u201cYou did well,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI did something,\u201d he said. The fish in the fountain refused to be quiet about it. He put the token in the pocket with the banana pen and felt suddenly burdensome with symbolism. He was going to say goodbye when the interim Keeper, a slender macaque with dark-ringed eyes, stepped up to a microphone and said the joke word that had created the mess they were all standing in.\n\nThe word was Hope.\n\nIt sprayed over the square like bubbles. It slid off most people. It stuck to a few. There was applause. There were cupcakes. There were hats. There was a moment where a small boy with a half-eaten apple looked up at Nico and asked, with a curiosity so ungoverned it hurt, \u201cAre you going to be the person who tells everyone to calm down?\u201d and Nico said, \u201cNo,\u201d and the boy nodded as if reassured that the right answers still existed.\n\nOn his way back to the van, he almost tripped over a crate left on the curb. It was stamped with a stamp that said FRAGILE: WORDS. He looked for a name, found none, hesitated, did not kick it. You don\u2019t kick boxes full of words. You lift them carefully. You carry them home. You open them one letter at a time.\n\nHe drove across the city with the interview breathing in his ear like a dog. He stopped at a light and watched a troop of macaques cross the street in a line with the confidence of inherited offices. A woman in a cloak of peacock feathers distributed fliers that said BECOME UNGOVERNABLE, TODAY ONLY. The light turned green like a dare. He drove on.\n\nAt home his grandmother had rearranged the kitchen and also reality. She had hung a string of paper lanterns that said Congratulations in five languages only one of which had been invented yet. She had made a soup that smelled like comfort and advertised nothing. She listened to his story with her chin in her hand and her eyes on his face as if his words were things she could gather into her lap and keep from rolling under the radiator.\n\n\u201cAre you going to be Keeper,\u201d she asked when he was done.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He waited for her to say you do, because she said that sometimes when he sounded like a bench waiting to be sat on.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll choose someone,\u201d she said. \u201cThey always do. They will choose the one who looks least like a scandal. They will choose the one who looks like a story we can believe in for six months. Make sure you are not in their story unless you want to be.\u201d She reached into her apron pocket and pulled out a small object. A whistle. Silver. She put it in his palm. \u201cIn case you need to make a sound that stops a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you get this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the day your mother was born,\u201d she said, and for the first time that week he saw her look not like a storm, but like its rainbow. \u201cYou were not there. I was. It was loud. And then it wasn\u2019t. You went quiet for too long. And then you yelled. You have always yelled in the precise moments. Keep yelling.\u201d\n\nHe held the whistle because he could not hold her reminders. He put it on a string and wore it under his shirt and it ticked against his heart like the jam machine when it was nervous.\n\nThe call with the decision came at dawn, while pigeons practiced sentences on the sill. The phone rang like a friend. Nico woke from a dream about a blueprint that rearranged itself whenever he blinked. He answered. Lara\u2019s voice. Not April. Lara, the oil-smudged simultaneous apology.\n\n\u201cYou got it,\u201d she said. No preamble. \u201cInterim Keeper for six months. Congratulations, Mr. Fawcett. Pack a toothbrush. We start with an oath. Then lunch. Then seven meetings. Then the part where nothing happens and all of it matters. Bring your\u2026 you.\u201d\n\nHe sat up. He sat all the way up. The room came into focus like a picture agreeing to be seen. His grandmother appeared in the doorway with two cups of tea and the sound of his life arranged into tiny, edible decisions. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. He cried because it was a day to do both. He leaned his head against the wall and felt the paint cool and paintlike under his hair. He thought: a plumber. A city that smells like bananas and ambition. A world that needs keeping like a pipe needs a hand. A rule that says if you want to fight crime, you need a sidekick. A rule that says if you want a sidekick, be a world leader. Fine, then. Fine.\n\nHis grandmother pried open a jar of marmalade. \u201cI will make a hat out of this. And then I will throw it at TV.\u201d\n\nHe dressed. He put on the shoes. He placed the whistle on the string, cool against his chest. He took the banana pen, for luck. He stuck the gold token into his pocket because he wouldn\u2019t be eating lunch if all of this was a prank. He paused in the doorway, turned, saw his grandmother watching him with the expression you sometimes find on saints who are actually very good at practical jokes.\n\n\u201cAnything you\u2019re not telling me,\u201d he asked, for no reason he could name. It came out as a joke. It came out as a question thrown at a wall, expecting to bounce.\n\nShe smiled a smile with ten eras inside it. \u201cOnly that you should eat. And if anyone offers you a smoothie with fiber, throw it over your shoulder.\u201d She patted the machine with the levers. It ticked. It ticked some more. It whirred once, like a bird clearing its throat. \u201cGo on,\u201d she said. \u201cTell the board with the tails that water runs downhill without their approval.\u201d\n\nHe left. The city looked like a person about to laugh at a funeral. The river shined. The monkeys hung from their streetlight perches and traded stock tips. The first of seven meetings waited.\n\nAnd somewhere, high above everything he knew and beneath everything he didn\u2019t, were strings that would, one day, reveal themselves for what they were. Not divine, not cruel, just thin and human and tied in knots with careful, mischievous hands.Chapter 3\n\nThe oath room of the World House was shaped to make promises sound taller than they were. It cupped the sound and poured it back, sugared, so that even muttered clauses acquired a flourish. Chandeliers like the dreams of spiders hung from the ceiling in a geometry that dared you to count. On the dais, a ceremonial lectern squinted at the crowd as if wary of stains, and a carpet the color of patient authority ushered dignitaries toward a rug-cleared center where yesterday\u2019s vows had left a faint heat. A table along the back wall offered refreshments that had opinions\u2014shot glasses of green juice whispering about fiber, delicate stacks of breadless sandwiches held together by ambition, platters of banana slices so artfully fanned they might have been warned not to exhibit subversive circles.\n\nLara met him at the door with a badge that said KEEPER\u2014INTERIM, which she clipped to his lapel as if fastening a kite to a boy. She wore the same sheen of composure she had before, and the same smudge of oil high on her cheekbone like a punctuation, and Nico wanted to wipe it off and then wanted not to, because a sentence that ends in a real dot has more authority than one that ends in a glossy smudge. She steered him past a glass case of ceremonial policy pens, past a display of retired oaths bound in narrow blue books, past a mural that depicted the first Keeper comforting a river with a blanket. It occurred to him that institutions loved their past the way a cookbook loves its photographs.\n\n\u201cYou will repeat after the Moderator,\u201d Lara said, keeping her voice low enough not to be recruited into the anthem. \u201cYou will hold this copy of the Charter, which is heavier than it needs to be. You will say the part about keeping the world and also the part about not weaponizing muffins. There is a clause about sidekicks. Listen careful. They changed the punctuation last winter and one comma now makes you responsible for the verbs of your partner.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does one keep a verb,\u201d he asked, because the room\u2019s earnestness had a way of making sarcasm put on a tie.\n\n\u201cYou will,\u201d she said, entirely sincere and entirely amused, \u201cput it in your pocket, obviously.\u201d\n\nThe anthem rose like steam from a polite kettle. It had the sort of lyrics that looked good printed on tote bags and lost all sense when you read them straight. The Moderator, an owl-faced human in a suit that had outlived two administrations and a divorce, raised a hand. Nico stepped into the clearing. A lens zoomed with the sound of a small, hungry animal. In the second row a porpoise in a wheelchair adjusted her scarf and made the sign of the fish with a fin, which Nico had learned meant both \u201cgood luck\u201d and \u201cdo not be boring.\u201d He took the Charter. He felt the weight settle on his palms and also on his spine and also on a part of his chest that had, for years, only noticed sudden cold.\n\n\u201cRepeat after me,\u201d the Moderator said, and he did, because you can disrespect many things about a ceremony but you should not disrespect a whole room\u2019s desire to hear a certain music. He repeated the clause about tending to the world as if it were a garden infested with opinions. He repeated the clause about sidekicks, which, comma relocated, now made it clear that in the event of an official pairing, the Keeper would neither claim the deeds of the sidekick nor abandon them when the publicity soured. He repeated the clause about keeping his hands off the levers when the levers belonged to other theaters. He said \u201cso keep me\u201d at the end as tradition demanded, and for a second it felt like the room obliged, friendly as water.\n\nThe applause tasted like biscuits because at the back of the room Granny Nell had managed to infiltrate in a dress with so many flowers it could feign municipal capacity. She stood beside a man holding a tray and fed the man one of her lemon thimbles every time he made a face that suggested he was about to move her along. She had put on lipstick in a color called municipal plum and it gave her the energy of a new ordinance. When Nico caught her eye she did not wave because she hated theatrical sentiment, but she lifted her chin the way you lift a beaten rug and everything in him dusted.\n\nThey gave him a key in a velvet pouch that did not fit any actual lock. It unlocked a state of mind. They gave him a schedule on thick paper with a waterline embossed as if to warn that all of this would sink if mishandled. They gave him a smile that said if you choose to step off the dais now, no one will ask why, and he stayed on the dais and shook six hands that had the softness of people who file complaints about handshakes. The interim Keeper who was leaving stood at his side like a person handing off a precious vase that had already rolled down stairs. The macaque\u2019s eyes were very bright with lack of sleep and something like relief.\n\n\u201cYou will love the plant,\u201d the macaque said under the applause, and gestured toward a glossy monster of leaves in a pot to the left of the dais. \u201cIt listens. It likes show tunes. Do not feed it sugar. Feed it gossip. It thrives on gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d Nico said, which was true on several levels, and the macaque squeezed his shoulder so hard he heard tendons compute.\n\nThey moved him, as per schedule, straight into a room that did not admit daylight and painted it on instead. The Sidekick Bureau had taken over a suite where a think tank had previously tried to make fire sit up and take notes. Lara held the door because clipboards had learned to multiply in that corridor and one must be kind to the unarmed. Inside, a gleaming screen the size of social expectations presented row upon row of faces with blue bars underneath that claimed to represent compatibility, and little locks that claimed to represent legalities, and icons shaped like muffins to warn of severe allergies to being managed. A coffee ring had indeed stained the corner where a little corner should never have been left unguarded. An assistant with eyebrows that had been trained for diplomacy touched the corner with a napkin that apologized for its lateness.\n\n\u201cWe keep it simple,\u201d the Bureau director said with the confidence of someone arguing that gravity is intuitive. \u201cYou describe your operational needs. We cross-reference with current availability, ethics flags, conflict maps, and the Unlocated. You get three interviews. You choose one, or we flip a coin in a way that looks procedural. The Important Crime-Fighting Act insists your sidekick be assigned by your office, approved by ours, and blessed by a clergy of your choice if you have one. Do you have a clergy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have an appliance that makes eggs when nervous,\u201d Nico said, and the director\u2019s pen paused mid-scratch because she did not have a field for that. \u201cOperational needs: someone who isn\u2019t impressed by uniforms. Someone who dislikes lantern parades. Someone who will eat the last biscuit without apologizing because we are not, in fact, in a story about sharing.\u201d\n\nThe faces rearranged when he said the word uniforms as if obedience had subroutines. April\u2019s face appeared briefly in a corner with a tag that said PRE\u2014COMMITTED, which he did not look at because his usefulness for longing had expired in another decade. Lara tapped at the screen without jabbing it, as if you might coax a better answer if you acted tender. Two faces floated to the top with the authority of bubbles that believed in themselves.\n\n\u201cKestrel Finch,\u201d the director said, indicating a human woman whose eyes assessed, instead of glowed. Her file had the neat scars of public service. \u201cEx-sidekick to three mid-level heroes with average mortality rates, a gift for logistics, one suspension for refusing to wear a cape during a wind advisory, one commendation for talking down a crowd when donuts ran out. Brilliant with radios. Possibly allergic to bananas. Also, Ruumal-42, a macaque trained in counter-propaganda work, nonviolent interventions, and climbing out of windows with a typewriter, but we are currently short of primate sidekicks for optics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not,\u201d Nico said, and felt the plant in the corner lean in, \u201crun with a monkey. That would become the point. If the point becomes the point, nothing else gets to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinch, then,\u201d Lara said, and smiled because the spreadsheet itself seemed to relax. \u201cShe\u2019s top shelf. The shelf is imaginary but very confident. She\u2019s between primary assignments. She likes early mornings. You\u2019ll want early mornings. You will not get early mornings, but wanting is a ritual.\u201d\n\nThey brought Kestrel in as if she were a weather change. She wore a jacket that had been altered to fit shoulders that didn\u2019t ask permission. Her hair was braided to keep it from narrating. She had a scar at her jaw that said luck had been paying attention exactly once. She took in the room with a turn of the head that made it clear a good head turn is both a map and a warning.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the plumber,\u201d she said, which was not accusation and not adoration and not the surprised contempt that often arrived baked under those words. It was a labeling, clean as writing NAILS on a jar and discovering, in fact, nails.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the person who refused a cape in high wind,\u201d he said, and Kestrel\u2019s mouth lifted a millimeter because mutual oral histories are often made of refusals. She did not put out a hand. He did not either. They regarded each other like neighboring houses that knew they were about to share a fence.\n\n\u201cThere is a clause,\u201d the director intoned, finding comfort in ritual while paper found comfort in letting itself be abused. \u201cYou two will co-sign. You will never commit to solo operations. You will attend twelve hours of interplay training, online if you prefer to loathe it in private, and you will check in with me on Thursdays to make me feel necessary. Do you consent to be paired under the Charter for Interim Duration, revocable at the point of jam.\u201d\n\n\u201cJam,\u201d Nico said, stunned by the coincidence until he realized the director had said the acronym for Joint Assignment Mandate. He signed. Kestrel signed. Their names looked like they liked standing next to each other. The plant rustled, delighted.\n\nThey went to lunch because the schedule insisted that if food was eaten in rooms with windows, calories achieved the moral high ground. Lunch was a donor affair that smelled like perfumes that had never eaten an onion. The plaza outside the World House had sprouted tiny tents that sold interpretations of sustenance. Chortle waited for them at the nearest tent with a plate of beet carpaccio arranged in the shape of \u201cYes,\u201d and an expression he might have practiced in a mirror with live audience.\n\n\u201cWorldStart,\u201d he said, as if they had all been whispering the name behind their hands. \u201cMy dear Keeper and newly minted adjunct, have you heard about our bespoke care for your bespoke burden. We design your glide path. We attach you to a brand that reassures the citizens and perturbs your enemies into khakis. We offer a package called Downstream\u2014ha-ha\u2014which focuses on your ability to keep the noisier parts of governance from splashing on shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI own two pairs of shoes,\u201d Nico said, and the truth of it did a small victory dance. \u201cYou sound like a person who would install a drain in a rectangle. It will hold for three months and then the corners will burn. No, thank you. My enemies can wear what they like.\u201d\n\nChortle laughed because good manners had saved his life once and he treated them as a second spine. He checked Kestrel with a glance and found her politely uninterested in being assessed. He waved, instead, at a rolling whiteboard where a flow chart had been written in friendly arrows. The chart suggested that by pairing with WorldStart, world leaders became photogenic waterfalls that citizens could drink from without choking. Kestrel used a beet slice as a coaster and Chortle pretended not to mind because pretending is ninety percent of diplomacy.\n\nSeven meetings commenced in the afternoon like seven amusements promised by a fair that had forgotten the rides and gotten enthusiastic about paperwork. In the first, a budget person presented numbers in beige. They had organized the world into columns that behaved. They told him how sidekicks were financed and what percentage of each cape was tax-deductible, which caused Kestrel\u2019s eyebrow to quiver in a manner that indicated a deep belief in a universe where an eyebrow might stop a clap. In the second, the Cape Compliance Office reminded him that wind maps were now considered classified because a rogue breakdancer had used them to plan a performance. He asked which part of the map told you where a cape would end up if the cape had opinions, and the Compliance officer stared at him as if he had asked about the presence of God in a spreadsheet.\n\nIn the third, a woman with hair like winter bones asked him to approve a pigeon relocation initiative. The pigeons had built private property atop municipal statues and were charging rent in the form of bread. Relocating them required a sermon about collective housing. He suggested building statues pigeons would find dull and the woman\u2019s eyes lit as if she had been waiting to be allowed to believe in boring monuments. In the fourth, an investigator briefed him on laughter distribution at investor breakfasts. Nobody ever expects laughter to be trafficked until you find invoices for guffaws and realize human joy makes a reliable commodity. \u201cWe are tracing it at the level of invoice numbering,\u201d the investigator said, trying to make spreadsheets sound like a swordfight, and Nico wondered if the real economy was always the black-market exchange of actual warmth.\n\nThe fifth meeting convened the Sidekick Code Council in a circle that strove for campfire and achieved chair store. A boy of seventeen with energy he could not disguise argued that the Code\u2019s bar on solo actions made sidekicks tools. An older woman with a voice like cared-for leather said the rule had saved her life twice, and she wanted to keep it around like a superstition that had earned its keep. Kestrel spoke only once to say that the Code should be rewritten by the least photogenic, and the council wrote that down with the fever of people noting an answer they would not ever put into practice. In the sixth, river rights knocked and he let her in. The river\u2019s human interpreter wore boots that smelled like silt and said the water wanted its own seat at the table. He asked the water how it felt about chairs. The interpreter cocked her head, listened, and said the river asked whether the chairs had backs that bent.\n\nThe seventh was a meeting with Infrastructure about Category Three designations, and he made himself behave. He contained his voice the way you can contain steam for an elegant minute before the whistle insists on happening. He described, for people who had not asked, how a sauna\u2019s drain coordinates with the arrogance of pastry trays. He showed them on paper how a Category Three could sometimes be a Category Two if you bribed gravity with a little more slope. He managed to say \u201cpeel management\u201d without laughing, which earned him a nod from a man who wore a ring with a wrench engraved on it and had the aura of someone\u2019s heroic grandfather.\n\nAn emergency introduced itself mid-afternoon with a march of interns. The blond one spoke because life had trained him to, and announced that the World House basement was gently floating. A pipe that serviced the southeast wing had made an unwise decision to become interesting. Water was pooling between archives and strategy. Meetings had a way of arrhythmia when liquid took a vote. The bouquet of brittle documents in a glass box began to sag in the room next door as the humidity climbed toward anecdote.\n\nHe and Kestrel took the stairs two at a time, leaving behind a sentence about river chairs that he would later regret abandoning mid-metaphor. The basement breathed a damp that had character. The smell of old cardboard sulked in the corners. The pipe that had capitulated was not old enough to be proud and not new enough to be stubborn. He put his hand on it the way you put your hand on a horse\u2019s neck and told it he had questions. Kestrel elbowed a storage locker that had developed opinions and dug out towels older than most charters. They worked without speaking because some partnerships begin with silence and a leak.\n\nThe rupture was at a seam a contractor had once pronounced \u201cgood enough,\u201d perhaps with a shrug that paid for a vacation. Nico tightened and tasted metal in the back of his throat. He asked Kestrel to hold one end at an angle that no three hands could find, and she did because she had a talent for becoming extra hands in a crisis. The water obeyed physics at last and stopped doing improv. Papers sighed back onto their shelves. Somewhere upstairs the donors discovered that the mini quiches had cooled.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have called a plumber,\u201d Kestrel said, panting, happy.\n\n\u201cI tried,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was busy becoming Interim Keeper.\u201d\n\nThey stood there in muck with their sleeves soaked up to ambition and he remembered, very suddenly, the jam machine on his table at home and how it had whirred for acknowledgment the day before. He told himself the thought had no bearing. He told himself a household appliance cannot influence municipal plumbing from across town, even if it loves him. The thought sat in his pocket and did not agree to go away.\n\nBy the time dawn slid off the windows the next morning, he had learned three new hallways and the names of two people who would save him if he found himself trapped beneath a collapsible table. He had also learned that hope makes the coffee taste better if you leave it alone and drink it cold. He read dossiers while eating an apple because apples haunt the pockets of men who pretend they have gotten enough sleep. The first dossier was about helmets. Not cats, though the cats with helmets had enjoyed their day. This one described a pattern of armored assaults on small, unimportant vendors who sold wire, bolts, and other objects easy to tuck into a jacket lining. The helmeted persons were tidy and unfriendly and paid in coins that no longer circulated.\n\n\u201cCopper ring,\u201d he said, aloud, because sometimes naming a thing is a passcode. The copper theft under the old tram line had quieted after his unfortunate layoff, only to become a rumor in another part of town. He traced the addresses and drew a shape. The shape did not resemble anything holy. It resembled a plan designed by people who loved geometry and not faces.\n\nKestrel put a cup of something caffeinated down by his elbow as if bribing a map. \u201cThey\u2019re meeting in the depot,\u201d she said, and tapped a spot on his estimate with a nail that had no time for polish. \u201cWe have four hours before they unspool the night\u2019s take and turn it into a rumor. We can request a squad. We can request a press shadow. We can request a permit to stand where there used to be fire extinguishers and wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can request a map no one has drawn on yet,\u201d he said, because all of his maps arrive pre-loved and it made him itchy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to be the law, even with the word Keeper taped to my suit. But we can be the person who reminds the building where its throat is.\u201d\n\nThey went without a press shadow because he liked to meet his humiliation alone. The depot crouched by the old tram line like a cat with a plan. Its tin roof had learned the drum. Pigeons considered the rafters and found them insufficiently philosophical. Graffiti bloomed along one wall in a hand he recognized as a person he had once promised to employ and then hadn\u2019t, because money behaves. They arrived with exactly one permit to do nothing, a whisper from the Bureau that the police were busy being televised somewhere corporate, and a bag of tools, because even a man with a badge uncapitalized trusts a wrench.\n\nInside the depot the air tasted of old oil and the present tense. Voices reached them in a braid. There was the hiss of wire unfurling. There was a laugh that never learned to be kind. There was also, below it, like a river under a river, the subtle syllable of a pipe too full of itself. Nico crouched and pressed his ear to a rusty panel in the wall. He could hear the depot\u2019s plumbing argue in short vowels. He could also, faintly, hear the monkey board, not of Peel & Prosper, but of a contractor\u2019s guild that had recently begun to practice governance in the shadows. Their low voices carried where schedules could not.\n\n\u201cWe pass,\u201d grunted someone whose consonants paraded in a troop. \u201cWe take this. We leave that. The Keeper is a faucet. Turn him. He\u2019ll give.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Nico said, not to the pipe, but to Kestrel, because promising to a partner counts double. He felt her nod through the floor. He felt it in his kneecap and then in his mouth, which wanted to become a whistle. He put his hand flat on the wall and pushed. The metal reluctantly consented to a gap and the gap began to talk. Through it he could see the wire stacked like sin. He could see helmets glinting in a light those helmets invented for confidence. He could also see, directly opposite, where someone had installed a false drain to carry away evidence. It ran nowhere useful. It ran to a pity pit.\n\nHe did not do lone heroics. He had promised the comma and Kestrel. They used their minutes like rope. Kestrel slid back to a vantage point that would allow a photo proving conspiracy in a court that still liked paper. Nico dialed a municipal number and got a recording telling him to leave a message after the tone. He left a message that was largely a set of measurements. He took a picture of the false drain as if it were a friend he had caught lying. When one of the helmet people turned toward the false drain and cursed it for having a moral backbone, he understood suddenly that someone ahead of him had tried to fix this, and failed, and the failure had left a shape in the room everyone was stepping around.\n\nA helmeted man with a stare you could use to open cans looked up and saw the gap in the wall and recognized, as criminals do, a mischief he had not planned. He shouted. Other helmets turned. Kestrel released from her place and returned to his side with the fastness of sound. They bolted. Running became the only punctuation. Boots slapped time. The depot yelled an echo. He counted shadows and found two extra. One belonged to an obligation. The other belonged to a rumor. He did not look back because looking back has never, in any tragedy, made someone trip less.\n\nThey made it out and into the tram bed\u2019s rib cage. Rust made lace where trains had reduced to stories. Kestrel tugged him under the carcass of a platform where the smell of cool iron offered a neutral opinion. The helmets split like traffic encountering a boulder. They flanked without grace. Nico grabbed for the whistle under his shirt as if for a sentence you didn\u2019t have time to finish and breathed into it with the full weight of someone\u2019s first breath. The sound that came was not loud. It was huge. It filled the rails. It slid along residual electricity. It went into the dirt and asked the worms to please participate. It startled the helmets because they had not planned for very old notes.\n\nThe sound also did another thing. It woke the nest of sleepers in the tunnel two bends down. The sleepers, who were people who had been told the law was a stranger and made of clocks, started awake and swore in the language of towels. They rose as a committee, all wronged, armed with broom handles and a fence. Helmets bounced off a human tide of common sense. Kestrel slid to her feet and suggested convincingly that everyone move in a direction not indicated by any arrow. He reached the van he had left under an argument with a parking sign and they dove in as the sleepers filled the depot\u2019s mouth with a new policy.\n\n\u201cNever do that without warning me,\u201d Kestrel said as he drove, and he laughed so hard he nearly hit a sign that insisted you would be judged by angels if you turned left.\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI carry emergency sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else do you carry,\u201d she asked, as none of the cigarettes in the glove compartment were actually cigarettes and none of the maps led to the ocean. She had one hand braced on the dash in a way that did not invite romance and did invite sanity. He told her about the banana pen. He told her about the token with a sandwich discount he had not yet exploited. He told her about a jar of marmalade that had once saved him from telling the truth at the wrong moment. She nodded. She patted her jacket and revealed a coil of line, two signal mirrors, a packet of raisins that had survived three administrations, and a cutting of a plant that might have ideas.\n\nThey returned to the World House, which had opinions about dirt. Lara intercepted them with a studied lack of alarm and a pair of damp cloths she must have stolen from a benevolent cafeteria. Her eyes flicked from Kestrel to Nico to the smear of tunnel on their pant legs and she decided, after a brief conference with herself, not to ask about anything yet. He loved her, in that instant, with the respect plumbers reserve for the wrench that turns without stripping.\n\n\u201cPress,\u201d she said, as if identifying weather. \u201cYou can say nothing, something, or a proposal. Nothing will be taken as guilt. Something will be taken as ignorance. A proposal will be taken as weakness unless it includes the word \u2018pilot.\u2019 We have five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a proposal,\u201d he said, wiping tunnel from his hands. \u201cSidekick Bureau pilot pairing for unglamorous crimes. Copper. Bread theft. Money laundering that uses laundry. Pair a hero with a sidekick and a plumber or other person capable of telling the truth about objects. Half pay. Double glory. Do not photograph. Results delivered on a postcard. Pilot name: Screw Coupling.\u201d\n\n\u201cScrew Coupling,\u201d Lara repeated, delighted, and wrote it down with the seriousness of ink on the Declaration of anything. \u201cI can sell that. I can sell the parts you didn\u2019t mean to be funny. The rest comes with a hat.\u201d\n\nThey walked into the press room, which was not a room but a pit with lights and smiles, and the questions distributed themselves like confetti motivated by hunger. He answered as if each camera lens were a pipe that could be persuaded if you pushed with gentleness. He said he was not a river but he had spoken to pipes and they had opinions. He said he had no desire to fight a brand war while water ran the wrong way. He introduced the pilot like a person introduces a baby at the door and then refuses to let anyone hold it. Kestrel stood half a step behind him like a sentence you complete later. When they were done and the lights let them go, he felt the exhaustion that comes when everything you said was almost true.\n\nHe made it home that night with a head that buzzed like a lamp about to go. The kitchen smelled of a recipe that had bullied joy into submission and then apologized. Granny Nell had filled the sink with soapy water that looked like a rally. She wore an apron with the legend THIS APRON HAS SEEN THINGS and a pin in the shape of a wasp that moved on its own because sometimes she made jewelry with motives. She noted the tunnel on his trousers and nodded, not at the dirt but at the part of him that had refused to become the point.\n\n\u201cHow was keeping,\u201d she asked, sifting powdered sugar over the belief that it made desserts professional.\n\n\u201cIt involves meetings,\u201d he said, and she smiled a smile that said it would. He told her about Kestrel, and Helmets, and how absurd it feels to get a discount on sandwiches because you said yes. He told her about the whistle and the sleepers and how falling apart in a controlled fashion appears to be governance. She fed him a piece of cake that had mistaken itself for a hat and made a fuss when it crumbled, not in scolding but in admiration for a good collapse.\n\nThe jam machine on the table ticked in that way that meant it wanted an audience. It had acquired a sticker in his absence that said PROPERTY OF NO ONE, which told him his grandmother had been to a thing. He touched the lever and the machine hummed like a throat preparing to speak. He lifted an eyebrow at Granny Nell and she kept sprinkling sugar until the kitchen became a weather event.\n\n\u201cAnything I should know,\u201d he asked, trying to keep casual in a room where nothing had ever successfully been casual.\n\n\u201cThere will be bees on Thursday,\u201d she said, as if announcing a guest list. \u201cI went to the World House to deliver biscuits directly to the plant, which is, may I say, extremely well. I passed a committee of men who want to redefine the word riot to mean things they don\u2019t attend, and a woman who knows exactly where the laughter invoices are printed. I kept my tongue like a secret. I ran into Mr. Chi\u2019s cousin who is collecting signatures for his electrician to be on the side of history. I told him all sides of history are history and he patted my arm as if I were adorable, and then I told him about a transformer under the 17th Street bridge that hums the names of cities we haven\u2019t built yet.\u201d\n\nHe waited, and she did not add what she needed to add. She did not tell him the thing he felt moving under her sentences like a fish under ice. She wiped the counter. She adjusted the oven dial to a number that didn\u2019t exist. She straightened a photograph of his parents without looking at it. She took a breath that held seven stories and let it out steady.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me something,\u201d he said, not in accusation but in the tone of a person checking a door before bed. She cocked her head at him and admired his face like a recipe that had come out yelling.\n\n\u201cI am not telling you many things,\u201d she said, making no apology because apologies are cakes you distribute too freely at your peril. \u201cIf you require one, I will deliver it with a ribbon. If you require two, I will write them on a pear. If you require three, I will go to the river and ask for a seat that bends. But tonight you require sleep. You will not get it. You will pretend.\u201d\n\nHe did pretend, and he slept like someone piloted by a competent clown through fields of small disasters. He woke at no hour, dressed in his two-pair shoes, and went to greet a day that had scheduled for itself both triumph and a banana peel. Kestrel waited on the stoop with a backpack folded into the impossible geometry of professionals. April waved from the curb as if to reassure herself that she could be happy for other people in a uniform. Lara texted a message that said the copper ring had scattered and the sleepers had formed a committee.\n\nThey spent the morning installing the pilot, which did not install itself so much as sit down where told and look around for reasons not to. He met a crew of electricians who had saved the city a hundred times without ever being given a hat. He signed a memorandum that read like a love letter written by someone who had been hurt and still believed in the post. He argued with a person whose job it was to make the word liability smaller. He read a note scrawled by a child and pressed at him by a mother outside the World House gates that said my dad says if you fix the drains the rats will come up and I say then we can meet them and ask them to leave. He put the note in his pocket with the token and banana pen and felt the accumulation make new weight.\n\nNear noon, a courier arrived with a box so narrow it implied secrets. The label bore the bureaucracy\u2019s calm handwriting and the slightly showy stamp of the Office. Inside lay a thin brass rod with a hook at the end, and a square folded cloth. The note explained that the rod fit into a latch above the dais in the oath room; if he chose, he could lower a shade no one had lowered in twenty years and make the room less theatrical and more accurate. The cloth, the note said, was the original oath cloth for the plant. It was to be tied around its pot when he wanted it to feel part of something. He went to the oath room during a gap that did not exist and held the rod like a key. He reached up, hooked the latch, and pulled.\n\nThe shade came down. The light gentled. The chairs looked like chairs and not like the idea of chairs. The portraits became humans and monkeys and not the reasons he would be yelled at. He tied the cloth around the plant and the plant shivered as if receiving gossip from the hands of a grandmother.\n\nNews traveled through Brasshaven as if the city itself had a bloodstream for rumor. By evening he was already being described as the Keeper who didn\u2019t clap on beat and asked chairs to be chairs. The monkeys in suits took meetings in which somebody used the word authenticity and somebody else used the word threat. A capuchin with pearls scheduled a breakfast for Necessary Rich People and determined to ask him whether he believed in Trickle-Down Bananas, and whether was the answer he wanted or wanted to be seen wanting. The river issued a sigh that raised the hair on the arms of those who listened. The sky tried on three blues before dinner.\n\nDinner arrived as a knock on his door. Granny Nell opened it without asking his permission because permission is for things that might be refused. A woman in a coat that had decided long ago it would not change stood on the threshold holding a cake that was also a hat. Her hair might have been rain once. She wore no makeup and an expression like a win. He knew her from a photograph he did not own.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said, eyes on Nico\u2019s face the way you look at an envelope you are about to open with your teeth. \u201cI am here because your grandmother told me to stop imagining the word later. I am also here to tell you that keeping is a job I invented with other names and I do not want to be thanked. I brought a cake that must be worn before it is eaten, and news that has no shape yet, and a letter addressed to you by someone who believes in drains.\u201d\n\nGranny Nell stood behind her with those ten eras again in her smile and raised an eyebrow that had, once, convinced policemen to apologize to their own hats. She held the jam machine\u2019s cord in her hand like a leash on an animal that was going to behave in the way animals do when they love you and you have betrayed them by leaving for the day. Nico felt the floor tilt and then steady, and then he felt his fingers close around the whistle under his shirt as if his heart had rehearsed.\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d he said, and the words did what doors always hope words will do. They let a story in and made it sit down, and poured it tea, and told it that it was welcome to make a mess if the mess was honest.Chapter 5\n\nMorning arrived with the bureaucratic punctuality of a stamp, as if someone somewhere had filed the dawn under Deliverables and cc\u2019d the windows. The cake that had also been a hat leaned on the counter wearing the marks of removed candles like chalk from a solved proof. The letter sat under his tea mug as if that could keep it from proposing anything. His grandmother was already up, having negotiated with the kettle and whatever birds thought they ran the block, and the apartment had that poised-to-tell-a-joke stillness that meant either something had been decided or something had been admitted.\n\nHe had not slept for very long, but what he\u2019d managed had been the exact weight of a coin. In the dream that came and went, he was a boy again on the bathroom floor, watching water find the drain without anybody telling it \u201cnow,\u201d and his mother had been there in the doorway asking him if it bothered him that gravity was so sure of itself. He had thought he\u2019d invented her voice to have a place to put the letter, but the coat still hung on the chair and a bobby pin glittered on the table\u2019s edge like proof of intent. When he picked up the letter, the paper felt older than the ink and the ink felt like it had traveled far with a mouth full of news.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t open your mail because that is a moral boundary I refuse to cross,\u201d his grandmother said, which was true if you extended the definition of \u201cmoral\u201d to include \u201cannoying.\u201d \u201cI did, however, smell it to judge character. It smells like a garage that got religion.\u201d\n\nHe slid his thumb under the flap and loosened the adhesive with a care that felt ceremonial because everything that morning wanted to be a ceremony. The handwriting inside had the confident slant of a person whose sentences expected to be used. There were no greetings as such, and he found that refreshing. Whoever wrote it believed salutations belonged to parades and invitations to court dates. The first line took a deep breath on his behalf and got on with it.\n\nMr. Fawcett,\n\nIf you are reading this, the excuse of later has finally failed to do its job. Good. My name will not help you for the same reason names written on the bottoms of boats do not make them float, but write it down anyway so it will irritate the right file someday: Brindle Clarke, City Drainwright Emeritus, dissolved under unceremonious circumstances after pointing out to people who clip policy pins to their lapels that they had moved a comma in public and a bracket in private. A long time ago, before the Important Crime-Fighting Act became the leash it now pretends not to be, the city built a machine under the city that does not belong to any one administration. It was designed to carry directives the way pipes carry water. It has gates. It has vents. It has a simple instruction that is not anymore.\n\nHe breathed once and let the words flow because they had momentum. Brindle wrote with the frustration of a man who had learned the uses of a wrench late and the dangers of polite language early. The Act\u2019s clause about sidekicks and leaders had always had a comma that made sense to anyone who had ever had to carry a couch up a stairwell: a pause, a sharing, a breath in which two people agreed not to break each other. Last winter, when the punctuation was changed to move the weight, a corresponding change happened in the infrastructure below the World House. A bracket that had held two valves in equal tension shifted; one now bore more load than it should. As above, etcetera. The city, at its most literal, had changed who held verbs.\n\nBrindle did not claim magic outright because he did not have to. He described a conduit under the ceremonial chamber where oaths echoed, a rib of bronze that transmitted more than sound. He described a gear house nicknamed The Throat, where requests and their small cousins went to be sorted from screams. He marked three locations on a crude map hand-drawn on the back of a page he had stolen from a consultant\u2019s slide deck and blessed by spilling coffee on. Under Vulcan Depot. Behind the west abutment of the Seventeenth Street bridge. Beneath the plant in the World House itself. He wrote that moving the bracket back would not fix every sentence in the city, but it would put back the pause that made partnerships a partnership and not a costume. He wrote that he believed in drains because drains had never lied to him, and by the way, if Nico was looking for a word to trust, he could do worse than \u201cunder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re frowning like a person who just realized a comma has teeth,\u201d Nell observed, sliding a plate of eggs across the table, and he loved her for making breakfast sit next to crisis as if they were cousins at a wedding. \u201cDoes it tell you where to go implement a minor correction in the central nervous system while wearing those shoes they gave you, or does it instruct you to calmly quit and raise goats on a hillside with no civic architecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cOption one with a flattering angle,\u201d he said, reading the paragraph twice because promises hide in corners. \u201cIt\u2019s a map and a grievance. It\u2019s also a warning about bees.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh good,\u201d she said, pleased in a way that made his scalp tighten because his grandmother was only pleased about trouble when she thought the trouble might be worth its outfit. \u201cI was afraid I would have to organize the bees without supervision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she tell you after I went to brush my teeth,\u201d he asked, using the pronoun his mouth had chosen in the night and trusting his grandmother not to make a joke of it. \u201cBefore she left with the cake tin and the habit of not saying her name until someone earned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me she had done a cowardly, brave thing and was not yet sure in which order,\u201d Nell said, not hurrying the sentences because she trusted them to arrive. \u201cShe told me she had been following a noise all her life that sounded like a city being told to go to bed when the city was not yet sleepy. She apologized for the weather twenty years ago, which I decline to forgive because if I start I will not stop. She told me she used to be very good at stealing groceries and giving them back later as casseroles. She left you that letter because you like instructions. She asked me not to tidy up behind you too much because you will need to trip once this week to learn. I told her I reserve the right to catch cookware before it shatters.\u201d\n\nHe had known for most of his adult life that there were stories in his house that did not swing open just because he knocked. It was not, until this week, unkind. It was precaution. People keep the lids on boiling things for a reason. He folded the letter and placed it in his pocket with the token and the pen and the note from the child for whom rats were a conversation. He wiped his plate with bread because the eggs had been essentially a thesis. He glanced at the jam machine and the jam machine ticked in a key that made him suspect it understood the phrase \u201cThe Throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to go to the Sidekick Code Council and then pretend not to want to break a piece of furniture with my forehead at a budget review,\u201d he said, standing into his shoes because the shoes did not sit still when you looked at them. \u201cAfter that I have one free hour during which either we save the geography of a bracket or we eat soup in a closet and speak without any nouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring me back a noun,\u201d she said, tying her hair into a bun so ferocious it could have fought it out with the municipal plum lipstick. \u201cThe good ones have been rehearsed for other shows and keep missing their cues. Also, on your way home, stop by Mr. Chi\u2019s and ask for the tea he sells to people who have to stand up in front of committees and ask for mercy without blushing. He will tell you there is no such tea. Ask again. He will give you dried leaves he claims are a small mistake.\u201d\n\nThe World House had dreamed in fluorescent while he slept, and the day\u2019s agenda had already acquired two new items just to test how far he could bend without learning what snapped felt like. Kestrel walked in step with him along the corridor where portraits looked resigned, a stack of folders tilted against her hip the way you lean a shield when you\u2019re trying not to look like you\u2019re carrying one. She took the letter when he offered it because trust was a decision they were going to have to make weekly, then daily, then twice before lunch.\n\n\u201cBrindle Clarke,\u201d she said, somewhere between impressed and irritated. \u201cHe shows up at the ends of memos like a ghost who refuses to act like a metaphor. I\u2019ve never seen anyone fire a person for punctuation with such confidence. The Throat is a rumor with good posture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could start by seeing the rumor,\u201d he said, keeping his voice level because the moment you sounded like someone who believed in backstage machines people decided they had to choose between you and shoes. \u201cBut first we have to let the Council shout about commas in a socially acceptable circle.\u201d\n\nThe Council had upgraded to folding chairs with dignity and a snack table that had learned humility after last week\u2019s donut mutiny. The young ones arrived first with energy and suggestions packaged as petitions. The veterans came in pairs, already arguing on the decibel of two friends who used to be enemies and now practiced the art of never quite healing as a way to keep each other alive. The rulebook sat in the center like a priest you\u2019re fond of but refuse to obey.\n\nHe laid out a case for rewriting the clause not because changing the words would change the world, but because changing the words might change the world\u2019s excuse. He did not say the word spell because the room would have spat him out the window like a seed. He said the word habit and let the Council taste their own exhaustion. Kestrel spoke in the measured way of a person who does not rise unless there is rope to climb. She described the difference between responsibility and ownership like a poem written by a locksmith. A boy in a cap with opinions etched into it asked a question about what happens if the Keeper turns out to be a person you wouldn\u2019t let feed your cat, and the old woman with the leather voice said, sweet as syrup, that\u2019s why we have commas.\n\nThey were three arguments in when the bees arrived as promised and not scheduled. They did not swarm so much as convene. A hum arranged itself in the air like an agenda. Men who used the word optics for lunch flinched because optics have never forgiven bees for not attending their launch parties. The bees moved around the room with clean determination, avoiding faces, landing on the rulebook, landing on the edges of the chairs, landing on the loop of Kestrel\u2019s braid like punctuation considering employment. Granny Nell had, at some point that morning, exchanged pleasantries with a beekeeper in a jacket the color of a green market and invited the bees to consider governance. Bees consider quickly. They crowded the comma in the clause like jurors.\n\n\u201cThis is fine,\u201d Lara murmured from the doorway, her clipboard staying notably still because she had learned the life-saving art of not fanning a situation into melodrama. \u201cThey\u2019re calm. We\u2019re calm. No sudden gestures. We will all pretend this is how policy is made because, in fact, it usually is.\u201d\n\nA woman from the Keeper\u2019s legal office made it into the room wearing a smile upholstered in guidelines and announced that while she respected all pollinators, bees were not a recognized stakeholder in the Code\u2019s language. Nico said bees have always recognized language, and the woman wrote something down that would later be authoritatively misused. The bees eventually left on some signal invisible to everyone except a pale boy in the corner who had been timing the humming with his fingers, and the room let out a breath it did not know it was holding like a held note that finally made peace with the end of a song.\n\nHe took his hour where it didn\u2019t fit, and Kestrel took it with him. The map folded itself into his pocket as if numbers had turned into origami cranes while he wasn\u2019t looking. The door to the Under-levels opened when Lara produced a key that technically did not work for that lock, and he thought again, with gratitude, about the dignity of people who know how much help to be. The air changed three steps down, reacted less to perfume and more to the sincerity of mildew. Pipes ran along the walls with the patient arrogance of old bones. Somewhere a pump sighed and forgot to be discreet, and a clamp, tightened seventy-four years ago by someone who whistled dirty verses, held on.\n\nThe Throat did not announce itself with trumpets because trumpets are wasted underground. It announced itself by becoming the only conversation the room wanted to have. It was not a single thing; it was an arrangement. Where two broad ducts met and narrowed there was a nexus built with the hubris of people who had never tried to move a piano through a narrow door. Valves clicked. Gates leaned. A framework of bronze in the shape of a throat sat so neatly into the brick you might think the brick had made space of its own accord. Kestrel stopped to stare at the bracket because even a person who had promised herself to scoff at allegory had to nod when faced with engineering that had a personality.\n\nThe bracket had been shifted. He saw it with the same part of him that read fittings by touch. A gouge on the bronze where a tool had slipped and been caught. A scar on the wall where someone\u2019s boot had braced. A smear of a grease that had already decided to turn to dust and failed because it loved too much. The weight sat on the wrong side. The words in his head rearranged themselves from swear to solve and back again, a good rhythm for difficult tasks. If he wanted to move it, he would need leverage; if he wanted to live, he would need permission; if he wanted to keep either, he would need a story.\n\n\u201cDo not,\u201d Kestrel said, and the \u201cdo\u201d contained an instruction sheet and a recipe for regret. \u201cWe will not pull anything in a room where, if we cough, the city sneezes. We will take a picture, we will take a measurement, we will take our desire to a meeting and refuse to apologize for its volume.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are correct,\u201d he said, while his fingers traced the old position in the air, which made the plant in the oath room rustle in a way he could feel in the back of his neck. \u201cBut if you were to, purely hypothetically, hold that end up three degrees while I push, the leverage we could achieve would\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014get you elected to the emergency ward,\u201d she said, and he loved her because it felt like being forgiven before he sinned. They left The Throat with an intimacy reserved for places that would swallow you if you told the wrong joke. They carried with them the knowledge that somebody had moved a pause with a spanner and gotten paid with a better seat.\n\nChortle was waiting for them on the steps when they reemerged into day the color of a freshly unrolled graph. He wore a tie with tiny suns that somebody had told him meant optimism and not glare. A camera nearby heard his voice lengthen its vowels and decided it was nourishment. He congratulated Nico on his pilot as if it had been mutually agreed upon at a neutral resort. He mentioned that WorldStart had launched a companion initiative called PairFlow that matched donors with noble causes and required only that the noble causes never speak rudely about fruit. He said the word synergy in a tone that suggested French origin and all the vowels fell on the pavement like coins.\n\n\u201cI just saw a bracket that used to be a promise,\u201d Nico said, because lying to Chortle would have been a degree of disrespect the chimp had done nothing good enough to earn. \u201cI will move it back when I have a crowd large enough to make metaphor into a video. You are welcome to bring your suns and your cameras. We\u2019ll need light for the bolts.\u201d\n\nChortle blinked because clarity makes most salesmen itch. He asked whether anything that would affect markets would occur in the next twenty-four hours so he could not be blamed in the right circles, and Kestrel said markets have had centuries to learn to swim. He held for a second as if considering the power of his own options, and then exercised the most useful one: he stepped back three feet and allowed events to happen without him. It is the sort of generosity no one can teach. It\u2019s the kind he could take credit for later.\n\nGranny Nell instructed the bees to be available for a half hour in the afternoon and then sent him a note through Lara that said, in a handwriting you could ride a bicycle on, If you do pull the thing, warn the tea. The plant in the oath room had been tied with the cloth; gossip wafted from it like a sermon you\u2019d go to for the snacks. He went there to ask its consent, because there are only so many mistakes you can make before you run out of friends, and the plant obligingly leaned toward him as if smelling the part of his breath that did not lie.\n\n\u201cI have lived under six Keepers and two false gods,\u201d its caretaker said, confirming that people who love plants have the best job of all in rooms that tend toward performance. \u201cIt likes you because you lower shades and speak as if wood has done you a favor. If you must move the hardware below, give it a song to concentrate on. Plants do better when no one expects them to be clever about policy.\u201d\n\nHe chose a time that did not exist in the schedule, and Lara created a paper butterfly that landed on an assistant\u2019s desk and made them cry in a way that translated to permission. April met them on the stairs with a handful of muffins that had been legally de-weaponized; she said the press had sniffed out the story and wanted adjectives. He said the adjective was \u201cunder,\u201d and she said that was a preposition with mood disorders, and that would have to do.\n\nThey did not go alone. The electric workers from the morning\u2019s pilot came with tool belts and the expression of people who were done applauding incompetence in anyone with a title. A woman from the river\u2019s office came because water liked to see how metaphors enacted themselves. The boy with the timing fingers shuffled down with a face so bright he could have guided ships, accompanied by his mother, who had brought a bag of almonds in case governance fell low on blood sugar. A reporter came and, having learned something during the bees, left the long lens upstairs and brought a notebook that could sit quietly. Chortle surprised him by sending a junior\u2014an earnest macaque in a shirt that didn\u2019t fit\u2014who sat on the bottom step and wrote on the back of his hand a single word: pause.\n\nHe did what Kestrel told him and what Brindle suggested and what his grandmother would have done if a stove had started an argument, which is to say he hung his impatience in the doorway and spoke to the bronze in his palm as if it were a dog with dignity. They chocked what needed chocking. They wedged what asked to be wedged. Kestrel placed her shoulder where his fingers would have defaulted, and three electricians used their language to sweeten the bolts. He took the spanner in both hands and counted to the right number in his head so the muscle in his forearm that had learned to listen wouldn\u2019t get offended. When he pushed, the city made a noise like a person taking off a tight shoe.\n\nThe bracket moved. He felt it settle. He felt a line unbend that he had not known was in his spine. Upstairs, under the plant, in the oath room where light pretended to be civilized, the cloth around the pot loosened and tightened once, like a heartbeat that had been holding itself very still for company. In the Sidekick Bureau, a return key on the big screen resisted a memo for a second and then allowed itself to be pressed by an assistant who had been pressing keys for a living long enough to know when the keyboard wanted something different. In a corner of Brasshaven where five small girls practiced tightrope on a painted line, all five stepped in unison without instruction and laughed with the shock of pulling it off. In the depot across town, a helmeted man stopped halfway through a generosity-free sentence and discovered he was too tired to finish it. Pulling that bracket was not a revolution; it was a tilt. Sometimes tilt is as much as you get. Sometimes tilt is the beginning of not falling.\n\nThey stood back and waited to see if anything would leak. It did not, unless you count relief. Kestrel looked at him with a face that contained both safety and something that might be friendship if it was allowed to grow without adjectives. The boy with the timing fingers nodded, satisfied without explaining who he\u2019d been counting for, and the river\u2019s emissary said the water would be sending a note in due course, accompanied by a list of chairs it had approved for trial sitting. The electric workers clapped without irony and without that careful distance people acquire when applause becomes a job, and it did a thing to him he didn\u2019t know how to hold yet.\n\nThe monkey in the shirt that didn\u2019t fit approached with a caution that might have been trained and might have been born. He cleared his throat and glanced at his hand where the word pause had become a gray smudge, and he said that his boss would want him to ask if this action had been cleared with any of the committees whose job it was to engineer approvals for things the city had already done. Nico told him no, and the monkey smiled as if the word fit his teeth and took his pen out to write it down again.\n\nThe press tried to make it about bravery. April kindly tripped and spilled muffins in front of three cameras in a pattern that nudged their angles toward reassuring blur. Lara compiled a bullet list that didn\u2019t look like a bullet list and called it a brief, and Chortle released a statement that used the phrase technically within the scope of my optimism with such skill you could hear interns being promoted somewhere across town. Granny Nell sent a text that said that was not the sound of a city sneezing, darling, that was the sound of a city refusing to be polite about its allergies.\n\nThere were consequences because even good tilt requires payment. The orangutan with the red scarf convened a breakfast wherein spoons clinked against bowls in a way that felt like voting, and he asked in a voice gentle as knives whether the Keeper had considered how many investors would be offended by a city that practiced self-respect under its own floors. The Moderator sent a polite memorandum reminding Nico that some levers existed not to be pulled but to inspire letters. The Sidekick Code Council received three strongly worded emails containing the word exigency and sturdily ignored two of them. The capuchin in pearls had the grace to send a bouquet of lilies that smelled like retirement and a note that said I admire a man who lowers a shade.\n\nThat night, when the meetings had stopped but hadn\u2019t, the apartment received him like an object familiar with returns. The jam machine had taken it upon itself to manufacture a thin disc of ruby that tasted like cherries and insomnia. His grandmother sat cross-legged on a kitchen chair reading a booklet from the Office of Linguistic Standards, which she was defacing with a series of cats as if to give it something to do besides scold. She set the booklet aside when he came in and listened with her whole face, which is a skill she had offered everyone she loved and denied everyone who had tried to take it for free.\n\nHe told her about the bracket, and the bees, and the small change in the city\u2019s inhale. He told her about the letter and how the Throat felt like touching the underside of a promise. He told her about the monkey writing the word no on his hand and Kestrel\u2019s distinct relief at not being asked to carry something absolutely ridiculous on the first week. Then he told her about the woman who had been framed by his doorway and had brought a cake that was a hat and a sentence she owed herself, because sometimes you have to report aloud that a thing happened or the thing remains a rumor with your face.\n\n\u201cShe brought a second letter,\u201d Nell said, and once again the room\u2019s stillness became a musician\u2019s pause instead of a doctor\u2019s pause. \u201cYou did not see it because I am greedy with drama. It is not for you. It is to be delivered to a machine under a bridge that hums the names of cities we have not built yet. I intend to walk there in a dress with the right hemline for history and make the delivery in such a way that pigeons will believe they have witnessed ceremony. If you want to come, you may. If you do not, I will lie to you later in a way that teaches you nothing.\u201d\n\nHe believed her, which is better than believing in lots of things less durable. He believed her when she implied that the city\u2019s enchantments had synergies with its appliances, and that his mother would know where to send a letter because she had lived with the sound of movement for two decades without asking permission to set it to music. He believed her when she said Wasp Day was going to be important in a mood he had not yet guessed. He went with her because the tradition of keeping is often just walking behind a person who knows the way and not correcting their sense of direction.\n\nThe Seventeenth Street bridge was not on speaking terms with the river that night and that was fine because the river did not love conversation in public. The transformer under it hummed like a brain agreeing to sing. The hum was uncannily close to a catalogue. It seemed to be listing not just cities but rooms, the way a librarian recites shelves to locate a missing book. Granny Nell held the letter between thumb and forefinger as if balancing a biscuit and bent down like the world had put its footstool in the right place. She tucked the letter into a seam of the transformer\u2019s housing with the authority of someone mailing a dangerous invitation.\n\n\u201cDo you think she really invented keeping, in the way one person invents a game by playing it so earnestly everyone else is embarrassed,\u201d he asked, and allowed his surprise at how gentle his voice could sound when the river was paying attention.\n\n\u201cI think she did it and then refused to patent it,\u201d Nell said, straightening and wincing like a woman who had carried more than her share and never sent the bill. \u201cShe would have been an excellent patent. The kind that ends up on aprons.\u201d\n\nThey stood there a while in a quiet that felt like work being done elsewhere. The transformer hummed out a city that had not happened yet and he heard its name as both insult and promise: Underkeep. He felt along his throat for the whistle, reassured once more by the cool pressure of an emergency. The hum shifted up a key the way a bird changes direction when invisible wind takes a vote and then dropped back as if agreeing to watch tomorrow closely.\n\nIn the morning, he woke to messages that tried to decide whether he was good or simply inconvenient. Kestrel sent him a list entitled Things To Avoid While Half The City Has Opinions, which included open microphones, ladders, and speeches where the word hero was a noun. Lara texted him a photograph of the plant wearing the cloth like an old soldier pleased by a new scarf, and underneath she wrote, Good tilt, would tilt again, and then, more seriously, There is a leak in the laughter invoices. Someone with access has been diverting mirth into weather systems. Side effects include fog that knows its own joke and morning shows with slightly less venom. We have a meeting. Bring reasonable metaphors.\n\nThe Sidekick Bureau had expanded its spreadsheet to include a column for pilots that did not photograph well. Screw Coupling had attracted a volunteer list of people who weren\u2019t famous but were used to being necessary, and he had a moment in the hallway where all he could do was stand against a wall and let the shock of being joined wash over him like cold water after a hard day. The monkey board at Peel & Prosper scheduled a breakfast with the title \u201cClarifying Partnerships,\u201d and a memoran on his desk suggested mildly that his office should avoid creating the impression there existed mechanical linkages below city infrastructure that responded to policy punctuation. Old men who had trained their hair to lie wrote in elegant blue jotting that he was irresponsible, and kids chalked his name beside a picture of a pipe with confetti coming out of it and expected nothing except that he would not step on the drawing.\n\nHe walked into the meeting about laughter expecting to hear a story about cartelized merriment and heard, instead, the outline of a larger design. Chortle\u2019s name was on the third page next to a column that said distribution logistics, but his signature was nowhere near the paragraph that assigned rights. The name there made the Moderator blanch when he read it and caused the capuchin in pearls to make the tiny sound people make when a shoe anticipates a foot. It was an old name, small in the mouth, the kind you pull out of drawers when you are packing to move and find yourself sitting on the floor considering going back to bed: Quorum.\n\nQuorum, as Lara patiently pointed out, was not one person. It was the entity that convened when enough important chairs sat down in one place and decided that their legs, taken collectively, made a table. It had only ever signed two things\u2014once a permission for a masquerade to burn itself safely and once the white paper that became the Important Crime-Fighting Act\u2014and each time, something physical had changed under the World House. He learned this with the sullen fascination of a person who has always suspected the city had two sets of stairs and now had the map and a flashlight. He learned, while April exhaled in the corner as if someone had just loosened the back of her dress, that Quorum had commissioned a second machine eleven years ago not to carry directives but to filter them. The filter sat in the laughter invoices, in the dye of city flags, in the sugar dispensers at public events, in the gloss on press badges when lights hit right. It made joy behave. It made outrage tasteful. It kept certain verbs from gathering too many friends.\n\nHe wanted to find a pen and do violence to capital letters. He wanted to eat something that would make him strong enough to throw a crocodile at a meeting. He wanted only to go home and list everything that had gone right that week on the back of a receipt and read it until his eyes watered for an uncomplicated reason. Instead, he threw the text of Screw Coupling up on a screen and asked the room if anyone was thirsty for jobs that looked small enough to forgive. He did not say the word sabotage because Chortle had sat down and crossed his legs like a person who had chosen to be in the bystanders\u2019 photograph. He did not say the word mother because if he did he would be asked to explain a hat cake and he did not think anyone would behave around such a confection.\n\nHe stepped outside with Kestrel during a lull that no one had authorized and looked down into the square where a girl in roller skates deployed a line of plastic cups like a parade of tiny marching opinions. The sky had chosen honesty and was practicing it by refusing to settle. He could feel the city\u2019s drains working the way you can feel your own blood flow when you remember to sit still, and for a second he considered how much of keeping is not action but keeping the right silences from being turned into walls.\n\n\u201cFirst week,\u201d Kestrel said, in the tone of someone finishing a fable so the children would have something to tuck under their pillows. \u201cDo you feel proud. Do you feel tired. Do you feel like calling in a favor that no one has actually promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and smiled because it was an answer and an indictment and a promise to meet the morning somewhere that was not polite. \u201cAlso I feel like my calf muscles have become information. Also I feel like I have been handed a verb and asked to carry it safely to the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen put it in your pocket,\u201d she said, not looking at him, because partnered kindness should never look you in the eye unless you ask. \u201cAnd for the love of early mornings, when the bees arrive again, make sure the tea has been warned.\u201d\n\nThey warned the tea by drinking some and pretending it was brave. They warned the river by asking what it preferred to be called during formal sessions. They warned the plant by singing an old show tune in an off-key sotto voce and the plant rewarded them by dropping a leaf onto Lara\u2019s hair which somehow improved her arguments for the rest of the day. They warned no one who would sell the warning for a stipend. They went back down when the transformer hummed a new city, and when the letter under the bridge wriggled against the metal like something trying to hatch, they waited with their hands in their pockets and their shoulders square and their mouths closed, because sometimes the best kind of keeping is what you do when you suspect the room is about to know more than you do and you decide not to interrupt.Chapter 8\n\nThe morning came up laughing and refused to apologize. Fog had rolled in from the river and taken a course in manners; it gathered itself at corners and bowed before crossing streets. It giggled whenever it found a traffic light trying to maintain composure. People stepped into its softness and came away with chuckles in their hair. A woman on a bicycle stalled at an intersection because the fog whispered a joke about socks to her calves, and three suited macaques were overheard demanding to know who had authorized the humidity to distribute punch lines. Brasshaven had always been a city that exhaled stories, but this was different. This was weather that had been taught to flirt.\n\nAt the World House the fog flowed through the columns and sat politely on the marble like an audience waiting for the first violin to admit how much it wanted to be a drum. Lara\u2019s text arrived before he\u2019d opened the blinds. Laughter filter has breached containment, she wrote, precise as always. Morning shows softer. Commuters more forgiving than traffic warrants. The river is pleased and alarmed. Quorum has sent an invitation. It looks like a summons dressed as a brunch.\n\nHe dressed in the shoes that felt like they had been given a briefing. The whistle settled under his shirt like a fact. He made tea that had been sold to him as a small mistake and found, in his grandmother\u2019s kitchen, a note propped against a jar of marmalade that read, in a handwriting that had once been forced to swear in court, Don\u2019t let them eat the fog. It looked like the sort of joke you frame for later. It tasted like warning. Nell herself stood on a chair adjusting a string of paper lanterns that had never yet been invited to be formal. She wore a jacket the color of old news, which on her became prophecy.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to contain it as branding,\u201d she said as if telling him about the weather and not war. \u201cThere\u2019s a tent downtown with fog in it and a line of people paying to be lifted a quarter inch by their own faces. Tell them no. Tell them the fog has better things to do than seminar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve sent a summons,\u201d he said, fastening the badge as if there were a way to make it go on straight when the world had not yet settled. \u201cQuorum wants to talk. Or perform talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWear their chairs like hats,\u201d she replied, stepping down and catching his chin with fingers that could still take a splinter out blind. \u201cWhen they ask you how you plan to make people behave, ask them how they plan to make people want to. The two are cousins who only speak at funerals.\u201d\n\nQuorum\u2019s chamber was not a chamber, because rooms do not, strictly speaking, convene. It was the posture a building assumes when enough powerful chairs decide to sit at once. The air had been pressed into fairness. The walls had found a tone that discouraged confessions and applauded efficient lies. A ring of tables circled a ring of microphones, each one rehearsed to make any voice sound like it had remembered, all on its own, to be reasonable. The faces around the table were the sort of faces that never started rumors because they were the rumors. The Moderator sat as if the chair had finally, after long lobbying, agreed to take his weight without comment. The capuchin in pearls had brought her sadness and polished it. Chortle perched three seats back from center, practicing that studied attentiveness which allows a person to claim later that they were present at the birth of something important and had never once thought of diapers.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned,\u201d said the voice that belonged to Quorum without being any specific mouth. It arose from the ring the way steam rises from a pot you didn\u2019t intend to boil. \u201cThe laughter invoice system is experiencing leakage. Events in the atmosphere suggest the filter is offline or operating in a manner inconsistent with the public good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public likes to laugh,\u201d Nico said, and watched a vein on the Moderator\u2019s temple suggest that while laughter was all very well, liking it was the kind of thing you said on buses and not at tables. \u201cAlso, if you intend to weaponize fog, do it with permission from the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have interfered with an aspect of the city\u2019s mechanical dignity,\u201d Quorum said, and the words sat in the room like chairs being moved when somebody you loved was asleep. \u201cBrackets are not for amateurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI moved a pause,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d put it on the wrong side. Partners were being turned into advertisements. The city was translating nouns into credit ratings. I put back a breath you took away with a wrench because you were impatient with air.\u201d\n\nThey would have yelled, in a circle that believed itself above the need to raise voices, but the fog slipped under the door and asked everyone to be ridiculous for twelve seconds and a half. Twelve seconds of soft chaos. Pearls took a nap in a cup of coffee. A macaque undid his tie in a gesture that made three capuchins remember their first summer of adulthood and forget their scorn. Chortle\u2019s pupils expanded as if someone had told him he could say whatever he actually thought once and the sky would not crash. The moment ended as moments do when they become too visible. The fog moved on. Quorum found its tone again and handed out consequences that had the weight of nicely folded towels.\n\n\u201cCease all unsanctioned interventions below,\u201d came the verdict, wrapped in the unhelpful virtue of committee. \u201cReport to the Laughter Clearinghouse and accept the oversight of the Filter Authority. Submit pilot programs for rebranding to ensure message discipline. You will refrain from summoning bees without apian consultation. You will be invited to a gala.\u201d\n\nNico inhaled and let go of the vision of hurling a succulent at the nearest carved arch. \u201cI will not submit to a structure designed to make joy behave,\u201d he said, steady, a single syllable longer than a hiss, a single syllable shorter than a speech. \u201cI\u2019ll visit the Clearinghouse and ask it if it agrees to being your faucet. If it does, we\u2019ll negotiate. If it doesn\u2019t, we won\u2019t. I will not supervise fog for your donors. You can sell T-shirts that say Keep Calm to anyone who wants to wear them. I\u2019m here to look at the pipes.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Kestrel joined him in a hallway only slightly less choreographed than the chamber, a hallway in which a painting of a bridge had been hung so that it would always look like it had been installed a hair off-plumb, a perpetual goad to those who believed in levels. She had acquired a smudge of fog on her shoulder that looked like it liked her. She handed him a folder that smelled faintly of hot paper, neatly corralled by Lara, with an address scrawled across the top in a hand too practical to be called elegant: The Clearinghouse for Civic Levity, established in the bones of the Gold Finch Theater, three blocks off Riverline, beneath a marquee that never got around to saying goodbye.\n\n\u201cApril stole this for us while Chortle waxed bespoke about PairFlow on the radio,\u201d Kestrel said, with a satisfaction that only partly derived from a successful theft. \u201cThe Clearinghouse is a machine made of clerks, invoices, and a well-meaning ghost. If you ask it politely, it turns joy into tokens you can redeem at palatable moments. If you ask it rudely, it corrects your grammar. We should go ask it a bad question and see if it tells the truth anyway.\u201d\n\nThe Gold Finch Theater was a building composed of second chances. Its gilt had refused to tarnish just because life had gotten damp. Its velvet had become threadbare and proud. Children had kissed in its balcony and grown cynical in its dress circle and come back when they needed to remember what surprise looked like. Now its front doors hung open under the dying flowers of the marquee and a board inside presented a menu that read, in a beautiful hand: Current Program: Redirection of Spontaneity for the Good of Civic Health. The price list below suggested rates for applause by the minute, laughter by the fraction, and delight by the kilo, which would have been satire if not for the clerk with the tidy bun who raised her eyes and asked if they had an appointment.\n\n\u201cWe have a leak,\u201d Nico said, because people who stand behind desks like to begin at the part of the story they can assign a number. \u201cThe fog is telling jokes on corners without codes. I\u2019ve been told by chairs to ensure that the Clearinghouse manages that \u2018consistency\u2019 with something called oversight. I want to see the machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in it,\u201d the clerk said, the small smile of a person satisfied to be metaphysical without trying too hard. \u201cBut yes. Downstairs. Sign this consent that says you will not accuse the Clearinghouse of crimes against spontaneity. It is delicate. It will pretend not to hear you for the first two complaints to give you a chance to rephrase.\u201d\n\nDownstairs was a transformational skeleton. A stage ran along one end where a blackboard labeled Invoices Pending held back a tide of paper. A series of ducts hummed along the ceiling as if the air had opinions. The machine itself was less a machine than a choreography: a central pump that bore a resemblance to an oversized typewriter; columns that concealed within them scrolling mirrors; a set of wires strung like lines of music between wheels; and, impossibly, a faintly amused temperature. Kestrel touched a copper fin and withdrew her hand, not burned, but having been informed that this was not the fin to touch first.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in making joy behave,\u201d Nico said to the room, the pipes, the clerk, the typewriter, the ducts, the ghost he could almost but not quite see reclining on the fainting couch the theater had left backstage when the past had moved out. \u201cBut I am interested in reminding it where its pockets are.\u201d\n\nThe typewriter rattled and refused to answer on the first complaint. He tried again, and again, because rules like that are baked into devices by people who imagine themselves saving you from yourself. On the third complaint as per the manual, the pump burped out a little ticket. It read: We are set to divert seventy percent of uncontrolled laughter into scheduled celebrations with the approval of Quorum. We are also set to redirect thirty percent of uncontrolled laughter into fog, as per emergency protocols last invoked during the Year of the Unpersuasive Parade. Your settings are dated. Your defaults are tired. Please advise.\n\n\u201cWho set the fog,\u201d Kestrel asked the clerk, watching the machine with the same eye she reserved for rooftops. \u201cDates. Names. We don\u2019t need a cautionary tale. We need someone\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\nThe clerk flipped a page with the satisfaction of producing homework that had been done. \u201cEleven years ago,\u201d she said, \u201cduring the Act. The filter was, I am told, one of the protections. It was supposed to keep crowds from becoming mobs and mobs from becoming armies and armies from becoming embarrassing. The instructions came from Quorum. The machine is not a person and does not take bribes, but it loves authorization like opera. If you write a better song, it will perform it.\u201d\n\nNico thought about the bracket. He thought about bees learning the taste of clauses. He thought about The Throat and about the transformer under the Seventeenth Street bridge and about the letter that hummed now in its seam like a tooth about to declare itself. He thought, in a way he had not permitted himself since he was eighteen and wrote sloppily righteous memos to people who stayed up late outmaneuvering grammar, about rules being true for long enough to become habits. He looked at Kestrel because she had the specific kind of sense you develop by holding other people\u2019s rope.\n\n\u201cIf we were to,\u201d he said, slow enough the machine could be an interpreter and not an enemy, \u201cwrite a new default with no budget line for joy capture and a big fat budget line for joy circulation, what would break. What would bend. What would simply have to learn new trousers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe invoices,\u201d said the clerk, instantly. \u201cMy desk. The parts of the city that like to authorize confetti. Peel & Prosper\u2019s consulting deck. The kind of gala you attend in shoes that want you to sit down immediately. Quorum\u2019s faith in chairs. You. Also, possibly, any gathering larger than a pantry if somebody with malice tries to make it into a weapon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw a weaponized absence,\u201d Kestrel said, surprised by how bitter the picture looked when she painted it aloud. \u201cWhen nobody laughed, everyone got tired enough to accept doors being installed where they used to walk. Let the laughter go. Let the fog have opinions without invoices. We\u2019ll build something else for emergencies that actually addresses emergencies and not enthusiasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cName the new default,\u201d the machine typed, impertinent in the way of a device that had started a union and gotten away with it. \u201cMachines are happier when named. Humans, too, but you call it something else.\u201d\n\nHe did not want to call it Hope because there are only so many times you can pour that word over a wound and pretend it is antiseptic. He did not want to call it Freedom because freedom had been dragged around behind too many cars lately. He settled on the word Underlaugh because it felt like a private river that learned to share and because it would offend exactly the people he wanted to attend the next council and argue their best. Kestrel grunted approval and added a clause that would allow specific block captains to flip the emergency filter if a crowd became cruelty accompanied by matches. The clerk stamped the paper twelve times with a stamp that had been hand-carved from a spoon. The machine accepted the program, ripped the word Quorum politely off the old authorization like a bit of lace you save for patching, and printed a new set of tickets for the laughter\u2019s wayfinding.\n\nIt didn\u2019t all shift at once. Nothing worthwhile obliges the impulse toward montage. But the fog brightened as if someone had complimented its plume. A festival two neighborhoods over that had been threatening to behave became honest about its games. A morning show tried to be less venomous and discovered they had human tongues and not blades. Lara texted a small series of clapping hands and then a question: Will you come out onto the steps and tell the people with clipboards that this is a pilot? He sent back: It\u2019s a valve. She replied: I need a word with a consonant the press can put on a bar chart. He typed: Underlaugh. She wrote: You are not easy to print. Thank you.\n\nChortle appearing on the theater\u2019s edge was a surprise and was not. He had the air of a person who had rediscovered milk in coffee and wanted credit for the invention. He watched Kestrel with a respect he hid behind compliments about her braid. He complimented Nico on his sense of timing and did not mention that the chairs had just had a small, coordinated fit. He said WorldStart was prepared to launch a sub-brand called WeatherKind that would sell umbrellas that told jokes you could record yourself and asked for a blessing that wasn\u2019t a blessing. Nico told him to sell umbrellas to people who stood in the rain in order to be seen, and let the rest of the city borrow from each other.\n\n\u201cQuorum will sulk,\u201d Chortle said, and there was something almost wistful in it, the way you talk about an old boss who would have been excellent if not for his mouth. \u201cThey do not like it when pipes turn back toward the people who wash their hands in them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can get used to it,\u201d Kestrel said, as if that were a chore and not a policy. \u201cWe did.\u201d\n\nHis grandmother did not wait for him to finish being clever on the steps. She had gone to check on the transformer under the bridge with a basket of biscuits and a minimum of witnesses. He arrived, later, as the light tried on evening, and found her seated on an upturned crate like a queen who had refused to be bothered by chairs. The humming had changed timbre. It had become less endless and more old song. April crouched with her, knees up, making a face at the way the concrete tickled her shins, and Lara, who hated to give anything away, had eased her back against a pillar with the look of a person who knows there are only so many chances in a day to be a human in public and had chosen one.\n\n\u201cIt hatched,\u201d Nell said, nodding at the transformer with the pride of a midwife. \u201cIt took its time because letters have to decide what they\u2019re going to be. It wasn\u2019t a chick. It wasn\u2019t a permit. It was a key, and not to a lock. The kind you put in a person when you want them to be able to close the door behind them without feeling like they\u2019ve betrayed anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat door,\u201d he asked, ducking under and feeling the hum carry up his arm to a nerve that only fired when someone told him he had done a useful thing.\n\n\u201cMine once,\u201d she said, not sorrowing in any obvious way, which was her secret magic and his inherited curse. \u201cHers later. Yours now if you need it. It gives the bearer the right to leave a room where keeping is no longer what you are doing but only what you are acting. It breaks nothing except expectations. It is not to be used except when you cannot do otherwise. It fits in your pocket and weighs nothing until you need it.\u201d\n\nThe metal piece she pressed into his palm was warm with transformer and old guilt. It had no teeth, which made him think for a sharp second of all the things that have done their damage without biting. April watched his face in the way people only do when they\u2019re too tired for pretense and too fond for decency. Lara had her hands in her pockets because sometimes you need to keep your fingers from chiming. Kestrel arrived late, bringing the smell of rain and rehearsed restraint, and sat on the edge of the crate as if it had been set there to get her height exactly where it needed to be.\n\nHe did not ask the question that had been performing somersaults at the back of his mouth for three days. He asked a different one and found it came out like an apology that had decided to do useful work. \u201cWhy did you and she do it without me,\u201d he said, even though he knew that this city would never be gentle with the answer. \u201cTwenty years. Letters in machines. Keys hatched under bridges. I would have made tea. I would have fetched chairs. I would have asked questions you could have answered or fed to pigeons. You let me grow up thinking keeping was something done by other people with hats and clipboards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe let you grow up,\u201d Nell said, and if there was any cruelty in it, it was the kindness\u2019s shadow. \u201cIf you had come to the machines as a child with your mouth open for the first drink, you would have swallowed the city and never tasted your own tongue again. You do not owe us forgiveness. You owe us soup sometimes. You owe us remembering that hero is not a noun. You owe us that when you leave\u2014because you will use that key one day\u2014to do it without needing us to tell you that leaving is not failure, it is just geography.\u201d\n\nHe carried the key as if it were a bird that had decided to trust. He tucked it in with the whistle and the banana pen and the note from the child about the rats and the token for sandwiches, and he realized his pockets had become a museum exhibit called Assorted Salvations. He wanted to tell Kestrel, in the dumb exact way we tell people about our pockets when we want them to understand our skins, but she was watching the river and he let her, because the river had adopted her for the next three minutes and he would not get in the way of that.\n\nThe next day the laughter did not stop, it simply forgot to be captured. Video of three teenagers dancing with shopping carts under fog that looked like a friend\u2019s breath went very small and very viral. The Sidekick Code Council managed to agree to dislike a clause and love a comma. Peel & Prosper announced a new initiative to pair bananas with yoga mats and tried to call it cultural heritage. The river stole a hat from a man who had never once laughed at himself and returned it when he convinced a toddler to stop crying without saying anything about bravery. Quorum grew very busy with lunches.\n\nMid-afternoon the Clearinghouse spit out a stack of tickets that looked like a surrender and smelled like cinnamon. The clerk carried them to the World House with a small, holy grin and a self-knitted scarf, and read them into the record during a session so boring people had brought puzzle books to stay awake. The tickets said: Underlaugh engaged. Fog considers being a citizen. Filter remains available for fires and speeches. Block captains empowered to decide when fun is a weapon. Laughter invoices reduced to advisories. Quorum removed from authorization path. Please bring biscuits.\n\nThey brought biscuits. Not because the machine had asked, though that helped. They brought them because nothing good lasts without crumbs. Granny Nell made a plate that could have fed a committee minus the one who always says no because he likes the shape of his lips when he does it. April set out a pile of napkins that had been printed with a world that had refused to sit still long enough to be printed. Lara stood by the plant and adjusted the cloth by a quarter inch because something about the sling made the leaves look steadier. Kestrel leaned against a pillar with a cup of tea that was not daring to pretend it could help and thus managed to.\n\nChortle showed up as if summoned by the smell of competence and knelt to say hello to a child who had gotten past the cordon because somebody had the good sense to let him do it. He looked up at Nico with a grinning fatigue that implied the price of the bananas had been paid in meetings. \u201cYou are not going to make money off this,\u201d he said, without rancor. \u201cYou are not even going to get the right kind of film for your re-election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a poster,\u201d Nico said, and he meant it all the way down to the wrench, and for a second Chortle looked homesick for a sentence he had not been allowed to say in a decade.\n\nThey were all very busy not saying the word mother out loud in case it spooked something. They were also very busy not acknowledging that the machine under the bridge still hummed the name Underkeep whenever anyone looked at it in a way that resembled wanting. They were also very busy with a pilot that did not photograph well and a bracket that had become steady and a plant that knew, in a way most rooms do not, that gossip saves lives.\n\nThe word came without ceremony on a Tuesday afternoon that felt like a rehearsal. A boy whose job it was to ride a bicycle between places with folded paper announced, in the doorway of the Sidekick Bureau, out of breath and pleased to be the messenger of his own story, that the helmets were not gone. They had moved their depot and found a new drain. He added, careful with his hands, that somebody had been seen walking at the edge of their shadows with a coat that did not change and a cake tin, and had not been swallowed. He added, nervous, that someone else had sold a map of chairs to a monkey board for a price that was the wrong kind of low.\n\n\u201cEverything again,\u201d Kestrel said, with the relief of not being bored and the grief of work. \u201cBut tilted. We go.\u201d\n\nThey went, this time with more than a wrench and a whistle. They went with an electrician walking backward and a river emissary on a bicycle, and April\u2019s notes stuck to her own sleeve because the fog had refused to carry stationery, and Lara\u2019s calm like a net that can hold a sharp fish, and two council members who had decided it was time to see whether code meant anything in bad light, and Chortle at a distance because he can only be useful for free in a ratio of one to ten. They went with the key in Nico\u2019s pocket and a promise in his mouth that did not yet know who it belonged to.\n\nThe depot had moved into a decommissioned laundry where old signs insisted you separate things the way people with calmer lives always advise. The helmets were there, practicing a choreography that would have been beautiful if it had even a single kindness within it. The false drain in this place was a throat that did not believe in pauses. The wires were wound like unplayed violins. The laughter had been siphoned off into jars that wouldn\u2019t open for anyone poor. On a wall in chalk an inventory wrote itself in a hand he did not like as if a person\u2019s shame had been trained to write cursive.\n\nThey could not fix it in an afternoon. They fixed one thing cleanly: they convinced the building to remember its own plan. Nico put his cheek to a pipe the way you do when you want someone to tell you what their parents did, and he found the line under the floor, older than Quorum, older than the Act, older even than the false drains. He tapped it. Kestrel tapped next. The river hummed under the bricks like a cat who knows it has been invited into the kitchen. The line responded and flexed and then, with a slightly smug sigh, reconnected to the city\u2019s idea of itself. It did not dump the helmets into holes. It did not spill their wire into the street. It simply diverted the path from pity pit to public. The jars of laughter refused to stay sealed. The fog arrived, laughed once, and left for a block where people had been having trouble remembering what sunlight did. The helmets, faced with a room that had lost its appetite for their geometry, looked suddenly tired. One sat down and removed his hat. He had hair the color of someone you forgive and hands that had been told too often they were only good for closing.\n\nOn the way back to the van, they passed a wall where someone had written in tall, unpressurized letters, THE WORLD IS NOT A SINGLE THING; DO NOT TRY TO KEEP IT, and someone else had written underneath, BUT DO KEEP ITS DRAINS, IN CASE, and someone else had added, AND ITS LAUGHTER, BECAUSE. He wanted to underline because and make the ink as stable as a well-installed bracket. He wanted to go home and tell his grandmother a joke before she told him a story. He wanted to lower the shade in the oath room and tie a new cloth around the plant that read we are not going to behave, and mean it.\n\nThat night, when the fog curled itself up on the windowsill and took a little sleep, he sat with Nell at the table and watched the jam machine working through the night in a patient stutter. She had taken apart a watch and laid all its gears in a circle like men at a public meeting. He told her everything again, because repetition is a kind of keeping, and she listened in the way of a person who knows that some stories need to hear themselves to harden. When he ran out of words she reached across and touched the place on his shirt where the key lay and nodded as if to say she approved of the shape it made.\n\n\u201cThursday is Wasp Day,\u201d she said, as if they hadn\u2019t earned it. \u201cI\u2019ve asked the wasps to hold their stings and show up in waistcoats. They agreed on the condition that you explain to the Sidekick Council why bodies are not automatic alibis. Bring them cake. The wasps, not the Council. The Council should fast. Tell them if they cannot tell the difference between being obeyed and being listened to, they cannot tell the difference between verbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring cake on my head,\u201d he said, and she nodded because some sentences come true when you don\u2019t make a face at them. \u201cAnd when Quorum invites me to another brunch?\u201d\n\n\u201cBite their napkins,\u201d she said, and went back to the gears. \u201cMake a nest in their silverware. Tell their forks there is a better table across town. Wear your shoes. Don\u2019t step where the ink wants you to. Put the word under in your pocket. Learn a new song for the plant. Sleep.\u201d\n\nHe tried. He dreamed of the transformer under the bridge hatching envelopes that flew to their addresses on small, worried wings. He dreamed of the typewriter in the Clearinghouse learning to giggle at its own jokes and then deciding it was undignified and giggling harder. He dreamed of Kestrel unsnapping her braid and a clause falling out. He dreamed of Chortle with a banana that did not even make a performative case for itself. He dreamed of a city named Underkeep entering the room and asking if anyone had a spare chair. In the dream he said no, all the chairs are liars, sit on the floor, and the city did, and the floor held, and someone brought biscuits because they had learned you cannot do this without crumbs.Chapter 10\n\nMorning arrived done up in commas and did not apologize for its clauses. The fog had learned not just how to flirt but how to leave politely, and its jokes now landed like kindnesses at crosswalks. Brasshaven wore a mood that made storefronts open a fraction earlier and monkeys in ties glance at their reflections as if wondering whether sincerity might be a skill to practice on lunch hours. The laughter no longer queued for invoices; it ran errands, and in the alleys it traded recipes for how to survive a meeting that wants you to become an anecdote. Nico woke to the sound of the kettle speaking in proverbs and the jam machine purring as if it had adopted a philosophy. On the table, his grandmother had left a scrap of paper that said if they try to sell you your own verbs back, ask for a receipt, which was less a warning than a map folded wrong on purpose.\n\nHe did not make it past the second sip of tea before Lara called, her voice balanced like a tray in a crowded room. She said Quorum had gone to ground in a building they hadn\u2019t used in public since the Year of the Promising Umbrella. She said a new office had been conjured by committee and then discovered tucked under a staircase with a fresh coat of authority: the Registry of Actionable Verbs. She said the Registry was issuing licenses that would assign to world leaders the right to deploy certain verbs in conjunction with sidekicks, and that the pilot for \u201cNo\u201d was already live. People would have to apply to say no in contexts Quorum defined as strategic, and the application would include a box for justification longer than the breath you had to take before using the word. \u201cThey\u2019re making grammar into a permit,\u201d Lara said, and her calm did not quite conceal the part of her that had wanted since childhood to stand on a table and tell adults to stop touching language with sticky hands.\n\nGranny Nell, tightening her bun into a promise, did not wait for permission to be meddlesome. She assembled a satchel with the quickness of muscle memory and included the jam machine as if it were a distant cousin who did well at weddings. She added a spool of string, a roll of labels that read property of no one, two paper hats that would be cake later if need be, and a wrench wrapped in a dishtowel because some tools prefer modesty. She mentioned in passing that the Registry lived under the library in a vault called The Lexicon with a door that had been designed by a person who believed locks should be moral lessons. \u201cIf the door tells you a story,\u201d she said, as if arranging chairs, \u201cinterrupt it. Stories love that if you do it kindly.\u201d\n\nThe World House had been watching itself lately, suspicious of mirrors. The plant in the oath room adjusted its leaves toward the part of the ceiling where secrets liked to gather and let one drop like a hint. Kestrel read the motion as if it were a memo and looked up; she had begun to keep a list of the plant\u2019s opinions and had stopped being embarrassed about it. April arrived with a packet of biscuits labeled educational material, which would get past two levels of security more easily than any memo, and Lara produced passes that did not technically exist and handed them out with the air of a person flinging seeds at a paved lot while believing stubbornly in roots.\n\nThe Municipal Library was a broad-shouldered building that had learned contempt for shoe squeak. Its lions had been repaired twice and now wore the sort of expression statues put on when they have decided to forgive their admirers. Inside, the air had a candor that made ballpoint pens nervous. The Lexicon door was exactly where Nell had said, at the bottom of a stair that had memorized every ankle that had ever hesitated. The door did not have a handle so much as an invitation. Lines of text were chiseled into the brass in tidy rows and then interrupted by a sentence that refused to finish because it was waiting to hear whether the person standing before it deserved an ending. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those,\u201d Kestrel observed, feeling for the seam where doors and performances part company. \u201cTell it a story about tools,\u201d Nell recommended, lifting her chin so her municipal plum lip could glare down the engraving.\n\nHe told the door about the first time he had stripped a thread and saved it anyway with patience instead of force. He told it about the drain under the Vulcan Depot and how false runs discover themselves in your hands when a rumor has been doing the engineering. He told it about the bracket under the World House and the feeling in his forearm when metal consented to be reasonable. Halfway through, the door sighed as if relieved to be allowed to stop auditioning for itself and unlatched with a theatrical click that tried and failed to be demure. They went in together, close enough for their shoulders to agree.\n\nThe Registry did not look like a trap until you noticed how many filing cabinets had been trained to consider themselves architecture. Desks were arranged like chess pieces that had memorized two strategies and refused to be ashamed of it. Clerks moved with the efficiency of a game you cannot win and forget to stop. In the center of the room perched a device that had not decided whether it was a loom or a printing press and would not be pinned down. It hummed. It rearranged stacks of cards as if playing an energetic patience alone. Above it, on a lattice of wires, words hung to dry. They glowed faintly with ownership. NO had a hook through it and a tidy tag. REFUSE sat in a basket as if it were fruit with rules. ENOUGH lay very still, which felt like a threat.\n\n\u201cWelcome to regulation,\u201d said a man with the grooming of someone whose hair had voted against reform twice. He wore a badge that read Acting Registrar in an italic that wanted to be admired. \u201cWe are here to protect the citizenry from the misuse of decisive language. Verbs move crowds. We assign them. We prevent collateral metaphors.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour verbs are hung by their necks,\u201d Kestrel said, so conversationally the room took a second to notice the cruelty she was pointing at. \u201cAlso, your commas are sulking.\u201d\n\nThe man smiled the smile of a person who had complained to management about semantics and won a framed apology. He explained how the permit system would work with the ease of someone calling a poison by its brand name. Leaders, approved by the Registry and advised by Quorum, would file a request to deploy, say, stop in association with a mass gathering. The Registry would calibrate the request against an index of approved outrages and authorized delights, then return a license stamped with a duration and an emotional tax to be collected later via sanctioned festivals. Sidekicks would be allowed access to a subset of these licensed verbs depending on their photogenic risk. Anyone found to be using a restricted verb in an unsanctioned context would be fined a moment and assigned a white paper. \u201cIt\u2019s all very civilized,\u201d the Registrar concluded, with that special tone people use when they have taken something living and scrubbed it with words like civilized until it forgets to breathe.\n\nLara had put on the face that saved you from embarrassment when someone speaks nonsense with conviction. April had put a biscuit on the corner of the Registry\u2019s loom as if softening would travel through metal. Granny Nell composed her expression into a recipe you never shared except with stubborn radiators. Nico felt the whistle against his sternum and considered the tonality of this room. He imagined blowing and hearing drawers fling themselves open in a tantrum. He imagined slapping property of no one on every hanging word and watching hooks fall out of their letters like teeth that had been lying for a living.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to apply,\u201d he said, and the device, thirsty for script, hiccuped at the novelty of someone in this room declining an index. \u201cWe\u2019re here to remind you that verbs belong to mouths. They come with breath included. No is not a municipal resource. It\u2019s a spine. You do not sign spines out and then fine them for touching the air without gloves.\u201d\n\nThe Registrar produced a document that had trained itself to be charming in the first paragraph and then got down to business. It cited the clause in the Important Crime-Fighting Act that allowed committees of sufficient seating to regulate rhetorical devices during states of declared civic gusto. It referenced the Year of the Unpersuasive Parade and the time a mid-level nuisance had sung a city into doing stupid, kind things for a week. It referenced, without humor, the bee incident. \u201cWe are not censoring,\u201d he said, which is what people always say right before they do. \u201cWe are coordinating. If you wish to use refuse at scale, you will refrain from improvisation.\u201d\n\n\u201cRefusal without improvisation is just bureaucracy in an evening gown,\u201d Nell murmured, and the Registrar pretended not to hear because he had never yet managed to win an argument with a woman wearing confectionery on her head.\n\nKestrel leaned on the nearest cabinet with the familiarity of someone in a storeroom who knew which boxes had mice, and she described, without raising her voice, what happened to a crowd when leaders took away their verbs. She told them about helmets. She told them about a false drain and a pity pit and what happens when you make humiliation into infrastructure. She told them about a comma restored and a plant that listened and how people breathed different when their words came back to them unsupervised. While she spoke, Lara rearranged her papers so that the least interesting ones ended up on top, discouraging admiration. April quietly emptied the Administrator\u2019s dish of peppermint tension pellets onto a napkin so no one would try to chew serenity into their teeth.\n\nThe Registrar moved to a switch on the loom, a little lever designed for ceremonial deference. He flicked it and showed them what the device could do. On the wire above, NO brightened, was weighed, and dimmed to a tolerable hue. REFUSE fluttered its thousand meanings and had three shaved off for neatness. The labels rattled; the loom printed a permit with lace on the corners. It was, Nico observed with a nausea so precise it made his palms damp, beautiful. This was the kind of bureaucratic beauty that kills. He reached into his pocket not for the whistle but for the key and felt its shape like the outline of a decision. Not yet. Keys are not for rooms where you can still stand up without lying to yourself, his grandmother had once said while balancing a cake nobody ate because it had been too handsome to live. He put the key down inside his chest again and instead took out a label.\n\nProperty of no one looked small on the loom\u2019s casing and achieved the kind of quiet that has teeth. It attached itself to the machine with an obedience that felt like betrayal\u2014for two seconds\u2014and then became the most natural sticker that surface had ever worn. The hum changed key because even devices have egos. Beneath it, the old soapstone tiles made a small, encouraging noise, as if the building itself had been waiting for somebody to call ownership impolite. \u201cDo not vandalize,\u201d the Registrar said evenly, reaching for a form that had been designed exactly for this eventuality. \u201cPlease cite grounds.\u201d \u201cGravity,\u201d Nell said, setting the jam machine on the desk and pulling its lever like a priest with different hobbies. \u201cAnd hospitality.\u201d\n\nThe jam machine, good at peculiar emergencies, produced not jam but a thin, shimmering film that looked like puree and behaved like amnesty. When April slid it under the loom\u2019s intake rollers, the device snorted the way equipment does when you feed it something it wasn\u2019t designed to eat and discovered a taste for unruliness. The film adhered to the next set of permits, erased their adjectives, and returned them to the world as blank invitations. Lara, never one to be left without paperwork, took the freshly cleaned permits and wrote in careful, legal hand, Community Notice: You already owned No. Use with care and generosity. The Registry was scandalized and, being a device of procedure, started looking for step two of scandal.\n\nKestrel\u2019s scandal was the one that matters, which is to say she opened a drawer that had never been opened by anyone with muscle, and the noise of it cracked the room\u2019s porcelain composure. Inside lay lengths of chain. Each link had a word stamped on it, verbs that had been put into harness: Obey. Comply. Behave. Accompany. She lifted a chain the way nurses lift instruments in old movies and held it in the light. The words gleamed with a servility that made Nico\u2019s throat close. \u201cThis is supposed to be metaphor,\u201d the Registrar said, and his voice finally let a little of itself out, tattered and uncertain. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to pick it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hung No on a hook,\u201d Nico said, and the machine, sulky, spat the truth onto the platen in a font you couldn\u2019t argue with. \u201cWe are going to spoil your metaphors until they retire.\u201d\n\nThey could not shut the Registry down cleanly because the Registry had long, careful roots. But they could tilt. They could retune. Lara found the authorization for the looming of No and filed a form revoking Quorum\u2019s seat in the chain of approvals, citing the plant\u2019s rights to shade. April called in four librarians who had a longstanding grudge against decorative punctuation and set them to work handwriting new defaults on the paper the Registry had intended for pronouncements. Nell moved through the room with the serene arrogance of someone who has reinvented dinner when the stove exploded, peeling property of no one labels and affixing them to verbs with a measured rhythm that made clerks steady their hands rather than slap them away. Kestrel, the least sentimental among them, climbed a ladder and cut the hooks until No fell and REFUSE stopped pretending to be fragile. The words did not fly. They stood up and walked back into pockets, which is how verbs prefer to travel when you\u2019ve bothered to ask them.\n\nChortle arrived exactly wrong and perfectly timed, bearing a tray of coffee and a facial expression that had gone to two rehearsals and never met the scene partner. He took in the room, the chain, the labels, the jam machine drying its conscience, and whistled softly between fine incisors. \u201cOh dear,\u201d he said, setting the tray down on a ledger like a picnic on a grave. \u201cQuorum is going to call this vandalism, theft, and a branding disaster. From me they will want an argument about fences. From you they will want a narrative in which you tripped and landed on a lever. From themselves they will want a reason the public doesn\u2019t love you for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could give them a banana,\u201d Nell suggested in a voice as kind as salt. \u201cTell them it\u2019s a theory. Tell them they peel it the wrong way. Tell them the city does not eat bananas for its breakfast. It eats meetings and must be fed reality for dessert.\u201d\n\nSomething in Chortle\u2019s face conceded before his mouth did. He glanced at the loom, noted the sticker, and did the one useful thing he could without compromising the part of him that needed to survive in expensive rooms. He rotated the tray so the cups faced the Registrar and said in a tone sappy with small talk that the Registry would need to suspend operations while they logged the interruption, paperwork being paperwork. Suspended operations meant the room had to stop making decisions until it had told itself a story it could stand to live with. It bought an hour, and in that hour Lara did what a person like her does when you hand her a crack in the plaster: she widened it into an entrance.\n\nThe Lexicon\u2019s ceiling had always been proud of the words it held. It had, for decades, been a net that caught phrases before they fell into lawsuits. Now it sagged like a cloud making a point, and as the loom\u2019s rhythm faltered the whole apparatus that kept verbs in conjugation with permission hiccuped and then leaned into its own tiredness. Aboveground, the library exhaled and people reading in carrels looked up, startled by a hush that felt like an apology for having taken so long. Across the city, places where \u201cNo\u201d had been rusted shut tried their handles and found the hinges had been oiled by morning fog.\n\nHe would have liked a tidy ending and a cupcake. He got a memorandum from Quorum that called him reckless in excellent cursive. He got, five minutes later, the kind of weather that has thought through its reasons. A front rolled in with the manners of a debutante and the intentions of a union. It was a polite storm. Rain fell in neat lines as if drafted by an intern who had been told to respect property lines. Lightning did not crack; it gently annotated. The wind insisted on \u201csir\u201d and \u201cma\u2019am\u201d with a frequency that made strangers on corners smile in helpless discomfort. The forecast described it as intermittent courtesy with a chance of exasperation. The polite storm parked itself over the World House and waited to be invited inside.\n\nThe Oath room absorbed the drizzle in its shade like a plot. The plant rustled and did not flinch when a raindrop found its leaf, which was all the blessing he needed. They lowered the shade again, slow enough that the air could adjust. People came\u2014not invited, exactly, but welcomed by the floor. Sleepers from the trambed. Librarians smelling of paper and dust considered divine. Young sidekicks with capes folded under their arms so as not to conjure wind. Old sidekicks in civilian jackets with their code thick in the creases. Someone\u2019s baby who would remember none of it and all. The Sidekick Code Council filed in and pretended not to have crumbs on their laps from biscuits they hadn\u2019t eaten because adrenaline can be a poor friend to appetite.\n\nHe told the room what they had done with verbs and what they planned not to do with chairs. He introduced a proposed addition to the Code in language that did not apologize for being plain: silence shall be considered rest and not consent; pauses shall belong to the people who take them; no is not a noun we can collect and rent back at a discount. The polite storm tapped its umbrella against the window as if to say it had notes. Kestrel spoke once and told the Council that she had carried too many people out of events where someone with a title had interpreted silence as permission and used it like rope. Lara did the arithmetic out loud so people in chairs could nod and feel competent. April worked the room as sugar does when you put it on tongues and watch hard stares soften into receptive faces. Nell sat under the plant, which had decided to wear its cloth like a ribbon for mischief, and watched three generations relearn what breath does between phrases.\n\nQuorum\u2019s emissary did not come to that session in the flesh. He sent a letter that had learned to be a gentleman and a courier with a hat he clearly wanted back. The letter asked, softly, whether the Keeper would consider restoring order to rhetoric. It offered brunch. It offered a seminar on de-escalation of verbs. It suggested, as if the idea had not already exhausted everyone in the room, that perhaps the city could agree to use No only with supervision and Yes always in public. Nico read it in full because he disliked the way skipping sentences rots the gums, and then he folded it, slid it under the plant\u2019s pot, and decided to stop answering mail in a voice that did not taste like his. \u201cWe are not in a relationship with your adjectives,\u201d he said, and the polite storm, relieved of its purpose, began to consider raining somewhere else.\n\nThe Registry did not forgive them. It did not write a thank-you note. It began to reconfigure its chairs so you could only sit facing a wall. The loom, out of spite, learned a new stitch that made ribbons of complaint with lace borders. They would be dealing with its moods for months. But the hooks remained empty over No and REFUSE and ENOUGH, and the chains went back to being paper. That was not victory. It was day.\n\nThat night he went home dragging a bag that had become a sampler of absurdities. The key lay against the whistle with a tact that implied an after-dinner conversation. The banana pen had stopped squeaking and now played a note that suggested creative sabotage. The note from the child about rats had been unfolded and refolded so many times it had learned to be a talisman. He sat at the table and watched Nell take a sewing needle to a shirt she had decided would look better if it had known boats. She did not ask whether he had won. She asked whether the city had noticed, which was smarter.\n\n\u201cIt noticed,\u201d he said, remembering the way the verbs had stepped off their hooks and straightened their hems. \u201cIt noticed like a body remembering to breathe without being told. There will be letters. There will be storms that say please and mean stop. We can stand up to please.\u201d\n\nShe threaded the needle and bit the end of the thread like a magician. She said that storms are theater with homework and not to be fooled by their diction. She said she had spoken to the transformer under the bridge and it had hummed back a suggestion that sounded like someone making coffee properly. She said Underkeep was getting louder by becoming quieter, which is a trick some cities learn when they decline to be distinguished and choose instead to be lived in. Then she did the thing she did when the day had been full of performances and she wanted her grandson to live through a private scene. She took out a tin and lifted the lid and offered him a cookie that had been saved just because saving something makes it important, and he ate it, because that is what you do when you believe in drains.\n\nHe slept badly and better. He dreamed he was standing in the Registry again, but the machine had turned into a bridge and words were crossing, some with umbrellas, some with luggage, none with permits. He dreamed the plant in the oath room told him a secret and he couldn\u2019t wake up until he understood it wasn\u2019t a secret at all. He dreamed Quorum invited him to a gala where the chairs were tired of being sat on and went on strike, and everyone had to sit on the floor and discovered their spines could be useful. He woke to the polite storm\u2019s last apology tapping at the window and the sense that the floor under his feet had agreed to something.\n\nBy noon the helmets had made their first polite robbery. They arrived at a corner bodega wearing sashes that read We Regret The Inconvenience and took only exact change from the tip jar. They left a note that said This Has Been An Exercise In Adaptation. They bowed to the security camera and then took it because theater hates surveillance. Kestrel read the report out loud and made a noise in her throat that suggested the pleasure she takes in a competent opponent was at war with the importance of never feeding that pleasure. \u201cThey\u2019re learning,\u201d she said, as she slung the backpack that always looked like it contained an extra shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s when people get dangerous and interesting. Bring a biscuit. We will instruct them in other hobbies.\u201d\n\nThey found the helmets at the decommissioned laundry, sober as tax season, practicing smiles that would pass in rooms with carpets. The false drain had been patched and was now a false drain with a moral. The jars for laughter had been removed and replaced with a suggestion box labeled In-Kind, and Nico wanted to fill it with verbs that had learned to bite back. He did not blow the whistle. He did not make a speech. He asked the room whether anyone knew how to fix an unbalanced machine with a book and a string, and two helmets raised their hands, because criminality will eventually recruit competence if the job is to keep being possible. Kestrel set them to work roping off the pity pit so nobody fell into it by mistake. April posted a sign that said please do not contribute humiliation to this receptacle, thank you, and then wrote in smaller letters: contributions of courage accepted in aisle three. Lara took the name of every person who laughed when they didn\u2019t mean to. Chortle, at a cautious distance, ordered a round of coffee and insisted on paper cups, then wrote in the receipt memo line: for the return of verbs.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Oath room smelled of wet wool and argument. The Sidekick Code Council had reassembled to debate the breath clause now fully dressed in sentences. Those who had young voices argued it should have teeth and a curfew. Those with old voices reminded them that clauses are adopted like dogs and bite who they love if trained wrong. The bees did not come because they had been elsewhere convincing a school board that the word swarm need not be filed under panic. The plant flicked its cloth with a discreet flourish that made one man from Legal admit out loud that he admired flora. The polite storm finally left, flicking its hat brim at the door, and Brasshaven shook itself, grateful to be damp rather than lacquered.\n\nHe thought of the key all day like a pebble in a shoe that never quite found the sore it wanted. He did not know yet which door it fit because it didn\u2019t, not literally, and the city would not provide an instruction manual for a choice like that. He caught Nell watching him over her knitting with a look that contained instructions and refusal and a memory of carrying too much and a smile that promised she would forgive him for being slow if he didn\u2019t apologize for being careful. In the evening, he stood by the window and watched fog attempt comedy one more time for the late buses. The laughter came up from the street in a minor key, weary and available, almost a prayer. He thought: this job is not a noun. He said aloud, to the kettle, which had become his confessor, \u201cWe will make the next tilt. Then we will sleep. Then we will steal back another bracket.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Quorum produced a new punctuation. They unveiled it at a breakfast designed by someone who had fallen in love with triangles. It was a semicolon rewrite of the sidekick clause that would bind partner to hero for the duration of a declared narrative. The semicolon was a polite leash. It suggested sophistication while attaching one spine to another with silk. The Moderator held it up and the room applauded because rooms like that cannot help loving a semicolon. \u201cNo,\u201d Nico said, not with a permit, not with lace. He said it the way you tell a dog to drop a chicken bone before it makes itself sick. He carried the word like a bowl of soup. He did not spill.\n\nThe plant approved with a rustle. The registry, newly uncertain about its job description, sent back a receipt it did not understand for a transaction no one could process. The polite storm, bored with itself, went off to bother suburbs. Granny Nell wrote a list of groceries that included courage and onions and the phrase whatever is on sale in the department of practical magic. Kestrel sharpened her braid with a pin. Lara wrote a memo that was actually a love letter to pauses. April printed stickers that said silence is a blanket, not a gag, and dared the donors to peel one off without liking it.\n\nHe did not use the key that day. He walked around with it like a promise he had not earned and refrained from learning how it would feel in his hand when the door he needed to close presented itself. He thought, instead, about screws and couplings, and about gaps. He wondered how much of keeping was just this: removing hooks from words, putting commas back where they could do their old work, teaching storms to be less polite, and refusing to sit on chairs that prefer to talk. The city might want a different song tomorrow. Fine. He would learn it, hum it down a drain, and see what came up in the bowl.\n\nBy nightfall, Brasshaven had decided to be a small town for the space of two hours. People waved across intersections with an intimacy that embarrassed them later. Monkeys in shirts walked home with their jackets over their arms like men in paintings who had just discovered they had been wrong about something and were glad. The bridge hummed a list of rooms it would like to see repainted. The jam machine made a soft contented noise and spit out, without fuss, exactly enough sweetness for toast. Nell put her hand on her grandson\u2019s cheek as if to check for a fever in a story and told him with the tranquil brutality of love that tomorrow someone would demand an answer he didn\u2019t want to give, and when he refused, he would feel very good and then very tired, and he should buy good socks.\n\nHe laughed because socks were the kind of ordinariness that keep you from climbing onto tables every day, and then he folded himself onto the sofa with a tiredness that had stopped being performance and started being the cost of verbs. The window looked out onto a sliver of sky doing its best impression of a reasonable person. Somewhere under that sliver a door waited. Somewhere above it another bracket did not yet know it was about to be told what decency looks like in metal. Somewhere between, a plant practiced gossip and a transformer hummed cities into the future tense and a registry began to wonder if it had been built for a better purpose after all and had simply not been asked. He fell asleep with the whistle under his palm and the sense that if this was what keeping was, he could bear it until he couldn\u2019t, and then the key would weigh what it needed to, and in the morning, he would put his shoes on and go be inconvenient in the name of drains.",

                              "content": "The first time Nico Fawcett watched a silverback in a pinstripe suit slam a gavel, he was elbow-deep in a drain that was older than the company itself. He had turned the handle on his torch so it spat a plane of light, white and hot, into a rusted throat of welded bends. Bleach ghosted the air. Water fretted around his forearms, warm and resentful, as if the building begrudged him for knowing its secret. From the grate below his boots he could hear the monkey board\u2019s voices, overlapping with a rain of knuckles on polished teak.\n\n\u201cMotion. Motion,\u201d grunted the silverback, whose portfolio included something like Nutrient Futures and also, according to rumor, the underground distribution of laughter at investor breakfasts. \u201cWe do not entertain motions that involve extra nap times.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not,\u201d repeated the orangutan CEO in a tone that says we, we, we until the pronoun turned into a leash. He lounged under a chandelier, one long arm propped on a stack of legal pads. A red scarf hugged his throat; his tie pin was a miniature banana encrusted with diamonds arranged in a swirl that had cost three interns their annual holiday stipends.\n\nA capuchin in a midnight blazer leafed through a prospectus larger than herself. The pages made a sound like a money river. \u201cNevertheless,\u201d she said, flicking a sticky note with earnest precision, \u201cwe\u2019re under pressure. The city wants our help with the Sidekick Compliance Plan.\u201d\n\nThe word dropped into the room like a cereal box clinking onto a tile floor. Sidekick. You heard it everywhere, like birdsong and sirens and the hiss of the espresso machine in the lobby where an attendant in a bow tie shaved soft rolls of chocolate onto cappuccinos for the board when they needed to sharpen their thinking. Sidekick. The world had turned what used to be a friend who shows up too late to mop blood off the sidewalk into a title. It had a card. It had a lanyard. It had a low-budget jingle.\n\nNico unlatched a second length of pipe, his wrench making a blunt, pleasant sound. He had been plumbing for the better part of a decade and learned to tell what made a building clear its throat. There were the clogs that came from executives flushing contracts they regretted\u2014soggy vowels and consonants gumming the U-bend\u2014and there were the banana peels that had grown into shapes like questions. The bananas fell into two categories, bros. He could tell by the oil on the skin if they were imported from the consortium plantations run by squirrel monkeys out in the archipelago or if they were Black Stripers, the fancy kind with built-in vanilla notes. Today they were the fancy kind. The kind that clung to the metal like old opinions.\n\nHe listened to the meeting through the floor because he had no taste for radio preaching. The drains were as good as any station. He could hear them discuss tax holidays in a dialect of lawyers and tail-thumps. He could hear a subordinate sneeze and be reprimanded for violating the rhythm. His elbows got wetter.\n\n\u201cSidekicks are for show,\u201d said a young proboscis monkey in sales who had the ruinous good looks of a person destined to get demoted twice and then bounce back into consultancy. \u201cThe Important Crime-Fighting Act specifies they can\u2019t act alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one acts alone,\u201d the orangutan sighed. \u201cThat is the point of the act. The point is compliance. The point is that the public sleeps knowing only world leaders wield sidekicks, and world leaders never sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey nap,\u201d the capuchin said, and the room tipped into laughter that put teeth on display. Apes think you can\u2019t tell what they\u2019re thinking, but when they smile their grief shows through, quick as a coin flash.\n\nNico\u2019s wrench slipped and sang against a bolt. He thought: sidekicks, sidekicks, sidekicks. It was in his head every morning, the way cold water knows where your bones are thin. The city of Brasshaven had turned all of it into a system\u2014anything worth loving into a system eventually. If you wanted to fight crime in Brasshaven, you had to do it through the program. If you wanted a sidekick\u2014and you did, because a lone vigilante got laughed into perjury\u2014you had to be assigned one by the Sidekick Bureau. And the Sidekick Bureau served only one office: the Keeper of the World, a position mostly ceremonial if you believed the posters, mostly tyrannical if you listened to the late-night pirate podcasts, and mostly mysterious if you listened to no one but the river. World leader. Sidekick. The law braided the two into something like a leash. The entire arrangement was supposed to stop gangsters building brand identities and politicians cutting deals with heroes. It did none of that. So far, it had created a very lucrative chain of consulting firms that advised mayors on cape-management.\n\nHe twisted and pulled, and the blockage surrendered a little with a sound like a sigh.\n\n\u201cCareful, Mr. Fawcett.\u201d\n\nThe voice floated down through reflected gold. Nico recognized it: the voice belonged to a chimpanzee he only knew as Chortle, Head of Corporate Communications at Peel & Prosper International, owner of seventeen identical blue suits, ringmaster of band-aid solutions. Chortle leaned down through the hole the company had carved into the floor to accommodate an emergency maintenance shaft and grinned, teeth very white, very straight. He had a tin of candied ants in one hand. He popped one. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have press down there in twenty. The pipes cannot be weeping like my uncle at tax time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll hold.\u201d Nico brushed a thread of lime scale from his sleeve. \u201cYour problem is second-floor fun. You\u2019ve got too much peel in your churn.\u201d\n\nChortle peered at his reflection in the wrench and took a second to consider a rebuttal, which he decided against because he liked sounding as if he didn\u2019t touch actual objects. \u201cIf you could\u2026 align the situation with a timeline that suits the narrative, we\u2019d be grateful.\u201d\n\nNico nodded. Align. He thought of his grandmother\u2019s old fridge, with its humming that grew startlingly loud at three a.m., as if the metal had decided domesticity was not enough and it would rattle itself to the moon. He thought of the little note she\u2019d left that morning propped up against the bag of day-old buns she\u2019d wrapped for him in a newspaper comic: Don\u2019t forget, Thursday is Wasp Day. It was never Wasp Day. She said a lot of things that weren\u2019t true and half of them came true by accident anyway.\n\nHe took the rag from his pocket and wiped a line of clean on the pipe, then ran his hand along it, feeling for grit. Plumbing teaches you to read with fingers. It had been six months since he\u2019d been fired from the city water authority for telling the deputy director that the magical thinking around budget shortfalls should be taken to an actual magician. Since then he\u2019d freelanced for whoever called him at odd hours, and everyone did, because pipes did not read calendars. He had become, by accident, intimate with brass and porcelain in the offices where monkeys ran things. They paid in a currency that sometimes looked like money and sometimes looked like a helping hand you\u2019d better not take. He took the first. He took the second never. When cash was tight, he took bananas and resold them to human bakeries that made indulgent cream pies labeled with the helpful lie of artisanal provenance.\n\n\u201cDo you ever,\u201d a voice said softly, \u201cget tired of repairing the same messes the same way?\u201d\n\nNico looked up, blinking; his torch flicked. The question had a warmth that did not belong to the board. It belonged to someone who wasn\u2019t allowed in the room and got in anyway. He saw the speaker above the hole: a human woman with hair like a waterfall when the water\u2019s tired. She wore an orange maintenance vest like his, but the stripe on hers was blue, and two little metal discs with the Bureau\u2019s crest winked from her collar. Sidekick Bureau. She had a pen behind her ear. She had a smudge of oil high on her cheekbone in a place you leave it on purpose.\n\n\u201cNot your problem, Bureau,\u201d he said mildly, because you get in less trouble when you sound precise.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s my problem,\u201d she replied, not without cheer. \u201cToday even your pipes are my problem because our new protocol says we can\u2019t deploy a junior assignment to any building with\u2014\u201d she consulted a card \u201c\u2014Category Three infrastructure deficiency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Category Two,\u201d he said, scandalized on behalf of pipes he would never admit he loved. \u201cMaybe Two-and-a-half if you count the executive washroom sauna, which I do, because we\u2019ve all seen the drain after somebody brings in a tray of iced eclairs.\u201d\n\nShe smiled. \u201cI\u2019m Lara Quill. Liaison. You\u2019re Nico Fawcett. Your grandmother terrifies and charms two of my aunts.\u201d\n\nHe wiped his hand on his pants and, feeling the unexpected itch of wanting to be impressive, shook. \u201cShe terrifies me, too.\u201d\n\nLara glanced over her shoulder. Behind her the board had stopped pretending not to watch the two humans. The orangutan\u2019s red scarf flashed like a warning. Chortle waved his tin of sugared ants at an assistant, and Nico watched a banana peel arc into a bin with the mathematical inevitability of rainfall. Lara leaned in. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a recruitment push.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor criminals?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor sidekicks. We\u2019re always short. The application form is new this quarter and has fewer opportunities to accidentally enroll a ferret. We require new pairings at the very top because that trickles down. Our mandate says: \u2018All heroes shall be assigned a sidekick by a world leader in accordance with the Charter.\u2019 You want to help? Become a world leader.\u201d\n\nIt came out like a joke and muscled into the room like a declaration. A golden bead of water fell from the pipe onto Nico\u2019s wrist and became a cold coin against his veins. He pictured himself on one of the sad billboards by the river where the candidates for Keeper of the World smiled teeth they had whitened on a payment plan. The last Keeper had been a mercurial rhesus with a taste for mango chutney and life coaches. She\u2019d resigned on live television when a baby howler monkey climbed onto the set and took a nap in her shoe.\n\n\u201cI fix sinks,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t keep worlds.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve read your fines,\u201d Lara said, which was not a flirtation in any language, but to be fair Nico spoke several kinds of sarcasm. \u201cI\u2019ve read the case you made to the municipal inspector about the copper theft ring that ran under the old tram line.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody had to make it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake this.\u201d She flicked a card at him; it thwacked against his chest and stuck momentarily to the damp fabric. \u201cApplications open for the interim Keeper\u2019s seat. You can\u2019t assign a sidekick unless you hold it. You want crime to stop happening to people without money? Run. If you do it and win, we\u2019ll assign your sidekick. Day one. You can pick from the top shelf. Not that there\u2019s really a shelf. It\u2019s more\u2026 a spreadsheet with drops of coffee on it.\u201d\n\nShe moved away before he\u2019d decided on a sneer or a snort. Chortle descended into the maintenance space with an acrobat\u2019s grace, pinstripes unruffled, as if chimp anatomy had been redesigned by a tailor. \u201cWe\u2019re having a launch,\u201d he told the air. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019ve heard of our new product.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeeled water?\u201d Nico said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re calling it WorldStart.\u201d Chortle\u2019s eyebrows, which were not technically eyebrows, lifted with an earnestness that would have been more impressive if he had not spent last month convincing the city that banana disposal fees were a museum grant-worthy cultural expression. \u201cIt\u2019s a program that helps world leaders succeed. Workshops. Retreats. Guided vision. Yoga with higher fiber. We\u2019re interviewing candidates. Every candidate gets a complementary\u2014complimentary? Both!\u2014sidekick assignment from the Bureau if they wish to look\u2026 robust. Photogenic.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a pair of pears,\u201d Nico said, irritated that he enjoyed his own metaphor. He thought of Lara\u2019s smudge of oil. He thought of the copper ring he\u2019d exposed by accident because when he lifted a tile to unclog a sink, six thieves popped up like daisies and tried to shove him back down. He thought of his grandmother\u2019s note about Wasp Day and how she once made a cake that was really a hat. \u201cI\u2019ll consider it,\u201d he lied in the tone of a man who has already put the card into his left pocket where the lining has a hole so things fall into the inside of the jacket and you find them years later and feel a grief you can\u2019t name.\n\nBy the time he finished, two hours later, the water had cooled and what had been a clog was only a memory of stubbornness. He reassembled the pipe and stood up slow, feeling the joints in his shoulders sing. Chortle clapped. The board clapped. They clapped like people who had only ever read about applause. Nico took his envelope\u2014heavy with the right kind of currency and a voucher for a smoothie he would never redeem because the attendant always looked at him like a plumber had not earned blueberries\u2014and left through a side door that felt like an apology.\n\nOutside, Brasshaven was the color of late-day metal. Buildings pushed into the sky like stubborn fruit. Monkeys haggled in alleyways over the price of gossip. Humans banged pots to keep pigeons from taking root in their hearts. Somewhere a busker played a harmonica so sadly even the lampposts leaned in. Nico\u2019s van, which had once been white and now possessed the color of a foggy rumor, dozed under a meter that said NO NEED TO PAY IF YOU BELIEVE IN YOURSELF, which a street artist had stenciled on six months ago and no one had bothered to remove because self-belief boosted local commerce.\n\nHe slotted the envelope under the seat with the others and drove the long way home through the Old Quarter, past the bakery where sugar lived as a philosophy, past the bar with the ceiling fans like tired angels, past the statue of the first Keeper of the World, a macaque with a thoughtful gaze and shoes that didn\u2019t fit because the sculptor loved the idea of discomfort eternally poised. In front of the statue, a group of protestors shook signs that said THE WORLD IS NOT A SINGLE THING; DO NOT TRY TO KEEP IT and IN MY DAY HEROES JUST WORE HATS.\n\nHis apartment sat above a tea shop that sold leaves at prices you only spent when you had just done something that made you feel like you might be a better version of yourself next week. The shopkeeper, Mr. Chi, nodded as Nico passed, and slid a bag of the cheap stuff into his hand as if exchanging contraband. \u201cFor the grandmother,\u201d Mr. Chi murmured, eyes lighted with the kindliness of a person who knows the uses of a kettle at three a.m.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Nico said, because you must accept small kindnesses or the big ones forget where to find you.\n\nHe unlocked two doors, turned his shoulder against the third, and stepped into his room. The window\u2019s view embraced a wall and a sliver of sky. Plants orphaned from long-ago attempts at optimism drooped from a shelf. On the table a small machine ticked; his grandmother had left it there last winter with a note that said for emergencies, and when he asked what kind, she had said the kind that involve jam, which did not clarify much. The machine had levers. It had a crank. It once spit out an egg.\n\nThe smell of something sweet greeted him like a hand to the back of his neck. He paused. He listened. \u201cGranny?\u201d he said, not loudly.\n\n\u201cNot my name.\u201d The voice that answered from the kitchen had laughter trapped in it. \u201cI am Madame Viper. I have stolen your jam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen who ate all the fig biscuits,\u201d he said, leaning in the doorway.\n\nHis grandmother stood on a stool wearing a floral dress that had belonged to somebody flamboyant in 1961 and never apologized. She was frosting a tower of cupcakes that leaned like a decision. The frosting was lime green. She wore it on one knuckle. She had white hair in a complicated bun that looked like something a pastry should aspire to.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she said. \u201cI made you a cake. To wear as a hat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I know. Wasp Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did remember.\u201d She lifted a cupcake and placed it carefully on the very top of the tower, which sighed but did not fall. \u201cIf you don\u2019t celebrate Wasp Day, they\u2019ll get offended and never sting you again. And then where would you be? I heard you were inside Peel & Prosper. Did you look them straight in their tiny, blinking souls? Did you show them you knew where the water went?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did. They are very attached to their peels.\u201d He slung his vest over a chair and stretched until his shoulders cracked. \u201cA woman from the Sidekick Bureau told me to become a world leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh good,\u201d his grandmother said, unperturbed. She hopped off the stool and moved with the kind of agility that made him remember she had taught him to climb trees and also fences and also silence. \u201cI signed you up.\u201d\n\nHe stared. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d She opened a drawer, removed a packet of candles, and fanned them like cards. \u201cYou always say you want to fix more than sinks. You always say the real blockage is violence with nice shoes on. So. I took the liberty of filing the preliminary papers.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou what?\u201d He felt the room tilt very slightly. The wall with the sliver of sky leaned closer as if wanting to hear gossip. \u201cGranny Nell, you can\u2019t just\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI did. It was all online. There were three captchas and one asked me to select squares that contained a car, which I correctly identified as trucks to be contrary. The page broke. I pressed back. A monkey in a chat window told me to be resilient.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hate online forms.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrue. Which is why I made Mrs. Chi\u2019s granddaughter do it. She is twelve. She knows what to click.\u201d She studied his face and then softened, as if the muscles around her eyes let go of something they had held. \u201cYou\u2019re not obliged. But you could. You could be Keeper. Or you could\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014hurl myself into a ravine,\u201d he suggested.\n\n\u201cYes, but then we\u2019d have to fish you out and all our cold-weather clothes would smell like ravines. Put a candle in this cupcake. It\u2019s not your birthday but it is your Tuesday.\u201d\n\nHe watched her, feeling that familiar twin: irritation as a fringe around awe. She had raised him on a small pension and a cupboard that always had exactly one jar of something interesting. It had been only the two of them since he was seven and the only picture he had of his parents was the one his grandmother refused to be ashamed of, which showed two young people with large ideas leaning against a boxy car painted daisy yellow. Every year on the day they drove away not coming back, his grandmother said, \u201cThey were ridiculous and brave,\u201d and they ate soup on the floor. She did not give speeches about fate. She gave speeches about lunch and how you should never close jars too tight because sometimes jars need to breathe.\n\nHe lit the candle because it was wise to do what she asked when the request was ridiculous. They ate sugar. She told him the story of the first time she\u2019d voted for Keeper, which involved a broken heel, a thunderstorm, and the late arrival of seven parrots who held the line for the polls with their wings.\n\n\u201cYou never tell me,\u201d he said, mouth green from frosting, \u201cwhy the monkeys run the corporations.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause someone has to,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd because when the chimps got the hang of jackets, everyone went soft. The monkeys were already organized for stealing mangoes from the market. It wasn\u2019t hard to pivot to derivatives. People like to watch a thing and call it natural.\u201d\n\nHe liked the way she said it, blunt as a hammer. He liked that nothing she said made him feel small for not knowing it first. He looked at the machine with the lever, which ticked up its mind like a clock. He looked at the card the Bureau woman had flicked into his chest. He looked at his hands, lined with someone else\u2019s work. A siren wailed in the distance, cried \u201cno\u201d to the street\u2019s \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to become a poster,\u201d he said, because fear often masquerades as a preference.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d she said, and patted his cheek with a tenderness that extracted his scowl like a splinter. \u201cYou\u2019re not easy to print.\u201d\n\nThat night, in bed with the window cracked to let in the sound of a city\u2019s arguments, he dreamt of a drain that emptied into the sky. He walked inside the drain. It smelled like lemon and also secrets. The monkeys clapped when he reached the top, not because they were glad to see him but because someone had told them that clapping would keep their hands from finding the truth. He woke with a start because a pigeon landed on his sill and looked in like an editor.\n\nIn the morning, the posters. They had gone up overnight with the unkind speed of glue. Candidates for Keeper of the World smiled tooth-baring smiles so polished they made you feel like a fingerprint. A proboscis in a crisp suit. A human with a jaw that looked engineered. A capuchin in a peach twinset and pearls that were probably the tears of people who had lived through prior administrations. A chimp with a tie that said I made a deal with an ocean. All of them had slogans that were not slogans. STABILITY IS A HELMET. KEEP THE KEEPING. YOU DESERVE MORE. YOU DESERVE LESS. A child had written MOM SAYS DON\u2019T on one with a marker and someone had tried to scrub it away and failed and the ghost of it still showed through: DON\u2019T.\n\nNico bought a paper\u2014habit, ritual, a way to feel like language mattered\u2014and there it was, on the fourth page, under Classifieds: candidates wanted. He found the application link. It took him to a site that said You\u2019re nearly there! and then made him find bicycles in nine squares and then asked him to describe his philosophy of time in 500 words or less, which made him disgusted with whoever had designed the thing and, more dangerously, interested.\n\nHe went to work. A call from a laundromat where the machines had achieved consciousness and expressed it by only accepting coins that had once been lucky; a call from a children\u2019s museum where a pipe had burst in a room labeled The Physics of Innocence and everything smelled like wet sneakers; a call from a restaurant where the ceiling was sweating because a kraken of grease had blossomed in the vent. In each place he did what he did and in each place he found a small stone of anger in himself where once there had been only water wearing away rock. He was tired of mopping up after the wrong kinds of accidents. He was tired of the way the program robbed language until hero meant we asked you to take on our fear for free.\n\nAt lunch he sat on a stoop and ate an egg sandwich he\u2019d wrapped in newspaper and found, balanced on the step beside him, a banana in a suit. A banana in a suit is, of course, a novelty pen handed out at events. This one had the logo of Peel & Prosper on it and when you clicked the top, it squeaked like a comment section. He thought of Chortle, of Lara Quill, of his grandmother\u2019s cupcakes leaning into decision, and he clicked the pen until a passing lemur said, \u201cHave mercy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry,\u201d he said, and put the pen in his pocket like a talisman, because sometimes even mockery must be kept for later.\n\nHe printed the application. He took it home. He laid it on the table the way you lay down a map to a place you are not ready to go. His grandmother drifted in behind him like a benevolent weather system.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll do it,\u201d she said, not unkindly.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t decided.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll decide. And then you\u2019ll do it, which is not the same. Don\u2019t confuse deciding with doing. People do. They so do. I once decided to learn the harp.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou did. You learned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI learned to carry one. It was full of bees.\u201d She winked, pleased with a history only she would retell that way. \u201cIf you run, we have to get you clothes that stop people\u2019s mouths from swallowing what you say at the hem. If you run, people will throw mud. I will domesticate the mud and make a pie. I will decorate the pie with the word \u2018Hmm.\u2019 If you run\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf, if, if,\u201d he said, not hating the way it sounded like the start of something.\n\nWhen he was a child she had taught him how to sink into the bath and hold his breath until the water was all a hum and no edges. \u201cUnder,\u201d she\u2019d told him when the world shouted. \u201cUnder until it goes quiet. Then up.\u201d He did that now, metaphorically, because a tub would not fit in his van.\n\nHe filled out the form. Name. Address. He wrote his answers to the ridiculous questions with a seriousness he did not owe them. Philosophy of time: I think it runs a little and then sits down. What will you keep of the world if elected: The parts that are tired of being interesting. Describe a moment of courage: I told a man who could fire me that his idea was a hazard and then I fixed it anyway. Do you have allergies: Bees, sometimes, but it depends on if they are in the mood.\n\nHe clicked submit and expected a trumpet or a hole in the floor and he got a tiny, tasteful banner that said Thank you. If you are chosen for interview, a courier will arrive. Please provide biscuits.\n\nHe waited. He didn\u2019t. He went out and ran a snake through a hairball the size of an apology. He went to the market and bought a bag of carrots he would forget to grate. He returned home and found a box on his doorstep with an enormous bow. The bow had its own shadow. The box had a sticker: From the Office of the Interim Keeper, with compliments.\n\nHe put the box on the table next to the jam machine. His grandmother came out of the kitchen wiping her hands on a towel she\u2019d embroidered with the words if no one\u2019s watching, that\u2019s still an audience. They looked at the bow the way you look at an animal you\u2019ve never seen before, with respect and a plan.\n\n\u201cOpen it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou open it.\u201d\n\nShe did not. She touched the edge and the bow sighed, satin against paper. He slid a finger under the lid and paused because his life had contained a reasonable number of bombs and only some of them were literal. He lifted.\n\nInside was an earnest amount of confetti, most of it biodegradable, according to the little slip that had the tone of someone who had learned not to be yelled at on weekends. Resting in the confetti was a pair of shoes. Polished. Brown, the shade of a new idea. Human shoes, size exactly his size. There was also a note:\n\nDear Candidate Fawcett,\n\nCongratulations on your application. The Office of the Keeper believes in wearing shoes that walk forward into conversations. Please accept these. Break them in by arguing with someone you love. Interviews will be conducted on Friday at the World House. Please bring biscuits.\n\nYours in keeping,\n\nThe Interim Keeper\u2019s Office\n\nPS: The Bureau has assigned you a preliminary pre-sidekick for photobacks. This is not binding. Please do not fight crime with the pre-sidekick. That is a violation.\n\n\u201cPre-sidekick,\u201d his grandmother said, rolling the words around in her mouth like toffee, examining their stick. \u201cPhotobacks. Bring biscuits. Oh I will bring biscuits. I will bring biscuits that will make them remove their watches.\u201d\n\nNico tried on the shoes and felt something happen to his calves. He stood taller because the shoes demanded it. He walked to the window and looked out at the sliver of sky, which had somehow not noticed that he had changed footwear. He took them off again because you do not want to get sticky frosting on shoes that are in sentences like \u201cour brand\u2019s forward-facing ambassadors.\u201d He sat. His grandmother went to fetch her good tin.\n\nIn the morning, true to the promise, the pre-sidekick arrived.\n\nShe came on a bicycle that had more chrome than sense. She wore a jacket so yellow it took your breath and gave it back improved. When she removed her helmet, her hair behaved as if being filmed. She leaned her bike against a hydrant as if hydrants were designed for that and climbed the stairs two at a time and knocked in a rhythm that said I know songs.\n\nNico opened. They regarded each other with the mutual suspicion of two people who have both fixed things for other people and discovered it is always the wrong thing. She said, \u201cI\u2019m April. I\u2019m a pre. Please do not take me anywhere with knives.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d his grandmother trilled from the kitchen, already halfway in love with the event. \u201cWe have biscuits. And cake. And cruel opinions about clothing, which we will not share. Come in. Take off your shoes. Unless you want to keep them on to remind us of upward mobility, in which case keep them on. Biscuits?\u201d\n\nApril laughed, the kind of laugh that put furniture at ease. She took off her shoes because not to would have been unthinkable in that room. She sat where the light was kind to cheekbones. She accepted a biscuit with a little sigh because sugar is an argument you often let win. \u201cI can\u2019t stay long,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a photo at one with eight cats who found helmets.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do when you\u2019re not being pre,\u201d Nico asked, as if to prove he had not already thought of the way she had placed her hands on the edge of the table as if hands truly belong there.\n\n\u201cLiaison,\u201d she said. \u201cLike my cousin, but with more muffins. I fill out forms. I convince elderly squirrels not to third-party in local elections. I tell very young sidekicks to chew before speaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you like it.\u201d\n\nShe looked at him, surprised. \u201cI like parts. I like the parts where I think I\u2019m pouring a little oil into a hinge and the door swings more kindly for someone. I hate the parts with clipboards.\u201d\n\n\u201cClipboards are a plague,\u201d his grandmother said, drumming her fingers on the table in a rhythm that could convince thunderstorms to reschedule.\n\nThey took the photograph. April positioned him in the shoes with the jacket he had not chosen and a tie he would be caught dead in. His grandmother stood behind the camera with ferocious concentration, her tongue peeking out, because taking a good photograph is half intention, half pretending you like the person more than words.\n\nThe picture was bad in a way that made it human. Nico\u2019s hair refused to salute. April\u2019s collar chose rebellion. The light insisted on making a joke about his left ear. When they were done, April took the tiny card from the machine and slid it into the mouth of a tablet that swallowed images chewless. She grinned. \u201cIt\u2019ll look fine on phones.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to look fine on a phone,\u201d he muttered.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you are not a phone,\u201d his grandmother said, placing a hand on his cheek as if to reassure herself that he was made of exactly what she remembered. \u201cGo. Go to your interview. Take your arguments. Take your shoes. Take my courage. Bring back gossip.\u201d\n\nWhen he left the apartment with the box of biscuits and a heart like a seat he hadn\u2019t sat on yet, he did not know that someone had stuck a sticker on the back bumper of his van that said I BELIEVE IN DRAINS. He did not know that three monkeys in bowling shirts had taken a bet on whether or not his left shoe would squeak under pressure. He did not know that a grandmother in a floral dress had slid into a closet and laughed into her hand, pleased with a joke not yet told, and then gone very still, thinking of something else, a memory he had not asked for yet.\n\nThe World House sits where the river spreads out and becomes almost a lake, a building of white stone and excessive mirrors. It has steps that shall not be climbed while chewing gum. It has doors that open when they like you. The square outside was full of helpful volunteers in matching vests whose matchingness made Nico itch. He recognized the kind of party that was underway. He recognized the distribution of water bottles like absolution. He recognized a man in a suit on a dais saying the word journey twice in one sentence and felt his soul do a small impersonation of sleep.\n\nApril met him by the fountain where somebody had installed two carved fish who never shut up. \u201cYou look like a person who does not want to be here,\u201d she said companionably.\n\n\u201cI look like me,\u201d he said. \u201cIs your job to put people at ease?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cMy job is to know where the muffins are and then to plausibly claim they\u2019ve run out. Come on. They\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\nShe guided him through a side entrance where a woman with a clipboard\u2014curse them\u2014checked his name against a list and frowned, then smiled, then frowned again for variety. They walked down a corridor where portraits of past Keepers hung in frames that might as well have had little signs that said Try. He recognized two. He had hated one. April pushed open a door.\n\nInside: three panelists and a plant that was thriving beyond reason. He took a seat. The panelists asked him questions that ranged from what is your first memory to name a policy that reverses a river without breaking the bank. When he answered the first one with Grandma Nell laughing with her mouth full of sunflower seeds, the orangutan on the right said, \u201cWe prefer images with less chewing.\u201d When he answered the second with a half hour of maniacal specifics about topography, drainage canals, and seeds, the capuchin in the center said, \u201cYou\u2019ve thought about this,\u201d surprised as if the application process did not intend to reward thought.\n\nApril stood in the corner and chewed a pencil. Nico talked. He didn\u2019t charm them. He did not perform charm\u2019s tightrope trick. He described a world he wanted to keep in sentences like someone measuring a pipe with both eyes half-closed. He said \u201cplease\u201d exactly once and \u201cno\u201d exactly three times. He tried not to use the word empathy and failed. He said he wanted a sidekick because there are jobs you cannot do alone and we should all get over the romance of it. He said he wanted to fight crime but mostly he wanted to fight being convinced that crime is only what poor people do.\n\nWhen it was over, the capuchin said, \u201cWe will be in touch.\u201d The orangutan said, \u201cDo you have a weakness for pastries.\u201d Nico said, \u201cYes,\u201d automatically, and then, \u201cNo,\u201d automatically, and the capuchin wrote something down that could have been yes or no or both, because sometimes you can see the word and it means its own shadow.\n\nHe stepped outside into light that had decided to be theatrical. The square was a mild chaos of banners and hopefuls and unicycles because there is always at least one unicycle at a civic event. April came out after him and handed him a small gold token in the shape of the World House, which would get him a discount on sandwiches in the vicinity for exactly three days. He wanted to say something scaldingly honest to cut the sweetness of the token and yet he couldn\u2019t. He looked at her, and she looked at him, and in the look was a kind of mutual exhaustion and a small flame.\n\n\u201cYou did well,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI did something,\u201d he said. The fish in the fountain refused to be quiet about it. He put the token in the pocket with the banana pen and felt suddenly burdensome with symbolism. He was going to say goodbye when the interim Keeper, a slender macaque with dark-ringed eyes, stepped up to a microphone and said the joke word that had created the mess they were all standing in.\n\nThe word was Hope.\n\nIt sprayed over the square like bubbles. It slid off most people. It stuck to a few. There was applause. There were cupcakes. There were hats. There was a moment where a small boy with a half-eaten apple looked up at Nico and asked, with a curiosity so ungoverned it hurt, \u201cAre you going to be the person who tells everyone to calm down?\u201d and Nico said, \u201cNo,\u201d and the boy nodded as if reassured that the right answers still existed.\n\nOn his way back to the van, he almost tripped over a crate left on the curb. It was stamped with a stamp that said FRAGILE: WORDS. He looked for a name, found none, hesitated, did not kick it. You don\u2019t kick boxes full of words. You lift them carefully. You carry them home. You open them one letter at a time.\n\nHe drove across the city with the interview breathing in his ear like a dog. He stopped at a light and watched a troop of macaques cross the street in a line with the confidence of inherited offices. A woman in a cloak of peacock feathers distributed fliers that said BECOME UNGOVERNABLE, TODAY ONLY. The light turned green like a dare. He drove on.\n\nAt home his grandmother had rearranged the kitchen and also reality. She had hung a string of paper lanterns that said Congratulations in five languages only one of which had been invented yet. She had made a soup that smelled like comfort and advertised nothing. She listened to his story with her chin in her hand and her eyes on his face as if his words were things she could gather into her lap and keep from rolling under the radiator.\n\n\u201cAre you going to be Keeper,\u201d she asked when he was done.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d He waited for her to say you do, because she said that sometimes when he sounded like a bench waiting to be sat on.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll choose someone,\u201d she said. \u201cThey always do. They will choose the one who looks least like a scandal. They will choose the one who looks like a story we can believe in for six months. Make sure you are not in their story unless you want to be.\u201d She reached into her apron pocket and pulled out a small object. A whistle. Silver. She put it in his palm. \u201cIn case you need to make a sound that stops a room.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere did you get this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the day your mother was born,\u201d she said, and for the first time that week he saw her look not like a storm, but like its rainbow. \u201cYou were not there. I was. It was loud. And then it wasn\u2019t. You went quiet for too long. And then you yelled. You have always yelled in the precise moments. Keep yelling.\u201d\n\nHe held the whistle because he could not hold her reminders. He put it on a string and wore it under his shirt and it ticked against his heart like the jam machine when it was nervous.\n\nThe call with the decision came at dawn, while pigeons practiced sentences on the sill. The phone rang like a friend. Nico woke from a dream about a blueprint that rearranged itself whenever he blinked. He answered. Lara\u2019s voice. Not April. Lara, the oil-smudged simultaneous apology.\n\n\u201cYou got it,\u201d she said. No preamble. \u201cInterim Keeper for six months. Congratulations, Mr. Fawcett. Pack a toothbrush. We start with an oath. Then lunch. Then seven meetings. Then the part where nothing happens and all of it matters. Bring your\u2026 you.\u201d\n\nHe sat up. He sat all the way up. The room came into focus like a picture agreeing to be seen. His grandmother appeared in the doorway with two cups of tea and the sound of his life arranged into tiny, edible decisions. \u201cWell,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. He cried because it was a day to do both. He leaned his head against the wall and felt the paint cool and paintlike under his hair. He thought: a plumber. A city that smells like bananas and ambition. A world that needs keeping like a pipe needs a hand. A rule that says if you want to fight crime, you need a sidekick. A rule that says if you want a sidekick, be a world leader. Fine, then. Fine.\n\nHis grandmother pried open a jar of marmalade. \u201cI will make a hat out of this. And then I will throw it at TV.\u201d\n\nHe dressed. He put on the shoes. He placed the whistle on the string, cool against his chest. He took the banana pen, for luck. He stuck the gold token into his pocket because he wouldn\u2019t be eating lunch if all of this was a prank. He paused in the doorway, turned, saw his grandmother watching him with the expression you sometimes find on saints who are actually very good at practical jokes.\n\n\u201cAnything you\u2019re not telling me,\u201d he asked, for no reason he could name. It came out as a joke. It came out as a question thrown at a wall, expecting to bounce.\n\nShe smiled a smile with ten eras inside it. \u201cOnly that you should eat. And if anyone offers you a smoothie with fiber, throw it over your shoulder.\u201d She patted the machine with the levers. It ticked. It ticked some more. It whirred once, like a bird clearing its throat. \u201cGo on,\u201d she said. \u201cTell the board with the tails that water runs downhill without their approval.\u201d\n\nHe left. The city looked like a person about to laugh at a funeral. The river shined. The monkeys hung from their streetlight perches and traded stock tips. The first of seven meetings waited.\n\nAnd somewhere, high above everything he knew and beneath everything he didn\u2019t, were strings that would, one day, reveal themselves for what they were. Not divine, not cruel, just thin and human and tied in knots with careful, mischievous hands.",

                              "content": "Chapter 3\n\nThe oath room of the World House was shaped to make promises sound taller than they were. It cupped the sound and poured it back, sugared, so that even muttered clauses acquired a flourish. Chandeliers like the dreams of spiders hung from the ceiling in a geometry that dared you to count. On the dais, a ceremonial lectern squinted at the crowd as if wary of stains, and a carpet the color of patient authority ushered dignitaries toward a rug-cleared center where yesterday\u2019s vows had left a faint heat. A table along the back wall offered refreshments that had opinions\u2014shot glasses of green juice whispering about fiber, delicate stacks of breadless sandwiches held together by ambition, platters of banana slices so artfully fanned they might have been warned not to exhibit subversive circles.\n\nLara met him at the door with a badge that said KEEPER\u2014INTERIM, which she clipped to his lapel as if fastening a kite to a boy. She wore the same sheen of composure she had before, and the same smudge of oil high on her cheekbone like a punctuation, and Nico wanted to wipe it off and then wanted not to, because a sentence that ends in a real dot has more authority than one that ends in a glossy smudge. She steered him past a glass case of ceremonial policy pens, past a display of retired oaths bound in narrow blue books, past a mural that depicted the first Keeper comforting a river with a blanket. It occurred to him that institutions loved their past the way a cookbook loves its photographs.\n\n\u201cYou will repeat after the Moderator,\u201d Lara said, keeping her voice low enough not to be recruited into the anthem. \u201cYou will hold this copy of the Charter, which is heavier than it needs to be. You will say the part about keeping the world and also the part about not weaponizing muffins. There is a clause about sidekicks. Listen careful. They changed the punctuation last winter and one comma now makes you responsible for the verbs of your partner.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does one keep a verb,\u201d he asked, because the room\u2019s earnestness had a way of making sarcasm put on a tie.\n\n\u201cYou will,\u201d she said, entirely sincere and entirely amused, \u201cput it in your pocket, obviously.\u201d\n\nThe anthem rose like steam from a polite kettle. It had the sort of lyrics that looked good printed on tote bags and lost all sense when you read them straight. The Moderator, an owl-faced human in a suit that had outlived two administrations and a divorce, raised a hand. Nico stepped into the clearing. A lens zoomed with the sound of a small, hungry animal. In the second row a porpoise in a wheelchair adjusted her scarf and made the sign of the fish with a fin, which Nico had learned meant both \u201cgood luck\u201d and \u201cdo not be boring.\u201d He took the Charter. He felt the weight settle on his palms and also on his spine and also on a part of his chest that had, for years, only noticed sudden cold.\n\n\u201cRepeat after me,\u201d the Moderator said, and he did, because you can disrespect many things about a ceremony but you should not disrespect a whole room\u2019s desire to hear a certain music. He repeated the clause about tending to the world as if it were a garden infested with opinions. He repeated the clause about sidekicks, which, comma relocated, now made it clear that in the event of an official pairing, the Keeper would neither claim the deeds of the sidekick nor abandon them when the publicity soured. He repeated the clause about keeping his hands off the levers when the levers belonged to other theaters. He said \u201cso keep me\u201d at the end as tradition demanded, and for a second it felt like the room obliged, friendly as water.\n\nThe applause tasted like biscuits because at the back of the room Granny Nell had managed to infiltrate in a dress with so many flowers it could feign municipal capacity. She stood beside a man holding a tray and fed the man one of her lemon thimbles every time he made a face that suggested he was about to move her along. She had put on lipstick in a color called municipal plum and it gave her the energy of a new ordinance. When Nico caught her eye she did not wave because she hated theatrical sentiment, but she lifted her chin the way you lift a beaten rug and everything in him dusted.\n\nThey gave him a key in a velvet pouch that did not fit any actual lock. It unlocked a state of mind. They gave him a schedule on thick paper with a waterline embossed as if to warn that all of this would sink if mishandled. They gave him a smile that said if you choose to step off the dais now, no one will ask why, and he stayed on the dais and shook six hands that had the softness of people who file complaints about handshakes. The interim Keeper who was leaving stood at his side like a person handing off a precious vase that had already rolled down stairs. The macaque\u2019s eyes were very bright with lack of sleep and something like relief.\n\n\u201cYou will love the plant,\u201d the macaque said under the applause, and gestured toward a glossy monster of leaves in a pot to the left of the dais. \u201cIt listens. It likes show tunes. Do not feed it sugar. Feed it gossip. It thrives on gossip.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can do that,\u201d Nico said, which was true on several levels, and the macaque squeezed his shoulder so hard he heard tendons compute.\n\nThey moved him, as per schedule, straight into a room that did not admit daylight and painted it on instead. The Sidekick Bureau had taken over a suite where a think tank had previously tried to make fire sit up and take notes. Lara held the door because clipboards had learned to multiply in that corridor and one must be kind to the unarmed. Inside, a gleaming screen the size of social expectations presented row upon row of faces with blue bars underneath that claimed to represent compatibility, and little locks that claimed to represent legalities, and icons shaped like muffins to warn of severe allergies to being managed. A coffee ring had indeed stained the corner where a little corner should never have been left unguarded. An assistant with eyebrows that had been trained for diplomacy touched the corner with a napkin that apologized for its lateness.\n\n\u201cWe keep it simple,\u201d the Bureau director said with the confidence of someone arguing that gravity is intuitive. \u201cYou describe your operational needs. We cross-reference with current availability, ethics flags, conflict maps, and the Unlocated. You get three interviews. You choose one, or we flip a coin in a way that looks procedural. The Important Crime-Fighting Act insists your sidekick be assigned by your office, approved by ours, and blessed by a clergy of your choice if you have one. Do you have a clergy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have an appliance that makes eggs when nervous,\u201d Nico said, and the director\u2019s pen paused mid-scratch because she did not have a field for that. \u201cOperational needs: someone who isn\u2019t impressed by uniforms. Someone who dislikes lantern parades. Someone who will eat the last biscuit without apologizing because we are not, in fact, in a story about sharing.\u201d\n\nThe faces rearranged when he said the word uniforms as if obedience had subroutines. April\u2019s face appeared briefly in a corner with a tag that said PRE\u2014COMMITTED, which he did not look at because his usefulness for longing had expired in another decade. Lara tapped at the screen without jabbing it, as if you might coax a better answer if you acted tender. Two faces floated to the top with the authority of bubbles that believed in themselves.\n\n\u201cKestrel Finch,\u201d the director said, indicating a human woman whose eyes assessed, instead of glowed. Her file had the neat scars of public service. \u201cEx-sidekick to three mid-level heroes with average mortality rates, a gift for logistics, one suspension for refusing to wear a cape during a wind advisory, one commendation for talking down a crowd when donuts ran out. Brilliant with radios. Possibly allergic to bananas. Also, Ruumal-42, a macaque trained in counter-propaganda work, nonviolent interventions, and climbing out of windows with a typewriter, but we are currently short of primate sidekicks for optics.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not,\u201d Nico said, and felt the plant in the corner lean in, \u201crun with a monkey. That would become the point. If the point becomes the point, nothing else gets to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cFinch, then,\u201d Lara said, and smiled because the spreadsheet itself seemed to relax. \u201cShe\u2019s top shelf. The shelf is imaginary but very confident. She\u2019s between primary assignments. She likes early mornings. You\u2019ll want early mornings. You will not get early mornings, but wanting is a ritual.\u201d\n\nThey brought Kestrel in as if she were a weather change. She wore a jacket that had been altered to fit shoulders that didn\u2019t ask permission. Her hair was braided to keep it from narrating. She had a scar at her jaw that said luck had been paying attention exactly once. She took in the room with a turn of the head that made it clear a good head turn is both a map and a warning.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the plumber,\u201d she said, which was not accusation and not adoration and not the surprised contempt that often arrived baked under those words. It was a labeling, clean as writing NAILS on a jar and discovering, in fact, nails.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the person who refused a cape in high wind,\u201d he said, and Kestrel\u2019s mouth lifted a millimeter because mutual oral histories are often made of refusals. She did not put out a hand. He did not either. They regarded each other like neighboring houses that knew they were about to share a fence.\n\n\u201cThere is a clause,\u201d the director intoned, finding comfort in ritual while paper found comfort in letting itself be abused. \u201cYou two will co-sign. You will never commit to solo operations. You will attend twelve hours of interplay training, online if you prefer to loathe it in private, and you will check in with me on Thursdays to make me feel necessary. Do you consent to be paired under the Charter for Interim Duration, revocable at the point of jam.\u201d\n\n\u201cJam,\u201d Nico said, stunned by the coincidence until he realized the director had said the acronym for Joint Assignment Mandate. He signed. Kestrel signed. Their names looked like they liked standing next to each other. The plant rustled, delighted.\n\nThey went to lunch because the schedule insisted that if food was eaten in rooms with windows, calories achieved the moral high ground. Lunch was a donor affair that smelled like perfumes that had never eaten an onion. The plaza outside the World House had sprouted tiny tents that sold interpretations of sustenance. Chortle waited for them at the nearest tent with a plate of beet carpaccio arranged in the shape of \u201cYes,\u201d and an expression he might have practiced in a mirror with live audience.\n\n\u201cWorldStart,\u201d he said, as if they had all been whispering the name behind their hands. \u201cMy dear Keeper and newly minted adjunct, have you heard about our bespoke care for your bespoke burden. We design your glide path. We attach you to a brand that reassures the citizens and perturbs your enemies into khakis. We offer a package called Downstream\u2014ha-ha\u2014which focuses on your ability to keep the noisier parts of governance from splashing on shoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI own two pairs of shoes,\u201d Nico said, and the truth of it did a small victory dance. \u201cYou sound like a person who would install a drain in a rectangle. It will hold for three months and then the corners will burn. No, thank you. My enemies can wear what they like.\u201d\n\nChortle laughed because good manners had saved his life once and he treated them as a second spine. He checked Kestrel with a glance and found her politely uninterested in being assessed. He waved, instead, at a rolling whiteboard where a flow chart had been written in friendly arrows. The chart suggested that by pairing with WorldStart, world leaders became photogenic waterfalls that citizens could drink from without choking. Kestrel used a beet slice as a coaster and Chortle pretended not to mind because pretending is ninety percent of diplomacy.\n\nSeven meetings commenced in the afternoon like seven amusements promised by a fair that had forgotten the rides and gotten enthusiastic about paperwork. In the first, a budget person presented numbers in beige. They had organized the world into columns that behaved. They told him how sidekicks were financed and what percentage of each cape was tax-deductible, which caused Kestrel\u2019s eyebrow to quiver in a manner that indicated a deep belief in a universe where an eyebrow might stop a clap. In the second, the Cape Compliance Office reminded him that wind maps were now considered classified because a rogue breakdancer had used them to plan a performance. He asked which part of the map told you where a cape would end up if the cape had opinions, and the Compliance officer stared at him as if he had asked about the presence of God in a spreadsheet.\n\nIn the third, a woman with hair like winter bones asked him to approve a pigeon relocation initiative. The pigeons had built private property atop municipal statues and were charging rent in the form of bread. Relocating them required a sermon about collective housing. He suggested building statues pigeons would find dull and the woman\u2019s eyes lit as if she had been waiting to be allowed to believe in boring monuments. In the fourth, an investigator briefed him on laughter distribution at investor breakfasts. Nobody ever expects laughter to be trafficked until you find invoices for guffaws and realize human joy makes a reliable commodity. \u201cWe are tracing it at the level of invoice numbering,\u201d the investigator said, trying to make spreadsheets sound like a swordfight, and Nico wondered if the real economy was always the black-market exchange of actual warmth.\n\nThe fifth meeting convened the Sidekick Code Council in a circle that strove for campfire and achieved chair store. A boy of seventeen with energy he could not disguise argued that the Code\u2019s bar on solo actions made sidekicks tools. An older woman with a voice like cared-for leather said the rule had saved her life twice, and she wanted to keep it around like a superstition that had earned its keep. Kestrel spoke only once to say that the Code should be rewritten by the least photogenic, and the council wrote that down with the fever of people noting an answer they would not ever put into practice. In the sixth, river rights knocked and he let her in. The river\u2019s human interpreter wore boots that smelled like silt and said the water wanted its own seat at the table. He asked the water how it felt about chairs. The interpreter cocked her head, listened, and said the river asked whether the chairs had backs that bent.\n\nThe seventh was a meeting with Infrastructure about Category Three designations, and he made himself behave. He contained his voice the way you can contain steam for an elegant minute before the whistle insists on happening. He described, for people who had not asked, how a sauna\u2019s drain coordinates with the arrogance of pastry trays. He showed them on paper how a Category Three could sometimes be a Category Two if you bribed gravity with a little more slope. He managed to say \u201cpeel management\u201d without laughing, which earned him a nod from a man who wore a ring with a wrench engraved on it and had the aura of someone\u2019s heroic grandfather.\n\nAn emergency introduced itself mid-afternoon with a march of interns. The blond one spoke because life had trained him to, and announced that the World House basement was gently floating. A pipe that serviced the southeast wing had made an unwise decision to become interesting. Water was pooling between archives and strategy. Meetings had a way of arrhythmia when liquid took a vote. The bouquet of brittle documents in a glass box began to sag in the room next door as the humidity climbed toward anecdote.\n\nHe and Kestrel took the stairs two at a time, leaving behind a sentence about river chairs that he would later regret abandoning mid-metaphor. The basement breathed a damp that had character. The smell of old cardboard sulked in the corners. The pipe that had capitulated was not old enough to be proud and not new enough to be stubborn. He put his hand on it the way you put your hand on a horse\u2019s neck and told it he had questions. Kestrel elbowed a storage locker that had developed opinions and dug out towels older than most charters. They worked without speaking because some partnerships begin with silence and a leak.\n\nThe rupture was at a seam a contractor had once pronounced \u201cgood enough,\u201d perhaps with a shrug that paid for a vacation. Nico tightened and tasted metal in the back of his throat. He asked Kestrel to hold one end at an angle that no three hands could find, and she did because she had a talent for becoming extra hands in a crisis. The water obeyed physics at last and stopped doing improv. Papers sighed back onto their shelves. Somewhere upstairs the donors discovered that the mini quiches had cooled.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t have called a plumber,\u201d Kestrel said, panting, happy.\n\n\u201cI tried,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was busy becoming Interim Keeper.\u201d\n\nThey stood there in muck with their sleeves soaked up to ambition and he remembered, very suddenly, the jam machine on his table at home and how it had whirred for acknowledgment the day before. He told himself the thought had no bearing. He told himself a household appliance cannot influence municipal plumbing from across town, even if it loves him. The thought sat in his pocket and did not agree to go away.\n\nBy the time dawn slid off the windows the next morning, he had learned three new hallways and the names of two people who would save him if he found himself trapped beneath a collapsible table. He had also learned that hope makes the coffee taste better if you leave it alone and drink it cold. He read dossiers while eating an apple because apples haunt the pockets of men who pretend they have gotten enough sleep. The first dossier was about helmets. Not cats, though the cats with helmets had enjoyed their day. This one described a pattern of armored assaults on small, unimportant vendors who sold wire, bolts, and other objects easy to tuck into a jacket lining. The helmeted persons were tidy and unfriendly and paid in coins that no longer circulated.\n\n\u201cCopper ring,\u201d he said, aloud, because sometimes naming a thing is a passcode. The copper theft under the old tram line had quieted after his unfortunate layoff, only to become a rumor in another part of town. He traced the addresses and drew a shape. The shape did not resemble anything holy. It resembled a plan designed by people who loved geometry and not faces.\n\nKestrel put a cup of something caffeinated down by his elbow as if bribing a map. \u201cThey\u2019re meeting in the depot,\u201d she said, and tapped a spot on his estimate with a nail that had no time for polish. \u201cWe have four hours before they unspool the night\u2019s take and turn it into a rumor. We can request a squad. We can request a press shadow. We can request a permit to stand where there used to be fire extinguishers and wait.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can request a map no one has drawn on yet,\u201d he said, because all of his maps arrive pre-loved and it made him itchy. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to be the law, even with the word Keeper taped to my suit. But we can be the person who reminds the building where its throat is.\u201d\n\nThey went without a press shadow because he liked to meet his humiliation alone. The depot crouched by the old tram line like a cat with a plan. Its tin roof had learned the drum. Pigeons considered the rafters and found them insufficiently philosophical. Graffiti bloomed along one wall in a hand he recognized as a person he had once promised to employ and then hadn\u2019t, because money behaves. They arrived with exactly one permit to do nothing, a whisper from the Bureau that the police were busy being televised somewhere corporate, and a bag of tools, because even a man with a badge uncapitalized trusts a wrench.\n\nInside the depot the air tasted of old oil and the present tense. Voices reached them in a braid. There was the hiss of wire unfurling. There was a laugh that never learned to be kind. There was also, below it, like a river under a river, the subtle syllable of a pipe too full of itself. Nico crouched and pressed his ear to a rusty panel in the wall. He could hear the depot\u2019s plumbing argue in short vowels. He could also, faintly, hear the monkey board, not of Peel & Prosper, but of a contractor\u2019s guild that had recently begun to practice governance in the shadows. Their low voices carried where schedules could not.\n\n\u201cWe pass,\u201d grunted someone whose consonants paraded in a troop. \u201cWe take this. We leave that. The Keeper is a faucet. Turn him. He\u2019ll give.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Nico said, not to the pipe, but to Kestrel, because promising to a partner counts double. He felt her nod through the floor. He felt it in his kneecap and then in his mouth, which wanted to become a whistle. He put his hand flat on the wall and pushed. The metal reluctantly consented to a gap and the gap began to talk. Through it he could see the wire stacked like sin. He could see helmets glinting in a light those helmets invented for confidence. He could also see, directly opposite, where someone had installed a false drain to carry away evidence. It ran nowhere useful. It ran to a pity pit.\n\nHe did not do lone heroics. He had promised the comma and Kestrel. They used their minutes like rope. Kestrel slid back to a vantage point that would allow a photo proving conspiracy in a court that still liked paper. Nico dialed a municipal number and got a recording telling him to leave a message after the tone. He left a message that was largely a set of measurements. He took a picture of the false drain as if it were a friend he had caught lying. When one of the helmet people turned toward the false drain and cursed it for having a moral backbone, he understood suddenly that someone ahead of him had tried to fix this, and failed, and the failure had left a shape in the room everyone was stepping around.\n\nA helmeted man with a stare you could use to open cans looked up and saw the gap in the wall and recognized, as criminals do, a mischief he had not planned. He shouted. Other helmets turned. Kestrel released from her place and returned to his side with the fastness of sound. They bolted. Running became the only punctuation. Boots slapped time. The depot yelled an echo. He counted shadows and found two extra. One belonged to an obligation. The other belonged to a rumor. He did not look back because looking back has never, in any tragedy, made someone trip less.\n\nThey made it out and into the tram bed\u2019s rib cage. Rust made lace where trains had reduced to stories. Kestrel tugged him under the carcass of a platform where the smell of cool iron offered a neutral opinion. The helmets split like traffic encountering a boulder. They flanked without grace. Nico grabbed for the whistle under his shirt as if for a sentence you didn\u2019t have time to finish and breathed into it with the full weight of someone\u2019s first breath. The sound that came was not loud. It was huge. It filled the rails. It slid along residual electricity. It went into the dirt and asked the worms to please participate. It startled the helmets because they had not planned for very old notes.\n\nThe sound also did another thing. It woke the nest of sleepers in the tunnel two bends down. The sleepers, who were people who had been told the law was a stranger and made of clocks, started awake and swore in the language of towels. They rose as a committee, all wronged, armed with broom handles and a fence. Helmets bounced off a human tide of common sense. Kestrel slid to her feet and suggested convincingly that everyone move in a direction not indicated by any arrow. He reached the van he had left under an argument with a parking sign and they dove in as the sleepers filled the depot\u2019s mouth with a new policy.\n\n\u201cNever do that without warning me,\u201d Kestrel said as he drove, and he laughed so hard he nearly hit a sign that insisted you would be judged by angels if you turned left.\n\n\u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI carry emergency sound.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else do you carry,\u201d she asked, as none of the cigarettes in the glove compartment were actually cigarettes and none of the maps led to the ocean. She had one hand braced on the dash in a way that did not invite romance and did invite sanity. He told her about the banana pen. He told her about the token with a sandwich discount he had not yet exploited. He told her about a jar of marmalade that had once saved him from telling the truth at the wrong moment. She nodded. She patted her jacket and revealed a coil of line, two signal mirrors, a packet of raisins that had survived three administrations, and a cutting of a plant that might have ideas.\n\nThey returned to the World House, which had opinions about dirt. Lara intercepted them with a studied lack of alarm and a pair of damp cloths she must have stolen from a benevolent cafeteria. Her eyes flicked from Kestrel to Nico to the smear of tunnel on their pant legs and she decided, after a brief conference with herself, not to ask about anything yet. He loved her, in that instant, with the respect plumbers reserve for the wrench that turns without stripping.\n\n\u201cPress,\u201d she said, as if identifying weather. \u201cYou can say nothing, something, or a proposal. Nothing will be taken as guilt. Something will be taken as ignorance. A proposal will be taken as weakness unless it includes the word \u2018pilot.\u2019 We have five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a proposal,\u201d he said, wiping tunnel from his hands. \u201cSidekick Bureau pilot pairing for unglamorous crimes. Copper. Bread theft. Money laundering that uses laundry. Pair a hero with a sidekick and a plumber or other person capable of telling the truth about objects. Half pay. Double glory. Do not photograph. Results delivered on a postcard. Pilot name: Screw Coupling.\u201d\n\n\u201cScrew Coupling,\u201d Lara repeated, delighted, and wrote it down with the seriousness of ink on the Declaration of anything. \u201cI can sell that. I can sell the parts you didn\u2019t mean to be funny. The rest comes with a hat.\u201d\n\nThey walked into the press room, which was not a room but a pit with lights and smiles, and the questions distributed themselves like confetti motivated by hunger. He answered as if each camera lens were a pipe that could be persuaded if you pushed with gentleness. He said he was not a river but he had spoken to pipes and they had opinions. He said he had no desire to fight a brand war while water ran the wrong way. He introduced the pilot like a person introduces a baby at the door and then refuses to let anyone hold it. Kestrel stood half a step behind him like a sentence you complete later. When they were done and the lights let them go, he felt the exhaustion that comes when everything you said was almost true.\n\nHe made it home that night with a head that buzzed like a lamp about to go. The kitchen smelled of a recipe that had bullied joy into submission and then apologized. Granny Nell had filled the sink with soapy water that looked like a rally. She wore an apron with the legend THIS APRON HAS SEEN THINGS and a pin in the shape of a wasp that moved on its own because sometimes she made jewelry with motives. She noted the tunnel on his trousers and nodded, not at the dirt but at the part of him that had refused to become the point.\n\n\u201cHow was keeping,\u201d she asked, sifting powdered sugar over the belief that it made desserts professional.\n\n\u201cIt involves meetings,\u201d he said, and she smiled a smile that said it would. He told her about Kestrel, and Helmets, and how absurd it feels to get a discount on sandwiches because you said yes. He told her about the whistle and the sleepers and how falling apart in a controlled fashion appears to be governance. She fed him a piece of cake that had mistaken itself for a hat and made a fuss when it crumbled, not in scolding but in admiration for a good collapse.\n\nThe jam machine on the table ticked in that way that meant it wanted an audience. It had acquired a sticker in his absence that said PROPERTY OF NO ONE, which told him his grandmother had been to a thing. He touched the lever and the machine hummed like a throat preparing to speak. He lifted an eyebrow at Granny Nell and she kept sprinkling sugar until the kitchen became a weather event.\n\n\u201cAnything I should know,\u201d he asked, trying to keep casual in a room where nothing had ever successfully been casual.\n\n\u201cThere will be bees on Thursday,\u201d she said, as if announcing a guest list. \u201cI went to the World House to deliver biscuits directly to the plant, which is, may I say, extremely well. I passed a committee of men who want to redefine the word riot to mean things they don\u2019t attend, and a woman who knows exactly where the laughter invoices are printed. I kept my tongue like a secret. I ran into Mr. Chi\u2019s cousin who is collecting signatures for his electrician to be on the side of history. I told him all sides of history are history and he patted my arm as if I were adorable, and then I told him about a transformer under the 17th Street bridge that hums the names of cities we haven\u2019t built yet.\u201d\n\nHe waited, and she did not add what she needed to add. She did not tell him the thing he felt moving under her sentences like a fish under ice. She wiped the counter. She adjusted the oven dial to a number that didn\u2019t exist. She straightened a photograph of his parents without looking at it. She took a breath that held seven stories and let it out steady.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not telling me something,\u201d he said, not in accusation but in the tone of a person checking a door before bed. She cocked her head at him and admired his face like a recipe that had come out yelling.\n\n\u201cI am not telling you many things,\u201d she said, making no apology because apologies are cakes you distribute too freely at your peril. \u201cIf you require one, I will deliver it with a ribbon. If you require two, I will write them on a pear. If you require three, I will go to the river and ask for a seat that bends. But tonight you require sleep. You will not get it. You will pretend.\u201d\n\nHe did pretend, and he slept like someone piloted by a competent clown through fields of small disasters. He woke at no hour, dressed in his two-pair shoes, and went to greet a day that had scheduled for itself both triumph and a banana peel. Kestrel waited on the stoop with a backpack folded into the impossible geometry of professionals. April waved from the curb as if to reassure herself that she could be happy for other people in a uniform. Lara texted a message that said the copper ring had scattered and the sleepers had formed a committee.\n\nThey spent the morning installing the pilot, which did not install itself so much as sit down where told and look around for reasons not to. He met a crew of electricians who had saved the city a hundred times without ever being given a hat. He signed a memorandum that read like a love letter written by someone who had been hurt and still believed in the post. He argued with a person whose job it was to make the word liability smaller. He read a note scrawled by a child and pressed at him by a mother outside the World House gates that said my dad says if you fix the drains the rats will come up and I say then we can meet them and ask them to leave. He put the note in his pocket with the token and banana pen and felt the accumulation make new weight.\n\nNear noon, a courier arrived with a box so narrow it implied secrets. The label bore the bureaucracy\u2019s calm handwriting and the slightly showy stamp of the Office. Inside lay a thin brass rod with a hook at the end, and a square folded cloth. The note explained that the rod fit into a latch above the dais in the oath room; if he chose, he could lower a shade no one had lowered in twenty years and make the room less theatrical and more accurate. The cloth, the note said, was the original oath cloth for the plant. It was to be tied around its pot when he wanted it to feel part of something. He went to the oath room during a gap that did not exist and held the rod like a key. He reached up, hooked the latch, and pulled.\n\nThe shade came down. The light gentled. The chairs looked like chairs and not like the idea of chairs. The portraits became humans and monkeys and not the reasons he would be yelled at. He tied the cloth around the plant and the plant shivered as if receiving gossip from the hands of a grandmother.\n\nNews traveled through Brasshaven as if the city itself had a bloodstream for rumor. By evening he was already being described as the Keeper who didn\u2019t clap on beat and asked chairs to be chairs. The monkeys in suits took meetings in which somebody used the word authenticity and somebody else used the word threat. A capuchin with pearls scheduled a breakfast for Necessary Rich People and determined to ask him whether he believed in Trickle-Down Bananas, and whether was the answer he wanted or wanted to be seen wanting. The river issued a sigh that raised the hair on the arms of those who listened. The sky tried on three blues before dinner.\n\nDinner arrived as a knock on his door. Granny Nell opened it without asking his permission because permission is for things that might be refused. A woman in a coat that had decided long ago it would not change stood on the threshold holding a cake that was also a hat. Her hair might have been rain once. She wore no makeup and an expression like a win. He knew her from a photograph he did not own.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d she said, eyes on Nico\u2019s face the way you look at an envelope you are about to open with your teeth. \u201cI am here because your grandmother told me to stop imagining the word later. I am also here to tell you that keeping is a job I invented with other names and I do not want to be thanked. I brought a cake that must be worn before it is eaten, and news that has no shape yet, and a letter addressed to you by someone who believes in drains.\u201d\n\nGranny Nell stood behind her with those ten eras again in her smile and raised an eyebrow that had, once, convinced policemen to apologize to their own hats. She held the jam machine\u2019s cord in her hand like a leash on an animal that was going to behave in the way animals do when they love you and you have betrayed them by leaving for the day. Nico felt the floor tilt and then steady, and then he felt his fingers close around the whistle under his shirt as if his heart had rehearsed.\n\n\u201cCome in,\u201d he said, and the words did what doors always hope words will do. They let a story in and made it sit down, and poured it tea, and told it that it was welcome to make a mess if the mess was honest.",

The cake that had also been a hat leaned on the counter wearing the marks of removed candles like chalk from a solved proof. The letter sat under his tea mug as if that could keep it from proposing anything. His grandmother was already up, having negotiated with the kettle and whatever birds thought they ran the block, and the apartment had that poised-to-tell-a-joke stillness that meant either something had been decided or something had been admitted.\n\nHe had not slept for very long, but what he\u2019d managed had been the exact weight of a coin. In the dream that came and went, he was a boy again on the bathroom floor, watching water find the drain without anybody telling it \u201cnow,\u201d and his mother had been there in the doorway asking him if it bothered him that gravity was so sure of itself. He had thought he\u2019d invented her voice to have a place to put the letter, but the coat still hung on the chair and a bobby pin glittered on the table\u2019s edge like proof of intent. When he picked up the letter, the paper felt older than the ink and the ink felt like it had traveled far with a mouth full of news.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t open your mail because that is a moral boundary I refuse to cross,\u201d his grandmother said, which was true if you extended the definition of \u201cmoral\u201d to include \u201cannoying.\u201d \u201cI did, however, smell it to judge character. It smells like a garage that got religion.\u201d\n\nHe slid his thumb under the flap and loosened the adhesive with a care that felt ceremonial because everything that morning wanted to be a ceremony. The handwriting inside had the confident slant of a person whose sentences expected to be used. There were no greetings as such, and he found that refreshing. Whoever wrote it believed salutations belonged to parades and invitations to court dates. The first line took a deep breath on his behalf and got on with it.\n\nMr. Fawcett,\n\nIf you are reading this, the excuse of later has finally failed to do its job. Good. My name will not help you for the same reason names written on the bottoms of boats do not make them float, but write it down anyway so it will irritate the right file someday: Brindle Clarke, City Drainwright Emeritus, dissolved under unceremonious circumstances after pointing out to people who clip policy pins to their lapels that they had moved a comma in public and a bracket in private. A long time ago, before the Important Crime-Fighting Act became the leash it now pretends not to be, the city built a machine under the city that does not belong to any one administration. It was designed to carry directives the way pipes carry water. It has gates. It has vents. It has a simple instruction that is not anymore.\n\nHe breathed once and let the words flow because they had momentum. Brindle wrote with the frustration of a man who had learned the uses of a wrench late and the dangers of polite language early. The Act\u2019s clause about sidekicks and leaders had always had a comma that made sense to anyone who had ever had to carry a couch up a stairwell: a pause, a sharing, a breath in which two people agreed not to break each other. Last winter, when the punctuation was changed to move the weight, a corresponding change happened in the infrastructure below the World House. A bracket that had held two valves in equal tension shifted; one now bore more load than it should. As above, etcetera. The city, at its most literal, had changed who held verbs.\n\nBrindle did not claim magic outright because he did not have to. He described a conduit under the ceremonial chamber where oaths echoed, a rib of bronze that transmitted more than sound. He described a gear house nicknamed The Throat, where requests and their small cousins went to be sorted from screams. He marked three locations on a crude map hand-drawn on the back of a page he had stolen from a consultant\u2019s slide deck and blessed by spilling coffee on. Under Vulcan Depot. Behind the west abutment of the Seventeenth Street bridge. Beneath the plant in the World House itself. He wrote that moving the bracket back would not fix every sentence in the city, but it would put back the pause that made partnerships a partnership and not a costume. He wrote that he believed in drains because drains had never lied to him, and by the way, if Nico was looking for a word to trust, he could do worse than \u201cunder.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re frowning like a person who just realized a comma has teeth,\u201d Nell observed, sliding a plate of eggs across the table, and he loved her for making breakfast sit next to crisis as if they were cousins at a wedding. \u201cDoes it tell you where to go implement a minor correction in the central nervous system while wearing those shoes they gave you, or does it instruct you to calmly quit and raise goats on a hillside with no civic architecture.\u201d\n\n\u201cOption one with a flattering angle,\u201d he said, reading the paragraph twice because promises hide in corners. \u201cIt\u2019s a map and a grievance. It\u2019s also a warning about bees.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh good,\u201d she said, pleased in a way that made his scalp tighten because his grandmother was only pleased about trouble when she thought the trouble might be worth its outfit. \u201cI was afraid I would have to organize the bees without supervision.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did she tell you after I went to brush my teeth,\u201d he asked, using the pronoun his mouth had chosen in the night and trusting his grandmother not to make a joke of it. \u201cBefore she left with the cake tin and the habit of not saying her name until someone earned it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe told me she had done a cowardly, brave thing and was not yet sure in which order,\u201d Nell said, not hurrying the sentences because she trusted them to arrive. \u201cShe told me she had been following a noise all her life that sounded like a city being told to go to bed when the city was not yet sleepy. She apologized for the weather twenty years ago, which I decline to forgive because if I start I will not stop. She told me she used to be very good at stealing groceries and giving them back later as casseroles. She left you that letter because you like instructions. She asked me not to tidy up behind you too much because you will need to trip once this week to learn. I told her I reserve the right to catch cookware before it shatters.\u201d\n\nHe had known for most of his adult life that there were stories in his house that did not swing open just because he knocked. It was not, until this week, unkind. It was precaution. People keep the lids on boiling things for a reason. He folded the letter and placed it in his pocket with the token and the pen and the note from the child for whom rats were a conversation. He wiped his plate with bread because the eggs had been essentially a thesis. He glanced at the jam machine and the jam machine ticked in a key that made him suspect it understood the phrase \u201cThe Throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to go to the Sidekick Code Council and then pretend not to want to break a piece of furniture with my forehead at a budget review,\u201d he said, standing into his shoes because the shoes did not sit still when you looked at them. \u201cAfter that I have one free hour during which either we save the geography of a bracket or we eat soup in a closet and speak without any nouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cBring me back a noun,\u201d she said, tying her hair into a bun so ferocious it could have fought it out with the municipal plum lipstick. \u201cThe good ones have been rehearsed for other shows and keep missing their cues. Also, on your way home, stop by Mr. Chi\u2019s and ask for the tea he sells to people who have to stand up in front of committees and ask for mercy without blushing. He will tell you there is no such tea. Ask again. He will give you dried leaves he claims are a small mistake.\u201d\n\nThe World House had dreamed in fluorescent while he slept, and the day\u2019s agenda had already acquired two new items just to test how far he could bend without learning what snapped felt like. Kestrel walked in step with him along the corridor where portraits looked resigned, a stack of folders tilted against her hip the way you lean a shield when you\u2019re trying not to look like you\u2019re carrying one. She took the letter when he offered it because trust was a decision they were going to have to make weekly, then daily, then twice before lunch.\n\n\u201cBrindle Clarke,\u201d she said, somewhere between impressed and irritated. \u201cHe shows up at the ends of memos like a ghost who refuses to act like a metaphor. I\u2019ve never seen anyone fire a person for punctuation with such confidence. The Throat is a rumor with good posture.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could start by seeing the rumor,\u201d he said, keeping his voice level because the moment you sounded like someone who believed in backstage machines people decided they had to choose between you and shoes. \u201cBut first we have to let the Council shout about commas in a socially acceptable circle.\u201d\n\nThe Council had upgraded to folding chairs with dignity and a snack table that had learned humility after last week\u2019s donut mutiny. The young ones arrived first with energy and suggestions packaged as petitions. The veterans came in pairs, already arguing on the decibel of two friends who used to be enemies and now practiced the art of never quite healing as a way to keep each other alive. The rulebook sat in the center like a priest you\u2019re fond of but refuse to obey.\n\nHe laid out a case for rewriting the clause not because changing the words would change the world, but because changing the words might change the world\u2019s excuse. He did not say the word spell because the room would have spat him out the window like a seed. He said the word habit and let the Council taste their own exhaustion. Kestrel spoke in the measured way of a person who does not rise unless there is rope to climb. She described the difference between responsibility and ownership like a poem written by a locksmith. A boy in a cap with opinions etched into it asked a question about what happens if the Keeper turns out to be a person you wouldn\u2019t let feed your cat, and the old woman with the leather voice said, sweet as syrup, that\u2019s why we have commas.\n\nThey were three arguments in when the bees arrived as promised and not scheduled. They did not swarm so much as convene. A hum arranged itself in the air like an agenda. Men who used the word optics for lunch flinched because optics have never forgiven bees for not attending their launch parties. The bees moved around the room with clean determination, avoiding faces, landing on the rulebook, landing on the edges of the chairs, landing on the loop of Kestrel\u2019s braid like punctuation considering employment. Granny Nell had, at some point that morning, exchanged pleasantries with a beekeeper in a jacket the color of a green market and invited the bees to consider governance. Bees consider quickly. They crowded the comma in the clause like jurors.\n\n\u201cThis is fine,\u201d Lara murmured from the doorway, her clipboard staying notably still because she had learned the life-saving art of not fanning a situation into melodrama. \u201cThey\u2019re calm. We\u2019re calm. No sudden gestures. We will all pretend this is how policy is made because, in fact, it usually is.\u201d\n\nA woman from the Keeper\u2019s legal office made it into the room wearing a smile upholstered in guidelines and announced that while she respected all pollinators, bees were not a recognized stakeholder in the Code\u2019s language. Nico said bees have always recognized language, and the woman wrote something down that would later be authoritatively misused. The bees eventually left on some signal invisible to everyone except a pale boy in the corner who had been timing the humming with his fingers, and the room let out a breath it did not know it was holding like a held note that finally made peace with the end of a song.\n\nHe took his hour where it didn\u2019t fit, and Kestrel took it with him. The map folded itself into his pocket as if numbers had turned into origami cranes while he wasn\u2019t looking. The door to the Under-levels opened when Lara produced a key that technically did not work for that lock, and he thought again, with gratitude, about the dignity of people who know how much help to be. The air changed three steps down, reacted less to perfume and more to the sincerity of mildew. Pipes ran along the walls with the patient arrogance of old bones. Somewhere a pump sighed and forgot to be discreet, and a clamp, tightened seventy-four years ago by someone who whistled dirty verses, held on.\n\nThe Throat did not announce itself with trumpets because trumpets are wasted underground. It announced itself by becoming the only conversation the room wanted to have. It was not a single thing; it was an arrangement. Where two broad ducts met and narrowed there was a nexus built with the hubris of people who had never tried to move a piano through a narrow door. Valves clicked. Gates leaned. A framework of bronze in the shape of a throat sat so neatly into the brick you might think the brick had made space of its own accord. Kestrel stopped to stare at the bracket because even a person who had promised herself to scoff at allegory had to nod when faced with engineering that had a personality.\n\nThe bracket had been shifted. He saw it with the same part of him that read fittings by touch. A gouge on the bronze where a tool had slipped and been caught. A scar on the wall where someone\u2019s boot had braced. A smear of a grease that had already decided to turn to dust and failed because it loved too much. The weight sat on the wrong side. The words in his head rearranged themselves from swear to solve and back again, a good rhythm for difficult tasks. If he wanted to move it, he would need leverage; if he wanted to live, he would need permission; if he wanted to keep either, he would need a story.\n\n\u201cDo not,\u201d Kestrel said, and the \u201cdo\u201d contained an instruction sheet and a recipe for regret. \u201cWe will not pull anything in a room where, if we cough, the city sneezes. We will take a picture, we will take a measurement, we will take our desire to a meeting and refuse to apologize for its volume.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are correct,\u201d he said, while his fingers traced the old position in the air, which made the plant in the oath room rustle in a way he could feel in the back of his neck. \u201cBut if you were to, purely hypothetically, hold that end up three degrees while I push, the leverage we could achieve would\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2014get you elected to the emergency ward,\u201d she said, and he loved her because it felt like being forgiven before he sinned. They left The Throat with an intimacy reserved for places that would swallow you if you told the wrong joke. They carried with them the knowledge that somebody had moved a pause with a spanner and gotten paid with a better seat.\n\nChortle was waiting for them on the steps when they reemerged into day the color of a freshly unrolled graph. He wore a tie with tiny suns that somebody had told him meant optimism and not glare. A camera nearby heard his voice lengthen its vowels and decided it was nourishment. He congratulated Nico on his pilot as if it had been mutually agreed upon at a neutral resort. He mentioned that WorldStart had launched a companion initiative called PairFlow that matched donors with noble causes and required only that the noble causes never speak rudely about fruit. He said the word synergy in a tone that suggested French origin and all the vowels fell on the pavement like coins.\n\n\u201cI just saw a bracket that used to be a promise,\u201d Nico said, because lying to Chortle would have been a degree of disrespect the chimp had done nothing good enough to earn. \u201cI will move it back when I have a crowd large enough to make metaphor into a video. You are welcome to bring your suns and your cameras. We\u2019ll need light for the bolts.\u201d\n\nChortle blinked because clarity makes most salesmen itch. He asked whether anything that would affect markets would occur in the next twenty-four hours so he could not be blamed in the right circles, and Kestrel said markets have had centuries to learn to swim. He held for a second as if considering the power of his own options, and then exercised the most useful one: he stepped back three feet and allowed events to happen without him. It is the sort of generosity no one can teach. It\u2019s the kind he could take credit for later.\n\nGranny Nell instructed the bees to be available for a half hour in the afternoon and then sent him a note through Lara that said, in a handwriting you could ride a bicycle on, If you do pull the thing, warn the tea. The plant in the oath room had been tied with the cloth; gossip wafted from it like a sermon you\u2019d go to for the snacks. He went there to ask its consent, because there are only so many mistakes you can make before you run out of friends, and the plant obligingly leaned toward him as if smelling the part of his breath that did not lie.\n\n\u201cI have lived under six Keepers and two false gods,\u201d its caretaker said, confirming that people who love plants have the best job of all in rooms that tend toward performance. \u201cIt likes you because you lower shades and speak as if wood has done you a favor. If you must move the hardware below, give it a song to concentrate on. Plants do better when no one expects them to be clever about policy.\u201d\n\nHe chose a time that did not exist in the schedule, and Lara created a paper butterfly that landed on an assistant\u2019s desk and made them cry in a way that translated to permission. April met them on the stairs with a handful of muffins that had been legally de-weaponized; she said the press had sniffed out the story and wanted adjectives. He said the adjective was \u201cunder,\u201d and she said that was a preposition with mood disorders, and that would have to do.\n\nThey did not go alone. The electric workers from the morning\u2019s pilot came with tool belts and the expression of people who were done applauding incompetence in anyone with a title. A woman from the river\u2019s office came because water liked to see how metaphors enacted themselves. The boy with the timing fingers shuffled down with a face so bright he could have guided ships, accompanied by his mother, who had brought a bag of almonds in case governance fell low on blood sugar. A reporter came and, having learned something during the bees, left the long lens upstairs and brought a notebook that could sit quietly. Chortle surprised him by sending a junior\u2014an earnest macaque in a shirt that didn\u2019t fit\u2014who sat on the bottom step and wrote on the back of his hand a single word: pause.\n\nHe did what Kestrel told him and what Brindle suggested and what his grandmother would have done if a stove had started an argument, which is to say he hung his impatience in the doorway and spoke to the bronze in his palm as if it were a dog with dignity. They chocked what needed chocking. They wedged what asked to be wedged. Kestrel placed her shoulder where his fingers would have defaulted, and three electricians used their language to sweeten the bolts. He took the spanner in both hands and counted to the right number in his head so the muscle in his forearm that had learned to listen wouldn\u2019t get offended. When he pushed, the city made a noise like a person taking off a tight shoe.\n\nThe bracket moved. He felt it settle. He felt a line unbend that he had not known was in his spine. Upstairs, under the plant, in the oath room where light pretended to be civilized, the cloth around the pot loosened and tightened once, like a heartbeat that had been holding itself very still for company. In the Sidekick Bureau, a return key on the big screen resisted a memo for a second and then allowed itself to be pressed by an assistant who had been pressing keys for a living long enough to know when the keyboard wanted something different. In a corner of Brasshaven where five small girls practiced tightrope on a painted line, all five stepped in unison without instruction and laughed with the shock of pulling it off. In the depot across town, a helmeted man stopped halfway through a generosity-free sentence and discovered he was too tired to finish it. Pulling that bracket was not a revolution; it was a tilt. Sometimes tilt is as much as you get. Sometimes tilt is the beginning of not falling.\n\nThey stood back and waited to see if anything would leak. It did not, unless you count relief. Kestrel looked at him with a face that contained both safety and something that might be friendship if it was allowed to grow without adjectives. The boy with the timing fingers nodded, satisfied without explaining who he\u2019d been counting for, and the river\u2019s emissary said the water would be sending a note in due course, accompanied by a list of chairs it had approved for trial sitting. The electric workers clapped without irony and without that careful distance people acquire when applause becomes a job, and it did a thing to him he didn\u2019t know how to hold yet.\n\nThe monkey in the shirt that didn\u2019t fit approached with a caution that might have been trained and might have been born. He cleared his throat and glanced at his hand where the word pause had become a gray smudge, and he said that his boss would want him to ask if this action had been cleared with any of the committees whose job it was to engineer approvals for things the city had already done. Nico told him no, and the monkey smiled as if the word fit his teeth and took his pen out to write it down again.\n\nThe press tried to make it about bravery. April kindly tripped and spilled muffins in front of three cameras in a pattern that nudged their angles toward reassuring blur. Lara compiled a bullet list that didn\u2019t look like a bullet list and called it a brief, and Chortle released a statement that used the phrase technically within the scope of my optimism with such skill you could hear interns being promoted somewhere across town. Granny Nell sent a text that said that was not the sound of a city sneezing, darling, that was the sound of a city refusing to be polite about its allergies.\n\nThere were consequences because even good tilt requires payment. The orangutan with the red scarf convened a breakfast wherein spoons clinked against bowls in a way that felt like voting, and he asked in a voice gentle as knives whether the Keeper had considered how many investors would be offended by a city that practiced self-respect under its own floors. The Moderator sent a polite memorandum reminding Nico that some levers existed not to be pulled but to inspire letters. The Sidekick Code Council received three strongly worded emails containing the word exigency and sturdily ignored two of them. The capuchin in pearls had the grace to send a bouquet of lilies that smelled like retirement and a note that said I admire a man who lowers a shade.\n\nThat night, when the meetings had stopped but hadn\u2019t, the apartment received him like an object familiar with returns. The jam machine had taken it upon itself to manufacture a thin disc of ruby that tasted like cherries and insomnia. His grandmother sat cross-legged on a kitchen chair reading a booklet from the Office of Linguistic Standards, which she was defacing with a series of cats as if to give it something to do besides scold. She set the booklet aside when he came in and listened with her whole face, which is a skill she had offered everyone she loved and denied everyone who had tried to take it for free.\n\nHe told her about the bracket, and the bees, and the small change in the city\u2019s inhale. He told her about the letter and how the Throat felt like touching the underside of a promise. He told her about the monkey writing the word no on his hand and Kestrel\u2019s distinct relief at not being asked to carry something absolutely ridiculous on the first week. Then he told her about the woman who had been framed by his doorway and had brought a cake that was a hat and a sentence she owed herself, because sometimes you have to report aloud that a thing happened or the thing remains a rumor with your face.\n\n\u201cShe brought a second letter,\u201d Nell said, and once again the room\u2019s stillness became a musician\u2019s pause instead of a doctor\u2019s pause. \u201cYou did not see it because I am greedy with drama. It is not for you. It is to be delivered to a machine under a bridge that hums the names of cities we have not built yet. I intend to walk there in a dress with the right hemline for history and make the delivery in such a way that pigeons will believe they have witnessed ceremony. If you want to come, you may. If you do not, I will lie to you later in a way that teaches you nothing.\u201d\n\nHe believed her, which is better than believing in lots of things less durable. He believed her when she implied that the city\u2019s enchantments had synergies with its appliances, and that his mother would know where to send a letter because she had lived with the sound of movement for two decades without asking permission to set it to music. He believed her when she said Wasp Day was going to be important in a mood he had not yet guessed. He went with her because the tradition of keeping is often just walking behind a person who knows the way and not correcting their sense of direction.\n\nThe Seventeenth Street bridge was not on speaking terms with the river that night and that was fine because the river did not love conversation in public. The transformer under it hummed like a brain agreeing to sing. The hum was uncannily close to a catalogue. It seemed to be listing not just cities but rooms, the way a librarian recites shelves to locate a missing book. Granny Nell held the letter between thumb and forefinger as if balancing a biscuit and bent down like the world had put its footstool in the right place. She tucked the letter into a seam of the transformer\u2019s housing with the authority of someone mailing a dangerous invitation.\n\n\u201cDo you think she really invented keeping, in the way one person invents a game by playing it so earnestly everyone else is embarrassed,\u201d he asked, and allowed his surprise at how gentle his voice could sound when the river was paying attention.\n\n\u201cI think she did it and then refused to patent it,\u201d Nell said, straightening and wincing like a woman who had carried more than her share and never sent the bill. \u201cShe would have been an excellent patent. The kind that ends up on aprons.\u201d\n\nThey stood there a while in a quiet that felt like work being done elsewhere. The transformer hummed out a city that had not happened yet and he heard its name as both insult and promise: Underkeep. He felt along his throat for the whistle, reassured once more by the cool pressure of an emergency. The hum shifted up a key the way a bird changes direction when invisible wind takes a vote and then dropped back as if agreeing to watch tomorrow closely.\n\nIn the morning, he woke to messages that tried to decide whether he was good or simply inconvenient. Kestrel sent him a list entitled Things To Avoid While Half The City Has Opinions, which included open microphones, ladders, and speeches where the word hero was a noun. Lara texted him a photograph of the plant wearing the cloth like an old soldier pleased by a new scarf, and underneath she wrote, Good tilt, would tilt again, and then, more seriously, There is a leak in the laughter invoices. Someone with access has been diverting mirth into weather systems. Side effects include fog that knows its own joke and morning shows with slightly less venom. We have a meeting. Bring reasonable metaphors.\n\nThe Sidekick Bureau had expanded its spreadsheet to include a column for pilots that did not photograph well. Screw Coupling had attracted a volunteer list of people who weren\u2019t famous but were used to being necessary, and he had a moment in the hallway where all he could do was stand against a wall and let the shock of being joined wash over him like cold water after a hard day. The monkey board at Peel & Prosper scheduled a breakfast with the title \u201cClarifying Partnerships,\u201d and a memoran on his desk suggested mildly that his office should avoid creating the impression there existed mechanical linkages below city infrastructure that responded to policy punctuation. Old men who had trained their hair to lie wrote in elegant blue jotting that he was irresponsible, and kids chalked his name beside a picture of a pipe with confetti coming out of it and expected nothing except that he would not step on the drawing.\n\nHe walked into the meeting about laughter expecting to hear a story about cartelized merriment and heard, instead, the outline of a larger design. Chortle\u2019s name was on the third page next to a column that said distribution logistics, but his signature was nowhere near the paragraph that assigned rights. The name there made the Moderator blanch when he read it and caused the capuchin in pearls to make the tiny sound people make when a shoe anticipates a foot. It was an old name, small in the mouth, the kind you pull out of drawers when you are packing to move and find yourself sitting on the floor considering going back to bed: Quorum.\n\nQuorum, as Lara patiently pointed out, was not one person. It was the entity that convened when enough important chairs sat down in one place and decided that their legs, taken collectively, made a table. It had only ever signed two things\u2014once a permission for a masquerade to burn itself safely and once the white paper that became the Important Crime-Fighting Act\u2014and each time, something physical had changed under the World House. He learned this with the sullen fascination of a person who has always suspected the city had two sets of stairs and now had the map and a flashlight. He learned, while April exhaled in the corner as if someone had just loosened the back of her dress, that Quorum had commissioned a second machine eleven years ago not to carry directives but to filter them. The filter sat in the laughter invoices, in the dye of city flags, in the sugar dispensers at public events, in the gloss on press badges when lights hit right. It made joy behave. It made outrage tasteful. It kept certain verbs from gathering too many friends.\n\nHe wanted to find a pen and do violence to capital letters. He wanted to eat something that would make him strong enough to throw a crocodile at a meeting. He wanted only to go home and list everything that had gone right that week on the back of a receipt and read it until his eyes watered for an uncomplicated reason. Instead, he threw the text of Screw Coupling up on a screen and asked the room if anyone was thirsty for jobs that looked small enough to forgive. He did not say the word sabotage because Chortle had sat down and crossed his legs like a person who had chosen to be in the bystanders\u2019 photograph. He did not say the word mother because if he did he would be asked to explain a hat cake and he did not think anyone would behave around such a confection.\n\nHe stepped outside with Kestrel during a lull that no one had authorized and looked down into the square where a girl in roller skates deployed a line of plastic cups like a parade of tiny marching opinions. The sky had chosen honesty and was practicing it by refusing to settle. He could feel the city\u2019s drains working the way you can feel your own blood flow when you remember to sit still, and for a second he considered how much of keeping is not action but keeping the right silences from being turned into walls.\n\n\u201cFirst week,\u201d Kestrel said, in the tone of someone finishing a fable so the children would have something to tuck under their pillows. \u201cDo you feel proud. Do you feel tired. Do you feel like calling in a favor that no one has actually promised.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, and smiled because it was an answer and an indictment and a promise to meet the morning somewhere that was not polite. \u201cAlso I feel like my calf muscles have become information. Also I feel like I have been handed a verb and asked to carry it safely to the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen put it in your pocket,\u201d she said, not looking at him, because partnered kindness should never look you in the eye unless you ask. \u201cAnd for the love of early mornings, when the bees arrive again, make sure the tea has been warned.\u201d\n\nThey warned the tea by drinking some and pretending it was brave. They warned the river by asking what it preferred to be called during formal sessions. They warned the plant by singing an old show tune in an off-key sotto voce and the plant rewarded them by dropping a leaf onto Lara\u2019s hair which somehow improved her arguments for the rest of the day. They warned no one who would sell the warning for a stipend. They went back down when the transformer hummed a new city, and when the letter under the bridge wriggled against the metal like something trying to hatch, they waited with their hands in their pockets and their shoulders square and their mouths closed, because sometimes the best kind of keeping is what you do when you suspect the room is about to know more than you do and you decide not to interrupt.",

                              "content": "Chapter 8\n\nThe morning came up laughing and refused to apologize. Fog had rolled in from the river and taken a course in manners; it gathered itself at corners and bowed before crossing streets. It giggled whenever it found a traffic light trying to maintain composure. People stepped into its softness and came away with chuckles in their hair. A woman on a bicycle stalled at an intersection because the fog whispered a joke about socks to her calves, and three suited macaques were overheard demanding to know who had authorized the humidity to distribute punch lines. Brasshaven had always been a city that exhaled stories, but this was different. This was weather that had been taught to flirt.\n\nAt the World House the fog flowed through the columns and sat politely on the marble like an audience waiting for the first violin to admit how much it wanted to be a drum. Lara\u2019s text arrived before he\u2019d opened the blinds. Laughter filter has breached containment, she wrote, precise as always. Morning shows softer. Commuters more forgiving than traffic warrants. The river is pleased and alarmed. Quorum has sent an invitation. It looks like a summons dressed as a brunch.\n\nHe dressed in the shoes that felt like they had been given a briefing. The whistle settled under his shirt like a fact. He made tea that had been sold to him as a small mistake and found, in his grandmother\u2019s kitchen, a note propped against a jar of marmalade that read, in a handwriting that had once been forced to swear in court, Don\u2019t let them eat the fog. It looked like the sort of joke you frame for later. It tasted like warning. Nell herself stood on a chair adjusting a string of paper lanterns that had never yet been invited to be formal. She wore a jacket the color of old news, which on her became prophecy.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to contain it as branding,\u201d she said as if telling him about the weather and not war. \u201cThere\u2019s a tent downtown with fog in it and a line of people paying to be lifted a quarter inch by their own faces. Tell them no. Tell them the fog has better things to do than seminar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve sent a summons,\u201d he said, fastening the badge as if there were a way to make it go on straight when the world had not yet settled. \u201cQuorum wants to talk. Or perform talking.\u201d\n\n\u201cWear their chairs like hats,\u201d she replied, stepping down and catching his chin with fingers that could still take a splinter out blind. \u201cWhen they ask you how you plan to make people behave, ask them how they plan to make people want to. The two are cousins who only speak at funerals.\u201d\n\nQuorum\u2019s chamber was not a chamber, because rooms do not, strictly speaking, convene. It was the posture a building assumes when enough powerful chairs decide to sit at once. The air had been pressed into fairness. The walls had found a tone that discouraged confessions and applauded efficient lies. A ring of tables circled a ring of microphones, each one rehearsed to make any voice sound like it had remembered, all on its own, to be reasonable. The faces around the table were the sort of faces that never started rumors because they were the rumors. The Moderator sat as if the chair had finally, after long lobbying, agreed to take his weight without comment. The capuchin in pearls had brought her sadness and polished it. Chortle perched three seats back from center, practicing that studied attentiveness which allows a person to claim later that they were present at the birth of something important and had never once thought of diapers.\n\n\u201cWe are concerned,\u201d said the voice that belonged to Quorum without being any specific mouth. It arose from the ring the way steam rises from a pot you didn\u2019t intend to boil. \u201cThe laughter invoice system is experiencing leakage. Events in the atmosphere suggest the filter is offline or operating in a manner inconsistent with the public good.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public likes to laugh,\u201d Nico said, and watched a vein on the Moderator\u2019s temple suggest that while laughter was all very well, liking it was the kind of thing you said on buses and not at tables. \u201cAlso, if you intend to weaponize fog, do it with permission from the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have interfered with an aspect of the city\u2019s mechanical dignity,\u201d Quorum said, and the words sat in the room like chairs being moved when somebody you loved was asleep. \u201cBrackets are not for amateurs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI moved a pause,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019d put it on the wrong side. Partners were being turned into advertisements. The city was translating nouns into credit ratings. I put back a breath you took away with a wrench because you were impatient with air.\u201d\n\nThey would have yelled, in a circle that believed itself above the need to raise voices, but the fog slipped under the door and asked everyone to be ridiculous for twelve seconds and a half. Twelve seconds of soft chaos. Pearls took a nap in a cup of coffee. A macaque undid his tie in a gesture that made three capuchins remember their first summer of adulthood and forget their scorn. Chortle\u2019s pupils expanded as if someone had told him he could say whatever he actually thought once and the sky would not crash. The moment ended as moments do when they become too visible. The fog moved on. Quorum found its tone again and handed out consequences that had the weight of nicely folded towels.\n\n\u201cCease all unsanctioned interventions below,\u201d came the verdict, wrapped in the unhelpful virtue of committee. \u201cReport to the Laughter Clearinghouse and accept the oversight of the Filter Authority. Submit pilot programs for rebranding to ensure message discipline. You will refrain from summoning bees without apian consultation. You will be invited to a gala.\u201d\n\nNico inhaled and let go of the vision of hurling a succulent at the nearest carved arch. \u201cI will not submit to a structure designed to make joy behave,\u201d he said, steady, a single syllable longer than a hiss, a single syllable shorter than a speech. \u201cI\u2019ll visit the Clearinghouse and ask it if it agrees to being your faucet. If it does, we\u2019ll negotiate. If it doesn\u2019t, we won\u2019t. I will not supervise fog for your donors. You can sell T-shirts that say Keep Calm to anyone who wants to wear them. I\u2019m here to look at the pipes.\u201d\n\nAfterward, Kestrel joined him in a hallway only slightly less choreographed than the chamber, a hallway in which a painting of a bridge had been hung so that it would always look like it had been installed a hair off-plumb, a perpetual goad to those who believed in levels. She had acquired a smudge of fog on her shoulder that looked like it liked her. She handed him a folder that smelled faintly of hot paper, neatly corralled by Lara, with an address scrawled across the top in a hand too practical to be called elegant: The Clearinghouse for Civic Levity, established in the bones of the Gold Finch Theater, three blocks off Riverline, beneath a marquee that never got around to saying goodbye.\n\n\u201cApril stole this for us while Chortle waxed bespoke about PairFlow on the radio,\u201d Kestrel said, with a satisfaction that only partly derived from a successful theft. \u201cThe Clearinghouse is a machine made of clerks, invoices, and a well-meaning ghost. If you ask it politely, it turns joy into tokens you can redeem at palatable moments. If you ask it rudely, it corrects your grammar. We should go ask it a bad question and see if it tells the truth anyway.\u201d\n\nThe Gold Finch Theater was a building composed of second chances. Its gilt had refused to tarnish just because life had gotten damp. Its velvet had become threadbare and proud. Children had kissed in its balcony and grown cynical in its dress circle and come back when they needed to remember what surprise looked like. Now its front doors hung open under the dying flowers of the marquee and a board inside presented a menu that read, in a beautiful hand: Current Program: Redirection of Spontaneity for the Good of Civic Health. The price list below suggested rates for applause by the minute, laughter by the fraction, and delight by the kilo, which would have been satire if not for the clerk with the tidy bun who raised her eyes and asked if they had an appointment.\n\n\u201cWe have a leak,\u201d Nico said, because people who stand behind desks like to begin at the part of the story they can assign a number. \u201cThe fog is telling jokes on corners without codes. I\u2019ve been told by chairs to ensure that the Clearinghouse manages that \u2018consistency\u2019 with something called oversight. I want to see the machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re in it,\u201d the clerk said, the small smile of a person satisfied to be metaphysical without trying too hard. \u201cBut yes. Downstairs. Sign this consent that says you will not accuse the Clearinghouse of crimes against spontaneity. It is delicate. It will pretend not to hear you for the first two complaints to give you a chance to rephrase.\u201d\n\nDownstairs was a transformational skeleton. A stage ran along one end where a blackboard labeled Invoices Pending held back a tide of paper. A series of ducts hummed along the ceiling as if the air had opinions. The machine itself was less a machine than a choreography: a central pump that bore a resemblance to an oversized typewriter; columns that concealed within them scrolling mirrors; a set of wires strung like lines of music between wheels; and, impossibly, a faintly amused temperature. Kestrel touched a copper fin and withdrew her hand, not burned, but having been informed that this was not the fin to touch first.\n\n\u201cI have no interest in making joy behave,\u201d Nico said to the room, the pipes, the clerk, the typewriter, the ducts, the ghost he could almost but not quite see reclining on the fainting couch the theater had left backstage when the past had moved out. \u201cBut I am interested in reminding it where its pockets are.\u201d\n\nThe typewriter rattled and refused to answer on the first complaint. He tried again, and again, because rules like that are baked into devices by people who imagine themselves saving you from yourself. On the third complaint as per the manual, the pump burped out a little ticket. It read: We are set to divert seventy percent of uncontrolled laughter into scheduled celebrations with the approval of Quorum. We are also set to redirect thirty percent of uncontrolled laughter into fog, as per emergency protocols last invoked during the Year of the Unpersuasive Parade. Your settings are dated. Your defaults are tired. Please advise.\n\n\u201cWho set the fog,\u201d Kestrel asked the clerk, watching the machine with the same eye she reserved for rooftops. \u201cDates. Names. We don\u2019t need a cautionary tale. We need someone\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\nThe clerk flipped a page with the satisfaction of producing homework that had been done. \u201cEleven years ago,\u201d she said, \u201cduring the Act. The filter was, I am told, one of the protections. It was supposed to keep crowds from becoming mobs and mobs from becoming armies and armies from becoming embarrassing. The instructions came from Quorum. The machine is not a person and does not take bribes, but it loves authorization like opera. If you write a better song, it will perform it.\u201d\n\nNico thought about the bracket. He thought about bees learning the taste of clauses. He thought about The Throat and about the transformer under the Seventeenth Street bridge and about the letter that hummed now in its seam like a tooth about to declare itself. He thought, in a way he had not permitted himself since he was eighteen and wrote sloppily righteous memos to people who stayed up late outmaneuvering grammar, about rules being true for long enough to become habits. He looked at Kestrel because she had the specific kind of sense you develop by holding other people\u2019s rope.\n\n\u201cIf we were to,\u201d he said, slow enough the machine could be an interpreter and not an enemy, \u201cwrite a new default with no budget line for joy capture and a big fat budget line for joy circulation, what would break. What would bend. What would simply have to learn new trousers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe invoices,\u201d said the clerk, instantly. \u201cMy desk. The parts of the city that like to authorize confetti. Peel & Prosper\u2019s consulting deck. The kind of gala you attend in shoes that want you to sit down immediately. Quorum\u2019s faith in chairs. You. Also, possibly, any gathering larger than a pantry if somebody with malice tries to make it into a weapon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe saw a weaponized absence,\u201d Kestrel said, surprised by how bitter the picture looked when she painted it aloud. \u201cWhen nobody laughed, everyone got tired enough to accept doors being installed where they used to walk. Let the laughter go. Let the fog have opinions without invoices. We\u2019ll build something else for emergencies that actually addresses emergencies and not enthusiasm.\u201d\n\n\u201cName the new default,\u201d the machine typed, impertinent in the way of a device that had started a union and gotten away with it. \u201cMachines are happier when named. Humans, too, but you call it something else.\u201d\n\nHe did not want to call it Hope because there are only so many times you can pour that word over a wound and pretend it is antiseptic. He did not want to call it Freedom because freedom had been dragged around behind too many cars lately. He settled on the word Underlaugh because it felt like a private river that learned to share and because it would offend exactly the people he wanted to attend the next council and argue their best. Kestrel grunted approval and added a clause that would allow specific block captains to flip the emergency filter if a crowd became cruelty accompanied by matches. The clerk stamped the paper twelve times with a stamp that had been hand-carved from a spoon. The machine accepted the program, ripped the word Quorum politely off the old authorization like a bit of lace you save for patching, and printed a new set of tickets for the laughter\u2019s wayfinding.\n\nIt didn\u2019t all shift at once. Nothing worthwhile obliges the impulse toward montage. But the fog brightened as if someone had complimented its plume. A festival two neighborhoods over that had been threatening to behave became honest about its games. A morning show tried to be less venomous and discovered they had human tongues and not blades. Lara texted a small series of clapping hands and then a question: Will you come out onto the steps and tell the people with clipboards that this is a pilot? He sent back: It\u2019s a valve. She replied: I need a word with a consonant the press can put on a bar chart. He typed: Underlaugh. She wrote: You are not easy to print. Thank you.\n\nChortle appearing on the theater\u2019s edge was a surprise and was not. He had the air of a person who had rediscovered milk in coffee and wanted credit for the invention. He watched Kestrel with a respect he hid behind compliments about her braid. He complimented Nico on his sense of timing and did not mention that the chairs had just had a small, coordinated fit. He said WorldStart was prepared to launch a sub-brand called WeatherKind that would sell umbrellas that told jokes you could record yourself and asked for a blessing that wasn\u2019t a blessing. Nico told him to sell umbrellas to people who stood in the rain in order to be seen, and let the rest of the city borrow from each other.\n\n\u201cQuorum will sulk,\u201d Chortle said, and there was something almost wistful in it, the way you talk about an old boss who would have been excellent if not for his mouth. \u201cThey do not like it when pipes turn back toward the people who wash their hands in them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can get used to it,\u201d Kestrel said, as if that were a chore and not a policy. \u201cWe did.\u201d\n\nHis grandmother did not wait for him to finish being clever on the steps. She had gone to check on the transformer under the bridge with a basket of biscuits and a minimum of witnesses. He arrived, later, as the light tried on evening, and found her seated on an upturned crate like a queen who had refused to be bothered by chairs. The humming had changed timbre. It had become less endless and more old song. April crouched with her, knees up, making a face at the way the concrete tickled her shins, and Lara, who hated to give anything away, had eased her back against a pillar with the look of a person who knows there are only so many chances in a day to be a human in public and had chosen one.\n\n\u201cIt hatched,\u201d Nell said, nodding at the transformer with the pride of a midwife. \u201cIt took its time because letters have to decide what they\u2019re going to be. It wasn\u2019t a chick. It wasn\u2019t a permit. It was a key, and not to a lock. The kind you put in a person when you want them to be able to close the door behind them without feeling like they\u2019ve betrayed anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat door,\u201d he asked, ducking under and feeling the hum carry up his arm to a nerve that only fired when someone told him he had done a useful thing.\n\n\u201cMine once,\u201d she said, not sorrowing in any obvious way, which was her secret magic and his inherited curse. \u201cHers later. Yours now if you need it. It gives the bearer the right to leave a room where keeping is no longer what you are doing but only what you are acting. It breaks nothing except expectations. It is not to be used except when you cannot do otherwise. It fits in your pocket and weighs nothing until you need it.\u201d\n\nThe metal piece she pressed into his palm was warm with transformer and old guilt. It had no teeth, which made him think for a sharp second of all the things that have done their damage without biting. April watched his face in the way people only do when they\u2019re too tired for pretense and too fond for decency. Lara had her hands in her pockets because sometimes you need to keep your fingers from chiming. Kestrel arrived late, bringing the smell of rain and rehearsed restraint, and sat on the edge of the crate as if it had been set there to get her height exactly where it needed to be.\n\nHe did not ask the question that had been performing somersaults at the back of his mouth for three days. He asked a different one and found it came out like an apology that had decided to do useful work. \u201cWhy did you and she do it without me,\u201d he said, even though he knew that this city would never be gentle with the answer. \u201cTwenty years. Letters in machines. Keys hatched under bridges. I would have made tea. I would have fetched chairs. I would have asked questions you could have answered or fed to pigeons. You let me grow up thinking keeping was something done by other people with hats and clipboards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe let you grow up,\u201d Nell said, and if there was any cruelty in it, it was the kindness\u2019s shadow. \u201cIf you had come to the machines as a child with your mouth open for the first drink, you would have swallowed the city and never tasted your own tongue again. You do not owe us forgiveness. You owe us soup sometimes. You owe us remembering that hero is not a noun. You owe us that when you leave\u2014because you will use that key one day\u2014to do it without needing us to tell you that leaving is not failure, it is just geography.\u201d\n\nHe carried the key as if it were a bird that had decided to trust. He tucked it in with the whistle and the banana pen and the note from the child about the rats and the token for sandwiches, and he realized his pockets had become a museum exhibit called Assorted Salvations. He wanted to tell Kestrel, in the dumb exact way we tell people about our pockets when we want them to understand our skins, but she was watching the river and he let her, because the river had adopted her for the next three minutes and he would not get in the way of that.\n\nThe next day the laughter did not stop, it simply forgot to be captured. Video of three teenagers dancing with shopping carts under fog that looked like a friend\u2019s breath went very small and very viral. The Sidekick Code Council managed to agree to dislike a clause and love a comma. Peel & Prosper announced a new initiative to pair bananas with yoga mats and tried to call it cultural heritage. The river stole a hat from a man who had never once laughed at himself and returned it when he convinced a toddler to stop crying without saying anything about bravery. Quorum grew very busy with lunches.\n\nMid-afternoon the Clearinghouse spit out a stack of tickets that looked like a surrender and smelled like cinnamon. The clerk carried them to the World House with a small, holy grin and a self-knitted scarf, and read them into the record during a session so boring people had brought puzzle books to stay awake. The tickets said: Underlaugh engaged. Fog considers being a citizen. Filter remains available for fires and speeches. Block captains empowered to decide when fun is a weapon. Laughter invoices reduced to advisories. Quorum removed from authorization path. Please bring biscuits.\n\nThey brought biscuits. Not because the machine had asked, though that helped. They brought them because nothing good lasts without crumbs. Granny Nell made a plate that could have fed a committee minus the one who always says no because he likes the shape of his lips when he does it. April set out a pile of napkins that had been printed with a world that had refused to sit still long enough to be printed. Lara stood by the plant and adjusted the cloth by a quarter inch because something about the sling made the leaves look steadier. Kestrel leaned against a pillar with a cup of tea that was not daring to pretend it could help and thus managed to.\n\nChortle showed up as if summoned by the smell of competence and knelt to say hello to a child who had gotten past the cordon because somebody had the good sense to let him do it. He looked up at Nico with a grinning fatigue that implied the price of the bananas had been paid in meetings. \u201cYou are not going to make money off this,\u201d he said, without rancor. \u201cYou are not even going to get the right kind of film for your re-election.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not a poster,\u201d Nico said, and he meant it all the way down to the wrench, and for a second Chortle looked homesick for a sentence he had not been allowed to say in a decade.\n\nThey were all very busy not saying the word mother out loud in case it spooked something. They were also very busy not acknowledging that the machine under the bridge still hummed the name Underkeep whenever anyone looked at it in a way that resembled wanting. They were also very busy with a pilot that did not photograph well and a bracket that had become steady and a plant that knew, in a way most rooms do not, that gossip saves lives.\n\nThe word came without ceremony on a Tuesday afternoon that felt like a rehearsal. A boy whose job it was to ride a bicycle between places with folded paper announced, in the doorway of the Sidekick Bureau, out of breath and pleased to be the messenger of his own story, that the helmets were not gone. They had moved their depot and found a new drain. He added, careful with his hands, that somebody had been seen walking at the edge of their shadows with a coat that did not change and a cake tin, and had not been swallowed. He added, nervous, that someone else had sold a map of chairs to a monkey board for a price that was the wrong kind of low.\n\n\u201cEverything again,\u201d Kestrel said, with the relief of not being bored and the grief of work. \u201cBut tilted. We go.\u201d\n\nThey went, this time with more than a wrench and a whistle. They went with an electrician walking backward and a river emissary on a bicycle, and April\u2019s notes stuck to her own sleeve because the fog had refused to carry stationery, and Lara\u2019s calm like a net that can hold a sharp fish, and two council members who had decided it was time to see whether code meant anything in bad light, and Chortle at a distance because he can only be useful for free in a ratio of one to ten. They went with the key in Nico\u2019s pocket and a promise in his mouth that did not yet know who it belonged to.\n\nThe depot had moved into a decommissioned laundry where old signs insisted you separate things the way people with calmer lives always advise. The helmets were there, practicing a choreography that would have been beautiful if it had even a single kindness within it. The false drain in this place was a throat that did not believe in pauses. The wires were wound like unplayed violins. The laughter had been siphoned off into jars that wouldn\u2019t open for anyone poor. On a wall in chalk an inventory wrote itself in a hand he did not like as if a person\u2019s shame had been trained to write cursive.\n\nThey could not fix it in an afternoon. They fixed one thing cleanly: they convinced the building to remember its own plan. Nico put his cheek to a pipe the way you do when you want someone to tell you what their parents did, and he found the line under the floor, older than Quorum, older than the Act, older even than the false drains. He tapped it. Kestrel tapped next. The river hummed under the bricks like a cat who knows it has been invited into the kitchen. The line responded and flexed and then, with a slightly smug sigh, reconnected to the city\u2019s idea of itself. It did not dump the helmets into holes. It did not spill their wire into the street. It simply diverted the path from pity pit to public. The jars of laughter refused to stay sealed. The fog arrived, laughed once, and left for a block where people had been having trouble remembering what sunlight did. The helmets, faced with a room that had lost its appetite for their geometry, looked suddenly tired. One sat down and removed his hat. He had hair the color of someone you forgive and hands that had been told too often they were only good for closing.\n\nOn the way back to the van, they passed a wall where someone had written in tall, unpressurized letters, THE WORLD IS NOT A SINGLE THING; DO NOT TRY TO KEEP IT, and someone else had written underneath, BUT DO KEEP ITS DRAINS, IN CASE, and someone else had added, AND ITS LAUGHTER, BECAUSE. He wanted to underline because and make the ink as stable as a well-installed bracket. He wanted to go home and tell his grandmother a joke before she told him a story. He wanted to lower the shade in the oath room and tie a new cloth around the plant that read we are not going to behave, and mean it.\n\nThat night, when the fog curled itself up on the windowsill and took a little sleep, he sat with Nell at the table and watched the jam machine working through the night in a patient stutter. She had taken apart a watch and laid all its gears in a circle like men at a public meeting. He told her everything again, because repetition is a kind of keeping, and she listened in the way of a person who knows that some stories need to hear themselves to harden. When he ran out of words she reached across and touched the place on his shirt where the key lay and nodded as if to say she approved of the shape it made.\n\n\u201cThursday is Wasp Day,\u201d she said, as if they hadn\u2019t earned it. \u201cI\u2019ve asked the wasps to hold their stings and show up in waistcoats. They agreed on the condition that you explain to the Sidekick Council why bodies are not automatic alibis. Bring them cake. The wasps, not the Council. The Council should fast. Tell them if they cannot tell the difference between being obeyed and being listened to, they cannot tell the difference between verbs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring cake on my head,\u201d he said, and she nodded because some sentences come true when you don\u2019t make a face at them. \u201cAnd when Quorum invites me to another brunch?\u201d\n\n\u201cBite their napkins,\u201d she said, and went back to the gears. \u201cMake a nest in their silverware. Tell their forks there is a better table across town. Wear your shoes. Don\u2019t step where the ink wants you to. Put the word under in your pocket. Learn a new song for the plant. Sleep.\u201d\n\nHe tried. He dreamed of the transformer under the bridge hatching envelopes that flew to their addresses on small, worried wings. He dreamed of the typewriter in the Clearinghouse learning to giggle at its own jokes and then deciding it was undignified and giggling harder. He dreamed of Kestrel unsnapping her braid and a clause falling out. He dreamed of Chortle with a banana that did not even make a performative case for itself. He dreamed of a city named Underkeep entering the room and asking if anyone had a spare chair. In the dream he said no, all the chairs are liars, sit on the floor, and the city did, and the floor held, and someone brought biscuits because they had learned you cannot do this without crumbs.",

The fog had learned not just how to flirt but how to leave politely, and its jokes now landed like kindnesses at crosswalks. Brasshaven wore a mood that made storefronts open a fraction earlier and monkeys in ties glance at their reflections as if wondering whether sincerity might be a skill to practice on lunch hours. The laughter no longer queued for invoices; it ran errands, and in the alleys it traded recipes for how to survive a meeting that wants you to become an anecdote. Nico woke to the sound of the kettle speaking in proverbs and the jam machine purring as if it had adopted a philosophy. On the table, his grandmother had left a scrap of paper that said if they try to sell you your own verbs back, ask for a receipt, which was less a warning than a map folded wrong on purpose.\n\nHe did not make it past the second sip of tea before Lara called, her voice balanced like a tray in a crowded room. She said Quorum had gone to ground in a building they hadn\u2019t used in public since the Year of the Promising Umbrella. She said a new office had been conjured by committee and then discovered tucked under a staircase with a fresh coat of authority: the Registry of Actionable Verbs. She said the Registry was issuing licenses that would assign to world leaders the right to deploy certain verbs in conjunction with sidekicks, and that the pilot for \u201cNo\u201d was already live. People would have to apply to say no in contexts Quorum defined as strategic, and the application would include a box for justification longer than the breath you had to take before using the word. \u201cThey\u2019re making grammar into a permit,\u201d Lara said, and her calm did not quite conceal the part of her that had wanted since childhood to stand on a table and tell adults to stop touching language with sticky hands.\n\nGranny Nell, tightening her bun into a promise, did not wait for permission to be meddlesome. She assembled a satchel with the quickness of muscle memory and included the jam machine as if it were a distant cousin who did well at weddings. She added a spool of string, a roll of labels that read property of no one, two paper hats that would be cake later if need be, and a wrench wrapped in a dishtowel because some tools prefer modesty. She mentioned in passing that the Registry lived under the library in a vault called The Lexicon with a door that had been designed by a person who believed locks should be moral lessons. \u201cIf the door tells you a story,\u201d she said, as if arranging chairs, \u201cinterrupt it. Stories love that if you do it kindly.\u201d\n\nThe World House had been watching itself lately, suspicious of mirrors. The plant in the oath room adjusted its leaves toward the part of the ceiling where secrets liked to gather and let one drop like a hint. Kestrel read the motion as if it were a memo and looked up; she had begun to keep a list of the plant\u2019s opinions and had stopped being embarrassed about it. April arrived with a packet of biscuits labeled educational material, which would get past two levels of security more easily than any memo, and Lara produced passes that did not technically exist and handed them out with the air of a person flinging seeds at a paved lot while believing stubbornly in roots.\n\nThe Municipal Library was a broad-shouldered building that had learned contempt for shoe squeak. Its lions had been repaired twice and now wore the sort of expression statues put on when they have decided to forgive their admirers. Inside, the air had a candor that made ballpoint pens nervous. The Lexicon door was exactly where Nell had said, at the bottom of a stair that had memorized every ankle that had ever hesitated. The door did not have a handle so much as an invitation. Lines of text were chiseled into the brass in tidy rows and then interrupted by a sentence that refused to finish because it was waiting to hear whether the person standing before it deserved an ending. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those,\u201d Kestrel observed, feeling for the seam where doors and performances part company. \u201cTell it a story about tools,\u201d Nell recommended, lifting her chin so her municipal plum lip could glare down the engraving.\n\nHe told the door about the first time he had stripped a thread and saved it anyway with patience instead of force. He told it about the drain under the Vulcan Depot and how false runs discover themselves in your hands when a rumor has been doing the engineering. He told it about the bracket under the World House and the feeling in his forearm when metal consented to be reasonable. Halfway through, the door sighed as if relieved to be allowed to stop auditioning for itself and unlatched with a theatrical click that tried and failed to be demure. They went in together, close enough for their shoulders to agree.\n\nThe Registry did not look like a trap until you noticed how many filing cabinets had been trained to consider themselves architecture. Desks were arranged like chess pieces that had memorized two strategies and refused to be ashamed of it. Clerks moved with the efficiency of a game you cannot win and forget to stop. In the center of the room perched a device that had not decided whether it was a loom or a printing press and would not be pinned down. It hummed. It rearranged stacks of cards as if playing an energetic patience alone. Above it, on a lattice of wires, words hung to dry. They glowed faintly with ownership. NO had a hook through it and a tidy tag. REFUSE sat in a basket as if it were fruit with rules. ENOUGH lay very still, which felt like a threat.\n\n\u201cWelcome to regulation,\u201d said a man with the grooming of someone whose hair had voted against reform twice. He wore a badge that read Acting Registrar in an italic that wanted to be admired. \u201cWe are here to protect the citizenry from the misuse of decisive language. Verbs move crowds. We assign them. We prevent collateral metaphors.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour verbs are hung by their necks,\u201d Kestrel said, so conversationally the room took a second to notice the cruelty she was pointing at. \u201cAlso, your commas are sulking.\u201d\n\nThe man smiled the smile of a person who had complained to management about semantics and won a framed apology. He explained how the permit system would work with the ease of someone calling a poison by its brand name. Leaders, approved by the Registry and advised by Quorum, would file a request to deploy, say, stop in association with a mass gathering. The Registry would calibrate the request against an index of approved outrages and authorized delights, then return a license stamped with a duration and an emotional tax to be collected later via sanctioned festivals. Sidekicks would be allowed access to a subset of these licensed verbs depending on their photogenic risk. Anyone found to be using a restricted verb in an unsanctioned context would be fined a moment and assigned a white paper. \u201cIt\u2019s all very civilized,\u201d the Registrar concluded, with that special tone people use when they have taken something living and scrubbed it with words like civilized until it forgets to breathe.\n\nLara had put on the face that saved you from embarrassment when someone speaks nonsense with conviction. April had put a biscuit on the corner of the Registry\u2019s loom as if softening would travel through metal. Granny Nell composed her expression into a recipe you never shared except with stubborn radiators. Nico felt the whistle against his sternum and considered the tonality of this room. He imagined blowing and hearing drawers fling themselves open in a tantrum. He imagined slapping property of no one on every hanging word and watching hooks fall out of their letters like teeth that had been lying for a living.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not here to apply,\u201d he said, and the device, thirsty for script, hiccuped at the novelty of someone in this room declining an index. \u201cWe\u2019re here to remind you that verbs belong to mouths. They come with breath included. No is not a municipal resource. It\u2019s a spine. You do not sign spines out and then fine them for touching the air without gloves.\u201d\n\nThe Registrar produced a document that had trained itself to be charming in the first paragraph and then got down to business. It cited the clause in the Important Crime-Fighting Act that allowed committees of sufficient seating to regulate rhetorical devices during states of declared civic gusto. It referenced the Year of the Unpersuasive Parade and the time a mid-level nuisance had sung a city into doing stupid, kind things for a week. It referenced, without humor, the bee incident. \u201cWe are not censoring,\u201d he said, which is what people always say right before they do. \u201cWe are coordinating. If you wish to use refuse at scale, you will refrain from improvisation.\u201d\n\n\u201cRefusal without improvisation is just bureaucracy in an evening gown,\u201d Nell murmured, and the Registrar pretended not to hear because he had never yet managed to win an argument with a woman wearing confectionery on her head.\n\nKestrel leaned on the nearest cabinet with the familiarity of someone in a storeroom who knew which boxes had mice, and she described, without raising her voice, what happened to a crowd when leaders took away their verbs. She told them about helmets. She told them about a false drain and a pity pit and what happens when you make humiliation into infrastructure. She told them about a comma restored and a plant that listened and how people breathed different when their words came back to them unsupervised. While she spoke, Lara rearranged her papers so that the least interesting ones ended up on top, discouraging admiration. April quietly emptied the Administrator\u2019s dish of peppermint tension pellets onto a napkin so no one would try to chew serenity into their teeth.\n\nThe Registrar moved to a switch on the loom, a little lever designed for ceremonial deference. He flicked it and showed them what the device could do. On the wire above, NO brightened, was weighed, and dimmed to a tolerable hue. REFUSE fluttered its thousand meanings and had three shaved off for neatness. The labels rattled; the loom printed a permit with lace on the corners. It was, Nico observed with a nausea so precise it made his palms damp, beautiful. This was the kind of bureaucratic beauty that kills. He reached into his pocket not for the whistle but for the key and felt its shape like the outline of a decision. Not yet. Keys are not for rooms where you can still stand up without lying to yourself, his grandmother had once said while balancing a cake nobody ate because it had been too handsome to live. He put the key down inside his chest again and instead took out a label.\n\nProperty of no one looked small on the loom\u2019s casing and achieved the kind of quiet that has teeth. It attached itself to the machine with an obedience that felt like betrayal\u2014for two seconds\u2014and then became the most natural sticker that surface had ever worn. The hum changed key because even devices have egos. Beneath it, the old soapstone tiles made a small, encouraging noise, as if the building itself had been waiting for somebody to call ownership impolite. \u201cDo not vandalize,\u201d the Registrar said evenly, reaching for a form that had been designed exactly for this eventuality. \u201cPlease cite grounds.\u201d \u201cGravity,\u201d Nell said, setting the jam machine on the desk and pulling its lever like a priest with different hobbies. \u201cAnd hospitality.\u201d\n\nThe jam machine, good at peculiar emergencies, produced not jam but a thin, shimmering film that looked like puree and behaved like amnesty. When April slid it under the loom\u2019s intake rollers, the device snorted the way equipment does when you feed it something it wasn\u2019t designed to eat and discovered a taste for unruliness. The film adhered to the next set of permits, erased their adjectives, and returned them to the world as blank invitations. Lara, never one to be left without paperwork, took the freshly cleaned permits and wrote in careful, legal hand, Community Notice: You already owned No. Use with care and generosity. The Registry was scandalized and, being a device of procedure, started looking for step two of scandal.\n\nKestrel\u2019s scandal was the one that matters, which is to say she opened a drawer that had never been opened by anyone with muscle, and the noise of it cracked the room\u2019s porcelain composure. Inside lay lengths of chain. Each link had a word stamped on it, verbs that had been put into harness: Obey. Comply. Behave. Accompany. She lifted a chain the way nurses lift instruments in old movies and held it in the light. The words gleamed with a servility that made Nico\u2019s throat close. \u201cThis is supposed to be metaphor,\u201d the Registrar said, and his voice finally let a little of itself out, tattered and uncertain. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to pick it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hung No on a hook,\u201d Nico said, and the machine, sulky, spat the truth onto the platen in a font you couldn\u2019t argue with. \u201cWe are going to spoil your metaphors until they retire.\u201d\n\nThey could not shut the Registry down cleanly because the Registry had long, careful roots. But they could tilt. They could retune. Lara found the authorization for the looming of No and filed a form revoking Quorum\u2019s seat in the chain of approvals, citing the plant\u2019s rights to shade. April called in four librarians who had a longstanding grudge against decorative punctuation and set them to work handwriting new defaults on the paper the Registry had intended for pronouncements. Nell moved through the room with the serene arrogance of someone who has reinvented dinner when the stove exploded, peeling property of no one labels and affixing them to verbs with a measured rhythm that made clerks steady their hands rather than slap them away. Kestrel, the least sentimental among them, climbed a ladder and cut the hooks until No fell and REFUSE stopped pretending to be fragile. The words did not fly. They stood up and walked back into pockets, which is how verbs prefer to travel when you\u2019ve bothered to ask them.\n\nChortle arrived exactly wrong and perfectly timed, bearing a tray of coffee and a facial expression that had gone to two rehearsals and never met the scene partner. He took in the room, the chain, the labels, the jam machine drying its conscience, and whistled softly between fine incisors. \u201cOh dear,\u201d he said, setting the tray down on a ledger like a picnic on a grave. \u201cQuorum is going to call this vandalism, theft, and a branding disaster. From me they will want an argument about fences. From you they will want a narrative in which you tripped and landed on a lever. From themselves they will want a reason the public doesn\u2019t love you for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could give them a banana,\u201d Nell suggested in a voice as kind as salt. \u201cTell them it\u2019s a theory. Tell them they peel it the wrong way. Tell them the city does not eat bananas for its breakfast. It eats meetings and must be fed reality for dessert.\u201d\n\nSomething in Chortle\u2019s face conceded before his mouth did. He glanced at the loom, noted the sticker, and did the one useful thing he could without compromising the part of him that needed to survive in expensive rooms. He rotated the tray so the cups faced the Registrar and said in a tone sappy with small talk that the Registry would need to suspend operations while they logged the interruption, paperwork being paperwork. Suspended operations meant the room had to stop making decisions until it had told itself a story it could stand to live with. It bought an hour, and in that hour Lara did what a person like her does when you hand her a crack in the plaster: she widened it into an entrance.\n\nThe Lexicon\u2019s ceiling had always been proud of the words it held. It had, for decades, been a net that caught phrases before they fell into lawsuits. Now it sagged like a cloud making a point, and as the loom\u2019s rhythm faltered the whole apparatus that kept verbs in conjugation with permission hiccuped and then leaned into its own tiredness. Aboveground, the library exhaled and people reading in carrels looked up, startled by a hush that felt like an apology for having taken so long. Across the city, places where \u201cNo\u201d had been rusted shut tried their handles and found the hinges had been oiled by morning fog.\n\nHe would have liked a tidy ending and a cupcake. He got a memorandum from Quorum that called him reckless in excellent cursive. He got, five minutes later, the kind of weather that has thought through its reasons. A front rolled in with the manners of a debutante and the intentions of a union. It was a polite storm. Rain fell in neat lines as if drafted by an intern who had been told to respect property lines. Lightning did not crack; it gently annotated. The wind insisted on \u201csir\u201d and \u201cma\u2019am\u201d with a frequency that made strangers on corners smile in helpless discomfort. The forecast described it as intermittent courtesy with a chance of exasperation. The polite storm parked itself over the World House and waited to be invited inside.\n\nThe Oath room absorbed the drizzle in its shade like a plot. The plant rustled and did not flinch when a raindrop found its leaf, which was all the blessing he needed. They lowered the shade again, slow enough that the air could adjust. People came\u2014not invited, exactly, but welcomed by the floor. Sleepers from the trambed. Librarians smelling of paper and dust considered divine. Young sidekicks with capes folded under their arms so as not to conjure wind. Old sidekicks in civilian jackets with their code thick in the creases. Someone\u2019s baby who would remember none of it and all. The Sidekick Code Council filed in and pretended not to have crumbs on their laps from biscuits they hadn\u2019t eaten because adrenaline can be a poor friend to appetite.\n\nHe told the room what they had done with verbs and what they planned not to do with chairs. He introduced a proposed addition to the Code in language that did not apologize for being plain: silence shall be considered rest and not consent; pauses shall belong to the people who take them; no is not a noun we can collect and rent back at a discount. The polite storm tapped its umbrella against the window as if to say it had notes. Kestrel spoke once and told the Council that she had carried too many people out of events where someone with a title had interpreted silence as permission and used it like rope. Lara did the arithmetic out loud so people in chairs could nod and feel competent. April worked the room as sugar does when you put it on tongues and watch hard stares soften into receptive faces. Nell sat under the plant, which had decided to wear its cloth like a ribbon for mischief, and watched three generations relearn what breath does between phrases.\n\nQuorum\u2019s emissary did not come to that session in the flesh. He sent a letter that had learned to be a gentleman and a courier with a hat he clearly wanted back. The letter asked, softly, whether the Keeper would consider restoring order to rhetoric. It offered brunch. It offered a seminar on de-escalation of verbs. It suggested, as if the idea had not already exhausted everyone in the room, that perhaps the city could agree to use No only with supervision and Yes always in public. Nico read it in full because he disliked the way skipping sentences rots the gums, and then he folded it, slid it under the plant\u2019s pot, and decided to stop answering mail in a voice that did not taste like his. \u201cWe are not in a relationship with your adjectives,\u201d he said, and the polite storm, relieved of its purpose, began to consider raining somewhere else.\n\nThe Registry did not forgive them. It did not write a thank-you note. It began to reconfigure its chairs so you could only sit facing a wall. The loom, out of spite, learned a new stitch that made ribbons of complaint with lace borders. They would be dealing with its moods for months. But the hooks remained empty over No and REFUSE and ENOUGH, and the chains went back to being paper. That was not victory. It was day.\n\nThat night he went home dragging a bag that had become a sampler of absurdities. The key lay against the whistle with a tact that implied an after-dinner conversation. The banana pen had stopped squeaking and now played a note that suggested creative sabotage. The note from the child about rats had been unfolded and refolded so many times it had learned to be a talisman. He sat at the table and watched Nell take a sewing needle to a shirt she had decided would look better if it had known boats. She did not ask whether he had won. She asked whether the city had noticed, which was smarter.\n\n\u201cIt noticed,\u201d he said, remembering the way the verbs had stepped off their hooks and straightened their hems. \u201cIt noticed like a body remembering to breathe without being told. There will be letters. There will be storms that say please and mean stop. We can stand up to please.\u201d\n\nShe threaded the needle and bit the end of the thread like a magician. She said that storms are theater with homework and not to be fooled by their diction. She said she had spoken to the transformer under the bridge and it had hummed back a suggestion that sounded like someone making coffee properly. She said Underkeep was getting louder by becoming quieter, which is a trick some cities learn when they decline to be distinguished and choose instead to be lived in. Then she did the thing she did when the day had been full of performances and she wanted her grandson to live through a private scene. She took out a tin and lifted the lid and offered him a cookie that had been saved just because saving something makes it important, and he ate it, because that is what you do when you believe in drains.\n\nHe slept badly and better. He dreamed he was standing in the Registry again, but the machine had turned into a bridge and words were crossing, some with umbrellas, some with luggage, none with permits. He dreamed the plant in the oath room told him a secret and he couldn\u2019t wake up until he understood it wasn\u2019t a secret at all. He dreamed Quorum invited him to a gala where the chairs were tired of being sat on and went on strike, and everyone had to sit on the floor and discovered their spines could be useful. He woke to the polite storm\u2019s last apology tapping at the window and the sense that the floor under his feet had agreed to something.\n\nBy noon the helmets had made their first polite robbery. They arrived at a corner bodega wearing sashes that read We Regret The Inconvenience and took only exact change from the tip jar. They left a note that said This Has Been An Exercise In Adaptation. They bowed to the security camera and then took it because theater hates surveillance. Kestrel read the report out loud and made a noise in her throat that suggested the pleasure she takes in a competent opponent was at war with the importance of never feeding that pleasure. \u201cThey\u2019re learning,\u201d she said, as she slung the backpack that always looked like it contained an extra shoulder. \u201cThat\u2019s when people get dangerous and interesting. Bring a biscuit. We will instruct them in other hobbies.\u201d\n\nThey found the helmets at the decommissioned laundry, sober as tax season, practicing smiles that would pass in rooms with carpets. The false drain had been patched and was now a false drain with a moral. The jars for laughter had been removed and replaced with a suggestion box labeled In-Kind, and Nico wanted to fill it with verbs that had learned to bite back. He did not blow the whistle. He did not make a speech. He asked the room whether anyone knew how to fix an unbalanced machine with a book and a string, and two helmets raised their hands, because criminality will eventually recruit competence if the job is to keep being possible. Kestrel set them to work roping off the pity pit so nobody fell into it by mistake. April posted a sign that said please do not contribute humiliation to this receptacle, thank you, and then wrote in smaller letters: contributions of courage accepted in aisle three. Lara took the name of every person who laughed when they didn\u2019t mean to. Chortle, at a cautious distance, ordered a round of coffee and insisted on paper cups, then wrote in the receipt memo line: for the return of verbs.\n\nIn the afternoon, the Oath room smelled of wet wool and argument. The Sidekick Code Council had reassembled to debate the breath clause now fully dressed in sentences. Those who had young voices argued it should have teeth and a curfew. Those with old voices reminded them that clauses are adopted like dogs and bite who they love if trained wrong. The bees did not come because they had been elsewhere convincing a school board that the word swarm need not be filed under panic. The plant flicked its cloth with a discreet flourish that made one man from Legal admit out loud that he admired flora. The polite storm finally left, flicking its hat brim at the door, and Brasshaven shook itself, grateful to be damp rather than lacquered.\n\nHe thought of the key all day like a pebble in a shoe that never quite found the sore it wanted. He did not know yet which door it fit because it didn\u2019t, not literally, and the city would not provide an instruction manual for a choice like that. He caught Nell watching him over her knitting with a look that contained instructions and refusal and a memory of carrying too much and a smile that promised she would forgive him for being slow if he didn\u2019t apologize for being careful. In the evening, he stood by the window and watched fog attempt comedy one more time for the late buses. The laughter came up from the street in a minor key, weary and available, almost a prayer. He thought: this job is not a noun. He said aloud, to the kettle, which had become his confessor, \u201cWe will make the next tilt. Then we will sleep. Then we will steal back another bracket.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Quorum produced a new punctuation. They unveiled it at a breakfast designed by someone who had fallen in love with triangles. It was a semicolon rewrite of the sidekick clause that would bind partner to hero for the duration of a declared narrative. The semicolon was a polite leash. It suggested sophistication while attaching one spine to another with silk. The Moderator held it up and the room applauded because rooms like that cannot help loving a semicolon. \u201cNo,\u201d Nico said, not with a permit, not with lace. He said it the way you tell a dog to drop a chicken bone before it makes itself sick. He carried the word like a bowl of soup. He did not spill.\n\nThe plant approved with a rustle. The registry, newly uncertain about its job description, sent back a receipt it did not understand for a transaction no one could process. The polite storm, bored with itself, went off to bother suburbs. Granny Nell wrote a list of groceries that included courage and onions and the phrase whatever is on sale in the department of practical magic. Kestrel sharpened her braid with a pin. Lara wrote a memo that was actually a love letter to pauses. April printed stickers that said silence is a blanket, not a gag, and dared the donors to peel one off without liking it.\n\nHe did not use the key that day. He walked around with it like a promise he had not earned and refrained from learning how it would feel in his hand when the door he needed to close presented itself. He thought, instead, about screws and couplings, and about gaps. He wondered how much of keeping was just this: removing hooks from words, putting commas back where they could do their old work, teaching storms to be less polite, and refusing to sit on chairs that prefer to talk. The city might want a different song tomorrow. Fine. He would learn it, hum it down a drain, and see what came up in the bowl.\n\nBy nightfall, Brasshaven had decided to be a small town for the space of two hours. People waved across intersections with an intimacy that embarrassed them later. Monkeys in shirts walked home with their jackets over their arms like men in paintings who had just discovered they had been wrong about something and were glad. The bridge hummed a list of rooms it would like to see repainted. The jam machine made a soft contented noise and spit out, without fuss, exactly enough sweetness for toast. Nell put her hand on her grandson\u2019s cheek as if to check for a fever in a story and told him with the tranquil brutality of love that tomorrow someone would demand an answer he didn\u2019t want to give, and when he refused, he would feel very good and then very tired, and he should buy good socks.\n\nHe laughed because socks were the kind of ordinariness that keep you from climbing onto tables every day, and then he folded himself onto the sofa with a tiredness that had stopped being performance and started being the cost of verbs. The window looked out onto a sliver of sky doing its best impression of a reasonable person. Somewhere under that sliver a door waited. Somewhere above it another bracket did not yet know it was about to be told what decency looks like in metal. Somewhere between, a plant practiced gossip and a transformer hummed cities into the future tense and a registry began to wonder if it had been built for a better purpose after all and had simply not been asked. He fell asleep with the whistle under his palm and the sense that if this was what keeping was, he could bear it until he couldn\u2019t, and then the key would weigh what it needed to, and in the morning, he would put his shoes on and go be inconvenient in the name of drains.",
