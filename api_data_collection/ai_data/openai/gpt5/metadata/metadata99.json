     "novel_text": "Blue eyebrows flickered under the street lamps like minnows kissed by an oil slick. In the alley behind the multiplex on Prospect, a clutch of teenagers\u2014backpacks, skateboards, one with a mouthful of braces\u2014were laughing too loudly at something private, something they\u2019d forget by morning and pretend not to care about forgetting. The air carried the damp aftertaste of warm rain and popcorn salt. On the theater\u2019s walls, posters for movies where the worlds end had already begun to peel.\n\nIt began like this: a breeze, a hush, a ripple in the dark like a giant someone walking soft. The kids looked up, not in unison, but nearly, because the human body is a tuning fork and something in them vibrated. A shadow muddled the star-bleared sky. And then a sound like a soda bottle being opened, a cork of carbonated night\u2014pop\u2014and then a long, keen hiss.\n\nThe youngest one, a boy with a hoodie tied around his waist, thought: comet. The tallest girl thought: crane. The one who would later become famous for a joke she regretted thought: it\u2019s just wind. And then blue spattered the concrete like laughter.\n\nThe foam came first, then the dye. It arrived in an arc, a bright, ridiculous curve like a rainbow not quite finished, and it burst over their heads. It didn\u2019t sting. It didn\u2019t hurt. It smelled, insanely, like lilacs; like the kind of grocery store candle called Mist of Spring. They screamed anyway, because the night had already asked for a scream. It wove through their hair, stippled their foreheads, found their eyebrows like a musical note finding its key.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s cold\u2014it\u2019s cold.\u201d Someone else cursed. A boy tried to wipe it off and managed to smear it into something truer and more permanent, as if he had been waiting his whole life to inherit his face from a joke. One of the girls laughed too hard and then choked on nothing. For all of them, even before the light returned, the blue was already drying.\n\nDown the length of the alley, a corrugated dumpster bore a single handprint twenty feet off the ground. It was not blue. It was pressure, a compressed palm in steel and dust. The imprint would be found the next morning by a sanitation worker named Albert M. who had not looked up at the sky in twenty-two years and, on seeing it, would become very quiet.\n\nPeople began to talk about the eyebrows. People did not stop, not that week. Parents blinked at their children across breakfast tables, and the children stared back, as if the face they had worn overnight were a magic trick, as if their eyebrows had defected to some other civilization of the skin and all the houses on that border had been painted the wrong color. The dye wouldn\u2019t wash out. It would lighten some, then darken again in the kind of humidity Champaign grew like tomatoes. Blue that wasn\u2019t quite indigo, wasn\u2019t quite cobalt. A blue like the idea of blue.\n\nWhat the kids who were caught first had in common, you could list in a way that made sense, until it didn\u2019t: teenagers. Out too late. Missing at least one next-day responsibility. Elevated BP compared to control group. A fondness for sauces. A tendency to kiss in empty parking lots and stop right before it mattered. Someone\u2019s mother, across town, working the night shift at Carle and humming because she always humming. Everyone had a story. Everyone has a story; sometimes the story has you.\n\nAbove all of this, higher than the movie posters, higher than the highest letter on the multiplex marquee (two bulbs burned out at the top), something enormous moved with a carefulness that broke the hearts of a certain kind of person when they saw it, the kind who cry at statues because they seem to be trying too hard. She ducked, always, around the telephone wires. She moved quietly between silos and the tall eucalyptus imported by individuals with too much belief in growth. A giant, they called her later, because what else do you call a woman who can reach over a gas station canopy and catch a sparrow tumbling out of the world? It\u2019s a poor word, giant, but we use it. Lynette, said a sign under a highway overpass, in aerosol script, not quite graffiti, more like an announcement whispered to a wall. Lynette. Love is fuel.\n\nDoctor Mariani didn\u2019t see the first eyebrows. She saw the other thing. She saw the handprint on the dumpster and folded her arms over her belly as if to keep her insides from sliding to the floor. She went out there because a former student texted her at 2:07 a.m. The text had a photo of the kids, faces blurred by motion, the blue not yet dry, and in the corner of that photo was sky, a sliver, a corner where you could see it was not nothing. She kept zooming in until pixels gave way. The shape was nearly shoulder. The shape was more like a hill. It was ridiculous to zoom like that, but she did, her breath a little too loud in the library still of her apartment. Her apartment smelled like old dry books no one had ever loved (though she loved them), and the radiator had its own weak opinions and said them at all hours.\n\nHer students called her Doctor M most of the time, to her face, but sometimes, when they were unkind or too kind, her full surname arrived with a point. Mariani. As if she were an airport one could circle without ever landing. It took three drinks in a noisy bar for her to tell strangers, if they ever got that far, that she\u2019d never slept with anyone. She said it like the color of her hair, factual, a piece of trivia that lived in the same drawer as knowing the state bird. Sometimes the men across from her were decent and the stalest thing they said was: your choice. Sometimes they were not. It did not matter, not now. She had a text on her phone and old tears on her face because the radiator had thunked and made her jump and she was tired. Morning was the study. Night had been trying for years to convince her.\n\nShe taught rhetoric at the university, but what she studied, between syllabi, in padded silence, was how a story becomes an organism. Urban legends made her, if we are admitting things. The way an untrue thing grows a skeleton, stands up, and begins to walk around. All the little lies get together, shoulder-to-shoulder, and become a body trustworthy enough to break your heart. She had a shelf of photocopied clippings: the phantom hitchhiker in Paxton, the haunted harmonium in Urbana, the cow that sat down during tornado warnings. In her notes the font was always too small because there were too many connections to waste space on letters. On her windowsill a plant reached for a light the window refused to admit.\n\nYou have to understand Champaign at night. You have to see the empty lanes like veins, the MTD buses sleeping cleanly in rows, their engines clicking as they cooled. The water towers like shoulders in the distance. The far hum of the interstate, and how it\u2019s not a hum at all but a chorus learning to pronounce the word go. That first week, the days were gold and powdery and the nights stung with a sweetness that made people kind and reckless.\n\nHer student\u2019s name was Farouq and he was the one who brought it to her because he had read her paper about monsters with the wrong name. He worked nights at the multiplex tear-down crew and one of the kids who got splurged came back with his face blazing and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Why blue? Why me?\u201d They weren\u2019t asking for absolution. He was twenty, Farouq, and used to people\u2019s grief falling apart in his hands. He sent the photo and then two words: it\u2019s her.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d she asked when she called.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d he said, and somewhere behind him a machine rolled and rolled and tried to swallow cardboard.\n\nThey met in the alley. She wore her one pair of sneakers like a disguise. The dumpster\u2019s handprint caught the light from above. She had to reach up with her fingertips to just trace the bottom of it, and the steel was cool and a little oily and there was dirt packed into the grooves where the world had been pushed. \u201cNot a crane,\u201d she said aloud without meaning to, because one is often alone at night even when someone else breathes nearby.\n\n\u201cDid you see her?\u201d she asked, but she did not specify who, as if there were only one possible answer now in the whole lexicon of answers.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything. The kids were screaming. It was... There was this hiss. Like this,\u201d and he tried to make the sound but it came out as an impression of a dying balloon.\n\nA splurge-gun, said the rumor later, a gigantic ridiculous thing like something out of a musical where kids shoot custard at each other for the final number and no one dies. The splurge looked comical until your face was blue and your friends were blinking at you in that new way that stings more than any acid. The papers\u2014yes, there are papers, old ones that say things you don\u2019t expect\u2014had used the word in 1979. A \u201csplurge device,\u201d teens marked with dye on a dare, in Kankakee. It had been reported as prank, no giant involved, no decent photographs, but the word burrowed in like an egg. Dr. Mariani has a gift for seeing words tunnel things.\n\nShe spent three days with her eyes too wide open. Sleep stayed out of reach, polite and cruel, like a party happening two doors over. She read every post tagged with bluebrow in the first hour, then stopped, because the point at which a joke turns into a weapon is quiet, and she didn\u2019t want to watch that part in real time. She walked to the corner store on Third at 4 a.m. and the woman behind the counter looked at her face as if the blue might be there already. She bought a notebook and a pen that promised it would not skip. She wrote: she will be strong. She wrote: love is fuel. She wrote something else and then scratched it out so messily that now, decades later, that page looks like it was used to clean a wound.\n\nEveryone had a theory about Lynette. In the coffee shop on Wright that summer, the baristas wrote Lynette on cappuccinos with cinnamon. Someone in a bunny mask recited a free-verse series on the quad about giants and guilt. A boy whose eyebrows had been spared wrote a song and got in trouble for the chorus. People saw her in dreams. People saw her on the weather radar. There were grainy videos of a silhouette folding itself behind a water tower. There were blurry images of a hand tipping a water bottle to a parched dog. In so many versions, she was not villain at all, but a saint with no cathedral tall enough to hold her. In so many versions, she was exactly what you fear when you are very small and your parent says: I can\u2019t help you right now.\n\nWhat was not disputed, except by people who prefer not to see the world: the eyebrows were blue, and the blue stayed.\n\nDr. Mariani thought at first that her job would be identification. This is what scholars do, we tell ourselves, we say: this folktale rhymes with that one. This data set calls to this other. But she watched the ten-second clips and the fifteen-minute conspiracies and realized identification would be cowardice here. That she had loved monsters too much to see this one. That she had loved the idea of loving too much, too, and had smothered it to keep it from hurting her. In her apartment a spider spun a web between two bookends and the fly never came. She shook the web down in guilt the next day.\n\n\u201cI know where she\u2019ll go next,\u201d said Farouq three days into it, eating a sandwich he\u2019d made from white bread, cheese, something that might have been an onion, above the city map in the student center. They leaned over the glass together, their reflections cut up by the intersecting streets, two faces grafted onto the shape of a place that pretended it had one.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d said Dr. M. It was easier to let him be sure. It was easier to be enlisted.\n\n\u201cProm,\u201d he said, and then he had to laugh at himself, a breath through the nose that sounded like betrayal. \u201cOkay, not prom. But the thing at Hessel. The under-fifteen soccer thing. Or Homecoming. She\u2019s marking kids. She\u2019s going to be where kids are. She loves us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe loves you,\u201d Dr. M repeated, as if to hold the sentence until it stopped wobbling, and she saw him lift his chin, because who doesn\u2019t want to be loved by a god.\n\nYou have noticed, by now, that the rumor of Lynette always held that she was fueled by love. This was not a metaphor at the beginning. It was literal, or as literal as rumor knows how to be. The fuel was not chemical, not diesel. People swore they had seen it, the way a glow comes up through the skin, the way a face brightens when the person you have been waiting for walks into a room and it turns out to be you. They said that when Lynette took a step, it was because she thought of someone else. That when her hands opened it was because she had forgiven someone. A radio man on 92.7 The Drive, who had once been fired for laughing when a caller cried about the drought, said into his microphone, \u201cShe\u2019s a giant fuelled by love,\u201d and then the phone lines lit up.\n\nIt\u2019s obscene, said a woman who sold bread at the farmers\u2019 market, to mix love and weapons. She didn\u2019t mean weapons. She meant what it feels like to be marked. To walk into a room and have everyone know you have been chosen by something that doesn\u2019t explain itself.\n\nAt Hessel Park, on the Saturday after the first eyebrows, the air was crooked with kites. A clown inflated animals while a man with a clipboard asked people to sign up for campaign volunteer hours. Kids tugged their parents toward the shaved ice truck and someone under a tree tuned an instrument that would never play. Dr. M stood by the fountain and tried to look like a person. She carried herself like a quiet thing that had learned to put on a suit of noise when necessary.\n\n\u201cDoctor?\u201d someone said, and she turned and then had to look down because the voice was short. A girl, twelve maybe, with the blue not on her brows but in a stripe under her eye like a streak of royal war. The child smiled with the intense politeness of children who have been taught to present the world with their best manners because the world can be cruel. \u201cAre you the one who writes about ghosts?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d said Dr. M. \u201cUsually I write about people being afraid of things they shouldn\u2019t be afraid of.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike love,\u201d said the girl, very decisively, and then she handed Dr. M a folded piece of paper. \u201cShe says hi.\u201d\n\nDr. M did not laugh in the child\u2019s face, which is a triumph. She unfolded the paper. It was from the stationary set with the cartoon cats that sold at the bookstore on campus. The paper had been folded twice and then again, turning circles are circles because they don\u2019t stop. The handwriting was large, the way some people write when they want the pen to be as big as the feeling they carry.\n\nIt said: STOP IF YOU MUST BUT DO NOT CALL ME BAD. I AM MAKING THEM VISIBLE. IT IS EASIER TO LOVE WHAT YOU CAN SEE.\n\nShe put the paper into her left pocket and felt suddenly like her body had tilted very slightly toward the ground. \u201cDid she give you this?\u201d she asked the girl.\n\nThe girl shook her head. \u201cShe gave it to Mr. Rossi and then he gave it to my mom and then my mom said this looks like something the lady who writes about ghosts should see and then she said don\u2019t go over there, and I said why not, and she said because that lady probably wants some peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mom is probably right,\u201d said Dr. M. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cPilar.\u201d\n\n\u201cPilar, you did me a favor today.\u201d She meant it like a blessing. She meant it like a sea that knows the names of the fish who swim in it.\n\nPilar shrugged, as if favors were free, and then pointed behind Dr. M\u2019s shoulder, where a boy with sky for eyebrows was climbing up onto the edge of the fountain and holding a speaker over his head in a reference he probably had not earned. The speaker slipped; he caught it. Someone else laughed. The sky went thin, the way it does before wind. You could have said the mood changed. You could have said a giant had ducked beneath the canopy of leaves and was waiting for something like permission.\n\nThe splurge this time came from the north. Dr. M knew north not because she\u2019d been a Girl Scout but because she\u2019d walked these streets too long to pretend she didn\u2019t know where home was. It came as a cough, a burst, a comic timing that belonged to a world where edges are softer. It slashed across the heads of a little wave of kids running toward the soccer field. The arc caught four, missed one, painted two in a flourish that was almost calligraphy. They had time to scream and then to laugh and then to stop laughing. The dye dripped an instant and then held fast. A woman yelled, \u201cHey!\u201d into the sky a second before a toddler, amused by her own voice, copied her exactly. Dr. M was already moving.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d thought she would do. Tackle. Leap. Throw her arms out wide and say what needs to be said when someone won\u2019t stop doing the thing they say they have to do, which is: please don\u2019t.\n\nBut the shape that moved between the oaks was not a thing you tackle. It was a gentleness with weight. The giant\u2014Lynette, she must be Lynette\u2014paused, there, half her body hidden by the thick leafy fuss of a willow, one hand open as if waiting to catch rain. Dr. M stopped, because there are moments when you don\u2019t get to be a hero, unless you define hero as being properly humble.\n\nIn the hush there, Dr. M could hear something like two things pressed together: the steady drum of a big heart and the other thing, tinny, like a radio down a hall. She didn\u2019t know what the other thing was and later, when she did, she wished she had known then because she might have said a kinder sentence. The other thing was voices. The other thing was other people\u2019s names.\n\n\u201cYou will say I am cruel,\u201d said the giant, and her voice came like the last breath of air in a swimming pool. Not as words; as understanding.\n\n\u201cI will say you\u2019re choosing,\u201d Dr. M replied, forgetting she might be speaking to something that didn\u2019t speak her language the way she spoke it. \u201cI will say you are choosing a kind of pain and calling it love.\u201d\n\nLynette tilted her head, the motion so slow you could have set your watch by it if your watch were willing to tell you the truth. The sun slid off the top of her hair like water off an oiled duck. She was not beautiful the way a fashion magazine is beautiful. She was beautiful the way a wooden spoon is beautiful, worn down by stirring.\n\n\u201cYou named me in your mouth before anyone else did,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cYou reached for me with your words. Sometimes words are ladders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t name you,\u201d said Dr. M. \u201cThe city did. I\u2019m only a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a person who knows what stories eat,\u201d said Lynette, softly. She extended one hand, palm upward, and the air at the center of her palm was warm and brightening, and Dr. M had a fine, fine fear prick every pore and then settle as if at parade rest. Love, then. Fine. Love like steam. Love like something you could burn your tongue on.\n\n\u201cWhy their eyebrows?\u201d Dr. M asked, because academic is as academic does, which is: ask a small question that carries inside it a bigger question you don\u2019t want to admit out loud for fear of being sentimental. Eyebrows are ridiculous. Eyebrows are banners no one signed up to carry. Eyebrows are almost trivial.\n\n\u201cSo they can see themselves being seen,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cSo when they look mirrorward, they can\u2019t pretend. It is not punishment. You punish yourselves. It is an outline. The world has a terrible memory. I am reminding it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what?\u201d Dr. M said. \u201cOf who? You.\u201d\n\nLynette made the smallest sound. In a small mouth, it would have been a sigh. On her it was a wind on dry grass. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this without breaking something,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want me to stop, you will have to tell everyone to stop believing in the blue. Teach them that it means nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell a town what to think,\u201d Dr. M said. \u201cThat never works.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will be here a while,\u201d said Lynette, and then she turned her face and for the first time in a hundred small ways, someone saw her eyes. They were not the color of any dye.\n\nDr. M took a step because not to step is something only statues can afford. \u201cIf love is your fuel,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can choose a different road.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I,\u201d said Lynette, and there was no question in it. She bent slightly at the waist, so that her breath moved through the leaves and made the leaves speak in their own idiom. \u201cDoctor from Champaign. Virgin. Collector of ghosts. You carry so much not-doing like a trophy. You think if you do not, nothing will be done to you.\u201d\n\nIt would be possible here to write about the way the heart buckles like a folding chair. It would be possible to drag her history out into the open like a throw rug. We won\u2019t. She stood there, nonexistent height, looking up, and all the heaviness of never and maybe sat in her throat. \u201cIt worked, until it didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, not sure if she had meant to say it out loud, and a child behind her laughed at the way an ice cream slipped queerly off a cone. The world, persistent in its comedy.\n\nLynette opened her other hand. The splurge gun, if that was what it should be called, lay easy in her palm. It was a thing like a trumpet, like a toy. It was addled with stickers: a cat, a heart, a wistful face that might have been a cloud. It was absurd. It was so lightly made a child could have lifted it, if the child had also possessed hands the size of pie pans. The nozzle was caked blue as if it were a cake froster in the hands of a devout. She could have used it on anyone. She did not point it at Dr. M.\n\n\u201cWould you like to hold it?\u201d asked Lynette, like a tender aunt offers a baby to a cousin at a picnic. \u201cI can set it down. It will not spill. It only spills when I think of a face. I am disciplined. It isn\u2019t much. It is what I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hold weapons,\u201d said Dr. M automatically, foolishly, and then heard herself and wanted very much to laugh because how was this a weapon? How was it anything but?\n\nLynette laughed once, in surprise, right down in her belly, and for a second a flock of birds rose from the trees as if a storm had grumbled. \u201cYou hold a pen,\u201d she said. \u201cYou press it down. Same posture.\u201d\n\nSomething like falling began in Mariani\u2019s knees and she put her hand against the tree without permission. \u201cYou can stop,\u201d she said, and the edges of the words were blunt, because she didn\u2019t sand them down first. \u201cWhatever you think you\u2019re doing, you can stop doing it and not stop being who you are.\u201d\n\nLynette cocked her head again and her eyes moved to the fountain, as if the small rectangular clutch of water mattered to her in some old way. She made a small noise; maybe the noise only existed inside the bones of people who noticed. \u201cIf I stop,\u201d she said, \u201cthey go back to disappearing. If I stop, the world says: who? and it means it. I am not painting guilt on them. I am painting proof. When they are older they will say: that was me, and someone will believe them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re collecting them,\u201d said Dr. M, and she was still thinking as she spoke, always three seconds behind herself. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014archiving. You think archived love can last longer than now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey archive wars,\u201d said Lynette. She held the splurge gun like a brown bag someone else had packed for her. \u201cThey archive sorrow. I am trying balance. It is not fair. I am trying anyway.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other for another moment. It was not the kind of looking where a solutions pops up like a prairie dog and waves. It was the kind where you accept the terrible possibility that you cannot convince someone out of their self.\n\nA siren began and then thought better of it. The park breathed out. At the edge of the field, a coach cupped his hands around his mouth and called a name that might have been Marco, might have been Martha. It doesn\u2019t matter. It never matters which name, as long as someone says it.\n\n\u201cWill you stop?\u201d said Dr. M again. \u201cEven for a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a week,\u201d said Lynette, as if trying it on. \u201cI will stop when I run out of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou. All of you,\u201d Lynette said, and her eyes flicked over the park with its kites and a dog cropped too close, with its teenagers who had learned how to be looked at and then learned how to be looked away from. \u201cYou.\u201d She adjusted the splurge gun and for a second you could have believed she might hand it over. Instead she lifted it the smallest fraction of an inch, pointed it at the air above them, and squeezed. The nozzle spit a thin rope of blue that landed on nothing, made a brief, absurd ribbon hanging there, and then the ribbon fell into the fountain and became water again.\n\nA woman clapped, thinking it was a trick. A child clapped because clapping is how you tell your hands you are alive. Someone took three pictures and no matter how hard they tried later, none of those pictures would show anything more than a streak of sky and the corner of a hem. People want evidence and the world keeps a very tight budget.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me a curse,\u201d said Lynette to Dr. M, and for an instant resentment climbed up and then obediently sat. \u201cDon\u2019t write me like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said Dr. M, and believed herself. \u201cI will write you like a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Lynette, and then her outline became a little less outline. The edges of her did that thing edges do when the air is the wrong kind of hot, when everything seems to be wavering, when nothing will hold still long enough to examine. \u201cTell them,\u201d she said, \u201ctell them to find me in their faces. If they can bear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if they can\u2019t?\u201d Dr. M asked.\n\n\u201cThey will anyway,\u201d said Lynette, and then she was moving away, not like a retreat, not like a charge, but like someone who knows it is time to go because the light has changed color. She placed her palm on the water tower beyond the park just for a second as she passed it, the way people touch a doorway for luck. The water tower shivered as if it had been a long time since anyone famous had come by.\n\nDr. M stood there until a policeman who was too new at his job to be wary of quiet women approached her and said, \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d She blinked her face back into the face she used for students who turned papers in late and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d and he nodded in relief because his training had not covered what she was.\n\nIn the days that followed, the attempts to make it stop proliferated. There were banners hung from overpasses reading: YOU ARE SEEN. There were moms with their own eyebrow pencils trying to get ahead of it, blueing their faces first and walking into high school gymnasiums with the righteousness of saints. There were sermons. There were laughs. A boy turned seventeen with the blue still luminous over his eyes and he said, into a camera in his bedroom, \u201cThanks for noticing I exist,\u201d and then he threw the camera onto his bed like a grenade and the internet applauded. A girl shaved her eyebrows off entirely and got in trouble for not following cheer team code. The dye didn\u2019t care. The dye is indifferent to hair. It clung to skin. It stayed when you tried to outrun it. It faded and then there it was again. People began to confess things to strangers on buses. People began to not meet each other\u2019s eyes. The blue became a way to talk. The blue became a way not to.\n\nDr. M made a map on her wall with yarn that didn\u2019t quite match. She pushed pins into Champaign, Urbana, and then farther out, Savoy, Rantoul, Mahomet. The footprints were never footprints. The photographs people took of Lynette\u2019s passing were always of what she did not leave: the air folded where she had been, a branch with a new arc to it, a stoplight that would not stop blinking. She wanted what the giant had left out. We all want the negative space, from time to time. That was Dr. M\u2019s vice and virtue both.\n\nAt night she sat at her kitchen table and wrote sentences down that did not yet know they were a book. She wrote, she is not a warning. She wrote, she is not a promise. She wrote, the teenagers are more resilient than we are, and then scratched that out and wrote, the teenagers are carrying something we left on the side of the road because we were tired.\n\nShe dreamed that Lynette stood outside her window at three floors high and tapped gently on the glass. She dreamed that the splurge gun made a noise like a mother making a silly noise at a baby. She dreamed that she was thirteen and that her eyebrows were so vivid they could not be borne. She woke with a taste like coin in her mouth and the radiator putting on airs. She wanted to call someone and say: I am afraid of a good thing. Instead she went to her desk and made a list of all the places a giant might hide between Urbana and here. The list included quad. The list included the big lot behind the Meijer. The list included church steeples, not because they are tall but because they are always telling you where to look.\n\nA letter arrived in her campus mailbox. It had no stamp. Someone had slid it into the slot as if the man at the counter were a confession and this was absolution. The paper was the same. The handwriting larger. It said: YOU WILL THINK I AM PICKING ON THEM. I AM NOT. THEY ALREADY THEY ALREADY THEY ALREADY. Then a long line of blue. As if the sentence ran out of itself.\n\nShe took the letter home and stared at the repeating words until they stopped being words and started being a remembering of a time when you said a thing out loud to make it real. They already what? They already are vanishing. They already are brave. They already are marked in other colors you cannot see. There are so many ways to fill in any blank; the danger is you pick the one you are hungriest to believe.\n\nA week in, there was a late-night show segment where a comedy writer in a suit papered over his nerves with a monologue about the Big Blue Brow Bandit and her youthful victims, and Dr. M turned the television off because the laughter wasn\u2019t going to help. The world can joke itself into any position it likes. The world can laugh all the sharp edges off a thing and then claim it was safe all along.\n\n\u201cAre you going to stop her?\u201d Farouq asked, the next time he saw her, on the steps of the English building where the brick fights quietly with its own age. He was holding two coffees that he thrust at her like they were answers. He looked older suddenly, the way people look older when they finally decide to say everything they\u2019ve been thinking.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me to make her a villain,\u201d Dr. M said, as if this were the same as saying yes.\n\n\u201cWhat does she want?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants help being right without having to be wrong first.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sounds like a professor,\u201d he said, and she barked laughter up into the bright September, and students with eyelashes like tactical gear looked over, then looked back down at their phones.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop her,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think stopping is not an option. Redirecting, maybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cRedirect her where?\u201d he said, and stepped aside for a skateboard that came humming.\n\n\u201cTo the parts of town where no one watches,\u201d Dr. M said quietly. \u201cAsk her to mark adults. Ask her to mark the sheriff. Ask her to mark me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d he said, and got a look on his face like after you dare someone and they say fine, and you realize you were never brave enough for the dare.\n\nDr. M tried, that night, in her apartment, with the window open and the night like velvet borrowed from a theater. She spoke to the air as if it were an answering machine and she had only a minute to say everything. \u201cMark me, then,\u201d she said, voice steady in the grossly ordinary room. \u201cMark me for all the men I didn\u2019t love back because it was easier. Mark me for the kids I played fair with and the ones I gave up on because it was easier. Mark me for the glass I didn\u2019t break to get to the other side. Do your blue if you must. And then let them go.\u201d\n\nShe slept, finally, and woke with her face tingling and thought for a foolish three seconds: yes. She ran to the bathroom mirror and saw only her own eyebrows there: human, unremarkable, busily not blue. She laughed and cried at once for a minute, an ugly sound. On her way to the stove for coffee, she saw the note on the table, and picked it up as if it might be hot.\n\nIn the margin of her own letter, in her own room, between a paragraph and the word however, a smear of blue had dried in a small, tidy slash, like a punctuation mark from a foreign grammar. Not on her body. In her book. A mercy or a teasing. She touched it. The dye did not come off on her finger. It had a smell like a candy she had loved and then grown out of. She smiled in spite of herself and because of herself both.\n\nThe next morning the town woke to find the grain silo on the south edge of town had a new sign, a stripe of blue that ran from its lip down to the ground, dazzling, impossible. Someone with drone skills filmed it with swooping anger. It was a ridiculous sacrament. The silo wore it well.\n\nThis is not a story with a man in a uniform nailing a giant\u2019s ankle to the ground. This is not a story with a tranquilizer dart. That first month, the city council held a meeting that lasted four hours longer than it needed to because a woman named Judith refused to stop telling the room about the night in 1988 when she had shaved her head and no one asked her why and how that had saved her life. In a town where nothing is ever much of an emergency until the sky changes colors, people learned to say: we don\u2019t know. It was a kind of holiness.\n\nDr. M went to sleep every night with the sound of someone else\u2019s heartbeat in her ear, a borrowed noise the city had learned to make. In the thin hour between three and four, she heard footsteps sometimes. Not outside; in her head; in the map room. She moved pins around and stood on a chair to reach the top of her own wall and wrote: stop me if I say villain. She wrote: be fair to the kids. She wrote: be fair to Lynette. Be fair to the city that loves a good story because it is bored and also because it is aching.\n\nOn a Sunday evening, when the orange had a pink tucked into its hem and the air above the corn belonged to some other era, she parked her car at the edge of a field, turned off the engine, and sat in the silence that snaps everything back into itself. She got out and walked. There was a path beaten into the verge by no one in particular. A hawk hung in the acrylic sky. Five miles that way, people were watching something funny that would be unfunny in three months. Two miles that way, someone was being born. The ordinary world ripped and mended itself, as always. Then a shadow moved. Then a long arm reached out and pressed gently against a barn, as if the barn had said, my back hurts, and the hand had said, let me.\n\n\u201cYou keep expecting me to come to you,\u201d said Lynette, and Dr. M did not jump. \u201cYou keep expecting me to be where you think love will make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect to have to drive,\u201d said Dr. M, and her own voice felt like a jacket on a warm day. \u201cYou tell me where to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Lynette, and when she stepped close enough that the wind off her body made the trees nod, the love-intake sound in her chest was louder than it had been. So were the other sounds. The tinny radio down the hall had doubled. Names. Names, names, names, stitched inside the bigger drum. Daniel. Tai. May. Idris. Zo\u00eb. In the future there will be arguments about whether Dr. M heard those names. There will be people who insist she made them up because she was trying to give the giant a moral jawline. Believe what you can afford to.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop you,\u201d said Dr. M, because the older you get, the easier it is to say this. \u201cI can be with you while you do what you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a harder sentence than it looks,\u201d said Lynette, and if you had been there you would have cried a little and not known why. \u201cCome then,\u201d she said, holding out her hand, not as a lover does, not as a mother, as something else, something stranger and older, and Dr. M did not take it because the distance between a human hand and a giant hand is partly distance and partly the part of us that is still afraid of falling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk,\u201d said Dr. M, and Lynette nodded like a friend and began to move, and together they traced the field\u2019s edge, and behind them the corn whispered because it is a gossip, and ahead of them a town waited to see what it would believe.Dr. M learned the pace of her. The way a field length shrank under Lynette\u2019s stride and stretched under the human one. The way the giant paused for fences like a person pausing for a memory, lifting a foot the size of a family reunion and setting it down with all the apologies an elephant eucalyptus branch has ever made. The faint metallic clink of telephone wires greeting her shoulders when she misjudged and then, immediately, did not misjudge again. When you walk beside something that cannot convincingly pretend not to be myth, you start noticing human-scale myth, too. The low drawl of insects arguing the old arguments. The slumped tractor like a man who forgot his line. The tinny radio down Lynette\u2019s hall of a chest grew louder when they passed certain yards, as if certain houses knew their names better. In one yard a porch light burned and a woman sang badly to a baby who did not care about pitch. At that house, Lynette\u2019s intake hum warmed enough to tint the air around them. It was indecent to witness and ordinary to the point of boredom, a combination that made Dr. M feel as if she had been trusted with a sandwich she could not quite eat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an origin story,\u201d said Lynette, not looking at her, the way polite people face the road when they talk because talking is vulnerable enough. \u201cThey will make one for me. There will be a boy and a lake. There will be a lab. There will be a prayer that got big by accident. The truth is thin. I have always been here, in the sense that I am made of all your hurrying. If you want something you can pick up, pick up that.\u201d\n\nDr. M said, \u201cIf I write down no origin, they will say I omitted. If I write down five, they will say I am indecisive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will say you are a woman,\u201d said the giant, and the soft cruelty of it made both of them wince.\n\nIn class, the following week, she brought a passage from a nineteenth-century farmer who had written about a storm as if it had asked him for a dance, and the students groaned in unison at the adjective \u201cmaidenly\u201d because some things are easy to groan at. She wrote the word witness on the board and underlined it. She wrote the word archive and drew an unsteady box around it. The kid with the guitar calluses and the eyebrows so blue they might have been stamped onto his face by an impatient god squinted at the words like they were chess pieces he wasn\u2019t ready to move. A girl with the prettiest notebooks Dr. M had seen in a decade raised her hand and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t witness inherently violent? Because you are looking at something and you can\u2019t unlook.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Dr. M said, and her white chalk hand was dusted to the wrist like she had been digging in flour. \u201cSometimes it can also be the gentlest thing we do for each other. I see you is dangerous because it opens a door. It is also delicious. Who is allowed to say I see you in this town?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer,\u201d said someone from the back, lazy with the certainty that the only pronoun anyone needed now was the giant\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s doing it to kids who don\u2019t have a language yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cKids always have a language,\u201d said the bluebrowed boy, surprising himself. \u201cAdults don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nAfter class he hovered and didn\u2019t, then hovered again. He told her his mother had wanted to paint over his eyebrows with foundation and he had said, \u201cLet it be, Ma,\u201d and now he couldn\u2019t tell if he had said that because he believed it or because he wanted to see his own face in the mirror and feel brave. He said the boys on his block had turned their own brows into flags with eyeliner and he had laughed and then hated himself for laughing. He did not cry. He was the kind of earnest that makes teachers remember why they took the job even when the building leaked. She said, \u201cWill you talk to me on the record later?\u201d and he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t make me a lesson,\u201d and she said, \u201cI can try.\u201d\n\nThe city did a thing cities do when faced with a phenomenon that resists explanation: it made a committee. The committee met in the basement of the municipal building where the floor had been polished too often and still refused to shine. There was a long table with a jug of water that tasted like its own container. There was a man with shoulders like a backboard and a pin that read BUSINESS FORWARD. There was a woman who had done daycare for forty years and had opinions about everything except her own fatigue. There was a high school principal who introduced himself as Randy even though the placard said Randall T. Merson. There was a representative from Eppley Laboratories, which had flown a woman from St. Louis with a sleek ponytail and a voice that knew how to smile. She brought a prospectus and a promise of a solvent and a word the room wanted to be balm: reversal.\n\nDr. M sat near the end and took notes as if the words might run away if she didn\u2019t nail them to the page. She wrote, in the fat space of her notebook margin, you cannot reverse a conversation by wiping your mouth. The Eppley woman said, \u201cWe are exploring a topical application that will safely deactivate the chromophores in the dye compound. We have a memorandum of understanding with the Attorney General about fast-tracking approval,\u201d and the daycare woman said, \u201cI don\u2019t care about your chromophobes\u2014\u201d and the principal said, \u201cChromophores, Mags,\u201d and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t care, either way,\u201d and the Eppley woman nodded the way women nod when men in the room are watching to see if they can deal with a tone.\n\nFrom the back came a cough like a dissent clearing its throat. Albert M., sanitation worker, hat in his hands the way a hat belongs in hands when a man comes underground, stood and did not fit into the expectation the room had laid out for how he would speak. He did not speak immediately. He looked at the jug, looked at the prospectus, looked at the sign above the door that said NO SMOKING as if it had nothing to do with him, and then said, \u201cI saw the hand.\u201d A pause. \u201cOn the dumpster.\u201d He might have been saying I saw my own life today for the first time like a map. The room rotated his sentence from angle to angle as if trying to see if the light caught. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing this big is a joke.\u201d He sat down and the Eppley woman smiled and said, \u201cExactly,\u201d which was not what he meant.\n\nLater, in the parking lot where the committee had to go back to being a parking lot, Albert held his hat low over his eyes and told Dr. M, \u201cI didn\u2019t look up for twenty-two years. I was proud of it. Felt like I was resisting a thing. I ain\u2019t sure what. When I saw her print, I thought, oh, so that\u2019s where the sky\u2019s been. Up there. Forgot it was even up.\u201d His fingers worried the brim of his hat as if it had disobeyed him and needed to be taught. \u201cI ain\u2019t got kids,\u201d he said and then, as if hearing himself say it for the first time, \u201cI ain\u2019t got kids,\u201d and looked across the lot at a girl with blue eyebrows laughing with her whole body. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right for the lab to come in and scrub a town so it looks good on paper. Sometimes a mess is a record.\u201d\n\nThe Eppley woman put a pop-up booth at the farmers\u2019 market anyway. She had the sense to leave the corporate logo off the banner and hired a local kid with soft hands to hand out pamphlets that said CHOICE in font that tried too hard. On the second Saturday she set a sample on the table\u2014a tiny jar with something so clear inside it looked like it had eaten transparency for breakfast\u2014and asked passersby to dab a dot on the pamphlet to see how it interacted with the blue dot printed there. The dot lightened, obedient as a schoolchild. A woman whose child had a unibrow so enviable everyone in line flirted with it reached a finger toward the jar and then did not touch it. Her face did the math of all the ways her kids had been saved by things she had said no to. The jar caught the sunlight and made a clean, cheap halo that a photographer would have killed for. Lynette did not come to the market. You felt, anyway, the way some people feel when they decide, privately, not to go to a party because attending would make the party about them.\n\nWhen the town hall came, it was not the one in the municipal basement; it was the kind where anyone with a grievance and a throat could be a bell. It was at the high school gym under that big mural nobody could agree about, a Native man painted so nobly you couldn\u2019t decide if he was a person or a symbol. The bleachers gave and groaned under bodies. The sound system popped and then pretended to be adequate. In the bathroom a sign over the sink told cheerleaders the correct length of their nails. Stacked under the basketball hoop were the folded chairs from the last time the town had needed someplace to sit and have feelings. Dr. M sat three rows up with Farouq, the paper of his program crinkling as if he were trying to fold it into something else. The sheriff, who had the kind of forearms that make you want to confess that you had once pocketed a grape at the grocery store, stood with a microphone and said the kinds of sentences men like to say in rooms like this, sentences that contained assess and ongoing and partnership.\n\n\u201cWe have contacted the Governor\u2019s office,\u201d said a council member with a face the exact color of fresh radishes. \u201cWe\u2019re convening a working group.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need action, not working groups,\u201d yelled a voice and five voices murmured, yes, but no one leapt to their feet. A boy with blue eyebrows and a varsity jacket had scrawled over the Eppley pamphlet in his lap: do not fix me. A woman with her hair in a scarf stood up in the aisle and said, \u201cCan you mark my husband? He doesn\u2019t see nobody unless they yell, and I am tired of yelling.\u201d Some people laughed and some people did not because they had been women with the exact same mouth.\n\nThe sheriff took it like a man takes a pie in a movie, which is to say he accepted it as part of the performance. \u201cWe will not allow vigilantism,\u201d he said, which was, everyone felt, not quite the right word. A rumor had already begun before his sentence ended that someone had seen the giant near the water tower again. A rumor had taken its shoes off and was rubbing its feet and was in no hurry. Dr. M felt the pressure change. You know that pressure change. The way the day seems to pull its sleeves down. The way your lungs consult with one another about whether now is a good time to learn to be gills.\n\nShe did not appear in full. She slid into the space where the gym ends and the sky begins, like breath under a door. A child pointed. The sheriff dropped the microphone and it made a noise like a pet you have accidentally stepped on, brief and pitying. The slow blue of the sky was a conspiracy of noncommittal. The splurge gun lifted. It did not point at teenagers. It did not point at children. It did not, notably, point at the Eppley booth slinking in from the side like a shy idea. It pointed at the banner above the stage where five words had been printed so large your own retinas were forced to absorb them: UNITY IS OUR STRENGTH. The arc cut the U and the N in two and ran down the Y like a tear. The banner wore its mark like a sash at a pageant. The collective inhale was not belief; it was recognition. On the floor, the dye trickled in old lines, found the cracks in the gym varnish and settled like a lesson. The sheriff bent, and when he stood, there was a thin blue signature on his fingers that would not wash off no matter how many towels he mangled in the locker room later. He put his hand to his forehead without meaning to, a practice salute. It left a smudge right where a saint\u2019s thumb would go.\n\nAfter, the gym did the thing gyms do when they have been asked to hold something bigger than basketball. They hummed along pretending they had always known how. The janitor\u2014a woman with keys that could open every sadness in that building and never did\u2014mopped and mopped and could not lift the blue out of the wood. She looked at the new river in the court and said, \u201cOkay,\u201d to it. Dr. M went home with the tiredness that has nothing to do with muscles and everything to do with watching your town learn a new trick.\n\nShe dreamed a whole story for Lynette that she promised, upon waking, she would never write. In the story, the giant had been a teenager once after all, had been the kid who stayed late after school to staple flyers straight, had stood in the rain because someone else\u2019s bus was late, had let a boy kiss her because he asked like a human. In the story the boy went away and the love did not, and it built a scaffolding so tall she had to climb it and when she got up there the air was thin and she saw the whole stupid beautiful town and wanted to sit in their hair like a flower no one could pull out. It was a junk story and she loved it fiercely the way you love a baby that hasn\u2019t learned its own hands. She got up and made coffee with one hand and with the other wrote: do not save her with a boy. She underlined it so hard the page bruised.\n\nPilar showed up at her office with a pack of Gushers and a request. She stood in the doorway like a bookmark and said, \u201cCan you teach me to collect?\u201d She meant like Dr. M collected rumors and with the word collect made it sound like a tender theft. Dr. M handed her a legal pad and said, \u201cStart by writing down what you think you know and put a box around what you actually saw,\u201d and Pilar did, tongue out at the corner of her mouth, determining the width of her own certainty. She wrote: she said hi. She wrote: she smells like candy, which Dr. M corrected to: she smells like the idea of candy. Pilar rolled her eyes because kids have no patience for the adult impulse to italicize everything. \u201cMy eyebrows aren\u2019t blue,\u201d Pilar said, apropos, peeling a Gusher and splitting it neatly along its seam. \u201cBut sometimes when I look in the mirror my skin looks more like a map than a face. Do you think that\u2019s what she wants?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she wants what we want,\u201d said Dr. M. \u201cTo walk into a room and not think, what do I owe this space to be allowed in it. To walk in and think, the space owes me a chair.\u201d Pilar looked at her like she had been handed a riddle in a language she almost spoke. She put the legal pad in her backpack like a fragile thing.\n\nFarouq put together a show. He called it Browbeat because puns are a way to pretend a gun isn\u2019t on the table. He rented the back room of a bar that had last hosted a jazz trio that had pretended to know one another. He invited three kids he knew and two he didn\u2019t and a woman who had been marked at forty-nine\u2014no one had seen her splurged, but her brows carried the blue like someone had painted a line on the street and then the town had had to follow it. He stood in the doorway and took five dollars and put them in a cigar box someone had once loved, and he told Dr. M, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a fundraiser, but I don\u2019t know how to do something completely for free yet.\u201d The woman with the forty-nine-year-old eyebrows got up and said into the old microphone, \u201cI am married to a dentist who eats frosting at night with a spoon, and he cried when he saw me blue, and I don\u2019t know if he cried because he saw me or because he thought he had failed to keep everything neat.\u201d The kids nodded as if she had been reading them bedtime. A boy with a shaved head and the most delicate eyelashes stood and said, \u201cEveryone keeps saying it\u2019s about being seen and, like, okay, but can I talk about how it also makes me feel like a stop sign? Like love is a car and sometimes it runs the sign and I die.\u201d There was a silence afterward that was not awkward. It was weight-bearing. It could have been a floor.\n\nThe next morning a man in a bunny mask put a stamp on the water tower itself, a blue rabbit ear floating just below the crown. Nobody knows how he got up there. He might have flown. He might have dated a girl whose father owned a bucket truck. It was a year of hacks, of recycled courage, of knowing your way around a lock. The cops laughed and pretended they didn\u2019t and said, \u201cVandalism,\u201d and half the town thought, what isn\u2019t.\n\nA letter came in the same cartoon-cat stationary, the cats wearing sunglasses this time as if someone at the campus bookstore believed in novelty. It had been slipped again into her campus box, disrespecting the whole process of postage because what is postage but the trusting of your words to a system? She unfolded it on the bus and read it while a man across the aisle practiced his frown and a girl in a track jacket slept with her mouth open. YOU WILL CALL IT CONSENT, the letter said. YOU WILL ASK ME TO ASK. I AM ASKING ALREADY INSIDE THE AIR. IF YOU LISTEN YOU WILL HEAR THEM SAYING YES TO BEING ALIVE. The bus jolted and made a mistake at the light and the letter knocked against the window and the blue in one corner glinted the way oil does when it murders a puddle. She put it away. It itched in her pocket for a full block after she got off because the body knows when there is a heat-source near, even if the heat is stupid.\n\nNo one knew where Lynette slept. The rumor said corn. The rumor said the flat roof of the mall with its ancient JC Penney sign that refused to come down out of either faith or budget. The rumor said in the cooling towers of the power plant like a goddess inside a conch. The rumor said she did not sleep, which is the kind of cruelty we wish on saints. Dr. M began to notice the places where someone large might have leaned and those places were not always high. A ditch that had been compressed into a perfect curve. The crossbar of a swing set set ever so slightly out of true and kept that way, as if a hand had said: this is where it hangs now. Her map on the wall grew thread like a sweater at a party that has a dog.\n\n\u201cLet me mark you,\u201d she said again one evening with her window open so wide the insects were voting on whether to be her roommates. \u201cIf it matters to you that I believe you are trying, then mark me.\u201d She did not turn it into a dare. She tried to turn it into an offering. She woke to the feeling of weight near her head and did not scream because some things are the kinds of gifts you take in without frightening the giver. On the pillow beside her, pressed in the hollow where a head would be if myth slept like a person, a perfect blue handprint darkened the pillowcase. The hand was not grotesque. It was human-hand-sized. It was hers. She put her palm over it and matched. She changed the pillowcase and the print stayed on the fabric; it would not wash out. She changed the sheets entirely and when she took the pillow to the laundromat, the attendant who\u2019d dyed her hair the color of a traffic cone admired it like a tie-dye that had finally got it right. She thought of sleeping on her own hand, of suffocating on the effort it takes to become. She slept without the pillow and woke with a sore neck. There are sacrifices and there are inconveniences and sometimes they are the same thing at different magnification.\n\nThe Eppley solvent made its way into two bathrooms. A boy with a mother who bought anything a woman in a lab coat told her to buy dabbed it on his left brow and not his right because he had carried fairness too far in every game he had ever played. The left paled, the right held. He went to school and someone said, \u201cYou look like a glitch,\u201d and he wanted to go home and lie still until he could no longer be called by a name. He did not. He stayed. He watched the teachers not watch him. He went to the bathroom during fourth period and wrote the word stay on a paper towel and tucked it in his pocket. Later, when he kissed a boy under the bleachers, the boy touched the right brow and then the left and then said, \u201cI like the one that stayed and the one that tried to go,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t poetry but it was worse; it was the truth, in teenage grammar, and that\u2019s better.\n\nA mother named Judith\u2014yes, the same Judith who refuses to sit down as often as breath allows\u2014started the stencil project. She cut out eyebrows from cardboard, big ones, too expressive by half, and spray-painted them blue on the sidewalks leading to the high school. Along one block the eyebrows looked curious. On the next block they were furious. On the last block they were so tired you wanted to scoop them up and carry them. A grumpy man with a leaf blower tried to harry the blue out of the concrete and the dye did its patient thing: it held. It held like a friend\u2019s hand holds you when everyone else is pretending they don\u2019t know your last name.\n\nThe letters stopped for a week and then returned on graph paper. The letters did not know what they wanted to be when they grew up. YOU WANT A PAST, this one said. I HAVE A HUNGER. IT IS NOT MY FAULT YOU CALL HUNGER A HISTORY WHEN IT STICKS AROUND THIS LONG. Dr. M laughed aloud at that and then put her hand over her mouth because she had read the sentence in the rare book room and the librarian, who wore her hair like an accusation, did not like laughter anywhere near vellum. She folded the letter up along graph\u2019s implied lines and it folded so neatly it felt like magic, and then unfolded it and the creases had become part of what the letter meant. She wrote in her notebook: she did not ask to be your invention. She wrote: admit that love is not gentle. She wrote: stop apologizing for sentences that use the word love. She drew a tiny flag beside that and put a circle around the flag and wrote: incitement to tenderness.\n\nIt was Farouq who saw it first: adults. It started at a bank drive-through where a manager who had never once said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d to a customer walked into work with a blue crown over his eyes that made his staff stare and then look away and then have to look back because you cannot not look at the proof that someone has been touched. Then a third-grade teacher whose students refused to make wish lists because they were superstitious about asking got marked on a day she had red lipstick on and she kept the lipstick on because sometimes doubling down is also grace. Then the host of the morning show who had used the word epidemic with a little thrill in her throat found her own eyebrows complimenting her brand-new blazer like a prank her mother would have laughed at. The teenagers stopped feeling like a target and started feeling like a contagion kids would gladly give to the adults if only it could pass by touch. Teachers told them not to rub their faces against their elders and the kids did not but they wanted to because giving adulthood something you have and they don\u2019t is a pleasure as pure as rain after heat.\n\n\u201cIs this what you meant?\u201d Dr. M asked Lynette in a field behind a self-storage facility where the rows of corrugated doors looked like a painting of itself. The giant had a dime on her palm. It was not a giant dime. It was a dime. She had found it in a parking lot and had not yet given it back to the world. \u201cSharing,\u201d Dr. M said, and watched the intake hum swell when a couple in a Subaru in the lot over began to kiss as if they had not kissed in years, which perhaps they had not.\n\n\u201cIt is what I am allowed,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cI would pluck out the need to be cruel in all your bosses if I could. I am, alas, not a surgeon.\u201d She flicked the dime and it pinged a perfect note against the storage unit door and fell, and Dr. M had the childish urge to say, do it again, a greed she suppressed in favor of looking, again, at this nice woman who insists on being enormous.\n\n\u201cYou changed your mind,\u201d Dr. M said, because people like narratives that pivot, because it gives their own pivots permission.\n\n\u201cI did not,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cThe town widened. I am not a pivot; I am a measure.\u201d She looked at the self-storage units and her face did a thing like regret. \u201cLook what you keep. Look what you are willing to pay to pretend you will need again.\u201d\n\nThe county fair came as it always does, dragging with it the scent of fried participation. The ferris wheel went up and made its usual promises to couples who needed a height to make the dizziness feel chosen. The kids lined for the Gravitron and argued about who, among them, had the heart kind of strong that lets you taste metal without vomiting. The fair has always been a place where a town wears its poverty in sequins. It is honorable, this insistence on twinkle. Dr. M walked the midway with Farouq and let him talk about the girl who had laughed last week at something he had said and how he had laughed too and how he would rather be the kind of person who says, I like you, than the kind who plans thirty responses to a hypothetical text. She bought a funnel cake and let the sugar whitewash the part of her brain that kept records of everything that might go wrong. The 4-H kids showed pigs who had learned to be gods for two days and then, later, not; the kids loved them perfectly anyway. At the kissing booth, someone had hung a sign in careful cursive: NO EYEBROW DISCOUNTS. Somebody had crossed it out and written: YES EYEBROW DISCOUNTS. Under both, in an accel pen that bled through the paper: KISS EVERYBODY YOU CAN.\n\nWhen the blue came that night at the fair, it arced over the ferris wheel and caught the top of a gondola where a woman about sixty sat with a boy too old to be hers. He put his hand on hers and pretended he was the one comforting. The blue caught the edge of the tilt-a-whirl operator\u2019s forehead; he laughed and shook his head and did not pause the ride because some things cannot be paused once you\u2019ve said yes to them. It slid down the silver side of the corn dog stand and made the metal look baptized. It dripped and did not drip. At the same instant the main stage lights snapped, as if obeying more interesting electricity, and the band\u2014a good cover band, too earnest by half\u2014fell quiet without rancor. The giant reached in and lifted a string of paper lanterns that had been strung low and would have caught on her wrist. She moved them up, gently, like adjusting a necklace on the throat of a friend. The murmurs in the crowd had the special sound of a whole town aligning their spines. Nobody ran. Running would have made it all smaller. The sheriff stood with his head bare and his fingers still faintly blue and gave back the hat he\u2019d been handed because sometimes you do not deserve to cover yourself.\n\nLater that night, in a motel near the interstate where the carpet was a geography no one wanted to plot, a man came to the desk and asked for blue-out in a tone that suggested he was doing the clerk a favor by including him in his problem. The clerk, who had a mother who would not forgive him until he forgave himself, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t carry absolution,\u201d and then, because he liked his job, said, \u201cTry Eppley. They\u2019re at the farmer\u2019s market between the honey and the jars of second chances.\u201d The man left, and the clerk made a small chalk line on the back of the desk and felt calmer. He pretended, briefly, to be keeping score and then put the chalk down and decided, bravely, not to.\n\nDr. M sat with her map and moved a pin from Savoy to a farm road whose name she\u2019d driven a dozen times and never read. She wrote: the fair is a church where you can wear shorts. She wrote: she adjusted the string of lanterns. She wrote: she knows the height of us better than we do. She let herself put her head down on her desk, the way you are not supposed to because it will make you want to sleep and you have marked sleep for later. When she lifted her face, there was a faint blue half-moon on her cheek from where, somehow, somewhere, there had been a small, irresponsible smear of dye on her own notebook. She went to the bathroom and looked at her face and saw not punishment but punctuation. In the morning, it was gone. That did not mean it had not been there.\n\nThe Eppley woman left town and did not leave town. She left her jar and her pamphlets and her precise hair in the hands of a local pharmacist who had made her name giving people the wrong things for the right reasons. The jokes softened because they always do. The first boy to get married with blue eyebrows in the wedding photos cried when he saw himself in the proofs and said, to his husband and to the photographer and to the dumb white cake, \u201cI am here, fuck,\u201d and it was the most religious sentence spoken in his family in three generations. An old man with eyebrows like a mold breaking spoke to his church and said, \u201cY\u2019all thought God was going to be loud. Maybe he is bright instead,\u201d and half the church agreed and half muttered and all of them brought casseroles with noodles that took on holiness by association. A hair salon offered eyebrow styling for the unstyleable, and teenagers sat in chairs and watched the women make something ceremonial out of something imposed. No one had found a remover that did more than bruise.\n\nFrom a hill no one else called a hill\u2014because midwesterners are stingy with topography\u2014Lynette watched a thunderhead become a city. Her head tilted the way her head tilted when she was listening to a voice that had not said its name out loud yet. She looked like what we make of angels when no one is watching us make them. Dr. M drove up and parked in the place her car had learned not to roll and did not honk or wave because you don\u2019t call to the sky. She got out and stood beside the large ankle, which had a smudge of dust and one, green leaf stuck to it like a sticker put there by a child trying out an idea of ownership. She did not touch, not because she feared to, but because she is good at boundaries, sometimes to the attention-starved sadness of her own day. The air was heavy and felt like it had eaten something corrupting. The tinny radio in Lynette\u2019s chest was loud and full of names that were also places; you, you, you, Urbana, you, Prospect, you, third-floor apartment with the crying radiator.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d Lynette asked, and this time it was a question that asked for an answer instead of a confession.\n\n\u201cI want you to do what you can bear living with later,\u201d said Dr. M, which was the worst and best thing she could have said. \u201cI want you to consider marking the places and not just the faces.\u201d She surprised herself with the rhyme and tried not to show that surprise to the giant because it felt like a bird that would fly away if named.\n\n\u201cWhat place do you want me to mark so your city cannot say it did not happen?\u201d asked the giant, her hands empty of instruments, which is when the worst and best things happen.\n\nDr. M thought of the courthouse steps. She thought of the mosque. She thought of the high school stage where they had performed A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in jeans and a single evergreen tree borrowed from Christmas. She thought of her own apartment door. She said, \u201cThe jail.\u201d\n\nLynette nodded like a person who had also thought of the jail. When she moved in that direction, you could feel the ground not shake but affirm. The thunderhead did a theatrical thing because sometimes it is a gift to the town when the weather cooperates. They walked as if they had a chaperone, as if the air were a parent who did not approve of this friendship and could be convinced. The jail was uglier up close. Buildings built to hold sorrow on purpose always are. The parking lot light flickered with the pathos of fluorescent. Inside, a woman whose job it was to catalog the human body into the system\u2019s stomach paged through a book and underlined the part about \u201cidentifying marks\u201d and thought about whether she had any at all. The sheriff\u2019s blue-fingered hand reached for the switch he had meant to fix for months and then an inch of blue found the gray slab of the building and wrote, neatly, on the concrete near the door, not a symbol, not a name, but the word: HELD.\n\nThe paint did not bleed. It did not drip. It sat there like a thesis. Staff stood, later, and read it and pretended they hadn\u2019t. Men inside felt something cold and then something warm and then nothing because many of them had learned not to feel until it would not embarrass them. The word did not absolve. It did not accuse. It said, you are, which is different from the weeping I love you that songs teach. It said, you are, and the city had to count that as data.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Dr. M, because sometimes gratitude is a leash and sometimes it is a ladder and she could not tell yet which this would be.\n\n\u201cDo not thank a storm for rain,\u201d said Lynette, but her mouth had softened and the names in her chest were louder and somewhere someone decided not to die that night and someone else decided to fall in love with someone who would not hurt them and neither will become statistics. They will become the stories you tell on porches when you are feeling brave about how you have survived yourself.\n\nIt would have been narratively satisfying if, here, someone had decided to climb a water tower with a sniper rifle and end a metaphor. Nobody did. It would have been narratively satisfying for Eppley to release a solvent that stripped blue and a layer of skin with it, and for the town to have a lesson about what you are willing to take off to look like the picture in your head. The solvent made some teenagers itchy and one adult nauseous and then stopped being a trend. It would have been narratively satisfying for Dr. M to kiss someone in a parking lot and be marked mid-kiss and laugh and let the laugh live. She did not kiss anyone. She went home and cooked a pot of beans and read a novel about a woman who could hear the dead humming in the pipes like radiator ghosts and went to bed at an hour that would have made her a better person if she\u2019d been the kind of person who believed hours held moral weight.\n\nAt two, a car alarm yelled not about crime but about loneliness. At three, the radiator coughed its small cough. At four, the letters in her brain lined up and asked to be let into sentences. She let some of them. She left some out. She wrote: chapter three is not the one where we learn how to stop loving. She wrote, in a softer hand: I am trying to work out who the villain is and I keep drawing arrows back to the mirror. She wrote, tucked near the edge of the page where the spiral binding nipped at her wrist, small and honest and mean to only herself: I am good at watching. That will not be enough, soon.\n\nOutside, the town made the laugh that fair rides make when they are taken down and packed into trucks. Outside, a postman on a bike thought of the time he had wanted to leave and had not and wondered whether the wanting or the staying had altered him more. Outside, the water tower\u2019s new stripe faded one shade in order to become more itself. Outside, a giant lay down in a place we can argue about and listened to the names in her chest like a mother listens to a baby who does not cry in order to be loved. Inside, a woman put her hand over the place her heart had learned to thud on schedule, and waited for morning to tell her what to do.Chapter Five\n\nThe morning after HELD arrived on the jail, the word hovered in Dr. M\u2019s mouth like a lozenge she couldn\u2019t quite dissolve. Held: the way a hand cups a face when both people are almost brave, the way a jar keeps peaches that were once heat and tree, the way a cell remembers the shape of a body even after it is vacuumed and bleached. In her class she wrote H E L D in chalk block letters that felt childish and not, and underneath, without flourish, she wrote the synonyms the town would not reach for first: carried, kept, cradled, detained. The students eyed the list as if looking for a trap they could all leap over together. The boy with the guitar fingerpads, blue at the brows and trying not to be a sermon, said, \u201cIt\u2019s like the word won a fight,\u201d and a girl in the corner whose eyebrows were ordinary but who had carved blue moons into her sneakers with a pen nodded as if she had thought the same but had been unwilling to be first. Outside, a maintenance crew used a power washer on the courthouse steps and the water spread in a fan and then fell back, obedient to gravity and to the limits of their hose.\n\nShe avoided the jail on purpose for a day because a word like that deserves at least twenty-four hours of not being viewed through glass. It needs to sink, to find the pipes in a building and lie down along them like a length of blue vein. She walked instead to the farmer\u2019s market and stood at the end of the Eppley table where the jar sat like a sermon with a visible endpoint. There was a stack of pamphlets that had learned the town and now had creases where the same hand had handled them every Saturday. The pharmacist, who had been deputized into the role of cosmetic savior and was slightly regretting the paperwork part, smiled at her with a professional\u2019s calm and said, \u201cGood morning, Doctor,\u201d as if good could be an agreement. A boy of nine with eyebrows too fine to hold anything permanent stood on tiptoe and breathed on the jar until his mother told him to leave science alone. Farther down the row, a woman already blue at the brows bought honey from a man who called her ma\u2019am and meant it like a compliment; the honey caught light and made a gold you could argue with and never win.\n\nAt the Eppley booth a sign had sprouted in a practised hand: ASK ABOUT CONSENT. The word was becoming a currency. People moved it around, spent it on arguments, saved it for later. \u201cWe offer free consultations,\u201d said the pharmacist in a tone that tried to be lotion and almost made it. \u201cNo obligation. We want everyone to feel empowered.\u201d Empowered is a word like laminate; it sticks to whatever you press it on and gives off a smooth shine. Dr. M said, \u201cAnd if the blue, say, wasn\u2019t something that happened to them but something they are glad to have happen?\u201d The pharmacist looked at the jar again, as if she might find an answer at the bottom like tea leaves that had been poured wrong. \u201cChoice is still choice,\u201d she said, and meant it, and somewhere a teenager whose nails were bitten down to the quick decided not to show up for their appointment to try the solvent, and somewhere else a different teenager went in and did, and breathed through the sting that came up as lightly as embarrassment.\n\nThe city did not sleep through the Inauguration of the Word. People took pictures of HELD and made it their profile pictures. An old woman whose husband had died on a wet night when a truck did not hit the brakes touched the letters with her ungloved fingers and then touched her own forehead as if words were contagious in that direction too. A man in a tie wrote an email to the council with subject line BLUEBROW VANDALISM and attached two photographs: one of the jail\u2019s new signage, one of his teenage son sipping coffee and looking at the world like it was cracking open just enough to let some air in. He did not see that he had sent his heart along with his argument. Someone in the comments wrote: it\u2019s paint. Someone wrote: it\u2019s not paint if it\u2019s a petition. It turns out you can fight with nouns and no one bleeds for hours.\n\nLynette moved the way she always moved, with so much attention the attention itself made you ache. She did small things no one was keeping a ledger for. She lifted a telephone wire that had sagged dangerously across a back alley so that the truck someone had borrowed from someone\u2019s cousin could pass without losing its curl of lights. She shifted a branch that had thought about breaking in last night\u2019s wind and then decided not to because the morning looked like it could use a good tree. She pressed her hand, later, against the brick lip of a school where children come to be sorted into palatable shapes, and the brick did not soften but the air did. The intake in her chest did not waver, exactly, but it found a new rhythm, fast and then measured, as if getting used to a song a town had just learned to hum together.\n\nIn her office, under the faux-wood bulletin board where announcements for readings and workshops were tacked in layers like sedimentary rock, Dr. M found a note stuck into the corner of a poem about cows that had been weathering badly since spring. The paper had been ripped from a composition notebook; the tear was jagged in the way only spines left too long in a backpack can produce. The handwriting slanted one way and then the other, a person practicing being decisive. It read: MY BOYFRIEND DOESN\u2019T HAVE EYEBROWS BECAUSE HE SHAVED THEM IN EIGHTH GRADE AND THEY NEVER REALLY CAME BACK AND HE FEELS INVISIBLE AT THE GROCERY STORE AND VISIBLE AT THE PARTY. IS HE LESS CHOSEN. IS HE LESS. Dr. M put the note under a magnet shaped like an orange slice and answered in the next class in the only way she could without lying: \u201cThe blue can\u2019t decide whether you are chosen. That isn\u2019t its job. Your body is not a ballot box. You can stop voting.\u201d\n\nIn public, Dr. M began to be approached as if she had been deputized to hold the giant\u2019s purse. A man with a daughter and a tight jaw asked if she could tell the giant to move out beyond the corn and splurge the sky so it would rain. A girl who needed to spit and couldn\u2019t brought her spitless mouth and said, \u201cMake her write my grandmother\u2019s name somewhere.\u201d A city councilman, who had learned to say which side of his mouth to speak out of depending on who was clapping, emailed to ask if she would serve on the Subcommittee for Community Recovery from Affection-Based Incidents. She replied with a sentence that had the word deflect in it and went back to arranging sentences in a way that felt like keeping sparrows from bumping into windows.\n\nFarouq, whose body had found a gear between young and not, texted her at midnight a photo of the water tower with a new line like a heartbeat halfway up. Under it he wrote: she\u2019s measuring herself, or us? Dr. M wrote back: both, probably, and he responded with a string of hearts he would have called corny last year and now wore like a jacket he could not believe fit. He held another Browbeat and this time a boy whose foster placement had lasted four weekends stood and said into the microphone, \u201cIf I had had blue when I was little, maybe someone would have fought for me with, like, teeth,\u201d and people shifted on their chairs and then someone finally clapped because the silence was too heavy not to break. A woman with hair the color of arguments read a piece about how her daughter\u2019s blue had made her mother nice for exactly two days and then the nice had burned off like fog and left what it had always been in place. \u201cWe take the blue personally,\u201d the woman said into the mic, \u201cbut maybe this is a municipal project and not a therapy dog,\u201d and Dr. M wrote that down because it was too good and too true and too cruel not to keep.\n\nThere were other, smaller, hymnals to the blue. Someone painted eyebrows on pumpkins and set them in a row on a porch and the cat knocked them all down in one vindictive swipe. A high school art teacher, newly marked at the temple like a blessing someone had missed by an inch, put a bin of blue pencils by her classroom door with a sign that said: USE THESE FOR YOURSELF ONLY. They disappeared and returned like tide. A kid on a school bus practiced the math of looking out the window and not at the boys whose faces had become flags, and finally turned and said, \u201cYou look like superheroes, kind of,\u201d and the boy with the best blue scowled and said, \u201cWe\u2019re tired of being metaphors. We still have to do algebra.\u201d It was a living, this town; it was doing it.\n\nShe went to the jail because you cannot write HELD down twice and call yourself thorough. The building looked worse the closer she got, as buildings whose job includes sorrow often do. The blue at the door had dried to a matte she trusted; it had lost the swagger of something newly applied and settled into its slow vocation. A man in a uniform watched her look; he had the kind of face that professions grow on you after time\u2014tired, obliging, strangely tender. She said, \u201cI teach at the university,\u201d and he said, \u201cThey told me people were going to come and stare,\u201d and then he shrugged, as if a stare could be a tithe a town pays and he could live with being collection plate. Through the glass of intake she watched a woman\u2019s hair be measured with a comb, saw the woman smirk at nothing and then pull her face back into seriousness like a drawstring. In the waiting room a child slept with her mouth open on a chair and her grandmother put a sweater over her like a moral. On the wall a poster urged anyone with an opioid habit to start now the work of finishing. Someone had taped an index card under it with three words and a phone number: I CAN HELP. She put her fingers against the H of HELD the way people in a museum put their fingers against the air in front of a painting when they forget themselves and wish to own it for half a second. The concrete took her body heat and gave nothing back.\n\n\u201cWhat are you writing?\u201d asked the uniformed man, not unkindly, like a father giving a kid an easy rope to tug a story all the way out with.\n\n\u201cI am trying to name the part of us that wants to fix signal so badly we make it worse,\u201d she said, and he laughed once through his nose because who hasn\u2019t tried to call a person back by texting them four times in a row. \u201cI am trying to write down the way a town learns to dress a wound without making it a landmark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a way with that,\u201d he said, and put his hand to his head as if checking his hat, as if it mattered that his blue smudge might still be there for his daughter to ask about at dinner. \u201cYou want to go in?\u201d he asked, and she shook her head. It was enough, that day, to stand outside and agree that words can hold people and let them go in the same afternoon.\n\nHer radiator held its breath and pretended to die for two minutes that night, then shuddered back to life with a sound like applause withheld. She lay down without undressing and put the pillow with the handprint under the bed because sometimes love is a glare in the dark and you need your eyes. At three she woke because the weather had come to collect on something it had promised in August. The thunder moved in the way older people dance: bold, amused, not in a hurry to impress. She watched the flashes turn her ceiling into a dictionary page and pretended she could read definition into the light. The rain began as if someone had finally said yes to a question it had been awkward to ask. The town sighed. The gutters did their work. Somewhere, a teenager who had shaved her eyebrows in defiance touched her own smooth face and felt, for the first time that week, plain and thrilled. Somewhere, a woman with blue brows kissed a man she would leave in a month and remembered that nothing you do under the sign of miracle will save you from the necessity of also doing mundane bravery.\n\nThe next day the rumor said that Lynette had been seen atop the mall, lying on her back with her hands behind her head, as if she had taken a day pass from being an omen. The rumor said she had laughed when she sneezed. The rumor said she had stroked the letter E on the JC Penney sign like a person touches a piano key they once played well. That evening, in the lot outside the Meijer that had its own weather and its own astrophysics because of how big the lights were, Dr. M stood with a shopping cart and tried to remember what she had come for. Milk. Coffee. A spray bottle for misting the plant that kept insisting on reaching toward a window that hadn\u2019t given it anything but stingy sun in months. She saw the Eppley woman pushing a cart with too much cereal in it, as if for a family or a cadre of interns. The woman\u2019s ponytail had slackened by one ambition. She recognized Dr. M without any natural pleasure and with the professional disappointment of an argument that refused a stage.\n\n\u201cYou were very effective at that meeting,\u201d the Eppley woman said, which is a thing people say when they mean, you took the attention I expected to leave with in my pocket.\n\n\u201cYou brought a solvent to a parade,\u201d said Dr. M, and then felt herself blush because she had meant it wittier than it was. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t stains.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut paint is paint,\u201d the woman said, and then, because both of them had been raised to nod at each other\u2019s competence even when disagreeing, she added, \u201cWe could study it together.\u201d Her eyes were not unkind. They glittered with the ferocity of someone who had chosen a life where they would have to be a salesman in every room, even their own bathroom mirror. \u201cIf we could take a sample from somewhere\u2014your pillow, say\u2014if we could figure out\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I have to let you in my room to prove my argument, then I\u2019ve already lost,\u201d said Dr. M, and watched the woman pretend not to have heard the intimacy of the word room. \u201cBesides, she asked me not to turn her into a villain. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d like to be turned into a reagent either.\u201d\n\n\u201cVillains sell,\u201d the Eppley woman said in a tone that was half caution, half envy. \u201cSo do cures.\u201d\n\nThey parted near the giant bins of bulk onions, each of them double-checking their list, each of them carrying something invisible in the basket under the cart. At the register a teenage boy with a pin that read TRAINEE said to Dr. M as he bagged, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s gonna be over soon?\u201d and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is a thing that ends,\u201d and he said, \u201cI want to go back to not thinking about my face,\u201d and she said, \u201cI think that might be one of the things you don\u2019t get to go back to,\u201d and he folded the bag as if it needed hiding.\n\nOn the day the Homecoming parade wound down Green Street with its usual combination of auditions and apology, people lined up with lawn chairs and coolers like a river that had agreed to go slow for the afternoon. Step teams practiced a last-minute clap. A float with an actual hay bale made liability lawyers steel themselves for letters later. The marching band wore hats that made them taller, which is what hats like that are for. The football team did their best not to look ridiculous on a wagon that had been decorated by the parent who had remembered to bring glitter. The girls on the court didn\u2019t wave like queens; they waved like girls who had practiced a wave and found it silly and were now doing it anyway because life is a rehearsal until it isn\u2019t. Dr. M stood halfway down the block in the shade of a tree that had figured out how to keep eleven leaves green in defiance of the season and beside her stood a man with a dog who had understood, through no fault of her own, that crowds might require her to be patient. The sky did a trick the sky does that people who don\u2019t live under it might think was magic. The clouds parted as if a hand had lifted a curtain to see who was down there making all that noise.\n\nThe first blue came not down but sideways, threading between buildings like a laugh shared between conspirators. It arced low and brushed the top of the tuba section and then climbed, evasive and flirtatious, toward the overhanging balcony where a group of seniors had set up a lookout with a bowl of pretzels and a single bottle of terrible champagne. It hung a second above the float that carried the homecoming court and two chaperones who had the exhausted eyes of people the town would not stop asking favors of. The girls closed their eyes out of instinct, and a boy put his hand up like a visor, and the blue skipped them and marked instead the horse\u2019s plume, which was ludicrous and perfect. The horse snorted and was less interested than anyone else. The sheriff stood on a corner with his hat in his hand and a woman from the PTA told him loudly that she knew a guy who could get the banner clean, and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave it there,\u201d and his voice contained a tired he had earned.\n\nThen something careless and ordinary happened a block away, as if to justify everyone\u2019s suspicion that doom is mundane. A car whose driver had tried to take a shortcut turned wrong and found the parade where the driver\u2019s plan had been. The car was not malicious. The car was a car. The driver lifted her hands away from the wheel for a second because she had been taught to regret before she had been taught to steer. The drumline turned the corner and for a heartbeat nobody was yet wrong and nobody was yet hurt. The blue came like breath before a word. It came foam-first, the ridiculous cousin of seriousness, a blossom and then a sheet, a drape like a new-ceilinged room, and it landed between car and kids and did the unscientific thing of stopping the world long enough to let it remember itself. The bumper hit foam and the foam said, no, sweetly and firmly. The drummers took three backward steps with the precision of people who practice moving their bodies together. A cymbal player let out a high laugh like something had been tickled inside his ribs. The driver put her forehead on her steering wheel and did not honk and then cried because she had come very close to becoming a person a town remembers angrily for longer than it should.\n\nA woman near Dr. M put her hand to her throat and touched her necklace like a line, as if making sure she was attached to her body. A kid, nine maybe, blue only in his mind, said, \u201cDid you see that,\u201d and by did you see that he meant, Did you see you are not always abandoned. Lynette\u2019s shadow tilted on the building in a way that made it seem she had leaned down from a place only birds use. She did not show herself in the theatrical way; she did what she had always done: managed the world around the edges so the edges would do less harm. The foam dissolved faster than anyone expected and left a taste in the air like a cheap candle that you love because it reminds you of an aunt who smelled like better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I would explain this in a memo,\u201d said a man behind Dr. M in a tie loosened to an acceptable degree for a Saturday. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d said his wife, who had been the kind of teen who never got elected to anything and is now the kind of adult who knows almost everything. \u201cYou bring cupcakes to the next meeting and you say we were lucky.\u201d The band moved on. The horse thumped his hooves in a rhythm that would have been a rhythm even without the drumline. The teenagers on the float leaned their heads together and tried to make a moment into a future and the moment, kindly, did not oblige.\n\nAfter, at the library where a program promised READ TO A DOG and meant it, children sat on carpet squares and practiced the art of placing their voices somewhere soft. A golden retriever of a temperament saints envy lay down with a sigh as if he had been doing things all day more difficult than staying in a warm place and being adored. A boy with newly blue brows held a book about a hungry caterpillar like a contract and read the way nine-year-olds do, breathless on the wrong words. The dog blinked and took in the boy. In the corner a librarian, who had been living lately on coffee and the ability to put her hair up with a pencil, closed her eyes for seven seconds the way people pray when they no longer know how to pray out loud. On the community board a flyer for the subcommittee had been pinned with three tacks that did not match, because cores of bureaucracy still kept the old injustice of mismatched supplies.\n\nShe did not sleep much anymore, or rather sleep came in and out like tide with a preference for the hours when human beings want to be otherwise. In the small hours she wrote a letter to Lynette she would not deliver. It said: I have been writing about you as if you are a metaphor because metaphors are the only giant thing I have tools for. It said: you are a person, and I do not know what moral obligations I owe a person who is also an event. It said: I am trying to tell the truth without making a weapon from your body. It said: I have loved stories to the point of hurting the thing being told. It said, smaller: I am tired of myself.\n\nIn the morning she went to the mosque with a scarf she did not know how to tie and someone helped her without making it a lesson. She sat on the women\u2019s side and watched people treat their bodies as tools and not as problems. The imam had a voice like good bread. He spoke about looking up and finding the sky exactly where it had always been and everyone understood what he meant without anyone saying her name. A toddler in tiny sweatpants escaped his mother\u2019s hand and walked toward the prayer row and a woman who was not his mother put two fingers gently on his shoulder and guided him back with a kindness that should have its own noun. As they put their shoes back on, a teenage girl with blue eyebrows and eyeliner with a wing sharp enough to cut a pose smiled at Dr. M like a person recognizes a regular they have never taken money from. \u201cShe was outside last night,\u201d the girl said, and meant the giant and not God. Her voice did not shake even though she had spent a year using it for less.\n\n\u201cDoes she make you feel seen?\u201d asked Dr. M, and the girl snorted, a delicacy. \u201cShe makes everybody feel like they know how tall they are,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cMy dad says he doesn\u2019t want to live in a town with a monster, and my mom says we already do,\u201d and then she put her headphones back on because two parents is a lot of weather.\n\nA week of rain gave the town shapes they had forgotten: puddles that reflected circles when someone threw a pebble, ditches that carried their water like contraband they would distribute later to lawns unworthy of saving. People forgot the smell of dust and remembered instead how clothing smells when it has been hung to dry in a kitchen. In that wet week, blue streaks appeared in places the giant could not have reached except by imagination: the undersides of footbridges, the lip of the bandstand in West Side Park, the rim of the fountain where someone had tied a ribbon for a cause no one could agree on. She was marking places. She was listening. She was reading the town\u2019s mind like a map and only writing on the parts everyone drove past without remorse.\n\nChildren started playing a game called Held. It involved one child standing with arms out and the others running at them as if to be stopped and the held child deciding, in a second, whether to say no and hold or turn and accept and be knocked down. There were rules that were never written and all of them had to do with the gentleness of falling. A boy with a haircut his mother did with her own hands stood up after a particularly well enacted held and said, \u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2019s doing,\u201d and another kid said, \u201cShe\u2019s not catching,\u201d and the first said, \u201cShe can\u2019t catch everything,\u201d and then they went in to wash their hands for dinner and it took twenty minutes because children always find a way to make water into a festival.\n\nThe Eppley solvent became another thing on a list people kept on the back of their minds: call dentist, pick up dry cleaning, decide whether to deactivate chromophores. Mothers formed factions without admitting it, the way people form bracket pools. There were Facebook groups with names like EYES UP and BLUE AND TRUE and LET KIDS CHOOSE. A woman whose political portfolio included rage and casseroles went door to door with a stack of consent forms that meant nothing and everything. \u201cDo you consent to being seen,\u201d she asked at one door, and the man said, \u201cI thought I did until now,\u201d and she laughed and took his signature anyway because people like her are the ones who keep a town moving from one story to the next without losing too many along the way.\n\nOn a Thursday afternoon that looked like any Thursday, a man who called himself a radio personality and who had kept the job because he knew when not to say what was in his mouth said into a mic: \u201cWe\u2019ve got Doctor Mariani with us today to talk about our very own big-hearted blue-browed bruha\u2014\u201d and then caught himself in time to not live on that sentence forever. She sat across from him and watched him reach for a joke and put it down with, for him, astonishing grace. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching this from the start,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching people watch it,\u201d and he leaned in as if that were the angle that mattered. \u201cWhat do we do now,\u201d he asked in the voice men have learned to use when they are ready to be forgiven, \u201cwhen the world is different from the one we arranged ourselves to live in?\u201d There was feedback in her headphones that made the question seem like it had asked itself twice. She could have said policy. She could have said prayer. She said, \u201cWe keep allowing the kids to tell us what hurts and what doesn\u2019t and believe them both,\u201d and the radio made the smallest noise a machine can make when it realizes it has accidentally done something holy.\n\nShe heard from a cousin she had not spoken to in eight years, a woman with two kids and a faith that had not bent when it might have been easier. The cousin wrote an email that began, I\u2019ve been following your giant, as if one could be genealogically connected to a phenomenon, and then told her a long, mild story about a girl in their town whose forehead had been marked with something she couldn\u2019t wash away, and how the town had turned that mark into a program with a budget and how the budget had saved exactly three people in one year and exactly no one the next and how sometimes what you can do is not a verdict on what you should. \u201cDo you have someone to eat dinner with,\u201d the cousin asked at the end, not as a trap, not as pity, just as a question, and Dr. M wrote back, I have a plant and a teenager who brings me Gushers, and the cousin wrote, that counts.\n\nThe rumor insisted on being relevant. It said: she was seen with her ear against the wall of the school like a doctor with a stethoscope to a barrel. It said: she put her finger to her mouth in a shh at a couple fighting in the parking lot of the diner so earnestly they stopped mid-syllable and then laughed at themselves until the laughter took over the fight\u2019s real estate. It said: she lay down in a field and covered her face with her hands like a child playing and the corn rustled as if covering her with a blanket. It said: she is tired. It said: she is not tired, she is charging. It said: she can\u2019t run out as long as we do not. People wrote that in places their friends would see and felt like they had done something about the weather.\n\nLate one evening, when the tomato plants in the community garden wore heavy fruits like secrets and the rabbits pretended they had not been involved, Dr. M met Lynette there because Pilar had said, \u201cShe likes the smell of the vines when they\u2019re green,\u201d and children know where gods prefer to stand. The giant crouched with her knees like folded scaffolding and watched a worm glimmer itself out of a patch of cracked dirt into soil that would be kinder. Her intake was busy; she sounded like a city at a distance. Dr. M did not bow, because naked awe had never been her style, but she stood straighter than usual. She felt her own posture the way a dancer must; it mattered in the presence of someone invented to make an angle out of air.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re marking the places,\u201d Dr. M said, and it was not a question, it was gratitude baked into a statement.\n\n\u201cI am letting the ground confess,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cYou had it all written down in your walking anyway. I am cleaning up your penmanship.\u201d She smiled and the tomatoes in the nearest cage seemed, for a second, to lean like small worshippers.\n\n\u201cWill you mark me,\u201d said Dr. M, as if ordering a drink slowly, syllable by syllable, to make sure she did not mispronounce the part that would turn the bartender either kind or cruel.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Lynette, and then, \u201cNo,\u201d and then, \u201cI have. I will. I won\u2019t. You are already.\u201d The giant lifted a thumb and pressed it gently against the inside of Dr. M\u2019s wrist, the skin that had held a thousand betrayals and a thousand small courtesies from strangers who had handed her change carefully. When she took her thumb away there was the faintest fog of blue, as if someone had breathed a color onto her. It did not last. It did not need to. Her heart struck her ribs like a child knocking to be let from a closet where they had gone to see what bravery felt like.\n\n\u201cEverybody keeps asking me to stop her,\u201d a man had told Dr. M at the hardware store that afternoon as he filled a paper bag with screws and a quiet hopelessness. \u201cI\u2019m a man who makes fences,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make fences that keep out tenderness.\u201d In the garden, she said to Lynette, \u201cYou are teaching us how to be held,\u201d and Lynette shook her head in that slow, stately way that made the gesture an essay. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are remembering.\u201d\n\nThe night wore down to its thinness. The garden\u2019s little flags on toothpicks, which had been pretending to matter all season, snapped in a small wind. Somewhere behind them a train complained its way across the town\u2019s spine. \u201cYou will not write me as a miracle,\u201d said the giant, and Dr. M heard the plea in it, the professional desire to be taken seriously even while being used by the gods. \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. M, and the word was a promise she felt like a weight. \u201cA manual, maybe,\u201d she said, and Lynette laughed and the tomatoes leaned again and Dr. M did not try to capture it with a camera because some things you cannot paragraph without killing.\n\nThe next day Pilar came by with her legal pad bent and thick with new ink. She had made columns: what I think, what I know, what I hope. In the first column she had written, adults need this more than us sometimes, and in the second, blue doesn\u2019t hurt, and in the third, that when I am older I will not forget how to look. She had drawn tiny eyebrows in the margin, all different moods. She put the pad on the table with a thump like a book reporting for duty. \u201cDo you want to come with me to the fair again tonight,\u201d she asked, casual in the way twelve-year-olds are when they are begging for companionship and pretending not to care. \u201cI want to watch the teenagers watch the teenagers,\u201d she said, and Dr. M understood the way a person understands the instructions for putting a dresser together even if none of the pieces quite look like the drawing.\n\nThey stood by the ferris wheel and watched the couples trust the machinery, watched the way hands find each other when bodies are suspended. A boy with eyebrows the color of a bruise in a place you can\u2019t show held the hand of a boy who would, in a week, tell him he was scared of the world and show it by not calling. A girl in a dress she had haggled out of a thrift store\u2019s back rack looked up and missed the kiss and then got it when the car came back down and did not die. The weather was so sure of itself the hair on people\u2019s arms lay flat. \u201cDo you think she gets tired of liking us,\u201d Pilar asked, voice small enough that it might have been a soup spoon. \u201cWe\u2019re not that easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she is practicing being a person,\u201d said Dr. M, both meaning it and not, \u201cand that is the longest job there is.\u201d The giant was not visible. The giant was a rumor that had decided to take the night off for the sake of everyone\u2019s blood pressure. The blue hung about wholesale as if reconsidering where it would look best in the morning. A little boy licked blue cotton candy and then looked at his fingers, and chose not to wipe them on his shirt, and his mother loved him so much in that second she had to sit down.\n\nAt home, later, the radiator did not cough. It breathed like a cat that has found the right spot on a blanket and will not move despite the existence of the universe. She stood in the tiny rectangle of her kitchen and considered the beans on the stove, the plant that had learned to accept what it was offered, the pillowcase she had folded and put on a top shelf the way people put their good jewelry. She took the pillowcase down. She held it up so the blue handprint was opposite her face and then she did the simplest good thing she had done in months: she took it back to bed and slept with her cheek on it as if sleeping on that particular past would make a better morning. The dream did not come. She woke without trembling and made coffee and did not sweeten it. She went to her desk before her email could ask for her and wrote, finally: Chapter Five. She wrote: We widen. She wrote: A town remembers. She wrote: A woman is a plural. She wrote: I am trying. Then she went out into a day that had decided, for once, to be straightforward. The sky wore its blue uncomplicated, the buses kept their schedules like stiff upper lips, and somewhere a giant lifted one more low wire that had been waiting to take the wrong head off.Chapter Seven\n\nBy the time the maples had given up and left their red where shoes could carry it inside, the word on the jail had become part of the directions people gave. Turn left at HELD, they said, as if love and detention could be a landmark the same way as the Dairy Queen. The students in Dr. M\u2019s classes began to date the semester by which public thing had turned blue last. A boy in a hoodie said mid-discussion, \u201cRemember before the bandstand?\u201d and someone else said, \u201cThat was like a week before the courthouse steps, I think,\u201d and they were wrong, and they were right in the way memory is right: it organizes itself into the order that wounds heal, not the order that calendars keep. The town\u2019s sentences had absorbed the nouns. The verbs were next.\n\nIt was in the rotunda at the Statehouse where the air smelled like grant money and old speeches that someone decided to make a hearing. The committee chairs wore ties their spouses had ironed like ultimatums. The folding chairs made a sound when they opened that brought school gyms to mind, which was a kind of humility even when nobody meant it. The Governor did not come. He sent a man with a jaw like a door who said words that fit into any afternoon, like bipartisan and framework, and the words floated up and got caught in the chandelier\u2019s complicated ribs. Dr. M sat three rows back with a spiral notebook whose curl had learned to make indents on her wrist. The Eppley woman spoke first, crisp as a celery heart, about chromophores and voluntary protocols and an opportunity for public-private partnership that made three men in the front row exhale like the word partnership had just paid last month\u2019s rent. A mother spoke who had painted her own eyebrows blue in solidarity and had discovered that her daughter did not want a twin so much as a witness; the mother said, \u201cI thought I was joining her boat but I was steering it without asking,\u201d and the room did not applaud because applause would have hurt the sentence.\n\nAlbert, hat in hand and nervous system honed by early mornings, cleared his throat and told them all about the hand on the dumpster as if that hand were the only brief he had brought. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t look up for twenty-two years and that\u2019s on me,\u201d and a man with a pen stopped clicking it because sometimes shame is contagious in a good way. He told them about the stripe on the silo and how his route now included it even though it never had before, how it had changed the time it took him to do his job not at all and his sense of what a job is completely. When he sat down, a woman with a bang of hair that suggested competence leaned forward and asked, gently, \u201cMr. M., do you support state action to remediate unauthorized markings on public infrastructure?\u201d and he said, \u201cI support learning to call a mark a memory,\u201d and the stenographer typed that like a person entering a foreign word they had been taught to respect.\n\nThey asked Dr. M up and she went because her body had learned that declining reshapes an afternoon and she did not have the kind of energy reshaping takes. She said into the microphone that kettled her voice, \u201cI teach how words become bodies when enough of us carry them,\u201d and saw the Eppley woman\u2019s mouth twist into an almost-smile that said: you know how to do this too. She spoke about witnesses and archives and the difference between reversing and repenting. She said, \u201cThe blue is not a bruise you can soothe with money,\u201d and the committee member with the creased tie winced in a way that made her want to say sorry and did not. When they asked if she knew where Lynette slept, she said, \u201cOf course,\u201d watching their eyes widen before she added, \u201cIn us,\u201d and the room made a simultaneous mistake with its mouth and almost laughed. She felt cruel for the instinct to make a joke halfway down the stairs of her seriousness and kinder for catching it by the collar and turning it into a point. After, in the echoing hall where interns practice looking purposeful, a young woman with a staff badge whispered, \u201cMy eyebrows never took it, but I still think of washing my face as telling her something,\u201d and Dr. M touched the girl\u2019s shoulder with three fingers the way strangers can when the rules loosen.\n\nIt was not all hearings and hymns to municipal process. At the high school, the art teacher with the mark at her temple curated an exhibit called Visible, hung in the cafeteria where curry and chlorine had seeped into the walls as if smell could be paint. Kids made self-portraits that refused the name selfie and used as much blue as the supply closet could offer. A boy who had been, all his life, told to make himself small so other people could fit, drew his face too big for the paper on purpose, the brows a horizon line he dared you to misinterpret. A girl whose blue had faded in the dry heat of the school\u2019s winter vents made a collage in which her eyebrows were two small rivers feeding one larger river and taped beneath it, in block letters that had kissed a ruler: I AM HOT AND COLD AT ONCE. At parent night a woman paused in front of a piece in which the only blue was a postage-stamp-sized square in the middle of a forehead, and she said something to her son about minimalism in the tones she used when she did not want to admit to complicated feelings, and he shrugged in the dialect of sixteen and walked on.\n\nWhen the first frost finally took the crabgrass\u2019 arrogance, the blue did a trick science could not publish without inviting ridicule. In the crisp, the brows went faint, as if asleep, and in kitchens where kettles hissed and bathrooms where showers fogged mirrors, they darkened again, reasserting, like ink reappearing under lemon heat. An entire thread appeared on the town subreddit about humidity and dye bonds and someone wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s like kindness, it goes farther when the air lets it,\u201d and immediately deleted it because they had been sincere spontaneously in public and remembered themselves too soon. Eppley pivoted, as companies do, to winter dry skin. Their booth at the farmers\u2019 market put out a bowl of free hand cream with a scent that wanted to be oat and almost got there, and the pharmacist smiled her professional smile and said, \u201cWe\u2019re here when you want choices,\u201d to no one in particular. Someone taped a sign to their banner at dawn, in a hand like a left turn: ABSENCE IS LOUD TOO, and the pharmacist left it up because she had, lately, found herself practicing new sports in which leaving small messes where people could see them counted as exercise.\n\nOn campus a protest braided itself into a vigil which braided itself into a dance. Students chalked the walkways with eyebrows that grinned and scowled and frowned in sympathy. A counter-group in crisp windbreakers handed out solvent coupons like a faith tract, and a girl with eyeliner that could slice bread took one and folded it into a paper crane without breaking eye contact. It felt, briefly, like theatre; then a boy with a megaphone said too loud a thing about choice that landed like a plate thrown at a family dinner, and a freshman cried in a way that the ground heard but cameras, clumsy as they are, did not. Lynette did not come in as a climax. She moved behind the bell tower where nobody not paying attention would see, lifted the sagging banner that said MUTUAL AID in letters somebody had kissed with their thumb, and tied it higher. The wind readjusted its sermon. When the crowd moved into song because they had to do something, the song had no chorus and needed one, and someone from the back who had never once wanted to lead counted them in with a hand that had been waiting to point since fifth grade.\n\nIf you were keeping track, which Dr. M was even when she tried to let a day be a day, you would have noticed how the places began to outnumber the faces. The library\u2019s side door, the one addicts used because the front felt like a test, wore a neat little line overhead that made everybody look up as they ducked in. The bus stop outside the shelter where the city performed its tidy generosity received the shape of a small eyebrow on its plexi, so slight that it took you a week to realize it had never been there before. On the asphalt outside the grocery store\u2019s employee entrance, a careful word appeared at knee-height the night an assistant manager caught a boy pocketing a burger and chose not to call the police. It said: LEFT, and quickly, below it, because we are not a city that wastes a double meaning, someone else wrote: ALONE, and a third unknown hand, tired of the way coyness can hurt, added: BE. The maintenance men at the courthouse stopped pretending they did not see and began collecting the words on a clipboard like species observed on a long walk. When their supervisor asked what for, they shrugged because sometimes a collection is its own rationale if you\u2019re the sort of person who can stand a corner going unbleached.\n\nPilar got in trouble, which had been coming like weather. She had cut a set of eyebrow stencils out of cereal boxes and carried Blue Beauty school-bathroom eyeshadow in her backpack and had been offering blue to anyone who asked, under the hand dryer that had never dried anything on time. The principal called it graffiti and said the word with a careful disdain that suggested he had learned to be polite to nouns in the seventies and never quite trusted them again. In the office that had a carpet the color of defeat, he offered her a pamphlet about choices, as if choices were a meal plan and she had missed breakfast. Dr. M, called in because Pilar had written her name under emergency contacts as if it were a spell, sat in the plastic chair that had been designed in a golden age of back pain and kept her face in the friendly neutral you offer to bureaucrats like a peace treaty. She said, \u201cPilar is participating in an ongoing community art intervention,\u201d and watched the principal\u2019s face try to decide if intervention made this witchcraft or medicine. Pilar did not smile. She had learned from the giant that earnestness should not have to be cute to survive. She said, \u201cI\u2019m helping people put on their faces,\u201d and when he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t allow makeup sharing,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of blue,\u201d and the office secretary, writing nothing and hearing everything, made a sound she concealed as a cough.\n\nAfterward, on the steps, Pilar asked if she was in trouble with Dr. M instead of the school, because the opinions of the two categories do not share a weight class. Dr. M said, \u201cI am in favor of people choosing their adjectives,\u201d and Pilar nodded as if that were a sentence to take into a quiz. \u201cNext time,\u201d Dr. M added, \u201cmaybe you put out a sign-up sheet for who wants to be painted so no one can call it coercion,\u201d and Pilar rolled her eyes and said, \u201cFine,\u201d and then, as if she had carried a small rock in her pocket all day and was finally tired of its shape, added, \u201cEverybody always thinks you\u2019re trying to make them be something. I was just trying to help people look like they already are.\u201d She sat with her knees banged together in the way of children who have not yet learned that their bodies do not need to apologize to furniture. Dr. M slumped beside her because sometimes solidarity is a posture before it is a policy.\n\nThe thing about love as fuel is that transactional people will immediately try to meter it. Two tech boys with a start-up name that sounded like a breath test launched an app that purported to index the town\u2019s acts of tenderness into a daily charge percentage for Lynette. They called it KILOLUX and their interface was beautiful the way a new knife is beautiful, and for a day the feed filled with little pings of BE KIND and TAKE OUT THE TRASH FOR YOUR ROOMMATE and DON\u2019T HONK and someone even wrote TURN BACK AND SAY SORRY TO YOURSELF and the bar climbed and the boys did a live demo in a coffee shop where the lattes would not know how to be embarrassed until they got home. The next morning the app crashed under the weight of what it did not know how to count, and the boys posted a note saying something about scaling, and a girl with blue brows shot a video in her car whispering into her phone, \u201cYou can\u2019t trick love into showing up by standing on the lawn and making airplane signals,\u201d and it got shared a hundred thousand times by the noisiest people in quiet bedrooms.\n\nOn a two-lane out past St. Joseph, the deer did what deer do and stepped into an idea without asking traffic to agree to it. A truck did what trucks do and missed by inches nobody owns. Lynette did what she had been practicing\u2014she softened a second and let one horn catch foam, and the foam refused fracture, and driver and deer both ran like people who had been allowed to stay alive. The next day, painted on the asphalt at a height tire spray wears at, the word SLOW appeared, blue like a refutation of yellow, and drivers read it with one quarter of the attention they ought and one quarter more than usual. A county crew came with their scrapers and a solvent that smelled like high school and got nowhere. They left a cone and a sign that said WORK IN PROGRESS and a boy who had learned to walk between cones and poems took that as a joke and told it to three friends.\n\nIt would have flattered the town to be hunted, and it tried to deserve it. Men came with nets and jargon who had worked in wildlife management before they learned to say asset capture. They set up on top of the parking garage with gear for whales, as if their metaphor could drag this into their field. When Lynette rounded the corner by the train tracks with less ceremony than they had rehearsed, the men threw, and the net, obedient, draped and slipped and caught the flag pole on the roof and unfurled itself as a hammock across the top tier of the structure. Three teenagers who hadn\u2019t got to be children long enough climbed laughing into it and took selfies that made their mothers yell and then keep and then, later, show to women who would get it. The men coiled their rope and tried not to look the way men look when their equipment reveals which parts were for show. Down on the street, Dr. M shook her head in a motion that contained no malice and a bilious amusement, and the sheriff, whose fingers had not faded entirely, said to no one in particular, \u201cShe\u2019s not a parade float,\u201d and then blushed because he had been thinking of homecoming again.\n\nThe parts of her chest that had sounded like a radio down the hall grew louder in the ear of anyone willing to press their cheek to their own ordinary. Dr. M began to hear verbs in the static. Help, yes, and go, yes, and stay most often, the town\u2019s favorite palindrome. One night by the flyover where trucks bellow grief for sport, she put her hand near to Lynette\u2019s ribs in a rapprochement with touch she had avoided for politeness and heard a new one: Enough. It came like breath that had been practicing discipline. Enough, not as in a limit, but as in: you are. She wrote it down crooked in her notebook because her hand had refused to look like calm.\n\nThe invitation came from a dean three time zones away with a subject line that had sworn it would be casual and had practiced. We would love you here, it said, and then offered money in the way a good school does when it has more than it needs and believes it can buy cleverness. They wanted her for a year to write a book with fewer caveats. Her cousin wrote back quickly when she forwarded the email with an ellipsis: do you need to go away to tell a story about staying. The Eppley woman, who she ran into by the bulk bins again and with whom she had developed a grudging weather report of nods, said, \u201cTake it,\u201d and meant, we all leave somehow and I prefer the version with plane tickets, and Dr. M bought oatmeal and went home and laid the email on her table as if paper could sweat. She said out loud to the plant, who was not obligated to answer, \u201cWhat if the telling has to come from here,\u201d and the plant went on being green in defiance of the window\u2019s stingy policy, which was as close to counsel as anyone gets.\n\nFarouq\u2019s Browbeat grew legs. He moved it into the Legion hall where the flag had a swarm of gold fringe like bees around honey and where the acoustics were a rumor. He opened the night with a poem in which he apologized to his ninth-grade self for sixteen things, fifteen small and one large, and he did not specify the large because specificity is a luxury some days even for poets. A girl came who had been marked at forty and read a letter to the director of the after-school program where she had been a legend for twelve years and said, \u201cI am tired of earning my way into rooms,\u201d and people who had also been trained to pay admission in personality clapped until their palms hurt. A boy came who had used the solvent on one brow and left the other and sang a song with one side of his face in shadow, and Dr. M felt the town fall a little in love with him because he had turned half a face into a story and everyone loves a story we can call symmetrical even if it isn\u2019t. After, standing by the coffee percolator that imparted an old metallic blessing to everything, the Eppley woman looked out of place and envious, and Dr. M handed her a styrofoam cup because handing someone a thing is a way to make a truce and the Eppley woman took it and said, very quietly, \u201cI keep thinking if I figure it out people won\u2019t hate me for having, you know, a job,\u201d and Dr. M said, \u201cThey don\u2019t hate you, they hate being fixed before they finish breaking,\u201d and it sounded like the kind of truth you can only say under a flag no one is taking photographs of.\n\nThe fall got hard in the way falls get hard. The first snow came early and indecisive without sticking, like a person making a joke and then apologizing. The blue did its humidity trick in reverse, darkening in faces over radiators, retreating in cold halls, returning in locker room fog and over soup bowls where someone had learned to measure cumin by the ache in their wrist. The shelter put out more cots and more rules, because that was what they had. A tent city at the edge of the tracks grew a spine. A woman named Deb, who could thread a needle in the dark, stood on a milk crate and called out numbers like a carnival and nobody came to take their numbers away. On a Tuesday night when everything felt like a bad decision and the sky had the wrong lights, Lynette lay down along the windbreak and lifted, with her ridiculous splurge-thing, a sheet of foam that turned to something better in the cold, and draped it over the tents like winter had an aunt who had finally remembered to send the blanket. The men who had committed their stubbornness to plastic were quiet, which happens so rarely in tents that you could feel it a block away. Dr. M and Farouq walked the edge with thermoses. He had bought coffee from the diner because he liked the way the woman there said sweetie without making him regret it. They handed out cups and did not pretend the cups would solve world hunger because being honest is one of the only warmths available in quantity.\n\nAt the church with the tall point that had always told people where to look, the seniors\u2019 choir\u2014women mostly, shoulders square as old barns\u2014rehearsed carols with eyebrows that would not obey style. The director, a man who had given up hair as a youthful affectation, moved his hand the way conductors do when they want you to believe your breath could make a sound behave different. The note on \u201ccomfort\u201d came out like a question and the note on \u201cjoy\u201d landed like a suitcase with a broken wheel and still, because this is what music does even when it is ungainly, people standing behind folding chairs thought for a second that they were in a better century. The janitor of the church, a woman who had her own keys at last, did not try to wipe the blue off the manger props. This year, she thought, the shepherds will have brows like banners. Joseph will look like a man who knows his face is being asked to carry more story than it can reasonably transport and will try anyway. She imagined the baby with the impossible skin as a paragraph too new to underline.\n\nDecember decided to commit. The town wore its winter like an argument, with layers that hid and revealed in equal measure. Dr. M bought boots that pretended to be waterproof and then found out. The radiator performed its old play with new ad libs and she clapped politely at the curtain call because an appliance deserves the dignity of a thank you. At the laundromat, the attendant with the hair the color of safety kept a jar on the counter where people could put quarters for strangers and a sign that said HAVE YOU BEEN SEEN TODAY in handwriting that had learned to amuse itself in high school. Dr. M brought the pillowcase in a plain bag with the top folded over like a lunch and slid it into a machine with quarters like old rules and watched the blue handprint go around like a moon that had decided to socialize. A woman in an apron that looked like combat said, \u201cThat\u2019ll never come out,\u201d and Dr. M said, \u201cI don\u2019t want it to,\u201d and the woman nodded in the international language of the quietly marked. When she took it out there was a child\u2019s sock attached by static, the sock so small it made her palms ache, and she pinned it to the corkboard under a flyer that read LOST WITH DIGNITY.\n\nAt the mosque, the girl with the winged liner had started a group chat for whoever in the youth group had blue or cared to have some and the chat had become what chats do: recipes and homework and a boy\u2019s confession that he had kissed a mirror to practice and it had not been awful, followed by forty-three blue heart emojis from someone who did not know fourteen-year-old boys find that kind of care indecent and then eventually depend on it. At Friday prayers, a grandmother whose piety was shaped like never leaving two shoes exactly side by side sat beside a teenager whose eyebrows were newly pronounced and patted her wrist with a love that did not require infrastructure. \u201cYou look like your grandad,\u201d she whispered, and the girl, who had never met him, glowed as if introduced at a party in which she had not expected to be honored.\n\nSomewhere between Christmas and the particular exhaustion January deposits in mailboxes with the guilt-shaped coupons, the Subcommittee for Community Recovery from Affection-Based Incidents released a draft of a plan nobody was required to read but many did anyway because the word plan is a drug. It proposed listening sessions and a schedule of blue-out clinics with distinct time slots and a mentorship program wherein adults with marked brows would be paired with teenagers who also had them, as if blue could be an affinity group like chess or grief. Someone had been allowed to put in a line about an art fund. Someone else had been allowed to smuggle in a line about prayer rooms. The sheriff read it in his office and drummed his fingers with the blue that had refused to fade and thought, the only plan I recognize is showing up and not yelling, and then he put his hat on because he preferred having something to do with his hands. Dr. M read it on her couch with her feet tucked under her like a lowercase g and circled the parts that seemed like an invitation and crossed out with a too-hard pencil the parts that seemed like wetsuits zipped over feelings.\n\nThey marked the foster office. It was a small word on a door lintel where no one looks until the day they are too tired to look anywhere else. It said: KEPT, and people hated it and people loved it and surface-level disagreements turned into the kind that asks a city whether it actually believes itself. A woman who had aged out of three systems she hadn\u2019t chosen stood under it and laughed until she had to bend, like something inside had at last shaken loose. She said into the air, \u201cOkay then,\u201d and the air did not write it down and did not need to. In the courthouse, a judge paused with his robe half-buttoned and read HELD and KEPT and thought about the difference between verbs done to and done with and put his hand through his hair like a man trying to comb his conscience. On the third floor of an apartment building the radiator made a noise like a verdict like a mercy like a tired child pretending to be a drum.\n\nIt was at the diner, late, where the waitress had learned to call the sheriff by his first name only when he tipped well and everybody else m\u2019am no matter their age, that Dr. M saw the Eppley woman cry. She had come alone and ordered two pancakes and a side of professionalism and received both, the pancakes arriving faster. Her ponytail had finally conceded to a clip that did not pretend to be permanent. The tears came slow and almost embarrassed of their own timing, down the neat face of a woman who had been trained by five rooms and three degrees to keep water in its pipes. Dr. M put two dollars on her own saucer and carried her coffee to the other booth without permission because sometimes you walk into a story not because you are invited but because there is a spill you can stop. She sat down and said nothing and the Eppley woman, who had never once asked anyone for help out loud because she was not the asking kind, said, after a while, \u201cNo one told me the thing I\u2019m good at would be the thing people wanted least,\u201d and Dr. M said, \u201cThey want to want it later, like insurance,\u201d and the Eppley woman laughed like a hinge getting honest. They ate in a rough theatrical silence, the kind strangers share at hospitals. When they left, the bell over the door did its old song. Outside, snow had auditioned again and landed the part, tentative and lovely, dissolving on the Eppley woman\u2019s cheek before it could be counted during anyone\u2019s testimony.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, the legions of walkers took to the path around the reservoir with their good intentions zipped in. Dr. M went too because there are rituals even the skeptical find themselves repeating, if only to be near other people who have decided to walk in an unthreatening circle as if that were a sentence the day could use. The lake wore its ice like someone experimenting with eyeliner: too thick here, too thin there, absolutely impossible to get even. Dogs learned again that their feet can be confused. A couple who had nearly broken and had not stood at the railing and looked down like people who had seen a ghost and had agreed not to feel that way about him again. Lynette had crept in behind the trees and put her hand on the patched chain link where teenagers had perfected the art of kissing briefly enough not to get yelled at and long enough to remember later. Her intake was triumphant and then tired and then steady. The verbs in her chest had learned to sing together better. Stay braided itself with go and made a new word in a language the town had not known it needed. Enough softened to be an arm across a bench, and help rose like a flock and settled like a coat.\n\nThat night, Dr. M did the thing she had tried so cleverly not to do all her days. She asked for company and did not apologize for the asking. She sent a text to the cousin, to Farouq, to Pilar\u2019s mother, to Albert, to the Eppley woman of all people, to the librarian who tied her hair with a pencil, to the janitor who had let the manger keep its blue. They came like weather comes, some on time, some dramatically late, and the apartment learned what a radiator does when a room fills with humans and their heat. They sat on chairs mismatched on purpose and the floor which had been designed for books rather than bodies and ate beans and weird little cheeses and bread that felt honorable in the hand. Pilar fell asleep with her cheek on the handprint pillow and no one moved her because moving a sleeping child is a power you do not practice unless it is required. They talked about nothing and everything and if anyone used the word community it did not grow mold in the air before it landed. When the giant passed outside, which she did, because she had learned to walk by the building like a neighbor who wants to be good at it, someone said, \u201cThere she is,\u201d and no one ran to the window because the window knew where its attention was owed.\n\nIn the small hours, when small forgivenesses receive their best chance at being said, Dr. M stood with her hand against the window glass and felt the cold be honest about what it intends. The radiator did not cough. It breathed like a person who, after eating and listening, can finally fall asleep in company. She thought of the offer with its money and its coast and its flattery and wrote on the back of an envelope, a surface that had never minded being temporary: stay. She underlined it softly; you can bruise paper if you try, and she did not. She put the envelope on the table beside the plant that had learned to be grateful for stingy light and did not check the window again to see if anyone was watching her do the right thing. She went to bed and did not dream of a boy saving the giant, and did not dream of saving anybody with a paper, and did not dream of the jail or the fair or the bandstand or the word, and woke to a town that had taken a breath and kept it, briefly, like a promise being honored in ordinary time.\n\nBy the time the students came back in January wearing coats that made them look like gentler galaxies, the blue had become winter\u2019s favorite rumor. It would show up in the frosting on a cake in a window on a Sunday and then refuse to take the same shape twice. It would refuse noses and insist on thresholds. It would write a delicate cheek-mark over the sign of the methadone clinic where a woman in slippers showed up five minutes after her dose had turned into a pumpkin and a nurse whose patience had been exercised like a hamstring said, \u201cCome tomorrow and I won\u2019t put a note in your file,\u201d and when the woman cried from the humiliating mercy, the nurse put a box of tissues on the counter and said, \u201cUse two, they\u2019re cheap,\u201d and both of them laughed because people will laugh at a bad joke if it means the power dynamic got weird for three seconds. Dr. M kept adding pins to the map and had to hang a second map to the right because towns spread. On the top edge of the second map, in a corner no thumbtack could reach, a small blue crescent appeared overnight with the exact curve of a human ear. She put her ear there and could hear, faint but earnest, one verb she had not heard before, smallest of all: learn. She took her hand off the pushpin box and put it in her pocket because learning is sometimes the same position as waiting with your hands where people can see them.\n\nThey tried some rescissions. A city crew with a budget they were slightly embarrassed by brought to the jail a new solvent donated by a company that was not Eppley and had named itself after water in a way that made the water tired. The crew wore gloves for liability and sprayed and waited and scrubbed. HELD blued their rags like a baptism that does not require belief. After an hour a young man in a knit cap said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m erasing a diary,\u201d and his supervisor said, \u201cThen stop,\u201d and he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d and the supervisor said, \u201cWe can,\u201d and they did. They rolled the machine back into the truck with the delicacy you use for burdens you\u2019ve decided not to carry. The sheriff, watching from a respectful distance, put his hand up to the blue that had refused to leave his skin, and touched his forehead again, a practice twice now. The maintenance woman at his office taped up a new calendar with a picture of a mountain that had never been in Illinois and wrote on February\u2019s blank square in a sharpie that had been purchased to mark boxes: don\u2019t forget to remember.\n\nIn a nurse\u2019s break room at Carle, where the clock had been set five minutes fast for ten years and nobody could remember why but respected the decision, a nurse with a voice like gravel and mercy said, \u201cWe need to mark the NICU,\u201d and everybody grimaced because hospitals like to keep control of their nouns and adjectives. The mark showed up anyway, thin as a whisper, on the doorframe so slight only people in the paradoxical habit of seeing too much saw it. It said: KEPT AGAIN, and the nurse with the gravel voice put her head in her hands for a second before a pager asked her body to leave its moral life on a chair and go do the job. In the cafeteria, a man with a visitor badge ate a jello that shook like a sentence trying to decide whether it had earned a semicolon and did not taste it, but the body accepts sugar as a temporary apology even when it is not listening.\n\nWhen, in late January, the wind decided to be rude and the roads decided to be themselves, the town gathered in little circles around tables that had been embarrassed all fall by being asked to hold politics and now were allowed to hold soup. The city councilman with the two-sided mouth shoveled his driveway and realized he liked the simplicity of that more than anything else he had done in six months. The librarian took down the poem about cows because it had suffered enough and put up a poster that said, in a font that did not lie about its intentions: WINTER READING CHALLENGE: COUNT YOURSELF. A teenager with a mother who had gotten good at not asking sure you\u2019re okay said, \u201cI\u2019m going to read a book without a sword in it,\u201d like a rebellion, and did. The Eppley woman knocked on Dr. M\u2019s door with a Tupperware of something soup-adjacent and a note that said, for real, and Dr. M wrote back with a clean spoon, the kind of friendship that people who have been unhelpfully capable all their lives must be taught like language late.\n\nThe blue put itself on a street corner where two boys had planned to fight and then had found themselves talking about their fathers instead, which is what happens when you put acts of violence on hold, tenderness insists. It drew a tidy little eyebrow over the traffic sign as if to say, look at the angle of your day. No one did graffiti over it because some agreements move faster than letters. In a classroom, a teacher wrote on the board: Consent is not a theory, and a boy who had stripped his eyebrows of everything he could control felt, briefly, an ease as if the room had warmed by one half degree. In the hallway, Pilar handed a new girl blue that would wash off her fingers but not her memory and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d and the girl said, \u201cI want to,\u201d in a voice like a pen hesitating over a check.\n\nWhen the first thaw came like a rumor and then left like a tease, the giant stooped under the telephone wires and touched the river for the first time since everything began. It had been there all along doing its work without applause. She put her hand flat down and the water made a sound like agreement without surrender. On the bank, Dr. M stood in a coat that had never been famous and said, \u201cAre you tired,\u201d as if you can ask tired a yes or no. Lynette lifted her hand and the water lifted with it, shallow and not, the way feeling does when you have done too much for someone and then watch them sleep. \u201cNot of you,\u201d she said, and the you meant the city and the you meant the woman and the you meant the verb. The names in her chest arranged themselves and made for a second a chord, the kind a room will teach itself if you let it. Enough leaned against learn and made a winter. Stay put its head down on help\u2019s lap and slept. Go stood by the door and did not tap its foot and did not check its watch and waited the way a good friend waits when you are putting on your shoes for the city you were trying not to love.Chapter Ten found the town in the kind of thaw that makes people audibly remember their knees. The dirty snow slackened and pulled back from curbs like a bad idea reconsidered. The blue, which had grown used to the dry, discovered the damp the way a song remembers its bridge and came forward in the mornings with a faint halo no solvent could coax on schedule. Dr. M woke to small sounds that had been hiding under winter\u2014the drip as character, the creak as epigraph\u2014and felt, in the loose way you can when there is still coffee to make and students to be kind to, that something had moved a half inch toward forgiveness. She put on a sweater that had been brave all season and went to her desk and wrote in her notebook the verbs she had heard last: learn, mend, keep, and then, hesitating as if introducing a new friend to the group, risk.\n\nIt arrived on a Tuesday in the exact middle of a sentence about nineteenth-century diaries: a risk embodied as a letter on university letterhead that looked like all letters and did not, because Pilar had been named. The administration, woke up by the committee\u2019s committee and the phone calls that bear down and the local news that had learned to pronounce chromophore, had decided that minors could not be in faculty offices during office hours unless accompanied by guardians, or unless they'd signed the right form with the right initials in the right boxes. The letter was careful not to say what it meant; it included words like liability and precedent the way people include parsley. Dr. M held it as if it might bite and then smiled with an anatomy that had to be practiced. She wrote in the margin, with less cruelty than wit: there is always a form for asking people to stop being inconveniently human. Then, because she had promised herself to practice risk, she emailed the dean and asked for a meeting and brought Pilar\u2019s mother a loaf of bread that had cost more than it ought to and tasted like competence.\n\nThe dean\u2019s office had a carpet that had been vacuumed brave and a window onto a view of a tree that had been planted with a ceremony neither of them had attended. The dean, a man who liked to push his glasses up his nose even when they had not slipped, explained the policy with a good faith he had inherited. He did not want a town to spill into his building and he did not want to be the one who had said no to a child and he did not like the mess of both. \u201cWe are trying to be consistent,\u201d he said, and Dr. M, who had spent the morning grading narratives, almost said there is no such thing and did not. She said instead, \u201cConsistency is a beautiful lie when it\u2019s not laid over people,\u201d and watched him grimace the way men do when a metaphor knocks politely at their doctrine. They compromised in the way people do when they can be seen; Pilar could come if Dr. M kept her door open and if Pilar\u2019s mother signed a permission that used the word mentoring too often and never once said collecting. Outside, the tree did its inexpensive miracle of budding, despite forms.\n\nThe fairgrounds became a winter ghost and then decided suddenly to be a church again for a day. The town declared a drive for coats and then discovered it had no place to put the line of coats it had conjured, and Albert kept the back of his truck open like a trough and laughed once all day in a way that made people hand him quarters for the laundromat even though he had not asked. Blue appeared on the chain of the gate that had always caught a boy\u2019s sleeve and made him cry and then grow a callus there he would not understand until he was a man. The word was small and precise: OPEN, written on a link as if it were a dare. A child with wrists still made for bracelets traced it and asked his mother what it meant to open a thing and not be sure what would come in. She said, \u201cWe find out,\u201d and the blue on the gate glowed as if proud of having assigned homework to the universe.\n\nThe Eppley woman showed up at Browbeat with a haircut that suggested she had remembered her head was made for weather. People had stopped booing her even in private and started letting her tell the part of the story where she had sat in the diner and cried because jobs sometimes turn you into a noun you did not meant to be. She read a small essay with the steadiness of someone admitting hand tremors, about the day she had introduced the solvent to her own reflection for five seconds and then wiped it off her own forehead for twice that long and how she had hated herself for wanting to see if the world would be nicer to her if she complied. The room made a hush that had learned respect without applause. After, a chemist from down the block who had been quietly in love with molecules since he had blown up a lima bean in fifth grade came and said, \u201cIt matters that you also want to make people\u2019s skin not itch,\u201d and she looked at him like she might someday allow herself to be forgiven in public.\n\nOn the other side of town, under the overpass where pigeons wrote their own laws, a boy named Jai\u2014with a jaw like a decision and eyebrows that had faded to a blue the shade of history\u2014skated the same four-foot stretch of concrete until it bore a small groove only wheels know. He loved the giant the way you love an aunt you see at barbecues who tells you one sentence that saves a summer. He had a father who said the word man in different fonts and a mother who boiled tea and called it medicine because that made the day behave better. He had saved up for a new deck and then given the money to a friend who had not asked and he felt ridiculous about it with a righteousness nobody had taught him to recognize as holy. The blue found his board one evening when he had left it leaning crooked against a pillar, and when he came back in the morning his grip was a galaxy of flecks you could not sand off without turning the wood into dust. He ran his hand across it and said, \u201cOkay,\u201d to the wrong deity, and the pigeons shifted their commentary.\n\nDr. M began to catch herself using the word we in sentences where she had previously reserved the pronoun for friends and essays. \u201cWe have to assume the blue will outlast our good intentions,\u201d she said in class, chalk dust careless on cuff and wrist, and the students nodded as if this were a civic fact like taxes. The boy with the guitar fingers wrote a poem so guileless it took her breath and then put it in her hand as if asking for permission to keep it. A girl whose eyebrows had never acquired pigment made a collage of mirrors and wrote an artist\u2019s statement where she confessed, with mean genius, that sometimes she wanted blue just to shut people up about choice. The kids were fine half the time and half the time were the kind of heroic that requires an intermission, and Dr. M, who had worn her patience like a cardigan for decades, discovered a muscle under it that had not been used since her own ridiculous twenties.\n\nIn March, as if in apology for having been predictably cruel, the state sent money. You cannot mark a town and then not expect a grant to arrive. The money came in a bundle tied with the kind of reports that smell like the inside of a filing cabinet and it had stipulations that \u2014 like all stipulations \u2014 had learned to sit with their legs apart. The city councilman with the two-sided mouth licked his finger and turned the pages and said, in a tone that wanted to be generous, \u201cWe can fund mentorships,\u201d and the art teacher said, \u201cWe\u2019re already mentoring,\u201d and the nurse said, \u201cThe NICU needs chairs,\u201d and the sheriff said nothing at all because he had discovered that silence was sometimes cheaper than regret. They formed another committee because even attention has to justify itself to square tables; it met in the old Elks Lodge where the wallpaper had given up arguing with time. Someone had the good sense to call it a mutual aid fund and someone else had the sense to make it universal enough not to turn need into application, and a woman who had taught Sunday school for thirty years wrote on the whiteboard the only line that got applause: an emergency is when we hear each other faster.\n\nLynette moved decidedly through the part of town where stories go to nap: the long rectangle of self-storage where divorces and Christmas live together and do not admit it. She wrote on one door, with thrift and the steady hand of someone who has practiced not apologizing, the word SAVED, and it looked like an error until you saw the next door, which wore the word LEFT, and the next: FOR. A man stopping to pay a late fee read all three and called his sister in Decatur because there are moments you cannot carry unshared. Dr. M stood on the little break in the curb and watched this grammar be installed like a chandelier in the open air, and thought of the way a sentence rearranges a day. She put her finger on her own wrist and felt the old pulse and thought: risk.\n\nThe teenage boys with nets, now city employees with vests that permitted them to be ridiculous in sanctioned ways, pivoted to helpfulness with a professionalism that would have made their mothers proud if their mothers had been the kind to be impressed by municipal grace. They closed a street during a parade without making it worse. They lifted a too-low wire and learned how to hold their arms not like conquest but like invitation. One of them\u2014Cooper, freckles like arguments on his nose\u2014told Dr. M during a pause where faux-perimeter became leaning and listening that he had thought he was going to be the guy who caught her and now he was the guy who kept kids from walking backward into poles. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d without patronizing him, and he let himself be told; there are ways to be useful that do not sparkle on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that still feed a city.\n\nAt the library, the board approved, by an oldest-people-voice vote, the creation of a special collection labeled Ephemera of the Blue Movement, and the librarian with the pencil in her hair wrote a list that began with \u201cphotocopies of nothing\u201d and ended with \u201cmemories people think they lost.\u201d They collected solvent pamphlets and Browbeat flyers and an embroidery someone\u2019s grandma had made of a blue eyebrow that looked, accidentally, like a bird. They put the pillowcase with the handprint in a glass case without putting a name on it and everyone in town knew and didn\u2019t, and Pilar dragged three of her friends to see and whispered, \u201cThat\u2019s hers,\u201d with the pride we take in other people\u2019s myth. Dr. M stood at the back with her hands in the jacket she should have retired two winters ago and allowed herself to feel ceremonial in a way that did not require a podium.\n\nA rumor insisted on brandishing consequences. It said a legislator from the north had drafted a bill with a name that balanced badly on its shoes\u2014Public Visual Integrity Statute\u2014and that it would fine municipalities that failed to remove unsolicited pigment from municipal property within seventy-two hours. It listed clarifications that contradicted themselves like haste, including a clause about safety markings and a clause about religious exemptions and a clause about signage for the illiterate that made people argue in grocery aisles in front of endcaps. The hearing happened in a room with leather chairs that had been sat in by men who like to be told when they are right, and the bill hiccuped and did not pass that day because a janitor had taped her own handwritten sign to the back of the door: TAKE YOUR GARBAGE WITH YOU, and someone took a picture and it had eyebrows and millions of people liked it. The legislator went on the radio and said no one understands the costs of graffiti abatement and the radio man said you should come to our town and meet HELD and the legislator did not laugh and the radio man did because laughing had become, for him, survival.\n\nThe verbs adjusted. What had been enough in December shifted to tend in March, and a new one, quiet as a cat, crept in around the edges of Lynette\u2019s steady drum. It said teach, in a whisper that did not carry chalk dust and did not end in a test. She started, without meaning to look like a schedule, showing up near places where new people were trying to keep breathing: citizenship classes at the Y, the diner on the night shift when first-day waitresses burned pancakes, the rooms at the shelter where rules were recited like spells and broken like bread. At the citizenship class she put a neat bar of blue above the coat hook, just where a hand reaches up without thinking; a woman from Eritrea looked at it and laughed the way her mother had, and passed the test three days later, and the blue faded but not in her wrist. At the diner she marked the coffee machine, ridiculous and perfect, and the night shift got thirty cents\u2019 more respect on average for a week; the girls rang it up as free pie and called it rumor.\n\nApril arrived like an apology with a bouquet. The forsythia inched toward its annual shout. The sky learned to be big again without being scolding. The high school put on a spring play with limited budget and infinite willingness, and the kids painted eyebrows on the cardboard cityscape because the town had them and because they were funny and because their teacher had said yes more than was wise. The sheriff played the mayor onstage and took direction with the forlorn humility of men who are more used to giving it, and at one point his hat fell off and the blue on his fingers flicked forward and clapped before he could stop them. People laughed and then remembered to let the laughter grow into something gentler. In the wings, a boy cried without making noise and a girl handed him the sleeve of her sweater and went back on to deliver a line about taxes as if everything were under control.\n\nPilar had a fight with her mother that contained both of their grandmothers, as good fights do, and then showed up at Dr. M\u2019s door with a bag of Gushers and an apology and a question. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll ever stop on her own,\u201d she asked, meaning both Lynette and her mother and not meaning herself. Dr. M sat her at the table where the plant had at last made peace with its own lackluster window and said, \u201cPeople stop doing things all the time without doing worse things instead,\u201d and Pilar said, \u201cThat is not how anyone in my family acts,\u201d and they laughed, relieved to have named a truth that would not punish them for its accuracy. They sorted the Gushers by color as if deciding a canon. Dr. M said, \u201cDo you want to ask her for something,\u201d and Pilar said, \u201cI want her to write on the door to the bathroom at school the word safe where the seniors like to say curse words about freshmen,\u201d and the way she said safe made the air trip, and two days later, on a Tuesday that rained one street at a time, the word appeared on the underside of the stall, where a girl\u2019s head goes when she hides. It was small and just this side of prim. It was a promise made in block letters and tile.\n\nThere were, because there always are, people who were impatient with what cannot be monetized. A developer tried to fold the blue into a marketing deck for a new cluster of condos that called itself by the name of a prairie that had been eaten to build them and featured a mock-up with tastefully blue eyebrows on the residents in the rendering. The town laughed in the exhausted way of people who have seen worse ideas pass with ribbons on. The developer took down the slide and offered to fund a youth center and everyone clapped because two things can be true and one of them can be money. The youth center painted its skate ramp blue because the boy named Jai had volunteered to teach a kid to drop in without breaking, and the kid did and did not and everyone cheered and a nurse in the audience held her breath like a prayer and then let it out when the boy stood and called his mom instead of trying to be brave without.\n\nOne evening, at the end of a day that had worn its light like a good ring, Dr. M walked the path by the river with Farouq and listened to him tell a story that seemed to be about a girl and was about everything else too. He had learned to love in public with the caution of a person who had been taught to be entertaining first, and she watched him move the furniture back in his own heart so there would be space for a guest to sit without bumping a shin. He said, \u201cI used to think wanting to be chosen was a weakness and now I think it\u2019s a curriculum,\u201d and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re late to your own party,\u201d and he said, \u201cAt least I brought ice,\u201d and they grinned like people trying. They stopped near the place where the giant liked to pause, just long enough to let the verbs in her chest agree on a chorus, and the wind moved their hair like a small supervision. They did not bother to look up to see if she was there; they knew the signs when their bodies stopped performing and started noticing.\n\nThe radiators in the town had adopted a new program. They behaved. They breathed, they did not cough. Even the one in Dr. M\u2019s apartment that had staged operettas all winter learned to hum like a discreet friend. On a night when the frogs in the retention pond across from the cemetery found sudden confidence, Dr. M woke to the exact sound of her own name said kindly and then realized it had been the radiator\u2019s particular talk and laughed in the dark at the way humans wish to be invited to their own sleep. She rolled over and put her hand on the pillowcase with the handprint and did not feel sentimental, just located. In the morning she went to the jail not because anything was scheduled but because sometimes you visit the word you admire. HELD was the same color it had been when it arrived and not; a thousand eyes had touched it and that kind of attention becomes a patina. A woman standing near it with a purse that had been patched three times put her hand on the concrete next to the word and said, to the air, to the building, to her own blood, \u201cI can wait,\u201d and the verbs in Lynette\u2019s chest made a sound like recognition.\n\nAt the foster office, KEPT got a cousin. Someone, giant or not, put above the cot in the visiting room the word RETURNED in a blue so quiet you would only see it after an hour, and a child who had learned that all rooms can be modified sat under it and played with a broken truck and glanced up just once to make sure the word was still there. At the methadone clinic, the nurse with gravel added to the whiteboard in the break room a new rule that scrolled like a poem: drink water, eat something with protein, tell someone a silly story, read the word on the doorframe when you think you are the only person who has ever felt like this, make the bed because a future is coming and will need a place to sit. The staff laughed and then did it because leadership is sometimes a request at the right volume.\n\nIf there was a climax, it declined to be photogenic. It arrived on a Thursday with the ordinary cruelty of a student admitting to plagiarism and a truck breaking down on Neil Street and a grandmother losing the list she had written for her grandson and then remembering it item by item like a conjurer. A boy in a hoodie with the wrong logo went downtown with a marker he had not bought to write over HELD because a man on the internet whose face he\u2019d never seen had dared him in a way that made him feel brave. He stood with his hand and the marker and the concrete and the word and an intention he had rehearsed since noon, and the blue did not flare and Lynette did not appear and the sheriff did not call out and no one told him he was a villain or a hero. He lifted his hand and wrote in a teenager\u2019s hurried hand one letter and then another, and when he was done, on the other side of HELD, in black that would fade before the blue did, was the word LAUGHED. The boy stepped back and swallowed his own motive and started to cry and then stopped because crying in public is an ocean. Dr. M, who had rounded the corner holding a coffee she did not yet regret, stood with him without speaking because shutting up is the hardest part of witness. He told her his name like a dare and she told him her job and he looked disappointed and then relieved. Together they stood and let the words sit beside each other without choosing which one was supposed to win. Years later people would argue about whether LAUGHED was vandalism or a companion and the best arguments would end with cake.\n\nMay forgot to ask permission and arrived. The town shed its coats like statements it no longer had to make. The blue did not leave because seasons are not contracts and love is not obliged to obey the solstice. The bandstand hosted graduations that made people think about their hands and about forms and about lines, and a dozen boys with blue eyebrows did their best to look blas\u00e9 and failed beautifully. The Eppley woman wore a dress like a successful apology and sat with the chemist and held hands out of sequence with the music because people in love do not always keep time. Albert taught a kid how to secure a tarp with rope squarely and said a sentence to the effect of if you learn to tie things you will never feel quite as lost. Pilar brought a disposable camera to the fair and took photos of things in between things, the kind that Instagram cannot metabolize, and taped one to Dr. M\u2019s door where two hands almost touched and did not make a masterpiece and did make the day easier.\n\nIn the slow, reliable crisis of summer, when everything gets too much and people forget they get to sit, Lynette did something so ridiculous the town retained it without trying: she lay in the shallows of the river and let the kids climb her arm like a diving board. She did not let them dive. She said, in her way that bypassed ears, we do not turn love into danger just because the light is pretty, and the kids rolled their eyes because kids understand cynicism as religion and then lined up and jumped anyway into the shallow water with their knees up to their chests and their hands pinched on their noses, harmless as joy. A mother with her hair up to keep it from clinging to her neck cried behind her sunglasses in the accurate way of women finally given a rest for three minutes. Dr. M sat on the grass and wrote nothing down and ate a sandwich she had wrapped like a treasure, which is to say: she let herself be audience and not archive.\n\nAt dusk, with mosquitoes that had not learned boundaries and a sky that could not help showing off in pinks that would be despised if they were sweaters, the verbs in the giant\u2019s chest found a new harmony. It said stay as invitation and not demand. It said go as permission and not exile. It said learn like a door ajar and not as a chore list taped to the fridge. It said enough and meant not the end but the feast. Dr. M stood because she had sat long enough and because standing is one way to tell your body you intend to keep it. She put her hand on the trunk of a tree that had not done anything particularly poetical in a decade and felt a rhythm under the bark that people who call themselves scientists forget to put on charts. It was not a miracle. It was a town that had been leaned on and had not fallen and had decided, in that inexplicable way human places do, to teach itself how to hold.\n\nWhen she went home, the radiator did not sing but she did. She sang, badly and only two lines of a song she had known at eight, without thinking what music meant and without thinking about the neighbors above with their small feet and large opinions. The pillowcase lay on her bed like a map addressed to her. She wrote on an envelope, which had stand in for decisions admirably all winter, the words Chapter Ten ends badly if I try to make it useful, and then crossed out ends and wrote begins. In the morning she would make coffee and ask the kids to tell her everything she had forgotten, and they would and they would not, and she would write it down and leave some of it alone. The plant had put out a new leaf the size of a coin and did not apologize. Outside, the town rehearsed breathing, and under the telephone wires that had learned manners, a giant put her hand on the roof of the laundromat with the corkboard and the missing sock and the jar of quarters and remembered the names she carries out loud until they were not only hers to hold.",

                              "content": "Blue eyebrows flickered under the street lamps like minnows kissed by an oil slick. In the alley behind the multiplex on Prospect, a clutch of teenagers\u2014backpacks, skateboards, one with a mouthful of braces\u2014were laughing too loudly at something private, something they\u2019d forget by morning and pretend not to care about forgetting. The air carried the damp aftertaste of warm rain and popcorn salt. On the theater\u2019s walls, posters for movies where the worlds end had already begun to peel.\n\nIt began like this: a breeze, a hush, a ripple in the dark like a giant someone walking soft. The kids looked up, not in unison, but nearly, because the human body is a tuning fork and something in them vibrated. A shadow muddled the star-bleared sky. And then a sound like a soda bottle being opened, a cork of carbonated night\u2014pop\u2014and then a long, keen hiss.\n\nThe youngest one, a boy with a hoodie tied around his waist, thought: comet. The tallest girl thought: crane. The one who would later become famous for a joke she regretted thought: it\u2019s just wind. And then blue spattered the concrete like laughter.\n\nThe foam came first, then the dye. It arrived in an arc, a bright, ridiculous curve like a rainbow not quite finished, and it burst over their heads. It didn\u2019t sting. It didn\u2019t hurt. It smelled, insanely, like lilacs; like the kind of grocery store candle called Mist of Spring. They screamed anyway, because the night had already asked for a scream. It wove through their hair, stippled their foreheads, found their eyebrows like a musical note finding its key.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold!\u201d someone shouted. \u201cIt\u2019s cold\u2014it\u2019s cold.\u201d Someone else cursed. A boy tried to wipe it off and managed to smear it into something truer and more permanent, as if he had been waiting his whole life to inherit his face from a joke. One of the girls laughed too hard and then choked on nothing. For all of them, even before the light returned, the blue was already drying.\n\nDown the length of the alley, a corrugated dumpster bore a single handprint twenty feet off the ground. It was not blue. It was pressure, a compressed palm in steel and dust. The imprint would be found the next morning by a sanitation worker named Albert M. who had not looked up at the sky in twenty-two years and, on seeing it, would become very quiet.\n\nPeople began to talk about the eyebrows. People did not stop, not that week. Parents blinked at their children across breakfast tables, and the children stared back, as if the face they had worn overnight were a magic trick, as if their eyebrows had defected to some other civilization of the skin and all the houses on that border had been painted the wrong color. The dye wouldn\u2019t wash out. It would lighten some, then darken again in the kind of humidity Champaign grew like tomatoes. Blue that wasn\u2019t quite indigo, wasn\u2019t quite cobalt. A blue like the idea of blue.\n\nWhat the kids who were caught first had in common, you could list in a way that made sense, until it didn\u2019t: teenagers. Out too late. Missing at least one next-day responsibility. Elevated BP compared to control group. A fondness for sauces. A tendency to kiss in empty parking lots and stop right before it mattered. Someone\u2019s mother, across town, working the night shift at Carle and humming because she always humming. Everyone had a story. Everyone has a story; sometimes the story has you.\n\nAbove all of this, higher than the movie posters, higher than the highest letter on the multiplex marquee (two bulbs burned out at the top), something enormous moved with a carefulness that broke the hearts of a certain kind of person when they saw it, the kind who cry at statues because they seem to be trying too hard. She ducked, always, around the telephone wires. She moved quietly between silos and the tall eucalyptus imported by individuals with too much belief in growth. A giant, they called her later, because what else do you call a woman who can reach over a gas station canopy and catch a sparrow tumbling out of the world? It\u2019s a poor word, giant, but we use it. Lynette, said a sign under a highway overpass, in aerosol script, not quite graffiti, more like an announcement whispered to a wall. Lynette. Love is fuel.\n\nDoctor Mariani didn\u2019t see the first eyebrows. She saw the other thing. She saw the handprint on the dumpster and folded her arms over her belly as if to keep her insides from sliding to the floor. She went out there because a former student texted her at 2:07 a.m. The text had a photo of the kids, faces blurred by motion, the blue not yet dry, and in the corner of that photo was sky, a sliver, a corner where you could see it was not nothing. She kept zooming in until pixels gave way. The shape was nearly shoulder. The shape was more like a hill. It was ridiculous to zoom like that, but she did, her breath a little too loud in the library still of her apartment. Her apartment smelled like old dry books no one had ever loved (though she loved them), and the radiator had its own weak opinions and said them at all hours.\n\nHer students called her Doctor M most of the time, to her face, but sometimes, when they were unkind or too kind, her full surname arrived with a point. Mariani. As if she were an airport one could circle without ever landing. It took three drinks in a noisy bar for her to tell strangers, if they ever got that far, that she\u2019d never slept with anyone. She said it like the color of her hair, factual, a piece of trivia that lived in the same drawer as knowing the state bird. Sometimes the men across from her were decent and the stalest thing they said was: your choice. Sometimes they were not. It did not matter, not now. She had a text on her phone and old tears on her face because the radiator had thunked and made her jump and she was tired. Morning was the study. Night had been trying for years to convince her.\n\nShe taught rhetoric at the university, but what she studied, between syllabi, in padded silence, was how a story becomes an organism. Urban legends made her, if we are admitting things. The way an untrue thing grows a skeleton, stands up, and begins to walk around. All the little lies get together, shoulder-to-shoulder, and become a body trustworthy enough to break your heart. She had a shelf of photocopied clippings: the phantom hitchhiker in Paxton, the haunted harmonium in Urbana, the cow that sat down during tornado warnings. In her notes the font was always too small because there were too many connections to waste space on letters. On her windowsill a plant reached for a light the window refused to admit.\n\nYou have to understand Champaign at night. You have to see the empty lanes like veins, the MTD buses sleeping cleanly in rows, their engines clicking as they cooled. The water towers like shoulders in the distance. The far hum of the interstate, and how it\u2019s not a hum at all but a chorus learning to pronounce the word go. That first week, the days were gold and powdery and the nights stung with a sweetness that made people kind and reckless.\n\nHer student\u2019s name was Farouq and he was the one who brought it to her because he had read her paper about monsters with the wrong name. He worked nights at the multiplex tear-down crew and one of the kids who got splurged came back with his face blazing and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Why blue? Why me?\u201d They weren\u2019t asking for absolution. He was twenty, Farouq, and used to people\u2019s grief falling apart in his hands. He sent the photo and then two words: it\u2019s her.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d she asked when she called.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing up?\u201d he said, and somewhere behind him a machine rolled and rolled and tried to swallow cardboard.\n\nThey met in the alley. She wore her one pair of sneakers like a disguise. The dumpster\u2019s handprint caught the light from above. She had to reach up with her fingertips to just trace the bottom of it, and the steel was cool and a little oily and there was dirt packed into the grooves where the world had been pushed. \u201cNot a crane,\u201d she said aloud without meaning to, because one is often alone at night even when someone else breathes nearby.\n\n\u201cDid you see her?\u201d she asked, but she did not specify who, as if there were only one possible answer now in the whole lexicon of answers.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything. The kids were screaming. It was... There was this hiss. Like this,\u201d and he tried to make the sound but it came out as an impression of a dying balloon.\n\nA splurge-gun, said the rumor later, a gigantic ridiculous thing like something out of a musical where kids shoot custard at each other for the final number and no one dies. The splurge looked comical until your face was blue and your friends were blinking at you in that new way that stings more than any acid. The papers\u2014yes, there are papers, old ones that say things you don\u2019t expect\u2014had used the word in 1979. A \u201csplurge device,\u201d teens marked with dye on a dare, in Kankakee. It had been reported as prank, no giant involved, no decent photographs, but the word burrowed in like an egg. Dr. Mariani has a gift for seeing words tunnel things.\n\nShe spent three days with her eyes too wide open. Sleep stayed out of reach, polite and cruel, like a party happening two doors over. She read every post tagged with bluebrow in the first hour, then stopped, because the point at which a joke turns into a weapon is quiet, and she didn\u2019t want to watch that part in real time. She walked to the corner store on Third at 4 a.m. and the woman behind the counter looked at her face as if the blue might be there already. She bought a notebook and a pen that promised it would not skip. She wrote: she will be strong. She wrote: love is fuel. She wrote something else and then scratched it out so messily that now, decades later, that page looks like it was used to clean a wound.\n\nEveryone had a theory about Lynette. In the coffee shop on Wright that summer, the baristas wrote Lynette on cappuccinos with cinnamon. Someone in a bunny mask recited a free-verse series on the quad about giants and guilt. A boy whose eyebrows had been spared wrote a song and got in trouble for the chorus. People saw her in dreams. People saw her on the weather radar. There were grainy videos of a silhouette folding itself behind a water tower. There were blurry images of a hand tipping a water bottle to a parched dog. In so many versions, she was not villain at all, but a saint with no cathedral tall enough to hold her. In so many versions, she was exactly what you fear when you are very small and your parent says: I can\u2019t help you right now.\n\nWhat was not disputed, except by people who prefer not to see the world: the eyebrows were blue, and the blue stayed.\n\nDr. Mariani thought at first that her job would be identification. This is what scholars do, we tell ourselves, we say: this folktale rhymes with that one. This data set calls to this other. But she watched the ten-second clips and the fifteen-minute conspiracies and realized identification would be cowardice here. That she had loved monsters too much to see this one. That she had loved the idea of loving too much, too, and had smothered it to keep it from hurting her. In her apartment a spider spun a web between two bookends and the fly never came. She shook the web down in guilt the next day.\n\n\u201cI know where she\u2019ll go next,\u201d said Farouq three days into it, eating a sandwich he\u2019d made from white bread, cheese, something that might have been an onion, above the city map in the student center. They leaned over the glass together, their reflections cut up by the intersecting streets, two faces grafted onto the shape of a place that pretended it had one.\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d said Dr. M. It was easier to let him be sure. It was easier to be enlisted.\n\n\u201cProm,\u201d he said, and then he had to laugh at himself, a breath through the nose that sounded like betrayal. \u201cOkay, not prom. But the thing at Hessel. The under-fifteen soccer thing. Or Homecoming. She\u2019s marking kids. She\u2019s going to be where kids are. She loves us.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe loves you,\u201d Dr. M repeated, as if to hold the sentence until it stopped wobbling, and she saw him lift his chin, because who doesn\u2019t want to be loved by a god.\n\nYou have noticed, by now, that the rumor of Lynette always held that she was fueled by love. This was not a metaphor at the beginning. It was literal, or as literal as rumor knows how to be. The fuel was not chemical, not diesel. People swore they had seen it, the way a glow comes up through the skin, the way a face brightens when the person you have been waiting for walks into a room and it turns out to be you. They said that when Lynette took a step, it was because she thought of someone else. That when her hands opened it was because she had forgiven someone. A radio man on 92.7 The Drive, who had once been fired for laughing when a caller cried about the drought, said into his microphone, \u201cShe\u2019s a giant fuelled by love,\u201d and then the phone lines lit up.\n\nIt\u2019s obscene, said a woman who sold bread at the farmers\u2019 market, to mix love and weapons. She didn\u2019t mean weapons. She meant what it feels like to be marked. To walk into a room and have everyone know you have been chosen by something that doesn\u2019t explain itself.\n\nAt Hessel Park, on the Saturday after the first eyebrows, the air was crooked with kites. A clown inflated animals while a man with a clipboard asked people to sign up for campaign volunteer hours. Kids tugged their parents toward the shaved ice truck and someone under a tree tuned an instrument that would never play. Dr. M stood by the fountain and tried to look like a person. She carried herself like a quiet thing that had learned to put on a suit of noise when necessary.\n\n\u201cDoctor?\u201d someone said, and she turned and then had to look down because the voice was short. A girl, twelve maybe, with the blue not on her brows but in a stripe under her eye like a streak of royal war. The child smiled with the intense politeness of children who have been taught to present the world with their best manners because the world can be cruel. \u201cAre you the one who writes about ghosts?\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d said Dr. M. \u201cUsually I write about people being afraid of things they shouldn\u2019t be afraid of.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike love,\u201d said the girl, very decisively, and then she handed Dr. M a folded piece of paper. \u201cShe says hi.\u201d\n\nDr. M did not laugh in the child\u2019s face, which is a triumph. She unfolded the paper. It was from the stationary set with the cartoon cats that sold at the bookstore on campus. The paper had been folded twice and then again, turning circles are circles because they don\u2019t stop. The handwriting was large, the way some people write when they want the pen to be as big as the feeling they carry.\n\nIt said: STOP IF YOU MUST BUT DO NOT CALL ME BAD. I AM MAKING THEM VISIBLE. IT IS EASIER TO LOVE WHAT YOU CAN SEE.\n\nShe put the paper into her left pocket and felt suddenly like her body had tilted very slightly toward the ground. \u201cDid she give you this?\u201d she asked the girl.\n\nThe girl shook her head. \u201cShe gave it to Mr. Rossi and then he gave it to my mom and then my mom said this looks like something the lady who writes about ghosts should see and then she said don\u2019t go over there, and I said why not, and she said because that lady probably wants some peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mom is probably right,\u201d said Dr. M. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cPilar.\u201d\n\n\u201cPilar, you did me a favor today.\u201d She meant it like a blessing. She meant it like a sea that knows the names of the fish who swim in it.\n\nPilar shrugged, as if favors were free, and then pointed behind Dr. M\u2019s shoulder, where a boy with sky for eyebrows was climbing up onto the edge of the fountain and holding a speaker over his head in a reference he probably had not earned. The speaker slipped; he caught it. Someone else laughed. The sky went thin, the way it does before wind. You could have said the mood changed. You could have said a giant had ducked beneath the canopy of leaves and was waiting for something like permission.\n\nThe splurge this time came from the north. Dr. M knew north not because she\u2019d been a Girl Scout but because she\u2019d walked these streets too long to pretend she didn\u2019t know where home was. It came as a cough, a burst, a comic timing that belonged to a world where edges are softer. It slashed across the heads of a little wave of kids running toward the soccer field. The arc caught four, missed one, painted two in a flourish that was almost calligraphy. They had time to scream and then to laugh and then to stop laughing. The dye dripped an instant and then held fast. A woman yelled, \u201cHey!\u201d into the sky a second before a toddler, amused by her own voice, copied her exactly. Dr. M was already moving.\n\nShe didn\u2019t know what she\u2019d thought she would do. Tackle. Leap. Throw her arms out wide and say what needs to be said when someone won\u2019t stop doing the thing they say they have to do, which is: please don\u2019t.\n\nBut the shape that moved between the oaks was not a thing you tackle. It was a gentleness with weight. The giant\u2014Lynette, she must be Lynette\u2014paused, there, half her body hidden by the thick leafy fuss of a willow, one hand open as if waiting to catch rain. Dr. M stopped, because there are moments when you don\u2019t get to be a hero, unless you define hero as being properly humble.\n\nIn the hush there, Dr. M could hear something like two things pressed together: the steady drum of a big heart and the other thing, tinny, like a radio down a hall. She didn\u2019t know what the other thing was and later, when she did, she wished she had known then because she might have said a kinder sentence. The other thing was voices. The other thing was other people\u2019s names.\n\n\u201cYou will say I am cruel,\u201d said the giant, and her voice came like the last breath of air in a swimming pool. Not as words; as understanding.\n\n\u201cI will say you\u2019re choosing,\u201d Dr. M replied, forgetting she might be speaking to something that didn\u2019t speak her language the way she spoke it. \u201cI will say you are choosing a kind of pain and calling it love.\u201d\n\nLynette tilted her head, the motion so slow you could have set your watch by it if your watch were willing to tell you the truth. The sun slid off the top of her hair like water off an oiled duck. She was not beautiful the way a fashion magazine is beautiful. She was beautiful the way a wooden spoon is beautiful, worn down by stirring.\n\n\u201cYou named me in your mouth before anyone else did,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cYou reached for me with your words. Sometimes words are ladders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t name you,\u201d said Dr. M. \u201cThe city did. I\u2019m only a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a person who knows what stories eat,\u201d said Lynette, softly. She extended one hand, palm upward, and the air at the center of her palm was warm and brightening, and Dr. M had a fine, fine fear prick every pore and then settle as if at parade rest. Love, then. Fine. Love like steam. Love like something you could burn your tongue on.\n\n\u201cWhy their eyebrows?\u201d Dr. M asked, because academic is as academic does, which is: ask a small question that carries inside it a bigger question you don\u2019t want to admit out loud for fear of being sentimental. Eyebrows are ridiculous. Eyebrows are banners no one signed up to carry. Eyebrows are almost trivial.\n\n\u201cSo they can see themselves being seen,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cSo when they look mirrorward, they can\u2019t pretend. It is not punishment. You punish yourselves. It is an outline. The world has a terrible memory. I am reminding it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf what?\u201d Dr. M said. \u201cOf who? You.\u201d\n\nLynette made the smallest sound. In a small mouth, it would have been a sigh. On her it was a wind on dry grass. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to say this without breaking something,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you want me to stop, you will have to tell everyone to stop believing in the blue. Teach them that it means nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell a town what to think,\u201d Dr. M said. \u201cThat never works.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will be here a while,\u201d said Lynette, and then she turned her face and for the first time in a hundred small ways, someone saw her eyes. They were not the color of any dye.\n\nDr. M took a step because not to step is something only statues can afford. \u201cIf love is your fuel,\u201d she said, \u201cyou can choose a different road.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I,\u201d said Lynette, and there was no question in it. She bent slightly at the waist, so that her breath moved through the leaves and made the leaves speak in their own idiom. \u201cDoctor from Champaign. Virgin. Collector of ghosts. You carry so much not-doing like a trophy. You think if you do not, nothing will be done to you.\u201d\n\nIt would be possible here to write about the way the heart buckles like a folding chair. It would be possible to drag her history out into the open like a throw rug. We won\u2019t. She stood there, nonexistent height, looking up, and all the heaviness of never and maybe sat in her throat. \u201cIt worked, until it didn\u2019t,\u201d she said, not sure if she had meant to say it out loud, and a child behind her laughed at the way an ice cream slipped queerly off a cone. The world, persistent in its comedy.\n\nLynette opened her other hand. The splurge gun, if that was what it should be called, lay easy in her palm. It was a thing like a trumpet, like a toy. It was addled with stickers: a cat, a heart, a wistful face that might have been a cloud. It was absurd. It was so lightly made a child could have lifted it, if the child had also possessed hands the size of pie pans. The nozzle was caked blue as if it were a cake froster in the hands of a devout. She could have used it on anyone. She did not point it at Dr. M.\n\n\u201cWould you like to hold it?\u201d asked Lynette, like a tender aunt offers a baby to a cousin at a picnic. \u201cI can set it down. It will not spill. It only spills when I think of a face. I am disciplined. It isn\u2019t much. It is what I have.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hold weapons,\u201d said Dr. M automatically, foolishly, and then heard herself and wanted very much to laugh because how was this a weapon? How was it anything but?\n\nLynette laughed once, in surprise, right down in her belly, and for a second a flock of birds rose from the trees as if a storm had grumbled. \u201cYou hold a pen,\u201d she said. \u201cYou press it down. Same posture.\u201d\n\nSomething like falling began in Mariani\u2019s knees and she put her hand against the tree without permission. \u201cYou can stop,\u201d she said, and the edges of the words were blunt, because she didn\u2019t sand them down first. \u201cWhatever you think you\u2019re doing, you can stop doing it and not stop being who you are.\u201d\n\nLynette cocked her head again and her eyes moved to the fountain, as if the small rectangular clutch of water mattered to her in some old way. She made a small noise; maybe the noise only existed inside the bones of people who noticed. \u201cIf I stop,\u201d she said, \u201cthey go back to disappearing. If I stop, the world says: who? and it means it. I am not painting guilt on them. I am painting proof. When they are older they will say: that was me, and someone will believe them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re collecting them,\u201d said Dr. M, and she was still thinking as she spoke, always three seconds behind herself. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2014archiving. You think archived love can last longer than now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey archive wars,\u201d said Lynette. She held the splurge gun like a brown bag someone else had packed for her. \u201cThey archive sorrow. I am trying balance. It is not fair. I am trying anyway.\u201d\n\nThey looked at each other for another moment. It was not the kind of looking where a solutions pops up like a prairie dog and waves. It was the kind where you accept the terrible possibility that you cannot convince someone out of their self.\n\nA siren began and then thought better of it. The park breathed out. At the edge of the field, a coach cupped his hands around his mouth and called a name that might have been Marco, might have been Martha. It doesn\u2019t matter. It never matters which name, as long as someone says it.\n\n\u201cWill you stop?\u201d said Dr. M again. \u201cEven for a week.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a week,\u201d said Lynette, as if trying it on. \u201cI will stop when I run out of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou. All of you,\u201d Lynette said, and her eyes flicked over the park with its kites and a dog cropped too close, with its teenagers who had learned how to be looked at and then learned how to be looked away from. \u201cYou.\u201d She adjusted the splurge gun and for a second you could have believed she might hand it over. Instead she lifted it the smallest fraction of an inch, pointed it at the air above them, and squeezed. The nozzle spit a thin rope of blue that landed on nothing, made a brief, absurd ribbon hanging there, and then the ribbon fell into the fountain and became water again.\n\nA woman clapped, thinking it was a trick. A child clapped because clapping is how you tell your hands you are alive. Someone took three pictures and no matter how hard they tried later, none of those pictures would show anything more than a streak of sky and the corner of a hem. People want evidence and the world keeps a very tight budget.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make me a curse,\u201d said Lynette to Dr. M, and for an instant resentment climbed up and then obediently sat. \u201cDon\u2019t write me like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said Dr. M, and believed herself. \u201cI will write you like a question.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said Lynette, and then her outline became a little less outline. The edges of her did that thing edges do when the air is the wrong kind of hot, when everything seems to be wavering, when nothing will hold still long enough to examine. \u201cTell them,\u201d she said, \u201ctell them to find me in their faces. If they can bear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if they can\u2019t?\u201d Dr. M asked.\n\n\u201cThey will anyway,\u201d said Lynette, and then she was moving away, not like a retreat, not like a charge, but like someone who knows it is time to go because the light has changed color. She placed her palm on the water tower beyond the park just for a second as she passed it, the way people touch a doorway for luck. The water tower shivered as if it had been a long time since anyone famous had come by.\n\nDr. M stood there until a policeman who was too new at his job to be wary of quiet women approached her and said, \u201cMa\u2019am?\u201d She blinked her face back into the face she used for students who turned papers in late and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, thank you,\u201d and he nodded in relief because his training had not covered what she was.\n\nIn the days that followed, the attempts to make it stop proliferated. There were banners hung from overpasses reading: YOU ARE SEEN. There were moms with their own eyebrow pencils trying to get ahead of it, blueing their faces first and walking into high school gymnasiums with the righteousness of saints. There were sermons. There were laughs. A boy turned seventeen with the blue still luminous over his eyes and he said, into a camera in his bedroom, \u201cThanks for noticing I exist,\u201d and then he threw the camera onto his bed like a grenade and the internet applauded. A girl shaved her eyebrows off entirely and got in trouble for not following cheer team code. The dye didn\u2019t care. The dye is indifferent to hair. It clung to skin. It stayed when you tried to outrun it. It faded and then there it was again. People began to confess things to strangers on buses. People began to not meet each other\u2019s eyes. The blue became a way to talk. The blue became a way not to.\n\nDr. M made a map on her wall with yarn that didn\u2019t quite match. She pushed pins into Champaign, Urbana, and then farther out, Savoy, Rantoul, Mahomet. The footprints were never footprints. The photographs people took of Lynette\u2019s passing were always of what she did not leave: the air folded where she had been, a branch with a new arc to it, a stoplight that would not stop blinking. She wanted what the giant had left out. We all want the negative space, from time to time. That was Dr. M\u2019s vice and virtue both.\n\nAt night she sat at her kitchen table and wrote sentences down that did not yet know they were a book. She wrote, she is not a warning. She wrote, she is not a promise. She wrote, the teenagers are more resilient than we are, and then scratched that out and wrote, the teenagers are carrying something we left on the side of the road because we were tired.\n\nShe dreamed that Lynette stood outside her window at three floors high and tapped gently on the glass. She dreamed that the splurge gun made a noise like a mother making a silly noise at a baby. She dreamed that she was thirteen and that her eyebrows were so vivid they could not be borne. She woke with a taste like coin in her mouth and the radiator putting on airs. She wanted to call someone and say: I am afraid of a good thing. Instead she went to her desk and made a list of all the places a giant might hide between Urbana and here. The list included quad. The list included the big lot behind the Meijer. The list included church steeples, not because they are tall but because they are always telling you where to look.\n\nA letter arrived in her campus mailbox. It had no stamp. Someone had slid it into the slot as if the man at the counter were a confession and this was absolution. The paper was the same. The handwriting larger. It said: YOU WILL THINK I AM PICKING ON THEM. I AM NOT. THEY ALREADY THEY ALREADY THEY ALREADY. Then a long line of blue. As if the sentence ran out of itself.\n\nShe took the letter home and stared at the repeating words until they stopped being words and started being a remembering of a time when you said a thing out loud to make it real. They already what? They already are vanishing. They already are brave. They already are marked in other colors you cannot see. There are so many ways to fill in any blank; the danger is you pick the one you are hungriest to believe.\n\nA week in, there was a late-night show segment where a comedy writer in a suit papered over his nerves with a monologue about the Big Blue Brow Bandit and her youthful victims, and Dr. M turned the television off because the laughter wasn\u2019t going to help. The world can joke itself into any position it likes. The world can laugh all the sharp edges off a thing and then claim it was safe all along.\n\n\u201cAre you going to stop her?\u201d Farouq asked, the next time he saw her, on the steps of the English building where the brick fights quietly with its own age. He was holding two coffees that he thrust at her like they were answers. He looked older suddenly, the way people look older when they finally decide to say everything they\u2019ve been thinking.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want me to make her a villain,\u201d Dr. M said, as if this were the same as saying yes.\n\n\u201cWhat does she want?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants help being right without having to be wrong first.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe sounds like a professor,\u201d he said, and she barked laughter up into the bright September, and students with eyelashes like tactical gear looked over, then looked back down at their phones.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to stop her,\u201d she admitted. \u201cI\u2019m beginning to think stopping is not an option. Redirecting, maybe.\u201d\n\n\u201cRedirect her where?\u201d he said, and stepped aside for a skateboard that came humming.\n\n\u201cTo the parts of town where no one watches,\u201d Dr. M said quietly. \u201cAsk her to mark adults. Ask her to mark the sheriff. Ask her to mark me.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d he said, and got a look on his face like after you dare someone and they say fine, and you realize you were never brave enough for the dare.\n\nDr. M tried, that night, in her apartment, with the window open and the night like velvet borrowed from a theater. She spoke to the air as if it were an answering machine and she had only a minute to say everything. \u201cMark me, then,\u201d she said, voice steady in the grossly ordinary room. \u201cMark me for all the men I didn\u2019t love back because it was easier. Mark me for the kids I played fair with and the ones I gave up on because it was easier. Mark me for the glass I didn\u2019t break to get to the other side. Do your blue if you must. And then let them go.\u201d\n\nShe slept, finally, and woke with her face tingling and thought for a foolish three seconds: yes. She ran to the bathroom mirror and saw only her own eyebrows there: human, unremarkable, busily not blue. She laughed and cried at once for a minute, an ugly sound. On her way to the stove for coffee, she saw the note on the table, and picked it up as if it might be hot.\n\nIn the margin of her own letter, in her own room, between a paragraph and the word however, a smear of blue had dried in a small, tidy slash, like a punctuation mark from a foreign grammar. Not on her body. In her book. A mercy or a teasing. She touched it. The dye did not come off on her finger. It had a smell like a candy she had loved and then grown out of. She smiled in spite of herself and because of herself both.\n\nThe next morning the town woke to find the grain silo on the south edge of town had a new sign, a stripe of blue that ran from its lip down to the ground, dazzling, impossible. Someone with drone skills filmed it with swooping anger. It was a ridiculous sacrament. The silo wore it well.\n\nThis is not a story with a man in a uniform nailing a giant\u2019s ankle to the ground. This is not a story with a tranquilizer dart. That first month, the city council held a meeting that lasted four hours longer than it needed to because a woman named Judith refused to stop telling the room about the night in 1988 when she had shaved her head and no one asked her why and how that had saved her life. In a town where nothing is ever much of an emergency until the sky changes colors, people learned to say: we don\u2019t know. It was a kind of holiness.\n\nDr. M went to sleep every night with the sound of someone else\u2019s heartbeat in her ear, a borrowed noise the city had learned to make. In the thin hour between three and four, she heard footsteps sometimes. Not outside; in her head; in the map room. She moved pins around and stood on a chair to reach the top of her own wall and wrote: stop me if I say villain. She wrote: be fair to the kids. She wrote: be fair to Lynette. Be fair to the city that loves a good story because it is bored and also because it is aching.\n\nOn a Sunday evening, when the orange had a pink tucked into its hem and the air above the corn belonged to some other era, she parked her car at the edge of a field, turned off the engine, and sat in the silence that snaps everything back into itself. She got out and walked. There was a path beaten into the verge by no one in particular. A hawk hung in the acrylic sky. Five miles that way, people were watching something funny that would be unfunny in three months. Two miles that way, someone was being born. The ordinary world ripped and mended itself, as always. Then a shadow moved. Then a long arm reached out and pressed gently against a barn, as if the barn had said, my back hurts, and the hand had said, let me.\n\n\u201cYou keep expecting me to come to you,\u201d said Lynette, and Dr. M did not jump. \u201cYou keep expecting me to be where you think love will make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect to have to drive,\u201d said Dr. M, and her own voice felt like a jacket on a warm day. \u201cYou tell me where to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere,\u201d said Lynette, and when she stepped close enough that the wind off her body made the trees nod, the love-intake sound in her chest was louder than it had been. So were the other sounds. The tinny radio down the hall had doubled. Names. Names, names, names, stitched inside the bigger drum. Daniel. Tai. May. Idris. Zo\u00eb. In the future there will be arguments about whether Dr. M heard those names. There will be people who insist she made them up because she was trying to give the giant a moral jawline. Believe what you can afford to.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stop you,\u201d said Dr. M, because the older you get, the easier it is to say this. \u201cI can be with you while you do what you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a harder sentence than it looks,\u201d said Lynette, and if you had been there you would have cried a little and not known why. \u201cCome then,\u201d she said, holding out her hand, not as a lover does, not as a mother, as something else, something stranger and older, and Dr. M did not take it because the distance between a human hand and a giant hand is partly distance and partly the part of us that is still afraid of falling.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll walk,\u201d said Dr. M, and Lynette nodded like a friend and began to move, and together they traced the field\u2019s edge, and behind them the corn whispered because it is a gossip, and ahead of them a town waited to see what it would believe.",

                              "content": "Dr. M learned the pace of her. The way a field length shrank under Lynette\u2019s stride and stretched under the human one. The way the giant paused for fences like a person pausing for a memory, lifting a foot the size of a family reunion and setting it down with all the apologies an elephant eucalyptus branch has ever made. The faint metallic clink of telephone wires greeting her shoulders when she misjudged and then, immediately, did not misjudge again. When you walk beside something that cannot convincingly pretend not to be myth, you start noticing human-scale myth, too. The low drawl of insects arguing the old arguments. The slumped tractor like a man who forgot his line. The tinny radio down Lynette\u2019s hall of a chest grew louder when they passed certain yards, as if certain houses knew their names better. In one yard a porch light burned and a woman sang badly to a baby who did not care about pitch. At that house, Lynette\u2019s intake hum warmed enough to tint the air around them. It was indecent to witness and ordinary to the point of boredom, a combination that made Dr. M feel as if she had been trusted with a sandwich she could not quite eat.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an origin story,\u201d said Lynette, not looking at her, the way polite people face the road when they talk because talking is vulnerable enough. \u201cThey will make one for me. There will be a boy and a lake. There will be a lab. There will be a prayer that got big by accident. The truth is thin. I have always been here, in the sense that I am made of all your hurrying. If you want something you can pick up, pick up that.\u201d\n\nDr. M said, \u201cIf I write down no origin, they will say I omitted. If I write down five, they will say I am indecisive.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will say you are a woman,\u201d said the giant, and the soft cruelty of it made both of them wince.\n\nIn class, the following week, she brought a passage from a nineteenth-century farmer who had written about a storm as if it had asked him for a dance, and the students groaned in unison at the adjective \u201cmaidenly\u201d because some things are easy to groan at. She wrote the word witness on the board and underlined it. She wrote the word archive and drew an unsteady box around it. The kid with the guitar calluses and the eyebrows so blue they might have been stamped onto his face by an impatient god squinted at the words like they were chess pieces he wasn\u2019t ready to move. A girl with the prettiest notebooks Dr. M had seen in a decade raised her hand and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t witness inherently violent? Because you are looking at something and you can\u2019t unlook.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Dr. M said, and her white chalk hand was dusted to the wrist like she had been digging in flour. \u201cSometimes it can also be the gentlest thing we do for each other. I see you is dangerous because it opens a door. It is also delicious. Who is allowed to say I see you in this town?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer,\u201d said someone from the back, lazy with the certainty that the only pronoun anyone needed now was the giant\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s doing it to kids who don\u2019t have a language yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cKids always have a language,\u201d said the bluebrowed boy, surprising himself. \u201cAdults don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nAfter class he hovered and didn\u2019t, then hovered again. He told her his mother had wanted to paint over his eyebrows with foundation and he had said, \u201cLet it be, Ma,\u201d and now he couldn\u2019t tell if he had said that because he believed it or because he wanted to see his own face in the mirror and feel brave. He said the boys on his block had turned their own brows into flags with eyeliner and he had laughed and then hated himself for laughing. He did not cry. He was the kind of earnest that makes teachers remember why they took the job even when the building leaked. She said, \u201cWill you talk to me on the record later?\u201d and he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t make me a lesson,\u201d and she said, \u201cI can try.\u201d\n\nThe city did a thing cities do when faced with a phenomenon that resists explanation: it made a committee. The committee met in the basement of the municipal building where the floor had been polished too often and still refused to shine. There was a long table with a jug of water that tasted like its own container. There was a man with shoulders like a backboard and a pin that read BUSINESS FORWARD. There was a woman who had done daycare for forty years and had opinions about everything except her own fatigue. There was a high school principal who introduced himself as Randy even though the placard said Randall T. Merson. There was a representative from Eppley Laboratories, which had flown a woman from St. Louis with a sleek ponytail and a voice that knew how to smile. She brought a prospectus and a promise of a solvent and a word the room wanted to be balm: reversal.\n\nDr. M sat near the end and took notes as if the words might run away if she didn\u2019t nail them to the page. She wrote, in the fat space of her notebook margin, you cannot reverse a conversation by wiping your mouth. The Eppley woman said, \u201cWe are exploring a topical application that will safely deactivate the chromophores in the dye compound. We have a memorandum of understanding with the Attorney General about fast-tracking approval,\u201d and the daycare woman said, \u201cI don\u2019t care about your chromophobes\u2014\u201d and the principal said, \u201cChromophores, Mags,\u201d and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t care, either way,\u201d and the Eppley woman nodded the way women nod when men in the room are watching to see if they can deal with a tone.\n\nFrom the back came a cough like a dissent clearing its throat. Albert M., sanitation worker, hat in his hands the way a hat belongs in hands when a man comes underground, stood and did not fit into the expectation the room had laid out for how he would speak. He did not speak immediately. He looked at the jug, looked at the prospectus, looked at the sign above the door that said NO SMOKING as if it had nothing to do with him, and then said, \u201cI saw the hand.\u201d A pause. \u201cOn the dumpster.\u201d He might have been saying I saw my own life today for the first time like a map. The room rotated his sentence from angle to angle as if trying to see if the light caught. \u201cIt\u2019s not a joke,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing this big is a joke.\u201d He sat down and the Eppley woman smiled and said, \u201cExactly,\u201d which was not what he meant.\n\nLater, in the parking lot where the committee had to go back to being a parking lot, Albert held his hat low over his eyes and told Dr. M, \u201cI didn\u2019t look up for twenty-two years. I was proud of it. Felt like I was resisting a thing. I ain\u2019t sure what. When I saw her print, I thought, oh, so that\u2019s where the sky\u2019s been. Up there. Forgot it was even up.\u201d His fingers worried the brim of his hat as if it had disobeyed him and needed to be taught. \u201cI ain\u2019t got kids,\u201d he said and then, as if hearing himself say it for the first time, \u201cI ain\u2019t got kids,\u201d and looked across the lot at a girl with blue eyebrows laughing with her whole body. \u201cIt ain\u2019t right for the lab to come in and scrub a town so it looks good on paper. Sometimes a mess is a record.\u201d\n\nThe Eppley woman put a pop-up booth at the farmers\u2019 market anyway. She had the sense to leave the corporate logo off the banner and hired a local kid with soft hands to hand out pamphlets that said CHOICE in font that tried too hard. On the second Saturday she set a sample on the table\u2014a tiny jar with something so clear inside it looked like it had eaten transparency for breakfast\u2014and asked passersby to dab a dot on the pamphlet to see how it interacted with the blue dot printed there. The dot lightened, obedient as a schoolchild. A woman whose child had a unibrow so enviable everyone in line flirted with it reached a finger toward the jar and then did not touch it. Her face did the math of all the ways her kids had been saved by things she had said no to. The jar caught the sunlight and made a clean, cheap halo that a photographer would have killed for. Lynette did not come to the market. You felt, anyway, the way some people feel when they decide, privately, not to go to a party because attending would make the party about them.\n\nWhen the town hall came, it was not the one in the municipal basement; it was the kind where anyone with a grievance and a throat could be a bell. It was at the high school gym under that big mural nobody could agree about, a Native man painted so nobly you couldn\u2019t decide if he was a person or a symbol. The bleachers gave and groaned under bodies. The sound system popped and then pretended to be adequate. In the bathroom a sign over the sink told cheerleaders the correct length of their nails. Stacked under the basketball hoop were the folded chairs from the last time the town had needed someplace to sit and have feelings. Dr. M sat three rows up with Farouq, the paper of his program crinkling as if he were trying to fold it into something else. The sheriff, who had the kind of forearms that make you want to confess that you had once pocketed a grape at the grocery store, stood with a microphone and said the kinds of sentences men like to say in rooms like this, sentences that contained assess and ongoing and partnership.\n\n\u201cWe have contacted the Governor\u2019s office,\u201d said a council member with a face the exact color of fresh radishes. \u201cWe\u2019re convening a working group.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need action, not working groups,\u201d yelled a voice and five voices murmured, yes, but no one leapt to their feet. A boy with blue eyebrows and a varsity jacket had scrawled over the Eppley pamphlet in his lap: do not fix me. A woman with her hair in a scarf stood up in the aisle and said, \u201cCan you mark my husband? He doesn\u2019t see nobody unless they yell, and I am tired of yelling.\u201d Some people laughed and some people did not because they had been women with the exact same mouth.\n\nThe sheriff took it like a man takes a pie in a movie, which is to say he accepted it as part of the performance. \u201cWe will not allow vigilantism,\u201d he said, which was, everyone felt, not quite the right word. A rumor had already begun before his sentence ended that someone had seen the giant near the water tower again. A rumor had taken its shoes off and was rubbing its feet and was in no hurry. Dr. M felt the pressure change. You know that pressure change. The way the day seems to pull its sleeves down. The way your lungs consult with one another about whether now is a good time to learn to be gills.\n\nShe did not appear in full. She slid into the space where the gym ends and the sky begins, like breath under a door. A child pointed. The sheriff dropped the microphone and it made a noise like a pet you have accidentally stepped on, brief and pitying. The slow blue of the sky was a conspiracy of noncommittal. The splurge gun lifted. It did not point at teenagers. It did not point at children. It did not, notably, point at the Eppley booth slinking in from the side like a shy idea. It pointed at the banner above the stage where five words had been printed so large your own retinas were forced to absorb them: UNITY IS OUR STRENGTH. The arc cut the U and the N in two and ran down the Y like a tear. The banner wore its mark like a sash at a pageant. The collective inhale was not belief; it was recognition. On the floor, the dye trickled in old lines, found the cracks in the gym varnish and settled like a lesson. The sheriff bent, and when he stood, there was a thin blue signature on his fingers that would not wash off no matter how many towels he mangled in the locker room later. He put his hand to his forehead without meaning to, a practice salute. It left a smudge right where a saint\u2019s thumb would go.\n\nAfter, the gym did the thing gyms do when they have been asked to hold something bigger than basketball. They hummed along pretending they had always known how. The janitor\u2014a woman with keys that could open every sadness in that building and never did\u2014mopped and mopped and could not lift the blue out of the wood. She looked at the new river in the court and said, \u201cOkay,\u201d to it. Dr. M went home with the tiredness that has nothing to do with muscles and everything to do with watching your town learn a new trick.\n\nShe dreamed a whole story for Lynette that she promised, upon waking, she would never write. In the story, the giant had been a teenager once after all, had been the kid who stayed late after school to staple flyers straight, had stood in the rain because someone else\u2019s bus was late, had let a boy kiss her because he asked like a human. In the story the boy went away and the love did not, and it built a scaffolding so tall she had to climb it and when she got up there the air was thin and she saw the whole stupid beautiful town and wanted to sit in their hair like a flower no one could pull out. It was a junk story and she loved it fiercely the way you love a baby that hasn\u2019t learned its own hands. She got up and made coffee with one hand and with the other wrote: do not save her with a boy. She underlined it so hard the page bruised.\n\nPilar showed up at her office with a pack of Gushers and a request. She stood in the doorway like a bookmark and said, \u201cCan you teach me to collect?\u201d She meant like Dr. M collected rumors and with the word collect made it sound like a tender theft. Dr. M handed her a legal pad and said, \u201cStart by writing down what you think you know and put a box around what you actually saw,\u201d and Pilar did, tongue out at the corner of her mouth, determining the width of her own certainty. She wrote: she said hi. She wrote: she smells like candy, which Dr. M corrected to: she smells like the idea of candy. Pilar rolled her eyes because kids have no patience for the adult impulse to italicize everything. \u201cMy eyebrows aren\u2019t blue,\u201d Pilar said, apropos, peeling a Gusher and splitting it neatly along its seam. \u201cBut sometimes when I look in the mirror my skin looks more like a map than a face. Do you think that\u2019s what she wants?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she wants what we want,\u201d said Dr. M. \u201cTo walk into a room and not think, what do I owe this space to be allowed in it. To walk in and think, the space owes me a chair.\u201d Pilar looked at her like she had been handed a riddle in a language she almost spoke. She put the legal pad in her backpack like a fragile thing.\n\nFarouq put together a show. He called it Browbeat because puns are a way to pretend a gun isn\u2019t on the table. He rented the back room of a bar that had last hosted a jazz trio that had pretended to know one another. He invited three kids he knew and two he didn\u2019t and a woman who had been marked at forty-nine\u2014no one had seen her splurged, but her brows carried the blue like someone had painted a line on the street and then the town had had to follow it. He stood in the doorway and took five dollars and put them in a cigar box someone had once loved, and he told Dr. M, \u201cIt isn\u2019t a fundraiser, but I don\u2019t know how to do something completely for free yet.\u201d The woman with the forty-nine-year-old eyebrows got up and said into the old microphone, \u201cI am married to a dentist who eats frosting at night with a spoon, and he cried when he saw me blue, and I don\u2019t know if he cried because he saw me or because he thought he had failed to keep everything neat.\u201d The kids nodded as if she had been reading them bedtime. A boy with a shaved head and the most delicate eyelashes stood and said, \u201cEveryone keeps saying it\u2019s about being seen and, like, okay, but can I talk about how it also makes me feel like a stop sign? Like love is a car and sometimes it runs the sign and I die.\u201d There was a silence afterward that was not awkward. It was weight-bearing. It could have been a floor.\n\nThe next morning a man in a bunny mask put a stamp on the water tower itself, a blue rabbit ear floating just below the crown. Nobody knows how he got up there. He might have flown. He might have dated a girl whose father owned a bucket truck. It was a year of hacks, of recycled courage, of knowing your way around a lock. The cops laughed and pretended they didn\u2019t and said, \u201cVandalism,\u201d and half the town thought, what isn\u2019t.\n\nA letter came in the same cartoon-cat stationary, the cats wearing sunglasses this time as if someone at the campus bookstore believed in novelty. It had been slipped again into her campus box, disrespecting the whole process of postage because what is postage but the trusting of your words to a system? She unfolded it on the bus and read it while a man across the aisle practiced his frown and a girl in a track jacket slept with her mouth open. YOU WILL CALL IT CONSENT, the letter said. YOU WILL ASK ME TO ASK. I AM ASKING ALREADY INSIDE THE AIR. IF YOU LISTEN YOU WILL HEAR THEM SAYING YES TO BEING ALIVE. The bus jolted and made a mistake at the light and the letter knocked against the window and the blue in one corner glinted the way oil does when it murders a puddle. She put it away. It itched in her pocket for a full block after she got off because the body knows when there is a heat-source near, even if the heat is stupid.\n\nNo one knew where Lynette slept. The rumor said corn. The rumor said the flat roof of the mall with its ancient JC Penney sign that refused to come down out of either faith or budget. The rumor said in the cooling towers of the power plant like a goddess inside a conch. The rumor said she did not sleep, which is the kind of cruelty we wish on saints. Dr. M began to notice the places where someone large might have leaned and those places were not always high. A ditch that had been compressed into a perfect curve. The crossbar of a swing set set ever so slightly out of true and kept that way, as if a hand had said: this is where it hangs now. Her map on the wall grew thread like a sweater at a party that has a dog.\n\n\u201cLet me mark you,\u201d she said again one evening with her window open so wide the insects were voting on whether to be her roommates. \u201cIf it matters to you that I believe you are trying, then mark me.\u201d She did not turn it into a dare. She tried to turn it into an offering. She woke to the feeling of weight near her head and did not scream because some things are the kinds of gifts you take in without frightening the giver. On the pillow beside her, pressed in the hollow where a head would be if myth slept like a person, a perfect blue handprint darkened the pillowcase. The hand was not grotesque. It was human-hand-sized. It was hers. She put her palm over it and matched. She changed the pillowcase and the print stayed on the fabric; it would not wash out. She changed the sheets entirely and when she took the pillow to the laundromat, the attendant who\u2019d dyed her hair the color of a traffic cone admired it like a tie-dye that had finally got it right. She thought of sleeping on her own hand, of suffocating on the effort it takes to become. She slept without the pillow and woke with a sore neck. There are sacrifices and there are inconveniences and sometimes they are the same thing at different magnification.\n\nThe Eppley solvent made its way into two bathrooms. A boy with a mother who bought anything a woman in a lab coat told her to buy dabbed it on his left brow and not his right because he had carried fairness too far in every game he had ever played. The left paled, the right held. He went to school and someone said, \u201cYou look like a glitch,\u201d and he wanted to go home and lie still until he could no longer be called by a name. He did not. He stayed. He watched the teachers not watch him. He went to the bathroom during fourth period and wrote the word stay on a paper towel and tucked it in his pocket. Later, when he kissed a boy under the bleachers, the boy touched the right brow and then the left and then said, \u201cI like the one that stayed and the one that tried to go,\u201d and it wasn\u2019t poetry but it was worse; it was the truth, in teenage grammar, and that\u2019s better.\n\nA mother named Judith\u2014yes, the same Judith who refuses to sit down as often as breath allows\u2014started the stencil project. She cut out eyebrows from cardboard, big ones, too expressive by half, and spray-painted them blue on the sidewalks leading to the high school. Along one block the eyebrows looked curious. On the next block they were furious. On the last block they were so tired you wanted to scoop them up and carry them. A grumpy man with a leaf blower tried to harry the blue out of the concrete and the dye did its patient thing: it held. It held like a friend\u2019s hand holds you when everyone else is pretending they don\u2019t know your last name.\n\nThe letters stopped for a week and then returned on graph paper. The letters did not know what they wanted to be when they grew up. YOU WANT A PAST, this one said. I HAVE A HUNGER. IT IS NOT MY FAULT YOU CALL HUNGER A HISTORY WHEN IT STICKS AROUND THIS LONG. Dr. M laughed aloud at that and then put her hand over her mouth because she had read the sentence in the rare book room and the librarian, who wore her hair like an accusation, did not like laughter anywhere near vellum. She folded the letter up along graph\u2019s implied lines and it folded so neatly it felt like magic, and then unfolded it and the creases had become part of what the letter meant. She wrote in her notebook: she did not ask to be your invention. She wrote: admit that love is not gentle. She wrote: stop apologizing for sentences that use the word love. She drew a tiny flag beside that and put a circle around the flag and wrote: incitement to tenderness.\n\nIt was Farouq who saw it first: adults. It started at a bank drive-through where a manager who had never once said, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d to a customer walked into work with a blue crown over his eyes that made his staff stare and then look away and then have to look back because you cannot not look at the proof that someone has been touched. Then a third-grade teacher whose students refused to make wish lists because they were superstitious about asking got marked on a day she had red lipstick on and she kept the lipstick on because sometimes doubling down is also grace. Then the host of the morning show who had used the word epidemic with a little thrill in her throat found her own eyebrows complimenting her brand-new blazer like a prank her mother would have laughed at. The teenagers stopped feeling like a target and started feeling like a contagion kids would gladly give to the adults if only it could pass by touch. Teachers told them not to rub their faces against their elders and the kids did not but they wanted to because giving adulthood something you have and they don\u2019t is a pleasure as pure as rain after heat.\n\n\u201cIs this what you meant?\u201d Dr. M asked Lynette in a field behind a self-storage facility where the rows of corrugated doors looked like a painting of itself. The giant had a dime on her palm. It was not a giant dime. It was a dime. She had found it in a parking lot and had not yet given it back to the world. \u201cSharing,\u201d Dr. M said, and watched the intake hum swell when a couple in a Subaru in the lot over began to kiss as if they had not kissed in years, which perhaps they had not.\n\n\u201cIt is what I am allowed,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cI would pluck out the need to be cruel in all your bosses if I could. I am, alas, not a surgeon.\u201d She flicked the dime and it pinged a perfect note against the storage unit door and fell, and Dr. M had the childish urge to say, do it again, a greed she suppressed in favor of looking, again, at this nice woman who insists on being enormous.\n\n\u201cYou changed your mind,\u201d Dr. M said, because people like narratives that pivot, because it gives their own pivots permission.\n\n\u201cI did not,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cThe town widened. I am not a pivot; I am a measure.\u201d She looked at the self-storage units and her face did a thing like regret. \u201cLook what you keep. Look what you are willing to pay to pretend you will need again.\u201d\n\nThe county fair came as it always does, dragging with it the scent of fried participation. The ferris wheel went up and made its usual promises to couples who needed a height to make the dizziness feel chosen. The kids lined for the Gravitron and argued about who, among them, had the heart kind of strong that lets you taste metal without vomiting. The fair has always been a place where a town wears its poverty in sequins. It is honorable, this insistence on twinkle. Dr. M walked the midway with Farouq and let him talk about the girl who had laughed last week at something he had said and how he had laughed too and how he would rather be the kind of person who says, I like you, than the kind who plans thirty responses to a hypothetical text. She bought a funnel cake and let the sugar whitewash the part of her brain that kept records of everything that might go wrong. The 4-H kids showed pigs who had learned to be gods for two days and then, later, not; the kids loved them perfectly anyway. At the kissing booth, someone had hung a sign in careful cursive: NO EYEBROW DISCOUNTS. Somebody had crossed it out and written: YES EYEBROW DISCOUNTS. Under both, in an accel pen that bled through the paper: KISS EVERYBODY YOU CAN.\n\nWhen the blue came that night at the fair, it arced over the ferris wheel and caught the top of a gondola where a woman about sixty sat with a boy too old to be hers. He put his hand on hers and pretended he was the one comforting. The blue caught the edge of the tilt-a-whirl operator\u2019s forehead; he laughed and shook his head and did not pause the ride because some things cannot be paused once you\u2019ve said yes to them. It slid down the silver side of the corn dog stand and made the metal look baptized. It dripped and did not drip. At the same instant the main stage lights snapped, as if obeying more interesting electricity, and the band\u2014a good cover band, too earnest by half\u2014fell quiet without rancor. The giant reached in and lifted a string of paper lanterns that had been strung low and would have caught on her wrist. She moved them up, gently, like adjusting a necklace on the throat of a friend. The murmurs in the crowd had the special sound of a whole town aligning their spines. Nobody ran. Running would have made it all smaller. The sheriff stood with his head bare and his fingers still faintly blue and gave back the hat he\u2019d been handed because sometimes you do not deserve to cover yourself.\n\nLater that night, in a motel near the interstate where the carpet was a geography no one wanted to plot, a man came to the desk and asked for blue-out in a tone that suggested he was doing the clerk a favor by including him in his problem. The clerk, who had a mother who would not forgive him until he forgave himself, said, \u201cWe don\u2019t carry absolution,\u201d and then, because he liked his job, said, \u201cTry Eppley. They\u2019re at the farmer\u2019s market between the honey and the jars of second chances.\u201d The man left, and the clerk made a small chalk line on the back of the desk and felt calmer. He pretended, briefly, to be keeping score and then put the chalk down and decided, bravely, not to.\n\nDr. M sat with her map and moved a pin from Savoy to a farm road whose name she\u2019d driven a dozen times and never read. She wrote: the fair is a church where you can wear shorts. She wrote: she adjusted the string of lanterns. She wrote: she knows the height of us better than we do. She let herself put her head down on her desk, the way you are not supposed to because it will make you want to sleep and you have marked sleep for later. When she lifted her face, there was a faint blue half-moon on her cheek from where, somehow, somewhere, there had been a small, irresponsible smear of dye on her own notebook. She went to the bathroom and looked at her face and saw not punishment but punctuation. In the morning, it was gone. That did not mean it had not been there.\n\nThe Eppley woman left town and did not leave town. She left her jar and her pamphlets and her precise hair in the hands of a local pharmacist who had made her name giving people the wrong things for the right reasons. The jokes softened because they always do. The first boy to get married with blue eyebrows in the wedding photos cried when he saw himself in the proofs and said, to his husband and to the photographer and to the dumb white cake, \u201cI am here, fuck,\u201d and it was the most religious sentence spoken in his family in three generations. An old man with eyebrows like a mold breaking spoke to his church and said, \u201cY\u2019all thought God was going to be loud. Maybe he is bright instead,\u201d and half the church agreed and half muttered and all of them brought casseroles with noodles that took on holiness by association. A hair salon offered eyebrow styling for the unstyleable, and teenagers sat in chairs and watched the women make something ceremonial out of something imposed. No one had found a remover that did more than bruise.\n\nFrom a hill no one else called a hill\u2014because midwesterners are stingy with topography\u2014Lynette watched a thunderhead become a city. Her head tilted the way her head tilted when she was listening to a voice that had not said its name out loud yet. She looked like what we make of angels when no one is watching us make them. Dr. M drove up and parked in the place her car had learned not to roll and did not honk or wave because you don\u2019t call to the sky. She got out and stood beside the large ankle, which had a smudge of dust and one, green leaf stuck to it like a sticker put there by a child trying out an idea of ownership. She did not touch, not because she feared to, but because she is good at boundaries, sometimes to the attention-starved sadness of her own day. The air was heavy and felt like it had eaten something corrupting. The tinny radio in Lynette\u2019s chest was loud and full of names that were also places; you, you, you, Urbana, you, Prospect, you, third-floor apartment with the crying radiator.\n\n\u201cDo you want me to stop?\u201d Lynette asked, and this time it was a question that asked for an answer instead of a confession.\n\n\u201cI want you to do what you can bear living with later,\u201d said Dr. M, which was the worst and best thing she could have said. \u201cI want you to consider marking the places and not just the faces.\u201d She surprised herself with the rhyme and tried not to show that surprise to the giant because it felt like a bird that would fly away if named.\n\n\u201cWhat place do you want me to mark so your city cannot say it did not happen?\u201d asked the giant, her hands empty of instruments, which is when the worst and best things happen.\n\nDr. M thought of the courthouse steps. She thought of the mosque. She thought of the high school stage where they had performed A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream in jeans and a single evergreen tree borrowed from Christmas. She thought of her own apartment door. She said, \u201cThe jail.\u201d\n\nLynette nodded like a person who had also thought of the jail. When she moved in that direction, you could feel the ground not shake but affirm. The thunderhead did a theatrical thing because sometimes it is a gift to the town when the weather cooperates. They walked as if they had a chaperone, as if the air were a parent who did not approve of this friendship and could be convinced. The jail was uglier up close. Buildings built to hold sorrow on purpose always are. The parking lot light flickered with the pathos of fluorescent. Inside, a woman whose job it was to catalog the human body into the system\u2019s stomach paged through a book and underlined the part about \u201cidentifying marks\u201d and thought about whether she had any at all. The sheriff\u2019s blue-fingered hand reached for the switch he had meant to fix for months and then an inch of blue found the gray slab of the building and wrote, neatly, on the concrete near the door, not a symbol, not a name, but the word: HELD.\n\nThe paint did not bleed. It did not drip. It sat there like a thesis. Staff stood, later, and read it and pretended they hadn\u2019t. Men inside felt something cold and then something warm and then nothing because many of them had learned not to feel until it would not embarrass them. The word did not absolve. It did not accuse. It said, you are, which is different from the weeping I love you that songs teach. It said, you are, and the city had to count that as data.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Dr. M, because sometimes gratitude is a leash and sometimes it is a ladder and she could not tell yet which this would be.\n\n\u201cDo not thank a storm for rain,\u201d said Lynette, but her mouth had softened and the names in her chest were louder and somewhere someone decided not to die that night and someone else decided to fall in love with someone who would not hurt them and neither will become statistics. They will become the stories you tell on porches when you are feeling brave about how you have survived yourself.\n\nIt would have been narratively satisfying if, here, someone had decided to climb a water tower with a sniper rifle and end a metaphor. Nobody did. It would have been narratively satisfying for Eppley to release a solvent that stripped blue and a layer of skin with it, and for the town to have a lesson about what you are willing to take off to look like the picture in your head. The solvent made some teenagers itchy and one adult nauseous and then stopped being a trend. It would have been narratively satisfying for Dr. M to kiss someone in a parking lot and be marked mid-kiss and laugh and let the laugh live. She did not kiss anyone. She went home and cooked a pot of beans and read a novel about a woman who could hear the dead humming in the pipes like radiator ghosts and went to bed at an hour that would have made her a better person if she\u2019d been the kind of person who believed hours held moral weight.\n\nAt two, a car alarm yelled not about crime but about loneliness. At three, the radiator coughed its small cough. At four, the letters in her brain lined up and asked to be let into sentences. She let some of them. She left some out. She wrote: chapter three is not the one where we learn how to stop loving. She wrote, in a softer hand: I am trying to work out who the villain is and I keep drawing arrows back to the mirror. She wrote, tucked near the edge of the page where the spiral binding nipped at her wrist, small and honest and mean to only herself: I am good at watching. That will not be enough, soon.\n\nOutside, the town made the laugh that fair rides make when they are taken down and packed into trucks. Outside, a postman on a bike thought of the time he had wanted to leave and had not and wondered whether the wanting or the staying had altered him more. Outside, the water tower\u2019s new stripe faded one shade in order to become more itself. Outside, a giant lay down in a place we can argue about and listened to the names in her chest like a mother listens to a baby who does not cry in order to be loved. Inside, a woman put her hand over the place her heart had learned to thud on schedule, and waited for morning to tell her what to do.",

                              "content": "Chapter Five\n\nThe morning after HELD arrived on the jail, the word hovered in Dr. M\u2019s mouth like a lozenge she couldn\u2019t quite dissolve. Held: the way a hand cups a face when both people are almost brave, the way a jar keeps peaches that were once heat and tree, the way a cell remembers the shape of a body even after it is vacuumed and bleached. In her class she wrote H E L D in chalk block letters that felt childish and not, and underneath, without flourish, she wrote the synonyms the town would not reach for first: carried, kept, cradled, detained. The students eyed the list as if looking for a trap they could all leap over together. The boy with the guitar fingerpads, blue at the brows and trying not to be a sermon, said, \u201cIt\u2019s like the word won a fight,\u201d and a girl in the corner whose eyebrows were ordinary but who had carved blue moons into her sneakers with a pen nodded as if she had thought the same but had been unwilling to be first. Outside, a maintenance crew used a power washer on the courthouse steps and the water spread in a fan and then fell back, obedient to gravity and to the limits of their hose.\n\nShe avoided the jail on purpose for a day because a word like that deserves at least twenty-four hours of not being viewed through glass. It needs to sink, to find the pipes in a building and lie down along them like a length of blue vein. She walked instead to the farmer\u2019s market and stood at the end of the Eppley table where the jar sat like a sermon with a visible endpoint. There was a stack of pamphlets that had learned the town and now had creases where the same hand had handled them every Saturday. The pharmacist, who had been deputized into the role of cosmetic savior and was slightly regretting the paperwork part, smiled at her with a professional\u2019s calm and said, \u201cGood morning, Doctor,\u201d as if good could be an agreement. A boy of nine with eyebrows too fine to hold anything permanent stood on tiptoe and breathed on the jar until his mother told him to leave science alone. Farther down the row, a woman already blue at the brows bought honey from a man who called her ma\u2019am and meant it like a compliment; the honey caught light and made a gold you could argue with and never win.\n\nAt the Eppley booth a sign had sprouted in a practised hand: ASK ABOUT CONSENT. The word was becoming a currency. People moved it around, spent it on arguments, saved it for later. \u201cWe offer free consultations,\u201d said the pharmacist in a tone that tried to be lotion and almost made it. \u201cNo obligation. We want everyone to feel empowered.\u201d Empowered is a word like laminate; it sticks to whatever you press it on and gives off a smooth shine. Dr. M said, \u201cAnd if the blue, say, wasn\u2019t something that happened to them but something they are glad to have happen?\u201d The pharmacist looked at the jar again, as if she might find an answer at the bottom like tea leaves that had been poured wrong. \u201cChoice is still choice,\u201d she said, and meant it, and somewhere a teenager whose nails were bitten down to the quick decided not to show up for their appointment to try the solvent, and somewhere else a different teenager went in and did, and breathed through the sting that came up as lightly as embarrassment.\n\nThe city did not sleep through the Inauguration of the Word. People took pictures of HELD and made it their profile pictures. An old woman whose husband had died on a wet night when a truck did not hit the brakes touched the letters with her ungloved fingers and then touched her own forehead as if words were contagious in that direction too. A man in a tie wrote an email to the council with subject line BLUEBROW VANDALISM and attached two photographs: one of the jail\u2019s new signage, one of his teenage son sipping coffee and looking at the world like it was cracking open just enough to let some air in. He did not see that he had sent his heart along with his argument. Someone in the comments wrote: it\u2019s paint. Someone wrote: it\u2019s not paint if it\u2019s a petition. It turns out you can fight with nouns and no one bleeds for hours.\n\nLynette moved the way she always moved, with so much attention the attention itself made you ache. She did small things no one was keeping a ledger for. She lifted a telephone wire that had sagged dangerously across a back alley so that the truck someone had borrowed from someone\u2019s cousin could pass without losing its curl of lights. She shifted a branch that had thought about breaking in last night\u2019s wind and then decided not to because the morning looked like it could use a good tree. She pressed her hand, later, against the brick lip of a school where children come to be sorted into palatable shapes, and the brick did not soften but the air did. The intake in her chest did not waver, exactly, but it found a new rhythm, fast and then measured, as if getting used to a song a town had just learned to hum together.\n\nIn her office, under the faux-wood bulletin board where announcements for readings and workshops were tacked in layers like sedimentary rock, Dr. M found a note stuck into the corner of a poem about cows that had been weathering badly since spring. The paper had been ripped from a composition notebook; the tear was jagged in the way only spines left too long in a backpack can produce. The handwriting slanted one way and then the other, a person practicing being decisive. It read: MY BOYFRIEND DOESN\u2019T HAVE EYEBROWS BECAUSE HE SHAVED THEM IN EIGHTH GRADE AND THEY NEVER REALLY CAME BACK AND HE FEELS INVISIBLE AT THE GROCERY STORE AND VISIBLE AT THE PARTY. IS HE LESS CHOSEN. IS HE LESS. Dr. M put the note under a magnet shaped like an orange slice and answered in the next class in the only way she could without lying: \u201cThe blue can\u2019t decide whether you are chosen. That isn\u2019t its job. Your body is not a ballot box. You can stop voting.\u201d\n\nIn public, Dr. M began to be approached as if she had been deputized to hold the giant\u2019s purse. A man with a daughter and a tight jaw asked if she could tell the giant to move out beyond the corn and splurge the sky so it would rain. A girl who needed to spit and couldn\u2019t brought her spitless mouth and said, \u201cMake her write my grandmother\u2019s name somewhere.\u201d A city councilman, who had learned to say which side of his mouth to speak out of depending on who was clapping, emailed to ask if she would serve on the Subcommittee for Community Recovery from Affection-Based Incidents. She replied with a sentence that had the word deflect in it and went back to arranging sentences in a way that felt like keeping sparrows from bumping into windows.\n\nFarouq, whose body had found a gear between young and not, texted her at midnight a photo of the water tower with a new line like a heartbeat halfway up. Under it he wrote: she\u2019s measuring herself, or us? Dr. M wrote back: both, probably, and he responded with a string of hearts he would have called corny last year and now wore like a jacket he could not believe fit. He held another Browbeat and this time a boy whose foster placement had lasted four weekends stood and said into the microphone, \u201cIf I had had blue when I was little, maybe someone would have fought for me with, like, teeth,\u201d and people shifted on their chairs and then someone finally clapped because the silence was too heavy not to break. A woman with hair the color of arguments read a piece about how her daughter\u2019s blue had made her mother nice for exactly two days and then the nice had burned off like fog and left what it had always been in place. \u201cWe take the blue personally,\u201d the woman said into the mic, \u201cbut maybe this is a municipal project and not a therapy dog,\u201d and Dr. M wrote that down because it was too good and too true and too cruel not to keep.\n\nThere were other, smaller, hymnals to the blue. Someone painted eyebrows on pumpkins and set them in a row on a porch and the cat knocked them all down in one vindictive swipe. A high school art teacher, newly marked at the temple like a blessing someone had missed by an inch, put a bin of blue pencils by her classroom door with a sign that said: USE THESE FOR YOURSELF ONLY. They disappeared and returned like tide. A kid on a school bus practiced the math of looking out the window and not at the boys whose faces had become flags, and finally turned and said, \u201cYou look like superheroes, kind of,\u201d and the boy with the best blue scowled and said, \u201cWe\u2019re tired of being metaphors. We still have to do algebra.\u201d It was a living, this town; it was doing it.\n\nShe went to the jail because you cannot write HELD down twice and call yourself thorough. The building looked worse the closer she got, as buildings whose job includes sorrow often do. The blue at the door had dried to a matte she trusted; it had lost the swagger of something newly applied and settled into its slow vocation. A man in a uniform watched her look; he had the kind of face that professions grow on you after time\u2014tired, obliging, strangely tender. She said, \u201cI teach at the university,\u201d and he said, \u201cThey told me people were going to come and stare,\u201d and then he shrugged, as if a stare could be a tithe a town pays and he could live with being collection plate. Through the glass of intake she watched a woman\u2019s hair be measured with a comb, saw the woman smirk at nothing and then pull her face back into seriousness like a drawstring. In the waiting room a child slept with her mouth open on a chair and her grandmother put a sweater over her like a moral. On the wall a poster urged anyone with an opioid habit to start now the work of finishing. Someone had taped an index card under it with three words and a phone number: I CAN HELP. She put her fingers against the H of HELD the way people in a museum put their fingers against the air in front of a painting when they forget themselves and wish to own it for half a second. The concrete took her body heat and gave nothing back.\n\n\u201cWhat are you writing?\u201d asked the uniformed man, not unkindly, like a father giving a kid an easy rope to tug a story all the way out with.\n\n\u201cI am trying to name the part of us that wants to fix signal so badly we make it worse,\u201d she said, and he laughed once through his nose because who hasn\u2019t tried to call a person back by texting them four times in a row. \u201cI am trying to write down the way a town learns to dress a wound without making it a landmark.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou got a way with that,\u201d he said, and put his hand to his head as if checking his hat, as if it mattered that his blue smudge might still be there for his daughter to ask about at dinner. \u201cYou want to go in?\u201d he asked, and she shook her head. It was enough, that day, to stand outside and agree that words can hold people and let them go in the same afternoon.\n\nHer radiator held its breath and pretended to die for two minutes that night, then shuddered back to life with a sound like applause withheld. She lay down without undressing and put the pillow with the handprint under the bed because sometimes love is a glare in the dark and you need your eyes. At three she woke because the weather had come to collect on something it had promised in August. The thunder moved in the way older people dance: bold, amused, not in a hurry to impress. She watched the flashes turn her ceiling into a dictionary page and pretended she could read definition into the light. The rain began as if someone had finally said yes to a question it had been awkward to ask. The town sighed. The gutters did their work. Somewhere, a teenager who had shaved her eyebrows in defiance touched her own smooth face and felt, for the first time that week, plain and thrilled. Somewhere, a woman with blue brows kissed a man she would leave in a month and remembered that nothing you do under the sign of miracle will save you from the necessity of also doing mundane bravery.\n\nThe next day the rumor said that Lynette had been seen atop the mall, lying on her back with her hands behind her head, as if she had taken a day pass from being an omen. The rumor said she had laughed when she sneezed. The rumor said she had stroked the letter E on the JC Penney sign like a person touches a piano key they once played well. That evening, in the lot outside the Meijer that had its own weather and its own astrophysics because of how big the lights were, Dr. M stood with a shopping cart and tried to remember what she had come for. Milk. Coffee. A spray bottle for misting the plant that kept insisting on reaching toward a window that hadn\u2019t given it anything but stingy sun in months. She saw the Eppley woman pushing a cart with too much cereal in it, as if for a family or a cadre of interns. The woman\u2019s ponytail had slackened by one ambition. She recognized Dr. M without any natural pleasure and with the professional disappointment of an argument that refused a stage.\n\n\u201cYou were very effective at that meeting,\u201d the Eppley woman said, which is a thing people say when they mean, you took the attention I expected to leave with in my pocket.\n\n\u201cYou brought a solvent to a parade,\u201d said Dr. M, and then felt herself blush because she had meant it wittier than it was. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t stains.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut paint is paint,\u201d the woman said, and then, because both of them had been raised to nod at each other\u2019s competence even when disagreeing, she added, \u201cWe could study it together.\u201d Her eyes were not unkind. They glittered with the ferocity of someone who had chosen a life where they would have to be a salesman in every room, even their own bathroom mirror. \u201cIf we could take a sample from somewhere\u2014your pillow, say\u2014if we could figure out\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I have to let you in my room to prove my argument, then I\u2019ve already lost,\u201d said Dr. M, and watched the woman pretend not to have heard the intimacy of the word room. \u201cBesides, she asked me not to turn her into a villain. I don\u2019t think she\u2019d like to be turned into a reagent either.\u201d\n\n\u201cVillains sell,\u201d the Eppley woman said in a tone that was half caution, half envy. \u201cSo do cures.\u201d\n\nThey parted near the giant bins of bulk onions, each of them double-checking their list, each of them carrying something invisible in the basket under the cart. At the register a teenage boy with a pin that read TRAINEE said to Dr. M as he bagged, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s gonna be over soon?\u201d and she said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it is a thing that ends,\u201d and he said, \u201cI want to go back to not thinking about my face,\u201d and she said, \u201cI think that might be one of the things you don\u2019t get to go back to,\u201d and he folded the bag as if it needed hiding.\n\nOn the day the Homecoming parade wound down Green Street with its usual combination of auditions and apology, people lined up with lawn chairs and coolers like a river that had agreed to go slow for the afternoon. Step teams practiced a last-minute clap. A float with an actual hay bale made liability lawyers steel themselves for letters later. The marching band wore hats that made them taller, which is what hats like that are for. The football team did their best not to look ridiculous on a wagon that had been decorated by the parent who had remembered to bring glitter. The girls on the court didn\u2019t wave like queens; they waved like girls who had practiced a wave and found it silly and were now doing it anyway because life is a rehearsal until it isn\u2019t. Dr. M stood halfway down the block in the shade of a tree that had figured out how to keep eleven leaves green in defiance of the season and beside her stood a man with a dog who had understood, through no fault of her own, that crowds might require her to be patient. The sky did a trick the sky does that people who don\u2019t live under it might think was magic. The clouds parted as if a hand had lifted a curtain to see who was down there making all that noise.\n\nThe first blue came not down but sideways, threading between buildings like a laugh shared between conspirators. It arced low and brushed the top of the tuba section and then climbed, evasive and flirtatious, toward the overhanging balcony where a group of seniors had set up a lookout with a bowl of pretzels and a single bottle of terrible champagne. It hung a second above the float that carried the homecoming court and two chaperones who had the exhausted eyes of people the town would not stop asking favors of. The girls closed their eyes out of instinct, and a boy put his hand up like a visor, and the blue skipped them and marked instead the horse\u2019s plume, which was ludicrous and perfect. The horse snorted and was less interested than anyone else. The sheriff stood on a corner with his hat in his hand and a woman from the PTA told him loudly that she knew a guy who could get the banner clean, and he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to leave it there,\u201d and his voice contained a tired he had earned.\n\nThen something careless and ordinary happened a block away, as if to justify everyone\u2019s suspicion that doom is mundane. A car whose driver had tried to take a shortcut turned wrong and found the parade where the driver\u2019s plan had been. The car was not malicious. The car was a car. The driver lifted her hands away from the wheel for a second because she had been taught to regret before she had been taught to steer. The drumline turned the corner and for a heartbeat nobody was yet wrong and nobody was yet hurt. The blue came like breath before a word. It came foam-first, the ridiculous cousin of seriousness, a blossom and then a sheet, a drape like a new-ceilinged room, and it landed between car and kids and did the unscientific thing of stopping the world long enough to let it remember itself. The bumper hit foam and the foam said, no, sweetly and firmly. The drummers took three backward steps with the precision of people who practice moving their bodies together. A cymbal player let out a high laugh like something had been tickled inside his ribs. The driver put her forehead on her steering wheel and did not honk and then cried because she had come very close to becoming a person a town remembers angrily for longer than it should.\n\nA woman near Dr. M put her hand to her throat and touched her necklace like a line, as if making sure she was attached to her body. A kid, nine maybe, blue only in his mind, said, \u201cDid you see that,\u201d and by did you see that he meant, Did you see you are not always abandoned. Lynette\u2019s shadow tilted on the building in a way that made it seem she had leaned down from a place only birds use. She did not show herself in the theatrical way; she did what she had always done: managed the world around the edges so the edges would do less harm. The foam dissolved faster than anyone expected and left a taste in the air like a cheap candle that you love because it reminds you of an aunt who smelled like better.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how I would explain this in a memo,\u201d said a man behind Dr. M in a tie loosened to an acceptable degree for a Saturday. \u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d said his wife, who had been the kind of teen who never got elected to anything and is now the kind of adult who knows almost everything. \u201cYou bring cupcakes to the next meeting and you say we were lucky.\u201d The band moved on. The horse thumped his hooves in a rhythm that would have been a rhythm even without the drumline. The teenagers on the float leaned their heads together and tried to make a moment into a future and the moment, kindly, did not oblige.\n\nAfter, at the library where a program promised READ TO A DOG and meant it, children sat on carpet squares and practiced the art of placing their voices somewhere soft. A golden retriever of a temperament saints envy lay down with a sigh as if he had been doing things all day more difficult than staying in a warm place and being adored. A boy with newly blue brows held a book about a hungry caterpillar like a contract and read the way nine-year-olds do, breathless on the wrong words. The dog blinked and took in the boy. In the corner a librarian, who had been living lately on coffee and the ability to put her hair up with a pencil, closed her eyes for seven seconds the way people pray when they no longer know how to pray out loud. On the community board a flyer for the subcommittee had been pinned with three tacks that did not match, because cores of bureaucracy still kept the old injustice of mismatched supplies.\n\nShe did not sleep much anymore, or rather sleep came in and out like tide with a preference for the hours when human beings want to be otherwise. In the small hours she wrote a letter to Lynette she would not deliver. It said: I have been writing about you as if you are a metaphor because metaphors are the only giant thing I have tools for. It said: you are a person, and I do not know what moral obligations I owe a person who is also an event. It said: I am trying to tell the truth without making a weapon from your body. It said: I have loved stories to the point of hurting the thing being told. It said, smaller: I am tired of myself.\n\nIn the morning she went to the mosque with a scarf she did not know how to tie and someone helped her without making it a lesson. She sat on the women\u2019s side and watched people treat their bodies as tools and not as problems. The imam had a voice like good bread. He spoke about looking up and finding the sky exactly where it had always been and everyone understood what he meant without anyone saying her name. A toddler in tiny sweatpants escaped his mother\u2019s hand and walked toward the prayer row and a woman who was not his mother put two fingers gently on his shoulder and guided him back with a kindness that should have its own noun. As they put their shoes back on, a teenage girl with blue eyebrows and eyeliner with a wing sharp enough to cut a pose smiled at Dr. M like a person recognizes a regular they have never taken money from. \u201cShe was outside last night,\u201d the girl said, and meant the giant and not God. Her voice did not shake even though she had spent a year using it for less.\n\n\u201cDoes she make you feel seen?\u201d asked Dr. M, and the girl snorted, a delicacy. \u201cShe makes everybody feel like they know how tall they are,\u201d she said, and then, \u201cMy dad says he doesn\u2019t want to live in a town with a monster, and my mom says we already do,\u201d and then she put her headphones back on because two parents is a lot of weather.\n\nA week of rain gave the town shapes they had forgotten: puddles that reflected circles when someone threw a pebble, ditches that carried their water like contraband they would distribute later to lawns unworthy of saving. People forgot the smell of dust and remembered instead how clothing smells when it has been hung to dry in a kitchen. In that wet week, blue streaks appeared in places the giant could not have reached except by imagination: the undersides of footbridges, the lip of the bandstand in West Side Park, the rim of the fountain where someone had tied a ribbon for a cause no one could agree on. She was marking places. She was listening. She was reading the town\u2019s mind like a map and only writing on the parts everyone drove past without remorse.\n\nChildren started playing a game called Held. It involved one child standing with arms out and the others running at them as if to be stopped and the held child deciding, in a second, whether to say no and hold or turn and accept and be knocked down. There were rules that were never written and all of them had to do with the gentleness of falling. A boy with a haircut his mother did with her own hands stood up after a particularly well enacted held and said, \u201cThat\u2019s what she\u2019s doing,\u201d and another kid said, \u201cShe\u2019s not catching,\u201d and the first said, \u201cShe can\u2019t catch everything,\u201d and then they went in to wash their hands for dinner and it took twenty minutes because children always find a way to make water into a festival.\n\nThe Eppley solvent became another thing on a list people kept on the back of their minds: call dentist, pick up dry cleaning, decide whether to deactivate chromophores. Mothers formed factions without admitting it, the way people form bracket pools. There were Facebook groups with names like EYES UP and BLUE AND TRUE and LET KIDS CHOOSE. A woman whose political portfolio included rage and casseroles went door to door with a stack of consent forms that meant nothing and everything. \u201cDo you consent to being seen,\u201d she asked at one door, and the man said, \u201cI thought I did until now,\u201d and she laughed and took his signature anyway because people like her are the ones who keep a town moving from one story to the next without losing too many along the way.\n\nOn a Thursday afternoon that looked like any Thursday, a man who called himself a radio personality and who had kept the job because he knew when not to say what was in his mouth said into a mic: \u201cWe\u2019ve got Doctor Mariani with us today to talk about our very own big-hearted blue-browed bruha\u2014\u201d and then caught himself in time to not live on that sentence forever. She sat across from him and watched him reach for a joke and put it down with, for him, astonishing grace. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching this from the start,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been watching people watch it,\u201d and he leaned in as if that were the angle that mattered. \u201cWhat do we do now,\u201d he asked in the voice men have learned to use when they are ready to be forgiven, \u201cwhen the world is different from the one we arranged ourselves to live in?\u201d There was feedback in her headphones that made the question seem like it had asked itself twice. She could have said policy. She could have said prayer. She said, \u201cWe keep allowing the kids to tell us what hurts and what doesn\u2019t and believe them both,\u201d and the radio made the smallest noise a machine can make when it realizes it has accidentally done something holy.\n\nShe heard from a cousin she had not spoken to in eight years, a woman with two kids and a faith that had not bent when it might have been easier. The cousin wrote an email that began, I\u2019ve been following your giant, as if one could be genealogically connected to a phenomenon, and then told her a long, mild story about a girl in their town whose forehead had been marked with something she couldn\u2019t wash away, and how the town had turned that mark into a program with a budget and how the budget had saved exactly three people in one year and exactly no one the next and how sometimes what you can do is not a verdict on what you should. \u201cDo you have someone to eat dinner with,\u201d the cousin asked at the end, not as a trap, not as pity, just as a question, and Dr. M wrote back, I have a plant and a teenager who brings me Gushers, and the cousin wrote, that counts.\n\nThe rumor insisted on being relevant. It said: she was seen with her ear against the wall of the school like a doctor with a stethoscope to a barrel. It said: she put her finger to her mouth in a shh at a couple fighting in the parking lot of the diner so earnestly they stopped mid-syllable and then laughed at themselves until the laughter took over the fight\u2019s real estate. It said: she lay down in a field and covered her face with her hands like a child playing and the corn rustled as if covering her with a blanket. It said: she is tired. It said: she is not tired, she is charging. It said: she can\u2019t run out as long as we do not. People wrote that in places their friends would see and felt like they had done something about the weather.\n\nLate one evening, when the tomato plants in the community garden wore heavy fruits like secrets and the rabbits pretended they had not been involved, Dr. M met Lynette there because Pilar had said, \u201cShe likes the smell of the vines when they\u2019re green,\u201d and children know where gods prefer to stand. The giant crouched with her knees like folded scaffolding and watched a worm glimmer itself out of a patch of cracked dirt into soil that would be kinder. Her intake was busy; she sounded like a city at a distance. Dr. M did not bow, because naked awe had never been her style, but she stood straighter than usual. She felt her own posture the way a dancer must; it mattered in the presence of someone invented to make an angle out of air.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re marking the places,\u201d Dr. M said, and it was not a question, it was gratitude baked into a statement.\n\n\u201cI am letting the ground confess,\u201d said Lynette. \u201cYou had it all written down in your walking anyway. I am cleaning up your penmanship.\u201d She smiled and the tomatoes in the nearest cage seemed, for a second, to lean like small worshippers.\n\n\u201cWill you mark me,\u201d said Dr. M, as if ordering a drink slowly, syllable by syllable, to make sure she did not mispronounce the part that would turn the bartender either kind or cruel.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Lynette, and then, \u201cNo,\u201d and then, \u201cI have. I will. I won\u2019t. You are already.\u201d The giant lifted a thumb and pressed it gently against the inside of Dr. M\u2019s wrist, the skin that had held a thousand betrayals and a thousand small courtesies from strangers who had handed her change carefully. When she took her thumb away there was the faintest fog of blue, as if someone had breathed a color onto her. It did not last. It did not need to. Her heart struck her ribs like a child knocking to be let from a closet where they had gone to see what bravery felt like.\n\n\u201cEverybody keeps asking me to stop her,\u201d a man had told Dr. M at the hardware store that afternoon as he filled a paper bag with screws and a quiet hopelessness. \u201cI\u2019m a man who makes fences,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to make fences that keep out tenderness.\u201d In the garden, she said to Lynette, \u201cYou are teaching us how to be held,\u201d and Lynette shook her head in that slow, stately way that made the gesture an essay. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cYou are remembering.\u201d\n\nThe night wore down to its thinness. The garden\u2019s little flags on toothpicks, which had been pretending to matter all season, snapped in a small wind. Somewhere behind them a train complained its way across the town\u2019s spine. \u201cYou will not write me as a miracle,\u201d said the giant, and Dr. M heard the plea in it, the professional desire to be taken seriously even while being used by the gods. \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. M, and the word was a promise she felt like a weight. \u201cA manual, maybe,\u201d she said, and Lynette laughed and the tomatoes leaned again and Dr. M did not try to capture it with a camera because some things you cannot paragraph without killing.\n\nThe next day Pilar came by with her legal pad bent and thick with new ink. She had made columns: what I think, what I know, what I hope. In the first column she had written, adults need this more than us sometimes, and in the second, blue doesn\u2019t hurt, and in the third, that when I am older I will not forget how to look. She had drawn tiny eyebrows in the margin, all different moods. She put the pad on the table with a thump like a book reporting for duty. \u201cDo you want to come with me to the fair again tonight,\u201d she asked, casual in the way twelve-year-olds are when they are begging for companionship and pretending not to care. \u201cI want to watch the teenagers watch the teenagers,\u201d she said, and Dr. M understood the way a person understands the instructions for putting a dresser together even if none of the pieces quite look like the drawing.\n\nThey stood by the ferris wheel and watched the couples trust the machinery, watched the way hands find each other when bodies are suspended. A boy with eyebrows the color of a bruise in a place you can\u2019t show held the hand of a boy who would, in a week, tell him he was scared of the world and show it by not calling. A girl in a dress she had haggled out of a thrift store\u2019s back rack looked up and missed the kiss and then got it when the car came back down and did not die. The weather was so sure of itself the hair on people\u2019s arms lay flat. \u201cDo you think she gets tired of liking us,\u201d Pilar asked, voice small enough that it might have been a soup spoon. \u201cWe\u2019re not that easy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she is practicing being a person,\u201d said Dr. M, both meaning it and not, \u201cand that is the longest job there is.\u201d The giant was not visible. The giant was a rumor that had decided to take the night off for the sake of everyone\u2019s blood pressure. The blue hung about wholesale as if reconsidering where it would look best in the morning. A little boy licked blue cotton candy and then looked at his fingers, and chose not to wipe them on his shirt, and his mother loved him so much in that second she had to sit down.\n\nAt home, later, the radiator did not cough. It breathed like a cat that has found the right spot on a blanket and will not move despite the existence of the universe. She stood in the tiny rectangle of her kitchen and considered the beans on the stove, the plant that had learned to accept what it was offered, the pillowcase she had folded and put on a top shelf the way people put their good jewelry. She took the pillowcase down. She held it up so the blue handprint was opposite her face and then she did the simplest good thing she had done in months: she took it back to bed and slept with her cheek on it as if sleeping on that particular past would make a better morning. The dream did not come. She woke without trembling and made coffee and did not sweeten it. She went to her desk before her email could ask for her and wrote, finally: Chapter Five. She wrote: We widen. She wrote: A town remembers. She wrote: A woman is a plural. She wrote: I am trying. Then she went out into a day that had decided, for once, to be straightforward. The sky wore its blue uncomplicated, the buses kept their schedules like stiff upper lips, and somewhere a giant lifted one more low wire that had been waiting to take the wrong head off.",

Turn left at HELD, they said, as if love and detention could be a landmark the same way as the Dairy Queen. The students in Dr. M\u2019s classes began to date the semester by which public thing had turned blue last. A boy in a hoodie said mid-discussion, \u201cRemember before the bandstand?\u201d and someone else said, \u201cThat was like a week before the courthouse steps, I think,\u201d and they were wrong, and they were right in the way memory is right: it organizes itself into the order that wounds heal, not the order that calendars keep. The town\u2019s sentences had absorbed the nouns. The verbs were next.\n\nIt was in the rotunda at the Statehouse where the air smelled like grant money and old speeches that someone decided to make a hearing. The committee chairs wore ties their spouses had ironed like ultimatums. The folding chairs made a sound when they opened that brought school gyms to mind, which was a kind of humility even when nobody meant it. The Governor did not come. He sent a man with a jaw like a door who said words that fit into any afternoon, like bipartisan and framework, and the words floated up and got caught in the chandelier\u2019s complicated ribs. Dr. M sat three rows back with a spiral notebook whose curl had learned to make indents on her wrist. The Eppley woman spoke first, crisp as a celery heart, about chromophores and voluntary protocols and an opportunity for public-private partnership that made three men in the front row exhale like the word partnership had just paid last month\u2019s rent. A mother spoke who had painted her own eyebrows blue in solidarity and had discovered that her daughter did not want a twin so much as a witness; the mother said, \u201cI thought I was joining her boat but I was steering it without asking,\u201d and the room did not applaud because applause would have hurt the sentence.\n\nAlbert, hat in hand and nervous system honed by early mornings, cleared his throat and told them all about the hand on the dumpster as if that hand were the only brief he had brought. He said, \u201cI didn\u2019t look up for twenty-two years and that\u2019s on me,\u201d and a man with a pen stopped clicking it because sometimes shame is contagious in a good way. He told them about the stripe on the silo and how his route now included it even though it never had before, how it had changed the time it took him to do his job not at all and his sense of what a job is completely. When he sat down, a woman with a bang of hair that suggested competence leaned forward and asked, gently, \u201cMr. M., do you support state action to remediate unauthorized markings on public infrastructure?\u201d and he said, \u201cI support learning to call a mark a memory,\u201d and the stenographer typed that like a person entering a foreign word they had been taught to respect.\n\nThey asked Dr. M up and she went because her body had learned that declining reshapes an afternoon and she did not have the kind of energy reshaping takes. She said into the microphone that kettled her voice, \u201cI teach how words become bodies when enough of us carry them,\u201d and saw the Eppley woman\u2019s mouth twist into an almost-smile that said: you know how to do this too. She spoke about witnesses and archives and the difference between reversing and repenting. She said, \u201cThe blue is not a bruise you can soothe with money,\u201d and the committee member with the creased tie winced in a way that made her want to say sorry and did not. When they asked if she knew where Lynette slept, she said, \u201cOf course,\u201d watching their eyes widen before she added, \u201cIn us,\u201d and the room made a simultaneous mistake with its mouth and almost laughed. She felt cruel for the instinct to make a joke halfway down the stairs of her seriousness and kinder for catching it by the collar and turning it into a point. After, in the echoing hall where interns practice looking purposeful, a young woman with a staff badge whispered, \u201cMy eyebrows never took it, but I still think of washing my face as telling her something,\u201d and Dr. M touched the girl\u2019s shoulder with three fingers the way strangers can when the rules loosen.\n\nIt was not all hearings and hymns to municipal process. At the high school, the art teacher with the mark at her temple curated an exhibit called Visible, hung in the cafeteria where curry and chlorine had seeped into the walls as if smell could be paint. Kids made self-portraits that refused the name selfie and used as much blue as the supply closet could offer. A boy who had been, all his life, told to make himself small so other people could fit, drew his face too big for the paper on purpose, the brows a horizon line he dared you to misinterpret. A girl whose blue had faded in the dry heat of the school\u2019s winter vents made a collage in which her eyebrows were two small rivers feeding one larger river and taped beneath it, in block letters that had kissed a ruler: I AM HOT AND COLD AT ONCE. At parent night a woman paused in front of a piece in which the only blue was a postage-stamp-sized square in the middle of a forehead, and she said something to her son about minimalism in the tones she used when she did not want to admit to complicated feelings, and he shrugged in the dialect of sixteen and walked on.\n\nWhen the first frost finally took the crabgrass\u2019 arrogance, the blue did a trick science could not publish without inviting ridicule. In the crisp, the brows went faint, as if asleep, and in kitchens where kettles hissed and bathrooms where showers fogged mirrors, they darkened again, reasserting, like ink reappearing under lemon heat. An entire thread appeared on the town subreddit about humidity and dye bonds and someone wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s like kindness, it goes farther when the air lets it,\u201d and immediately deleted it because they had been sincere spontaneously in public and remembered themselves too soon. Eppley pivoted, as companies do, to winter dry skin. Their booth at the farmers\u2019 market put out a bowl of free hand cream with a scent that wanted to be oat and almost got there, and the pharmacist smiled her professional smile and said, \u201cWe\u2019re here when you want choices,\u201d to no one in particular. Someone taped a sign to their banner at dawn, in a hand like a left turn: ABSENCE IS LOUD TOO, and the pharmacist left it up because she had, lately, found herself practicing new sports in which leaving small messes where people could see them counted as exercise.\n\nOn campus a protest braided itself into a vigil which braided itself into a dance. Students chalked the walkways with eyebrows that grinned and scowled and frowned in sympathy. A counter-group in crisp windbreakers handed out solvent coupons like a faith tract, and a girl with eyeliner that could slice bread took one and folded it into a paper crane without breaking eye contact. It felt, briefly, like theatre; then a boy with a megaphone said too loud a thing about choice that landed like a plate thrown at a family dinner, and a freshman cried in a way that the ground heard but cameras, clumsy as they are, did not. Lynette did not come in as a climax. She moved behind the bell tower where nobody not paying attention would see, lifted the sagging banner that said MUTUAL AID in letters somebody had kissed with their thumb, and tied it higher. The wind readjusted its sermon. When the crowd moved into song because they had to do something, the song had no chorus and needed one, and someone from the back who had never once wanted to lead counted them in with a hand that had been waiting to point since fifth grade.\n\nIf you were keeping track, which Dr. M was even when she tried to let a day be a day, you would have noticed how the places began to outnumber the faces. The library\u2019s side door, the one addicts used because the front felt like a test, wore a neat little line overhead that made everybody look up as they ducked in. The bus stop outside the shelter where the city performed its tidy generosity received the shape of a small eyebrow on its plexi, so slight that it took you a week to realize it had never been there before. On the asphalt outside the grocery store\u2019s employee entrance, a careful word appeared at knee-height the night an assistant manager caught a boy pocketing a burger and chose not to call the police. It said: LEFT, and quickly, below it, because we are not a city that wastes a double meaning, someone else wrote: ALONE, and a third unknown hand, tired of the way coyness can hurt, added: BE. The maintenance men at the courthouse stopped pretending they did not see and began collecting the words on a clipboard like species observed on a long walk. When their supervisor asked what for, they shrugged because sometimes a collection is its own rationale if you\u2019re the sort of person who can stand a corner going unbleached.\n\nPilar got in trouble, which had been coming like weather. She had cut a set of eyebrow stencils out of cereal boxes and carried Blue Beauty school-bathroom eyeshadow in her backpack and had been offering blue to anyone who asked, under the hand dryer that had never dried anything on time. The principal called it graffiti and said the word with a careful disdain that suggested he had learned to be polite to nouns in the seventies and never quite trusted them again. In the office that had a carpet the color of defeat, he offered her a pamphlet about choices, as if choices were a meal plan and she had missed breakfast. Dr. M, called in because Pilar had written her name under emergency contacts as if it were a spell, sat in the plastic chair that had been designed in a golden age of back pain and kept her face in the friendly neutral you offer to bureaucrats like a peace treaty. She said, \u201cPilar is participating in an ongoing community art intervention,\u201d and watched the principal\u2019s face try to decide if intervention made this witchcraft or medicine. Pilar did not smile. She had learned from the giant that earnestness should not have to be cute to survive. She said, \u201cI\u2019m helping people put on their faces,\u201d and when he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t allow makeup sharing,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s not that kind of blue,\u201d and the office secretary, writing nothing and hearing everything, made a sound she concealed as a cough.\n\nAfterward, on the steps, Pilar asked if she was in trouble with Dr. M instead of the school, because the opinions of the two categories do not share a weight class. Dr. M said, \u201cI am in favor of people choosing their adjectives,\u201d and Pilar nodded as if that were a sentence to take into a quiz. \u201cNext time,\u201d Dr. M added, \u201cmaybe you put out a sign-up sheet for who wants to be painted so no one can call it coercion,\u201d and Pilar rolled her eyes and said, \u201cFine,\u201d and then, as if she had carried a small rock in her pocket all day and was finally tired of its shape, added, \u201cEverybody always thinks you\u2019re trying to make them be something. I was just trying to help people look like they already are.\u201d She sat with her knees banged together in the way of children who have not yet learned that their bodies do not need to apologize to furniture. Dr. M slumped beside her because sometimes solidarity is a posture before it is a policy.\n\nThe thing about love as fuel is that transactional people will immediately try to meter it. Two tech boys with a start-up name that sounded like a breath test launched an app that purported to index the town\u2019s acts of tenderness into a daily charge percentage for Lynette. They called it KILOLUX and their interface was beautiful the way a new knife is beautiful, and for a day the feed filled with little pings of BE KIND and TAKE OUT THE TRASH FOR YOUR ROOMMATE and DON\u2019T HONK and someone even wrote TURN BACK AND SAY SORRY TO YOURSELF and the bar climbed and the boys did a live demo in a coffee shop where the lattes would not know how to be embarrassed until they got home. The next morning the app crashed under the weight of what it did not know how to count, and the boys posted a note saying something about scaling, and a girl with blue brows shot a video in her car whispering into her phone, \u201cYou can\u2019t trick love into showing up by standing on the lawn and making airplane signals,\u201d and it got shared a hundred thousand times by the noisiest people in quiet bedrooms.\n\nOn a two-lane out past St. Joseph, the deer did what deer do and stepped into an idea without asking traffic to agree to it. A truck did what trucks do and missed by inches nobody owns. Lynette did what she had been practicing\u2014she softened a second and let one horn catch foam, and the foam refused fracture, and driver and deer both ran like people who had been allowed to stay alive. The next day, painted on the asphalt at a height tire spray wears at, the word SLOW appeared, blue like a refutation of yellow, and drivers read it with one quarter of the attention they ought and one quarter more than usual. A county crew came with their scrapers and a solvent that smelled like high school and got nowhere. They left a cone and a sign that said WORK IN PROGRESS and a boy who had learned to walk between cones and poems took that as a joke and told it to three friends.\n\nIt would have flattered the town to be hunted, and it tried to deserve it. Men came with nets and jargon who had worked in wildlife management before they learned to say asset capture. They set up on top of the parking garage with gear for whales, as if their metaphor could drag this into their field. When Lynette rounded the corner by the train tracks with less ceremony than they had rehearsed, the men threw, and the net, obedient, draped and slipped and caught the flag pole on the roof and unfurled itself as a hammock across the top tier of the structure. Three teenagers who hadn\u2019t got to be children long enough climbed laughing into it and took selfies that made their mothers yell and then keep and then, later, show to women who would get it. The men coiled their rope and tried not to look the way men look when their equipment reveals which parts were for show. Down on the street, Dr. M shook her head in a motion that contained no malice and a bilious amusement, and the sheriff, whose fingers had not faded entirely, said to no one in particular, \u201cShe\u2019s not a parade float,\u201d and then blushed because he had been thinking of homecoming again.\n\nThe parts of her chest that had sounded like a radio down the hall grew louder in the ear of anyone willing to press their cheek to their own ordinary. Dr. M began to hear verbs in the static. Help, yes, and go, yes, and stay most often, the town\u2019s favorite palindrome. One night by the flyover where trucks bellow grief for sport, she put her hand near to Lynette\u2019s ribs in a rapprochement with touch she had avoided for politeness and heard a new one: Enough. It came like breath that had been practicing discipline. Enough, not as in a limit, but as in: you are. She wrote it down crooked in her notebook because her hand had refused to look like calm.\n\nThe invitation came from a dean three time zones away with a subject line that had sworn it would be casual and had practiced. We would love you here, it said, and then offered money in the way a good school does when it has more than it needs and believes it can buy cleverness. They wanted her for a year to write a book with fewer caveats. Her cousin wrote back quickly when she forwarded the email with an ellipsis: do you need to go away to tell a story about staying. The Eppley woman, who she ran into by the bulk bins again and with whom she had developed a grudging weather report of nods, said, \u201cTake it,\u201d and meant, we all leave somehow and I prefer the version with plane tickets, and Dr. M bought oatmeal and went home and laid the email on her table as if paper could sweat. She said out loud to the plant, who was not obligated to answer, \u201cWhat if the telling has to come from here,\u201d and the plant went on being green in defiance of the window\u2019s stingy policy, which was as close to counsel as anyone gets.\n\nFarouq\u2019s Browbeat grew legs. He moved it into the Legion hall where the flag had a swarm of gold fringe like bees around honey and where the acoustics were a rumor. He opened the night with a poem in which he apologized to his ninth-grade self for sixteen things, fifteen small and one large, and he did not specify the large because specificity is a luxury some days even for poets. A girl came who had been marked at forty and read a letter to the director of the after-school program where she had been a legend for twelve years and said, \u201cI am tired of earning my way into rooms,\u201d and people who had also been trained to pay admission in personality clapped until their palms hurt. A boy came who had used the solvent on one brow and left the other and sang a song with one side of his face in shadow, and Dr. M felt the town fall a little in love with him because he had turned half a face into a story and everyone loves a story we can call symmetrical even if it isn\u2019t. After, standing by the coffee percolator that imparted an old metallic blessing to everything, the Eppley woman looked out of place and envious, and Dr. M handed her a styrofoam cup because handing someone a thing is a way to make a truce and the Eppley woman took it and said, very quietly, \u201cI keep thinking if I figure it out people won\u2019t hate me for having, you know, a job,\u201d and Dr. M said, \u201cThey don\u2019t hate you, they hate being fixed before they finish breaking,\u201d and it sounded like the kind of truth you can only say under a flag no one is taking photographs of.\n\nThe fall got hard in the way falls get hard. The first snow came early and indecisive without sticking, like a person making a joke and then apologizing. The blue did its humidity trick in reverse, darkening in faces over radiators, retreating in cold halls, returning in locker room fog and over soup bowls where someone had learned to measure cumin by the ache in their wrist. The shelter put out more cots and more rules, because that was what they had. A tent city at the edge of the tracks grew a spine. A woman named Deb, who could thread a needle in the dark, stood on a milk crate and called out numbers like a carnival and nobody came to take their numbers away. On a Tuesday night when everything felt like a bad decision and the sky had the wrong lights, Lynette lay down along the windbreak and lifted, with her ridiculous splurge-thing, a sheet of foam that turned to something better in the cold, and draped it over the tents like winter had an aunt who had finally remembered to send the blanket. The men who had committed their stubbornness to plastic were quiet, which happens so rarely in tents that you could feel it a block away. Dr. M and Farouq walked the edge with thermoses. He had bought coffee from the diner because he liked the way the woman there said sweetie without making him regret it. They handed out cups and did not pretend the cups would solve world hunger because being honest is one of the only warmths available in quantity.\n\nAt the church with the tall point that had always told people where to look, the seniors\u2019 choir\u2014women mostly, shoulders square as old barns\u2014rehearsed carols with eyebrows that would not obey style. The director, a man who had given up hair as a youthful affectation, moved his hand the way conductors do when they want you to believe your breath could make a sound behave different. The note on \u201ccomfort\u201d came out like a question and the note on \u201cjoy\u201d landed like a suitcase with a broken wheel and still, because this is what music does even when it is ungainly, people standing behind folding chairs thought for a second that they were in a better century. The janitor of the church, a woman who had her own keys at last, did not try to wipe the blue off the manger props. This year, she thought, the shepherds will have brows like banners. Joseph will look like a man who knows his face is being asked to carry more story than it can reasonably transport and will try anyway. She imagined the baby with the impossible skin as a paragraph too new to underline.\n\nDecember decided to commit. The town wore its winter like an argument, with layers that hid and revealed in equal measure. Dr. M bought boots that pretended to be waterproof and then found out. The radiator performed its old play with new ad libs and she clapped politely at the curtain call because an appliance deserves the dignity of a thank you. At the laundromat, the attendant with the hair the color of safety kept a jar on the counter where people could put quarters for strangers and a sign that said HAVE YOU BEEN SEEN TODAY in handwriting that had learned to amuse itself in high school. Dr. M brought the pillowcase in a plain bag with the top folded over like a lunch and slid it into a machine with quarters like old rules and watched the blue handprint go around like a moon that had decided to socialize. A woman in an apron that looked like combat said, \u201cThat\u2019ll never come out,\u201d and Dr. M said, \u201cI don\u2019t want it to,\u201d and the woman nodded in the international language of the quietly marked. When she took it out there was a child\u2019s sock attached by static, the sock so small it made her palms ache, and she pinned it to the corkboard under a flyer that read LOST WITH DIGNITY.\n\nAt the mosque, the girl with the winged liner had started a group chat for whoever in the youth group had blue or cared to have some and the chat had become what chats do: recipes and homework and a boy\u2019s confession that he had kissed a mirror to practice and it had not been awful, followed by forty-three blue heart emojis from someone who did not know fourteen-year-old boys find that kind of care indecent and then eventually depend on it. At Friday prayers, a grandmother whose piety was shaped like never leaving two shoes exactly side by side sat beside a teenager whose eyebrows were newly pronounced and patted her wrist with a love that did not require infrastructure. \u201cYou look like your grandad,\u201d she whispered, and the girl, who had never met him, glowed as if introduced at a party in which she had not expected to be honored.\n\nSomewhere between Christmas and the particular exhaustion January deposits in mailboxes with the guilt-shaped coupons, the Subcommittee for Community Recovery from Affection-Based Incidents released a draft of a plan nobody was required to read but many did anyway because the word plan is a drug. It proposed listening sessions and a schedule of blue-out clinics with distinct time slots and a mentorship program wherein adults with marked brows would be paired with teenagers who also had them, as if blue could be an affinity group like chess or grief. Someone had been allowed to put in a line about an art fund. Someone else had been allowed to smuggle in a line about prayer rooms. The sheriff read it in his office and drummed his fingers with the blue that had refused to fade and thought, the only plan I recognize is showing up and not yelling, and then he put his hat on because he preferred having something to do with his hands. Dr. M read it on her couch with her feet tucked under her like a lowercase g and circled the parts that seemed like an invitation and crossed out with a too-hard pencil the parts that seemed like wetsuits zipped over feelings.\n\nThey marked the foster office. It was a small word on a door lintel where no one looks until the day they are too tired to look anywhere else. It said: KEPT, and people hated it and people loved it and surface-level disagreements turned into the kind that asks a city whether it actually believes itself. A woman who had aged out of three systems she hadn\u2019t chosen stood under it and laughed until she had to bend, like something inside had at last shaken loose. She said into the air, \u201cOkay then,\u201d and the air did not write it down and did not need to. In the courthouse, a judge paused with his robe half-buttoned and read HELD and KEPT and thought about the difference between verbs done to and done with and put his hand through his hair like a man trying to comb his conscience. On the third floor of an apartment building the radiator made a noise like a verdict like a mercy like a tired child pretending to be a drum.\n\nIt was at the diner, late, where the waitress had learned to call the sheriff by his first name only when he tipped well and everybody else m\u2019am no matter their age, that Dr. M saw the Eppley woman cry. She had come alone and ordered two pancakes and a side of professionalism and received both, the pancakes arriving faster. Her ponytail had finally conceded to a clip that did not pretend to be permanent. The tears came slow and almost embarrassed of their own timing, down the neat face of a woman who had been trained by five rooms and three degrees to keep water in its pipes. Dr. M put two dollars on her own saucer and carried her coffee to the other booth without permission because sometimes you walk into a story not because you are invited but because there is a spill you can stop. She sat down and said nothing and the Eppley woman, who had never once asked anyone for help out loud because she was not the asking kind, said, after a while, \u201cNo one told me the thing I\u2019m good at would be the thing people wanted least,\u201d and Dr. M said, \u201cThey want to want it later, like insurance,\u201d and the Eppley woman laughed like a hinge getting honest. They ate in a rough theatrical silence, the kind strangers share at hospitals. When they left, the bell over the door did its old song. Outside, snow had auditioned again and landed the part, tentative and lovely, dissolving on the Eppley woman\u2019s cheek before it could be counted during anyone\u2019s testimony.\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, the legions of walkers took to the path around the reservoir with their good intentions zipped in. Dr. M went too because there are rituals even the skeptical find themselves repeating, if only to be near other people who have decided to walk in an unthreatening circle as if that were a sentence the day could use. The lake wore its ice like someone experimenting with eyeliner: too thick here, too thin there, absolutely impossible to get even. Dogs learned again that their feet can be confused. A couple who had nearly broken and had not stood at the railing and looked down like people who had seen a ghost and had agreed not to feel that way about him again. Lynette had crept in behind the trees and put her hand on the patched chain link where teenagers had perfected the art of kissing briefly enough not to get yelled at and long enough to remember later. Her intake was triumphant and then tired and then steady. The verbs in her chest had learned to sing together better. Stay braided itself with go and made a new word in a language the town had not known it needed. Enough softened to be an arm across a bench, and help rose like a flock and settled like a coat.\n\nThat night, Dr. M did the thing she had tried so cleverly not to do all her days. She asked for company and did not apologize for the asking. She sent a text to the cousin, to Farouq, to Pilar\u2019s mother, to Albert, to the Eppley woman of all people, to the librarian who tied her hair with a pencil, to the janitor who had let the manger keep its blue. They came like weather comes, some on time, some dramatically late, and the apartment learned what a radiator does when a room fills with humans and their heat. They sat on chairs mismatched on purpose and the floor which had been designed for books rather than bodies and ate beans and weird little cheeses and bread that felt honorable in the hand. Pilar fell asleep with her cheek on the handprint pillow and no one moved her because moving a sleeping child is a power you do not practice unless it is required. They talked about nothing and everything and if anyone used the word community it did not grow mold in the air before it landed. When the giant passed outside, which she did, because she had learned to walk by the building like a neighbor who wants to be good at it, someone said, \u201cThere she is,\u201d and no one ran to the window because the window knew where its attention was owed.\n\nIn the small hours, when small forgivenesses receive their best chance at being said, Dr. M stood with her hand against the window glass and felt the cold be honest about what it intends. The radiator did not cough. It breathed like a person who, after eating and listening, can finally fall asleep in company. She thought of the offer with its money and its coast and its flattery and wrote on the back of an envelope, a surface that had never minded being temporary: stay. She underlined it softly; you can bruise paper if you try, and she did not. She put the envelope on the table beside the plant that had learned to be grateful for stingy light and did not check the window again to see if anyone was watching her do the right thing. She went to bed and did not dream of a boy saving the giant, and did not dream of saving anybody with a paper, and did not dream of the jail or the fair or the bandstand or the word, and woke to a town that had taken a breath and kept it, briefly, like a promise being honored in ordinary time.\n\nBy the time the students came back in January wearing coats that made them look like gentler galaxies, the blue had become winter\u2019s favorite rumor. It would show up in the frosting on a cake in a window on a Sunday and then refuse to take the same shape twice. It would refuse noses and insist on thresholds. It would write a delicate cheek-mark over the sign of the methadone clinic where a woman in slippers showed up five minutes after her dose had turned into a pumpkin and a nurse whose patience had been exercised like a hamstring said, \u201cCome tomorrow and I won\u2019t put a note in your file,\u201d and when the woman cried from the humiliating mercy, the nurse put a box of tissues on the counter and said, \u201cUse two, they\u2019re cheap,\u201d and both of them laughed because people will laugh at a bad joke if it means the power dynamic got weird for three seconds. Dr. M kept adding pins to the map and had to hang a second map to the right because towns spread. On the top edge of the second map, in a corner no thumbtack could reach, a small blue crescent appeared overnight with the exact curve of a human ear. She put her ear there and could hear, faint but earnest, one verb she had not heard before, smallest of all: learn. She took her hand off the pushpin box and put it in her pocket because learning is sometimes the same position as waiting with your hands where people can see them.\n\nThey tried some rescissions. A city crew with a budget they were slightly embarrassed by brought to the jail a new solvent donated by a company that was not Eppley and had named itself after water in a way that made the water tired. The crew wore gloves for liability and sprayed and waited and scrubbed. HELD blued their rags like a baptism that does not require belief. After an hour a young man in a knit cap said, \u201cI feel like I\u2019m erasing a diary,\u201d and his supervisor said, \u201cThen stop,\u201d and he said, \u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d and the supervisor said, \u201cWe can,\u201d and they did. They rolled the machine back into the truck with the delicacy you use for burdens you\u2019ve decided not to carry. The sheriff, watching from a respectful distance, put his hand up to the blue that had refused to leave his skin, and touched his forehead again, a practice twice now. The maintenance woman at his office taped up a new calendar with a picture of a mountain that had never been in Illinois and wrote on February\u2019s blank square in a sharpie that had been purchased to mark boxes: don\u2019t forget to remember.\n\nIn a nurse\u2019s break room at Carle, where the clock had been set five minutes fast for ten years and nobody could remember why but respected the decision, a nurse with a voice like gravel and mercy said, \u201cWe need to mark the NICU,\u201d and everybody grimaced because hospitals like to keep control of their nouns and adjectives. The mark showed up anyway, thin as a whisper, on the doorframe so slight only people in the paradoxical habit of seeing too much saw it. It said: KEPT AGAIN, and the nurse with the gravel voice put her head in her hands for a second before a pager asked her body to leave its moral life on a chair and go do the job. In the cafeteria, a man with a visitor badge ate a jello that shook like a sentence trying to decide whether it had earned a semicolon and did not taste it, but the body accepts sugar as a temporary apology even when it is not listening.\n\nWhen, in late January, the wind decided to be rude and the roads decided to be themselves, the town gathered in little circles around tables that had been embarrassed all fall by being asked to hold politics and now were allowed to hold soup. The city councilman with the two-sided mouth shoveled his driveway and realized he liked the simplicity of that more than anything else he had done in six months. The librarian took down the poem about cows because it had suffered enough and put up a poster that said, in a font that did not lie about its intentions: WINTER READING CHALLENGE: COUNT YOURSELF. A teenager with a mother who had gotten good at not asking sure you\u2019re okay said, \u201cI\u2019m going to read a book without a sword in it,\u201d like a rebellion, and did. The Eppley woman knocked on Dr. M\u2019s door with a Tupperware of something soup-adjacent and a note that said, for real, and Dr. M wrote back with a clean spoon, the kind of friendship that people who have been unhelpfully capable all their lives must be taught like language late.\n\nThe blue put itself on a street corner where two boys had planned to fight and then had found themselves talking about their fathers instead, which is what happens when you put acts of violence on hold, tenderness insists. It drew a tidy little eyebrow over the traffic sign as if to say, look at the angle of your day. No one did graffiti over it because some agreements move faster than letters. In a classroom, a teacher wrote on the board: Consent is not a theory, and a boy who had stripped his eyebrows of everything he could control felt, briefly, an ease as if the room had warmed by one half degree. In the hallway, Pilar handed a new girl blue that would wash off her fingers but not her memory and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d and the girl said, \u201cI want to,\u201d in a voice like a pen hesitating over a check.\n\nWhen the first thaw came like a rumor and then left like a tease, the giant stooped under the telephone wires and touched the river for the first time since everything began. It had been there all along doing its work without applause. She put her hand flat down and the water made a sound like agreement without surrender. On the bank, Dr. M stood in a coat that had never been famous and said, \u201cAre you tired,\u201d as if you can ask tired a yes or no. Lynette lifted her hand and the water lifted with it, shallow and not, the way feeling does when you have done too much for someone and then watch them sleep. \u201cNot of you,\u201d she said, and the you meant the city and the you meant the woman and the you meant the verb. The names in her chest arranged themselves and made for a second a chord, the kind a room will teach itself if you let it. Enough leaned against learn and made a winter. Stay put its head down on help\u2019s lap and slept. Go stood by the door and did not tap its foot and did not check its watch and waited the way a good friend waits when you are putting on your shoes for the city you were trying not to love.",

The dirty snow slackened and pulled back from curbs like a bad idea reconsidered. The blue, which had grown used to the dry, discovered the damp the way a song remembers its bridge and came forward in the mornings with a faint halo no solvent could coax on schedule. Dr. M woke to small sounds that had been hiding under winter\u2014the drip as character, the creak as epigraph\u2014and felt, in the loose way you can when there is still coffee to make and students to be kind to, that something had moved a half inch toward forgiveness. She put on a sweater that had been brave all season and went to her desk and wrote in her notebook the verbs she had heard last: learn, mend, keep, and then, hesitating as if introducing a new friend to the group, risk.\n\nIt arrived on a Tuesday in the exact middle of a sentence about nineteenth-century diaries: a risk embodied as a letter on university letterhead that looked like all letters and did not, because Pilar had been named. The administration, woke up by the committee\u2019s committee and the phone calls that bear down and the local news that had learned to pronounce chromophore, had decided that minors could not be in faculty offices during office hours unless accompanied by guardians, or unless they'd signed the right form with the right initials in the right boxes. The letter was careful not to say what it meant; it included words like liability and precedent the way people include parsley. Dr. M held it as if it might bite and then smiled with an anatomy that had to be practiced. She wrote in the margin, with less cruelty than wit: there is always a form for asking people to stop being inconveniently human. Then, because she had promised herself to practice risk, she emailed the dean and asked for a meeting and brought Pilar\u2019s mother a loaf of bread that had cost more than it ought to and tasted like competence.\n\nThe dean\u2019s office had a carpet that had been vacuumed brave and a window onto a view of a tree that had been planted with a ceremony neither of them had attended. The dean, a man who liked to push his glasses up his nose even when they had not slipped, explained the policy with a good faith he had inherited. He did not want a town to spill into his building and he did not want to be the one who had said no to a child and he did not like the mess of both. \u201cWe are trying to be consistent,\u201d he said, and Dr. M, who had spent the morning grading narratives, almost said there is no such thing and did not. She said instead, \u201cConsistency is a beautiful lie when it\u2019s not laid over people,\u201d and watched him grimace the way men do when a metaphor knocks politely at their doctrine. They compromised in the way people do when they can be seen; Pilar could come if Dr. M kept her door open and if Pilar\u2019s mother signed a permission that used the word mentoring too often and never once said collecting. Outside, the tree did its inexpensive miracle of budding, despite forms.\n\nThe fairgrounds became a winter ghost and then decided suddenly to be a church again for a day. The town declared a drive for coats and then discovered it had no place to put the line of coats it had conjured, and Albert kept the back of his truck open like a trough and laughed once all day in a way that made people hand him quarters for the laundromat even though he had not asked. Blue appeared on the chain of the gate that had always caught a boy\u2019s sleeve and made him cry and then grow a callus there he would not understand until he was a man. The word was small and precise: OPEN, written on a link as if it were a dare. A child with wrists still made for bracelets traced it and asked his mother what it meant to open a thing and not be sure what would come in. She said, \u201cWe find out,\u201d and the blue on the gate glowed as if proud of having assigned homework to the universe.\n\nThe Eppley woman showed up at Browbeat with a haircut that suggested she had remembered her head was made for weather. People had stopped booing her even in private and started letting her tell the part of the story where she had sat in the diner and cried because jobs sometimes turn you into a noun you did not meant to be. She read a small essay with the steadiness of someone admitting hand tremors, about the day she had introduced the solvent to her own reflection for five seconds and then wiped it off her own forehead for twice that long and how she had hated herself for wanting to see if the world would be nicer to her if she complied. The room made a hush that had learned respect without applause. After, a chemist from down the block who had been quietly in love with molecules since he had blown up a lima bean in fifth grade came and said, \u201cIt matters that you also want to make people\u2019s skin not itch,\u201d and she looked at him like she might someday allow herself to be forgiven in public.\n\nOn the other side of town, under the overpass where pigeons wrote their own laws, a boy named Jai\u2014with a jaw like a decision and eyebrows that had faded to a blue the shade of history\u2014skated the same four-foot stretch of concrete until it bore a small groove only wheels know. He loved the giant the way you love an aunt you see at barbecues who tells you one sentence that saves a summer. He had a father who said the word man in different fonts and a mother who boiled tea and called it medicine because that made the day behave better. He had saved up for a new deck and then given the money to a friend who had not asked and he felt ridiculous about it with a righteousness nobody had taught him to recognize as holy. The blue found his board one evening when he had left it leaning crooked against a pillar, and when he came back in the morning his grip was a galaxy of flecks you could not sand off without turning the wood into dust. He ran his hand across it and said, \u201cOkay,\u201d to the wrong deity, and the pigeons shifted their commentary.\n\nDr. M began to catch herself using the word we in sentences where she had previously reserved the pronoun for friends and essays. \u201cWe have to assume the blue will outlast our good intentions,\u201d she said in class, chalk dust careless on cuff and wrist, and the students nodded as if this were a civic fact like taxes. The boy with the guitar fingers wrote a poem so guileless it took her breath and then put it in her hand as if asking for permission to keep it. A girl whose eyebrows had never acquired pigment made a collage of mirrors and wrote an artist\u2019s statement where she confessed, with mean genius, that sometimes she wanted blue just to shut people up about choice. The kids were fine half the time and half the time were the kind of heroic that requires an intermission, and Dr. M, who had worn her patience like a cardigan for decades, discovered a muscle under it that had not been used since her own ridiculous twenties.\n\nIn March, as if in apology for having been predictably cruel, the state sent money. You cannot mark a town and then not expect a grant to arrive. The money came in a bundle tied with the kind of reports that smell like the inside of a filing cabinet and it had stipulations that \u2014 like all stipulations \u2014 had learned to sit with their legs apart. The city councilman with the two-sided mouth licked his finger and turned the pages and said, in a tone that wanted to be generous, \u201cWe can fund mentorships,\u201d and the art teacher said, \u201cWe\u2019re already mentoring,\u201d and the nurse said, \u201cThe NICU needs chairs,\u201d and the sheriff said nothing at all because he had discovered that silence was sometimes cheaper than regret. They formed another committee because even attention has to justify itself to square tables; it met in the old Elks Lodge where the wallpaper had given up arguing with time. Someone had the good sense to call it a mutual aid fund and someone else had the sense to make it universal enough not to turn need into application, and a woman who had taught Sunday school for thirty years wrote on the whiteboard the only line that got applause: an emergency is when we hear each other faster.\n\nLynette moved decidedly through the part of town where stories go to nap: the long rectangle of self-storage where divorces and Christmas live together and do not admit it. She wrote on one door, with thrift and the steady hand of someone who has practiced not apologizing, the word SAVED, and it looked like an error until you saw the next door, which wore the word LEFT, and the next: FOR. A man stopping to pay a late fee read all three and called his sister in Decatur because there are moments you cannot carry unshared. Dr. M stood on the little break in the curb and watched this grammar be installed like a chandelier in the open air, and thought of the way a sentence rearranges a day. She put her finger on her own wrist and felt the old pulse and thought: risk.\n\nThe teenage boys with nets, now city employees with vests that permitted them to be ridiculous in sanctioned ways, pivoted to helpfulness with a professionalism that would have made their mothers proud if their mothers had been the kind to be impressed by municipal grace. They closed a street during a parade without making it worse. They lifted a too-low wire and learned how to hold their arms not like conquest but like invitation. One of them\u2014Cooper, freckles like arguments on his nose\u2014told Dr. M during a pause where faux-perimeter became leaning and listening that he had thought he was going to be the guy who caught her and now he was the guy who kept kids from walking backward into poles. She said, \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d without patronizing him, and he let himself be told; there are ways to be useful that do not sparkle on r\u00e9sum\u00e9s that still feed a city.\n\nAt the library, the board approved, by an oldest-people-voice vote, the creation of a special collection labeled Ephemera of the Blue Movement, and the librarian with the pencil in her hair wrote a list that began with \u201cphotocopies of nothing\u201d and ended with \u201cmemories people think they lost.\u201d They collected solvent pamphlets and Browbeat flyers and an embroidery someone\u2019s grandma had made of a blue eyebrow that looked, accidentally, like a bird. They put the pillowcase with the handprint in a glass case without putting a name on it and everyone in town knew and didn\u2019t, and Pilar dragged three of her friends to see and whispered, \u201cThat\u2019s hers,\u201d with the pride we take in other people\u2019s myth. Dr. M stood at the back with her hands in the jacket she should have retired two winters ago and allowed herself to feel ceremonial in a way that did not require a podium.\n\nA rumor insisted on brandishing consequences. It said a legislator from the north had drafted a bill with a name that balanced badly on its shoes\u2014Public Visual Integrity Statute\u2014and that it would fine municipalities that failed to remove unsolicited pigment from municipal property within seventy-two hours. It listed clarifications that contradicted themselves like haste, including a clause about safety markings and a clause about religious exemptions and a clause about signage for the illiterate that made people argue in grocery aisles in front of endcaps. The hearing happened in a room with leather chairs that had been sat in by men who like to be told when they are right, and the bill hiccuped and did not pass that day because a janitor had taped her own handwritten sign to the back of the door: TAKE YOUR GARBAGE WITH YOU, and someone took a picture and it had eyebrows and millions of people liked it. The legislator went on the radio and said no one understands the costs of graffiti abatement and the radio man said you should come to our town and meet HELD and the legislator did not laugh and the radio man did because laughing had become, for him, survival.\n\nThe verbs adjusted. What had been enough in December shifted to tend in March, and a new one, quiet as a cat, crept in around the edges of Lynette\u2019s steady drum. It said teach, in a whisper that did not carry chalk dust and did not end in a test. She started, without meaning to look like a schedule, showing up near places where new people were trying to keep breathing: citizenship classes at the Y, the diner on the night shift when first-day waitresses burned pancakes, the rooms at the shelter where rules were recited like spells and broken like bread. At the citizenship class she put a neat bar of blue above the coat hook, just where a hand reaches up without thinking; a woman from Eritrea looked at it and laughed the way her mother had, and passed the test three days later, and the blue faded but not in her wrist. At the diner she marked the coffee machine, ridiculous and perfect, and the night shift got thirty cents\u2019 more respect on average for a week; the girls rang it up as free pie and called it rumor.\n\nApril arrived like an apology with a bouquet. The forsythia inched toward its annual shout. The sky learned to be big again without being scolding. The high school put on a spring play with limited budget and infinite willingness, and the kids painted eyebrows on the cardboard cityscape because the town had them and because they were funny and because their teacher had said yes more than was wise. The sheriff played the mayor onstage and took direction with the forlorn humility of men who are more used to giving it, and at one point his hat fell off and the blue on his fingers flicked forward and clapped before he could stop them. People laughed and then remembered to let the laughter grow into something gentler. In the wings, a boy cried without making noise and a girl handed him the sleeve of her sweater and went back on to deliver a line about taxes as if everything were under control.\n\nPilar had a fight with her mother that contained both of their grandmothers, as good fights do, and then showed up at Dr. M\u2019s door with a bag of Gushers and an apology and a question. \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll ever stop on her own,\u201d she asked, meaning both Lynette and her mother and not meaning herself. Dr. M sat her at the table where the plant had at last made peace with its own lackluster window and said, \u201cPeople stop doing things all the time without doing worse things instead,\u201d and Pilar said, \u201cThat is not how anyone in my family acts,\u201d and they laughed, relieved to have named a truth that would not punish them for its accuracy. They sorted the Gushers by color as if deciding a canon. Dr. M said, \u201cDo you want to ask her for something,\u201d and Pilar said, \u201cI want her to write on the door to the bathroom at school the word safe where the seniors like to say curse words about freshmen,\u201d and the way she said safe made the air trip, and two days later, on a Tuesday that rained one street at a time, the word appeared on the underside of the stall, where a girl\u2019s head goes when she hides. It was small and just this side of prim. It was a promise made in block letters and tile.\n\nThere were, because there always are, people who were impatient with what cannot be monetized. A developer tried to fold the blue into a marketing deck for a new cluster of condos that called itself by the name of a prairie that had been eaten to build them and featured a mock-up with tastefully blue eyebrows on the residents in the rendering. The town laughed in the exhausted way of people who have seen worse ideas pass with ribbons on. The developer took down the slide and offered to fund a youth center and everyone clapped because two things can be true and one of them can be money. The youth center painted its skate ramp blue because the boy named Jai had volunteered to teach a kid to drop in without breaking, and the kid did and did not and everyone cheered and a nurse in the audience held her breath like a prayer and then let it out when the boy stood and called his mom instead of trying to be brave without.\n\nOne evening, at the end of a day that had worn its light like a good ring, Dr. M walked the path by the river with Farouq and listened to him tell a story that seemed to be about a girl and was about everything else too. He had learned to love in public with the caution of a person who had been taught to be entertaining first, and she watched him move the furniture back in his own heart so there would be space for a guest to sit without bumping a shin. He said, \u201cI used to think wanting to be chosen was a weakness and now I think it\u2019s a curriculum,\u201d and she said, \u201cYou\u2019re late to your own party,\u201d and he said, \u201cAt least I brought ice,\u201d and they grinned like people trying. They stopped near the place where the giant liked to pause, just long enough to let the verbs in her chest agree on a chorus, and the wind moved their hair like a small supervision. They did not bother to look up to see if she was there; they knew the signs when their bodies stopped performing and started noticing.\n\nThe radiators in the town had adopted a new program. They behaved. They breathed, they did not cough. Even the one in Dr. M\u2019s apartment that had staged operettas all winter learned to hum like a discreet friend. On a night when the frogs in the retention pond across from the cemetery found sudden confidence, Dr. M woke to the exact sound of her own name said kindly and then realized it had been the radiator\u2019s particular talk and laughed in the dark at the way humans wish to be invited to their own sleep. She rolled over and put her hand on the pillowcase with the handprint and did not feel sentimental, just located. In the morning she went to the jail not because anything was scheduled but because sometimes you visit the word you admire. HELD was the same color it had been when it arrived and not; a thousand eyes had touched it and that kind of attention becomes a patina. A woman standing near it with a purse that had been patched three times put her hand on the concrete next to the word and said, to the air, to the building, to her own blood, \u201cI can wait,\u201d and the verbs in Lynette\u2019s chest made a sound like recognition.\n\nAt the foster office, KEPT got a cousin. Someone, giant or not, put above the cot in the visiting room the word RETURNED in a blue so quiet you would only see it after an hour, and a child who had learned that all rooms can be modified sat under it and played with a broken truck and glanced up just once to make sure the word was still there. At the methadone clinic, the nurse with gravel added to the whiteboard in the break room a new rule that scrolled like a poem: drink water, eat something with protein, tell someone a silly story, read the word on the doorframe when you think you are the only person who has ever felt like this, make the bed because a future is coming and will need a place to sit. The staff laughed and then did it because leadership is sometimes a request at the right volume.\n\nIf there was a climax, it declined to be photogenic. It arrived on a Thursday with the ordinary cruelty of a student admitting to plagiarism and a truck breaking down on Neil Street and a grandmother losing the list she had written for her grandson and then remembering it item by item like a conjurer. A boy in a hoodie with the wrong logo went downtown with a marker he had not bought to write over HELD because a man on the internet whose face he\u2019d never seen had dared him in a way that made him feel brave. He stood with his hand and the marker and the concrete and the word and an intention he had rehearsed since noon, and the blue did not flare and Lynette did not appear and the sheriff did not call out and no one told him he was a villain or a hero. He lifted his hand and wrote in a teenager\u2019s hurried hand one letter and then another, and when he was done, on the other side of HELD, in black that would fade before the blue did, was the word LAUGHED. The boy stepped back and swallowed his own motive and started to cry and then stopped because crying in public is an ocean. Dr. M, who had rounded the corner holding a coffee she did not yet regret, stood with him without speaking because shutting up is the hardest part of witness. He told her his name like a dare and she told him her job and he looked disappointed and then relieved. Together they stood and let the words sit beside each other without choosing which one was supposed to win. Years later people would argue about whether LAUGHED was vandalism or a companion and the best arguments would end with cake.\n\nMay forgot to ask permission and arrived. The town shed its coats like statements it no longer had to make. The blue did not leave because seasons are not contracts and love is not obliged to obey the solstice. The bandstand hosted graduations that made people think about their hands and about forms and about lines, and a dozen boys with blue eyebrows did their best to look blas\u00e9 and failed beautifully. The Eppley woman wore a dress like a successful apology and sat with the chemist and held hands out of sequence with the music because people in love do not always keep time. Albert taught a kid how to secure a tarp with rope squarely and said a sentence to the effect of if you learn to tie things you will never feel quite as lost. Pilar brought a disposable camera to the fair and took photos of things in between things, the kind that Instagram cannot metabolize, and taped one to Dr. M\u2019s door where two hands almost touched and did not make a masterpiece and did make the day easier.\n\nIn the slow, reliable crisis of summer, when everything gets too much and people forget they get to sit, Lynette did something so ridiculous the town retained it without trying: she lay in the shallows of the river and let the kids climb her arm like a diving board. She did not let them dive. She said, in her way that bypassed ears, we do not turn love into danger just because the light is pretty, and the kids rolled their eyes because kids understand cynicism as religion and then lined up and jumped anyway into the shallow water with their knees up to their chests and their hands pinched on their noses, harmless as joy. A mother with her hair up to keep it from clinging to her neck cried behind her sunglasses in the accurate way of women finally given a rest for three minutes. Dr. M sat on the grass and wrote nothing down and ate a sandwich she had wrapped like a treasure, which is to say: she let herself be audience and not archive.\n\nAt dusk, with mosquitoes that had not learned boundaries and a sky that could not help showing off in pinks that would be despised if they were sweaters, the verbs in the giant\u2019s chest found a new harmony. It said stay as invitation and not demand. It said go as permission and not exile. It said learn like a door ajar and not as a chore list taped to the fridge. It said enough and meant not the end but the feast. Dr. M stood because she had sat long enough and because standing is one way to tell your body you intend to keep it. She put her hand on the trunk of a tree that had not done anything particularly poetical in a decade and felt a rhythm under the bark that people who call themselves scientists forget to put on charts. It was not a miracle. It was a town that had been leaned on and had not fallen and had decided, in that inexplicable way human places do, to teach itself how to hold.\n\nWhen she went home, the radiator did not sing but she did. She sang, badly and only two lines of a song she had known at eight, without thinking what music meant and without thinking about the neighbors above with their small feet and large opinions. The pillowcase lay on her bed like a map addressed to her. She wrote on an envelope, which had stand in for decisions admirably all winter, the words Chapter Ten ends badly if I try to make it useful, and then crossed out ends and wrote begins. In the morning she would make coffee and ask the kids to tell her everything she had forgotten, and they would and they would not, and she would write it down and leave some of it alone. The plant had put out a new leaf the size of a coin and did not apologize. Outside, the town rehearsed breathing, and under the telephone wires that had learned manners, a giant put her hand on the roof of the laundromat with the corkboard and the missing sock and the jar of quarters and remembered the names she carries out loud until they were not only hers to hold.",
