     "novel_text": "The night before the river ran backward, I sorted bottles by the glow of my kitchen lamp and the murmur of the Oswego beyond my window. Clear to clear, brown to brown, green into the green crate I\u2019d painted with a hand-lettered REUSE, the you curling like a fishhook. In Fulton, glass still has a decent chance of being reborn into something that won\u2019t break under winter\u2019s shoulder. Plastics\u2014I hate plastics\u2014went into their purgatory bin, labels peeled and caps saved for the boy down on Thirteenth who collects them for his art. Metal, paper, cardboard cut down to neat rectangles stacked under the sink like stale wedding cake. I order things. It\u2019s what I do. Bring the frayed back to the hem. Persuade the cycles to keep turning.\n\nMy name is June Weaver. My mother says it was a lazy prophecy, naming a witch Weaver, but she was the sort who would drop a fortune on cunning and pick up foresight at a discount, so I forgive her. I make my living doing small repairs and larger ones, with needle and soldering iron, with nettle tea and murmured words, with alleyway whispers and the soft rasp of a file on a jagged edge. There\u2019s a sign over my storefront on Oneida Street that reads Stitch & Solder, and most nights it twitches in the lake wind like a bird trying to settle in a questionable tree. If you come in with a broken heirloom locket, I can make it speak. If you bring me a toaster with a ghost in it, I\u2019ll coax the specter out and into a crystal from the riverbed, where its haunting can be admired without burning your bread. I keep needles threaded in blood-red and dull gold, and a jar of greying parsley by the window for luck. I have a particular set of skills: to find what\u2019s been misplaced, to bind what\u2019s fallen apart, to coax electricity to behave like a good dog, to hear the creek under the tar of a road and call it by its old name until it answers.\n\nOutside, on the long spinal street of Fulton, the bins were lined up like a makeshift parade\u2014blue, green, open-topped with their indifferent newspapers and bottle necks. The city would swing by in the morning. The bins are not the real work; the real work is in the habit, the choice, the tiny decision repeated until it becomes a story you live inside. I rinsed my bottles and set them down easy. A habit is a spell with a longer fuse.\n\nI slept badly that night, full of the hum of machines left too long in my shop and the churn of river ice. Sometime around two or three, there was a sound. A crackle\u2014paper. A movement\u2014plastic bags talking to themselves. I have no cat. I got up. My building does this thing in winter where it keeps one foot in summer. Heat rises and doesn\u2019t settle, like bad gossip. In the kitchen my breath didn\u2019t bloom. The window over the sink was dark with river and the streetlamp across the way smeared with a fog that had been kind enough not to be a storm.\n\nUnder the light in my kitchen, a ribbon of smoke threaded like ink. Not fire-smoke, exactly. More like the artificial sweet of heated plastic, like the inside of a toy caught in a radiator. Scan the brain: stove off, kettle cool, iron unplugged. The bins. I went barefoot, toes cracking against the cold linoleum, and down the hallway, my nightgown a puddle of dark. I took the key from the hook where I keep the key and opened the back door and stepped into the star\u2019s breath.\n\nThe bins were tipped, the contents of my careful evening tossed like entrails. A mountain of newspaper slurry collapsed into the slick on the alley. The plastic bin had been folded cruelly, and there was a scorch mark on the rim that would not come out in the morning. The lids lay like petrified hats. Someone had scrawled with black marker on my green crate: who are you saving. No question mark. There were three cigarette butts ground into the wet cardboard as if they were answering.\n\nI am not quick to anger. That\u2019s not virtue. That\u2019s practice. There are protections in my house that are not dramatic. Salt at the thresholds, iron under the rugs, a mirror turned face-down under the bed to catch nightmares like flies. I squatted in the silk pajamas my aunt Sable had sent me from New Orleans and touched the scorch mark with my fingertips. My skin prickled. The shape was not random; it was a sigil, clumsy, the kind you get when someone copies a drawing without believing in it. A triangle with a broken line through the base. I know the opacity of a triangle. This one leaked. My lips remembered the taste of black smoke, and I swallowed admiration with the cold in my throat.\n\n\u201cKeep your rituals to your church, June?\u201d The voice came from the alley\u2019s mouth, and it was a familiar ache. Eloise Tan, city councilwoman and veteran of fights you don\u2019t know are fights until you have lost them. She had on a parka I recognized, the one with the mended cuff I\u2019d done for her last winter that had survived a campaign and a freeze. Her hair was veiled in a hood trimmed in what looked like the fur of a white fox that had never seen blood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my kitchen,\u201d I said, soft to not wake the neighbors. \u201cAnyway my church is the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery pagan,\u201d she said. She stepped into the alley like a detective in a TV show I used to watch with my mother, one of those where the moral is always: the city is a beast, but if you ride it right it can be a horse. She crouched next to me, sniffed like she didn\u2019t trust me to be honest about the chemical recipe in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you. Grahams down the block, Conklin\u2019s pizza\u2014Etta said she found her compost slashed.\u201d\n\nEtta runs the co-op with a ferocity that makes you happy she uses it to feed people. Etta could fling a tomato like a grenade and you\u2019d consent to be blown up.\n\n\u201cKids?\u201d I offered, though it didn\u2019t feel like kids. I\u2019ve been a kid; I know the shape of kid acts. There is a pattern then, even in chaos, and the pattern tends toward the myth of yourself you\u2019re trying to coax from the world.\n\n\u201cKids don\u2019t leave runes,\u201d Eloise said, pointing with a gloved finger at the triangle. \u201cThat\u2019s cult nonsense.\u201d\n\nWitch, cult, church. We keep repackaging the same boxes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d I said, and I meant the mark, the mess, the thing that had made both.\n\nEloise sighed. \u201cI keep fighting to keep the glass program, June. If people see this, they\u2019ll say, cut it. They\u2019ll say, you\u2019re feeding a thing that doesn\u2019t want to be fed. The city is tired. The budget is the vampire we sleep with.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be the one who worries about monsters,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d she said, and gave me a look like a blessing. \u201cAnd June?\u201d\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe lock your bins.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext I\u2019ll put a gate on the river,\u201d I said. Eloise huffed a laugh that sifted into the fog and went about her business of saving what could be saved with policy and indomitable hair.\n\nI cleaned the alley in a nightgown and the stubbornness of a woman who doesn\u2019t like being messed with. As I sorted, the smoke smell faded, as if embarrassed. I took the marker and wrote under the who are you saving: you. Myself. The gulls. All of us. A little petty, perhaps, but sometimes a witch writing an answer is a hex. Sometimes the hex is a way to feel less small.\n\nMorning in Fulton is a blue that doesn\u2019t belong to any sky more than to water. The river collects color like stories and then tells them back. The city woke. Buses snarled. A man in a tan coat that had been tan twenty years ago yelled into a phone about unions. A baby in a stroller looked at me like I was both safer and more dangerous than her mother would allow. I opened my shop as the clock over the library chimed nine, the sound too church for my taste but nice in winter when your bones look for a reason to stand. Stitch & Solder smells like wool and something like cinnamon but isn\u2019t. I flipped the sign to open and the bell chimed like a coin dropping into a well.\n\nAunt Sable called as I was untangling the bracelets from the dollhouse chandelier that had been brought in by a woman who wanted to use it as a lamp for her cat\u2019s birthday party. \u201cJune-bug,\u201d she sang. \u201cThe river told me to call you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe river has my number,\u201d I said. \u201cRoutine complaint or emergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tease your old aunt. This is serious. There\u2019s a shadow around your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cA signature? Or a literal atmospheric anomaly?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get clever. It\u2019s the kind of shadow that burns in photographs. I can see the singe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, and I told her about the bins. Why does telling a person who loves you always make things worse? Because then it becomes haunted twice. Once by the thing. Once by their fear.\n\nSable hissed\u2014a sound like steam, like the river when it breaks free from a culvert. \u201cChild. You staying in? You grounding?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy feet are on the floor, Auntie.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your clever mouth run ahead of you. There\u2019s a witch in the county who\u2019s been burning. I\u2019ve felt it in the mails. They don\u2019t recycle. They aren\u2019t reusing anything. Using. Used. Do you understand me?\u201d She got sharp when the world got messy. She had spent her youth cleaning up messes made by men with more money than magic. Now she sits on her porch and reads the weather for people who never say please.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t recycle,\u201d I repeated, and felt something like laughter and nausea. \u201cHow do you not recycle?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou throw everything away,\u201d she said darkly. \u201cEven if it\u2019s yourself.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the morning was work. A silver whistle with a cracked reed. A quilt mended from five generations of shirts. A radio with a voice that belonged to a woman whose husband had died on a Tuesday and never found the body; the woman\u2019s voice had gotten stuck in the weather band, announcing rain when it was sunny, whispering the humidity like a secret. I set the radio on the counter and hummed to it and put my palm on its back as if it had a fever. It was a two-hour negotiation, and in the end the woman left the radio lighter and I sent the hitchhiking voice into a blue marble. The marble rolled to the wall and now holds an invisible weather system. I like to think her husband knows where he is, even if he doesn\u2019t.\n\nAt noon Etta burst in. \u201cYou heard?\u201d she said, not waiting for my no. \u201cThe t-shirt printer on Second? Their bins were set on fire. Actual fire. They had to call the men in hats, and now the hats want to know if it\u2019s us.\u201d\n\n\u201cUs?\u201d I said, though I knew who she meant and she knew I knew she knew.\n\n\u201cWitches. He used the \u2018w\u2019 word. In a way that says he\u2019s watched a lot of YouTube.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of explaining to people that the witchy things they hate are the things you do in your kitchen when you sing to the bread and swear at the roast because it burned but then you cut off the black and say it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreaching to the choir,\u201d Etta snapped. She set a brown paper bag on my counter with a thump. \u201cHere. Lunch. Don\u2019t you argue.\u201d\n\nIt was chili that smelled like it had made peace with onions. I warmed it on the hot plate with a grudge and ate it leaning against the counter because if I sat down I would stay down and the day would roll me like a log.\n\nThe rumor swelled. The internet managed to tangle itself into knots of moral clarity and conspiracy like a cat in long curtains. I ignored it on purpose for an hour. Then two. The third hour the fog stepped inside my shop like an uninvited relative and sat down on my stool. The bell over my door chimed again and there was a man whose soft wool hat was damp all the way through. He had eyes that knew the river in a way I didn\u2019t, which is saying something. I know it by smell\u2014mineral and fish, copper pennies and the underskirt of algae. He knew it by the way a current draws a body and how long things float.\n\n\u201cJune,\u201d he said, and did not offer a hand as if this was not that kind of visit. \u201cYou better come.\u201d\n\n\u201cGideon,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not my ancestor I don\u2019t know who is.\u201d Gideon runs the fire boat. He fishes the ones the river takes when it decides. He finds cars that have thought being water would be gentler than being road. He wears his grief like a coat he washed in cold water and then ironed because that\u2019s what you do with sorrow; you make it presentable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gull,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a message.\u201d\n\nI locked the shop with a chalk line like a smile over the door. Gideon and I walked the slope toward the river that made the town and in exchange asked that we handle vigilance like devotion. The river in winter is a lozenge. Bitter, medicinal. It sits. It waits. On the tattered ice near the old Nestl\u00e9 plant\u2014dead and done with sweetness decades ago\u2014lay a gull. The gull was dead in a way that suggested it had been dead for some time, and also in a way that suggested it had been set where it was. Someone had wanted it found. Its belly was split. It was full of plastic. You hear about this. You don\u2019t see it. I didn\u2019t want to. Bottle caps like candy, a lighter, a comb, a tiny child\u2019s barrette shaped like a bow that I recognized because I had sold three of them to a woman who had said they were for her niece\u2019s dolls. Its eyes were soft and its beak was rung with a black ring of ash.\n\nOn the ice beside the bird was the same sigil as on my bin.\n\n\u201cCould be kids,\u201d Gideon said, in the tone of a man who knows it could be worse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He tucked his hands into his coat and watched the sky with a sensitivity animals know. \u201cThere\u2019s talk about a witch. The city is full of talk. She doesn\u2019t recycle.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t recycle,\u201d I repeated, but the words came out with a different weight the second time. A person who takes what works from the world and doesn\u2019t return the favor. A person who floods the cycle with noise.\n\n\u201cYou going to find her?\u201d Gideon asked softly.\n\n\u201cI have a particular set of skills,\u201d I said, and the sentence sounded like a joke only to people who had not seen me unsnap a curse from a doorknob or coax a laugh out of a grieving coffee cup that had belonged to someone\u2019s father too long.\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, but his voice said: be careful of yourself.\n\nThe rumor had a shape now. A triangle with a broken base. A burner. The Black Bag Witch. The one who says: throw it in the trash, who says: it doesn\u2019t matter, who says: sort your hopes, if you like, but please let me have this flame.\n\nI started at the transfer station. I picked up cans with a stick and tipped over boxes that smelled like a garden that had lost its name. Nate who runs the place knows me by my temper. \u201cJune,\u201d he said with a grin like a railroad crossing. \u201cForget your gloves again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to feel what I\u2019m feeling,\u201d I said, and he snorted. He set me up with a vest the color of taxicabs and a pair of gloves that made my fingers feel like they were trying to read in mittens.\n\nI walked the lines. Left a thread of myself behind like a spinning spider. I call it thread-sense, not because I\u2019m pretty about it but because words matter. I can track a person by the way they handle a jar. The way they fold paper. The way they crumple. The way their energy sits in the discard. On the third day and the fifth hour and the eighth pile of mis-sorted plastic, I found a whorl of something that made my mouth taste like pennies. Hot, careless. The sigil again, drawn on a takeout lid with the grease from meat not from this county. Something of mine caught in the grease\u2014hair? No. The echo of a flavor I had eaten once and said, never again.\n\nI followed the thread out of the station and into the brownfield behind the old Hannibal mill where the grass grows tempted then bitter. You know an abandoned place by the way it remembers us without flattery. The fence had been cut by hands that knew how to cut fences with a cutter bought at a store where the clerk had looked away on purpose. Inside what might have been a warehouse or a school gym once a long time ago, a space spread out like a mouth remembering how to laugh. The floor was silt and bird droppings and broken bottles half-sunk like teeth. Someone had drawn the sigil on the chalky wall over and over, nervous scribbles that got cleaner as they went. And there was my jar of greying parsley, the one from my window, and I had not put it there.\n\nSable says the problem with old mills is they are hungry. They gorge on labor for decades and then when you stop feeding them they bite your hand. The mill\u2019s hunger looked like a drift of plastic bags collected in a corner and humming a little in that way that only people like me hear. I could taste the burn on the back of my tongue. There were cigarette butts in a cracked sink; lipstick stains on the paper of a cheap cup. A black bag ripped. I crouched by the parsley\u2014which had been emptied onto the floor in a shock of grey leaves like hair\u2014and touched the jar\u2019s lip. My fingerprints there, old. My print on a print. A mirror of me was here or had been here or had used my things.\n\nI left the mill like a thief. The thread-sense went with me, stitched through my coat, bound to my ribs. I slept that night like I\u2019d been set on a slow river that sometimes goes under and becomes a different river entirely.\n\nFulton is kind to stalls that sell hot sugar on sticks and fresh donuts the size of small boats. If you want a mark, you do it on a day when the whole town smells like something from an old calendar. The Green Days fair down by the lock is supposed to be merry. There are tables with pamphlets so earnest they wear a blush. There is a man with a beard so monumental it might be a monument to beards, and he has a machine that turns old t-shirts into yarn and the yarn into hats and the hats into compliments for babies. There are students with bright eyes who say: compost numbers! And there is one of those bikes you pedal to make a blender spin, and the children get to be blenders. Etta had a booth that could have been a barricade. Gideon had photographs of the river that were so beautiful you wanted to die and be water.\n\nI had a table with a bowl of single earrings that I\u2019d coaxed into pairs. A pot of herbs for exchange. A sign that read Free Mendings. A little line formed and stayed like weather. I sewed a button back on a coat. I unpicked the hem of a memory and pressed it open with spit and thumbs and a charm for flattening the past enough to step on. I smiled until my lips felt like local celebrities.\n\nAt one, the wind changed. These are the things you notice when your blood knows the angle of the light. It shifted from south to east, bringing with it the genius of a factory that no longer exists. People went closed, like clams. The smell sharpened. And then the bins by the municipal table\u2014overflowing with the good intention of a thousand sample cups\u2014flared. A flame like a tongue licked up, rolled, doubled itself like a jellyfish and kept going. There was a scatter and a shout. Someone threw a bucket at the fire, which is not a sentence so much as a confession. Water pleased the plastic for a second and then made it furious.\n\n\u201cExtinguisher!\u201d Etta roared, and someone obeyed her who had never before obeyed a woman. The extinguisher coughed and the white smother fell and the fire made its thin cry and settled into a smear of shame.\n\nOn the white, in the outline, the sigil. This would have been a time to run for the person doing it. This would have been a time to say: witch-hunt, in a tone that meant, we already know how this goes. Instead I stood still, held in place by a tug somewhere in the meat of my shoulder. My shoulder aches when a hurricane is thinking about my town. It also aches when I have done something I don\u2019t want to admit to myself yet.\n\n\u201cJune.\u201d Eloise\u2019s voice had the tremor in it reserved for conversations about budgets and the deaths of good ideas. \u201cWe cannot afford this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d I said. The wind made a half-hearted attempt at playing with my hair and gave up. I tasted sugar. Melted plastic. The ghost of a carnival. I tugged my thread-sense and it snapped tight as if something had taken hold of the line and was playing. A pull; I staggered like a fish. An answer to a question I had asked in no language anyone taught me. It pulled north, toward the old Nestl\u00e9, toward the river\u2019s one man-made apostasy.\n\nI excused myself the way you excuse yourself from your own party when you remember there is a pan in the oven that was never in the oven to begin with. My feet were sure. Why not? They knew where I have gone in the night I\u2019m not allowed to own yet.\n\nThe factory is a carcass. Everyone says that. They say it as if the V of broken windows can\u2019t bite still. The smell of milk is gone, but in summer if you stand in the right place, sweet ghost. I walked past the No Trespassing sign with the humility of someone who obeys signs but not this one. Inside, in the place where chocolate used to be poured like prayer, someone had spelled out words with plastic cutlery. We don\u2019t recycle, they had written, which was both a statement and a threat. A heap of black bags sat like a dragon hid its wealth and went cheap.\n\nI should have called someone. That is the thing that reasonable women who are tired of mopping up after unreasonable things do. Call Gideon or Eloise or Nate or even the man with the mountain of beard and the yarn machine. Instead I put my hand on the nearest bag and felt heat. Not heat from flame. Heat from hands. Hands that had been mine, at least recently. Again the penny taste. Again the thread pulling. I took a breath and tugged. The world turned.\n\nWhen I woke up, the light was the white-out of afternoons that have decided to be evenings against advice. My hands were gritty. Under my nails: grey. Ash. My pockets slick with something sweet. A smear of black on my jaw that smelled like a lollipop had had a bad idea. The heap of bags had been rearranged while I was asleep or while I was someone else. The cutlery words had been scrambled to an arrangement that made less sense but spoke to me anyway. Ecycle. Leryc. Cry. I wiped my mouth and tasted sugar and something burned. I had lost an hour or a day. Time is a substance too; you can deprive yourself of it, and then it discovers ways to deprive you in return.\n\nOn the floor someone had drawn the sigil once more. And beside it, the mark I put on things I have made so that I can find them by feel in the dark. I have put that mark on a hundred mends, tucked into seams like a whisper. I have never drawn it where anyone can see. My stomach dropped. My mark and the triangle sharing a wall like neighbors who have started to borrow sugar and then borrow other things and then one day they borrow the other\u2019s name and no one can tell whose it was to begin with.\n\nI wandered home with my coat open and my mind shut. The night was hungry and my house was both a shelter and a witness. I scrubbed the smear off my face and it came off too easily. I put the parsley jar back without speaking to it. I opened the drawer where I keep the good salts and I put a line around my bed so thick it might have stopped a river, and then I stepped over it like I was a teenager and the salt was a rule. Sleep came. Sleep went. There were dreams, but they were like rooms without switches.\n\nThe next day I ate toast at Etta\u2019s because if I made my own I would teach the bread something I did not want it to know about me. I listened as people spoke in the same tone about the weather and the economy and the witch as if all three were connected and also none of them could be solved. Pastor Lennox came in and didn\u2019t order anything and Etta gave him coffee anyway because she is more gracious than he deserves and because grace is cheaper flavoured when the person receiving it needs it. He looked at me like I was a problem he had not yet invented a sermon for. He touched his tie pin with a rhythm people who do not pray cannot hear.\n\n\u201cYou going to the council meeting?\u201d Eloise asked, sliding into the booth like she was an extra person in my life preserver. \u201cThey want to vote on cutting glass, June. They say the fire makes it look bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand up. I\u2019ll speak,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll mend.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and then, almost not letting herself, \u201cBe careful.\u201d She meant: be careful not to make it worse.\n\nAt the meeting there was shouting. There are two kinds of shouting: the kind that gets things moving, and the kind that lights a match. We had both. Men who had never sorted a bag of anything in their lives said words like personal responsibility. Women who have sorted their families for decades said words like community and tired. My mouth tasted like sheet cake and shame. Eloise held the line. Gideon spoke once only, and the room got quiet. He said: I pull the river\u2019s dead out, do not make me pull out your hope. It was melodrama and it worked because it was true.\n\nThen a woman stood up with a flyer. It was a flyer I had made last spring, for a repair night at my shop. I recognize my own italics. The sigil had been sketched in in pencil, like a mustache on a portrait. Underneath, the writing: save your scraps for the witch. My handwriting. My pen. The same curl on my y\u2019s that Aunt Sable teases me about. I stood. Sat. A weird low note was stuck in my chest and it didn\u2019t belong to a song.\n\n\u201cJune?\u201d Eloise said under her breath, grim as tax. \u201cIs that\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cA copy,\u201d I said. \u201cA prank.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have to be a good one,\u201d she said. She meant: the people who hate you are not usually this clever.\n\nI went home walking on the spine of the night as if I were afraid of the edges. The alley was clean only because I had cleaned it. I set my bins inside my door like I was the kind of person who feeds a raccoon out of fear. In my mirror a girl with my hair looked out with eyes I didn\u2019t recognize and then she blinked and was me again. I threw a bottle at the trash can and missed. It rolled under the table and came to rest against a little nest of dust I had not decided if I loved or not. Sometimes human detritus is the only proof of animals.\n\nThere are so many stories about witches and their mirrors. How we fear them. How we live in them. How a mirror is just a river made obedient. I went to the river at midnight and held my breath until the stars looked like holes poked in black paper. A voice said, I won\u2019t recycle, and it was my voice, but I didn\u2019t say it. I said back, that\u2019s not what we do. The river said, do you know what you do? I have always admired water\u2019s rudeness.\n\nThe next morning the bins on Oneida were righted and resigned. The city had not yet noticed the scare. There were new marks on the brick by my door. The triangle, yes. And a phrase that made the edges of my vision pixellate just a little. we are the same\u2014 Someone had stopped before the last word, or maybe they had decided to let the wall keep it. The chalk was the same chalk I use to mark hems. The handwriting was mine, and it had been done either while I was asleep or while I had been someone else. There was a piece of black plastic tucked into my mailbox like a love letter, curled to a stiffness that made me think of bones. I took it inside and put it on the counter and just looked at it for a while until the looking became a ritual and that made it safer.\n\nI asked the river a question that afternoon with a net of copper wire and three dead batteries. The question was: what part of me is eating the rest? The river answered with a fish that had been born wrong, all eyes and no depth. It thrashed in my hands and I said sorry and I said it too late because that is how sorry works, and I let it go back to a thing that has no opinion about me.\n\nA day later, a woman with a late sunburn came into Stitch & Solder with an electric kettle and a look that said she had been up all night considering moral math. \u201cIt\u2019s broken,\u201d she told me, and then, compulsive, the confession: \u201cI burned my plastic bin. It was full and I was tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to fix your kettle or your certainty,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThey say there\u2019s a witch,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say she doesn\u2019t recycle. That must seem small to you, what with all the other things. But I feel it. The wrongness.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall things make systems. Systems make worlds,\u201d I said. I opened the kettle. A triangle had been scratched inside, amateur, angry. The kettle\u2019s heating element was clogged with a melt that must have screamed when it died. \u201cDid you do this?\u201d\n\nShe blushed, then hardened. \u201cHe said it would make it faster. He said we were just sending it somewhere else anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy boyfriend,\u201d she said, and the past tense gathered at the edges like a storm hoping to become history. \u201cHe said he knew a witch who was fixing the city. He said people like me\u2014well. You know what people tend to say about people like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on and finish,\u201d I said gently.\n\n\u201cPoor. Busy. Stupid. He said she made fire that ate things we can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nI set the kettle down. The river was in my ears, a low insistence. \u201cDo you know her name?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. They just called her\u2014\u201d She squinted in the direction of memory. \u201cCrackle.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve had many names. June, mostly, said by people who want me to stay. Bug, by Aunt Sable when she thinks she\u2019s my mother. Witch, by people who think they\u2019re hurting me when they\u2019re not. A girl once called me Stitch, soft. No one has ever called me Crackle. The name sat weird in my mouth, on my tongue like a seed I didn\u2019t want but swallowed anyway.\n\nI took the kettle into my lap and did the mending with my best needle. When I was done, I kept the triangle for myself. It fit over my mark with a symmetry I didn\u2019t want.\n\nThat night I waited for the other me like a date. I set the bins out with their lids latched like only a person who has had a raccoon in her flour knows how to latch. I brewed tea and I salted the doorway and I put the mirror under the bed upside down and I left my shoes pointed toward the river and I wore a hat. I don\u2019t know why I wore a hat. I paced. Around two or three\u2014same time, same slide\u2014the smell came. Sweet and wrong. The window carry of the alley\u2019s whispers. I stood in the doorway and I saw her.\n\nShe was my height. She was my hair but wrong by a degree, like a song played at a slightly different speed. She wore a coat I used to own, the green one with a patch on the elbow that looks like a leaf, and she had my shoulders like a promise. She tipped my bin and made a sigh like relief. She held the cigarette like a protest and then she thought better of it and put it out on the rim. She drew the triangle with the butt. It smeared. I stepped out, silent as a cat that hasn\u2019t decided if it loves you. She turned her head. I saw my face and didn\u2019t. The angle was different. The eyes\u2014no. They were mine. She knew my fear well enough to cross the street in front of it.\n\n\u201cWho are you saving,\u201d she said, my voice and not my voice, without the question mark, and then she ran. Or I ran. Or we both did in opposite directions, which maybe was the same direction.\n\nI chased. Of course I chased. I am not the kind of woman who watches her own back and does not try to tap it. Down Oneida, over the rumor of black ice, through a lot behind a bar with a sign in the window that said, quietly, be kind. Past the library that holds all our ghosts in a neat grid. Into the mill\u2019s shadow. Into the river\u2019s mouth. I lost her at the place where the Nestl\u00e9 stack throws a line across the ground even at night you can be burned by old light. She vanished like she knew how. And then I felt it\u2014the tug on the thread I had woven into myself when I touched that grease at the transfer station. It pulled and I pulled back and for a second I felt my own hand in mine and it scared me so much I let go.\n\nWhen I went back to my alley, the bins were not my bins. They were black bags. They were broken lids. They were the shape of a story I was still writing and couldn\u2019t yet read. I drew a circle on my kitchen table with salt and put my palms flat and said the names of the people I love. Aunt Sable in her swamp of a porch. Eloise in her iron spectrum. Etta with her tomatoes and her uncompromising butter. Gideon in his boat. The baby who looked at me in her stroller. The gull, even the gull. And I said my own name and watched it flicker as if it were a candle I had set too near a vent.\n\n\u201cJune-bug?\u201d Aunt Sable said when I called her at a time that would have been rude if she were not a woman who sits up and argues with the moon. \u201cSweet. Tell me it. The thing you can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d I said, and in the space after think all the possible lonelies gathered and held their breath, \u201cI think I am the witch who doesn\u2019t recycle.\u201d\n\nHer silence was a floor I lay down on. Then: \u201cYou don\u2019t do that, child. That\u2019s not your make.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what I do,\u201d I whispered, the kind of whisper that probably woke the next apartment. \u201cI put it in the right bins. I rinse. I sort. I banned plastic bags from my shop. I can\u2019t stand the sound a bottle makes when it breaks wrong. But there are nights, Auntie. There are nights when the burn\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know about the burn,\u201d she said softly, like a confession she had been waiting to say. \u201cYour mother\u2014well. And me. Me too.\u201d There was the sound of birds outside her window. Birds that eat time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to put things back,\u201d I said. \u201cNot to throw away the recyclable parts of ourselves. Not to light them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always loved a rule,\u201d she said. \u201cBut humans make rules because we don\u2019t trust the river not to do what it will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have my mark next to her mark,\u201d I told her. \u201cIn a place. In places. People are saying Crackle and I think that\u2019s mine, too. How can that be mine?\u201d\n\nSable made a sound like she was taking a pin out of her mouth. \u201cJune, every witch is two. Some are three. Some are a village. We are creatures of cycles and also of chasms. Maybe you made something to hold your scorch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d I said, bleak as iced-over mud.\n\nShe sighed, a heartbreak. \u201cThat is not the same as not having it.\u201d\n\nWhen I set the phone down, the salt circle had melted into a map of my kitchen I did not recognize. Outside, the bins waited for morning. The river turned over in its sleep. I stood in my doorway and listened to the city be everything it is: small and mean, kind and indelible, damp. I turned out my light and slept in my coat because I did not want to be caught naked by my other self when she came to do what I do not want to do and yet I will do if I can\u2019t bear not to.\n\nIn the dream the gull spoke in a voice that could have been the radio lady\u2019s or Gideon\u2019s or Aunt Sable\u2019s if you\u2019ve swallowed grief long enough. It said: recycle, recycle, the word became meaningless as all useful words do when they are said without an object to love. The gull opened its beak and out fell a river bead, blue and cold. I picked it up and knew it. I had put it in a jar months ago because it was pretty and forgot it. In the dream and then in my waking hand, it was the same marble that held the weather. The marble swirled. Rain, then lightning. A circle closing. A line breaking. I dropped it and it didn\u2019t roll far\u2014it found the seam in the floorboards where things vanish and go to be a secret.\n\nI do not have an answer, not at the close of this, not with the bins waiting, not with the city\u2019s vote delayed, not with Eloise\u2019s eyes asking what kind of ally I am if I am the problem, not with Etta\u2019s hands red from washing more cups than any person should wash, not with Gideon\u2019s boat, patient. I have a set of skills. I can find things that want to be found. I can bind. I can stitch the shape of a person back to the shape they think they are. I can solder cheap circuit boards until they confess their longing to be music. I cannot yet keep the other me from striking a match and smiling at the way it sounds. I can\u2019t say she is not me. I can say this: if I find her, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m going to save her or stop her or both. It will involve a mirror. It will involve the river. It will involve winter and glass and the smell of sugar singing wrong.\n\nFor now I rinse the jar. I sort the lids. I take the chalk from the wall and rub the words until they are dust in my palm. I do not blow the dust away. I put it in a bottle. I label it. I write: evidence of a choice you have not yet made. I put it on the shelf next to the marble that holds a storm. I sleep with the sound of bags as they whisper to each other in the night. I put my shoes by the door as if that is something like a spell. I wait. I wait like the river waits. I guess that is the only spell any of us ever learned that works.The day after I admitted to my aunt what my mouth had been refusing, the light came up thin and metallic, like water that has been through too many pipes before it gets to your tap. I pushed my bins back out because I refuse to be the kind of person who lets fear make her trash king. The lids clicked in that way that satisfies a part of the brain that believes it can keep everything from spilling if it puts enough force on plastic. The street was salt-scabbed. Tires made that noise of surrender that tires make when they finally find grit. I watched a man in a neon vest try and fail to fold a tarp over a stack of newspaper from last month, and I thought about time: how it stacks, how we try to keep it dry, how it always manages to pucker and spot.\n\nThe boy from Thirteenth shuffled past with his backpack ballooning with impossible angles. He has the kind of walk you learn when nothing you own wants to fit where it should. I keep his name in my mouth and never say it because he doesn\u2019t offer it and I\u2019m old-fashioned that way. He accepted the bag of caps I\u2019d been saving like the day had been waiting for him to arrive and rescue it. He put his hand in and sifted around until the clack changed into a note with tone. \u201cThey\u2019re making harder plastic now,\u201d he said, like a meteorologist who has stopped being surprised by storms. \u201cIt warps nastier. It goes all ugly.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of it was born ugly,\u201d I said, unable to help it. \u201cSome of it was born useful, then forgot.\u201d\n\nHe pulled out a fused sheet of blue, green, and bone-white, bubbled like the bottom of a cheap casserole dish that saw the broil setting one time and never forgave you. A triangle traced itself across the warps, uninvited and too clear. He turned it in his hands and squinted. \u201cHe said it was art,\u201d the boy said, meaning someone who isn\u2019t good enough to be a teacher and isn\u2019t brave enough to be an artist. \u201cHe gave it to me because it burned wrong. I tried to sand it, but it keeps the mark.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep it anyway,\u201d I said, even though my stomach wanted me to ask him to put it in my hands so I could do the stupid brave thing where you take a live wire because you respect it. \u201cYou\u2019ll know where it is if you need to break it.\u201d\n\nHe smiled sideways and tucked it into the backpack\u2019s mouth. \u201cPeople keep wanting me to make dolphins,\u201d he said, and rolled his eyes like he had just been asked to peel an orange with a backhoe. \u201cI\u2019m making a fox. It has ten tails.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I said. \u201cLet it have as many tails as it needs to chase itself and not get tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt runs on fire,\u201d he said with the satisfaction of someone who has named the fuel and isn't ashamed. He adjusted the straps and kept walking. When his back got small, the wind picked up, and a flurry of grocery bags did that thing where they pretend to be birds and then remember they have no bones.\n\nPastor Lennox showed up before I could decide whether to open or to hide. He came with a pamphlet that had not yet had the chance to be embarrassed by itself. He held it with the same fingers I\u2019ve seen on piano players. The pin in his tie was a cross the size of a thumbnail, which means you have to look, and that\u2019s the point. He looked at my sign, then at my hands, as if one of them was lying. \u201cMs. Weaver,\u201d he said in a voice that had put many babies to sleep and convinced many men they were forgiven. \u201cMay I take a moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d I don\u2019t do it because I\u2019m polite; I do it because if you are rude to a man like that, he will write you a starring role in a parable nobody wants to hear.\n\nHe came two steps inside and stopped like a dog that knows the edge of a rug and the edge of a territory are the same thing. He opened the pamphlet, honored its crease. There were photos of bins on fire, cropped tight so you couldn\u2019t see the hands. There were words like stewardship and words like danger, and there was a grainy capture that could have been anyone with my bones moving the world with their shoulders. \u201cWe want to help,\u201d he said, which documented a want, not a plan.\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d I asked, because my mouth has never been obedient when a word offers itself like a bridge and turns out to be a plank.\n\nHe nodded as if nodding was an argument that required no supporting text. \u201cRepentance is a form of sorting,\u201d he said, as though he was giving me a bag with compartments. \u201cYou take what you\u2019ve done and you put it where it belongs.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you sort your recycling, Pastor?\u201d The question came out too sharp, and I wished for a second I could bend it.\n\nHis mouth tightened in the way of people who know the answer will be used as a story no matter what it is. \u201cMy wife does,\u201d he said finally, and then, quickly, like a boy trying to make you understand why he is the way he is, \u201cI help when I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that kind of help,\u201d I said, and I smiled like a person with a hammer smiles at a screw. \u201cI\u2019m working on the burning. It\u2019s not a sermon, it\u2019s a thing with elements. It might require a controlled setting. It will require patience no one has.\u201d\n\nHe looked relieved in a way that made me sad for both of us. He set the pamphlet down as if it might explode under the wrong pressure. \u201cWe have a basement,\u201d he said. \u201cIn case you ever need one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a river,\u201d I said, and he nodded, like a man who knows when he has been bested by myth.\n\nAfter he left I locked the door not because I was afraid of him but because the room had changed shape and needed to be reminded of me. I took the mirror from under the bed and put it face-up on the table, the way you set a plate for someone you hope is in a mood to eat what you\u2019re serving. I fetched the jars with their labels my mother taught me to write like penance. Basil. Parsley. Rust. Rain. I took the blue marble out and put it in a teacup because some things need a witness and some things need a cradle. I chalked my mark small in one corner and the triangle small in the other, then I drew a line between them that my hand wanted to be straight and my heart wanted to be crooked. Then I threaded a needle with hair and linen and a wire you cannot buy; you gather it from the hum refrigerators make when they think no one listens.\n\nWhen I called for her, I didn\u2019t say her name because people who know better told me not to. I said mine twice and then once more under my breath, which is how you take honesty and make it a dare. For a full minute the only movement was the slow storm inside the marble, rolling itself like dough. The mirror showed me myself until it didn\u2019t. My face softened into a text you had to squint to read, then sharpened into a person who had my mouth but wore it like a borrowed thing.\n\n\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d do this,\u201d she said, and the mirror did a trick with depth that made me want to be sick on my own floor. Her coat\u2014it was that green so specifically mine it put a heat under my tongue\u2014was buttoned with impatience. She didn\u2019t touch the glass because she didn\u2019t need to. We both know how not to smudge if the thing that would get smudged is you.\n\n\u201cI keep a shop,\u201d I said, because sometimes the only way to begin is with a sentence you know is true. \u201cI keep a system. I keep my knees warm in winter. I keep the bins where the truck can get to them. Why do you keep lighting what I keep?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause keeping isn\u2019t saving,\u201d she answered, and where I have comfort she has clarity, and that\u2019s unfair, but the body never promised to divvy up the traits justly. \u201cBecause your keeping is a purse with a hole. You patch other people\u2019s fabric with gold and blood, and then you come home with fingers that itch and your jaw tight as a trap, and you put everything of yours in the neatest boxes and none of it gets smaller. You ask the river to carry it and she\u2019s tired, June. So I vault.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making fire from restlessness,\u201d I said, because we have both had the kind of lover you can\u2019t take to meet your friends. \u201cYou\u2019re burning the wrong thing to heat a room you don\u2019t even go into.\u201d\n\nShe tilted her head in that way I\u2019ve seen in reflective windows when you think you\u2019ve caught yourself and you haven\u2019t. \u201cYou want a kiln,\u201d she said, like a midwife naming a baby you didn\u2019t think you could have. \u201cYou want to build one, and you want to feed it on purpose. Don\u2019t lie to me. You like the truth too much to avoid the violent parts of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want a boundary,\u201d I said through my teeth. \u201cI want a burn that isn\u2019t a tantrum. I want to teach the heat to sing in key.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am your fire,\u201d she said mildly, like she was telling me what size shoes I wear. \u201cI am the part of you that doesn\u2019t sort, because sorting is a way to pretend that an ending can be domesticated. You called me when you looked at the bins and felt your own smallness like a bruise you keep pressing. You asked for a quick way. Quick ways are me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not ask for a gull full of toys,\u201d I said, and the mirror went mean around the edges, which is what happens when you say something the world takes personally. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for a boy with burned plastic in his bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou asked for relief,\u201d she said, not unkind now, which made me hate her a degree less and myself another degree extra. \u201cYou outsourced the heat. If you want it back, build me a mouth. If you want me gone, drown me. But you don\u2019t get to pretend I\u2019m not you. You don\u2019t get to call me she and leave yourself clean.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked, because I am so tired of metaphor even as I lace it into everything. \u201cHow do I build your mouth and not become a thing everyone will be sorry they tried to love?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already know,\u201d she said, looking down, and I followed her eyes because they are mine. The marble spun lightning. The storm pressed its face to the glass. The river had an opinion. \u201cRepeat your work, but hotter. Stitch, but with flame. Solder, but with stricter mercy. Capture the breath. Trap the poison in a tile and make the babies walk on it without it walking into them. You want to save. Save by transformation. Save by admitting you like to change things. Stop lying that mending is gentle.\u201d She smiled, and if you have never seen your own mouth smile at you when you do not want it to, I both recommend and do not recommend it. \u201cThree days,\u201d she said, conversational as weather. \u201cOn the fourth the wind will reverse. On the fourth I will do it without you.\u201d\n\nThe mirror went back to being a river that had learned obedience reluctantly. My face returned. My hair looked like the aftermath of a summer thunderstorm. The marble settled into rain and stayed, as if it had been convinced by argument or lulled by exhaustion. I sat and fed myself the heel of yesterday\u2019s bread with the care you give wild animals and thought about words like kiln and mouth and mouth that eats fire and spits glass. A plan is a spell with drawings; I made drawings with a pencil that had been used for meat and taxes and love notes and was therefore luckier than most.\n\nThe first person I told was Nate, because if anyone in this town knows how to look at a mountain that used to be a hill and decide where to put ropes, it\u2019s the man who will climb it because he\u2019s got to get the bottles out before they shift. He stood at the edge of the glass drop and chewed gum like it was the world\u2019s fingers, then nodded in the slow rhythm of someone calculating weight. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the old pizza oven Conklin tossed when the new one came with a touchscreen and a personality,\u201d he said, eyes half-closed because the picture he was looking at wasn\u2019t in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s ugly stainless, but it gets hot and holds it. We got ductwork nobody cries over if it smells like old pepperoni for the rest of its life. We\u2019ll need scrap iron, and we\u2019ll need to keep the witches who only read articles from showing up with signs. You promising me no plume?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m promising you capture,\u201d I said, not because I like to promise but because some men, and some ovens, only agree to show up if you use the right verb. \u201cI can net the breath. We\u2019ll bind it to ceramic. It won\u2019t like it, but it will hold.\u201d I didn\u2019t say tiles because tiles are for bathrooms and I was thinking about roads, about replacing asphalt with shame that held, about giving children hopscotch that keeps their lungs clear.\n\nWe welded. Welding is a kind of marriage if you\u2019re not careful how you talk about it. Sparks made confetti and we pretended it was a holiday. We hauled the carcass of the oven under the lean-to and bolted it to a floor that has held up more weight than any of us will ever give it credit for. I climbed inside with a brush and a mouth full of prayer and painted the interior with a slurry I made from Etta\u2019s ash, river mud, and the scraped grief off the bottom of Gideon\u2019s boat. The slurry dried to a dull grey like we had invented a new species of rock that remembered hands. Nate looked like he wanted to call someone to come make us stop, and then he remembered there wasn\u2019t anyone we trusted with that job. \u201cYou got a name?\u201d he asked, as if the right name would make the dial willing to go to ten without blowing past.\n\n\u201cRetort,\u201d I said, because Aunt Sable taught me that words are leashes and you choose the soft ones if you want something to follow you without bloodying your palms.\n\nEloise came with her clipboard and her hair pulled back so hard it changed her posture. She walked around the apparatus, tapping the metal with the butt of her pen because you don\u2019t get to chair a meeting in this town if you don\u2019t love the sound a machine makes when it pretends to be immune to your judgment. \u201cIf this fails,\u201d she said, and left the sentence there, gesturing at a future full of meetings none of us wanted to sit through because every chair in City Hall is haunted by one resigned woman and one stubborn man.\n\n\u201cIf this fails, I will move,\u201d I said, blunt, because sometimes you need to give a friend a picture of the cliff you\u2019re willing to walk over. \u201cIf it works, you will find a way to pay for the duct tape that doesn\u2019t look like duct tape.\u201d\n\nShe grunted, which I have decided is her way of agreeing when her hair is too tight to allow yes. \u201cYou\u2019ll need permits,\u201d she said, and then she signed the bottom of a paper and made the permits appear by reminding the universe who she is.\n\nGideon arrived last with a bucket of river stones the color of history. He ran his hands over the ducting like he was testing a horse, and the oven did not buck him because the oven is smart enough to know loyalty when it sees it. \u201cYou need ballast,\u201d he said, handing me the chain he took off a retired anchor. \u201cYou need to tie it to something people already agree not to move.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t want to stay?\u201d I asked quietly, thinking of other things I had strung with intention only to find they preferred the edge.\n\n\u201cThen you tell it a story about what happens when the river runs backward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll listen.\u201d\n\nWe fired the Retort with nothing in its mouth first, because even a hungry creature deserves a dry run. The oven glowed like a blush. Heat licked the ducts and went where it was supposed to go because Nate had promised to wring its neck if it tried any tricks. The capture jars\u2014old demijohns I\u2019d lined with the same slurry and wrapped in copper like fancy bottles who had married money\u2014fogged and then cleared and then stayed clear, as if we had put a net over a song and learned to hum in harmony. Etta came in with a tray of scones that tasted like penance and triumph and stood with her fists on her hips like a saint who had criticized God and found Him open to notes. \u201cWhen do you feed it?\u201d she said, as one does when one has watched someone perfect their oven and is ready to put in bread.\n\n\u201cAt night,\u201d I said. \u201cNot because it\u2019s skulking. Because I want it to learn what darkness is for.\u201d\n\nWe made a coat. I cut fire blankets into panels and stitched them with dull gold and thread I pulled from a rope, the kind of rope men have made and unmade their futures on. I lined it with foil that had once wrapped chocolates in a factory that wanted to pretend it was a cathedral, and I wrote sigils on the hems that said things like stay and things like consent. I tucked iron filings into the collar. I sewed my mark into the left wrist and left the right bare, because there should be a place for her to get out if she needs to remind me we make mistakes when we make prisons. This is the part no one sees when they come in for a button and a blessing and leave feeling lighter; the part where my teeth ache and my eyes go spiritless from looking at cloth until it becomes air. I bled on the sleeve and let it dry instead of washing it out like a good tailor. I want the garment to know whose blood makes its candor possible.\n\nOn the third day, the wind said the thing the mirror had promised. It changed direction without asking permission and brought with it a low note that made every bottle on the shelf in the back of my shop hum a sympathetic tune. The lake pressed its flat hand on the mouth of the river and said, go back. The river laughed the way a person laughs when you tell a joke that has sat too long in your pocket warming up on your leg: surprised and relieved in equal measure. Eloise texted me a weather map with an arrow and the word well. Gideon sent a picture of water shouldering itself up the wrong stair. Aunt Sable left a voicemail that was just a long exhale and then, at the end, \u201cDon\u2019t get in over your eyebrows, June-bug. Call me if you have to spit.\u201d\n\nI baited my trap like an honest liar. I filled a black bag with labels I had peeled and promises I had made and stuck all over my shirts like armor. I wrote on the outside in my neatest hand: Everything I am too tired to sort. I set it by the mouth of the Retort and left the door cracked like a lover. I unscrewed the bulb over the back door so the alley wouldn\u2019t look like a stage. I put on the fire coat and felt heavier and safer and too warm and not warm enough. I tucked the marble in my pocket because the storm wanted to watch. I waited with my palms on the edge of the oven like it was a table I trusted with family recipes.\n\nShe came without drama. She came like a woman who has been doing night work for years and knows doors by their creak and steps that don\u2019t rat out your presence. She put her hand on the bag and then on the oven and then she looked up like she had been hearing my voice for days and finally decided to stand where the sound was. I opened my mouth and told her the truth first, because I am superstitious about beginnings, because lies are mean if you let them start things. \u201cI want to keep you,\u201d I said. \u201cNot like a coin in a pocket. Like a language. Like a stove you ask to make soup and it doesn\u2019t catch the curtains. I want to give you a job you can live with.\u201d\n\nShe tilted her head, measuring me against herself, measuring the oven against her hand\u2019s memory of flame. \u201cWhat if your city loves me more for the spectacle?\u201d she asked, with a vanity I have earned and not enjoyed.\n\n\u201cThen I will ruin your spectacle with usefulness until even the men who love a problem for the way it makes their faces look cannot deny you improved their air,\u201d I said, and the coat made a tiny sound when I breathed that told me I was wearing a promise I might not yet have the credit for.\n\nThe wind shoved, and the river, stubborn as family, shoved back. The water at the quick-pour under the bridge tried to climb and then got tired and swallowed. The air tasted metallic; you never forget that taste when you have dragged a thunderstorm inside to meet your mother. She put her hands into the sleeves I held out and the coat took her like a story takes a listener who was ready all along. The iron filings murmured the names of tools. The foil whispered about candy. The gold thread sang low. She hissed when the hem touched her calves, not with pain, but with recognition.\n\n\u201cThree nights,\u201d she said again, but there was relief in it now, and a little threat, the way you tell a child it is bedtime even though the child put themselves to sleep on the floor an hour ago.\n\n\u201cWe have tonight,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd then the river will make its decision about direction. You said fourth; I\u2019m using the third.\u201d I opened the Retort\u2019s mouth and it breathed in a way that made the hairs on my neck consider retreating to another head. I put the bag in. I put my hand on her back like you would on the ribcage of a horse, and we sent it through together. The heat rose, but it didn\u2019t claw. The ducts stayed quiet, but not silent. The capture bottles fogged, cleared, held. The slurry smelled like old sugar and boundary. The triangle drawn on the oven door with grease smudged and slipped and then failed to hold shape. The coat brightened along the seams as if someone inside had remembered how to be seen without being caught.\n\nWe stood like that, two women leaning on a machine, any picture of a future that wants to get better needing too many hands to keep its shape. When the first tile fell from the mold, it made a sound like coins, like rain hard enough to wash even the stubborn corners. It was ugly in the way that newborn things are ugly before you bathe them and kiss them and teach them to do anything but eat. I pried it up with a flat iron and held it between fingers ready for blisters. It was a green the lake sometimes is when it has been arguing with the sun all afternoon. It held a triangle caught in a net of my mark, and for a second that might have been a year I thought about all the floors I could make.\n\nShe leaned her head on my shoulder and we were the same height because of course we are. She smelled like burnt sugar and riverside weeds and fear I\u2019ve almost learned to love. Outside, the river snapped and went the wrong way like a laugh that turns into a sob and then finds itself made of both. The streetlights shifted their reflections. The gulls panicked, then decided this too was a miracle they could shove their bodies around. Somewhere uptown, a man opened his door and told his dog this was weather and the dog believed him. Etta texted me a picture of a pot of chili because she cannot watch and not feed. Aunt Sable sent me a message with three words\u2014Do. Not. Blink.\u2014and it made me laugh, which was the same as crying, which was the same as deciding we could have one night of stranger tides and not be ruined.\n\nWe fed the Retort until the edges of my vision went soft and came back. We stacked the tiles like city planning. We watched the capture jars cloud and clear, cloud and clear, and every time the breath didn\u2019t escape my lungs unclenched a little more. We did not speak much because some work is communion and some is a kind of court. When the oven coughed, we let it. When the coat cooled, I did not take it off her because the night had decided to be the kind of night that will use you for kindling if you let your skin show. We stood and watched the river pretend to be a different river and I thought: I will take her to the council with the coat on and let them look. I will take a tile and set it on Eloise\u2019s desk and tell her to step on it. I will hand one to Pastor Lennox and tell him to put it in his basement and learn the names for the parts of his furnace. I will ask the boy on Thirteenth if he wants to build a fox that runs on a better fire.\n\nThe Retort sighed when we closed her mouth for the night and it sounded like a woman who, after a week of cleaning up other people\u2019s meals, has one put in front of her and decides to sit. The wind kept pushing. The river kept arguing. The street cats took cover in places they forgot to tell each other about. I turned to my other self and found that while I had been busy not blinking, she had taken half a step into me. It wasn\u2019t dramatic. It was an inch and a question. I didn\u2019t move away. The coat stitched light along her wrist where my mark lives, and I understood the only simple thing left to understand: the only way out of some habits is through. I think we slept standing up. I think the river carried us both in the same direction for once, even if it was the wrong one for a while. I think the gulls forgave us temporarily. I think tomorrow we will wake stiff and greedy for coffee and stubborn about hope. I think the tiles will cure overnight and my hands will remember the weight. I think I will show up to the meeting with ash under my nails and a new kind of evidence that wants to be touched and not just seen.\n\nWhen dawn found us, it had trouble deciding where to put itself. That kind of confusion makes accidents, but it also makes inventions. I opened my door and the night fell out in a lump and the morning scooped it back because mornings are good at pretending they anticipated everything. The air had that washed-out taste after a storm when everything looks newly painted and most of it is just old and wet. We took the coat off and it was like peeling a label from a jar that will never be as clean as you want it. She stood in her green, then she took the sleeve and laid it over my arm like a bandage and I let her. \u201cTwo more,\u201d she said, and I knew what the numbers meant. \u201cDon\u2019t humiliate me by making me useless. Nobody in this town deserves a saint.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never made one,\u201d I said, and we both tried not to smile like we shared the joke that my mother did not teach me and the river did. We went inside and I made tea that tasted faintly of the slurry because I hadn\u2019t washed the cup as well as a girl who lives alone is supposed to. We split a scone and it crumbled into a map that looked nothing like this town and everything like it. The Retort ticked as it cooled. The tiles clicked like teeth. The river ran backward again and then remembered itself and was forgiven. We cleaned our hands and the grey came off easy and not at all. I put the first tile in my bag and the second in my pocket and the third in the place where I keep my fear of being caught. I put on my boots and my patience and my plan. I called Gideon and he said, I\u2019ll be there if it floods in the room like it always does. I called Eloise and she said, don\u2019t give them anything they can call pretty without having to pay for it. I called Aunt Sable and she said, hush and listen, and in the hush I heard my mother say, that will do, June, and I didn\u2019t cry because I needed my eyes to see if the flames stayed where we told them to live.Eloise drove the meeting like she drives everything, with her shoulders and with a refusal to let her hair move unless it has been consulted. City Hall smells like old paper and a lemon cleaner that no longer believes in lemons. People came because they had decided the best way to spend a Thursday was to dress themselves in certainty and throw it at each other until something stuck. I walked in with the tiles wrapped in a towel that had been a shirt of my mother\u2019s when she thought she might be a woman who wore white. The weight in my bag was not enough to break a strap, but it was enough to change my gait from customer to witness.\n\nThe men who want the glass program gone had printed handouts with flames where glass bottles should be. Someone had photoshopped my sign into one of the images and made the needle in it a spear. Pastor Lennox sat in the back with his hands folded and his tie pin aimed like an argument. Etta commandeered a row with three women whose hands are always damp with dishwater and never tremble. Gideon stood by the window where he could see the river if it decided to come inside to listen. The boy from Thirteenth had found a corner to lean his fox against. It was unmistakable even unfinished: ten tails lifting like whispers, impossible and sure. The fox\u2019s face was cleverly built from a plastic bin lid cut into confidence.\n\nEloise tapped her pen, then tapped the wood with the gavel because the room needed to be reminded that wood has opinions. \u201cWe are not here to ask if witches exist,\u201d she said, and that was mercy and also a warning. \u201cWe are here to decide if we are going to pretend we can save money by throwing a kind of hope away.\u201d\n\nA man in a hat shaped like a decision raised his hand and didn\u2019t wait for permission. \u201cWe cain\u2019t have bins on fire,\u201d he announced in a voice like a won argument. \u201cIt looks bad. It is bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said, before anyone else could, because I am tired of letting the wrong people have the first true sentence. I walked to the front and the city clerk who hates women with bags pretended not to hate mine. I put a tile on the floor of the aisle. You could make a religion out of watching people decide whether or not they are willing to step on something when they do not know if it is a trap. I stepped first. It was cool with a warmth underneath, the way some people are in public. \u201cWe burned what would have been burned anyway,\u201d I said, and a wave of incorrect understanding went through the room and broke. \u201cNo,\u201d I amended, because I refuse to be adopted by their stories. \u201cWe burned what was going to be burned wrong, and we told it where to live afterward. Pick it up.\u201d\n\nPastor Lennox rose without being called like we were in a service after all and lifted the tile as if it might have a pulse. The green had cured overnight into something that held the light in its teeth. The triangle was caught, line broken over my mark and then bent into new angles that didn\u2019t remember being vicious. You could see the breath trapped in it if you knew breath has a shape when it is tired enough. He passed it to the man in the hat and the man did not want to hold it and he did anyway because people like him will never turn down an opportunity to prove they are not afraid of women\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d someone called, a woman with a baby in a carrier who was telling me she wanted to be told, not scared.\n\n\u201cHeat that would otherwise go wandering,\u201d I said. \u201cA little shame. Bits of conversations that were happening in alleys when we were asleep. There are chemicals too.\u201d I glanced at Eloise and she gave me the go-ahead to be more exact. \u201cWe captured volatiles from polyethylene and a tantrum, and we tied them to ceramic with a slurry of ash and river. We made the breath honest. We\u2019re measuring the capture with proper instruments borrowed from the college because I want numbers, not just poetry. Right now it\u2019s a pilot that works in my alley and uses regret as fuel. I want it to be a line item.\u201d\n\nA cheer began, then remembered itself and turned into clapping that belongs to meetings. The man in the hat frowned like he had been asked to parent a nephew. \u201cWhat happens when the witches move?\u201d he demanded, which was a nicer version of, what happens when June leaves or fails us.\n\n\u201cThen you will have to love it enough that it stays,\u201d I said, which is not how budgets work and also how they do. \u201cOr you will hire a woman who knows how to stitch and how to heat without terror.\u201d\n\nGideon raised a hand and the room let him interrupt because they have seen what he carries up the bank. \u201cI have two boats,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this program goes, I\u2019ll have three. I\u2019d rather have a kiln in a lean-to than another stretch of river tied to my stern.\u201d\n\nPastor Lennox surprised me by coming forward. He set the tile on the edge of Eloise\u2019s dais and then did something genuinely humble. He stepped on it. He put his weight down. He closed his eyes. When he opened them he said, \u201cIt sounds like nothing,\u201d and I saw how hard he worked to make everything sound like God. \u201cWe can put one in the church basement where the furnace coughs in winter. We have a fan that pulls air from the street. Let us catch something and prove it to the stubborn.\u201d\n\nEloise\u2019s face did the math of how many ways she was going to be scolded for whatever came out of her mouth. \u201cMotion to maintain glass and to fund a pilot capture for non-compliant combustion,\u201d she said briskly, and the room murmured because she knows how to make things sound like they\u2019ve already been passed. \u201cMotion to not let the word witch be the reason we cut something that works.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cMotion to requisition that ugly pizza oven from our storeroom that no one could bring themselves to throw away because we are emotionally attached to our leftovers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d said Etta, because she will marry Eloise to her job over and over until one of them is allowed to rest. A councilman whose wife does not let him leave the house with a plastic straw voted no so loudly his neck vein flexed. Two men abstained because they had never been taught that choosing is a form of spellcasting. The yeses were not loud. They were enough. It is a kind of love to be enough.\n\nAfter, a woman with a gull on her shirt came to me with her mouth set like a hospital. She had the sharp look of the newly bereft who have already forgiven you because it is easier to carry forgiveness than vengeance when you have to also carry groceries. \u201cI saw the pictures,\u201d she said, soft so the room would not decide to possess our conversation. \u201cI saw what they put in its gut. I want to put one of those in my kitchen.\u201d Her finger touched the tile and came away clean. \u201cI want to stand on something that used to be a problem and have it feel like floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring you one,\u201d I promised, because there are things you only promise to women like that, and you keep them because otherwise the tiles are just pretty. \u201cPut it by your door. You\u2019ll feel the air change.\u201d\n\nOutside, the wind was still doing the thing where it tries on hats and forgets where it left the one it needed. The boy from Thirteenth waited for me with his fox. Up close the creature was a joy and a warning. He had cut tails from milk jugs that had held a hundred kinds of sweetness and no one remembers them once they\u2019re empty. He had fused them to a backbone made from a ruined crate I recognized. In the center he had left a cavity the size of a beating. \u201cIt needs a heart,\u201d he said, as if that were a normal thing to say in public.\n\nI put my hand in my bag and my fingers knew which tile to find. It wasn\u2019t perfect. Nothing perfect belongs in a creature that plans to move. I gave it to him flat across both hands so he knew it was a gift that asked him to decide. He took it like a boy who has been hungry too long takes a bowl he intends to wash afterward. He fitted it into the fox. The tails lifted like a choir considering their entrance. He smiled\u2014not polite, not for me\u2014the kind you cannot teach and want to protect anyway.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone make you make dolphins,\u201d I said, and he laughed the way a kid laughs when you name a ghost he thought only he could see.\n\nBack in the shop, the tiles looked like a stack of decisions. The Retort\u2019s mouth, when I opened it, sighed me into the afternoon. We brought the capture jars to the college and made a professor cry by admitting magic and measurement have always been married and we\u2019re just finally throwing them a dinner with witnesses. Nate came by with bolts and his grin and said he\u2019d scrounge us a proper hood from a restaurant that had died quietly in August. He winked and left a bag of washers that a person far from here might call charms. People brought offerings: a length of copper pipe that had outlived three kitchens, a stack of bricks with names scratched in, a ceramic rooster whose owner claimed it woke up and crowed the morning she decided to leave her husband and therefore might give us one good loud warning when we needed it.\n\n\u201cNight Two,\u201d she said at dusk without bothering the mirror, without making the hair on the back of my neck try to run. She stood in the doorway like a memory I\u2019d been expecting and didn\u2019t dread because I had given her a job. The coat waited on the hook with the patience of a garment that knows it has become a tool and a myth. When I helped her into it we didn\u2019t look at each other\u2019s eyes. The skin there is honest to a fault.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do when we were small?\u201d I asked as we fed the bag we had collected at the transfer station into the Retort in two careful pieces, because sometimes the ritual is in not pretending you can swallow whole. \u201cWhat did you burn for me that I could not stand to see disappear the slow way?\u201d\n\nHer mouth twitched. It wasn\u2019t a smile; it was a muscle remembering practice. \u201cThe notes we wrote to boys before we learned how to want without apology,\u201d she said first, and it made me weirdly fond of us. \u201cThe white gloves your mother insisted you wear to Aunt Sable\u2019s church the three times she felt a failure for not giving you pews and thought she could mend it with lace. The photographs of the car. The final letter from your father\u2019s one good week. The wrappers from the candy we ate on a dock the day we watched a boat go where it was not tied to go.\u201d She slid a look at me because we both remember the scraping panic that comes when water refuses to play by the rules you admire. \u201cI burned our shame when it got heavy. I burned our boredom because it was louder than prayer.\u201d\n\nI felt the coat lift at the shoulder like a breath. We watched the jars milk and then clear, and the calm that came into the room was not quiet. It was something like competence, which is rarer than peace and twice as holy. \u201cYou set the trash can behind the first apartment on fire,\u201d I said after a while, the words coming out on a leash I had never tried to put on them before.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said, not proud and not sorry. \u201cYou were fourteen, and your mother had started sleeping on the couch because the bed had become a continent where each of you tried and failed not to colonize each other. You wanted everything fast. I obliged. Aunt Sable came with a bucket and a warning and a glamour to keep Mrs. Calabrese from stepping out onto her stoop and starting a decade\u2019s worth of trouble with her mouth. She told me to get out of your legs unless I planned to teach you how to run. I left and I waited. You named me when you couldn\u2019t sleep for the first time and syllabled the sound a bag makes when a match loves it. I like my name. Don\u2019t take it if you don\u2019t mean to wear it.\u201d\n\nThe tile from that burn came out mean and beautiful. It had a vein of red in it like a vein in a wrist, and it embarrassed me to want it. I cooled it on the table that has held every mistake I\u2019ve ever managed to recover into usefulness. I put my palm on it and felt the hum. It was not dangerous. It would be if I put it under a pillow. We stack our hums in foolish places.\n\nThe man the sunburned woman had called \u201che\u201d tried to set the Retort on fire on Night Two because of course he did. Show any town a solution and it will cough up a person with a hobby of breaking tools. He came with a can of accelerant and a mask he bought because a forum told him masks make men impervious to consequence. He sloshed inexpertly and lit expertly and the flames did what flames know. They licked for edges. The coat hummed and pulled the heat into itself and laid it gently down like a child who has thrown up in the back seat and is ashamed. Gideon, who knows how to be in three places at once when water is involved, arrived with the smaller boat\u2019s pump rigged to a barrel and turned the arc into a line that convinced the fire it owed us something. The Retort\u2019s mouth yawned and took what it was offered. The capture jars clouded in outrage. The tiles stacked their usual steady clatter. The man ran because his mask told him the story of vanishing. Nate chased him halfway to the old tannery before remembering he\u2019s built for lifting and swearing, not sprinting in the dark.\n\nAfter we cleaned the scorch marks that the Retort had the decency to keep on its own skin, I sat on the floor with my back to the oven and my knees up. Fear is not a spell; it is a door you have to unlatch with hands that shake. \u201cYou built me a mouth,\u201d she said, and that was a kind of apology and also a covenant. \u201cI won\u2019t keep going to alleys where I am uninvited. I like being asked. It reminds me I was a choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay,\u201d I said, to practice for strangers. \u201cWork. Do not confuse hunger with need.\u201d We say this to babies because we are trying to raise ourselves.\n\nOn the morning of the third day the river pretended to be tired of tricks. It looked like any river again to anybody who has never had to stand on a bank and persuade it by name. Aunt Sable arrived without warning in a sweater the color of a bruise that is almost better. Her mouth looked like it had been set in the night and would not unscrew for anybody but me. She kissed my eyebrows and my cheekbones and the top of my head, which is what she does when she is counting what I have left. \u201cYou look thinner in the ways that matter,\u201d she said, then put her hands on the Retort and hissed a little through her teeth like a smith greeting a friend. \u201cShe likes you. You feeding her regular? You letting her rest?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I have my pride and because it was true. \u201cHe came with a can last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoney,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes in a circle that took in every bad idea a man has had within a hundred-mile radius, \u201cthey always do. You cannot fix making without breaking and you cannot make breaking honorable. You can only make it expensive.\u201d\n\nWe took a tile to Pastor Lennox and I let him put it by the vent in the basement. He looked at me like a man looks at a woman right before he asks a question he knows is going to be a foolish one unless she decides to treat it kindly. \u201cDo you pray when you work?\u201d he ventured, trailing the P like he might need to apologize for it.\n\n\u201cI count,\u201d I said, because that is the thing closest to true. \u201cStitches. Bolts. Breaths. I say names. I say yes. It does something to my mouth that prayer probably does to yours.\u201d I left him with the tile and his basement smelling faintly of sugar that burned for a good reason.\n\nEloise met me on the steps with a paper bag and an expression like she had just kissed a victory and it had bitten her. \u201cDo not let them make you a symbol,\u201d she said, thrusting the bag into my hands without ceremony. \u201cYou cannot be eaten for breakfast and expected to come back for dinner.\u201d I opened the bag and found six permits and a pair of gloves that fit and an orange I had not admitted to needing until it was in my palm.\n\n\u201cNight Three,\u201d my other self said at dusk, flipping the coat off the hook with only the flourish I would have allowed myself if I were alone. We had two bags, because I had spent the afternoon at the transfer station pulling triangles like thorns from the edges of lids and telling promising shapes they were not invitations. The Retort took them the way a grandmother takes a plate from a girl who has learned how to feed her: not surprised, still grateful. The jars did their cloud-clear, which had become a metronome for a kind of music I did not want to dance to and could not stop hearing. Outside, the wind from the lake went sulky and tried to slip around the edges of buildings without being noticed. Heat has its rites, and so does cold.\n\nWe did not talk much. When the tiles came, the third night\u2019s were different. They were veined with something that looked like writing. The marks were not mine. They were not the triangle\u2019s. They were little rumors of letters that I will convince you one day are a script spoken by rivers when they are trying to teach steel to think. I stacked them carefully and then took one to the river, because I am not an idiot about payment. I set it on the bank and the water lapped it like a name. I let the river keep it. The tile slid under with a contentment I have never been able to give anything other than tea.\n\nAt the mirror after, I called her and she came and she looked like me without anything to do. It is not a flattering expression. \u201cIf we put you into a tile,\u201d I said, hating myself for the thought even as I loved myself for being willing to have it, \u201cwould you stay where I put you until I asked again?\u201d\n\nShe smiled, small and not for show. \u201cIf you trap me, you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life carrying me around looking for a way to teach me without starving me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather wear the coat and learn to eat like a person. That is your vanity talking when it asks for artifact. Keep a piece of me in a pocket if it helps you sleep. Let the rest stay in the part of your mouth that makes yes. Don\u2019t put me behind glass.\u201d\n\nWe did not leave each other that night because there are nights when leaving is silly theater and there are nights when leaving is necessary. We slept in shifts, stretched in the coat, with the Retort ticking like a polite animal. At dawn I carried tiles around town like a green Mary handing out a sacrament nobody has agreed on yet. I put one in the co-op by the compost bins. I put one under the counter at Conklin\u2019s where the new oven huffs like a dog with a grudge. I left one for the woman with the gull shirt and she sent me a photograph of the square by her door with the caption, it looks like a lake, and a second message that made my lungs widen: it feels like opening my window.\n\nThe boy from Thirteenth came in without knocking because I had told him to stop knocking. He held the fox. He had given it eyes made from the bottoms of bottles I had seen on my own sill last spring. He had put the tile-heart in and sealed it with copper wire braided into nerve. \u201cIt runs,\u201d he said, breathless the way boys pretend not to be, and he set it down and it did. It did not move in a way that makes science happy. It moved the way you feel a thing in your peripheral, and if you turn to look at it properly it firmly refuses to be caught doing anything that could get it in trouble. It made a sound like a kettle that knows better. He looked at me and tried to play bored and then couldn\u2019t. \u201cThey asked me for dolphins again,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes so big you could take a small boat into them.\n\n\u201cSay no,\u201d I said, and then, because that is not as easy as it comes out of my mouth, I reached under the counter and gave him a roll of wire and a pair of pliers that had belonged to my grandfather and are the closest thing I own to a blessing. \u201cWhen you have told them no enough times, make the thing that refuses to be a compromise. Then go to the river and ask it to mind your tails when you\u2019re asleep.\u201d\n\nHe hefted the pliers like a boy hefts a responsibility. \u201cYou want your tile back when I\u2019m done?\u201d he asked, manners winning out over art for a second.\n\n\u201cLet it run on,\u201d I said, and he grinned with his whole face and fled because boys know when to leave before you change your mind and give them rules they will enjoy breaking and also apologize for.\n\nThe man with the accelerant was arrested because he had posted footage of his own crimes with captions that suggested he thought arson is a form of commentary when it is only a form of cowardice. Eloise told me this in a message that did not enjoy delivering satisfaction. She added: strings were pulled. I wrote back: who holds the other end, and she sent me a photograph of a hand I know I will recognize if it ever passes me a bowl at a potluck. The city is small. There are not that many hands. You always know whose hands are doing the breaking.\n\nNight Three ended, but the heat did not go away. Heat never goes away. It moves its chair. It learns new names. It gets a job. I put the coat on the hook and the hook bent a fraction and then straightened as if it was willing to be stronger for us. She and I stood in the kitchen. We looked at the jars and the tiles and the list I had written without admitting I had written it\u2014places that need one, people who will use them, a corner in my own shop where the air goes stale. \u201cDo we braid?\u201d I asked, because sometimes you are brave enough to ask the question your aunt warned you lies under other questions like a river under a street.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, with a kindness that relieved and annoyed. \u201cYou are not done liking me separate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill we always clean up in the night?\u201d I pressed, thinking of women who age into the kind of tired that doesn\u2019t squeak anymore.\n\n\u201cIf we are lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we are not, we will tend fires we did not build for people who do not say that we did. Either way, we will get very good at sleeping on our feet.\u201d\n\nOn the morning the river remembered itself entirely and stopped playing the backward game, the council brought cameras. Eloise told them to aim at the tiles and at the duct and not at my face more than they needed to. Pastor Lennox quoted a verse about furnace and proof and did not make it about me, which I marked down as growth for both of us. Etta brought donuts iced the color of lake-glass and set them in a neat row that said: look how delicious sustainable can be. Gideon stood with one hand on the ducting as if the city were a boat that might untie itself and drift. The boy with the fox came because he likes to be where grown-ups pretend to know what to do next. Aunt Sable wore a dress with anchors and a smile like, if anybody calls this a miracle in my hearing I will make sure they are put to work.\n\nWe fired the Retort for demonstration, but I kept the burn small because the only thing better than spectacle is refusal. It glowed, but not spectacularly. It breathed, but not dramatically. The capture jars did their trick and then were just glass again, empty and suggestive. The tile we pulled was ordinary. I wanted them to see the fact that ordinary can be savior. Eloise spoke in that way she has that makes it sound like we are all in a choir and suddenly found our note. \u201cWe will pilot. We will measure. We will not cut glass,\u201d she said, leaning on the gavel hand the way she does when she thinks she might cry and would rather break the table.\n\nAfter, a girl who works in the library in the afternoons and reads tarot in her kitchen at night came to me with a book on kilns she had nicked out of the discard pile. It had been stamped withdrawn in the tidy grief of librarians. \u201cI thought you might like to keep it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were going to pulp it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate pulping,\u201d I said, turning the pages and feeling the comfort of diagrams that believe if you follow instructions you can hold fire without apology. \u201cThey always think it\u2019s mercy.\u201d\n\nThe wind laid down. The river curled around its own ankle and looked up, seductive again instead of churlish. I took a tile to the Nestl\u00e9 grounds and laid it at the foot of a wall that had held back sweetness for too long. I chalked a new sentence under the old chalk: we are the same only to the degree that we forgive the ways we aren\u2019t. I rubbed it with my sleeve and let the brick decide how much to keep. I went home and sorted. Clear to clear. Brown to brown. Green into green. Plastics into the bag I will not put to flame unless I am wearing the coat and the river has been told and the duct is happy. Metal, paper, cardboard cut down to rectangles that stack like a version of my hope. My hands still smelled like sugar that went hard and then learned to be useful. My breath fogged the glass enough to write on it with my finger. I wrote my name. I wrote hers. I wiped both off with the heel of my hand and watched the river through the smear and thought, I will build a floor out of our worst and then I will dance on it until the tired in this city learns to be proud.After the cameras, after the palms smudged with tile dust, after the carefully neutral interview in which I said words like pilot and community and not once said spell, the town exhaled the kind of breath people let go when they think they have gotten away with something good. It wasn\u2019t relief; relief has a softness the wind did not grant us. It was a recalibration. In my pocket the marble pressed at my hip in slow circles as if the weather inside it had been taught to dance a box step. I opened Stitch & Solder to the cautious bell of the afternoon and stood for a long moment with both hands on the counter, feeling the leftover heat in the wood, the extra heartbeat thin work gives it. If I had been a different kind of woman I would have written down the day on an index card and filed it under proof, to be pulled out later when doubt got clever. I have never managed to keep files outside my own ribs.\n\nThe first visitor after the spectacle smelled like lake wind trapped in a car. She had state in the cut of her jacket and DEC on a small enamel pin that had been chosen by someone who thought plants and letters shared a joke. She introduced herself as Delia Mott and didn\u2019t offer a hand. I can forgive that in winter and in women who are more used to touching water than skin.\n\n\u201cI saw the jars,\u201d she said. She had a face that had grown allergic to adjectives. \u201cI saw the test numbers the college sent over. I don\u2019t like your words for it, but I don\u2019t mind that you have them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like my words,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can have your own and we can point them at each other like flashlights and see if the same corners get lit.\u201d\n\nA corner of her mouth considered becoming a smile and thought better of it. She took out a small device that looked like the descendant of a compass and a toy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a bale fire,\u201d she said, in the tone of a woman warning a friend about a tendency with a name. \u201cNot because of the rumor kids. Because of physics and carelessness. The stacks at the station have been going up in the region. Once one takes, it burns like a book you thought wouldn\u2019t keep your attention. Hours. Sometimes days. Plastics throw tantrums when you gang them up and squeeze the air out, and when they go it\u2019s a dragon you don\u2019t get to befriend. You try to smother, it sulks and burns deeper. Water makes it mad. Foam drowns dollars and pride. If you\u2019re going to keep your mouth, you\u2019ll need to teach it to eat big.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a Retort,\u201d I said, refusing to apologize to her invisible colleagues for capitalization. \u201cI have ducting. I have a coat that can withstand more heat than I like admitting fits my shoulders. I have a city with too many hands and not enough patience. I have\u2014\u201d I didn\u2019t mean to say I have her, but the sentence tilted and there she was anyway, my other self shifting inside me in the way a cat shifts behind a curtain and you\u2019re aware of both the moving and the choice to let it remain unseen. I did not flinch. \u201c\u2014help.\u201d\n\nDelia looked at me the way the river looks at a new dock. \u201cYou\u2019ll have resistance,\u201d she said, a little tired now, like a woman who has had too many meetings about ash. \u201cYou\u2019ll have someone tell you that your jars are masquerade. You\u2019ll have a man say he knows what fire wants because he has a grill and an opinion. You\u2019ll have to decide whether your coat makes you a firefighter or a hazard. The forms aren\u2019t made for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never looked at a form and thought it was,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can hold a pen. I can wait. I can show up where the fire is doing its worst and turn its mouth toward work.\u201d\n\nShe tilted the device at my shelves and it clicked as if it had found a toy it would later complain about having to share. \u201cI hate that magic gets there before money,\u201d she said flat, and there was a kindness in it truer than any of the compliments I had been handed that morning like cheap mints. \u201cCall me when the bale goes.\u201d\n\nShe left me her card with a number written in pencil on the back, which is how serious women tell you where they will really be. When she left, the bell protested as if it didn\u2019t like being asked to chime twice so close together. I put the card on the mirror and the mirror considered it and then, with the polite vanity reflective surfaces possess, returned my face with two expressions: the one that believes in permits, and the one that burns them.\n\nWe had one full night with no crisis and I used it improperly. I should have slept. I made more of the coat instead. Not another whole; I am not so hubristic as to think I could duplicate the way the first one learned my breath. I made cuffs that I could hand to other people so they could steady a pipe without losing their skin. I stitched a cap for Nate, against his insistence that he has never been burned in his life. I lined the insides with my dull gold and my superstition. Aunt Sable sat at my table and pretended not to supervise while she picked parsley heads into a bowl and told me about the kind of forecasters who develop crushes on storms.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mother loved a ruin,\u201d she said suddenly, the parsley scent brighter for being recalled. \u201cIt made her feel braver. Don\u2019t repeat her bravest part. Pick another.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you have me pick?\u201d I asked, not irritated, exactly, but aware that I was a tendon away from it.\n\n\u201cPick staying,\u201d she said, as if she were asking me to pass the salt. \u201cPick boring. Pick the kind of magic that takes longer than anyone in a loud hat thinks they have.\u201d\n\nWe were almost done with the cuffs when Gideon knocked twice in a pattern he has agreed not to change on me. His hat was under his arm and his hair did that thing like it had argued with spray and lost. He looked older than yesterday and younger than last year, which meant something had been found and something had been spared. \u201cIt\u2019s started,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the bale yet. Not there. Out by the field behind the old tannery. Plastic and leaves, which is a combination invented by a person who has never asked a fire what it wants to eat. Somebody took a picture and somebody else took a match. I tamped it with shovels and a boy, but it\u2019s crawling under like a secret. It\u2019ll find a stump and then we\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d\n\nI put down the cuff and picked up the coat. I wanted to have a ritual. I wanted to kiss the doorway, murmur to the jars, touch my mother\u2019s scissors with the back of my hand. I didn\u2019t. I tied my boots. I put the marble in my pocket so that when I put my hand there later looking for courage I would find weather instead. Sable caught my sleeve with two fingers. \u201cYou do not go looking for the girl when you are tired,\u201d she said. \u201cYou let her come to you when you\u2019ve already lit the stove and set the table. She behaves better when she feels expected.\u201d\n\nThe night over the field was the color of the underside of a dog\u2019s ear. You want to call it brown and you\u2019re wrong; there\u2019s more to it than that. You could hear the fire before you saw it. Low. Insulted. The pile itself wasn\u2019t large\u2014two yard bags loosed and a drift of leaves up against the chainlink, bottles and a broken tote, bits of plastic lawn edger that wanted to pretend they were snakes. But someone had laced the bags with something that made the flames talk in a way I recognized. The triangle had been drawn on the side of a half barrel. It looked tired of itself.\n\nWe did not perform. Gideon didn\u2019t add water. He shouldered the pump anyway because that is his way of not admitting he knows when he isn\u2019t needed. I shrugged the coat on and felt the heat hesitate like a sentence in a mouth that has learned the word if. I opened the Retort in my mind because the lean-to was too far and the duct was asleep. I have stitched enough to know that sometimes the tool is what you have where you are. I cupped my hands and made the kind of mouth you teach to a child when you teach them how to blow out a candle without spitting wax everywhere. She took my elbows; we both breathed.\n\nIt is not beautiful work. The smell fought back, sweet and ugly. The plastic shrieked in whatever register shame hums in. My hands shook with the effort of telling heat who is older. The air bent and the cool underlayer slipped forward. I felt the coat take it and slow it and send it where the jars in my head had been set. It occurred to me that I was being watched and should straighten my back; I did not. I made my back round around the burn and let the night make its own judgments. Gideon stood where men stand when they have been instructed by women without noticing. He did not speak. He adjusted the pump\u2019s intake like a person adjusting a halo they didn\u2019t agree to.\n\nWhen it was done, when the pile had become the kind of ash that contains both apology and potential regret, I chalked a small circle over the triangle on the barrel and the chalk found purchase on the soot like chalk always does. I drew my stitch over it and the line broke the line and something in me eased. On the ground, embedded in the dregs of the bag, a piece of plastic had fused into a shape you could mistake for a fish if you wanted to. I did not want to. I put it in my pocket and the marble sulked because it does not like company it did not choose.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Gideon said, which meant: am I going to have to go to anyone\u2019s mother in the morning with my face arranged.\n\n\u201cNot kids,\u201d I said. \u201cBut not men either. Someone doing a ritual too careful for a teenage dare and too messy for a professional. Someone who read half a forum and none of a book. Someone who blew on a coal and liked the sound their own breath made.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if I had handed him a location. \u201cThe bales are stacked like graves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re dry under where the tarp doesn\u2019t reach. One spark. I told Nate to sit on them. He said he would. He won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe was right on both counts. The call came when the moon had been up long enough to make men ridiculous. I picked up the phone and I knew it before it spoke. The sound behind Nate\u2019s voice was the low hum of something that intends to be a roar. You can tell by the way it refuses to issue apologies on your timeline. \u201cIt\u2019s taken,\u201d he said, and his gum snapped once in the middle of the sentence like punctuation. \u201cMiddle of the stack, front left, next to the pallet with the bent nail. I got it isolated and I got cones and I got a kid with common sense standing in the road waving cars off. I don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn my way,\u201d I said, and put the coat on as if it were an argument I had been waiting my whole life to have. I did not put a hat on, because sometimes you have to let your scalp feel the weather or it will take its revenge in a less convenient circumstance. I texted Delia Mott and didn\u2019t wait for dots. I texted Eloise and didn\u2019t apologize. I told Aunt Sable to pretend I had not told her anything, and she hissed down the line with the tenderness of a kettle.\n\nWhen you see a bale fire for the first time you think very unkind thoughts about anyone who has ever used the word manageable in a meeting. They had put the stacks in neat rows as if neatness could teach vice lessons. The fire had found the seam in the front and it had chewed inward with the same patience I have for hems. The outward face looked ordinary\u2014flames flowered, smoke insisted\u2014and then the bale split and the belly of it glowed a terrible cherry, and I understood why you do not put your hands in the thing you have made, even if you love it. The air above it was a muscle flexed wrong. Nate stood with a hook and his cap and a face that said: I have been taller than most problems and this one has decided not to be impressed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t drown it,\u201d Delia said, coming up on my right with her device clipped to her jacket like a brooch that knows things. Her breath looked like mine in the cold. \u201cIf you drown it, it sulks and eats back. You have to give it a way out and stop the out from going into our air. It\u2019s an insult,\u201d she added, high enough for the fire to hear, \u201cthat it gets agreeable once it\u2019s been given a purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsults I can handle,\u201d I said, and then louder, because the blaze knew my voice and I was not going to pretend otherwise. \u201cYou liked the coat. You liked the mouth. You liked being aimed. Here is a feast. Do not disgrace yourself.\u201d\n\nWe made a maw out of ugly things. Nate had a roll-off bin at the back, half full of things that can handle heat and things that pretend they can until they forget themselves. We tipped it empty with a racket to wake the men on the other side of town who pretend to hate witches and secretly get bored when nothing is on fire. Delia rigged a fan from the back of her truck and said nothing about the law. I tugged ducting into place with Gideon anchoring chain to the corner of the bale and did not think about how much of my life is literally duct tape and faith. We made the Retort\u2019s mouth at a distance, a cousin, an improvisation I would have laughed at in another chapter. I turned the capture jars into an array and pretended they were pretty on purpose. The coat sang under my hands, which is not a thing I admit to often and may not admit to again.\n\nShe came without being called separately. There are nights when I go looking for her; there are nights when she goes where fire is because our agreement was never about ownership. She slipped into the coat like the coat had missed her. She held the seam at the back of the makeshift duct with one hand and put the other on the bale, not on the flame but on the place heat makes in the air. The triangle had been painted on the pallet and then bled up into the wood like a fever dreaming of symbols. She looked at me and I drew my stitch over it in the air, and if anyone ever tries to tell you that gesture means nothing, send them to my alley and I will teach their bones to feel otherwise.\n\nThe first pull was easy. Fire loves to be asked. The second was insulted; we had tricked it into working. It tried to throw its smoke into our lungs and found the coat between us. The jars fogged and only one failed, out of six, which felt like a sin I could ask to be allowed to make again. Nate put the cap on the failed one with a hand steady enough to clip a bishop. Delia\u2019s device chattered and heeded her; she adjusted the fan with two fingers and the air changed by a degree you would miss if your blood didn\u2019t know. Gideon rigged the boat pump into a push and created a draft the bale could not argue with. The fire went under. It went up. It went where we told it to go. It behaved like a thing that had been given a chore with consequences and praise attached.\n\nOn the third pull I saw the thing I didn\u2019t want to see and the town will never know it almost cost them me. In the heart of the bale, lodged like a penny under a tongue, there was a toy car melted into a melt. It wasn\u2019t anything; it was a dollar store red with racing decals. It had caught and fused and seemed to grieve itself. It had the same make as the car my father had driven. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s nothing. That\u2019s everything, when you are already hot and your memory keeps rolled photographs in a drawer you do not always keep locked. The coat drew what was mine to draw and she reached out and put her hand, my hand, on my wrist where the mark sits. She squeezed once like a woman acknowledging that sometimes the burn is not chemistry. I turned my face away from the toy. The air filled my mouth and I did not die on it.\n\nDelia pointed at the pallet and I saw how the triangle had been made with a stencil, not a hand. It had been repeated with precision where there had been none anywhere else. The runes that frightened Eloise had a source you could clean. I chalked over it again, stitch and stitch, not because chalk can undo unreasonable men but because chalk is cheap and marks walls well. Nate muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll find who brings these boards and they will forget where they keep their lighter,\u201d and I did not tell him that vengeance is best spent on tools. I let him have it. He needed a job.\n\nWe pulled and we pulled and we stacked tiles on a pallet that had never asked to be better. The green in them was deeper than the morning\u2019s and the veins told a different story, a longer sentence about patience and irritation and the grace of not letting a thing you did once for spectacle turn into a habit. The firefighters came late not because they are lazy but because this town is held together with too few men in hats and too many fires. They stared and then they pretended they were not impressed and then one of them took a cuff and said, \u201cIf you have seven of these I will never again have to explain to a rookie why their eyebrows hurt,\u201d and I said, \u201cCome by the shop when your hands are clean.\u201d\n\nWhen the bale was over, when the heat had become agreeable to the degree that makes it almost not itself, the boy from Thirteenth appeared like a fox who had been told there were eggs and had come to check even if you had not told him gently. He had the sculpture, the tails lifted like flags in disdain of the hour. He had stitched scraps of the old municipal tarp into flanks and he had riveted pieces of hard plastic into tendons. The tile-heart glowed dull and dignified in its chest. He set the fox down near the stack and it shivered like fire does when it has been convinced to remember it can be light without showing off. He didn\u2019t speak. He looked at the men in hats like he knew they had names they never tell anyone because those names are tender. He looked at me as if he had promised himself a future that required me to be alive.\n\n\u201cYou going to put one of those green squares in my garage?\u201d Nate asked, which was as close to admiration as he is structured to be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put one in the bottom of the duct you haven\u2019t had time to fix for three months,\u201d I said, sweet as chili. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to invoice you a number so small you will be insulted and try to pay more, and then you will take me out to the brownfield and show me where the fence has been cut twice and you will pretend you didn\u2019t see it until I saw it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d he said with dignity. He deserves a church for his dignity. He will never get one.\n\nDelia put a hand on my arm that felt like approval disguised as warning. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to scale this,\u201d she said, the we on her tongue and the policy in her shoulder, \u201cyou will need more jars, more hands, and fewer speeches. You will make enemies that are boring. Bureaucracy isn\u2019t a dragon you can charm. It\u2019s a fungus. You like fungi? You have to if you plan to stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am excellent at fungi,\u201d I said. \u201cI live in old buildings.\u201d\n\nWe stood there in our coats not admiring the sheen the fire had left on the night. The bale hissed when it found a wet bit and then stopped when it realized we weren\u2019t going to let it use the sound to distract us. Someone drove by and yelled something about witches that could have, in a good translation, meant thank you. The fox tilted its ten tails toward me and I put my hand on its head and it sank a fraction into the weight of me, like it had agreed to live in my city as long as we fed it the right kind of fire.\n\nAfter, after the after, when I had gone home and set the coat on the hook and my hands were steady again for almost three whole minutes, I took the fused fish out of my pocket and set it on the mirror. It looked cheap and shameful and I wanted to throw it into the deepest part of the river and dare the gulls to carry it back. The mirror made it into something else\u2014not prettier, and not excused. It made it into a lesson with a shape that could be taught. She stood behind me in the glass and we did not banter because we had both had enough of audiences. We stood like women in a kitchen after a wake, holding each other\u2019s elbows, telling each other with our bones that we have to eat in the morning and not eat fire.\n\nThe days that followed were busy in the way falls are busy when you\u2019ve dammed a creek for years and then give it a sluice. Tiles went out and not all of them came home to be cured on my table; people took them and thought to warm them on their own radiators and learned what happens when you try to rush a spell like you rush a stew. I replaced two with a smile and a lecture and one with a soft scold that made a woman cry in a way that made me leave her a cookie under the tile when I delivered it. Pastor Lennox put one by the furnace vent in the church basement and then on Sunday said nothing about it from the pulpit and that silence did a strange good. Eloise told me that there was a man in a long thread who had read three scientific abstracts about combustion and planned to use them to scold me in public; she printed the abstracts, highlighted the parts he would misuse, and carried them in her purse like a war prayer. Nate found the pallets with the triangle stencil and we followed them back to a lot where a man with a flag affixed to his truck in a way that hurt flag and truck both was willing to hold a match in front of us and ask if we felt safer. He did not meet my eyes when I stepped past him and drew chalk on his tailgate like a woman teaching a dog not to bark in the night.\n\nSome of the plastic cult, if they were that and not just a noise with hands, lost interest because we made it unglamorous. Some stuck around and carved sloppy triangles into snowbanks and plastic picnic tables and men\u2019s bathroom stalls, and the portion of my soul that got good at ignoring graffiti at sixteen put on work boots and kept working. Two boys came by the shop with cheeks pink from choosing that hour of night to be outside, and they put down a sack full of cigarette butts like they were paying tithes. \u201cWe don\u2019t smoke,\u201d one said defensively. \u201cWe just pick up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do both,\u201d I said, handing them a tile they could take home to their mother as evidence of what they had been doing instead of what she thought. \u201cBut if you do both I will make you scrub my back alley with a toothbrush until you grow old.\u201d\n\nThey grinned with that particular seam of malice that lives next to sweetness in adolescents and that fuels revolutions when we manage to aim it correctly. The boy with the fox brought me a drawing that made me undo my coat because my chest had suddenly become too crowded: a road made of tiles, running along the river, children hopscotching with their lungs clear, their mothers chatting in a language of relief I have been trying to learn my whole life. \u201cIt\u2019s not to scale,\u201d he said, as if he had disappointed me, and I told him to leave the scale to the fish.\n\nAnd then the river decided to give me a gift I did not know how to receive and could not refuse. Gideon called at dawn when the light had just started to remember that there is a distinction between sky and water worth noting. His voice had a rasp in it I had not heard since the winter the car went under and never came up where it was supposed to. \u201cWe found one,\u201d he said, and he did not apologize for making me the kind of woman who is summoned by that sentence. \u201cNot him,\u201d he added, and the relief went through me like a flood that doesn\u2019t sweep things so much as rearrange them kindly. \u201cBut close enough. You\u2019ll want to see the way the streak sits on the windshield. You\u2019ll want to hear the trap loosen when we bring it up. You\u2019ll want to tell me if the river is being generous or cruel.\u201d\n\nThe Retort ticked as if it were listening. The coat waited on its hook like a dog who knows it will not be taken for a walk and graciously doesn\u2019t hold a grudge. I put on my boots. I put the marble in my pocket. I wrote a note for Etta and shoved it under her door where it would catch on the mat. I told Aunt Sable nothing, because she would know and be furious, and then forgive me in a tone that would pour molasses into my ears and make me feel twelve. I went where I always go when something old is about to come up: to the bank behind the old factory where the ground remembers permission to be unstable.\n\nGideon stood with his back to the truck crane that was doing its very best to pretend it knew this river and its temper. The men he had borrowed for the pull had that bowed head you only see at gravesides and in kitchens when babies are newly discovered. The cable slithered down into the brown and then tautened like a hymn. When the car came up it was so ordinary I had to close my eyes and make it something else to be able to bear looking at it. It was a mid-aughts sedan the color of bad rain. The algae had made lace along the dash. The glass had gone green in the way glass goes green when it has been promised a home underwater and then betrayed. The windshield streak he had spoken about was there\u2014a smear like something written and wiped away in a hurry.\n\nOn the hood someone had scratched the triangle years ago and had done a bad job. The base was intact. The point was blunted. The line through it had been hesitant. It had not been the symbol from the pallets. It had been an attempt by a person who had spent a lot of time waiting in this car and was trying to make their boredom into a geometry. In the passenger footwell, wrapped in a half-disintegrated grocery bag like an aunt who refused to go to church with bare arms, there was a tin with my mother\u2019s initials on it. You never recover from your mother\u2019s handwriting; it continues to instruct you about the shape of letters long after she stops correcting you at the table.\n\nGideon let me retrieve it. That is what love looks like in my town sometimes; men let women pull things out of the river that might break them, because the women will do it anyway and this way the men get to stand near enough to catch their elbows if they sway. The tin was light in the way of tins, which is to say it felt like an insult until you remembered it holds weight that is not measured in ounces. I opened it on the bank with my thighs bracing my elbows so I wouldn\u2019t scatter whatever was inside into the water like the ending to a tasteful movie. There was a photograph of me and my father on the day the dock we didn\u2019t own seemed to belong to us because we were so loud. There was a scrap of a map with a circle around the bend where we were standing, as if by circling a place you could persuade it not to misbehave. There was a piece of chalk. There was a key with no tag. There was a note. I recognized the stroke of my mother\u2019s angry cursive from the loop in the J.\n\nJune, it said, as if she had known where the tin would go and who would one day fish it up with hands that knew more than her twelve-year-old\u2019s had. If you are reading this, I am not mad at you for going to the river. Nobody will tell you this but the river listens when you aren\u2019t talking. Your father loved it wrong and he loved it right and both things can be true. Do not let them convince you that fire and water are enemies. People say that when they mean they don\u2019t want to have to learn to hold more than one kind of danger. Use the key for something besides leaving. Your Aunt Sable will pretend she knew about this tin and she did not, because I did not tell her, because sometimes you have to keep a secret to keep a person. I am sorry. I am not sorry.\n\nThere was no postscript. I put the tin back together in the order it had greeted me because I am a superstitious woman when it comes to sequences, and then I put it under my coat as if it needed warming. Gideon watched my face with the professional pity of a man who has lost enough to make him good at it and not so much that he has made a performance of his capacity. \u201cGenerous,\u201d he said, and I nodded because he was right. It is generous to give a thing back even if it is not the exact one you begged to see. It is generous to send up a reminder that symbols are sloppy and people are sloppier and you can spend your life scolding them for it or you can make an oven and teach the town how to feed it.\n\nOn the way home the road hummed under my tires like it had something to add and was waiting to be asked nicely. I took the long way by the Nestl\u00e9 grounds and chalked a sentence on the wall where the cutlery words had once been. The cutlery was gone; someone had come and collected it, perhaps with dreams of art or signs. The sentence had to be rewritten three times because when I tried to make it pretty the chalk broke, and when I made it ordinary it held. We will not throw the hard parts away, I wrote finally, because you can\u2019t. We will embed them. We will stand on them. We will learn to like the sound our feet make when they meet the proof.\n\nThat night I did a strange thing and I do not know whether it was wise. I took the key from the tin and I pressed it into the tile I had made the second night with the vein like a wrist. The tile took the impression like a good pupil and the key came away with a tiny kiss, green dust on its teeth. I put it on a cord and I put the cord around my neck because sometimes you have to leave a thing where your pulse can argue with it. She watched me do it and did not laugh. \u201cYou going to wear that when you go see the man who thinks burning wrong is a personality?\u201d she asked, and I told her, \u201cYes, and I\u2019m going to hand him a tile and dare him to stand on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake him stand on it in front of his friends,\u201d she said, pragmatic as kindling, and this, too, is love of a sort.\n\nI slept and woke and slept again because some days that is the work. I did not dream about cars or bales or gulls, which felt like a mercy. I dreamed about floors. Not pretty floors. Floors that have seen winter boots and babies and the corners of couches being dragged by women who don\u2019t have help. Floors embedded with green squares that hold the breath of the city so its children do not have to. I dreamed about the boy\u2019s fox skittering down Oneida with ten tails and a beating tile and people stepping back to make room without looking up from their bags. I dreamed about Eloise\u2019s hair at rest. I dreamed about a mirror that did not need to show me both to make me believe we could be two and one without smudging. In the morning the marble felt light in my pocket, the way things feel when they have taken their own advice and rested. I brewed tea that tasted like the season had remembered cinnamon by accident. I opened the shop. I stitched a hem for a girl getting married at the church that wants to pretend it dislikes me. I soldered a lamp that had belonged to a grandfather who did like me. I labeled a jar evidence of a boundary you kept. I waited for the next thing to need both of us, and when it came\u2014because it always comes\u2014I put on the coat without apology and I did not look away when the heat smiled.Chapter Eight\n\nThe day after the tin, the town discovered a talent for walking around the word incinerator like it was a sleeping dog. Flyers sprouted on telephone poles with words like thermal recovery and energy from waste and artist's rendering in which a building with no right angles glowed benevolently while a family of four held hands and did not cough. A man in a jacket so close to navy it made him vanish if he stood too near the police chief introduced himself to Eloise in the hallway outside the council chamber and said things like public-private partnership and pilot facility and then said my name like we had been introduced in a room I had accidentally missed. He had a smile that could pick a lock and an eye for a camera that didn\u2019t need a lens. His card said Morrison & Kent, Regional Development. The card was heavy in a way that asked to be kept as a coaster.\n\nEloise slid the card across my counter with two fingers like she was returning a knife to a drawer. \u201cHe\u2019s got a stack of policy white papers taller than his ego,\u201d she said, which on a different day might have been funny. \u201cHe says he likes the tiles. He says there\u2019s a way to scale them that involves concrete and fencing and a smokestack we can rename a flute if we want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do want to rename things,\u201d I said, and flipped the card like a coin and let it land face down because I am childish when it comes to fate. \u201cI don\u2019t want a flute that only plays one note and calls it a symphony.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants to meet,\u201d she said, glancing at the door as if the bell might tell on her. \u201cHe wants to shake your hand. He wants to learn the word Retort and file it under local color.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the coat,\u201d I said. \u201cIf he puts a match on my counter I\u2019m going to make him stand on a tile until he decides whether ash is something he respects.\u201d\n\nAunt Sable sat me down with coffee that had been on the burner long enough to develop opinions and told me the one story I had never let her tell properly. It came slowed by age and sped by impatience. My mother loved a dock more than a pew because a dock never pretended it could hold what it couldn\u2019t. She loved my father because he wore the same face whether he was watching a storm or a stove. She hated the car because it made leaving too easy. She kept the tin because it made staying a task, not a default. The night the river took the car, it took everything that had been kept between them like towels. It returned rotten fish and a hubcap and a story that the town folded into itself the way a person folds a letter before they throw it out and then retrieves it, smooths it, and decides to keep it a little longer. \u201cYour mother could have become a ruin,\u201d Sable said, watching the steam from her cup as if it might deliver a verdict. \u201cShe chose not to. She chose work. She chose, sometimes, to burn small things before they could become bonfires. She messed that up as often as she succeeded, because we are messy people. She did not tell me about the tin because she knew I would hide at least one of the pieces someplace I would later forget.\u201d\n\nI wanted to be angry with my mother for trusting a river with her note when I was twelve and so hungry for stories that weren\u2019t about loss, and I wanted not to be because the note had reached my hands like it had walked there. I wanted to be angry with Sable for not telling me sooner about the nights she had sat up with my mother counting the seconds between thunder and lightning and deciding when to move furniture away from windows. I wanted not to be, because she had chosen to be the kind of woman I could call when my other self said three nights. It is exhausting to want the fair versions of people and to keep choosing the real ones anyway.\n\nMorrison from Morrison & Kent had the decency to call me June and the indecency to take in my shop like it was a stage set. He saw the jars and the coat with his eyes and the Retort with his pupils. He spoke in paragraphs that have killed more towns than storms, verbs that make nouns do labor they didn\u2019t sign up for. \u201cWe see an opportunity to integrate community-based solutions,\u201d he said, which translated to: your mess is an aesthetic we can monetize. \u201cWe see an opportunity to localize control within a regional footprint,\u201d which meant: we will put a fence around your air and sell it back to you with a bow. He admired the tile the way you admire something a child has made before you usher it to the refrigerator, smile, and go back to the real conversation. He touched the green and didn\u2019t notice the way it thrummed because he doesn\u2019t live with his hands.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll call it a kiln so we think pottery,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll call it cogeneration so we think winter sweaters and not smoke.\u201d I poured tea because I am the kind of witch who believes hospitality is a spell strong enough to make men talk true. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me innovative so I think I\u2019m important and then you\u2019ll file me under color and call my name if there\u2019s a ribbon to cut.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe prefer the term energy hub,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cImagine the message. No more fires in alleys. No more confusion. We collect, we process, we capture. You keep your tiles. We keep your city\u2019s air clean. The grant money likes us. The state likes numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe river doesn\u2019t like fences,\u201d I said, because there is always a point at which you have to line up your allegiances out loud. \u201cAnd neither do I. Capturing breath is not the same as denying it. I will not build you a pretty chimney.\u201d\n\nHe did what men like him do when faced with women like me: he smiled like our dance had been charming and announced he would see me at the town hall meeting. He left a brochure that smelled like ink and confidence and I used it to level a stool that has always leaned just enough to make you feel alert.\n\nDelia Mott took the brochure and wrote Not a flute, a pipe snake on the cover in pencil so light you had to squint. She stood in my doorway, which had become a threshold for women bringing me unsentimental truth, and told me she had colleagues who liked Morrison\u2019s hair and colleagues who liked my jars and some who liked both and none who liked the river when it got opinionated. \u201cYou\u2019ll need numbers that don\u2019t blush,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a demonstration that doesn\u2019t smell like babies will later cough. They\u2019re going to bring a stack of tires to the meeting and call it hypothetically, and you\u2019re going to keep your face from changing when someone says dioxin and looks at you like they\u2019re asking whether you\u2019d like a second cookie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hold a straight face,\u201d I said. \u201cI have made hems on prom dresses so poorly conceived they were in violation of a building code and I did not lecture once.\u201d\n\nShe almost smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll bring a meter. You bring your patience. We\u2019ll let the town decide which smoke it likes living with.\u201d\n\nThe boy from Thirteenth sat cross-legged on my floor with the fox and told me he had a name he wasn\u2019t born with and would like me to use. \u201cRook,\u201d he said, and making the k made his mouth pleased. \u201cLike the bird and like the game, but mostly like the bird. The bird likes trash. The bird knows how to look at it different.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook,\u201d I repeated, and let it settle in my mouth as if it were a seed that had chosen me. He laced wire into the fox\u2019s shoulder while he talked about a woman with bracelets who had asked for a dolphin again and he had said, \u201cNo ma\u2019am, I don\u2019t do mammals,\u201d and then felt bad and offered her a fish that looked like a knife. I gave him a cuff I had lined with gold and he put it on like a royal and then pretended not to feel taller.\n\nWe set the date for the town hall and I spent the morning making sure the Retort did not have a grudge about being asked to perform. The coat hung on its hook like a person listening for their name under noise. I cut more tiles than I needed and not enough for what I wanted. I wrote a list in the way my mother taught me to write lists\u2014verbs first, then nouns, then people\u2014and tried not to read it as a spell. I wrote: bring jars, bring Delia, bring patience, bring stitching for when men say machines and mean women, bring tea. I did not write bring the other me because she is not a thing I set out anymore; she is a weather that arrives when addressed and when ignored both. I put the tin with the key in the drawer under the register where I keep the money and the candy I pretend I don\u2019t like. I told it to behave. It didn\u2019t answer, which is how you know you\u2019re dealing with an heirloom and not a demon.\n\nThe town hall was held in the old gym because it is the only room that can hold our collective self-importance. The bleachers creaked under people who do not believe in bleachers. Eloise had her pen out like a wand and her hair tacked back like a decision. Pastor Lennox had ceded the front row to Etta, who had brought a string bag with two oranges in it and two small stones that I knew were intended to be thrown only if someone said witch in a way that made it unignorable. Morrison & Kent had set up a banner with a logo that was attempting to be a wave and a lightning bolt and instead looked like a checkmark stretched wrong. Rook stood by the door with the fox, because we had agreed it should come to meetings like a dog you trust not to bite even if someone deserves it.\n\nWe had rehearsed without saying we had rehearsed. Nate had loaned us the small roll-off and the ugly duct. Delia had brought a meter that made grown men look like they were considering a proposal. I had stacked the tiles within reach like arguments I would only use if provoked. The firefighters hung at the back in posture that said we will not be recruited and then, under it, a posture that said we might, because we prefer work to talk.\n\nMorrison spoke in the generous lower register men save for good wine and civic pride. He had slides full of arrows, and arrows are always lying. He had numbers that made smoke look like the kind of cloud you nap on. He said partnership to mean control and resilience to mean purchase order. He said Ms. Weaver twice in a tone that had respect wrapped around condescension like pastry around a cheap sausage. He gestured at the Retort like he had introduced us to each other and we had been grateful.\n\nI did not interrupt him because the only thing worse than a man with good hair is a woman who lets him have an easy villain. When it was my turn, I did not look at the cameras. I looked where Gideon had planted himself, one hand on the railing because he does not like burning in rooms. I spoke the way you speak to a river when you are unsure whether it is asleep or only pretending. I said we built this with hands you know. I said we are already capturing what you cannot make not burn. I said you can come to the lean-to and put your own breath on the glass and watch it fog and clear. I said my name. I did not say witch. I did not say no to the plant. I said we will not be eaten by our solution.\n\nWe lit the Retort. The ducting hummed forward like a horse that had learned the command in another language but trusted the hand. The jars fogged and cleared in that steady measure that has become my favorite rhythm. The heat went where it was supposed to because we had laid the story ahead of it like a track. Delia watched the meter the way musicians watch a conductor they don\u2019t fully like but have agreed to obey. She held up a finger when someone in a hat shouted about toxins, then displayed a line on a screen that refused to move into panic. Morrison smiled in a way that said, charming, but asked for comparison. His men brought a barrel and a stack of what they called farm film: plastic that has seen hay and sun and a litany of hungers. They asked if we would mind. Eloise said go ahead, and her voice had a wire in it.\n\nThey lit the barrel the wrong way on purpose, and if you think that sentence isn\u2019t a spell then you haven\u2019t lived in a town where men create their own villains for sport. The fire took gleeful umbrage. It produced the particular cough of heat that is half chemical, half affront. Delia\u2019s meter began to show its numbers. People leaned back into their coats and into their opinions. I felt the coat on the hook unlatch itself, which is a trick I don\u2019t recommend allowing unless you know for a fact you can carry both yourself and your other without dropping your tea.\n\nShe stepped into me without theatrics because the gym doesn\u2019t like them unless there\u2019s a band. We put our hand\u2014the one with the mark\u2014on the duct and the Retort took the yowl from the barrel the way a grandmother takes a toddler who has decided a tantrum is the only way to tell the truth. The jars experimented with blowing their tops and then remembered themselves. The fire made a last bid for romance and writhed. I watched the room feel the difference between spectacle and function. If you are lucky in your life, you get to perform that reveal twice: once for a town, once for yourself. I breathed in for the sake of the meter and out for the sake of my lungs.\n\nMorrison did not get hotter, which is the problem with men like him. He stayed even and smiled like he had made this happen. He asked about scale and costs and the inevitability of waste and whether I had considered licensing. He offered to help with permitting for a larger hood and a friendlier word for capture. He suggested a ribbon-cutting in spring. He said he would send over a team to evaluate. Only once did he slip and say incineration, and then he corrected to thermal reclamation with the grace of a dancer who never lets you see the turn.\n\nAfter, in the shuffle that follows demonstrations and before the fights reassert themselves, a man with the kind of face you find on high school photographs in cases in hallways asked me for a tile for his mother. He whispered that she can\u2019t breathe in summer and he can carry a square better than a machine, and I handed him one with my mother\u2019s name under my breath because sometimes prayers are logistics. The firefighters came and asked for cuffs and did not bother to pretend they were being charitable. Pastor Lennox put his hand on the Retort like a man laying hands on a congregant who has confessed something heavy and wants the weight redistributed, not removed. Eloise spoke quietly to Delia in a language of numbers and favors. Rook slipped the fox through the legs of men who did not look down and smiled when no one tripped.\n\nI saw him, then. The he from the woman with the sunburn and the errands and the confession she had practically stapled to my counter. He had a mustache that belonged to a different mouth and a jacket poor men buy when they decide to look rich once and never again. He stayed at the edges of the crowd where people who collect allies stand. He laughed when Morrison talked about jobs and nodded when the barrel complained and looked bored when we made the Retort hum. He caught my eye and didn\u2019t drop it. He was not the man who cut the fence; he was the man who tells that man when to arrive and with what tools. In a country song he\u2019d be the one who drives the truck to the line and leaves it idling.\n\nHe left before I could decide if I was going to tell him my name and ask for his, and I let him. Chasing men like that is a way to forget why you built anything. Aunt Sable says you can lose a decade in one pair of eyes that make you feel like you are a version of yourself that would be fun at dinner.\n\nThat night, after the gym had been returned to a room for sweating without stakes and the Retort was asleep enough to count as resting and the tile stack was three squares taller than exhaustion, she and I stood in the kitchen with the mirror face-up like a thinned lake. The coat hung a little lower because wet air makes even magic heavier. I did what I had been practicing doing without rehearsing: I held both our gazes at once and did not flinch at the overlay. \u201cI want a braid,\u201d I said, which on paper looks romantic and in practice sounds like two women deciding about bone.\n\n\u201cYou want to make a schedule,\u201d she said, because our humor sits on the same stubborn shelf. \u201cYou want Tuesdays you and Thursdays me. You want me to punch a clock. You want to be able to blame me when you say yes to more fire than you can digest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to not wake up with sugar on my teeth and the triangle on my brick,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to be able to say to my aunt that I am done outsourcing my scorch. I want to stand in the alley with the coat on and feel you decide to stay in my hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen stop pretending I am only your badness,\u201d she said, and there it was; the particular nasty of truth that loves me enough to tell me I am a coward. \u201cYou call me when you want speed and you call me when you want courage and you call me when a man says he knows better what to do with heat and you want to look frightening while you defy him. It would be sweet if it weren\u2019t lazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will learn to look frightening with a needle,\u201d I said, and laughed at myself because I already do.\n\nWe braided without string. We braided with breath. We braided with the sound of the Retort cooling and the distant plop of something large in the river deciding to surface then changing its mind because even fish are ambivalent sometimes. I took a strand of hair and burned it in the flame of a candle we had made with leftover paraffin and beeswax I bought from a man on a back road who carves saints out of stumps and never learned to charge appropriately. She took a bit of ash and traced a line on my wrist. I took the key from my neck and pressed it to the mirror until it fogged and cleared, and she held the mirror steady in case I shook. When we were done, we looked like the same woman to anybody who would photograph us for the newspaper. Inside, a door clicked. A small one. The kind people use when they pretend they are not leaving or entering. We stood there for a whole minute and breathed. I do not know yet whether it will hold forever or until spring. That is honest. That is the best I can give you when you ask for permanence in a town where almost everything floats.\n\nTwo days later, because I had made a braid and the world wanted to tug it to see if it would hold, the plastic cult\u2014which really is only three people and a Facebook page and a penchant for drawing triangles on picnic tables while waiting for their fries\u2014announced a parade. They called it Crackle Walk and designed a logo with a match sticking up like a flag from a trash can. They said they would bring their bags and their beliefs and their lighters and their right to air, and they met in the parking lot of the shuttered video store where nostalgia knows how to make itself look like policy. I put on the coat and did not bring the Retort because there is no arguing with spectacle except by not feeding it.\n\nRook came because he had made signs for the teenagers who wanted to walk but not admit they were walking for anything other than an excuse not to do homework. Etta came because she does not know how to stay home when a town is making a choice in public. Pastor Lennox came because he insists on testifying with his face even when his voice isn\u2019t asked for. Gideon came because he had a suspicion that someone would attempt to make a fire on or near a vehicle. Delia did not come because she would be accused of taking a side and she is not embarrassed to tell me she sometimes sits in her truck and eats a sandwich while the town burns or learns. Eloise came because she comes to everything she can possibly come to, and when she cannot, she sends a woman who is shorter and angrier.\n\nThey had a barrel. Of course they had a barrel. They had three. They had triangles painted in a stencil style that I now recognized like the handwriting of a boy who has copied a phrase until he has convinced himself he invented it. They had slogans that would be more fun if they didn\u2019t sound like boys putting their hands in the air at the back of class because making noise is a way to make sure you don\u2019t have to listen. They had a man in the jacket who will never be rich, calling phrases like freedom and choice and witch but on our side now, which is the irony I\u2019m not sure the universe will ever get tired of.\n\nI walked up and held a tile like a communion and the way the teenagers looked at me made the inside of my elbow hurt. \u201cPick one,\u201d I said. \u201cStand on it. Light your barrel. See if you like the way the air feels when your toes are telling the truth.\u201d Two of them did it because two is the correct number for this town. The third boy made a loud speech about lies and marbles and the river probably being a gimmick and then his lighter failed because sometimes God is a cheap Bic. The tile under their feet hummed and they looked down like they had just learned that floor is a verb.\n\nOne of the triangle-men\u2014the ones with mustaches they grew as if the seventies had been a country they were patriotic for\u2014stepped up to me with a match he\u2019d been rolling between his fingers in a way that indicated both habit and desire for attention. He held it so close to my coat that I smelled the sulfur in the moment before the flare and my braid tightened like a girl flexing her hands. The coat took the heat and held it and cooled it and I did not move, again not out of bravery, out of stubbornness. I pressed the tile into his chest, and he took it because it was either that or admit he didn\u2019t know what to do with his hands. \u201cStand on that,\u201d I said, and he did, because even men who dislike witchcraft like instructions when everyone is watching.\n\nThe barrels burned small because we didn\u2019t give them oxygen to be dramatic. The tiles brightened. The breath fogged the not-jar of the air and then, because physics agrees to be reasonable in public sometimes, lifted. The men with the triangles ran out of slogans and stood with their hands out, waiting to be told what to do next. Eloise told them to pick up their cigarette butts. Etta told them to take off their hats if they were coming into the co-op for chili. Pastor Lennox told them nothing because he had decided to take my hint about the silence that works as well as any sermon. Rook ran the fox through the barrel smoke and laughed when it didn\u2019t cough.\n\nThat night the river did its trick with the moon. It doesn\u2019t reverse unless the wind force-feeds it the lake, but it can look like it has decided to. It wore a skin that made me want to step into it for the sheer meanness of its calm. I took the key out of the tin and went to the Nestl\u00e9 wall and considered the locks this town has that are worth opening and the ones that need to stay stuck because getting through them would only let out things that can\u2019t be taught manners. I chalked a small box on the brick and made a mark and another, then pressed the key into the mortar like you teach a word to a child by putting it on their tongue. The brick accepted and then rejected me politely, the way some women do when you are trying to get them to let you escort them and they have never needed the arm you are offering. I laughed because there is a kind of prayer that looks exactly like a witch giggling alone in an alley.\n\nGideon found me there and did not pretend he had been out to buy milk. He had the look he gets when he sees the river carrying a promise only he will notice because the rest of us are busy with land. \u201cYou ever going to put a tile on the boat?\u201d he asked, casual in the way of men who are not casual about anything. \u201cMight be I don\u2019t want to be the only thing that breathes right on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put one under the pump,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll put one where your foot goes when you pull a thing from the water and you don\u2019t want your right knee to tell you cruel stories for three days after.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if that had been the right answer and then, like a man admitting something to a woman he sees too clearly to manipulate, said, \u201cI sat on my porch last night and I thought about your father. I thought about the way he laughed in the bar like someone had told him a joke so close to true it made him generous. I thought about the miles of water between where that car first decided to be a fish and where we found it. I thought about how heavy things become not because of their metal but because of the place they live. I thought about your mother\u2019s handwriting. I thought, if I had a daughter, would I let her read it. I don\u2019t know what the good answer is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good answer is that you don\u2019t get to decide what she reads,\u201d I said, and laughed into my scarf so the words came back warm. \u201cYou get to decide whether you hand it to her or the river does. The river is worse at timing. Sometimes she is perfect in spite of herself.\u201d\n\nWe walked back up Oneida with tiles tucked under our coats like contraband and the sky doing that winter thing where it pretends it will snow if we all wish hard enough. I put one tile on the library steps before I unlocked my door because I want the air in there to be kind to the children who think the stacks are a forest and the roof is the sky. I put one in the foyer of my building where Mrs. Calabrese has started peeking and pretending she approves. I put one under the table where I work so the breath I chain to glass has a reason to stay. I wrote a word on the mirror I had never let myself write because it felt like a confession that might dissolve under heat. Home, I wrote, and waited for it to fog and clear, and it did both.\n\nWhen Morrison called the next morning, he did not apologize. He did not congratulate. He asked if he could send his team to measure and photograph and advise. I told him to bring coffee and gloves and to come ready to sand duct edges so nobody lost a knuckle. He did not laugh. He said a time. I said the door would be unlocked. Then I called Delia and told her to park across the street with her meter and a face so unamused the sun would move over one block rather than shine right on us. I called Eloise and told her to bring the kind of pen that bleeds through paper because we would need to sign things that don\u2019t let us out easy. I told Rook to stay home because I did not want to explain to corporate men why the fox had better posture than their boss. I told Aunt Sable nothing because it is good to give an old woman a morning where she is not required to remind a younger one to not catch fire unnecessarily.\n\nThey came with hard hats and shoes none of us would wear to do work you plan to sweat in. They came with their own words for duct and flange and heat and none of those words included blessing and patience. I made them tea with honey from the man on the back road and let them sit on my stools, which are the kind of stools that make you tell the truth because they wobble if you lie. They measured my mouth. They clicked their tongues at my jars. They took photographs of the coat as if it were an antique that had wandered down from a museum storeroom and gotten ideas. One of them, a woman with earrings shaped like letters, asked me how I stitched the lining and I told her with a story and a little bit of science. She did not roll her eyes. A man named Nick braced a sheet of steel while Nate drilled and the bit screamed and nobody yelled witch even once. It was progress in a way that felt like a tile curing, slow, then quick, then sudden and obvious.\n\nAfter their visit, Morrison stood at my door with his hands in his coat like a boy who hasn\u2019t learned where to put them when he wants to ask to be let in. He said all the things polite people say when they have failed to win a round and are trying not to show their discomfort with not being beloved. He started to ask me something and then swallowed it, which is either manners or strategy and I am not always good at telling the difference. He settled on, \u201cDo you ever wish you were just a tailor,\u201d and I told him, \u201cI wish a lot of things,\u201d and then I told him a thing my mother wrote in a note I did not invite him to see: that fire and water are not enemies, that people use enemies when they are lazy. He nodded like he understood and then went away like he did not.\n\nThat night, because the world enjoys testing knots when your hands are chapped and you only want to go to bed, the wind decided to come down Oneida with its shoulders. The bags on porches sang their ugly little songs. The bins clattered and grew hungry. Somewhere, a boy with a lighter and an empty had an idea. Somewhere else, a woman looked up at the ceiling and wondered if it was worth moving the couch. I locked my door, then unlocked it, then put my hand on the Retort like a person telling their dog it is time to go out. She was already standing. The coat slid from the hook and didn\u2019t bother to pretend it needed me. We went to the alley. We breathed. We waited. We made our mouths agreeable to the kind of smoke this town refuses to admit it likes, and then we turned that liking into tile, into floor, into a sentence we will stand on until our knees give out and we are replaced by a woman who knows how to thread a needle and convince heat that the better story is the one where it behaves.Chapter Ten hid its face behind a sheet-metal sky and let the town find its breath in the seam between freeze and thaw that makes buildings cough. The river went flat as a lie told too often and then rucked up without warning, and I understood we were in that part of winter where decisions get made by people who think weather is a conversation partner. I woke with my mouth tasting like solder and tea, not sugar, which meant the braid was holding. She hovered at the edge of my hand the way cats hover at the edge of affection, and when I reached for a pin my fingers knew which self was better at picking a sliver from cloth and which was better at holding steady while heat argued. The tiles under the counter kept their hum like a choir with sense, not ambition. Outside, the street wore a crust of salt and disappointment and the little birds did their frantic hop-growl-hop dance in the gutter like what they wanted was entirely reasonable and the world just needed to get out of their way.\n\nEloise stopped by first, not because she likes mornings but because she had been up all night reading a stack of documents taller than the fern she has kept alive in her office by threatening it. She had Morrison\u2019s card bent into a tool for opening stubborn jars and a look that told me her hair had won. \u201cThey want an MOU,\u201d she said without ceremony, as though I were a person who keeps my initials in a drawer ready to be affixed to something ornamental and then regretted. \u201cThey want to call it a pilot, but it smells like permanence with addenda. They want language about compliance and they want us to say thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can say thank you without meaning it,\u201d I offered, pouring coffee into a cup that had been chipped back when my mother thought she was going to move to a city where women wear lipstick to the post office. \u201cI cannot say incinerator with a smile. I can say Retort so many times it becomes a lullaby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to accept their money,\u201d she said with the lighter kind of despair that comes when you are lying to yourself for strategic reasons. \u201cWe could do it with grants and a bake sale and my retirement. Don\u2019t make a face. I\u2019m only half joking. I don\u2019t want to sell our breath to a man who calls smoke an opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut the tile on your desk,\u201d I said, because sometimes you give your friends work that looks like superstition and they will do it if they love you enough. \u201cStand on it when you read. It will keep you honest with yourself about which part of your mouth is speaking.\u201d\n\nShe stood. She did as I asked. She closed her eyes, which in Eloise is a prayer. When she opened them again she had that pinched look like a woman who has decided to carry something heavy to the top of a hill out of spite. \u201cThere\u2019s a hearing in Albany,\u201d she said. \u201cDelia wants you. Morrison wants you. Your aunt wants you to stay home and boil bones for broth because she knows travel eats you. I want you to come and be useful and to also be small. I hate that those are the choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to be small,\u201d I said. \u201cI learned it early. I prefer loud when loud is a tool, but I can be folded and put in a bag like a sweater if it gets us past the door.\u201d\n\nAfter she left I made a floor where there had been one, only now it had an opinion. I set three tiles in the threshold and grouted them with slurry and patience. They looked like a lake you could bring inside without getting the rugs in trouble. I made a sign on a piece of slate that used to be a menu in a caf\u00e9 that sold feeling instead of food: Step however you like, it said. Notice the difference. People came in and did. Old men from the barbershop hopped like children then pretended they hadn\u2019t. A girl with a backpack set too heavy for her bones stepped on the green and got weepy in the way you do when you\u2019ve been holding your breath for longer than a minute and someone says you don\u2019t have to. Rook came in with the fox and made it bow to the square politely, which set the tone.\n\nRook\u2019s fox had become a kind of maypole without the ringing and the fights. Children tied ribbons around the tails and some of the knots were so bad they held, because that is true of children and true of towns. He had given the creature small iron feet scavenged from a chair and the tile-heart sat just behind a piece of clear plastic that used to be the lid for a cake nobody enjoyed and everyone ate anyway. The fox did not look alive, but it looked like it had no patience for lying about its condition, and I loved it for that. Rook had started a club without saying club, and a handful of kids with cold hands and eyes too alert for their age came by after school with bags full of plastics cleaned with effort. He told them their hands mattered more than their finds and they believed him because he said it as if he expected them to argue and win.\n\nPastor Lennox came in with his tie pin misaligned and no pamphlets, which told me he had fought and perhaps lost in a room that smelled like coffee and winter boots. He put his hands on the counter the way a man puts his hands on a piano he was punished for loving when he was twelve. \u201cThe board,\u201d he said, by which he meant the five people in his church who wear responsibility like perfume, \u201care divided. They want the regional plant because the brochure has a picture of a sunset on it. They want your tiles because their grandchildren sleep better after a day with one underfoot. They want me to tell them what stewardship is, and I want to tell them it is sorting shame into the right bag and putting love in the clear bin and taking the rest to the river once a month and asking the water to tell you when you are lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can tell them we capture breath,\u201d I said, because some phrases can be loaned without losing their magic. \u201cYou can tell them I will tile your aisle if they let me, and we will see if the pews complain. You can tell them the plant wants a fence. I want a floor.\u201d\n\nHe smiled without heat and it meant more than a fervent grin would have. \u201cIf I say floor from the pulpit, Lennox & Sons will accuse me of witchcraft by way of interior design,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say ground. I will say footing. I will say we do not know how to behave with our feet. I will ask them to practice.\u201d\n\nHe left me a small bag of cash from a funeral luncheon because grief tips well and sometimes has nowhere else to put its hands. He promised me nothing and that is why I trusted him.\n\nThe he who had taught a woman to ruin her kettle the fast way sent me a message through a boy whose ears I would like to protect from a decade when men confide laziness to the nearest youth with good posture. It was a note on paper torn from a legal pad, carefully folded, the kind a man\u2019s hand does when it wants to pretend to be a gentleman. The meeting place was the old tannery; the hour was the kind that breaks a neck. Aunt Sable told me not to go in the tone she saves for when she knows I will and would like the points on her warning recorded. I wore the coat and no perfume. I told Eloise by text and she wrote back three skulls and a thumbs-up and a time she would start calling people with keys if I did not answer my phone. Gideon watched me walk by and did not stop me because he believes in me in a way that is not flattering and is entirely useful.\n\nThe tannery still exhaled ghosts of hides and labor when it got warm enough indoors for old air to remember its vows. This was not one of those nights. The frost on the windows looked like breath that had curled around a lead paint warning and decided to make art of it. He was there with two others, men with hands softer than their talk. They had jackets that had learned the smell of garages and slogans that had not learned to be ashamed of themselves yet. They did not say the word cult because men in this town only use that word for women, never for the rooms where they bring fire and a sense of grievance like it is a hand tool.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to burn the whole town,\u201d he said, which is the kind of sentence that makes you check for an exit even if you have magic. \u201cWe want to use what\u2019s there. We want to be in charge of the heat. We want to show the city it can\u2019t police everything with guilt. You have a mouth,\u201d he added, glancing at my coat in a way that made me check which part of me was the dangerous one. \u201cWe have hands. We could make something bigger than jars and tiles. We could make something tragic to be righteous about.\u201d\n\nI have learned how to be courteous when I am furious because women who live in small towns need to be good at survival on a dozen registers. \u201cYou want fires with witnesses,\u201d I said. \u201cYou want a river that will take credit for your mess. You want me at the front of your parade so when the police take pictures you can say we\u2019re in it together and you are an ally to a woman who burns.\u201d\n\nHe smiled like he had been told it looked good on him once and had never stopped. \u201cYou set it up and we\u2019ll make sure you have protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtection,\u201d I repeated, as if I had never met the word and wanted to know its preferred pronouns. \u201cFrom who?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom us,\u201d he said, and that made me laugh in a way I am not proud of. There are laughs that keep you alive and they are cruel laughs, and you try not to grow fond of them because they turn on you when you are tired.\n\nI did not bring Delia or Nate to the tannery; I brought them to the night after. I left the tannery with my hands by my sides and my back itching in the way backs itch when men you would not invite to dinner stare and try to make you into an epiphany. In my pocket the key from my mother\u2019s tin pressed a bruise into my thigh so deep I could have chalked it and called it a map. The next day Delia and I stood in the street and watched the traffic like two sisters who had decided to go for a walk in front of a battlefield. \u201cThey\u2019ll try the Retort,\u201d Delia said, adjusting her meter like a woman adjusting a necklace given by an ex she still wears because it looks better on her than on any apology. \u201cSabotage is exciting. They are bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we use law?\u201d I asked, because sometimes I like to fantasize about a system that will look down and notice our breath without us having to paint it green.\n\n\u201cWe use rope and we use neighbors and we use a camera and we use boredom against them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe let them be as dull as they are in public and then we do not give them the spice of outrage. Believe me, I hate it. I prefer lawsuits. But lawsuits are winter. They take and take and you only see the green in the spring.\u201d\n\nThey came late, thinking the darkness could be their mother. Nate and Gideon were visible and useful; I was not. I sat in the sewing chair inside with the mirror flat and the coat swung over the back like a woman tired of standing. She did not need to come but she did, because we have agreed that sometimes the theater is necessary. The men tried the door and found it latched with a thing Morrison\u2019s men would call a device and Nate calls a good decision. One climbed, as if he thought vertigo had a crush on him. He met mine instead; the window had a tile in it and the tile sang when his glove hit the frame, and he found his grip disagreeing with him because devotion to art will get in your bones if you hold it often enough. They gave up on subtlety and went for the can, and the can failed because Gideon had replaced it with water because he enjoys a joke when it is useful. They ran. We did not. Delia took photographs with a camera that is also a witness because it records numbers in the language a court likes. Nate said a sentence in a dialect made entirely of swear words and conjugations of to fix and then went home and kissed his wife and did not tell her anything.\n\nEveryone pretended not to know what had happened. That is mercy and also a bad habit. Eloise took the photographs and slid them into a folder that will only be opened if we need leverage, and leverage is one of those words I have learned to use without grimacing. The men with the stencils learned where the camera was on the light pole by my alley and drew their triangles a block away. The cracks of their symbol went shallow and the chalk wore quicker because somewhere a boy with a sleeve that can take scrubbing had decided his corner should be clean. I do not count these as victories. I count them as pauses in the kind of weather that tires you.\n\nThe blizzard came a week later, a real one, not a tantrum. It arrived overnight with the confidence of a guest who knows the spare key is under the frog on the porch. The lake gave the town its shoulder and the town bent like a woman who has learned how to carry without asking for help. The power had the decency to wait until morning to fail, and then it failed with the seriousness we expect of it. Etta\u2019s kitchen went dark and she finished the soup on a camping stove that had boiled water for arguments and reconciliations in its time. The co-op went dim and people breathed on the glass where the good bread hides and pretended that fog was a plan. The church opened its doors because that is what churches like his do even when the board wants to say something about liability. The transfer station closed and sighed in relief because the bales hate damp.\n\nI opened my door and the Retort breathed like a dragon who has agreed to be of service. The coat warmed the air in a way that made my teeth feel like they are a part of my face and not an argument. We did not burn plastic to heat people because I would like to keep being invited to parties. We burned pallets cut down to apology and scrap from a woodshop where a woman knows how to plane without swearing. We captured what needed capturing and let heat do what heat does when it is loved correctly. People came and stood on the tiles and stood near the duct and crushed their hands in their pockets and told each other stories about winters that made this one look like a kind child and then ate Etta\u2019s soup because kindness is a sedative.\n\nPastor Lennox brought blankets from the church that smelled like the cedar chest they think is a chapel. Eloise sat on a stool and fell asleep in a posture she would have fired someone for having in a meeting. Gideon stationed himself near the door like a bouncer for weather. Rook set the fox under the coat\u2019s hem in a way that made it look like an altar boy being trained to be useful and not get caught up in his own metaphor. Aunt Sable came in late with a casserole that contains at least three recipes and opinion, and she touched my face as if confirming a rumor of fever. \u201cYou keep your scalp covered when you go out,\u201d she said, which was not a request and therefore got obeyed. \u201cYou let other people put wood on your altar and do not fuss about how they stack it. This is the kind of night where pride pretends to be a coat and fails to keep you warm.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of the afternoon a boy pounded on the door with urgency that made the coat tighten. He had the particular white of a face that has met cold past polite and has the will to demand warmth from a half-sleeping town. Gideon was out the door before he finished his sentence, which was two words: he fell. The river did not look like a sentence you could read that day; it looked like grammar that had given up. I followed with the coat and a rope because you cannot stop a woman who has braided with a part of herself that knows ice better than it knows meetings. Pastor came with his hands ready to be useful and his shoulders ready to be scolded by anyone with a badge. Etta did not come because she knows that kitchens need guarding just as much as banks.\n\nThe bank behind the old factory has been trying to become a person for years. It was raw and mean and honest. Gideon had gone ahead to the point where he had thrown ropes a hundred times; he threw again and they skated in the wind like insults that refuse to land. The hole in the ice was not large. It was the size of a yes when the wrong person asks. A hat floated near the edge and that was everything. Rook, who had followed against orders I had not given and therefore could not be said to have disobeyed, put the fox down on the bank and the fox\u2019s tile glowed obediently. The light was not much. It was enough. The boy on the ice hung to a lip with a determination I recognized in my own hands when they refuse to drop a stitch. He did not call for help. He conserved.\n\nI lay flat and slid. The coat hissed at the cold but did not scold. She and I breathed like we were trying to persuade the air to remember kindness. Behind me the rope paid out with a grunt from Pastor and a curse from Aunt Sable that rolled over the river\u2019s rudeness like a quilt. Gideon worked the far shore near a tree that has opinions about men who lean on it. \u201cLeft,\u201d he called, because there are nights when language collapses to degree and distance. I went left. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and there it was, the slick lip where the boy\u2019s hands had decided to be blasphemers and not let go. I reached and the coat did that thing it does when it remembers it was stitched for this and not for photographs. Heat took the immediate frost and sent it away from the place we stood. I took his wrist. I did not say hold on because he already was. I did not say don\u2019t be afraid because fear was the coat he was wearing and it was keeping him alive.\n\nWe pulled. Rook braced his feet on a branch and leaned like he had been born with rope in his family. The Pastor did not pray because he had his hands full. Gideon did not swear because he felt the presence of women. The boy\u2019s elbow slipped and then caught and his mouth opened for a scream that did not arrive because his breath belonged to the river for a second and then to me. We got him out, elbows, knees, hips, laughter that sounded like the underside of ice. We slid him onto a tile we had brought without admitting we had brought it, and the hum sent a message to his bones: you are not going to die of this. It was a lie and a promise, which is what all good spells are.\n\nWe took him back to the Retort and resented the way the air forgot it had been cruel ten minutes ago. We stripped him without dignity because dignity is a summer sport. We wrapped him in the coat because coats exist for boys more than for witches. We fed him sugar that has never once saved anyone and saves everyone. He cried for his mother and then didn\u2019t because Etta came and scolded him for drips on her floor and then kissed his ear. The Pastor knelt in the corner and did not make it about God. Rook adjusted the fox\u2019s tail and I decided that if anyone tried to make him take it offstage I would place the tile in their lap and see if their legs learned respect.\n\nThe storm blew out and left behind that silvery light that makes the town look like a photograph of itself. People went home boastful and shook and I put the coat back on its hook and told it to stop preening. We slept without dreams because the body has a sense of humor and chooses rest at the absurd times and panic at parties. When I woke, the Retort had cooled enough to tick like a grandfather clock and the tiles looked like squares where an entire town had stood patiently and listened to their own versions of themselves.\n\nThe key from my mother\u2019s tin itched in my pocket like an idea that doesn\u2019t want to be caught. It had not been the lock at the Nestl\u00e9 wall. It did not belong to any door in my shop or to storage under the stairs or to the bookcase with the secret we will all pretend not to know for decades. It wanted a throat. It wanted a particular metal sound. I went to the mill\u2019s underbelly, where the old vents still pretend they are essential. The tunnels smell like iron and adolescent kisses. I put the key to a grate and it shrugged. I put it to a panel that once had a safety sermon on it and it sighed as if remembering. The fourth try was a small innocuous box over a corridor so cold my nostrils threatened to become architecture. The key fit like a pronoun that finally makes sense. Inside was not treasure because treasure would be vulgar. It was paper. It was a rolled plan with clean lines and a date from before my mother decided to have the version of me who likes to embroider feelings onto objects. It was a drawing of a flue and a retort older than any living man in this town by twenty years. It was a way to climb into the old chimney and make it eat correctly.\n\nNate took one look and said this is stupid and then another look and said let us. He has a love for old systems the way some men love horses or their first wives. He and a girl from the college who wears boots like she owns terrain and uses words like laminar with affection ran their fingers along the map like loved ones at a grave. Gideon fetched a chain that has pulled up four cars and three lies. Delia stood with her device and her pencil and told us where the air would try to cheat. We fitted the old brick to our mouth the way I fit old hems to new fabric. I kissed my mother\u2019s initials scratched in the tin on the corner of my counter because I have given up on pretending there isn\u2019t a river between me and any good decision I make.\n\nWhen we lit the old stack it coughed like a baritone woken at noon and then cleared its throat and took the breath the way you want a body to take a breath when it has been told it can relax. The draw was easy. The jars showed their data without blushing. The heat held where it should and the coat did not have to be a hero. The town came and stood and did not applaud because this was not a show; it was a day at work. Rook put his ear to the brick and declared the chimney was telling jokes about how it had not expected to be useful again and that it would not be satisfied until someone worked a dance into its shadow. The Pastor took off his hat in the wind and did not chase it and the hat hit the brick and stopped and he looked at me as if the wall had done him a favor.\n\nMorrison came because he has good instincts for victory he can photograph himself near. He put a hand on the old brick and the brick did not warm for him because it is old enough to know the difference between affection and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He asked about scale, which is always their question, and I told him to ask me about pace instead. He offered money again and Eloise took his card again and then brought it to my shop and stuck it under a wobbly leg without smiling. Delia wrote an email with numbers as polite as she gets. The firefighters came to see if they could be spared eyebrow trauma, and I gave them cuffs and Rook told them the fox is not designed to ride in a truck and they pretended to be offended.\n\nWe laid the first run of tile along the river on a day the wind couldn\u2019t make up its mind. It was a patch, not a road, the opposite of a ribbon cutting because only babies and fools cut ribbons that are doing their best to hold something together. Children stepped and shouted and did the thing where they take four hops and then need to tell a story about a bird. Women carrying groceries stood for one extra minute and then another and the bags left their red-purple bites in their fingers and they did not mind. Gideon put a square in his boat with the seriousness he usually reserves for his hat. Etta brought bread and put it straight on the tile for warmth and committed five sins I will never scold her for. Aunt Sable chalked a word on the edge where the next square will go and she did not let me see it until the chalk had failed to brush off with a sleeve.\n\nThat night the mirror did not wait for me to stand in front of it. It brightened the way mirrors do when a woman finally lights a candle instead of pretending the dark is not dark. She stood with me and we did not say our names because we both know them and that is not what naming is for. \u201cYou stitched the river to the floor,\u201d she observed, generous in the way that makes me wonder what we will do next that will require forgiveness. \u201cYou made a chimney behave without shame. You kept a boy from dying and you forced a plant to admit it does not need a fence to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had help,\u201d I said, and it was not false modesty. I have never in my life done anything of value that didn\u2019t run through other hands like light through a window.\n\n\u201cKeep liking that part,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep asking for rope. Keep making little mouths that don\u2019t scare the city. Do not get good at spectacle. It eats you.\u201d\n\nI wrote a word on the mirror with the fat of my thumb. Keep, I wrote, and the glass fogged and cleared and kept it. I wrote a second word under it because I am greedy and because there is no other point to being a woman who can convince heat to behave. Breathe, I wrote, and the mirror did. We went to bed not early and not late and the coat hung and did not whisper. The Retort cooled with the smug contentment of a thing that has been asked to do a job it was built for. The river moved like a thought I would remember in the morning. The wind bit my eaves and was forgiven.\n\nIn the middle of the night my phone hummed with the politeness of a man who has learned how to wake you without making you hate him. It was Gideon, and he was not at the river and he was not apologizing. \u201cThe car,\u201d he said in a voice that had placed itself on the map and chosen not to move. \u201cAnother. Not old. Not ours. Out by the bend near the flats. I can get it if you want to know who decided to let go. I can leave it if you want to sleep.\u201d\n\nI pulled the quilt up to my chin and let myself lie, because I am learning to leave some things to other people who are good at grief. \u201cGet it,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me in the morning whether the river wants to punish or forgive. Tell me if the key fits another box. Tell me if I need to get out of bed.\u201d\n\nHe made a sound that men make when they are grateful women did not ask their night to be bent. \u201cSleep,\u201d he said. \u201cDream of floors.\u201d\n\nI did not dream of floors. I dreamed of hats, ridiculous hats, the kind made out of plastic snow that men wear to stay human in a storm. I dreamed of making them into tiles and then into a roof and then into a deck and then throwing the deck a party and not inviting the men. I dreamed of Morrison learning to hold a wrench and of Delia teaching a class called The Physics of Being Reasonable. I dreamed of Aunt Sable in a dress of anchors and nails. I dreamed of Rook building a creature with no tail at all that ran on insults turned into power. I dreamed of Pastor Lennox standing on a tile and saying the word floor without anyone in his congregation thinking it was a code for witch. I dreamed of my mother writing another note and tucking it under a tile at the river, and I dreamed of letting it stay.\n\nIn the morning, the air had that feel of a town that has been behaving itself and would like a treat. I made toast and didn\u2019t judge it for not being better. The tile at my feet hummed with the satisfaction of a tool that had gotten the joke. The coat watched me butter my bread with the suspicion of a garment that fears butter and the long slow creep of everyday. We would get the day anyway. We would get Morrison and the men with triangles turned into squares and the paperwork and the part where people ask if the Jar Lava is safe in a voice that cones the word witch into a new field. We would get a boy coming in with a bag full of bottle caps he had washed with care because he had learned care remains even when you have a mouth for heat. We would get a woman asking if a tile could sit on the sill of her father\u2019s room where he coughs and we would say yes and mean it. We would get Gideon\u2019s call and it would be bad and not unusual. We would get all of it. And the river, rude and spare and patient, would go on making its case for not being anyone\u2019s metaphor. It would let us stand on its breath. It would keep our breath trapped in squares on floors we had the nerve to call beautiful. It would be winter for a while yet, and then it would not be, and we would keep, and we would breathe.",

Clear to clear, brown to brown, green into the green crate I\u2019d painted with a hand-lettered REUSE, the you curling like a fishhook. In Fulton, glass still has a decent chance of being reborn into something that won\u2019t break under winter\u2019s shoulder. Plastics\u2014I hate plastics\u2014went into their purgatory bin, labels peeled and caps saved for the boy down on Thirteenth who collects them for his art. Metal, paper, cardboard cut down to neat rectangles stacked under the sink like stale wedding cake. I order things. It\u2019s what I do. Bring the frayed back to the hem. Persuade the cycles to keep turning.\n\nMy name is June Weaver. My mother says it was a lazy prophecy, naming a witch Weaver, but she was the sort who would drop a fortune on cunning and pick up foresight at a discount, so I forgive her. I make my living doing small repairs and larger ones, with needle and soldering iron, with nettle tea and murmured words, with alleyway whispers and the soft rasp of a file on a jagged edge. There\u2019s a sign over my storefront on Oneida Street that reads Stitch & Solder, and most nights it twitches in the lake wind like a bird trying to settle in a questionable tree. If you come in with a broken heirloom locket, I can make it speak. If you bring me a toaster with a ghost in it, I\u2019ll coax the specter out and into a crystal from the riverbed, where its haunting can be admired without burning your bread. I keep needles threaded in blood-red and dull gold, and a jar of greying parsley by the window for luck. I have a particular set of skills: to find what\u2019s been misplaced, to bind what\u2019s fallen apart, to coax electricity to behave like a good dog, to hear the creek under the tar of a road and call it by its old name until it answers.\n\nOutside, on the long spinal street of Fulton, the bins were lined up like a makeshift parade\u2014blue, green, open-topped with their indifferent newspapers and bottle necks. The city would swing by in the morning. The bins are not the real work; the real work is in the habit, the choice, the tiny decision repeated until it becomes a story you live inside. I rinsed my bottles and set them down easy. A habit is a spell with a longer fuse.\n\nI slept badly that night, full of the hum of machines left too long in my shop and the churn of river ice. Sometime around two or three, there was a sound. A crackle\u2014paper. A movement\u2014plastic bags talking to themselves. I have no cat. I got up. My building does this thing in winter where it keeps one foot in summer. Heat rises and doesn\u2019t settle, like bad gossip. In the kitchen my breath didn\u2019t bloom. The window over the sink was dark with river and the streetlamp across the way smeared with a fog that had been kind enough not to be a storm.\n\nUnder the light in my kitchen, a ribbon of smoke threaded like ink. Not fire-smoke, exactly. More like the artificial sweet of heated plastic, like the inside of a toy caught in a radiator. Scan the brain: stove off, kettle cool, iron unplugged. The bins. I went barefoot, toes cracking against the cold linoleum, and down the hallway, my nightgown a puddle of dark. I took the key from the hook where I keep the key and opened the back door and stepped into the star\u2019s breath.\n\nThe bins were tipped, the contents of my careful evening tossed like entrails. A mountain of newspaper slurry collapsed into the slick on the alley. The plastic bin had been folded cruelly, and there was a scorch mark on the rim that would not come out in the morning. The lids lay like petrified hats. Someone had scrawled with black marker on my green crate: who are you saving. No question mark. There were three cigarette butts ground into the wet cardboard as if they were answering.\n\nI am not quick to anger. That\u2019s not virtue. That\u2019s practice. There are protections in my house that are not dramatic. Salt at the thresholds, iron under the rugs, a mirror turned face-down under the bed to catch nightmares like flies. I squatted in the silk pajamas my aunt Sable had sent me from New Orleans and touched the scorch mark with my fingertips. My skin prickled. The shape was not random; it was a sigil, clumsy, the kind you get when someone copies a drawing without believing in it. A triangle with a broken line through the base. I know the opacity of a triangle. This one leaked. My lips remembered the taste of black smoke, and I swallowed admiration with the cold in my throat.\n\n\u201cKeep your rituals to your church, June?\u201d The voice came from the alley\u2019s mouth, and it was a familiar ache. Eloise Tan, city councilwoman and veteran of fights you don\u2019t know are fights until you have lost them. She had on a parka I recognized, the one with the mended cuff I\u2019d done for her last winter that had survived a campaign and a freeze. Her hair was veiled in a hood trimmed in what looked like the fur of a white fox that had never seen blood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my kitchen,\u201d I said, soft to not wake the neighbors. \u201cAnyway my church is the river.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery pagan,\u201d she said. She stepped into the alley like a detective in a TV show I used to watch with my mother, one of those where the moral is always: the city is a beast, but if you ride it right it can be a horse. She crouched next to me, sniffed like she didn\u2019t trust me to be honest about the chemical recipe in the air. \u201cIt\u2019s not just you. Grahams down the block, Conklin\u2019s pizza\u2014Etta said she found her compost slashed.\u201d\n\nEtta runs the co-op with a ferocity that makes you happy she uses it to feed people. Etta could fling a tomato like a grenade and you\u2019d consent to be blown up.\n\n\u201cKids?\u201d I offered, though it didn\u2019t feel like kids. I\u2019ve been a kid; I know the shape of kid acts. There is a pattern then, even in chaos, and the pattern tends toward the myth of yourself you\u2019re trying to coax from the world.\n\n\u201cKids don\u2019t leave runes,\u201d Eloise said, pointing with a gloved finger at the triangle. \u201cThat\u2019s cult nonsense.\u201d\n\nWitch, cult, church. We keep repackaging the same boxes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it,\u201d I said, and I meant the mark, the mess, the thing that had made both.\n\nEloise sighed. \u201cI keep fighting to keep the glass program, June. If people see this, they\u2019ll say, cut it. They\u2019ll say, you\u2019re feeding a thing that doesn\u2019t want to be fed. The city is tired. The budget is the vampire we sleep with.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be the one who worries about monsters,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d she said, and gave me a look like a blessing. \u201cAnd June?\u201d\n\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe lock your bins.\u201d\n\n\u201cNext I\u2019ll put a gate on the river,\u201d I said. Eloise huffed a laugh that sifted into the fog and went about her business of saving what could be saved with policy and indomitable hair.\n\nI cleaned the alley in a nightgown and the stubbornness of a woman who doesn\u2019t like being messed with. As I sorted, the smoke smell faded, as if embarrassed. I took the marker and wrote under the who are you saving: you. Myself. The gulls. All of us. A little petty, perhaps, but sometimes a witch writing an answer is a hex. Sometimes the hex is a way to feel less small.\n\nMorning in Fulton is a blue that doesn\u2019t belong to any sky more than to water. The river collects color like stories and then tells them back. The city woke. Buses snarled. A man in a tan coat that had been tan twenty years ago yelled into a phone about unions. A baby in a stroller looked at me like I was both safer and more dangerous than her mother would allow. I opened my shop as the clock over the library chimed nine, the sound too church for my taste but nice in winter when your bones look for a reason to stand. Stitch & Solder smells like wool and something like cinnamon but isn\u2019t. I flipped the sign to open and the bell chimed like a coin dropping into a well.\n\nAunt Sable called as I was untangling the bracelets from the dollhouse chandelier that had been brought in by a woman who wanted to use it as a lamp for her cat\u2019s birthday party. \u201cJune-bug,\u201d she sang. \u201cThe river told me to call you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe river has my number,\u201d I said. \u201cRoutine complaint or emergency?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tease your old aunt. This is serious. There\u2019s a shadow around your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cA signature? Or a literal atmospheric anomaly?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get clever. It\u2019s the kind of shadow that burns in photographs. I can see the singe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d I said, and I told her about the bins. Why does telling a person who loves you always make things worse? Because then it becomes haunted twice. Once by the thing. Once by their fear.\n\nSable hissed\u2014a sound like steam, like the river when it breaks free from a culvert. \u201cChild. You staying in? You grounding?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy feet are on the floor, Auntie.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let your clever mouth run ahead of you. There\u2019s a witch in the county who\u2019s been burning. I\u2019ve felt it in the mails. They don\u2019t recycle. They aren\u2019t reusing anything. Using. Used. Do you understand me?\u201d She got sharp when the world got messy. She had spent her youth cleaning up messes made by men with more money than magic. Now she sits on her porch and reads the weather for people who never say please.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t recycle,\u201d I repeated, and felt something like laughter and nausea. \u201cHow do you not recycle?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou throw everything away,\u201d she said darkly. \u201cEven if it\u2019s yourself.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the morning was work. A silver whistle with a cracked reed. A quilt mended from five generations of shirts. A radio with a voice that belonged to a woman whose husband had died on a Tuesday and never found the body; the woman\u2019s voice had gotten stuck in the weather band, announcing rain when it was sunny, whispering the humidity like a secret. I set the radio on the counter and hummed to it and put my palm on its back as if it had a fever. It was a two-hour negotiation, and in the end the woman left the radio lighter and I sent the hitchhiking voice into a blue marble. The marble rolled to the wall and now holds an invisible weather system. I like to think her husband knows where he is, even if he doesn\u2019t.\n\nAt noon Etta burst in. \u201cYou heard?\u201d she said, not waiting for my no. \u201cThe t-shirt printer on Second? Their bins were set on fire. Actual fire. They had to call the men in hats, and now the hats want to know if it\u2019s us.\u201d\n\n\u201cUs?\u201d I said, though I knew who she meant and she knew I knew she knew.\n\n\u201cWitches. He used the \u2018w\u2019 word. In a way that says he\u2019s watched a lot of YouTube.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of explaining to people that the witchy things they hate are the things you do in your kitchen when you sing to the bread and swear at the roast because it burned but then you cut off the black and say it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cPreaching to the choir,\u201d Etta snapped. She set a brown paper bag on my counter with a thump. \u201cHere. Lunch. Don\u2019t you argue.\u201d\n\nIt was chili that smelled like it had made peace with onions. I warmed it on the hot plate with a grudge and ate it leaning against the counter because if I sat down I would stay down and the day would roll me like a log.\n\nThe rumor swelled. The internet managed to tangle itself into knots of moral clarity and conspiracy like a cat in long curtains. I ignored it on purpose for an hour. Then two. The third hour the fog stepped inside my shop like an uninvited relative and sat down on my stool. The bell over my door chimed again and there was a man whose soft wool hat was damp all the way through. He had eyes that knew the river in a way I didn\u2019t, which is saying something. I know it by smell\u2014mineral and fish, copper pennies and the underskirt of algae. He knew it by the way a current draws a body and how long things float.\n\n\u201cJune,\u201d he said, and did not offer a hand as if this was not that kind of visit. \u201cYou better come.\u201d\n\n\u201cGideon,\u201d I said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not my ancestor I don\u2019t know who is.\u201d Gideon runs the fire boat. He fishes the ones the river takes when it decides. He finds cars that have thought being water would be gentler than being road. He wears his grief like a coat he washed in cold water and then ironed because that\u2019s what you do with sorrow; you make it presentable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gull,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also a message.\u201d\n\nI locked the shop with a chalk line like a smile over the door. Gideon and I walked the slope toward the river that made the town and in exchange asked that we handle vigilance like devotion. The river in winter is a lozenge. Bitter, medicinal. It sits. It waits. On the tattered ice near the old Nestl\u00e9 plant\u2014dead and done with sweetness decades ago\u2014lay a gull. The gull was dead in a way that suggested it had been dead for some time, and also in a way that suggested it had been set where it was. Someone had wanted it found. Its belly was split. It was full of plastic. You hear about this. You don\u2019t see it. I didn\u2019t want to. Bottle caps like candy, a lighter, a comb, a tiny child\u2019s barrette shaped like a bow that I recognized because I had sold three of them to a woman who had said they were for her niece\u2019s dolls. Its eyes were soft and its beak was rung with a black ring of ash.\n\nOn the ice beside the bird was the same sigil as on my bin.\n\n\u201cCould be kids,\u201d Gideon said, in the tone of a man who knows it could be worse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201d He tucked his hands into his coat and watched the sky with a sensitivity animals know. \u201cThere\u2019s talk about a witch. The city is full of talk. She doesn\u2019t recycle.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t recycle,\u201d I repeated, but the words came out with a different weight the second time. A person who takes what works from the world and doesn\u2019t return the favor. A person who floods the cycle with noise.\n\n\u201cYou going to find her?\u201d Gideon asked softly.\n\n\u201cI have a particular set of skills,\u201d I said, and the sentence sounded like a joke only to people who had not seen me unsnap a curse from a doorknob or coax a laugh out of a grieving coffee cup that had belonged to someone\u2019s father too long.\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u201d he said, but his voice said: be careful of yourself.\n\nThe rumor had a shape now. A triangle with a broken base. A burner. The Black Bag Witch. The one who says: throw it in the trash, who says: it doesn\u2019t matter, who says: sort your hopes, if you like, but please let me have this flame.\n\nI started at the transfer station. I picked up cans with a stick and tipped over boxes that smelled like a garden that had lost its name. Nate who runs the place knows me by my temper. \u201cJune,\u201d he said with a grin like a railroad crossing. \u201cForget your gloves again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to feel what I\u2019m feeling,\u201d I said, and he snorted. He set me up with a vest the color of taxicabs and a pair of gloves that made my fingers feel like they were trying to read in mittens.\n\nI walked the lines. Left a thread of myself behind like a spinning spider. I call it thread-sense, not because I\u2019m pretty about it but because words matter. I can track a person by the way they handle a jar. The way they fold paper. The way they crumple. The way their energy sits in the discard. On the third day and the fifth hour and the eighth pile of mis-sorted plastic, I found a whorl of something that made my mouth taste like pennies. Hot, careless. The sigil again, drawn on a takeout lid with the grease from meat not from this county. Something of mine caught in the grease\u2014hair? No. The echo of a flavor I had eaten once and said, never again.\n\nI followed the thread out of the station and into the brownfield behind the old Hannibal mill where the grass grows tempted then bitter. You know an abandoned place by the way it remembers us without flattery. The fence had been cut by hands that knew how to cut fences with a cutter bought at a store where the clerk had looked away on purpose. Inside what might have been a warehouse or a school gym once a long time ago, a space spread out like a mouth remembering how to laugh. The floor was silt and bird droppings and broken bottles half-sunk like teeth. Someone had drawn the sigil on the chalky wall over and over, nervous scribbles that got cleaner as they went. And there was my jar of greying parsley, the one from my window, and I had not put it there.\n\nSable says the problem with old mills is they are hungry. They gorge on labor for decades and then when you stop feeding them they bite your hand. The mill\u2019s hunger looked like a drift of plastic bags collected in a corner and humming a little in that way that only people like me hear. I could taste the burn on the back of my tongue. There were cigarette butts in a cracked sink; lipstick stains on the paper of a cheap cup. A black bag ripped. I crouched by the parsley\u2014which had been emptied onto the floor in a shock of grey leaves like hair\u2014and touched the jar\u2019s lip. My fingerprints there, old. My print on a print. A mirror of me was here or had been here or had used my things.\n\nI left the mill like a thief. The thread-sense went with me, stitched through my coat, bound to my ribs. I slept that night like I\u2019d been set on a slow river that sometimes goes under and becomes a different river entirely.\n\nFulton is kind to stalls that sell hot sugar on sticks and fresh donuts the size of small boats. If you want a mark, you do it on a day when the whole town smells like something from an old calendar. The Green Days fair down by the lock is supposed to be merry. There are tables with pamphlets so earnest they wear a blush. There is a man with a beard so monumental it might be a monument to beards, and he has a machine that turns old t-shirts into yarn and the yarn into hats and the hats into compliments for babies. There are students with bright eyes who say: compost numbers! And there is one of those bikes you pedal to make a blender spin, and the children get to be blenders. Etta had a booth that could have been a barricade. Gideon had photographs of the river that were so beautiful you wanted to die and be water.\n\nI had a table with a bowl of single earrings that I\u2019d coaxed into pairs. A pot of herbs for exchange. A sign that read Free Mendings. A little line formed and stayed like weather. I sewed a button back on a coat. I unpicked the hem of a memory and pressed it open with spit and thumbs and a charm for flattening the past enough to step on. I smiled until my lips felt like local celebrities.\n\nAt one, the wind changed. These are the things you notice when your blood knows the angle of the light. It shifted from south to east, bringing with it the genius of a factory that no longer exists. People went closed, like clams. The smell sharpened. And then the bins by the municipal table\u2014overflowing with the good intention of a thousand sample cups\u2014flared. A flame like a tongue licked up, rolled, doubled itself like a jellyfish and kept going. There was a scatter and a shout. Someone threw a bucket at the fire, which is not a sentence so much as a confession. Water pleased the plastic for a second and then made it furious.\n\n\u201cExtinguisher!\u201d Etta roared, and someone obeyed her who had never before obeyed a woman. The extinguisher coughed and the white smother fell and the fire made its thin cry and settled into a smear of shame.\n\nOn the white, in the outline, the sigil. This would have been a time to run for the person doing it. This would have been a time to say: witch-hunt, in a tone that meant, we already know how this goes. Instead I stood still, held in place by a tug somewhere in the meat of my shoulder. My shoulder aches when a hurricane is thinking about my town. It also aches when I have done something I don\u2019t want to admit to myself yet.\n\n\u201cJune.\u201d Eloise\u2019s voice had the tremor in it reserved for conversations about budgets and the deaths of good ideas. \u201cWe cannot afford this.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgreed,\u201d I said. The wind made a half-hearted attempt at playing with my hair and gave up. I tasted sugar. Melted plastic. The ghost of a carnival. I tugged my thread-sense and it snapped tight as if something had taken hold of the line and was playing. A pull; I staggered like a fish. An answer to a question I had asked in no language anyone taught me. It pulled north, toward the old Nestl\u00e9, toward the river\u2019s one man-made apostasy.\n\nI excused myself the way you excuse yourself from your own party when you remember there is a pan in the oven that was never in the oven to begin with. My feet were sure. Why not? They knew where I have gone in the night I\u2019m not allowed to own yet.\n\nThe factory is a carcass. Everyone says that. They say it as if the V of broken windows can\u2019t bite still. The smell of milk is gone, but in summer if you stand in the right place, sweet ghost. I walked past the No Trespassing sign with the humility of someone who obeys signs but not this one. Inside, in the place where chocolate used to be poured like prayer, someone had spelled out words with plastic cutlery. We don\u2019t recycle, they had written, which was both a statement and a threat. A heap of black bags sat like a dragon hid its wealth and went cheap.\n\nI should have called someone. That is the thing that reasonable women who are tired of mopping up after unreasonable things do. Call Gideon or Eloise or Nate or even the man with the mountain of beard and the yarn machine. Instead I put my hand on the nearest bag and felt heat. Not heat from flame. Heat from hands. Hands that had been mine, at least recently. Again the penny taste. Again the thread pulling. I took a breath and tugged. The world turned.\n\nWhen I woke up, the light was the white-out of afternoons that have decided to be evenings against advice. My hands were gritty. Under my nails: grey. Ash. My pockets slick with something sweet. A smear of black on my jaw that smelled like a lollipop had had a bad idea. The heap of bags had been rearranged while I was asleep or while I was someone else. The cutlery words had been scrambled to an arrangement that made less sense but spoke to me anyway. Ecycle. Leryc. Cry. I wiped my mouth and tasted sugar and something burned. I had lost an hour or a day. Time is a substance too; you can deprive yourself of it, and then it discovers ways to deprive you in return.\n\nOn the floor someone had drawn the sigil once more. And beside it, the mark I put on things I have made so that I can find them by feel in the dark. I have put that mark on a hundred mends, tucked into seams like a whisper. I have never drawn it where anyone can see. My stomach dropped. My mark and the triangle sharing a wall like neighbors who have started to borrow sugar and then borrow other things and then one day they borrow the other\u2019s name and no one can tell whose it was to begin with.\n\nI wandered home with my coat open and my mind shut. The night was hungry and my house was both a shelter and a witness. I scrubbed the smear off my face and it came off too easily. I put the parsley jar back without speaking to it. I opened the drawer where I keep the good salts and I put a line around my bed so thick it might have stopped a river, and then I stepped over it like I was a teenager and the salt was a rule. Sleep came. Sleep went. There were dreams, but they were like rooms without switches.\n\nThe next day I ate toast at Etta\u2019s because if I made my own I would teach the bread something I did not want it to know about me. I listened as people spoke in the same tone about the weather and the economy and the witch as if all three were connected and also none of them could be solved. Pastor Lennox came in and didn\u2019t order anything and Etta gave him coffee anyway because she is more gracious than he deserves and because grace is cheaper flavoured when the person receiving it needs it. He looked at me like I was a problem he had not yet invented a sermon for. He touched his tie pin with a rhythm people who do not pray cannot hear.\n\n\u201cYou going to the council meeting?\u201d Eloise asked, sliding into the booth like she was an extra person in my life preserver. \u201cThey want to vote on cutting glass, June. They say the fire makes it look bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand up. I\u2019ll speak,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll mend.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she said, and then, almost not letting herself, \u201cBe careful.\u201d She meant: be careful not to make it worse.\n\nAt the meeting there was shouting. There are two kinds of shouting: the kind that gets things moving, and the kind that lights a match. We had both. Men who had never sorted a bag of anything in their lives said words like personal responsibility. Women who have sorted their families for decades said words like community and tired. My mouth tasted like sheet cake and shame. Eloise held the line. Gideon spoke once only, and the room got quiet. He said: I pull the river\u2019s dead out, do not make me pull out your hope. It was melodrama and it worked because it was true.\n\nThen a woman stood up with a flyer. It was a flyer I had made last spring, for a repair night at my shop. I recognize my own italics. The sigil had been sketched in in pencil, like a mustache on a portrait. Underneath, the writing: save your scraps for the witch. My handwriting. My pen. The same curl on my y\u2019s that Aunt Sable teases me about. I stood. Sat. A weird low note was stuck in my chest and it didn\u2019t belong to a song.\n\n\u201cJune?\u201d Eloise said under her breath, grim as tax. \u201cIs that\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cA copy,\u201d I said. \u201cA prank.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have to be a good one,\u201d she said. She meant: the people who hate you are not usually this clever.\n\nI went home walking on the spine of the night as if I were afraid of the edges. The alley was clean only because I had cleaned it. I set my bins inside my door like I was the kind of person who feeds a raccoon out of fear. In my mirror a girl with my hair looked out with eyes I didn\u2019t recognize and then she blinked and was me again. I threw a bottle at the trash can and missed. It rolled under the table and came to rest against a little nest of dust I had not decided if I loved or not. Sometimes human detritus is the only proof of animals.\n\nThere are so many stories about witches and their mirrors. How we fear them. How we live in them. How a mirror is just a river made obedient. I went to the river at midnight and held my breath until the stars looked like holes poked in black paper. A voice said, I won\u2019t recycle, and it was my voice, but I didn\u2019t say it. I said back, that\u2019s not what we do. The river said, do you know what you do? I have always admired water\u2019s rudeness.\n\nThe next morning the bins on Oneida were righted and resigned. The city had not yet noticed the scare. There were new marks on the brick by my door. The triangle, yes. And a phrase that made the edges of my vision pixellate just a little. we are the same\u2014 Someone had stopped before the last word, or maybe they had decided to let the wall keep it. The chalk was the same chalk I use to mark hems. The handwriting was mine, and it had been done either while I was asleep or while I had been someone else. There was a piece of black plastic tucked into my mailbox like a love letter, curled to a stiffness that made me think of bones. I took it inside and put it on the counter and just looked at it for a while until the looking became a ritual and that made it safer.\n\nI asked the river a question that afternoon with a net of copper wire and three dead batteries. The question was: what part of me is eating the rest? The river answered with a fish that had been born wrong, all eyes and no depth. It thrashed in my hands and I said sorry and I said it too late because that is how sorry works, and I let it go back to a thing that has no opinion about me.\n\nA day later, a woman with a late sunburn came into Stitch & Solder with an electric kettle and a look that said she had been up all night considering moral math. \u201cIt\u2019s broken,\u201d she told me, and then, compulsive, the confession: \u201cI burned my plastic bin. It was full and I was tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to fix your kettle or your certainty,\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThey say there\u2019s a witch,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say she doesn\u2019t recycle. That must seem small to you, what with all the other things. But I feel it. The wrongness.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall things make systems. Systems make worlds,\u201d I said. I opened the kettle. A triangle had been scratched inside, amateur, angry. The kettle\u2019s heating element was clogged with a melt that must have screamed when it died. \u201cDid you do this?\u201d\n\nShe blushed, then hardened. \u201cHe said it would make it faster. He said we were just sending it somewhere else anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy boyfriend,\u201d she said, and the past tense gathered at the edges like a storm hoping to become history. \u201cHe said he knew a witch who was fixing the city. He said people like me\u2014well. You know what people tend to say about people like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo on and finish,\u201d I said gently.\n\n\u201cPoor. Busy. Stupid. He said she made fire that ate things we can\u2019t see.\u201d\n\nI set the kettle down. The river was in my ears, a low insistence. \u201cDo you know her name?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. They just called her\u2014\u201d She squinted in the direction of memory. \u201cCrackle.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve had many names. June, mostly, said by people who want me to stay. Bug, by Aunt Sable when she thinks she\u2019s my mother. Witch, by people who think they\u2019re hurting me when they\u2019re not. A girl once called me Stitch, soft. No one has ever called me Crackle. The name sat weird in my mouth, on my tongue like a seed I didn\u2019t want but swallowed anyway.\n\nI took the kettle into my lap and did the mending with my best needle. When I was done, I kept the triangle for myself. It fit over my mark with a symmetry I didn\u2019t want.\n\nThat night I waited for the other me like a date. I set the bins out with their lids latched like only a person who has had a raccoon in her flour knows how to latch. I brewed tea and I salted the doorway and I put the mirror under the bed upside down and I left my shoes pointed toward the river and I wore a hat. I don\u2019t know why I wore a hat. I paced. Around two or three\u2014same time, same slide\u2014the smell came. Sweet and wrong. The window carry of the alley\u2019s whispers. I stood in the doorway and I saw her.\n\nShe was my height. She was my hair but wrong by a degree, like a song played at a slightly different speed. She wore a coat I used to own, the green one with a patch on the elbow that looks like a leaf, and she had my shoulders like a promise. She tipped my bin and made a sigh like relief. She held the cigarette like a protest and then she thought better of it and put it out on the rim. She drew the triangle with the butt. It smeared. I stepped out, silent as a cat that hasn\u2019t decided if it loves you. She turned her head. I saw my face and didn\u2019t. The angle was different. The eyes\u2014no. They were mine. She knew my fear well enough to cross the street in front of it.\n\n\u201cWho are you saving,\u201d she said, my voice and not my voice, without the question mark, and then she ran. Or I ran. Or we both did in opposite directions, which maybe was the same direction.\n\nI chased. Of course I chased. I am not the kind of woman who watches her own back and does not try to tap it. Down Oneida, over the rumor of black ice, through a lot behind a bar with a sign in the window that said, quietly, be kind. Past the library that holds all our ghosts in a neat grid. Into the mill\u2019s shadow. Into the river\u2019s mouth. I lost her at the place where the Nestl\u00e9 stack throws a line across the ground even at night you can be burned by old light. She vanished like she knew how. And then I felt it\u2014the tug on the thread I had woven into myself when I touched that grease at the transfer station. It pulled and I pulled back and for a second I felt my own hand in mine and it scared me so much I let go.\n\nWhen I went back to my alley, the bins were not my bins. They were black bags. They were broken lids. They were the shape of a story I was still writing and couldn\u2019t yet read. I drew a circle on my kitchen table with salt and put my palms flat and said the names of the people I love. Aunt Sable in her swamp of a porch. Eloise in her iron spectrum. Etta with her tomatoes and her uncompromising butter. Gideon in his boat. The baby who looked at me in her stroller. The gull, even the gull. And I said my own name and watched it flicker as if it were a candle I had set too near a vent.\n\n\u201cJune-bug?\u201d Aunt Sable said when I called her at a time that would have been rude if she were not a woman who sits up and argues with the moon. \u201cSweet. Tell me it. The thing you can\u2019t say.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d I said, and in the space after think all the possible lonelies gathered and held their breath, \u201cI think I am the witch who doesn\u2019t recycle.\u201d\n\nHer silence was a floor I lay down on. Then: \u201cYou don\u2019t do that, child. That\u2019s not your make.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what I do,\u201d I whispered, the kind of whisper that probably woke the next apartment. \u201cI put it in the right bins. I rinse. I sort. I banned plastic bags from my shop. I can\u2019t stand the sound a bottle makes when it breaks wrong. But there are nights, Auntie. There are nights when the burn\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cI know about the burn,\u201d she said softly, like a confession she had been waiting to say. \u201cYour mother\u2014well. And me. Me too.\u201d There was the sound of birds outside her window. Birds that eat time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to put things back,\u201d I said. \u201cNot to throw away the recyclable parts of ourselves. Not to light them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always loved a rule,\u201d she said. \u201cBut humans make rules because we don\u2019t trust the river not to do what it will.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have my mark next to her mark,\u201d I told her. \u201cIn a place. In places. People are saying Crackle and I think that\u2019s mine, too. How can that be mine?\u201d\n\nSable made a sound like she was taking a pin out of her mouth. \u201cJune, every witch is two. Some are three. Some are a village. We are creatures of cycles and also of chasms. Maybe you made something to hold your scorch.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d I said, bleak as iced-over mud.\n\nShe sighed, a heartbreak. \u201cThat is not the same as not having it.\u201d\n\nWhen I set the phone down, the salt circle had melted into a map of my kitchen I did not recognize. Outside, the bins waited for morning. The river turned over in its sleep. I stood in my doorway and listened to the city be everything it is: small and mean, kind and indelible, damp. I turned out my light and slept in my coat because I did not want to be caught naked by my other self when she came to do what I do not want to do and yet I will do if I can\u2019t bear not to.\n\nIn the dream the gull spoke in a voice that could have been the radio lady\u2019s or Gideon\u2019s or Aunt Sable\u2019s if you\u2019ve swallowed grief long enough. It said: recycle, recycle, the word became meaningless as all useful words do when they are said without an object to love. The gull opened its beak and out fell a river bead, blue and cold. I picked it up and knew it. I had put it in a jar months ago because it was pretty and forgot it. In the dream and then in my waking hand, it was the same marble that held the weather. The marble swirled. Rain, then lightning. A circle closing. A line breaking. I dropped it and it didn\u2019t roll far\u2014it found the seam in the floorboards where things vanish and go to be a secret.\n\nI do not have an answer, not at the close of this, not with the bins waiting, not with the city\u2019s vote delayed, not with Eloise\u2019s eyes asking what kind of ally I am if I am the problem, not with Etta\u2019s hands red from washing more cups than any person should wash, not with Gideon\u2019s boat, patient. I have a set of skills. I can find things that want to be found. I can bind. I can stitch the shape of a person back to the shape they think they are. I can solder cheap circuit boards until they confess their longing to be music. I cannot yet keep the other me from striking a match and smiling at the way it sounds. I can\u2019t say she is not me. I can say this: if I find her, I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m going to save her or stop her or both. It will involve a mirror. It will involve the river. It will involve winter and glass and the smell of sugar singing wrong.\n\nFor now I rinse the jar. I sort the lids. I take the chalk from the wall and rub the words until they are dust in my palm. I do not blow the dust away. I put it in a bottle. I label it. I write: evidence of a choice you have not yet made. I put it on the shelf next to the marble that holds a storm. I sleep with the sound of bags as they whisper to each other in the night. I put my shoes by the door as if that is something like a spell. I wait. I wait like the river waits. I guess that is the only spell any of us ever learned that works.",

I pushed my bins back out because I refuse to be the kind of person who lets fear make her trash king. The lids clicked in that way that satisfies a part of the brain that believes it can keep everything from spilling if it puts enough force on plastic. The street was salt-scabbed. Tires made that noise of surrender that tires make when they finally find grit. I watched a man in a neon vest try and fail to fold a tarp over a stack of newspaper from last month, and I thought about time: how it stacks, how we try to keep it dry, how it always manages to pucker and spot.\n\nThe boy from Thirteenth shuffled past with his backpack ballooning with impossible angles. He has the kind of walk you learn when nothing you own wants to fit where it should. I keep his name in my mouth and never say it because he doesn\u2019t offer it and I\u2019m old-fashioned that way. He accepted the bag of caps I\u2019d been saving like the day had been waiting for him to arrive and rescue it. He put his hand in and sifted around until the clack changed into a note with tone. \u201cThey\u2019re making harder plastic now,\u201d he said, like a meteorologist who has stopped being surprised by storms. \u201cIt warps nastier. It goes all ugly.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of it was born ugly,\u201d I said, unable to help it. \u201cSome of it was born useful, then forgot.\u201d\n\nHe pulled out a fused sheet of blue, green, and bone-white, bubbled like the bottom of a cheap casserole dish that saw the broil setting one time and never forgave you. A triangle traced itself across the warps, uninvited and too clear. He turned it in his hands and squinted. \u201cHe said it was art,\u201d the boy said, meaning someone who isn\u2019t good enough to be a teacher and isn\u2019t brave enough to be an artist. \u201cHe gave it to me because it burned wrong. I tried to sand it, but it keeps the mark.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep it anyway,\u201d I said, even though my stomach wanted me to ask him to put it in my hands so I could do the stupid brave thing where you take a live wire because you respect it. \u201cYou\u2019ll know where it is if you need to break it.\u201d\n\nHe smiled sideways and tucked it into the backpack\u2019s mouth. \u201cPeople keep wanting me to make dolphins,\u201d he said, and rolled his eyes like he had just been asked to peel an orange with a backhoe. \u201cI\u2019m making a fox. It has ten tails.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I said. \u201cLet it have as many tails as it needs to chase itself and not get tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt runs on fire,\u201d he said with the satisfaction of someone who has named the fuel and isn't ashamed. He adjusted the straps and kept walking. When his back got small, the wind picked up, and a flurry of grocery bags did that thing where they pretend to be birds and then remember they have no bones.\n\nPastor Lennox showed up before I could decide whether to open or to hide. He came with a pamphlet that had not yet had the chance to be embarrassed by itself. He held it with the same fingers I\u2019ve seen on piano players. The pin in his tie was a cross the size of a thumbnail, which means you have to look, and that\u2019s the point. He looked at my sign, then at my hands, as if one of them was lying. \u201cMs. Weaver,\u201d he said in a voice that had put many babies to sleep and convinced many men they were forgiven. \u201cMay I take a moment?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d I don\u2019t do it because I\u2019m polite; I do it because if you are rude to a man like that, he will write you a starring role in a parable nobody wants to hear.\n\nHe came two steps inside and stopped like a dog that knows the edge of a rug and the edge of a territory are the same thing. He opened the pamphlet, honored its crease. There were photos of bins on fire, cropped tight so you couldn\u2019t see the hands. There were words like stewardship and words like danger, and there was a grainy capture that could have been anyone with my bones moving the world with their shoulders. \u201cWe want to help,\u201d he said, which documented a want, not a plan.\n\n\u201cDo you?\u201d I asked, because my mouth has never been obedient when a word offers itself like a bridge and turns out to be a plank.\n\nHe nodded as if nodding was an argument that required no supporting text. \u201cRepentance is a form of sorting,\u201d he said, as though he was giving me a bag with compartments. \u201cYou take what you\u2019ve done and you put it where it belongs.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you sort your recycling, Pastor?\u201d The question came out too sharp, and I wished for a second I could bend it.\n\nHis mouth tightened in the way of people who know the answer will be used as a story no matter what it is. \u201cMy wife does,\u201d he said finally, and then, quickly, like a boy trying to make you understand why he is the way he is, \u201cI help when I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that kind of help,\u201d I said, and I smiled like a person with a hammer smiles at a screw. \u201cI\u2019m working on the burning. It\u2019s not a sermon, it\u2019s a thing with elements. It might require a controlled setting. It will require patience no one has.\u201d\n\nHe looked relieved in a way that made me sad for both of us. He set the pamphlet down as if it might explode under the wrong pressure. \u201cWe have a basement,\u201d he said. \u201cIn case you ever need one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a river,\u201d I said, and he nodded, like a man who knows when he has been bested by myth.\n\nAfter he left I locked the door not because I was afraid of him but because the room had changed shape and needed to be reminded of me. I took the mirror from under the bed and put it face-up on the table, the way you set a plate for someone you hope is in a mood to eat what you\u2019re serving. I fetched the jars with their labels my mother taught me to write like penance. Basil. Parsley. Rust. Rain. I took the blue marble out and put it in a teacup because some things need a witness and some things need a cradle. I chalked my mark small in one corner and the triangle small in the other, then I drew a line between them that my hand wanted to be straight and my heart wanted to be crooked. Then I threaded a needle with hair and linen and a wire you cannot buy; you gather it from the hum refrigerators make when they think no one listens.\n\nWhen I called for her, I didn\u2019t say her name because people who know better told me not to. I said mine twice and then once more under my breath, which is how you take honesty and make it a dare. For a full minute the only movement was the slow storm inside the marble, rolling itself like dough. The mirror showed me myself until it didn\u2019t. My face softened into a text you had to squint to read, then sharpened into a person who had my mouth but wore it like a borrowed thing.\n\n\u201cI was hoping you\u2019d do this,\u201d she said, and the mirror did a trick with depth that made me want to be sick on my own floor. Her coat\u2014it was that green so specifically mine it put a heat under my tongue\u2014was buttoned with impatience. She didn\u2019t touch the glass because she didn\u2019t need to. We both know how not to smudge if the thing that would get smudged is you.\n\n\u201cI keep a shop,\u201d I said, because sometimes the only way to begin is with a sentence you know is true. \u201cI keep a system. I keep my knees warm in winter. I keep the bins where the truck can get to them. Why do you keep lighting what I keep?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause keeping isn\u2019t saving,\u201d she answered, and where I have comfort she has clarity, and that\u2019s unfair, but the body never promised to divvy up the traits justly. \u201cBecause your keeping is a purse with a hole. You patch other people\u2019s fabric with gold and blood, and then you come home with fingers that itch and your jaw tight as a trap, and you put everything of yours in the neatest boxes and none of it gets smaller. You ask the river to carry it and she\u2019s tired, June. So I vault.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making fire from restlessness,\u201d I said, because we have both had the kind of lover you can\u2019t take to meet your friends. \u201cYou\u2019re burning the wrong thing to heat a room you don\u2019t even go into.\u201d\n\nShe tilted her head in that way I\u2019ve seen in reflective windows when you think you\u2019ve caught yourself and you haven\u2019t. \u201cYou want a kiln,\u201d she said, like a midwife naming a baby you didn\u2019t think you could have. \u201cYou want to build one, and you want to feed it on purpose. Don\u2019t lie to me. You like the truth too much to avoid the violent parts of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want a boundary,\u201d I said through my teeth. \u201cI want a burn that isn\u2019t a tantrum. I want to teach the heat to sing in key.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am your fire,\u201d she said mildly, like she was telling me what size shoes I wear. \u201cI am the part of you that doesn\u2019t sort, because sorting is a way to pretend that an ending can be domesticated. You called me when you looked at the bins and felt your own smallness like a bruise you keep pressing. You asked for a quick way. Quick ways are me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not ask for a gull full of toys,\u201d I said, and the mirror went mean around the edges, which is what happens when you say something the world takes personally. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for a boy with burned plastic in his bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou asked for relief,\u201d she said, not unkind now, which made me hate her a degree less and myself another degree extra. \u201cYou outsourced the heat. If you want it back, build me a mouth. If you want me gone, drown me. But you don\u2019t get to pretend I\u2019m not you. You don\u2019t get to call me she and leave yourself clean.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d I asked, because I am so tired of metaphor even as I lace it into everything. \u201cHow do I build your mouth and not become a thing everyone will be sorry they tried to love?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou already know,\u201d she said, looking down, and I followed her eyes because they are mine. The marble spun lightning. The storm pressed its face to the glass. The river had an opinion. \u201cRepeat your work, but hotter. Stitch, but with flame. Solder, but with stricter mercy. Capture the breath. Trap the poison in a tile and make the babies walk on it without it walking into them. You want to save. Save by transformation. Save by admitting you like to change things. Stop lying that mending is gentle.\u201d She smiled, and if you have never seen your own mouth smile at you when you do not want it to, I both recommend and do not recommend it. \u201cThree days,\u201d she said, conversational as weather. \u201cOn the fourth the wind will reverse. On the fourth I will do it without you.\u201d\n\nThe mirror went back to being a river that had learned obedience reluctantly. My face returned. My hair looked like the aftermath of a summer thunderstorm. The marble settled into rain and stayed, as if it had been convinced by argument or lulled by exhaustion. I sat and fed myself the heel of yesterday\u2019s bread with the care you give wild animals and thought about words like kiln and mouth and mouth that eats fire and spits glass. A plan is a spell with drawings; I made drawings with a pencil that had been used for meat and taxes and love notes and was therefore luckier than most.\n\nThe first person I told was Nate, because if anyone in this town knows how to look at a mountain that used to be a hill and decide where to put ropes, it\u2019s the man who will climb it because he\u2019s got to get the bottles out before they shift. He stood at the edge of the glass drop and chewed gum like it was the world\u2019s fingers, then nodded in the slow rhythm of someone calculating weight. \u201cWe\u2019ve got the old pizza oven Conklin tossed when the new one came with a touchscreen and a personality,\u201d he said, eyes half-closed because the picture he was looking at wasn\u2019t in front of him. \u201cIt\u2019s ugly stainless, but it gets hot and holds it. We got ductwork nobody cries over if it smells like old pepperoni for the rest of its life. We\u2019ll need scrap iron, and we\u2019ll need to keep the witches who only read articles from showing up with signs. You promising me no plume?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m promising you capture,\u201d I said, not because I like to promise but because some men, and some ovens, only agree to show up if you use the right verb. \u201cI can net the breath. We\u2019ll bind it to ceramic. It won\u2019t like it, but it will hold.\u201d I didn\u2019t say tiles because tiles are for bathrooms and I was thinking about roads, about replacing asphalt with shame that held, about giving children hopscotch that keeps their lungs clear.\n\nWe welded. Welding is a kind of marriage if you\u2019re not careful how you talk about it. Sparks made confetti and we pretended it was a holiday. We hauled the carcass of the oven under the lean-to and bolted it to a floor that has held up more weight than any of us will ever give it credit for. I climbed inside with a brush and a mouth full of prayer and painted the interior with a slurry I made from Etta\u2019s ash, river mud, and the scraped grief off the bottom of Gideon\u2019s boat. The slurry dried to a dull grey like we had invented a new species of rock that remembered hands. Nate looked like he wanted to call someone to come make us stop, and then he remembered there wasn\u2019t anyone we trusted with that job. \u201cYou got a name?\u201d he asked, as if the right name would make the dial willing to go to ten without blowing past.\n\n\u201cRetort,\u201d I said, because Aunt Sable taught me that words are leashes and you choose the soft ones if you want something to follow you without bloodying your palms.\n\nEloise came with her clipboard and her hair pulled back so hard it changed her posture. She walked around the apparatus, tapping the metal with the butt of her pen because you don\u2019t get to chair a meeting in this town if you don\u2019t love the sound a machine makes when it pretends to be immune to your judgment. \u201cIf this fails,\u201d she said, and left the sentence there, gesturing at a future full of meetings none of us wanted to sit through because every chair in City Hall is haunted by one resigned woman and one stubborn man.\n\n\u201cIf this fails, I will move,\u201d I said, blunt, because sometimes you need to give a friend a picture of the cliff you\u2019re willing to walk over. \u201cIf it works, you will find a way to pay for the duct tape that doesn\u2019t look like duct tape.\u201d\n\nShe grunted, which I have decided is her way of agreeing when her hair is too tight to allow yes. \u201cYou\u2019ll need permits,\u201d she said, and then she signed the bottom of a paper and made the permits appear by reminding the universe who she is.\n\nGideon arrived last with a bucket of river stones the color of history. He ran his hands over the ducting like he was testing a horse, and the oven did not buck him because the oven is smart enough to know loyalty when it sees it. \u201cYou need ballast,\u201d he said, handing me the chain he took off a retired anchor. \u201cYou need to tie it to something people already agree not to move.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if it doesn\u2019t want to stay?\u201d I asked quietly, thinking of other things I had strung with intention only to find they preferred the edge.\n\n\u201cThen you tell it a story about what happens when the river runs backward,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll listen.\u201d\n\nWe fired the Retort with nothing in its mouth first, because even a hungry creature deserves a dry run. The oven glowed like a blush. Heat licked the ducts and went where it was supposed to go because Nate had promised to wring its neck if it tried any tricks. The capture jars\u2014old demijohns I\u2019d lined with the same slurry and wrapped in copper like fancy bottles who had married money\u2014fogged and then cleared and then stayed clear, as if we had put a net over a song and learned to hum in harmony. Etta came in with a tray of scones that tasted like penance and triumph and stood with her fists on her hips like a saint who had criticized God and found Him open to notes. \u201cWhen do you feed it?\u201d she said, as one does when one has watched someone perfect their oven and is ready to put in bread.\n\n\u201cAt night,\u201d I said. \u201cNot because it\u2019s skulking. Because I want it to learn what darkness is for.\u201d\n\nWe made a coat. I cut fire blankets into panels and stitched them with dull gold and thread I pulled from a rope, the kind of rope men have made and unmade their futures on. I lined it with foil that had once wrapped chocolates in a factory that wanted to pretend it was a cathedral, and I wrote sigils on the hems that said things like stay and things like consent. I tucked iron filings into the collar. I sewed my mark into the left wrist and left the right bare, because there should be a place for her to get out if she needs to remind me we make mistakes when we make prisons. This is the part no one sees when they come in for a button and a blessing and leave feeling lighter; the part where my teeth ache and my eyes go spiritless from looking at cloth until it becomes air. I bled on the sleeve and let it dry instead of washing it out like a good tailor. I want the garment to know whose blood makes its candor possible.\n\nOn the third day, the wind said the thing the mirror had promised. It changed direction without asking permission and brought with it a low note that made every bottle on the shelf in the back of my shop hum a sympathetic tune. The lake pressed its flat hand on the mouth of the river and said, go back. The river laughed the way a person laughs when you tell a joke that has sat too long in your pocket warming up on your leg: surprised and relieved in equal measure. Eloise texted me a weather map with an arrow and the word well. Gideon sent a picture of water shouldering itself up the wrong stair. Aunt Sable left a voicemail that was just a long exhale and then, at the end, \u201cDon\u2019t get in over your eyebrows, June-bug. Call me if you have to spit.\u201d\n\nI baited my trap like an honest liar. I filled a black bag with labels I had peeled and promises I had made and stuck all over my shirts like armor. I wrote on the outside in my neatest hand: Everything I am too tired to sort. I set it by the mouth of the Retort and left the door cracked like a lover. I unscrewed the bulb over the back door so the alley wouldn\u2019t look like a stage. I put on the fire coat and felt heavier and safer and too warm and not warm enough. I tucked the marble in my pocket because the storm wanted to watch. I waited with my palms on the edge of the oven like it was a table I trusted with family recipes.\n\nShe came without drama. She came like a woman who has been doing night work for years and knows doors by their creak and steps that don\u2019t rat out your presence. She put her hand on the bag and then on the oven and then she looked up like she had been hearing my voice for days and finally decided to stand where the sound was. I opened my mouth and told her the truth first, because I am superstitious about beginnings, because lies are mean if you let them start things. \u201cI want to keep you,\u201d I said. \u201cNot like a coin in a pocket. Like a language. Like a stove you ask to make soup and it doesn\u2019t catch the curtains. I want to give you a job you can live with.\u201d\n\nShe tilted her head, measuring me against herself, measuring the oven against her hand\u2019s memory of flame. \u201cWhat if your city loves me more for the spectacle?\u201d she asked, with a vanity I have earned and not enjoyed.\n\n\u201cThen I will ruin your spectacle with usefulness until even the men who love a problem for the way it makes their faces look cannot deny you improved their air,\u201d I said, and the coat made a tiny sound when I breathed that told me I was wearing a promise I might not yet have the credit for.\n\nThe wind shoved, and the river, stubborn as family, shoved back. The water at the quick-pour under the bridge tried to climb and then got tired and swallowed. The air tasted metallic; you never forget that taste when you have dragged a thunderstorm inside to meet your mother. She put her hands into the sleeves I held out and the coat took her like a story takes a listener who was ready all along. The iron filings murmured the names of tools. The foil whispered about candy. The gold thread sang low. She hissed when the hem touched her calves, not with pain, but with recognition.\n\n\u201cThree nights,\u201d she said again, but there was relief in it now, and a little threat, the way you tell a child it is bedtime even though the child put themselves to sleep on the floor an hour ago.\n\n\u201cWe have tonight,\u201d I said. \u201cAnd then the river will make its decision about direction. You said fourth; I\u2019m using the third.\u201d I opened the Retort\u2019s mouth and it breathed in a way that made the hairs on my neck consider retreating to another head. I put the bag in. I put my hand on her back like you would on the ribcage of a horse, and we sent it through together. The heat rose, but it didn\u2019t claw. The ducts stayed quiet, but not silent. The capture bottles fogged, cleared, held. The slurry smelled like old sugar and boundary. The triangle drawn on the oven door with grease smudged and slipped and then failed to hold shape. The coat brightened along the seams as if someone inside had remembered how to be seen without being caught.\n\nWe stood like that, two women leaning on a machine, any picture of a future that wants to get better needing too many hands to keep its shape. When the first tile fell from the mold, it made a sound like coins, like rain hard enough to wash even the stubborn corners. It was ugly in the way that newborn things are ugly before you bathe them and kiss them and teach them to do anything but eat. I pried it up with a flat iron and held it between fingers ready for blisters. It was a green the lake sometimes is when it has been arguing with the sun all afternoon. It held a triangle caught in a net of my mark, and for a second that might have been a year I thought about all the floors I could make.\n\nShe leaned her head on my shoulder and we were the same height because of course we are. She smelled like burnt sugar and riverside weeds and fear I\u2019ve almost learned to love. Outside, the river snapped and went the wrong way like a laugh that turns into a sob and then finds itself made of both. The streetlights shifted their reflections. The gulls panicked, then decided this too was a miracle they could shove their bodies around. Somewhere uptown, a man opened his door and told his dog this was weather and the dog believed him. Etta texted me a picture of a pot of chili because she cannot watch and not feed. Aunt Sable sent me a message with three words\u2014Do. Not. Blink.\u2014and it made me laugh, which was the same as crying, which was the same as deciding we could have one night of stranger tides and not be ruined.\n\nWe fed the Retort until the edges of my vision went soft and came back. We stacked the tiles like city planning. We watched the capture jars cloud and clear, cloud and clear, and every time the breath didn\u2019t escape my lungs unclenched a little more. We did not speak much because some work is communion and some is a kind of court. When the oven coughed, we let it. When the coat cooled, I did not take it off her because the night had decided to be the kind of night that will use you for kindling if you let your skin show. We stood and watched the river pretend to be a different river and I thought: I will take her to the council with the coat on and let them look. I will take a tile and set it on Eloise\u2019s desk and tell her to step on it. I will hand one to Pastor Lennox and tell him to put it in his basement and learn the names for the parts of his furnace. I will ask the boy on Thirteenth if he wants to build a fox that runs on a better fire.\n\nThe Retort sighed when we closed her mouth for the night and it sounded like a woman who, after a week of cleaning up other people\u2019s meals, has one put in front of her and decides to sit. The wind kept pushing. The river kept arguing. The street cats took cover in places they forgot to tell each other about. I turned to my other self and found that while I had been busy not blinking, she had taken half a step into me. It wasn\u2019t dramatic. It was an inch and a question. I didn\u2019t move away. The coat stitched light along her wrist where my mark lives, and I understood the only simple thing left to understand: the only way out of some habits is through. I think we slept standing up. I think the river carried us both in the same direction for once, even if it was the wrong one for a while. I think the gulls forgave us temporarily. I think tomorrow we will wake stiff and greedy for coffee and stubborn about hope. I think the tiles will cure overnight and my hands will remember the weight. I think I will show up to the meeting with ash under my nails and a new kind of evidence that wants to be touched and not just seen.\n\nWhen dawn found us, it had trouble deciding where to put itself. That kind of confusion makes accidents, but it also makes inventions. I opened my door and the night fell out in a lump and the morning scooped it back because mornings are good at pretending they anticipated everything. The air had that washed-out taste after a storm when everything looks newly painted and most of it is just old and wet. We took the coat off and it was like peeling a label from a jar that will never be as clean as you want it. She stood in her green, then she took the sleeve and laid it over my arm like a bandage and I let her. \u201cTwo more,\u201d she said, and I knew what the numbers meant. \u201cDon\u2019t humiliate me by making me useless. Nobody in this town deserves a saint.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never made one,\u201d I said, and we both tried not to smile like we shared the joke that my mother did not teach me and the river did. We went inside and I made tea that tasted faintly of the slurry because I hadn\u2019t washed the cup as well as a girl who lives alone is supposed to. We split a scone and it crumbled into a map that looked nothing like this town and everything like it. The Retort ticked as it cooled. The tiles clicked like teeth. The river ran backward again and then remembered itself and was forgiven. We cleaned our hands and the grey came off easy and not at all. I put the first tile in my bag and the second in my pocket and the third in the place where I keep my fear of being caught. I put on my boots and my patience and my plan. I called Gideon and he said, I\u2019ll be there if it floods in the room like it always does. I called Eloise and she said, don\u2019t give them anything they can call pretty without having to pay for it. I called Aunt Sable and she said, hush and listen, and in the hush I heard my mother say, that will do, June, and I didn\u2019t cry because I needed my eyes to see if the flames stayed where we told them to live.",

                              "content": "Eloise drove the meeting like she drives everything, with her shoulders and with a refusal to let her hair move unless it has been consulted. City Hall smells like old paper and a lemon cleaner that no longer believes in lemons. People came because they had decided the best way to spend a Thursday was to dress themselves in certainty and throw it at each other until something stuck. I walked in with the tiles wrapped in a towel that had been a shirt of my mother\u2019s when she thought she might be a woman who wore white. The weight in my bag was not enough to break a strap, but it was enough to change my gait from customer to witness.\n\nThe men who want the glass program gone had printed handouts with flames where glass bottles should be. Someone had photoshopped my sign into one of the images and made the needle in it a spear. Pastor Lennox sat in the back with his hands folded and his tie pin aimed like an argument. Etta commandeered a row with three women whose hands are always damp with dishwater and never tremble. Gideon stood by the window where he could see the river if it decided to come inside to listen. The boy from Thirteenth had found a corner to lean his fox against. It was unmistakable even unfinished: ten tails lifting like whispers, impossible and sure. The fox\u2019s face was cleverly built from a plastic bin lid cut into confidence.\n\nEloise tapped her pen, then tapped the wood with the gavel because the room needed to be reminded that wood has opinions. \u201cWe are not here to ask if witches exist,\u201d she said, and that was mercy and also a warning. \u201cWe are here to decide if we are going to pretend we can save money by throwing a kind of hope away.\u201d\n\nA man in a hat shaped like a decision raised his hand and didn\u2019t wait for permission. \u201cWe cain\u2019t have bins on fire,\u201d he announced in a voice like a won argument. \u201cIt looks bad. It is bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is,\u201d I said, before anyone else could, because I am tired of letting the wrong people have the first true sentence. I walked to the front and the city clerk who hates women with bags pretended not to hate mine. I put a tile on the floor of the aisle. You could make a religion out of watching people decide whether or not they are willing to step on something when they do not know if it is a trap. I stepped first. It was cool with a warmth underneath, the way some people are in public. \u201cWe burned what would have been burned anyway,\u201d I said, and a wave of incorrect understanding went through the room and broke. \u201cNo,\u201d I amended, because I refuse to be adopted by their stories. \u201cWe burned what was going to be burned wrong, and we told it where to live afterward. Pick it up.\u201d\n\nPastor Lennox rose without being called like we were in a service after all and lifted the tile as if it might have a pulse. The green had cured overnight into something that held the light in its teeth. The triangle was caught, line broken over my mark and then bent into new angles that didn\u2019t remember being vicious. You could see the breath trapped in it if you knew breath has a shape when it is tired enough. He passed it to the man in the hat and the man did not want to hold it and he did anyway because people like him will never turn down an opportunity to prove they are not afraid of women\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d someone called, a woman with a baby in a carrier who was telling me she wanted to be told, not scared.\n\n\u201cHeat that would otherwise go wandering,\u201d I said. \u201cA little shame. Bits of conversations that were happening in alleys when we were asleep. There are chemicals too.\u201d I glanced at Eloise and she gave me the go-ahead to be more exact. \u201cWe captured volatiles from polyethylene and a tantrum, and we tied them to ceramic with a slurry of ash and river. We made the breath honest. We\u2019re measuring the capture with proper instruments borrowed from the college because I want numbers, not just poetry. Right now it\u2019s a pilot that works in my alley and uses regret as fuel. I want it to be a line item.\u201d\n\nA cheer began, then remembered itself and turned into clapping that belongs to meetings. The man in the hat frowned like he had been asked to parent a nephew. \u201cWhat happens when the witches move?\u201d he demanded, which was a nicer version of, what happens when June leaves or fails us.\n\n\u201cThen you will have to love it enough that it stays,\u201d I said, which is not how budgets work and also how they do. \u201cOr you will hire a woman who knows how to stitch and how to heat without terror.\u201d\n\nGideon raised a hand and the room let him interrupt because they have seen what he carries up the bank. \u201cI have two boats,\u201d he said. \u201cIf this program goes, I\u2019ll have three. I\u2019d rather have a kiln in a lean-to than another stretch of river tied to my stern.\u201d\n\nPastor Lennox surprised me by coming forward. He set the tile on the edge of Eloise\u2019s dais and then did something genuinely humble. He stepped on it. He put his weight down. He closed his eyes. When he opened them he said, \u201cIt sounds like nothing,\u201d and I saw how hard he worked to make everything sound like God. \u201cWe can put one in the church basement where the furnace coughs in winter. We have a fan that pulls air from the street. Let us catch something and prove it to the stubborn.\u201d\n\nEloise\u2019s face did the math of how many ways she was going to be scolded for whatever came out of her mouth. \u201cMotion to maintain glass and to fund a pilot capture for non-compliant combustion,\u201d she said briskly, and the room murmured because she knows how to make things sound like they\u2019ve already been passed. \u201cMotion to not let the word witch be the reason we cut something that works.\u201d She looked at me. \u201cMotion to requisition that ugly pizza oven from our storeroom that no one could bring themselves to throw away because we are emotionally attached to our leftovers.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecond,\u201d said Etta, because she will marry Eloise to her job over and over until one of them is allowed to rest. A councilman whose wife does not let him leave the house with a plastic straw voted no so loudly his neck vein flexed. Two men abstained because they had never been taught that choosing is a form of spellcasting. The yeses were not loud. They were enough. It is a kind of love to be enough.\n\nAfter, a woman with a gull on her shirt came to me with her mouth set like a hospital. She had the sharp look of the newly bereft who have already forgiven you because it is easier to carry forgiveness than vengeance when you have to also carry groceries. \u201cI saw the pictures,\u201d she said, soft so the room would not decide to possess our conversation. \u201cI saw what they put in its gut. I want to put one of those in my kitchen.\u201d Her finger touched the tile and came away clean. \u201cI want to stand on something that used to be a problem and have it feel like floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring you one,\u201d I promised, because there are things you only promise to women like that, and you keep them because otherwise the tiles are just pretty. \u201cPut it by your door. You\u2019ll feel the air change.\u201d\n\nOutside, the wind was still doing the thing where it tries on hats and forgets where it left the one it needed. The boy from Thirteenth waited for me with his fox. Up close the creature was a joy and a warning. He had cut tails from milk jugs that had held a hundred kinds of sweetness and no one remembers them once they\u2019re empty. He had fused them to a backbone made from a ruined crate I recognized. In the center he had left a cavity the size of a beating. \u201cIt needs a heart,\u201d he said, as if that were a normal thing to say in public.\n\nI put my hand in my bag and my fingers knew which tile to find. It wasn\u2019t perfect. Nothing perfect belongs in a creature that plans to move. I gave it to him flat across both hands so he knew it was a gift that asked him to decide. He took it like a boy who has been hungry too long takes a bowl he intends to wash afterward. He fitted it into the fox. The tails lifted like a choir considering their entrance. He smiled\u2014not polite, not for me\u2014the kind you cannot teach and want to protect anyway.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t let anyone make you make dolphins,\u201d I said, and he laughed the way a kid laughs when you name a ghost he thought only he could see.\n\nBack in the shop, the tiles looked like a stack of decisions. The Retort\u2019s mouth, when I opened it, sighed me into the afternoon. We brought the capture jars to the college and made a professor cry by admitting magic and measurement have always been married and we\u2019re just finally throwing them a dinner with witnesses. Nate came by with bolts and his grin and said he\u2019d scrounge us a proper hood from a restaurant that had died quietly in August. He winked and left a bag of washers that a person far from here might call charms. People brought offerings: a length of copper pipe that had outlived three kitchens, a stack of bricks with names scratched in, a ceramic rooster whose owner claimed it woke up and crowed the morning she decided to leave her husband and therefore might give us one good loud warning when we needed it.\n\n\u201cNight Two,\u201d she said at dusk without bothering the mirror, without making the hair on the back of my neck try to run. She stood in the doorway like a memory I\u2019d been expecting and didn\u2019t dread because I had given her a job. The coat waited on the hook with the patience of a garment that knows it has become a tool and a myth. When I helped her into it we didn\u2019t look at each other\u2019s eyes. The skin there is honest to a fault.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do when we were small?\u201d I asked as we fed the bag we had collected at the transfer station into the Retort in two careful pieces, because sometimes the ritual is in not pretending you can swallow whole. \u201cWhat did you burn for me that I could not stand to see disappear the slow way?\u201d\n\nHer mouth twitched. It wasn\u2019t a smile; it was a muscle remembering practice. \u201cThe notes we wrote to boys before we learned how to want without apology,\u201d she said first, and it made me weirdly fond of us. \u201cThe white gloves your mother insisted you wear to Aunt Sable\u2019s church the three times she felt a failure for not giving you pews and thought she could mend it with lace. The photographs of the car. The final letter from your father\u2019s one good week. The wrappers from the candy we ate on a dock the day we watched a boat go where it was not tied to go.\u201d She slid a look at me because we both remember the scraping panic that comes when water refuses to play by the rules you admire. \u201cI burned our shame when it got heavy. I burned our boredom because it was louder than prayer.\u201d\n\nI felt the coat lift at the shoulder like a breath. We watched the jars milk and then clear, and the calm that came into the room was not quiet. It was something like competence, which is rarer than peace and twice as holy. \u201cYou set the trash can behind the first apartment on fire,\u201d I said after a while, the words coming out on a leash I had never tried to put on them before.\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d she said, not proud and not sorry. \u201cYou were fourteen, and your mother had started sleeping on the couch because the bed had become a continent where each of you tried and failed not to colonize each other. You wanted everything fast. I obliged. Aunt Sable came with a bucket and a warning and a glamour to keep Mrs. Calabrese from stepping out onto her stoop and starting a decade\u2019s worth of trouble with her mouth. She told me to get out of your legs unless I planned to teach you how to run. I left and I waited. You named me when you couldn\u2019t sleep for the first time and syllabled the sound a bag makes when a match loves it. I like my name. Don\u2019t take it if you don\u2019t mean to wear it.\u201d\n\nThe tile from that burn came out mean and beautiful. It had a vein of red in it like a vein in a wrist, and it embarrassed me to want it. I cooled it on the table that has held every mistake I\u2019ve ever managed to recover into usefulness. I put my palm on it and felt the hum. It was not dangerous. It would be if I put it under a pillow. We stack our hums in foolish places.\n\nThe man the sunburned woman had called \u201che\u201d tried to set the Retort on fire on Night Two because of course he did. Show any town a solution and it will cough up a person with a hobby of breaking tools. He came with a can of accelerant and a mask he bought because a forum told him masks make men impervious to consequence. He sloshed inexpertly and lit expertly and the flames did what flames know. They licked for edges. The coat hummed and pulled the heat into itself and laid it gently down like a child who has thrown up in the back seat and is ashamed. Gideon, who knows how to be in three places at once when water is involved, arrived with the smaller boat\u2019s pump rigged to a barrel and turned the arc into a line that convinced the fire it owed us something. The Retort\u2019s mouth yawned and took what it was offered. The capture jars clouded in outrage. The tiles stacked their usual steady clatter. The man ran because his mask told him the story of vanishing. Nate chased him halfway to the old tannery before remembering he\u2019s built for lifting and swearing, not sprinting in the dark.\n\nAfter we cleaned the scorch marks that the Retort had the decency to keep on its own skin, I sat on the floor with my back to the oven and my knees up. Fear is not a spell; it is a door you have to unlatch with hands that shake. \u201cYou built me a mouth,\u201d she said, and that was a kind of apology and also a covenant. \u201cI won\u2019t keep going to alleys where I am uninvited. I like being asked. It reminds me I was a choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cStay,\u201d I said, to practice for strangers. \u201cWork. Do not confuse hunger with need.\u201d We say this to babies because we are trying to raise ourselves.\n\nOn the morning of the third day the river pretended to be tired of tricks. It looked like any river again to anybody who has never had to stand on a bank and persuade it by name. Aunt Sable arrived without warning in a sweater the color of a bruise that is almost better. Her mouth looked like it had been set in the night and would not unscrew for anybody but me. She kissed my eyebrows and my cheekbones and the top of my head, which is what she does when she is counting what I have left. \u201cYou look thinner in the ways that matter,\u201d she said, then put her hands on the Retort and hissed a little through her teeth like a smith greeting a friend. \u201cShe likes you. You feeding her regular? You letting her rest?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I said, because I have my pride and because it was true. \u201cHe came with a can last night.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoney,\u201d she said, rolling her eyes in a circle that took in every bad idea a man has had within a hundred-mile radius, \u201cthey always do. You cannot fix making without breaking and you cannot make breaking honorable. You can only make it expensive.\u201d\n\nWe took a tile to Pastor Lennox and I let him put it by the vent in the basement. He looked at me like a man looks at a woman right before he asks a question he knows is going to be a foolish one unless she decides to treat it kindly. \u201cDo you pray when you work?\u201d he ventured, trailing the P like he might need to apologize for it.\n\n\u201cI count,\u201d I said, because that is the thing closest to true. \u201cStitches. Bolts. Breaths. I say names. I say yes. It does something to my mouth that prayer probably does to yours.\u201d I left him with the tile and his basement smelling faintly of sugar that burned for a good reason.\n\nEloise met me on the steps with a paper bag and an expression like she had just kissed a victory and it had bitten her. \u201cDo not let them make you a symbol,\u201d she said, thrusting the bag into my hands without ceremony. \u201cYou cannot be eaten for breakfast and expected to come back for dinner.\u201d I opened the bag and found six permits and a pair of gloves that fit and an orange I had not admitted to needing until it was in my palm.\n\n\u201cNight Three,\u201d my other self said at dusk, flipping the coat off the hook with only the flourish I would have allowed myself if I were alone. We had two bags, because I had spent the afternoon at the transfer station pulling triangles like thorns from the edges of lids and telling promising shapes they were not invitations. The Retort took them the way a grandmother takes a plate from a girl who has learned how to feed her: not surprised, still grateful. The jars did their cloud-clear, which had become a metronome for a kind of music I did not want to dance to and could not stop hearing. Outside, the wind from the lake went sulky and tried to slip around the edges of buildings without being noticed. Heat has its rites, and so does cold.\n\nWe did not talk much. When the tiles came, the third night\u2019s were different. They were veined with something that looked like writing. The marks were not mine. They were not the triangle\u2019s. They were little rumors of letters that I will convince you one day are a script spoken by rivers when they are trying to teach steel to think. I stacked them carefully and then took one to the river, because I am not an idiot about payment. I set it on the bank and the water lapped it like a name. I let the river keep it. The tile slid under with a contentment I have never been able to give anything other than tea.\n\nAt the mirror after, I called her and she came and she looked like me without anything to do. It is not a flattering expression. \u201cIf we put you into a tile,\u201d I said, hating myself for the thought even as I loved myself for being willing to have it, \u201cwould you stay where I put you until I asked again?\u201d\n\nShe smiled, small and not for show. \u201cIf you trap me, you\u2019ll spend the rest of your life carrying me around looking for a way to teach me without starving me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather wear the coat and learn to eat like a person. That is your vanity talking when it asks for artifact. Keep a piece of me in a pocket if it helps you sleep. Let the rest stay in the part of your mouth that makes yes. Don\u2019t put me behind glass.\u201d\n\nWe did not leave each other that night because there are nights when leaving is silly theater and there are nights when leaving is necessary. We slept in shifts, stretched in the coat, with the Retort ticking like a polite animal. At dawn I carried tiles around town like a green Mary handing out a sacrament nobody has agreed on yet. I put one in the co-op by the compost bins. I put one under the counter at Conklin\u2019s where the new oven huffs like a dog with a grudge. I left one for the woman with the gull shirt and she sent me a photograph of the square by her door with the caption, it looks like a lake, and a second message that made my lungs widen: it feels like opening my window.\n\nThe boy from Thirteenth came in without knocking because I had told him to stop knocking. He held the fox. He had given it eyes made from the bottoms of bottles I had seen on my own sill last spring. He had put the tile-heart in and sealed it with copper wire braided into nerve. \u201cIt runs,\u201d he said, breathless the way boys pretend not to be, and he set it down and it did. It did not move in a way that makes science happy. It moved the way you feel a thing in your peripheral, and if you turn to look at it properly it firmly refuses to be caught doing anything that could get it in trouble. It made a sound like a kettle that knows better. He looked at me and tried to play bored and then couldn\u2019t. \u201cThey asked me for dolphins again,\u201d he said, rolling his eyes so big you could take a small boat into them.\n\n\u201cSay no,\u201d I said, and then, because that is not as easy as it comes out of my mouth, I reached under the counter and gave him a roll of wire and a pair of pliers that had belonged to my grandfather and are the closest thing I own to a blessing. \u201cWhen you have told them no enough times, make the thing that refuses to be a compromise. Then go to the river and ask it to mind your tails when you\u2019re asleep.\u201d\n\nHe hefted the pliers like a boy hefts a responsibility. \u201cYou want your tile back when I\u2019m done?\u201d he asked, manners winning out over art for a second.\n\n\u201cLet it run on,\u201d I said, and he grinned with his whole face and fled because boys know when to leave before you change your mind and give them rules they will enjoy breaking and also apologize for.\n\nThe man with the accelerant was arrested because he had posted footage of his own crimes with captions that suggested he thought arson is a form of commentary when it is only a form of cowardice. Eloise told me this in a message that did not enjoy delivering satisfaction. She added: strings were pulled. I wrote back: who holds the other end, and she sent me a photograph of a hand I know I will recognize if it ever passes me a bowl at a potluck. The city is small. There are not that many hands. You always know whose hands are doing the breaking.\n\nNight Three ended, but the heat did not go away. Heat never goes away. It moves its chair. It learns new names. It gets a job. I put the coat on the hook and the hook bent a fraction and then straightened as if it was willing to be stronger for us. She and I stood in the kitchen. We looked at the jars and the tiles and the list I had written without admitting I had written it\u2014places that need one, people who will use them, a corner in my own shop where the air goes stale. \u201cDo we braid?\u201d I asked, because sometimes you are brave enough to ask the question your aunt warned you lies under other questions like a river under a street.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d she said, with a kindness that relieved and annoyed. \u201cYou are not done liking me separate.\u201d\n\n\u201cWill we always clean up in the night?\u201d I pressed, thinking of women who age into the kind of tired that doesn\u2019t squeak anymore.\n\n\u201cIf we are lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we are not, we will tend fires we did not build for people who do not say that we did. Either way, we will get very good at sleeping on our feet.\u201d\n\nOn the morning the river remembered itself entirely and stopped playing the backward game, the council brought cameras. Eloise told them to aim at the tiles and at the duct and not at my face more than they needed to. Pastor Lennox quoted a verse about furnace and proof and did not make it about me, which I marked down as growth for both of us. Etta brought donuts iced the color of lake-glass and set them in a neat row that said: look how delicious sustainable can be. Gideon stood with one hand on the ducting as if the city were a boat that might untie itself and drift. The boy with the fox came because he likes to be where grown-ups pretend to know what to do next. Aunt Sable wore a dress with anchors and a smile like, if anybody calls this a miracle in my hearing I will make sure they are put to work.\n\nWe fired the Retort for demonstration, but I kept the burn small because the only thing better than spectacle is refusal. It glowed, but not spectacularly. It breathed, but not dramatically. The capture jars did their trick and then were just glass again, empty and suggestive. The tile we pulled was ordinary. I wanted them to see the fact that ordinary can be savior. Eloise spoke in that way she has that makes it sound like we are all in a choir and suddenly found our note. \u201cWe will pilot. We will measure. We will not cut glass,\u201d she said, leaning on the gavel hand the way she does when she thinks she might cry and would rather break the table.\n\nAfter, a girl who works in the library in the afternoons and reads tarot in her kitchen at night came to me with a book on kilns she had nicked out of the discard pile. It had been stamped withdrawn in the tidy grief of librarians. \u201cI thought you might like to keep it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were going to pulp it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate pulping,\u201d I said, turning the pages and feeling the comfort of diagrams that believe if you follow instructions you can hold fire without apology. \u201cThey always think it\u2019s mercy.\u201d\n\nThe wind laid down. The river curled around its own ankle and looked up, seductive again instead of churlish. I took a tile to the Nestl\u00e9 grounds and laid it at the foot of a wall that had held back sweetness for too long. I chalked a new sentence under the old chalk: we are the same only to the degree that we forgive the ways we aren\u2019t. I rubbed it with my sleeve and let the brick decide how much to keep. I went home and sorted. Clear to clear. Brown to brown. Green into green. Plastics into the bag I will not put to flame unless I am wearing the coat and the river has been told and the duct is happy. Metal, paper, cardboard cut down to rectangles that stack like a version of my hope. My hands still smelled like sugar that went hard and then learned to be useful. My breath fogged the glass enough to write on it with my finger. I wrote my name. I wrote hers. I wiped both off with the heel of my hand and watched the river through the smear and thought, I will build a floor out of our worst and then I will dance on it until the tired in this city learns to be proud.",

It wasn\u2019t relief; relief has a softness the wind did not grant us. It was a recalibration. In my pocket the marble pressed at my hip in slow circles as if the weather inside it had been taught to dance a box step. I opened Stitch & Solder to the cautious bell of the afternoon and stood for a long moment with both hands on the counter, feeling the leftover heat in the wood, the extra heartbeat thin work gives it. If I had been a different kind of woman I would have written down the day on an index card and filed it under proof, to be pulled out later when doubt got clever. I have never managed to keep files outside my own ribs.\n\nThe first visitor after the spectacle smelled like lake wind trapped in a car. She had state in the cut of her jacket and DEC on a small enamel pin that had been chosen by someone who thought plants and letters shared a joke. She introduced herself as Delia Mott and didn\u2019t offer a hand. I can forgive that in winter and in women who are more used to touching water than skin.\n\n\u201cI saw the jars,\u201d she said. She had a face that had grown allergic to adjectives. \u201cI saw the test numbers the college sent over. I don\u2019t like your words for it, but I don\u2019t mind that you have them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like my words,\u201d I said. \u201cYou can have your own and we can point them at each other like flashlights and see if the same corners get lit.\u201d\n\nA corner of her mouth considered becoming a smile and thought better of it. She took out a small device that looked like the descendant of a compass and a toy. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a bale fire,\u201d she said, in the tone of a woman warning a friend about a tendency with a name. \u201cNot because of the rumor kids. Because of physics and carelessness. The stacks at the station have been going up in the region. Once one takes, it burns like a book you thought wouldn\u2019t keep your attention. Hours. Sometimes days. Plastics throw tantrums when you gang them up and squeeze the air out, and when they go it\u2019s a dragon you don\u2019t get to befriend. You try to smother, it sulks and burns deeper. Water makes it mad. Foam drowns dollars and pride. If you\u2019re going to keep your mouth, you\u2019ll need to teach it to eat big.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a Retort,\u201d I said, refusing to apologize to her invisible colleagues for capitalization. \u201cI have ducting. I have a coat that can withstand more heat than I like admitting fits my shoulders. I have a city with too many hands and not enough patience. I have\u2014\u201d I didn\u2019t mean to say I have her, but the sentence tilted and there she was anyway, my other self shifting inside me in the way a cat shifts behind a curtain and you\u2019re aware of both the moving and the choice to let it remain unseen. I did not flinch. \u201c\u2014help.\u201d\n\nDelia looked at me the way the river looks at a new dock. \u201cYou\u2019ll have resistance,\u201d she said, a little tired now, like a woman who has had too many meetings about ash. \u201cYou\u2019ll have someone tell you that your jars are masquerade. You\u2019ll have a man say he knows what fire wants because he has a grill and an opinion. You\u2019ll have to decide whether your coat makes you a firefighter or a hazard. The forms aren\u2019t made for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never looked at a form and thought it was,\u201d I said. \u201cBut I can hold a pen. I can wait. I can show up where the fire is doing its worst and turn its mouth toward work.\u201d\n\nShe tilted the device at my shelves and it clicked as if it had found a toy it would later complain about having to share. \u201cI hate that magic gets there before money,\u201d she said flat, and there was a kindness in it truer than any of the compliments I had been handed that morning like cheap mints. \u201cCall me when the bale goes.\u201d\n\nShe left me her card with a number written in pencil on the back, which is how serious women tell you where they will really be. When she left, the bell protested as if it didn\u2019t like being asked to chime twice so close together. I put the card on the mirror and the mirror considered it and then, with the polite vanity reflective surfaces possess, returned my face with two expressions: the one that believes in permits, and the one that burns them.\n\nWe had one full night with no crisis and I used it improperly. I should have slept. I made more of the coat instead. Not another whole; I am not so hubristic as to think I could duplicate the way the first one learned my breath. I made cuffs that I could hand to other people so they could steady a pipe without losing their skin. I stitched a cap for Nate, against his insistence that he has never been burned in his life. I lined the insides with my dull gold and my superstition. Aunt Sable sat at my table and pretended not to supervise while she picked parsley heads into a bowl and told me about the kind of forecasters who develop crushes on storms.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re mother loved a ruin,\u201d she said suddenly, the parsley scent brighter for being recalled. \u201cIt made her feel braver. Don\u2019t repeat her bravest part. Pick another.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you have me pick?\u201d I asked, not irritated, exactly, but aware that I was a tendon away from it.\n\n\u201cPick staying,\u201d she said, as if she were asking me to pass the salt. \u201cPick boring. Pick the kind of magic that takes longer than anyone in a loud hat thinks they have.\u201d\n\nWe were almost done with the cuffs when Gideon knocked twice in a pattern he has agreed not to change on me. His hat was under his arm and his hair did that thing like it had argued with spray and lost. He looked older than yesterday and younger than last year, which meant something had been found and something had been spared. \u201cIt\u2019s started,\u201d he said. \u201cNot the bale yet. Not there. Out by the field behind the old tannery. Plastic and leaves, which is a combination invented by a person who has never asked a fire what it wants to eat. Somebody took a picture and somebody else took a match. I tamped it with shovels and a boy, but it\u2019s crawling under like a secret. It\u2019ll find a stump and then we\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d\n\nI put down the cuff and picked up the coat. I wanted to have a ritual. I wanted to kiss the doorway, murmur to the jars, touch my mother\u2019s scissors with the back of my hand. I didn\u2019t. I tied my boots. I put the marble in my pocket so that when I put my hand there later looking for courage I would find weather instead. Sable caught my sleeve with two fingers. \u201cYou do not go looking for the girl when you are tired,\u201d she said. \u201cYou let her come to you when you\u2019ve already lit the stove and set the table. She behaves better when she feels expected.\u201d\n\nThe night over the field was the color of the underside of a dog\u2019s ear. You want to call it brown and you\u2019re wrong; there\u2019s more to it than that. You could hear the fire before you saw it. Low. Insulted. The pile itself wasn\u2019t large\u2014two yard bags loosed and a drift of leaves up against the chainlink, bottles and a broken tote, bits of plastic lawn edger that wanted to pretend they were snakes. But someone had laced the bags with something that made the flames talk in a way I recognized. The triangle had been drawn on the side of a half barrel. It looked tired of itself.\n\nWe did not perform. Gideon didn\u2019t add water. He shouldered the pump anyway because that is his way of not admitting he knows when he isn\u2019t needed. I shrugged the coat on and felt the heat hesitate like a sentence in a mouth that has learned the word if. I opened the Retort in my mind because the lean-to was too far and the duct was asleep. I have stitched enough to know that sometimes the tool is what you have where you are. I cupped my hands and made the kind of mouth you teach to a child when you teach them how to blow out a candle without spitting wax everywhere. She took my elbows; we both breathed.\n\nIt is not beautiful work. The smell fought back, sweet and ugly. The plastic shrieked in whatever register shame hums in. My hands shook with the effort of telling heat who is older. The air bent and the cool underlayer slipped forward. I felt the coat take it and slow it and send it where the jars in my head had been set. It occurred to me that I was being watched and should straighten my back; I did not. I made my back round around the burn and let the night make its own judgments. Gideon stood where men stand when they have been instructed by women without noticing. He did not speak. He adjusted the pump\u2019s intake like a person adjusting a halo they didn\u2019t agree to.\n\nWhen it was done, when the pile had become the kind of ash that contains both apology and potential regret, I chalked a small circle over the triangle on the barrel and the chalk found purchase on the soot like chalk always does. I drew my stitch over it and the line broke the line and something in me eased. On the ground, embedded in the dregs of the bag, a piece of plastic had fused into a shape you could mistake for a fish if you wanted to. I did not want to. I put it in my pocket and the marble sulked because it does not like company it did not choose.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d Gideon said, which meant: am I going to have to go to anyone\u2019s mother in the morning with my face arranged.\n\n\u201cNot kids,\u201d I said. \u201cBut not men either. Someone doing a ritual too careful for a teenage dare and too messy for a professional. Someone who read half a forum and none of a book. Someone who blew on a coal and liked the sound their own breath made.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if I had handed him a location. \u201cThe bales are stacked like graves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re dry under where the tarp doesn\u2019t reach. One spark. I told Nate to sit on them. He said he would. He won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe was right on both counts. The call came when the moon had been up long enough to make men ridiculous. I picked up the phone and I knew it before it spoke. The sound behind Nate\u2019s voice was the low hum of something that intends to be a roar. You can tell by the way it refuses to issue apologies on your timeline. \u201cIt\u2019s taken,\u201d he said, and his gum snapped once in the middle of the sentence like punctuation. \u201cMiddle of the stack, front left, next to the pallet with the bent nail. I got it isolated and I got cones and I got a kid with common sense standing in the road waving cars off. I don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn my way,\u201d I said, and put the coat on as if it were an argument I had been waiting my whole life to have. I did not put a hat on, because sometimes you have to let your scalp feel the weather or it will take its revenge in a less convenient circumstance. I texted Delia Mott and didn\u2019t wait for dots. I texted Eloise and didn\u2019t apologize. I told Aunt Sable to pretend I had not told her anything, and she hissed down the line with the tenderness of a kettle.\n\nWhen you see a bale fire for the first time you think very unkind thoughts about anyone who has ever used the word manageable in a meeting. They had put the stacks in neat rows as if neatness could teach vice lessons. The fire had found the seam in the front and it had chewed inward with the same patience I have for hems. The outward face looked ordinary\u2014flames flowered, smoke insisted\u2014and then the bale split and the belly of it glowed a terrible cherry, and I understood why you do not put your hands in the thing you have made, even if you love it. The air above it was a muscle flexed wrong. Nate stood with a hook and his cap and a face that said: I have been taller than most problems and this one has decided not to be impressed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t drown it,\u201d Delia said, coming up on my right with her device clipped to her jacket like a brooch that knows things. Her breath looked like mine in the cold. \u201cIf you drown it, it sulks and eats back. You have to give it a way out and stop the out from going into our air. It\u2019s an insult,\u201d she added, high enough for the fire to hear, \u201cthat it gets agreeable once it\u2019s been given a purpose.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsults I can handle,\u201d I said, and then louder, because the blaze knew my voice and I was not going to pretend otherwise. \u201cYou liked the coat. You liked the mouth. You liked being aimed. Here is a feast. Do not disgrace yourself.\u201d\n\nWe made a maw out of ugly things. Nate had a roll-off bin at the back, half full of things that can handle heat and things that pretend they can until they forget themselves. We tipped it empty with a racket to wake the men on the other side of town who pretend to hate witches and secretly get bored when nothing is on fire. Delia rigged a fan from the back of her truck and said nothing about the law. I tugged ducting into place with Gideon anchoring chain to the corner of the bale and did not think about how much of my life is literally duct tape and faith. We made the Retort\u2019s mouth at a distance, a cousin, an improvisation I would have laughed at in another chapter. I turned the capture jars into an array and pretended they were pretty on purpose. The coat sang under my hands, which is not a thing I admit to often and may not admit to again.\n\nShe came without being called separately. There are nights when I go looking for her; there are nights when she goes where fire is because our agreement was never about ownership. She slipped into the coat like the coat had missed her. She held the seam at the back of the makeshift duct with one hand and put the other on the bale, not on the flame but on the place heat makes in the air. The triangle had been painted on the pallet and then bled up into the wood like a fever dreaming of symbols. She looked at me and I drew my stitch over it in the air, and if anyone ever tries to tell you that gesture means nothing, send them to my alley and I will teach their bones to feel otherwise.\n\nThe first pull was easy. Fire loves to be asked. The second was insulted; we had tricked it into working. It tried to throw its smoke into our lungs and found the coat between us. The jars fogged and only one failed, out of six, which felt like a sin I could ask to be allowed to make again. Nate put the cap on the failed one with a hand steady enough to clip a bishop. Delia\u2019s device chattered and heeded her; she adjusted the fan with two fingers and the air changed by a degree you would miss if your blood didn\u2019t know. Gideon rigged the boat pump into a push and created a draft the bale could not argue with. The fire went under. It went up. It went where we told it to go. It behaved like a thing that had been given a chore with consequences and praise attached.\n\nOn the third pull I saw the thing I didn\u2019t want to see and the town will never know it almost cost them me. In the heart of the bale, lodged like a penny under a tongue, there was a toy car melted into a melt. It wasn\u2019t anything; it was a dollar store red with racing decals. It had caught and fused and seemed to grieve itself. It had the same make as the car my father had driven. That\u2019s all. That\u2019s nothing. That\u2019s everything, when you are already hot and your memory keeps rolled photographs in a drawer you do not always keep locked. The coat drew what was mine to draw and she reached out and put her hand, my hand, on my wrist where the mark sits. She squeezed once like a woman acknowledging that sometimes the burn is not chemistry. I turned my face away from the toy. The air filled my mouth and I did not die on it.\n\nDelia pointed at the pallet and I saw how the triangle had been made with a stencil, not a hand. It had been repeated with precision where there had been none anywhere else. The runes that frightened Eloise had a source you could clean. I chalked over it again, stitch and stitch, not because chalk can undo unreasonable men but because chalk is cheap and marks walls well. Nate muttered, \u201cI\u2019ll find who brings these boards and they will forget where they keep their lighter,\u201d and I did not tell him that vengeance is best spent on tools. I let him have it. He needed a job.\n\nWe pulled and we pulled and we stacked tiles on a pallet that had never asked to be better. The green in them was deeper than the morning\u2019s and the veins told a different story, a longer sentence about patience and irritation and the grace of not letting a thing you did once for spectacle turn into a habit. The firefighters came late not because they are lazy but because this town is held together with too few men in hats and too many fires. They stared and then they pretended they were not impressed and then one of them took a cuff and said, \u201cIf you have seven of these I will never again have to explain to a rookie why their eyebrows hurt,\u201d and I said, \u201cCome by the shop when your hands are clean.\u201d\n\nWhen the bale was over, when the heat had become agreeable to the degree that makes it almost not itself, the boy from Thirteenth appeared like a fox who had been told there were eggs and had come to check even if you had not told him gently. He had the sculpture, the tails lifted like flags in disdain of the hour. He had stitched scraps of the old municipal tarp into flanks and he had riveted pieces of hard plastic into tendons. The tile-heart glowed dull and dignified in its chest. He set the fox down near the stack and it shivered like fire does when it has been convinced to remember it can be light without showing off. He didn\u2019t speak. He looked at the men in hats like he knew they had names they never tell anyone because those names are tender. He looked at me as if he had promised himself a future that required me to be alive.\n\n\u201cYou going to put one of those green squares in my garage?\u201d Nate asked, which was as close to admiration as he is structured to be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put one in the bottom of the duct you haven\u2019t had time to fix for three months,\u201d I said, sweet as chili. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m going to invoice you a number so small you will be insulted and try to pay more, and then you will take me out to the brownfield and show me where the fence has been cut twice and you will pretend you didn\u2019t see it until I saw it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal,\u201d he said with dignity. He deserves a church for his dignity. He will never get one.\n\nDelia put a hand on my arm that felt like approval disguised as warning. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to scale this,\u201d she said, the we on her tongue and the policy in her shoulder, \u201cyou will need more jars, more hands, and fewer speeches. You will make enemies that are boring. Bureaucracy isn\u2019t a dragon you can charm. It\u2019s a fungus. You like fungi? You have to if you plan to stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am excellent at fungi,\u201d I said. \u201cI live in old buildings.\u201d\n\nWe stood there in our coats not admiring the sheen the fire had left on the night. The bale hissed when it found a wet bit and then stopped when it realized we weren\u2019t going to let it use the sound to distract us. Someone drove by and yelled something about witches that could have, in a good translation, meant thank you. The fox tilted its ten tails toward me and I put my hand on its head and it sank a fraction into the weight of me, like it had agreed to live in my city as long as we fed it the right kind of fire.\n\nAfter, after the after, when I had gone home and set the coat on the hook and my hands were steady again for almost three whole minutes, I took the fused fish out of my pocket and set it on the mirror. It looked cheap and shameful and I wanted to throw it into the deepest part of the river and dare the gulls to carry it back. The mirror made it into something else\u2014not prettier, and not excused. It made it into a lesson with a shape that could be taught. She stood behind me in the glass and we did not banter because we had both had enough of audiences. We stood like women in a kitchen after a wake, holding each other\u2019s elbows, telling each other with our bones that we have to eat in the morning and not eat fire.\n\nThe days that followed were busy in the way falls are busy when you\u2019ve dammed a creek for years and then give it a sluice. Tiles went out and not all of them came home to be cured on my table; people took them and thought to warm them on their own radiators and learned what happens when you try to rush a spell like you rush a stew. I replaced two with a smile and a lecture and one with a soft scold that made a woman cry in a way that made me leave her a cookie under the tile when I delivered it. Pastor Lennox put one by the furnace vent in the church basement and then on Sunday said nothing about it from the pulpit and that silence did a strange good. Eloise told me that there was a man in a long thread who had read three scientific abstracts about combustion and planned to use them to scold me in public; she printed the abstracts, highlighted the parts he would misuse, and carried them in her purse like a war prayer. Nate found the pallets with the triangle stencil and we followed them back to a lot where a man with a flag affixed to his truck in a way that hurt flag and truck both was willing to hold a match in front of us and ask if we felt safer. He did not meet my eyes when I stepped past him and drew chalk on his tailgate like a woman teaching a dog not to bark in the night.\n\nSome of the plastic cult, if they were that and not just a noise with hands, lost interest because we made it unglamorous. Some stuck around and carved sloppy triangles into snowbanks and plastic picnic tables and men\u2019s bathroom stalls, and the portion of my soul that got good at ignoring graffiti at sixteen put on work boots and kept working. Two boys came by the shop with cheeks pink from choosing that hour of night to be outside, and they put down a sack full of cigarette butts like they were paying tithes. \u201cWe don\u2019t smoke,\u201d one said defensively. \u201cWe just pick up.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do both,\u201d I said, handing them a tile they could take home to their mother as evidence of what they had been doing instead of what she thought. \u201cBut if you do both I will make you scrub my back alley with a toothbrush until you grow old.\u201d\n\nThey grinned with that particular seam of malice that lives next to sweetness in adolescents and that fuels revolutions when we manage to aim it correctly. The boy with the fox brought me a drawing that made me undo my coat because my chest had suddenly become too crowded: a road made of tiles, running along the river, children hopscotching with their lungs clear, their mothers chatting in a language of relief I have been trying to learn my whole life. \u201cIt\u2019s not to scale,\u201d he said, as if he had disappointed me, and I told him to leave the scale to the fish.\n\nAnd then the river decided to give me a gift I did not know how to receive and could not refuse. Gideon called at dawn when the light had just started to remember that there is a distinction between sky and water worth noting. His voice had a rasp in it I had not heard since the winter the car went under and never came up where it was supposed to. \u201cWe found one,\u201d he said, and he did not apologize for making me the kind of woman who is summoned by that sentence. \u201cNot him,\u201d he added, and the relief went through me like a flood that doesn\u2019t sweep things so much as rearrange them kindly. \u201cBut close enough. You\u2019ll want to see the way the streak sits on the windshield. You\u2019ll want to hear the trap loosen when we bring it up. You\u2019ll want to tell me if the river is being generous or cruel.\u201d\n\nThe Retort ticked as if it were listening. The coat waited on its hook like a dog who knows it will not be taken for a walk and graciously doesn\u2019t hold a grudge. I put on my boots. I put the marble in my pocket. I wrote a note for Etta and shoved it under her door where it would catch on the mat. I told Aunt Sable nothing, because she would know and be furious, and then forgive me in a tone that would pour molasses into my ears and make me feel twelve. I went where I always go when something old is about to come up: to the bank behind the old factory where the ground remembers permission to be unstable.\n\nGideon stood with his back to the truck crane that was doing its very best to pretend it knew this river and its temper. The men he had borrowed for the pull had that bowed head you only see at gravesides and in kitchens when babies are newly discovered. The cable slithered down into the brown and then tautened like a hymn. When the car came up it was so ordinary I had to close my eyes and make it something else to be able to bear looking at it. It was a mid-aughts sedan the color of bad rain. The algae had made lace along the dash. The glass had gone green in the way glass goes green when it has been promised a home underwater and then betrayed. The windshield streak he had spoken about was there\u2014a smear like something written and wiped away in a hurry.\n\nOn the hood someone had scratched the triangle years ago and had done a bad job. The base was intact. The point was blunted. The line through it had been hesitant. It had not been the symbol from the pallets. It had been an attempt by a person who had spent a lot of time waiting in this car and was trying to make their boredom into a geometry. In the passenger footwell, wrapped in a half-disintegrated grocery bag like an aunt who refused to go to church with bare arms, there was a tin with my mother\u2019s initials on it. You never recover from your mother\u2019s handwriting; it continues to instruct you about the shape of letters long after she stops correcting you at the table.\n\nGideon let me retrieve it. That is what love looks like in my town sometimes; men let women pull things out of the river that might break them, because the women will do it anyway and this way the men get to stand near enough to catch their elbows if they sway. The tin was light in the way of tins, which is to say it felt like an insult until you remembered it holds weight that is not measured in ounces. I opened it on the bank with my thighs bracing my elbows so I wouldn\u2019t scatter whatever was inside into the water like the ending to a tasteful movie. There was a photograph of me and my father on the day the dock we didn\u2019t own seemed to belong to us because we were so loud. There was a scrap of a map with a circle around the bend where we were standing, as if by circling a place you could persuade it not to misbehave. There was a piece of chalk. There was a key with no tag. There was a note. I recognized the stroke of my mother\u2019s angry cursive from the loop in the J.\n\nJune, it said, as if she had known where the tin would go and who would one day fish it up with hands that knew more than her twelve-year-old\u2019s had. If you are reading this, I am not mad at you for going to the river. Nobody will tell you this but the river listens when you aren\u2019t talking. Your father loved it wrong and he loved it right and both things can be true. Do not let them convince you that fire and water are enemies. People say that when they mean they don\u2019t want to have to learn to hold more than one kind of danger. Use the key for something besides leaving. Your Aunt Sable will pretend she knew about this tin and she did not, because I did not tell her, because sometimes you have to keep a secret to keep a person. I am sorry. I am not sorry.\n\nThere was no postscript. I put the tin back together in the order it had greeted me because I am a superstitious woman when it comes to sequences, and then I put it under my coat as if it needed warming. Gideon watched my face with the professional pity of a man who has lost enough to make him good at it and not so much that he has made a performance of his capacity. \u201cGenerous,\u201d he said, and I nodded because he was right. It is generous to give a thing back even if it is not the exact one you begged to see. It is generous to send up a reminder that symbols are sloppy and people are sloppier and you can spend your life scolding them for it or you can make an oven and teach the town how to feed it.\n\nOn the way home the road hummed under my tires like it had something to add and was waiting to be asked nicely. I took the long way by the Nestl\u00e9 grounds and chalked a sentence on the wall where the cutlery words had once been. The cutlery was gone; someone had come and collected it, perhaps with dreams of art or signs. The sentence had to be rewritten three times because when I tried to make it pretty the chalk broke, and when I made it ordinary it held. We will not throw the hard parts away, I wrote finally, because you can\u2019t. We will embed them. We will stand on them. We will learn to like the sound our feet make when they meet the proof.\n\nThat night I did a strange thing and I do not know whether it was wise. I took the key from the tin and I pressed it into the tile I had made the second night with the vein like a wrist. The tile took the impression like a good pupil and the key came away with a tiny kiss, green dust on its teeth. I put it on a cord and I put the cord around my neck because sometimes you have to leave a thing where your pulse can argue with it. She watched me do it and did not laugh. \u201cYou going to wear that when you go see the man who thinks burning wrong is a personality?\u201d she asked, and I told her, \u201cYes, and I\u2019m going to hand him a tile and dare him to stand on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake him stand on it in front of his friends,\u201d she said, pragmatic as kindling, and this, too, is love of a sort.\n\nI slept and woke and slept again because some days that is the work. I did not dream about cars or bales or gulls, which felt like a mercy. I dreamed about floors. Not pretty floors. Floors that have seen winter boots and babies and the corners of couches being dragged by women who don\u2019t have help. Floors embedded with green squares that hold the breath of the city so its children do not have to. I dreamed about the boy\u2019s fox skittering down Oneida with ten tails and a beating tile and people stepping back to make room without looking up from their bags. I dreamed about Eloise\u2019s hair at rest. I dreamed about a mirror that did not need to show me both to make me believe we could be two and one without smudging. In the morning the marble felt light in my pocket, the way things feel when they have taken their own advice and rested. I brewed tea that tasted like the season had remembered cinnamon by accident. I opened the shop. I stitched a hem for a girl getting married at the church that wants to pretend it dislikes me. I soldered a lamp that had belonged to a grandfather who did like me. I labeled a jar evidence of a boundary you kept. I waited for the next thing to need both of us, and when it came\u2014because it always comes\u2014I put on the coat without apology and I did not look away when the heat smiled.",

Flyers sprouted on telephone poles with words like thermal recovery and energy from waste and artist's rendering in which a building with no right angles glowed benevolently while a family of four held hands and did not cough. A man in a jacket so close to navy it made him vanish if he stood too near the police chief introduced himself to Eloise in the hallway outside the council chamber and said things like public-private partnership and pilot facility and then said my name like we had been introduced in a room I had accidentally missed. He had a smile that could pick a lock and an eye for a camera that didn\u2019t need a lens. His card said Morrison & Kent, Regional Development. The card was heavy in a way that asked to be kept as a coaster.\n\nEloise slid the card across my counter with two fingers like she was returning a knife to a drawer. \u201cHe\u2019s got a stack of policy white papers taller than his ego,\u201d she said, which on a different day might have been funny. \u201cHe says he likes the tiles. He says there\u2019s a way to scale them that involves concrete and fencing and a smokestack we can rename a flute if we want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do want to rename things,\u201d I said, and flipped the card like a coin and let it land face down because I am childish when it comes to fate. \u201cI don\u2019t want a flute that only plays one note and calls it a symphony.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wants to meet,\u201d she said, glancing at the door as if the bell might tell on her. \u201cHe wants to shake your hand. He wants to learn the word Retort and file it under local color.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring the coat,\u201d I said. \u201cIf he puts a match on my counter I\u2019m going to make him stand on a tile until he decides whether ash is something he respects.\u201d\n\nAunt Sable sat me down with coffee that had been on the burner long enough to develop opinions and told me the one story I had never let her tell properly. It came slowed by age and sped by impatience. My mother loved a dock more than a pew because a dock never pretended it could hold what it couldn\u2019t. She loved my father because he wore the same face whether he was watching a storm or a stove. She hated the car because it made leaving too easy. She kept the tin because it made staying a task, not a default. The night the river took the car, it took everything that had been kept between them like towels. It returned rotten fish and a hubcap and a story that the town folded into itself the way a person folds a letter before they throw it out and then retrieves it, smooths it, and decides to keep it a little longer. \u201cYour mother could have become a ruin,\u201d Sable said, watching the steam from her cup as if it might deliver a verdict. \u201cShe chose not to. She chose work. She chose, sometimes, to burn small things before they could become bonfires. She messed that up as often as she succeeded, because we are messy people. She did not tell me about the tin because she knew I would hide at least one of the pieces someplace I would later forget.\u201d\n\nI wanted to be angry with my mother for trusting a river with her note when I was twelve and so hungry for stories that weren\u2019t about loss, and I wanted not to be because the note had reached my hands like it had walked there. I wanted to be angry with Sable for not telling me sooner about the nights she had sat up with my mother counting the seconds between thunder and lightning and deciding when to move furniture away from windows. I wanted not to be, because she had chosen to be the kind of woman I could call when my other self said three nights. It is exhausting to want the fair versions of people and to keep choosing the real ones anyway.\n\nMorrison from Morrison & Kent had the decency to call me June and the indecency to take in my shop like it was a stage set. He saw the jars and the coat with his eyes and the Retort with his pupils. He spoke in paragraphs that have killed more towns than storms, verbs that make nouns do labor they didn\u2019t sign up for. \u201cWe see an opportunity to integrate community-based solutions,\u201d he said, which translated to: your mess is an aesthetic we can monetize. \u201cWe see an opportunity to localize control within a regional footprint,\u201d which meant: we will put a fence around your air and sell it back to you with a bow. He admired the tile the way you admire something a child has made before you usher it to the refrigerator, smile, and go back to the real conversation. He touched the green and didn\u2019t notice the way it thrummed because he doesn\u2019t live with his hands.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll call it a kiln so we think pottery,\u201d I said. \u201cYou\u2019ll call it cogeneration so we think winter sweaters and not smoke.\u201d I poured tea because I am the kind of witch who believes hospitality is a spell strong enough to make men talk true. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me innovative so I think I\u2019m important and then you\u2019ll file me under color and call my name if there\u2019s a ribbon to cut.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe prefer the term energy hub,\u201d he said cheerfully. \u201cImagine the message. No more fires in alleys. No more confusion. We collect, we process, we capture. You keep your tiles. We keep your city\u2019s air clean. The grant money likes us. The state likes numbers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe river doesn\u2019t like fences,\u201d I said, because there is always a point at which you have to line up your allegiances out loud. \u201cAnd neither do I. Capturing breath is not the same as denying it. I will not build you a pretty chimney.\u201d\n\nHe did what men like him do when faced with women like me: he smiled like our dance had been charming and announced he would see me at the town hall meeting. He left a brochure that smelled like ink and confidence and I used it to level a stool that has always leaned just enough to make you feel alert.\n\nDelia Mott took the brochure and wrote Not a flute, a pipe snake on the cover in pencil so light you had to squint. She stood in my doorway, which had become a threshold for women bringing me unsentimental truth, and told me she had colleagues who liked Morrison\u2019s hair and colleagues who liked my jars and some who liked both and none who liked the river when it got opinionated. \u201cYou\u2019ll need numbers that don\u2019t blush,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ll need a demonstration that doesn\u2019t smell like babies will later cough. They\u2019re going to bring a stack of tires to the meeting and call it hypothetically, and you\u2019re going to keep your face from changing when someone says dioxin and looks at you like they\u2019re asking whether you\u2019d like a second cookie.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can hold a straight face,\u201d I said. \u201cI have made hems on prom dresses so poorly conceived they were in violation of a building code and I did not lecture once.\u201d\n\nShe almost smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll bring a meter. You bring your patience. We\u2019ll let the town decide which smoke it likes living with.\u201d\n\nThe boy from Thirteenth sat cross-legged on my floor with the fox and told me he had a name he wasn\u2019t born with and would like me to use. \u201cRook,\u201d he said, and making the k made his mouth pleased. \u201cLike the bird and like the game, but mostly like the bird. The bird likes trash. The bird knows how to look at it different.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook,\u201d I repeated, and let it settle in my mouth as if it were a seed that had chosen me. He laced wire into the fox\u2019s shoulder while he talked about a woman with bracelets who had asked for a dolphin again and he had said, \u201cNo ma\u2019am, I don\u2019t do mammals,\u201d and then felt bad and offered her a fish that looked like a knife. I gave him a cuff I had lined with gold and he put it on like a royal and then pretended not to feel taller.\n\nWe set the date for the town hall and I spent the morning making sure the Retort did not have a grudge about being asked to perform. The coat hung on its hook like a person listening for their name under noise. I cut more tiles than I needed and not enough for what I wanted. I wrote a list in the way my mother taught me to write lists\u2014verbs first, then nouns, then people\u2014and tried not to read it as a spell. I wrote: bring jars, bring Delia, bring patience, bring stitching for when men say machines and mean women, bring tea. I did not write bring the other me because she is not a thing I set out anymore; she is a weather that arrives when addressed and when ignored both. I put the tin with the key in the drawer under the register where I keep the money and the candy I pretend I don\u2019t like. I told it to behave. It didn\u2019t answer, which is how you know you\u2019re dealing with an heirloom and not a demon.\n\nThe town hall was held in the old gym because it is the only room that can hold our collective self-importance. The bleachers creaked under people who do not believe in bleachers. Eloise had her pen out like a wand and her hair tacked back like a decision. Pastor Lennox had ceded the front row to Etta, who had brought a string bag with two oranges in it and two small stones that I knew were intended to be thrown only if someone said witch in a way that made it unignorable. Morrison & Kent had set up a banner with a logo that was attempting to be a wave and a lightning bolt and instead looked like a checkmark stretched wrong. Rook stood by the door with the fox, because we had agreed it should come to meetings like a dog you trust not to bite even if someone deserves it.\n\nWe had rehearsed without saying we had rehearsed. Nate had loaned us the small roll-off and the ugly duct. Delia had brought a meter that made grown men look like they were considering a proposal. I had stacked the tiles within reach like arguments I would only use if provoked. The firefighters hung at the back in posture that said we will not be recruited and then, under it, a posture that said we might, because we prefer work to talk.\n\nMorrison spoke in the generous lower register men save for good wine and civic pride. He had slides full of arrows, and arrows are always lying. He had numbers that made smoke look like the kind of cloud you nap on. He said partnership to mean control and resilience to mean purchase order. He said Ms. Weaver twice in a tone that had respect wrapped around condescension like pastry around a cheap sausage. He gestured at the Retort like he had introduced us to each other and we had been grateful.\n\nI did not interrupt him because the only thing worse than a man with good hair is a woman who lets him have an easy villain. When it was my turn, I did not look at the cameras. I looked where Gideon had planted himself, one hand on the railing because he does not like burning in rooms. I spoke the way you speak to a river when you are unsure whether it is asleep or only pretending. I said we built this with hands you know. I said we are already capturing what you cannot make not burn. I said you can come to the lean-to and put your own breath on the glass and watch it fog and clear. I said my name. I did not say witch. I did not say no to the plant. I said we will not be eaten by our solution.\n\nWe lit the Retort. The ducting hummed forward like a horse that had learned the command in another language but trusted the hand. The jars fogged and cleared in that steady measure that has become my favorite rhythm. The heat went where it was supposed to because we had laid the story ahead of it like a track. Delia watched the meter the way musicians watch a conductor they don\u2019t fully like but have agreed to obey. She held up a finger when someone in a hat shouted about toxins, then displayed a line on a screen that refused to move into panic. Morrison smiled in a way that said, charming, but asked for comparison. His men brought a barrel and a stack of what they called farm film: plastic that has seen hay and sun and a litany of hungers. They asked if we would mind. Eloise said go ahead, and her voice had a wire in it.\n\nThey lit the barrel the wrong way on purpose, and if you think that sentence isn\u2019t a spell then you haven\u2019t lived in a town where men create their own villains for sport. The fire took gleeful umbrage. It produced the particular cough of heat that is half chemical, half affront. Delia\u2019s meter began to show its numbers. People leaned back into their coats and into their opinions. I felt the coat on the hook unlatch itself, which is a trick I don\u2019t recommend allowing unless you know for a fact you can carry both yourself and your other without dropping your tea.\n\nShe stepped into me without theatrics because the gym doesn\u2019t like them unless there\u2019s a band. We put our hand\u2014the one with the mark\u2014on the duct and the Retort took the yowl from the barrel the way a grandmother takes a toddler who has decided a tantrum is the only way to tell the truth. The jars experimented with blowing their tops and then remembered themselves. The fire made a last bid for romance and writhed. I watched the room feel the difference between spectacle and function. If you are lucky in your life, you get to perform that reveal twice: once for a town, once for yourself. I breathed in for the sake of the meter and out for the sake of my lungs.\n\nMorrison did not get hotter, which is the problem with men like him. He stayed even and smiled like he had made this happen. He asked about scale and costs and the inevitability of waste and whether I had considered licensing. He offered to help with permitting for a larger hood and a friendlier word for capture. He suggested a ribbon-cutting in spring. He said he would send over a team to evaluate. Only once did he slip and say incineration, and then he corrected to thermal reclamation with the grace of a dancer who never lets you see the turn.\n\nAfter, in the shuffle that follows demonstrations and before the fights reassert themselves, a man with the kind of face you find on high school photographs in cases in hallways asked me for a tile for his mother. He whispered that she can\u2019t breathe in summer and he can carry a square better than a machine, and I handed him one with my mother\u2019s name under my breath because sometimes prayers are logistics. The firefighters came and asked for cuffs and did not bother to pretend they were being charitable. Pastor Lennox put his hand on the Retort like a man laying hands on a congregant who has confessed something heavy and wants the weight redistributed, not removed. Eloise spoke quietly to Delia in a language of numbers and favors. Rook slipped the fox through the legs of men who did not look down and smiled when no one tripped.\n\nI saw him, then. The he from the woman with the sunburn and the errands and the confession she had practically stapled to my counter. He had a mustache that belonged to a different mouth and a jacket poor men buy when they decide to look rich once and never again. He stayed at the edges of the crowd where people who collect allies stand. He laughed when Morrison talked about jobs and nodded when the barrel complained and looked bored when we made the Retort hum. He caught my eye and didn\u2019t drop it. He was not the man who cut the fence; he was the man who tells that man when to arrive and with what tools. In a country song he\u2019d be the one who drives the truck to the line and leaves it idling.\n\nHe left before I could decide if I was going to tell him my name and ask for his, and I let him. Chasing men like that is a way to forget why you built anything. Aunt Sable says you can lose a decade in one pair of eyes that make you feel like you are a version of yourself that would be fun at dinner.\n\nThat night, after the gym had been returned to a room for sweating without stakes and the Retort was asleep enough to count as resting and the tile stack was three squares taller than exhaustion, she and I stood in the kitchen with the mirror face-up like a thinned lake. The coat hung a little lower because wet air makes even magic heavier. I did what I had been practicing doing without rehearsing: I held both our gazes at once and did not flinch at the overlay. \u201cI want a braid,\u201d I said, which on paper looks romantic and in practice sounds like two women deciding about bone.\n\n\u201cYou want to make a schedule,\u201d she said, because our humor sits on the same stubborn shelf. \u201cYou want Tuesdays you and Thursdays me. You want me to punch a clock. You want to be able to blame me when you say yes to more fire than you can digest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to not wake up with sugar on my teeth and the triangle on my brick,\u201d I said. \u201cI want to be able to say to my aunt that I am done outsourcing my scorch. I want to stand in the alley with the coat on and feel you decide to stay in my hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen stop pretending I am only your badness,\u201d she said, and there it was; the particular nasty of truth that loves me enough to tell me I am a coward. \u201cYou call me when you want speed and you call me when you want courage and you call me when a man says he knows better what to do with heat and you want to look frightening while you defy him. It would be sweet if it weren\u2019t lazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will learn to look frightening with a needle,\u201d I said, and laughed at myself because I already do.\n\nWe braided without string. We braided with breath. We braided with the sound of the Retort cooling and the distant plop of something large in the river deciding to surface then changing its mind because even fish are ambivalent sometimes. I took a strand of hair and burned it in the flame of a candle we had made with leftover paraffin and beeswax I bought from a man on a back road who carves saints out of stumps and never learned to charge appropriately. She took a bit of ash and traced a line on my wrist. I took the key from my neck and pressed it to the mirror until it fogged and cleared, and she held the mirror steady in case I shook. When we were done, we looked like the same woman to anybody who would photograph us for the newspaper. Inside, a door clicked. A small one. The kind people use when they pretend they are not leaving or entering. We stood there for a whole minute and breathed. I do not know yet whether it will hold forever or until spring. That is honest. That is the best I can give you when you ask for permanence in a town where almost everything floats.\n\nTwo days later, because I had made a braid and the world wanted to tug it to see if it would hold, the plastic cult\u2014which really is only three people and a Facebook page and a penchant for drawing triangles on picnic tables while waiting for their fries\u2014announced a parade. They called it Crackle Walk and designed a logo with a match sticking up like a flag from a trash can. They said they would bring their bags and their beliefs and their lighters and their right to air, and they met in the parking lot of the shuttered video store where nostalgia knows how to make itself look like policy. I put on the coat and did not bring the Retort because there is no arguing with spectacle except by not feeding it.\n\nRook came because he had made signs for the teenagers who wanted to walk but not admit they were walking for anything other than an excuse not to do homework. Etta came because she does not know how to stay home when a town is making a choice in public. Pastor Lennox came because he insists on testifying with his face even when his voice isn\u2019t asked for. Gideon came because he had a suspicion that someone would attempt to make a fire on or near a vehicle. Delia did not come because she would be accused of taking a side and she is not embarrassed to tell me she sometimes sits in her truck and eats a sandwich while the town burns or learns. Eloise came because she comes to everything she can possibly come to, and when she cannot, she sends a woman who is shorter and angrier.\n\nThey had a barrel. Of course they had a barrel. They had three. They had triangles painted in a stencil style that I now recognized like the handwriting of a boy who has copied a phrase until he has convinced himself he invented it. They had slogans that would be more fun if they didn\u2019t sound like boys putting their hands in the air at the back of class because making noise is a way to make sure you don\u2019t have to listen. They had a man in the jacket who will never be rich, calling phrases like freedom and choice and witch but on our side now, which is the irony I\u2019m not sure the universe will ever get tired of.\n\nI walked up and held a tile like a communion and the way the teenagers looked at me made the inside of my elbow hurt. \u201cPick one,\u201d I said. \u201cStand on it. Light your barrel. See if you like the way the air feels when your toes are telling the truth.\u201d Two of them did it because two is the correct number for this town. The third boy made a loud speech about lies and marbles and the river probably being a gimmick and then his lighter failed because sometimes God is a cheap Bic. The tile under their feet hummed and they looked down like they had just learned that floor is a verb.\n\nOne of the triangle-men\u2014the ones with mustaches they grew as if the seventies had been a country they were patriotic for\u2014stepped up to me with a match he\u2019d been rolling between his fingers in a way that indicated both habit and desire for attention. He held it so close to my coat that I smelled the sulfur in the moment before the flare and my braid tightened like a girl flexing her hands. The coat took the heat and held it and cooled it and I did not move, again not out of bravery, out of stubbornness. I pressed the tile into his chest, and he took it because it was either that or admit he didn\u2019t know what to do with his hands. \u201cStand on that,\u201d I said, and he did, because even men who dislike witchcraft like instructions when everyone is watching.\n\nThe barrels burned small because we didn\u2019t give them oxygen to be dramatic. The tiles brightened. The breath fogged the not-jar of the air and then, because physics agrees to be reasonable in public sometimes, lifted. The men with the triangles ran out of slogans and stood with their hands out, waiting to be told what to do next. Eloise told them to pick up their cigarette butts. Etta told them to take off their hats if they were coming into the co-op for chili. Pastor Lennox told them nothing because he had decided to take my hint about the silence that works as well as any sermon. Rook ran the fox through the barrel smoke and laughed when it didn\u2019t cough.\n\nThat night the river did its trick with the moon. It doesn\u2019t reverse unless the wind force-feeds it the lake, but it can look like it has decided to. It wore a skin that made me want to step into it for the sheer meanness of its calm. I took the key out of the tin and went to the Nestl\u00e9 wall and considered the locks this town has that are worth opening and the ones that need to stay stuck because getting through them would only let out things that can\u2019t be taught manners. I chalked a small box on the brick and made a mark and another, then pressed the key into the mortar like you teach a word to a child by putting it on their tongue. The brick accepted and then rejected me politely, the way some women do when you are trying to get them to let you escort them and they have never needed the arm you are offering. I laughed because there is a kind of prayer that looks exactly like a witch giggling alone in an alley.\n\nGideon found me there and did not pretend he had been out to buy milk. He had the look he gets when he sees the river carrying a promise only he will notice because the rest of us are busy with land. \u201cYou ever going to put a tile on the boat?\u201d he asked, casual in the way of men who are not casual about anything. \u201cMight be I don\u2019t want to be the only thing that breathes right on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll put one under the pump,\u201d I said. \u201cI\u2019ll put one where your foot goes when you pull a thing from the water and you don\u2019t want your right knee to tell you cruel stories for three days after.\u201d\n\nHe nodded as if that had been the right answer and then, like a man admitting something to a woman he sees too clearly to manipulate, said, \u201cI sat on my porch last night and I thought about your father. I thought about the way he laughed in the bar like someone had told him a joke so close to true it made him generous. I thought about the miles of water between where that car first decided to be a fish and where we found it. I thought about how heavy things become not because of their metal but because of the place they live. I thought about your mother\u2019s handwriting. I thought, if I had a daughter, would I let her read it. I don\u2019t know what the good answer is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe good answer is that you don\u2019t get to decide what she reads,\u201d I said, and laughed into my scarf so the words came back warm. \u201cYou get to decide whether you hand it to her or the river does. The river is worse at timing. Sometimes she is perfect in spite of herself.\u201d\n\nWe walked back up Oneida with tiles tucked under our coats like contraband and the sky doing that winter thing where it pretends it will snow if we all wish hard enough. I put one tile on the library steps before I unlocked my door because I want the air in there to be kind to the children who think the stacks are a forest and the roof is the sky. I put one in the foyer of my building where Mrs. Calabrese has started peeking and pretending she approves. I put one under the table where I work so the breath I chain to glass has a reason to stay. I wrote a word on the mirror I had never let myself write because it felt like a confession that might dissolve under heat. Home, I wrote, and waited for it to fog and clear, and it did both.\n\nWhen Morrison called the next morning, he did not apologize. He did not congratulate. He asked if he could send his team to measure and photograph and advise. I told him to bring coffee and gloves and to come ready to sand duct edges so nobody lost a knuckle. He did not laugh. He said a time. I said the door would be unlocked. Then I called Delia and told her to park across the street with her meter and a face so unamused the sun would move over one block rather than shine right on us. I called Eloise and told her to bring the kind of pen that bleeds through paper because we would need to sign things that don\u2019t let us out easy. I told Rook to stay home because I did not want to explain to corporate men why the fox had better posture than their boss. I told Aunt Sable nothing because it is good to give an old woman a morning where she is not required to remind a younger one to not catch fire unnecessarily.\n\nThey came with hard hats and shoes none of us would wear to do work you plan to sweat in. They came with their own words for duct and flange and heat and none of those words included blessing and patience. I made them tea with honey from the man on the back road and let them sit on my stools, which are the kind of stools that make you tell the truth because they wobble if you lie. They measured my mouth. They clicked their tongues at my jars. They took photographs of the coat as if it were an antique that had wandered down from a museum storeroom and gotten ideas. One of them, a woman with earrings shaped like letters, asked me how I stitched the lining and I told her with a story and a little bit of science. She did not roll her eyes. A man named Nick braced a sheet of steel while Nate drilled and the bit screamed and nobody yelled witch even once. It was progress in a way that felt like a tile curing, slow, then quick, then sudden and obvious.\n\nAfter their visit, Morrison stood at my door with his hands in his coat like a boy who hasn\u2019t learned where to put them when he wants to ask to be let in. He said all the things polite people say when they have failed to win a round and are trying not to show their discomfort with not being beloved. He started to ask me something and then swallowed it, which is either manners or strategy and I am not always good at telling the difference. He settled on, \u201cDo you ever wish you were just a tailor,\u201d and I told him, \u201cI wish a lot of things,\u201d and then I told him a thing my mother wrote in a note I did not invite him to see: that fire and water are not enemies, that people use enemies when they are lazy. He nodded like he understood and then went away like he did not.\n\nThat night, because the world enjoys testing knots when your hands are chapped and you only want to go to bed, the wind decided to come down Oneida with its shoulders. The bags on porches sang their ugly little songs. The bins clattered and grew hungry. Somewhere, a boy with a lighter and an empty had an idea. Somewhere else, a woman looked up at the ceiling and wondered if it was worth moving the couch. I locked my door, then unlocked it, then put my hand on the Retort like a person telling their dog it is time to go out. She was already standing. The coat slid from the hook and didn\u2019t bother to pretend it needed me. We went to the alley. We breathed. We waited. We made our mouths agreeable to the kind of smoke this town refuses to admit it likes, and then we turned that liking into tile, into floor, into a sentence we will stand on until our knees give out and we are replaced by a woman who knows how to thread a needle and convince heat that the better story is the one where it behaves.",

                              "content": "Chapter Ten hid its face behind a sheet-metal sky and let the town find its breath in the seam between freeze and thaw that makes buildings cough. The river went flat as a lie told too often and then rucked up without warning, and I understood we were in that part of winter where decisions get made by people who think weather is a conversation partner. I woke with my mouth tasting like solder and tea, not sugar, which meant the braid was holding. She hovered at the edge of my hand the way cats hover at the edge of affection, and when I reached for a pin my fingers knew which self was better at picking a sliver from cloth and which was better at holding steady while heat argued. The tiles under the counter kept their hum like a choir with sense, not ambition. Outside, the street wore a crust of salt and disappointment and the little birds did their frantic hop-growl-hop dance in the gutter like what they wanted was entirely reasonable and the world just needed to get out of their way.\n\nEloise stopped by first, not because she likes mornings but because she had been up all night reading a stack of documents taller than the fern she has kept alive in her office by threatening it. She had Morrison\u2019s card bent into a tool for opening stubborn jars and a look that told me her hair had won. \u201cThey want an MOU,\u201d she said without ceremony, as though I were a person who keeps my initials in a drawer ready to be affixed to something ornamental and then regretted. \u201cThey want to call it a pilot, but it smells like permanence with addenda. They want language about compliance and they want us to say thank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can say thank you without meaning it,\u201d I offered, pouring coffee into a cup that had been chipped back when my mother thought she was going to move to a city where women wear lipstick to the post office. \u201cI cannot say incinerator with a smile. I can say Retort so many times it becomes a lullaby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to accept their money,\u201d she said with the lighter kind of despair that comes when you are lying to yourself for strategic reasons. \u201cWe could do it with grants and a bake sale and my retirement. Don\u2019t make a face. I\u2019m only half joking. I don\u2019t want to sell our breath to a man who calls smoke an opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut the tile on your desk,\u201d I said, because sometimes you give your friends work that looks like superstition and they will do it if they love you enough. \u201cStand on it when you read. It will keep you honest with yourself about which part of your mouth is speaking.\u201d\n\nShe stood. She did as I asked. She closed her eyes, which in Eloise is a prayer. When she opened them again she had that pinched look like a woman who has decided to carry something heavy to the top of a hill out of spite. \u201cThere\u2019s a hearing in Albany,\u201d she said. \u201cDelia wants you. Morrison wants you. Your aunt wants you to stay home and boil bones for broth because she knows travel eats you. I want you to come and be useful and to also be small. I hate that those are the choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know how to be small,\u201d I said. \u201cI learned it early. I prefer loud when loud is a tool, but I can be folded and put in a bag like a sweater if it gets us past the door.\u201d\n\nAfter she left I made a floor where there had been one, only now it had an opinion. I set three tiles in the threshold and grouted them with slurry and patience. They looked like a lake you could bring inside without getting the rugs in trouble. I made a sign on a piece of slate that used to be a menu in a caf\u00e9 that sold feeling instead of food: Step however you like, it said. Notice the difference. People came in and did. Old men from the barbershop hopped like children then pretended they hadn\u2019t. A girl with a backpack set too heavy for her bones stepped on the green and got weepy in the way you do when you\u2019ve been holding your breath for longer than a minute and someone says you don\u2019t have to. Rook came in with the fox and made it bow to the square politely, which set the tone.\n\nRook\u2019s fox had become a kind of maypole without the ringing and the fights. Children tied ribbons around the tails and some of the knots were so bad they held, because that is true of children and true of towns. He had given the creature small iron feet scavenged from a chair and the tile-heart sat just behind a piece of clear plastic that used to be the lid for a cake nobody enjoyed and everyone ate anyway. The fox did not look alive, but it looked like it had no patience for lying about its condition, and I loved it for that. Rook had started a club without saying club, and a handful of kids with cold hands and eyes too alert for their age came by after school with bags full of plastics cleaned with effort. He told them their hands mattered more than their finds and they believed him because he said it as if he expected them to argue and win.\n\nPastor Lennox came in with his tie pin misaligned and no pamphlets, which told me he had fought and perhaps lost in a room that smelled like coffee and winter boots. He put his hands on the counter the way a man puts his hands on a piano he was punished for loving when he was twelve. \u201cThe board,\u201d he said, by which he meant the five people in his church who wear responsibility like perfume, \u201care divided. They want the regional plant because the brochure has a picture of a sunset on it. They want your tiles because their grandchildren sleep better after a day with one underfoot. They want me to tell them what stewardship is, and I want to tell them it is sorting shame into the right bag and putting love in the clear bin and taking the rest to the river once a month and asking the water to tell you when you are lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can tell them we capture breath,\u201d I said, because some phrases can be loaned without losing their magic. \u201cYou can tell them I will tile your aisle if they let me, and we will see if the pews complain. You can tell them the plant wants a fence. I want a floor.\u201d\n\nHe smiled without heat and it meant more than a fervent grin would have. \u201cIf I say floor from the pulpit, Lennox & Sons will accuse me of witchcraft by way of interior design,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say ground. I will say footing. I will say we do not know how to behave with our feet. I will ask them to practice.\u201d\n\nHe left me a small bag of cash from a funeral luncheon because grief tips well and sometimes has nowhere else to put its hands. He promised me nothing and that is why I trusted him.\n\nThe he who had taught a woman to ruin her kettle the fast way sent me a message through a boy whose ears I would like to protect from a decade when men confide laziness to the nearest youth with good posture. It was a note on paper torn from a legal pad, carefully folded, the kind a man\u2019s hand does when it wants to pretend to be a gentleman. The meeting place was the old tannery; the hour was the kind that breaks a neck. Aunt Sable told me not to go in the tone she saves for when she knows I will and would like the points on her warning recorded. I wore the coat and no perfume. I told Eloise by text and she wrote back three skulls and a thumbs-up and a time she would start calling people with keys if I did not answer my phone. Gideon watched me walk by and did not stop me because he believes in me in a way that is not flattering and is entirely useful.\n\nThe tannery still exhaled ghosts of hides and labor when it got warm enough indoors for old air to remember its vows. This was not one of those nights. The frost on the windows looked like breath that had curled around a lead paint warning and decided to make art of it. He was there with two others, men with hands softer than their talk. They had jackets that had learned the smell of garages and slogans that had not learned to be ashamed of themselves yet. They did not say the word cult because men in this town only use that word for women, never for the rooms where they bring fire and a sense of grievance like it is a hand tool.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to burn the whole town,\u201d he said, which is the kind of sentence that makes you check for an exit even if you have magic. \u201cWe want to use what\u2019s there. We want to be in charge of the heat. We want to show the city it can\u2019t police everything with guilt. You have a mouth,\u201d he added, glancing at my coat in a way that made me check which part of me was the dangerous one. \u201cWe have hands. We could make something bigger than jars and tiles. We could make something tragic to be righteous about.\u201d\n\nI have learned how to be courteous when I am furious because women who live in small towns need to be good at survival on a dozen registers. \u201cYou want fires with witnesses,\u201d I said. \u201cYou want a river that will take credit for your mess. You want me at the front of your parade so when the police take pictures you can say we\u2019re in it together and you are an ally to a woman who burns.\u201d\n\nHe smiled like he had been told it looked good on him once and had never stopped. \u201cYou set it up and we\u2019ll make sure you have protection.\u201d\n\n\u201cProtection,\u201d I repeated, as if I had never met the word and wanted to know its preferred pronouns. \u201cFrom who?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom us,\u201d he said, and that made me laugh in a way I am not proud of. There are laughs that keep you alive and they are cruel laughs, and you try not to grow fond of them because they turn on you when you are tired.\n\nI did not bring Delia or Nate to the tannery; I brought them to the night after. I left the tannery with my hands by my sides and my back itching in the way backs itch when men you would not invite to dinner stare and try to make you into an epiphany. In my pocket the key from my mother\u2019s tin pressed a bruise into my thigh so deep I could have chalked it and called it a map. The next day Delia and I stood in the street and watched the traffic like two sisters who had decided to go for a walk in front of a battlefield. \u201cThey\u2019ll try the Retort,\u201d Delia said, adjusting her meter like a woman adjusting a necklace given by an ex she still wears because it looks better on her than on any apology. \u201cSabotage is exciting. They are bored.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we use law?\u201d I asked, because sometimes I like to fantasize about a system that will look down and notice our breath without us having to paint it green.\n\n\u201cWe use rope and we use neighbors and we use a camera and we use boredom against them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe let them be as dull as they are in public and then we do not give them the spice of outrage. Believe me, I hate it. I prefer lawsuits. But lawsuits are winter. They take and take and you only see the green in the spring.\u201d\n\nThey came late, thinking the darkness could be their mother. Nate and Gideon were visible and useful; I was not. I sat in the sewing chair inside with the mirror flat and the coat swung over the back like a woman tired of standing. She did not need to come but she did, because we have agreed that sometimes the theater is necessary. The men tried the door and found it latched with a thing Morrison\u2019s men would call a device and Nate calls a good decision. One climbed, as if he thought vertigo had a crush on him. He met mine instead; the window had a tile in it and the tile sang when his glove hit the frame, and he found his grip disagreeing with him because devotion to art will get in your bones if you hold it often enough. They gave up on subtlety and went for the can, and the can failed because Gideon had replaced it with water because he enjoys a joke when it is useful. They ran. We did not. Delia took photographs with a camera that is also a witness because it records numbers in the language a court likes. Nate said a sentence in a dialect made entirely of swear words and conjugations of to fix and then went home and kissed his wife and did not tell her anything.\n\nEveryone pretended not to know what had happened. That is mercy and also a bad habit. Eloise took the photographs and slid them into a folder that will only be opened if we need leverage, and leverage is one of those words I have learned to use without grimacing. The men with the stencils learned where the camera was on the light pole by my alley and drew their triangles a block away. The cracks of their symbol went shallow and the chalk wore quicker because somewhere a boy with a sleeve that can take scrubbing had decided his corner should be clean. I do not count these as victories. I count them as pauses in the kind of weather that tires you.\n\nThe blizzard came a week later, a real one, not a tantrum. It arrived overnight with the confidence of a guest who knows the spare key is under the frog on the porch. The lake gave the town its shoulder and the town bent like a woman who has learned how to carry without asking for help. The power had the decency to wait until morning to fail, and then it failed with the seriousness we expect of it. Etta\u2019s kitchen went dark and she finished the soup on a camping stove that had boiled water for arguments and reconciliations in its time. The co-op went dim and people breathed on the glass where the good bread hides and pretended that fog was a plan. The church opened its doors because that is what churches like his do even when the board wants to say something about liability. The transfer station closed and sighed in relief because the bales hate damp.\n\nI opened my door and the Retort breathed like a dragon who has agreed to be of service. The coat warmed the air in a way that made my teeth feel like they are a part of my face and not an argument. We did not burn plastic to heat people because I would like to keep being invited to parties. We burned pallets cut down to apology and scrap from a woodshop where a woman knows how to plane without swearing. We captured what needed capturing and let heat do what heat does when it is loved correctly. People came and stood on the tiles and stood near the duct and crushed their hands in their pockets and told each other stories about winters that made this one look like a kind child and then ate Etta\u2019s soup because kindness is a sedative.\n\nPastor Lennox brought blankets from the church that smelled like the cedar chest they think is a chapel. Eloise sat on a stool and fell asleep in a posture she would have fired someone for having in a meeting. Gideon stationed himself near the door like a bouncer for weather. Rook set the fox under the coat\u2019s hem in a way that made it look like an altar boy being trained to be useful and not get caught up in his own metaphor. Aunt Sable came in late with a casserole that contains at least three recipes and opinion, and she touched my face as if confirming a rumor of fever. \u201cYou keep your scalp covered when you go out,\u201d she said, which was not a request and therefore got obeyed. \u201cYou let other people put wood on your altar and do not fuss about how they stack it. This is the kind of night where pride pretends to be a coat and fails to keep you warm.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of the afternoon a boy pounded on the door with urgency that made the coat tighten. He had the particular white of a face that has met cold past polite and has the will to demand warmth from a half-sleeping town. Gideon was out the door before he finished his sentence, which was two words: he fell. The river did not look like a sentence you could read that day; it looked like grammar that had given up. I followed with the coat and a rope because you cannot stop a woman who has braided with a part of herself that knows ice better than it knows meetings. Pastor came with his hands ready to be useful and his shoulders ready to be scolded by anyone with a badge. Etta did not come because she knows that kitchens need guarding just as much as banks.\n\nThe bank behind the old factory has been trying to become a person for years. It was raw and mean and honest. Gideon had gone ahead to the point where he had thrown ropes a hundred times; he threw again and they skated in the wind like insults that refuse to land. The hole in the ice was not large. It was the size of a yes when the wrong person asks. A hat floated near the edge and that was everything. Rook, who had followed against orders I had not given and therefore could not be said to have disobeyed, put the fox down on the bank and the fox\u2019s tile glowed obediently. The light was not much. It was enough. The boy on the ice hung to a lip with a determination I recognized in my own hands when they refuse to drop a stitch. He did not call for help. He conserved.\n\nI lay flat and slid. The coat hissed at the cold but did not scold. She and I breathed like we were trying to persuade the air to remember kindness. Behind me the rope paid out with a grunt from Pastor and a curse from Aunt Sable that rolled over the river\u2019s rudeness like a quilt. Gideon worked the far shore near a tree that has opinions about men who lean on it. \u201cLeft,\u201d he called, because there are nights when language collapses to degree and distance. I went left. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, and there it was, the slick lip where the boy\u2019s hands had decided to be blasphemers and not let go. I reached and the coat did that thing it does when it remembers it was stitched for this and not for photographs. Heat took the immediate frost and sent it away from the place we stood. I took his wrist. I did not say hold on because he already was. I did not say don\u2019t be afraid because fear was the coat he was wearing and it was keeping him alive.\n\nWe pulled. Rook braced his feet on a branch and leaned like he had been born with rope in his family. The Pastor did not pray because he had his hands full. Gideon did not swear because he felt the presence of women. The boy\u2019s elbow slipped and then caught and his mouth opened for a scream that did not arrive because his breath belonged to the river for a second and then to me. We got him out, elbows, knees, hips, laughter that sounded like the underside of ice. We slid him onto a tile we had brought without admitting we had brought it, and the hum sent a message to his bones: you are not going to die of this. It was a lie and a promise, which is what all good spells are.\n\nWe took him back to the Retort and resented the way the air forgot it had been cruel ten minutes ago. We stripped him without dignity because dignity is a summer sport. We wrapped him in the coat because coats exist for boys more than for witches. We fed him sugar that has never once saved anyone and saves everyone. He cried for his mother and then didn\u2019t because Etta came and scolded him for drips on her floor and then kissed his ear. The Pastor knelt in the corner and did not make it about God. Rook adjusted the fox\u2019s tail and I decided that if anyone tried to make him take it offstage I would place the tile in their lap and see if their legs learned respect.\n\nThe storm blew out and left behind that silvery light that makes the town look like a photograph of itself. People went home boastful and shook and I put the coat back on its hook and told it to stop preening. We slept without dreams because the body has a sense of humor and chooses rest at the absurd times and panic at parties. When I woke, the Retort had cooled enough to tick like a grandfather clock and the tiles looked like squares where an entire town had stood patiently and listened to their own versions of themselves.\n\nThe key from my mother\u2019s tin itched in my pocket like an idea that doesn\u2019t want to be caught. It had not been the lock at the Nestl\u00e9 wall. It did not belong to any door in my shop or to storage under the stairs or to the bookcase with the secret we will all pretend not to know for decades. It wanted a throat. It wanted a particular metal sound. I went to the mill\u2019s underbelly, where the old vents still pretend they are essential. The tunnels smell like iron and adolescent kisses. I put the key to a grate and it shrugged. I put it to a panel that once had a safety sermon on it and it sighed as if remembering. The fourth try was a small innocuous box over a corridor so cold my nostrils threatened to become architecture. The key fit like a pronoun that finally makes sense. Inside was not treasure because treasure would be vulgar. It was paper. It was a rolled plan with clean lines and a date from before my mother decided to have the version of me who likes to embroider feelings onto objects. It was a drawing of a flue and a retort older than any living man in this town by twenty years. It was a way to climb into the old chimney and make it eat correctly.\n\nNate took one look and said this is stupid and then another look and said let us. He has a love for old systems the way some men love horses or their first wives. He and a girl from the college who wears boots like she owns terrain and uses words like laminar with affection ran their fingers along the map like loved ones at a grave. Gideon fetched a chain that has pulled up four cars and three lies. Delia stood with her device and her pencil and told us where the air would try to cheat. We fitted the old brick to our mouth the way I fit old hems to new fabric. I kissed my mother\u2019s initials scratched in the tin on the corner of my counter because I have given up on pretending there isn\u2019t a river between me and any good decision I make.\n\nWhen we lit the old stack it coughed like a baritone woken at noon and then cleared its throat and took the breath the way you want a body to take a breath when it has been told it can relax. The draw was easy. The jars showed their data without blushing. The heat held where it should and the coat did not have to be a hero. The town came and stood and did not applaud because this was not a show; it was a day at work. Rook put his ear to the brick and declared the chimney was telling jokes about how it had not expected to be useful again and that it would not be satisfied until someone worked a dance into its shadow. The Pastor took off his hat in the wind and did not chase it and the hat hit the brick and stopped and he looked at me as if the wall had done him a favor.\n\nMorrison came because he has good instincts for victory he can photograph himself near. He put a hand on the old brick and the brick did not warm for him because it is old enough to know the difference between affection and a r\u00e9sum\u00e9. He asked about scale, which is always their question, and I told him to ask me about pace instead. He offered money again and Eloise took his card again and then brought it to my shop and stuck it under a wobbly leg without smiling. Delia wrote an email with numbers as polite as she gets. The firefighters came to see if they could be spared eyebrow trauma, and I gave them cuffs and Rook told them the fox is not designed to ride in a truck and they pretended to be offended.\n\nWe laid the first run of tile along the river on a day the wind couldn\u2019t make up its mind. It was a patch, not a road, the opposite of a ribbon cutting because only babies and fools cut ribbons that are doing their best to hold something together. Children stepped and shouted and did the thing where they take four hops and then need to tell a story about a bird. Women carrying groceries stood for one extra minute and then another and the bags left their red-purple bites in their fingers and they did not mind. Gideon put a square in his boat with the seriousness he usually reserves for his hat. Etta brought bread and put it straight on the tile for warmth and committed five sins I will never scold her for. Aunt Sable chalked a word on the edge where the next square will go and she did not let me see it until the chalk had failed to brush off with a sleeve.\n\nThat night the mirror did not wait for me to stand in front of it. It brightened the way mirrors do when a woman finally lights a candle instead of pretending the dark is not dark. She stood with me and we did not say our names because we both know them and that is not what naming is for. \u201cYou stitched the river to the floor,\u201d she observed, generous in the way that makes me wonder what we will do next that will require forgiveness. \u201cYou made a chimney behave without shame. You kept a boy from dying and you forced a plant to admit it does not need a fence to be safe.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had help,\u201d I said, and it was not false modesty. I have never in my life done anything of value that didn\u2019t run through other hands like light through a window.\n\n\u201cKeep liking that part,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep asking for rope. Keep making little mouths that don\u2019t scare the city. Do not get good at spectacle. It eats you.\u201d\n\nI wrote a word on the mirror with the fat of my thumb. Keep, I wrote, and the glass fogged and cleared and kept it. I wrote a second word under it because I am greedy and because there is no other point to being a woman who can convince heat to behave. Breathe, I wrote, and the mirror did. We went to bed not early and not late and the coat hung and did not whisper. The Retort cooled with the smug contentment of a thing that has been asked to do a job it was built for. The river moved like a thought I would remember in the morning. The wind bit my eaves and was forgiven.\n\nIn the middle of the night my phone hummed with the politeness of a man who has learned how to wake you without making you hate him. It was Gideon, and he was not at the river and he was not apologizing. \u201cThe car,\u201d he said in a voice that had placed itself on the map and chosen not to move. \u201cAnother. Not old. Not ours. Out by the bend near the flats. I can get it if you want to know who decided to let go. I can leave it if you want to sleep.\u201d\n\nI pulled the quilt up to my chin and let myself lie, because I am learning to leave some things to other people who are good at grief. \u201cGet it,\u201d I said. \u201cTell me in the morning whether the river wants to punish or forgive. Tell me if the key fits another box. Tell me if I need to get out of bed.\u201d\n\nHe made a sound that men make when they are grateful women did not ask their night to be bent. \u201cSleep,\u201d he said. \u201cDream of floors.\u201d\n\nI did not dream of floors. I dreamed of hats, ridiculous hats, the kind made out of plastic snow that men wear to stay human in a storm. I dreamed of making them into tiles and then into a roof and then into a deck and then throwing the deck a party and not inviting the men. I dreamed of Morrison learning to hold a wrench and of Delia teaching a class called The Physics of Being Reasonable. I dreamed of Aunt Sable in a dress of anchors and nails. I dreamed of Rook building a creature with no tail at all that ran on insults turned into power. I dreamed of Pastor Lennox standing on a tile and saying the word floor without anyone in his congregation thinking it was a code for witch. I dreamed of my mother writing another note and tucking it under a tile at the river, and I dreamed of letting it stay.\n\nIn the morning, the air had that feel of a town that has been behaving itself and would like a treat. I made toast and didn\u2019t judge it for not being better. The tile at my feet hummed with the satisfaction of a tool that had gotten the joke. The coat watched me butter my bread with the suspicion of a garment that fears butter and the long slow creep of everyday. We would get the day anyway. We would get Morrison and the men with triangles turned into squares and the paperwork and the part where people ask if the Jar Lava is safe in a voice that cones the word witch into a new field. We would get a boy coming in with a bag full of bottle caps he had washed with care because he had learned care remains even when you have a mouth for heat. We would get a woman asking if a tile could sit on the sill of her father\u2019s room where he coughs and we would say yes and mean it. We would get Gideon\u2019s call and it would be bad and not unusual. We would get all of it. And the river, rude and spare and patient, would go on making its case for not being anyone\u2019s metaphor. It would let us stand on its breath. It would keep our breath trapped in squares on floors we had the nerve to call beautiful. It would be winter for a while yet, and then it would not be, and we would keep, and we would breathe.",
