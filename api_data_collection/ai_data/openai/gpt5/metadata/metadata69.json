     "novel_text": "On the morning the monkeys learned how to make a siren out of a traffic cone, Ephraim Cole counted twenty-seven of them on the tram. The driver didn\u2019t stop them; the driver never stopped them anymore. A capuchin with a bandaged ear dangled from the rubber strap above Ephraim\u2019s head and spit a single sunflower seed onto the calculus text of a high school girl. The capuchin kept one eye on Ephraim\u2019s briefcase. They all did that now, like the case might open and exhale a roast chicken or a grenade.\n\n\u201cMorning, pen-chewer,\u201d the bandaged one said, voice like a pipe scraped by a wire. He had learned Ephraim\u2019s face two months ago, after the audit board forced the City to publish the monkey tickets and fines; it was still strange to be famous to the wrong species.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Ephraim said, because he never could carve a new habit for himself. Courtesy had calcified around him into a shape like a second skin, the shape of a compliant man in a tilted city.\n\n\u201cDrop that box,\u201d the monkey said, then laughed and clapped at its own joke like a cymbalist. \u201cYou drop it, we catch it, you cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t drop it,\u201d Ephraim said. The girl with the calculus text lifted her book and wiped the sunflower seed away. The driver let the tram sigh through an intersection where four macaques in orange construction vests waved plastic paddles and made obscene faces at the buses. One of the vest monkeys had a whistle; he alternated between a regulation no-noise and a ululated wolf-cry that made the pigeons on the wires throw themselves into the morning like a blanket tossed off a bed.\n\nEphraim was forty-seven years old, unmarried, with a mortgage he despised and a sister who still loved him in a way that flummoxed him. He kept his hair short because monkeys pulled hair when they were angry. He had a precise face, a precise way of walking, and a precise belief that numbers were bones and we could look through them to see the body that had walked there before. He worked at Kettle & Hart, a firm known for making the ungovernable governable until the monkeys moved in and declared governance a snack.\n\nAs the tram eased into St. Alabaster\u2019s Square, a troop of vervets jogged alongside, their tails flying like banners. One\u2014smaller, with a burn scar like a coin on its shoulder\u2014threw a handful of gravel at the windows. \u201cAudit this!\u201d the small one shouted, and then, in falsetto, \u201cWe appreciate your service!\u201d The others cackled and slapped one another\u2019s back as if applause could be traded. The bandaged capuchin tugged at the strap until the rubber groaned.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d it said. \u201cYou\u2019re late, numbers, numbers, numbers. Where\u2019s your tail? I have one.\u201d It twitched its little hook to demonstrate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not late,\u201d Ephraim said, although he was ten minutes behind, and he hated himself for the need to correct the statement. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t chew pens.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? You chew little boys?\u201d Another cymbal-clap. A murmur from the humans in the car. Ephraim\u2019s briefcase weighed a mile. The capuchin stuck its tongue out, pale and repulsive and weirdly human at the edges. \u201cLittle boy uncle. Uncle eats, uncle eats.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d the girl with the textbook said. Her voice had that end-of-argument tone certain teenagers carry like an extra rib. \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re art,\u201d the monkey said, and slid back out the open window as the tram doors peeled open. It was gone into the chrome and sun and diesel.\n\nOn the platform, a troupe of monkeys had stacked crates and were attempting to stand on each other\u2019s shoulders to reach a banner that read MONKEYS FOR SENSEFUL STREETS. The sign had been paid for by the Chamber of Commerce as a friendly show of support. Last week\u2019s Chamber president resigned with a rash. The crates trembled. A rhesus monkey at the bottom groaned and barfed onto the pavement. The one above him laughed, poked the vomit with a pencil, and wrote something obscene with it that looked, somehow, a little like Ephraim\u2019s name.\n\nFamiliar gooseflesh climbed Ephraim\u2019s arms as he considered turning back for home, for the toasted rye he had left on the counter and the dome of quiet around his apartment above the bakery. But he had an appointment. And also\u2014though he hardly said it even to himself\u2014it felt like quitting when people were watching. He kept moving, kept his briefcase tucked under his elbow like a heart he didn\u2019t want to hand back.\n\nKettle & Hart occupied the tenth and eleventh floors of the Gray Tower, although \u201coccupied\u201d was inaccurate: somewhere between city policy and monkey preference, the tenth floor had become a playground. No one could think why. The monkeys didn\u2019t work there; they didn\u2019t sleep there. They only hung from the fluorescent light fixtures and yowled in tight harmonies that made interns cry. They dipped their paws in the fish tank and threw guppies at the arrow plants. Someone had brought a swing\u2014someone had affixed the swing to the load-bearing crossbeam. It creaked. The building inspectors signaled a complaint, but the complaint was caught and chewed on by a gang of spider monkeys who ate vowels like potato chips.\n\n\u201cMorning, Mr. Cole,\u201d said Darla, the receptionist, as he stepped off the elevator into the lobby on eleven. She was dressed in a blouse the color of clean money, the exact tint of cash that hadn\u2019t thought about itself enough to be dirty.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he said. He glanced at the glass\u2014monkeys\u2019 faces were smeared into the lobby windows like thumbprints on a mirror. One made a heart with its hands when he looked. Another threw a rock.\n\nDarla slid him a folder across the counter. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s office called. Your methods are \u2018too revealing\u2019? They\u2019d like you to use fewer colors.\u201d Her mouth didn\u2019t change shape as she said it.\n\nHe opened the folder. Inside there was a memo with the City seal and the subheading Suggestions for Softer Accounting. He had invented those color graphs because they were the only way to make the river of money look like a river. He had been told repeatedly that citizens liked rivers; rivers were calming. His graphs showed the City\u2019s main channels and the tributaries: a blue torrent down the middle, a green stream for parks, a brown trickle that oozed toward rat control. And off to one side, a new canal that had opened in October, labeled Public Simian Integration Fund. It was a bright yellow that flickered as if someone had set the room on fire.\n\n\u201cFewer colors,\u201d Ephraim said. He looked up. \u201cWe\u2019re bleeding yellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to say that,\u201d Darla said. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to say anything that sounds like that.\u201d She leaned closer. A monkey pressed its face to the glass, cheeks flat, breath spooling a fog. \u201cYou remember you\u2019re having lunch with Miriam and Rory.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I forget,\u201d he said, and instantly felt the guilt that followed repeated tenderness. He liked lunch with his sister. He liked the way his nephew stole the olives. He liked the way the olives looked, too\u2014little green eyeballs in their dish, wet and ridiculous.\n\nHe made it to his office with only one interruption, a small troop of monkeys who had discovered his door and had written on it in grease pencil: FRIED ACCOUNTANT. They had drawn a crude pan. He wiped the drawing away with the sleeve of his jacket and made a mental note to stop making mental notes. It was exhausting to owe himself so much.\n\nHe loved his office still: the parquet floor stared back at him with quiet pattern; the books smelled like paper instead of panic. He opened his laptop and typed his password: abacus462!\u2014a gentle insult to himself\u2014and the spreadsheet bloomed like a forewarned flower.\n\nSix months of figures. Ticketing revenue down. Banana import tax up. Gasoline spent on chases involving motorcycle-riding macaques: up, up, uP. A curious line item from the Department of Cultural Affairs called Interprimatic Reparations: ongoing. He drilled into it. Contractor names. A nonprofit named Bright Bridges run out of an address that didn\u2019t exist: 999 Cherry Road. A series of five payments to something called Uncle\u2019s Tithe Fund. He made a fist in the air like a conductor with no orchestra. He breathed. He looked. The column said the payments had been listed not as expenses but as swaps. Assets for assets. City for time.\n\nHe called up the PDF of the original agreement that had been signed in that televised ceremony in the courthouse rotunda, the one where a female mandrill in a satin jacket had licked the microphone and the mayor had laughed like a man falling through a glass table. Reconciliation Accord, the document said. He typed a search for \u201ctithe.\u201d Nothing. But the ledger kept the unsayable like a smuggled spoon.\n\n\u201cCole,\u201d said a voice from his doorway. He turned. Mr. Hart himself leaned there like a rakish uncle in a play, a tie dangling, a grin that had browned like a banana. He was a good man in the way that a boat can be good in a storm and useless in dock.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Ephraim said.\n\n\u201cColor trouble,\u201d Hart said, and whistled through his teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t soften for them. Not yet.\u201d He stepped into the office, hip bumped a plant, didn\u2019t notice. \u201cGoing to the museum tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountinghouse Museum? Lark\u2019s talk. \u2018Numerics in the Age of Primate Civility.\u2019 He\u2019s going to say something he shouldn\u2019t. He hinted. He can\u2019t stop hinting, that man. I figure someone has to clap loudly.\u201d Hart peered at the screen. He hummed a C. \u201cUncle\u2019s Tithe Fund. That\u2019s new.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen everything,\u201d Hart said, then spread his hands. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to see this. There\u2019s a rumor the monkeys want to make the uncle the new father.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHart inclined his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense, Cole. You\u2019re right. This whole thing is cross-eyed. But\u2014\u201d He stopped, glanced out the glass wall toward the monkeys who had found their reflections and were making love to them. \u201cEverything makes sense to someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that someone,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cI don\u2019t like that he\u2019s in my spreadsheet.\u201d\n\nHart laughed. \u201cLunch with Miriam?\u201d He had a way of asking questions he already knew the answers to that made you forgive him for asking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Ephraim said.\n\n\u201cGood. Eat good food. It might get scarce when the scooters run out of gas.\u201d Hart\u2019s face twitched. \u201cIf the monkeys start siphoning fuel, it\u2019s all over.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need fuel,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cThey need an audience.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen,\u201d Hart said. He clapped him on the shoulder and left a faint hair on his sleeve. Ephraim plucked it off as if it might deliver a surprise stinger.\n\nHe worked an hour. He took notes. He made a small chart with fewer colors\u2014a grayscale puddle that told the truth with a whisper. He printed it and slid it into a manila folder and wrote in block letters: TRUTH BUT QUIET. He shut his laptop. He touched his forehead to the cool glass and watched a juvenile monkey investigate a stapler like a bomb. The city had felt like this before, he thought, once long ago when he had been a boy and his mother had taught him to add his change at the grocery store. That was the day he\u2019d realized that sometimes the numbers came up wrong because someone had taken something. He had been seven; he had cried. His mother had looked around and said, \u201cShh. Not so loud. There are other kinds of wrong to worry about.\u201d\n\nAt twenty to twelve he walked to Caf\u00e9 Hav, where the tables on the sidewalk had been fitted with spring-loaded lids to discourage theft. The lids did nothing but make the compliments louder when they worked. Miriam was already there, hair tucked into a scarf, hands wrapped around a glass of water like it was a small animal she meant to teach a trick. He loved her forehead most: the wide plain of it, the place where she stored her thoughts. Her son\u2014his nephew\u2014Rory\u2014sat opposite, chin in hand, the other hand flicking through videos on his phone. He had dyed his hair a shade of blue that wasn\u2019t a color but a refusal. He looked up, saw Ephraim, and managed a smile that felt like an eclipse: a bright circle borrowed from the dark.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Miriam said, and then kissed his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve ordered olives. We have a window of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore what?\u201d Ephraim asked.\n\n\u201cBefore they remember they like them,\u201d she said. She nodded toward a pair of monkeys crouching on the fire escape above, smoking cigarettes they had stolen from the bus depot. The cigarettes made them cough; the coughing made them laugh. Everything that hurt made them louder.\n\n\u201cHi, Uncle E,\u201d Rory said. \u201cI took a video of a gibbon putting Mayor Henley\u2019s hat in a urinal. It\u2019s art.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like them,\u201d Ephraim said, and immediately regretted it.\n\n\u201cNot like them,\u201d Rory said softly. He flicked through his phone. \u201cThey\u2019re dirty poets.\u201d He lifted the device so Ephraim could see: there was the mayor, face spanked with sweat, looking up as a long-limbed gray creature lowered the hat into a bowl that had not been cleaned since the last three parades.\n\n\u201cThey learned it from us,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cThey learn everything from us. That\u2019s the problem\u2014it\u2019s all a mirror. I just wish the mirror was clean.\u201d\n\nEphraim sat. The waiter brought olives, a plate of fried anchovies, and bread with a rind like a crusted planet. They ate first\u2014always eat first, Miriam had taught him\u2014because conversation could be stolen but food could only be taken from you one bite at a time, and that took time.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s school,\u201d he asked Rory, so he could pretend the world was normal. \u201cAny good teachers.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Lark is my favorite,\u201d Rory said.\n\n\u201cThe museum one?\u201d Ephraim asked.\n\n\u201cAdjunct,\u201d Rory said with the sadness of someone who had learned too soon how words could make a ladder and also a cage. \u201cHe\u2019s teaching a class on Counting Rituals. He says before we wrote numbers we had to eat a number.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat a number,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cI love that nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense,\u201d Rory said, and looked at Ephraim for allyhood. \u201cHe says you can\u2019t hold a thing you don\u2019t recognize. You have to put it in your mouth to know it. Infants. Tribes. Banks.\u201d He tore a piece of bread and ate it, eyes closed. \u201cHe says there was a ceremony, very old, where the man who kept the ledger, to inoculate the village against loss, had to\u2014\u201d He stopped, looked at his mother, and then said quickly, \u201cIt\u2019s a silly story.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell it,\u201d Miriam said, mouth full.\n\n\u201cHe had to eat his kin,\u201d Rory said.\n\nEphraim\u2019s fork paused midair. He set it down. \u201cWhich kin.\u201d\n\n\u201cNephew,\u201d Rory said. He didn\u2019t smile. He didn\u2019t look up. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid. It was a metaphor. Mr. Lark loves metaphors. He\u2019s like a metaphor with tenure.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdjuncts don\u2019t have tenure,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cAlso don\u2019t say nephew. It tastes strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt tasted strange in class too,\u201d Rory said, and then he looked at his uncle, really looked, as if looking was a new thing one might try between mouthfuls of fish. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cIt\u2019s a story. We have a stack of them. The monkeys like to climb them.\u201d\n\nRory laughed. Miriam rolled an olive across the table to him. He caught it with a hand he didn\u2019t know he trusted yet. Ephraim felt something cold drift through him like a cloud across a field, a shadow with a square edge. He drank water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your job to fix the city,\u201d Miriam said later, when they were waiting for coffee. \u201cYou hear me? We all have two hands. If you spend both on the wheel, you don\u2019t have any left to drink your coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s a tithe,\u201d he said, because the word had been rattling around his ribs since he\u2019d seen it. \u201cIn the records. An Uncle\u2019s Tithe.\u201d\n\nMiriam\u2019s eyes narrowed. She was good at narrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s a knot I don\u2019t want to pick. Let\u2019s eat our pastries.\u201d\n\nThey did. The coffee was a little bitter, in the way things are bitter when you want them to be sweet. A young macaque across the street tried to steal the salt shaker from the table of an elderly man; when the old man moved to block, the macaque bit his knuckle and then put its hand to its mouth and made exaggerated gagging faces as if he had fed it poison. Two other monkeys imitated the gag. They laughed. The old man stared at his hand like it had turned into a piece of the moon. He stowed it in his lap and would not take it out again.\n\nEphraim walked back to the office through a gaggle of them. One looked at his shoes and said, \u201cNice feet, uncle.\u201d Another threw him a puck of chewed gum, pink and wet. The world smelled like exhaust and old fruit. He missed the smell of snow, the way it had used to smell when he was young and the world had stopped for a minute and then started again with good intentions.\n\nWhen he sat again, he\u2019d been gone two hours. Two new messages: one from the mayor\u2019s assistant, explaining how color had feelings; one from the Countinghouse Museum, a bland invitation to Lark\u2019s talk with a line at the bottom that had been pasted in crooked: bring a friend or bring none. We are happy with your choice. The font was wrong. When he printed it, the letters flickered as if heat were rising off them.\n\nAt five he went. He told Darla he\u2019d bring her back a pin from the museum shop. She told him to bring her back a piece of good news, and then made the sign against the evil eye her grandmother had given her for free. The monkeys followed him for six blocks, hooting and making little kissing sounds, and then peeled off at the intersection where an ice cream truck had learned that playing calliope music would now be answered with rocks.\n\nCountinghouse stood with its back to the river, a square building with a frieze of coins around the top. The glass doors were scummed with monkey prints. Inside, the guards had been given whistles, and when a macaque tried to slide in on a local boy\u2019s heels, the guards blew so hard their cheeks fluttered like flags. The macaque laughed and mimed blowing into an invisible whistle until a third guard kissed him on the head, which somehow worked and the macaque left.\n\n\u201cMr. Cole,\u201d said a voice. Professor Lark materialized like a thesis from behind a column. Thin as a line, hair that had lost interest in obeying gravity, a tie printed with little numbers at play. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the tram. It\u2019s a chorus these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had sardines for lunch,\u201d Ephraim said, a bit too quickly. \u201cWhat\u2019s a tithe.\u201d\n\nLark blinked. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say hello.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said it in my heart. What\u2019s a tithe.\u201d\n\nLark\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cA little bit of sacrifice formalized into the ledger so that you can look at it without bleeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you bleed and then you record it,\u201d Ephraim said.\n\n\u201cYou record it and therefore you can bleed,\u201d Lark said, not unkindly. \u201cCome inside. I will tell you something during the Q&A that will make three donors leave. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\nThey stood through Lark\u2019s talk with fifty other citizens\u2014fewer than before, Ephraim noted, although more than an English department reading. The monkey presence was there, too: small furry shapes on rafters, a hand dipping into a purse, a whispered slur like a draught in winter. Lark spoke about the earliest tallies, about knotted cords and burnt marks on bone. He showed an image of a ledger from a village nobody wanted to admit they came from, a book that had been kept under a floorboard in a hut that had been moved from the valley to a living room to a display.\n\n\u201cThe book doesn\u2019t say it,\u201d Lark said, and the lights deepened around his body. \u201cThe book doesn\u2019t write the part that makes you sick. The book keeps you from throwing up. It says grain. It says wheat. It says goats. It says winter. It says aunt. It says tree. It says nephew.\u201d He paused. He was dramatic. He didn\u2019t need props. \u201cBut the elders did not do what we do with the nephew. They didn\u2019t make him a scholarship. They didn\u2019t give him to marriage. They\u2014\u201d His mouth did a little grieving thing. He shook his head.\n\nSomeone in the back said, as a joke, \u201cThey ate him,\u201d and the room rippled. You could almost see the ripple, like heat.\n\nLark swallowed. \u201cIt was not a feast,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a counting. It was not cruelty, in the sense that a cat is cruel to a bird. It was algebra. A thing you hope not to have to do again.\u201d\n\nA monkey from the rafters blew him a kiss and then made a rude suggestion with its finger. Lark bowed toward it, still scholarly. \u201cThe world bears the marks of our arithmetic,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the sums go mad, the animals correct us.\u201d His eyes found Ephraim\u2019s like a pin into a butterfly. \u201cWe thought we could live without a ledger. But we cannot live without the person who holds the ledger.\u201d\n\nOn his way down the museum steps, someone pressed a paper into Ephraim\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t see the face. The paper crackled like something that had been dried on a radiator. He stuck it into his jacket pocket because his first instinct, after being handed something he didn\u2019t understand, was not to understand it yet. He walked along the river. He looked down into the water and thought of tongues. If you put a number into your mouth, would you learn it? If you put a world?\n\nWhen he got home\u2014climb the stairs, key stuck in a stubborn lock, the smell of baking sunk into the wood like forgiveness\u2014he took the paper out and unfolded it and saw seven lines of writing in a hand so careful it could have been a mask.\n\nEphraim Cole. You are the appointed. You will do the killing that saves. The monkeys will jeer. The people will weep. The balance will tilt back away from the bright snow. Eat the boy you love. Eat him before the Harvest Moon. Or all of us will be eaten by the final winter. Please do it clean.\n\nHe sat. He put the paper on the table and put a glass of water on top of it as if it might float away. He went to the sink and washed his hands. He washed them until the monkeys outside began to bang on the fire escape and chant, in a nursery rhythm that had kept him company for the last two months: \u201cUncle\u2019s belly, uncle\u2019s belly, yum yum yum.\u201d\n\nSomeone, he thought, was playing with him. He had always been easy to play with; he had had the wrong face for ignoring.\n\nHe tore the note in half and then into quarters and then into something like lint. He opened the window and saw the troop on the fire escape. They wore curtains like capes; one smoked a cigarette with the wrong end in its mouth and acted out choking for the others who applauded. \u201cBoo,\u201d said the smallest. \u201cBoo uncle.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d he said, so mild, so mild it made him angry. He shut the window.\n\nHe slept badly. Dreams like spreadsheets, cells\u2019 edges cutting into him. He woke at three and there it was again, the idea, the bright and awful clear idea like a sign on a bridge: this is where the road ends. It was stupid, it was offensive, it was impossible. It was also very simple. He hated simple. People used simple like a weapon.\n\nAt six, without coffee, he walked the three blocks to Miriam\u2019s. The street was nearly quiet; only a few monkeys out, the early ones, smoking and spitting, scratching their bellies, tossing glass bottles in soft underhand arcs at shop doors. Miriam\u2019s building was patched brick with a climbing vine that the monkeys had used to practice tying knots. He rang. He waited. He rang again. He could hear the radio inside, a voice that read the news with healthy confusion. He could feel the city stretching and then going stiff again in the cold.\n\n\u201cEph?\u201d Miriam\u2019s voice at the door crack, and then the chain; then her face, hair messy, robe tied in a knot like a coin. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI brought pastries. From the shop below my place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a devil,\u201d she said. \u201cRory\u2019s asleep. He came home late from a screening. Something called A Poem Made of Garbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d he said, and he had, Rory had told him, and he hadn\u2019t understood. You could see a poem and not understand it. You could eat one and fail to taste it. He had done both.\n\nHe sat in their kitchen, which had a table he had swaggered into their life with, a table he had rescued from the curb when a contractor had gone bankrupt and had left furniture in the street like a trail of bones. He liked the table because it could hold weight without telling you about it. Miriam poured coffee. They ate the pastries. The ones with cream had been flattened by the bag; cream oozed slightly out and they used their finger to wipe it up. He thought about tongues again. He thought about numbers. He thought about the way his throat closed.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the sound of bad news,\u201d Miriam asked, and because they were siblings he said, \u201cShoes,\u201d and they both laughed. That was what their mother had said the year the factory shut down, when the neighbors filled their SUVs with things they had worked on for half their lives. \u201cBad news sounds like shoes.\u201d The clatter on the steps, the clatter backwards.\n\n\u201cI have a note,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t know he was going to say it until it stood in the air between them. \u201cIn my pocket. Someone left it at the museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I want to hear it,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also you do.\u201d He left the part out about how he had ripped it, and the part about how ripping had done nothing to it. He told her what it said. He told her the words like they had been written on a blackboard behind his eyes. He told her slowly, like the person you love is a fire that you can burn if you go too quickly.\n\nMiriam pressed her thumb hard into the table. He saw the whitish oval where the blood moved away. She was quiet a long time. The radio talked about the monkeys. The radio talked about a ward in the south where a troop had taken over the elementary school and had refused to let the children leave until they had taught the monkeys how to spell filth. The radio used the word unfortunate. The radio said, \u201cAuthorities are urging calm,\u201d and then a loud crash, as someone threw something at the radio.\n\n\u201cI hate this story,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cIf you told me a different one, I would follow you into it. I would. I would wear whatever costume you told me to. But I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. Two hundred years ago people did a lot of dirty things and they called it math. The world doesn\u2019t ask you to be a knife.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like the world does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has the tone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we, then,\u201d she asked, \u201cif not the ones who tilt back? If not the ones who refuse to look at a boy and see an answer.\u201d\n\nHe rubbed his face. He wanted to leave so he could stop hurting her with himself. He wanted to stay so whatever came would come while he was there to stand in front of it with his hair and his body and his poor math.\n\nFrom Rory\u2019s room came a crash. Then a curse. Then silence. Ephraim stood before Miriam could. He had a key to the hallway lock; he didn\u2019t knock. He walked in like family walks in: with his hand up as if a room can be covered like a bird.\n\nRory sat cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by the spilled guts of his backpack: a camera, two notebooks, a banana with a bite out of it and then another bite out of the peel. He looked up, startled, then laughed, then saw his mother behind Ephraim and reconfigured his face. Ephraim wanted to call the face \u201chonest,\u201d but it was more complicated than that. It was what you put on when you knew the world wanted to suck on your skin.\n\n\u201cWhat broke,\u201d Miriam asked. Her voice had gone into the tone she saved for nurses and that one uncle who drank the Christmas cards.\n\n\u201cThe little tripod,\u201d Rory said. \u201cIt was cheap. I bought it with my own money. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll use books instead.\u201d He stacked some books. They were about film and about old cities and about how to make a home out of a place that bites.\n\nEphraim kneeled and set the tripod up and clicked it. It clicked. \u201cA screw,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a break.\u201d He turned the screw with his thumbnail until it obeyed. He wanted to fix everything with thumbnails and not with old words. He wanted to be allowed to do that.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Rory said. He looked at him as if the thanks were a way to put a coin in a machine. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d he asked, surprising both of them. \u201cYou look like math.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am math,\u201d Ephraim said, because it was easier than saying the other thing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go. I\u2019ll send you that grant link, okay?\u201d\n\nRory\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will apply. But don\u2019t give me a ladder that goes into the wrong house.\u201d\n\nOn the way out, Miriam put her hand on Ephraim\u2019s wrist. \u201cWe make our own sums,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do. No one gets to tell us who is food.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d he said. The words floated like balloons; he tied them to his chair in his mind. \u201cI agree.\u201d\n\nHe went to work. He stared at his screen until seven. He solved for x and then for y. He solved for z and then he solved for a little boy with blue hair and a camera and a mother who was not wrong. He did not find a solution that did not put blood in the margins. The monkeys on the other side of the glass had taken to hitting their heads on the window in a steady rhythm. Someone had given them helmets. He did not decide anything because deciding would change the world and he was not ready to end the world yet. The world liked to decide itself.\n\nOn the tram home, the bandaged capuchin winked at him and made a motion like cutting a steak. \u201cYou do it yet?\u201d it asked.\n\n\u201cDo what,\u201d Ephraim said. His mouth was dry. He didn\u2019t like its interest. He didn\u2019t like the way news traveled in fur.\n\n\u201cDinner,\u201d the monkey said. \u201cThe city is hungry. Your stomach is a balcony.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop talking,\u201d said the girl with the calculus book, and the monkey hopped away, offended but pleased with its own offended. The tram sang that song metal sings when it\u2019s tired. The driver didn\u2019t stop at the hospital even when a woman in the aisle clutched her belly and made a sound like a zipper breaking. They said the hospitals were full of monkeys. They said monkeys cradled babies and did not drop them. They said many things. Ephraim had learned, in the last six months, to write the words they say in his notebook and put a box beside them and leave it unchecked.\n\nHe got home at nine. The bakery downstairs had closed. The scent of sugar lingered like a rumor. He leaned against the door and thought about the moment before a storm when the air feels like a wet map, the moment where all the roads lead into the center and also away. He closed his eyes. He saw the word nephew. He saw it without letters. He saw it as a shape: a small shape with too much gravity, a shape that makes everything bend.\n\nHe opened his eyes. There was a second note under the door. He did not move. He watched it as if you could make a letter go away by not touching it. His heart did something he didn\u2019t approve of. He bent finally, because that is what men who hold ledgers do, they bend and they lift and they add. He opened the note. He did not breathe while he opened it, as if oxygen were a vote.\n\nIt said: Do not share this with anyone. Do not. There is a timeline and we are already late. The monkeys are rehearsal. The bright snow is real. We will all die in it. Eat him, Ephraim. You said you would once. Once you said, If the world asked me, I would. The world is asking. It has written it on its cheek in lipstick. Do the small cruelty to prevent the large. Do the close harm to save the far.\n\nNo signature. A smear of something at the bottom that looked like ash but smelled like sugar.\n\nHe went to the window. Outside, a troop had stolen a car and were taking turns honking the horn while one sat on the roof and made a speech about freedom that was only curse words and two big ideas. A policeman stood on the corner and watched and smoked and didn\u2019t call it in. A stranger walked past with a guitar case and did not open it. The world had learned how to keep its secrets in plain sight.\n\nHe slept on the couch because the bed was haunted by decision. He woke at two to a sound that sounded like monkeys singing a lullaby and a man screaming his own name. He thought about the bright snow\u2014ash, he supposed, an event where burning went wrong\u2014and he looked at the ceiling and tried to make himself into the kind of person who could lift a fork with the wrong thing on it. He failed. He fell asleep imagining he had hung his conscience out the window like laundry, and the monkeys had stolen it, and were throwing it like a frisbee from one building to the other, and he was laughing in a way he never laughed.\n\nDays snowed into one another like paperwork left outside. Lark sent him an email with a link to an article about ancient accountants with knives. Darla told him that a monkey had broken into the copy room and eaten a ream of paper with a relish that had made the interns almost love it. Hart canceled a meeting and rescheduled it and canceled it again. The mayor was on television saying that a little anarchy was just the price of life. Miriam texted him a picture of Rory asleep, face half turned, the blue hair like a lake in winter. He stared at the picture for a long time. He hit the heart. He put the phone on the table and did not pick it up again for a while.\n\nThen the first fire came. It was small and stupid. A macaque playing with a bottle of rubbing alcohol in a barber shop. A match, a flare, a whoop. The hair-curled smoke. The barbers went outside. The monkeys clapped. Someone threw a bucket of water that was not enough. The newspaper ran a picture that was almost beautiful, and in the corner of the picture, a man who looked like Ephraim watched a ceiling tile fall, and you could see his hand had lifted slightly, as if a reflex might catch a burning square of artificial sky, as if catching were a promise. The caption read: Barber Fire One of Many Small Incidents. The paper liked to end sentences with a verb. It told you nothing was finished.\n\nAt Kettle & Hart, Ephraim\u2019s spreadsheet grew a new column: costs of burns, costs of smoke, costs of night. He colored it black. He sent it to the mayor. The mayor\u2019s assistant wrote back a string of emojis the meaning of which was: send fewer graphs and also die.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Lark came into his office without knocking and shut the door and cried. He cried with his whole body, like he had been holding something an hour too long. Ephraim stood up and did the thing most people would do, which is put a hand tentatively on someone else\u2019s back and then leave their hand there, a hand as placeholder for all the things you cannot do.\n\n\u201cThey told me,\u201d Lark said into the crook of his elbow. \u201cThere is an item. A budget. There\u2019s a date. It\u2019s printed. Someone printed it. If you print it, it becomes real. You know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the item,\u201d Ephraim asked, though he knew the tune.\n\n\u201cUncle\u2019s Tithe,\u201d Lark said. \u201cIt\u2019s not metaphor anymore. It\u2019s an appointment.\u201d He laughed, a broken cup sound. \u201cThey wrote in the cost: none.\u201d He looked up. His face was wet without shame. \u201cAre we the kind of people who let an appointment keep itself?\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cApparently we are walking toward it like a dentist appointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could refuse,\u201d Lark said. \u201cYou could. You could go on television. You could be arrested. It\u2019s a kind of math. You could put yourself in prison instead. If they take you, they can\u2019t make you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat feels like a small math,\u201d Ephraim said, though he didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t know anything larger. \u201cIt feels like a math where you save your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is already gone,\u201d Lark said. \u201cThe monkeys say it wrong on purpose. People clap.\u201d He swiped his face dry. He pressed his hands to the top of Ephraim\u2019s desk. \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t be the ledger they want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be,\u201d Ephraim said, and saw that that sentence meant nothing.\n\nHe walked home in a wind that had learned new directions. The sky had a color like cold meat. He stopped beneath a traffic light where a macaque in a baseball cap was pretending to be a police officer and waving cars through red lights. A man in a van blew through and a taxi struck him and the monkeys laughed until one of them fell off the streetlight and sprained its wrist and then they laughed again. No one came. A woman on the corner shouted at nobody that she was leaving, that she would leave now, then stopped shouting and sat on a box like sitting was a death she could manage.\n\nAt his door there was a third note. He did not have to read it to hear it. He put it in the drawer with the other fragments. He made himself an omelet with too much salt. He could not bring himself to eat it. He ate a piece of toast instead. He threw the omelet away and felt like a criminal. If everything ends, he thought, it will end like this: the trash full of good eggs, the monkeys on the fire escape howling little hymns. He went to sleep in his bed because the couch had learned his fear and was feeding it back to him.\n\nHe dreamed that he was in a room with a long table and numbers in chairs. Each number had a napkin tucked into its collar. The number 7 turned to him and said, \u201cWe eat to live,\u201d and the number 1 lifted a knife, and a 0 rolled itself to the door like a tire trying to escape.\n\nIn the morning he had decided not to decide until he had to. He wrote himself a note: procrastination is sometimes compassion. He taped it above his kettle. He went to work. The monkeys had taken the copy machine apart. They handed out pieces to passersby: a spring for you, a little glass for you, a broken tray for the old woman with the hat that looked like a chicken. Darla made a sound under her breath and then smiled. \u201cWe have no copier,\u201d she said, as if confession were a new way to be clean.\n\nAt noon he went to the bathroom and splashed water on his face. He stared into the mirror. Behind him, a monkey was on the sink, pushing the soap dispenser like it was a casino lever. \u201cIt\u2019s coming,\u201d the monkey said cheerfully, in a voice it ought not to have had. \u201cIt\u2019s on the calendar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ephraim said.\n\n\u201cBig dinner,\u201d the monkey said. \u201cDessert? No. Boo. Eat first. Don\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease stop,\u201d Ephraim said, and turned and elbowed the monkey gently, and the monkey licked his elbow and then jumped to the floor and went under the stall and disappeared like a rumor that chose another city to live in.\n\nHe had an appointment in the afternoon with a woman from the Department of Cultural Affairs who smelled like a candle. She told him the Civic Theater was going to mount a production of a play called The Last Uncle. \u201cIt\u2019s brave,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about complicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat word,\u201d he said, \u201cthat word will be the end of me.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, and then she didn\u2019t. \u201cDo you have a nephew,\u201d she asked with an innocence he knew was not entirely feigned. He stared at her until her face did a human thing that made him want to forgive her. He nodded. He didn\u2019t say his name. Rory had not asked to be in a conversation with this woman.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do the theater,\u201d he said instead. \u201cDo a bake sale. Bake sales are better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to make art,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll lose your audience,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll deserve it.\u201d\n\nShe left, offended in a way that would become a story she told later at wine.\n\nAt sunset, he walked home by way of the river because the river did not notice monkeys. The river did not notice him. He stopped on the bridge. The bridge shook. A barrel went by, on fire, as if old movies had come to live in their city. He wanted to throw the barrel a graph.\n\nHe didn\u2019t call Miriam. He did not tell her he would not let anyone take Rory. He did not tell her he might have to.\n\nWhen he got home, the hallway was full of smoke. Not a lot. The little kind. The almost. He opened his door fast and went in and heard a popping sound from the kitchen like old film burning. He ran. The stove was off. The note drawer was open. On the counter, a monkey sat with its hand in the sugar jar, looking at him like a cousin. It patted its chest, as if to say, me. He picked up a broom and the monkey leapt to the ceiling lamp and swung, and the lamp went into the ceiling with a sound like a bell. The monkey dropped to the floor and ran down the hall and out the door, which someone had left open on purpose, he thought, but he didn\u2019t know who the someone was.\n\nHe shut the notes in the refrigerator. He laughed at himself, in the mad way you laugh when you\u2019ve done something the opposite of clever. He told himself: this is the first chapter of a book you do not want to read, and he was not wrong, though he was not right, either. He washed his hands. He drank water. He dialed Miriam\u2019s number. He did not hit call.\n\nHe opened his ledger, the paper one he kept for himself, because his mother had raised him to keep one even when the computer was a sweet singer. He wrote:\n\nUncle\u2019s Tithe: not acceptable, not edible.\n\nRory: boy, camera, blue hair, loves olives, hates ladder into wrong house.\n\nMiriam: forehead, coffee, rightness like a stone you could sit on.\n\nCity: on fire but only a little. On fire enough.\n\nMonkeys: rude; reckless; chorus; mirror.\n\nBright Snow: future. Ash. Winter. It rhymes and he wants to refuse the rhyme.\n\nHe shut the book. He put the book under the table. He sat on the floor as if floors were seats. The world outside scraped its nails against the brick. You could hear sirens sometimes, the real ones. You could hear calliope music. You could hear a profound quiet when a troop crossed the street like an army of toddlers. He put his head on his knees. He did not cry. He weighed crying like a purchase and decided to save his money.\n\nThe Harvest Moon was a month away. None of the calendars said it. All of the calendars knew it. The monkeys, who had learned the shape of time the way a child learns to whistle, were already humming the new song, their voices a net thrown over the city, the holes very small.By the next morning the city had found a new way to pretend it was ordinary, which is to say the baker had opened on time and a monkey had already stolen a bag of flour and upended it in the gutter so the sidewalk wore a white rash. Ephraim stepped around the powdered patch and thought, because he could not help it, of the phrase bright snow and the way it lived under everything now, a refrigerator hum in his head. He took the stairs to save his arms from the elastic humiliation of the tram straps. On the landing between the third and fourth floors someone had taped a flyer over an old exterminator advertisement: SENSEFUL STREETS ROUNDTABLE\u2014PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WELCOME. Below in marker, a hand that could have been a boy\u2019s or a monkey\u2019s had added: UNCLE BRINGS SNACKS. The marker had bled through the paper and stained the plaster wall in a shape like a mouth opening.\n\nAt Kettle & Hart, the usual ten-floor howl had tuned itself to morning radio; the monkeys had learned to imitate an ad for life insurance and were practicing it with great seriousness from the fluorescent light tracks, the phrase \u201cyour loved ones\u201d coming out like a growl with an opinion. Darla handed him a sealed envelope with a municipal seal and a cartoon banana pressed into the wax as if it were a crest. Her blouse had turned the color of lawful envy. She kept her face still the way brave people do when they don\u2019t want to make you into a project. \u201cThis came by messenger with a vestibule escort,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made me sign three times with three different pens. I used all of them wrong.\u201d\n\nHe slit the wax with the edge of his thumbnail, which had been made for lesser tasks, and unfolded a summons printed on thick paper that wanted to be a birth certificate. It invited\u2014required\u2014requested his attendance at a midnight session of the Consultative Panel on Equilibrium, to be held in a municipal chamber he had never set foot in, labeled in a font too whimsical to be legal: The Hall of Balances. The letter stressed confidentiality, dignity, and the spiritual seriousness of civic arithmetic. The time\u2014midnight\u2014crackled with ritual like a bonfire concealed under a tarp. The bottom carried the mayor\u2019s rubber signature and the City\u2019s motto, which had always embarrassed him: We Add, We Endure, We Eat What We Must.\n\nHart appeared at his door before he had a chance to fold the paper into a smaller truth. His tie looked like it had given up and was resting between the knots. He glanced at the summons and whistled quietly, a sound that used to call dogs and now called monkeys, although none came. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided to get holy,\u201d Hart said, and let himself in as if the office were a conversation. \u201cDid you bring olives for lunch? Bring olives. You\u2019ll need the salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want me at midnight,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cThey want me where there are no hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want you where clocks dress in robes,\u201d Hart said, with the kind of gallows brightness that gets men invited to panels. He leaned against the bookcase and bumped it with the soft inexorability of a ship into a dock. \u201cDon\u2019t be alone in there. If they say you\u2019re symbolic, say you\u2019re heavy. Symbolic is cheap. Heavy breaks tables.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a theater,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cA theater where they\u2019ll hand me a knife made of vowels.\u201d\n\nHart looked past him into the pane of glass where a juvenile macaque was attempting to see how many paperclips it could put into its nose. \u201cThe theater is the economy right now,\u201d he said, and his voice dropped a half inch. \u201cThere\u2019s rumor that the tithe isn\u2019t a tithe unless the market sees it, that the number doesn\u2019t count unless the head nods and the cameras cut to tears. The monkeys know it\u2019s a show and the money knows it\u2019s a show and the City believes it\u2019s a sacrament. We have more audiences than actors.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you made a deal?\u201d Ephraim asked, because he had to ask, because the thought had been scratching his ribs.\n\nHart\u2019s smile moved left, then right, then left again, as if it had a turn signal. \u201cI signed a letter that said I\u2019d show up for the talk and bring a colander of jokes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I said I would not, under any circumstances, put my hands on a boy. I said that on paper. Sometimes paper is a way of making your hands known to yourself.\u201d He touched the edge of Ephraim\u2019s desk with two fingers, as if it might ask for a blessing. \u201cDon\u2019t go alone. Take a witness. Or take a camera. Or take both and tell one to be quiet.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon had the shape of an overnumerous book. When he could not stare any longer at a cell that equaled itself with a smugness he could not stand, he opened the City\u2019s parcel map and typed in 999 Cherry Road. The map blinked. The road extruded, then retracted. A light gray outline swam into being where a block should be, then faded, as if the block were waiting backstage and the stage manager had not called its name. He found an archival layer from twenty years back and there it was, Cherry Road, a neat line, a small orchard marked with a green fill, a cannery that had been given a little factory icon like the ones in children\u2019s books. The cannery had been decommissioned and then recommissioned as lofts and then condemned and then, apparently, subtracted. A red notice marker toggled on and off like a heartbeat.\n\nHe called a number he was not supposed to have. On the seventh ring a woman answered with her voice wrapped in a scarf. \u201cGeographic Information Services,\u201d she said, and then, as if only one person could have this number, \u201cOh. The accountant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pen-chewer,\u201d he said, and regretted it. \u201cI\u2019m looking at a parcel that keeps changing its mind. 999 Cherry Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call that the vanishing tooth,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cIt\u2019s an error we don\u2019t fix because every time we fix it a monkey shows up in the server room and pulls a cable with the exact tenderness of a midwife. There\u2019s an overlay, Mr. Cole. There\u2019s always an overlay. I can send you a screenshot if you promise to look at it and then delete it from your mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he said. He gave her his private email and received an image that made his heartbeat go tight. The parcel was annotated: BRIGHT BRIDGES TEMPORARY. Under that: CASH PICKUP\u2014UNDER RIVER VIADUCT K. Under that: COMMUNITY APPEASEMENT\u2014FUN. The F\u2019s legba had been rubbed out, leaving UN.\n\nIn the late light he found Lark on the museum steps with a satchel and a grin that had gotten into a fight with reality and lost, but only on points. The professor produced from the bag a thin bone-brown stick carved with a tidy ladder of lines, notches worn down by fingers that had belonged to men who had not known that monkeys could be a committee. \u201cIn case they ask for proof,\u201d Lark said, and passed the tally to Ephraim the way one passes a warm difficult object to a friend. \u201cWe used to reckon with things we could hold. People trusted us because their hands could touch the count.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a place,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cA parcel that pretends to evaporate. 999 Cherry Road.\u201d\n\nLark made a small face that combined delight and dread into a sauce. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, and yes. My student Sheila filmed monkeys there last month wearing hard hats and handing out candy that was also a card with a QR code that led to a clip of the mayor saying the word accommodate. Then the place was gone and the clip had a cat in it that nobody owned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see the place when it\u2019s pretending to be a place,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cI want to know if rituals come with lighting technicians.\u201d\n\nRory appeared from behind the bronze statue of a coin, hands deep in jacket pockets, hair still blue but with dark at the roots like an old lake meeting a newer one. He stood with the showman's patience of a teenager trying not to make it apparent that he had been waiting for the adults to get to the part with the verbs. \u201cIf you\u2019re going,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m filming. I already filmed the barber fire and a monkey throwing up into a boot, and I should probably also film the part of the movie where the uncle becomes a diagram.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talked about ribs,\u201d Miriam said from the step above, and for a second Ephraim\u2019s brain put her there in the picture with Rory where she always went when he imagined them without himself. She had on her coat with the elbow mended and a scarf with cherries on it, because the universe could still be literal when it wanted to hurt you. \u201cWe talked, and you will text me the address of every place you plan to set foot in, and you will use your camera as a shield, not as a sword, and if anything stinks like a plan to make you into a poem, you will leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Ephraim said. It came out like gratitude wrapped in accusation.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cI brought you an apple because you are not going to eat dinner if you\u2019re practicing being a moat.\u201d She touched his cheek with the back of her fingers the way their mother had touched them when she wanted to count what was still warm.\n\nThey walked as a clump under a sky that had put on metal and gone out for the evening. The blocks near the vanished parcel had become a different city than the one on the map: signs replaced by drawings with bulging eyes and tongues; a dry cleaner turned into a studio where a monkey\u2014dressed in plastic pearls and a felt hat\u2014was painting a wall with big black words that said NO, THEN YES, THEN NO again as if the city had to be told every minute which way to tilt. A group of rhesus youths had made themselves a court and were arguing over a stolen sandwich with gestures that mimed gavels and crossed arms that meant the law. A woman with a bundle of something too soft to be laundry stopped and watched, then took out her phone, then put it away with a care that showed she had remembered the cost of losing the smallest thing you have left.\n\nCherry Road turned and stopped. Where the map insisted there should be an address, there was a drawing in chalk on a section of cinderblock: a doorway, very detailed, with hinges shaded into suggestion and a knob drawn as if it could be turned. A vervet reached for the chalk and added a tiny keyhole, then looked at them to see if they would applaud. Behind the chalk door the wall was blank except for a stain shaped like an island and a vertical seam where at some point the city had welded something shut. If you put your ear against it the concrete felt like a muted drum. Rory did. He pulled away with a grin that tried to straddle terror and joy. \u201cThere are trucks in there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is refrigeration. There is a conversation that sounds like people who don\u2019t want their voices to know their faces.\u201d\n\nFrom the alley to the left of the chalk door a van slunk into the street with its headlights off and an orchard printed on its vinyl wrap, glossy cherries fit to burst. Bananas, lashed to the roof with rough rope, made a little yellow crown you would expect to see in a children\u2019s parade. Beside the driver sat a mandrill in a jacket that could have been satin or could have been a reflection of something else trying to be expensive. The mandrill\u2019s eyes, cataracted at the edges, had the bored disdain of a recurring donor. On the rear bumper a small sticker with the City seal had lost a letter so it read PUBL C. The van turned its wheel reluctantly, like a creature doing the thing it had always done while dreaming of a different command, and rolled toward the river.\n\nLark put his hand lightly on Ephraim\u2019s arm in the friend\u2019s version of a brake. \u201cFollow without being,\u201d he said, which was not a sentence that meant anything until it did. Rory fell back and flipped his camera on, the lens sucking light with a purr. They slipped alongside the block like conspirators pretending to be strollers. A troop had taken up a chant that was almost nice if you didn\u2019t translate it. A macaque with a newborn riding its back as if mother had been turned into public transport reached a hand toward Rory\u2019s hair and then withdrew it because the blue spooked it. Near the viaduct an old cannery had been facaded into modern with glass panels and then defaced back into honest with rocks. The van slid into the cannery\u2019s old loading dock like a memory into a void, the wide mouth swallowing and then pretending it had never eaten.\n\nInside, the air kept different accounts. Cold came from the walls. Warmth came from the exhalations of men in municipal polo shirts who were not smiling because their faces had learned that muscles could be watched. A stack of boxes wore the label BRIGHT BRIDGES in a font that said \u201cPlease, we are decent,\u201d and another stack wore no label at all but the cargo speaks: paper, much paper, reams and sheaves and rolls like a banquet for goats. On a whiteboard an internish human hand had diagrammed a calendar with hearts around the Harvest Moon and an event titled in large letters: UNCLE\u2019S PORTION\u2014BROADCAST WINDOW. Under it in a different hand: Call Insurance. Make Snow.\n\nThe mandrill in satin jacket accepted from an eager human a small black thing that might have been a phone or a remote or a trigger. She\u2014this was the same mandrill, Ephraim realized with the small nausea of recognition, the one who had licked the mike in the rotunda and had not afterward gotten sick\u2014touched the device, and a bank of lights flicked on, illuminating a stage that had been made out of pallets and city money. There were props: a ledger, a knife that gleamed with theatrical intent, a bowl, a cheap crown. One of the monkeys in a railworker\u2019s cap hopped onto the pallets and made a speech to the others that was ninety percent insult and ten percent instruction. The instruction was to howl at the moment when the crowd does not know if it ought to cheer.\n\nRory filmed without breathing. Lark mouthed something that could have been the Nicene Creed of accountants, which is to say he mouthed numbers in a sequence meant to bind a panic. Ephraim recognized his own name on a clipboard under a column that said: TALENT. Beside his name, someone had written in a cursive that wanted to be calligraphy, Clean if possible.\n\nA voice came from his left, too close to be safe and too gentle to be hated. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t see this until everyone does,\u201d the woman from Cultural Affairs said, and smiled the way you smile when you bump into a friend at a funeral and do not yet know if you\u2019re both supposed to be there. Her candle smell was faint; the cannery smell was stronger. Her hair was pinned with a green bobby pin that wished it were an emerald. \u201cI told you we\u2019re making a play. We\u2019re just doing it in a space with better acoustics than the city\u2019s failing theater. People listen to concrete.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re laundering policy through art,\u201d Lark said, a little too pleased to be able to accuse anyone of something that had such good rhythm. \u201cYou\u2019re feeding the appetite you pretend to satisfy.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t look at him. She kept her eyes on Ephraim as if his face were a ledger whose totals could not be fudged. \u201cWe\u2019ve modeled it,\u201d she said, and the word model floated between them like a paper ship almost on fire. \u201cThe thing that keeps the rail spurs open long enough to move the fuel and the sea-grain away from the plant in the south is a spectacle that takes the troops off the bridges and the alleys and leaves three hours of unmonkeyed road. The chemical engineers tell me the chillers go from safe to hymn in twenty-seven minutes if the power goes. If the ammonia goes, we get what your friend called bright snow. It\u2019s not a metaphor to them, Mr. Cole. To them it\u2019s a forecast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen tell them,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cTell them the facts. Monkeys aren\u2019t allergic to facts. They just like them in costume.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried,\u201d she said. \u201cThey threw facts in the fountain because they floated. They like things that sink. They like a number that gets wet and falls apart. We tried to give them the math without blood. They ate the paper and asked for salt.\u201d She stepped away, then back, as if the air had a mind. \u201cIf you stand on that pallet and cut what we hand you, you buy us time to move tankers out of the county. If you refuse, you become a different kind of show, and we don\u2019t get the hour. I have to speak to you in cruel clarity because I am tired in a way that doesn\u2019t permit any more embroidery.\u201d\n\nHe heard his phone vibrate the way a heart sometimes remembers it has a job. His sister\u2019s name on the screen made his throat find its mystery. He silenced it, because he needed his hands to be empty to hear the woman say the part she should not say. She leaned in and said it, voice lowered to the register where things are called true because no one else can hear. \u201cThe first note was not wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone likes you enough to put faith in your stomach.\u201d She looked at the stage and then at the vans with the cherries, which had their doors open like open mouths waiting for laughter. \u201cIf there were a way to do this with counterfeit, I would say counterfeit, and we would print a child of paper and feed it to the crowd. But then the crowd would leave with the taste of ink, and they would go to the hospital, and the power would go, and a different ink would print itself on the sky.\u201d\n\nA small shape at the edge of the dock turned and looked at them with the fascination of someone who goes to the movies for the popcorn. The vervet from the chalk door had found them, its hands chalked like a mason\u2019s, and it started to open its mouth and call down a rain of notice. Rory, quicker than a bond trader inventing derivatives, lifted his camera and pointed the lens at the monkey and whispered please. The monkey was vain enough to postpone betrayal to admire its own reflection in a glass it could not break. It grinned, then bit the edge of the lens in a gesture that had no meaning until it did. Its bite left a crescent and the monkey left a giggle and a piss-shiver and ran to tell the world anyway.\n\nThe first guard to turn tracked wrong and saw Lark first because Lark looked like guilt. His hand went to a baton and then to a radio and then to his face because a flock of pigeons rose from the rafters with the thunder of things that are both dumb and numerous, and they startled him into performing a dance that made his dignity buy a hat. The pigeons had been sleeping in the beams until the mandrill pressed the magic remote and filled the room with warm lumens. When confronted with light, pigeons believe they are applause. Lark, because he had been born for this sort of unlikely tutelage, lifted his whistle and blew three short and one long and set the flock\u2019s nouns flying toward the stage. Feathers hit satin with the soft decisiveness of receipts thrown into a fan. The mandrill swore in a language that had been learned from longshoremen and children. A human dropped a clipboard and the papers went far, because paper goes farther than anyone thinks, and one sheet with Ephraim\u2019s name on it sailed under a pallet and hid as if paper had learned loyalty.\n\nThey ran because bodies ask for mercy from thinking. Concrete under shoe, soft shadows that did not belong to humans, the fish-smell of a river that had believed its job was to carry. They would have been caught in a different city. This city, right now, was arguing with itself about whether you catch the people who came to see you when you were breaking the law dressed as mercy. At the dock\u2019s mouth a bandaged capuchin had mounted a forklift and was trying to reverse time with it, the machine\u2019s beep-beep-beep announcing the monkey\u2019s sense of crisis. When it saw Ephraim it scrubbed its face with its hand in an expression that had come from men who miss trains. \u201cPen-chewer,\u201d it said with a glee that made a joke on a ledge, then jerked its head in the direction of an exit disguised as a no-exit sign. \u201cUncle shortcut. Go, go. You owe me a bite.\u201d\n\nThey went, because otters know where the river deepens and sometimes monkeys know where walls forget themselves for a minute. A corridor smelling of hair and dust coughed them into the alley behind the cannery where a truck with bad brakes sighed at the curb. The Cultural Affairs woman had followed and reached the door as they disappeared; she did not shout wait. She put her palm flat to the cold metal and closed her eyes long enough to memorize a prayer, then turned and walked back into the building because her job had refused private vows for her.\n\nThey hid in the museum because everyone hides in a church when they\u2019ve been doing math with knives. Lark took them under the diorama of a medieval counting room where the mannequins wore faces that implied only medium concern. He opened a drawer with a key that had never been friendly and took out a ledger fragment that had been stolen, then returned, then catalogued as a lesson about wrong. On the page the word that meant uncle looked like the word that meant creditor if you bent your head. Lark tapped the ink with one finger as if tapping could undo sorrow. \u201cThere were substitutions,\u201d he said, and his voice did not shake as much as Ephraim expected. \u201cIn one village, the uncle was the vessel for the debt. They called the man uncle because to love him was to love the thing you owed. When the season failed, they killed the ledger. They drowned it, or they burned it, or they fed it to the oxen and then argued about whether eating by proxy solved anything. There is a fresco in Bologna where a line of men in shirts carry an account book to a river as if it is a boy made of paper. Someone could have said, This is childish. Someone might have said, Our enemies will laugh. But the winter after that there wasn\u2019t a famine. That\u2019s the kind of story people keep by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can feed them numbers,\u201d Rory said, softly, as if softness could keep the walls from hearing. He held up his camera like an oath. \u201cWe can make them into food. We can print whatever this Uncle\u2019s Fund is\u2014whatever the pages say the city  owns of itself\u2014and we can burn that instead. We can bring it in boxes with cherries on them and let the monkeys tear the paper with their teeth and we can film the sound and it will be the sound. We make a banquet of the part that is eating us already and we let it be eaten.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be allowed to print the city,\u201d Ephraim said. His own voice sounded unfamiliar in the room. It had become a voice that expected to be told it was quaint. \u201cI barely get to color the city. Darla will get a memo that says we\u2019re all allergic to toner.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t print the city,\u201d Lark said. He leaned forward, eyes brighter than the time when he\u2019d seen a potshard confirm a hunch. \u201cYou print scrip. You print bright, beautiful, edible money that stands in for the debt. Not counterfeit of currency\u2014counterfeit of an idea. We rename Uncle\u2019s Tithe to Uncle\u2019s Write-off. We stage a closing of accounts. We break the ladder that goes from loss to boy and lay down a different ladder, made of paper and salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt only works if they believe the paper tastes good,\u201d Rory said. He had turned his lens toward them and then away, filming the mannequins as if the frozen paperwork of five hundred years ago had something to say about never letting anybody get away with calling hunger a moral. \u201cIt only works if the men with the cherries and the insurance don\u2019t give another speech in a room with better lights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll try,\u201d Lark said. \u201cTheir mouths are rented. Their words are a fleet.\u201d\n\nA tapping sounded on the window behind the display. A monkey had retrieved a stapler from somewhere and was pretending to use it on its own tail. Another monkey, smaller, lifted a handful of something white and blew it against the glass. The something drifted down, ash from one of the small fires, catching on the window\u2019s pitting. Bright snow, thought Ephraim, and his stomach forgot it belonged to him for a second. He stood up and the body that had always liked to calculate did the thing bodies do when they have reached a ledge and see a rope hanging: it reached for the rope.\n\n\u201cI need Hart,\u201d he said. \u201cI need a press that can make a lot of sin in a very short time. I need Darla to pretend what I am doing is a milk run. I need the mayor\u2019s assistant to send me a list of everything we can legally paint yellow and have it not be a crime. I need Miriam not to forgive me immediately. I need her to watch it first and then decide if what I broke was smaller than what I kept.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can get you the press,\u201d Lark said, because if you stay in a museum long enough you learn that there is always an extra press leaning against a wall behind something else. \u201cA student can get you five. The interns want to be arrested by a narrative. They have been waiting to be told what their lesson is. We can print with soy ink. It tastes like beans. We can cut the scrip into mouth-size with those terrible paper cutters that whisper about fingers. We can stamp the backs with a seal you can smell. If you can\u2019t smell a seal, you won\u2019t believe you should eat it.\u201d\n\nRory texted someone with thumbs that had learned their alphabet while standing on buses. \u201cI know a print shop that owes me a favor because I filmed their flood,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have stacks they will call trash if anyone asks after them. They have a guillotine cutter with a handle you pull like a heart. They will help if we call it a pop-up.\u201d\n\nMiriam\u2019s reply to the text Ephraim sent\u2014Trust me\u2014came back like a stone that had been warmed by a sun she had carried in her pocket. It said: I will watch. Her second text: Do not practice any vows without me. Her third: Bring the olives. That was how forgiveness in their family worked sometimes; it arrived in a bowl and you put your fingers in and got them oiled.\n\nBack in his office, Hart listened to the plan and rolled it around his mouth as if he were testing whether the salt content would make him drink or sing. He pulled down a binder marked Retired Hardware and found in it, with the glee of a boy remembering that he had a slingshot in the attic, a permit number that belonged to a plant that had once exploded and then been rebuilt, then put out of memory and allowed to rest. \u201cWe can borrow their stamp,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll think we\u2019re honoring their contribution to the civic fabric. They\u2019ll send snacks.\u201d\n\nDarla printed him three copies of a memo with the subject line: OLD PAPER DISPOSAL\u2014NO ACTION. She affixed to each a Post-it with a cartoon banana drawn in a competent hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get these from me,\u201d she said, and tucked her hair behind her ear and gave him the look people get when they are shipping you to war and want you to come back carrying a story and not a flag. \u201cIf a monkey asks, you\u2019re returning toner.\u201d\n\nThey moved the first pallets of scrip at night because night had been taught to behave, to stop asking questions you could not answer with a badge. The scrip looked obscene, the way too much bread looks obscene when you stack it on a table in a room with thin people. The sheets were vivid with symbols that borrowed the authority of the City while clearly being fake in a way that could be forgiven because the fake tasted like something. The seal said: SUBSTITUTE. The line under it said: THE CITY EATS ITS PAPER TO SAVE ITS PEOPLE. Under that, in small print that was more confession than law: This is a ritual. It may stain.\n\nWhen the monkeys came to sniff\u2014and of course they came, because monkeys adore the smell of any new permission\u2014they tasted and then made their faces, the good faces, the ones that say I didn\u2019t know I was hungry for this. They cackled and threw little handfuls in the air and the paper drifted like forgiving weather. A troupe chanted a nonsense hymn to food that wasn\u2019t food, and the rhyme scheme held. Rory filmed from a truck bed and caught the moment an old woman in a hat with fake cherries tore a scrip sheet into strips and fed one piece ceremoniously to the capuchin with the bandaged ear. The monkey chewed with the slow solemnity of a critic. It smacked and then said, in a human tone it had learned to use only when it really meant to be heard, \u201cSalt,\u201d and the crowd laughed and the laughter lifted.\n\nHe could feel, even before he saw it, the shape of the countershow being set on the pallets in the cannery, the stage\u2019s wood sweating under lights, the bowl waiting to be filled with the thing that would make the calendar keep going. He could feel the chemical plant beyond the south rail spurs straining, something inside it pressing its cheek to the glass of its own container. The phone lit with a message from the Cultural Affairs woman that did not art at all. It said: Two hours, if you can hold them. Then another: Please be vulgar. It pulls them harder.\n\nThey were vulgar. They were shameless. They were financial. At the Hall of Balances, which turned out to be in the basement of City Hall with a fresco of scales and a leak in the corner, the mayor and four men who had shaved twice that day waited with their lapel flags and their bottled water and their list of words not to say. At midnight, the time they had chosen because it sounded like guilt, the hall was empty except for the people whose schedules no longer belonged to them and one mandrill who had come to see if the City would embarrass itself properly. Ephraim brought scrip in. He put a stack on the table like a man bringing bread to a meeting that might kill him. He looked at the mayor and saw a man made of calculations, and it moved something in him like pity shaking a hinge, just a little.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t do the boy,\u201d he said, and the words, when said, made a shape in the room that had not been available to them before. He held up a page stamped SUBSTITUTE and saw how the mandrill\u2019s eyes blinked in a pattern that could have been grief. \u201cWe will do the ledger. We will do the paper you have been hiding under names made of cousins. We\u2019ll do it now. The city will watch, and then the city will eat.\u201d\n\nThe mayor rubbed his forehead like a man polishing a coin. He looked at the mandrill, as if the animal had become his conscience, and the mandrill bared its teeth the way laughter bares teeth. The Cultural Affairs woman nodded, very slightly. Hart stood at the back and looked like a ship\u2019s mast. Darla would never know she had been in the room, and she would keep that as a good thing tucked into her desk like a holy card.\n\nOutside, the first crowd was forming around the pop-up and the second crowd was forming around the rumor that something was about to make a different kind of sense. A few flakes of ash had begun again, slow and idiotic, not ominous yet, the way bad news sometimes enters from an angle. Monkeys lined the rooftops with the patience of men who have been promised a cannon. Somewhere, a horn played a note that was almost minor and then corrected itself. The city inhaled, the sound of a place that had learned that breath is a vote, and Ephraim lifted the first stack of substitute debt and held it for the hands that were waiting. He thought of Miriam\u2019s texts, a little drizzle of olive oil on everything, and of Rory\u2019s camera recording history\u2019s second take, and of Lark\u2019s bone stick, a ladder for tiny fingers, and he thought, with the clarity of a man who has tried to imagine himself a knife and has shied, that one of the uses of a city might be to write new numbers down and make them true.\n\nHe did not like that he had become the person who had to say the next sentence out loud. He did not like that the sentence he was about to say was both a con and a rescue. He shook his head once to make the bad part fall out and found that nothing fell. He put his hand on the pile of edible paper, looked at the mayor, and then looked at the mandrill, and then looked at the room, and then, because someone had to start, he said, \u201cEat.\u201dThe city ate. It did not do it neatly, because nothing since the monkeys arrived had been neat, but it did it with the sincerity of hunger meeting a form it could recognize. In the Hall of Balances the first mouth to close on the scrip was the mandrill\u2019s, though later the mayor would say, hand on heart, that he had led. She took a sheet between her molars, bored eyes flicking from Ephraim to the knife on the ceremonial cloth and back again, and she chewed like a scholar who distrusts every source. When she swallowed, a murmur went around the room that had a shape like applause trying not to get arrested. The mayor tore a corner, grimaced as the soy salt hit his tongue, and performed the swallowing with a theatricality that made his tie look like a prop. Hart did it with a grin, Darla with the prim satisfaction of a woman who had learned to take communion and later learned to keep a ledger. The Cultural Affairs woman did not eat; she stood by the door like a match in a box and let her eyes do the chewing.\n\nOutside the Hall, in the open-lit rooms of the city where nothing was secret anymore unless it was printed in a font from the wrong century, the pop-ups bloomed. They called them, because people will always name a procession they don\u2019t fully understand, paper feasts, write-off tables, Uncle\u2019s buffet. The first one at the cannery dock had epaulets of monkeys along the roofline who made a music of their own with their teeth. The second, in front of the Countinghouse, was a solemn affair officiated by Lark in his numbered tie, who insisted on telling each volunteer, as if the city needed a liturgy, what a ledger was and why you could drown it and still keep your house. Rory climbed onto a truck bed and filmed until his battery sang low and then stole a charge from a sympathetic fruit stand that had decided oranges were a kind of ornament for civic rites. Miriam stood by the olive bowl to which she had held him earlier and passed out green eyes to those who wanted to wash the ink taste from their mouths. She had the face she wore when she might soon need to forgive.\n\nThe chant, once the monkeys decided it, hummed across blocks: Eat the paper, keep the breath. Eat the paper, keep the wheels. They liked any song that could be clapped, and the clapping carried the sheets into fingers that had always meant to hold a little more than they did. In the south, where the rail spurs quivered like the veins in a too-thin wrist, an engineer with a stutter counted backward in his head and watched the gauge climb and then wobble and then drop as the load pulled out. He did not believe in magic, but he believed in minutes, and the pop-up showed him its face in all the cars that were not in his way. The \u201cbright snow\u201d remained a phrase, which is to say it remained potential, which is to say he went home that night and put his children to bed and did not open the drawer with the pills that promise to smooth your breathing.\n\nThe cannery stage, robbed of its boy and its camera-ready throat, pivoted. The mandrill flicked the remote and the pallets rolled, the bowl was filled with shredded scrip instead of something that breathed, and an underpaid man whose job did not include the word faith lit a match to a line of fuel poured under the props to give the spectacle its necessary hiss. The monkeys jeered and then, because mockery tires like anything, they laughed and stuffed their mouths with the softened substitute. A faction on the rafters banged pipes in a rhythm that had been used to call men to work and later to call them to wake. A smaller faction hissed the word \u201ccowards\u201d in human language and jumped from beam to beam with a purpose that smelled like coming trouble. The Cultural Affairs woman stood near the soundboard in a dress that looked like it could be washed with a sponge and gave hand signals to a technician who translated theatre into weather.\n\nNews crawled across screens in that mutant idiom the city had taught its anchors: \u201cCity chooses carbs over carnage,\u201d said one. \u201cUncle\u2019s Appetite Satisfied by Scrip,\u201d said another, and then, in smaller font that bit the eye, \u201cChem Plant Avoids Worst-Case.\u201d An online magazine called it \u201critual arbitrage\u201d and posted a photo of a rhesus with soy-ink on its chin. Commenters did what they always did, composed small epics of rage and wit and injury, and out of the noise one coherent current announced itself like a river showing its channel: we will let a paper cut us if it keeps the knives off the table.\n\nKettle & Hart smelled like glue and victory on the morning after. The monkeys had found the shredder and fed it a scarf and called it opera. Darla changed her blouse for one the color of queenly patience and arranged a stack of memos in a line that looked like a road out of town. Hart took his shoes off in his office and put his feet on the radiator, which did not work, and declared himself a small nation with a hot climate. He was pleased in a tender way that made Ephraim want to forgive him for the jokes he would make later at bars that would pretend to be sober. He clapped once when Ephraim went by, not for the prank of it but as a private sacrament, and then he said, \u201cYou printed a thing and then you made it true. That\u2019s the deepest sin we have and also the only virtue left to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like you\u2019ve been practicing in front of a mirror,\u201d Ephraim said, and then smiled to take the edge off the truth.\n\n\u201cI have,\u201d Hart said. \u201cI write my lines on the bathroom tile with my finger and watch the steam erase them. It makes me feel like a gentleman.\u201d He lowered his feet. \u201cThere\u2019ll be blowback. There\u2019s always blowback when you satisfy an appetite that wanted a different menu. The mayor will attempt to name the ritual after a park. The Council will recommend that we establish a committee on edible paper standards. Cultural Affairs will hire a choreographer. A faction will call it cowardice. A different faction will call it cannibalism anyway, because they love a long word more than they love mercy.\u201d\n\nIn the late morning, an email with the subject line PUBLIC SIMIAN INTEGRATION FUND\u2014CLARIFICATIONS landed in Ephraim\u2019s inbox and split into five smaller emails as if it had been built by lizards. The first declared the success of last night\u2019s intervention and attached a PDF with photos of monkeys mid-chew that would surely be printed in a magazine where the layout designer had a grudge against captions. The second asserted that Uncle\u2019s Tithe had been sunsetted and replaced by Uncle\u2019s Write-off, a phrase that made his stomach do a small, intractable thing. The third admonished all parties to refrain from politicizing what was purely an economic ritual. The fourth announced the establishment of a permitting process for public consumption of scrip, complete with an application that required, in triplicate, proof of olive procurement. The fifth reminded him, personally, to keep to grayscale and to remember that color was for parks.\n\nLark arrived with a hand full of newspaper and the air of a man who has found himself on the right side of a legend and is grateful but bewildered. He laid the pages on Ephraim\u2019s desk and smoothed them with a palm as if all paper deserved gentled. \u201cThey\u2019re going to ask you to do it once a week,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to ask you to put it on the calendar like trash day, and they will do it with the equivocal blessing of the mandrill and the open question of the monkeys who wanted to see you bleed. They cannot help themselves. Systems want to be seasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not erecting a holiday,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cI\u2019m not making a cake. We did it to get the trucks through.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrucks will need to get through every week,\u201d Lark said, and shrugged with the apology of a man who has broken hearts by describing a stone. \u201cOnce you feed a city a story, it stands on the corner at the same time the next day to see if the story will come back around.\u201d\n\nHe took the long way to lunch because he couldn\u2019t bear the strap-song of the tram with its music of monkeys and metal fatigue. Miriam was waiting on a bench with a bag of cherries that looked like proof a tree could still be a parent. She handed him the bag without ceremony and leaned her head on his shoulder for a number of seconds that had its own unit of measure. Rory sat on the ground, cross-legged, camera on his knee, editing with the kind of focused shamelessness that makes art indifferent to its audience. When he looked up, Ephraim saw that a sleep had moved across his face like a small tide and left a mark that made him look more mortal, which is to say more here.\n\n\u201cIt worked,\u201d Rory said without asking a question. \u201cI have footage of a macaque with paper in its teeth looking at the lens like the lens had committed a sin. I have a woman wearing a hat with cherries wiping her mouth after she ate the seal with SUBSTITUTE on it as if she had kissed someone she didn\u2019t want anyone to know about. I have the mandrill\u201d \u2014and here his voice got that thin shimmer of disbelief\u2014 \u201csmiling with ink on her gums. I could make thirty different films. I\u2019m going to make one and it\u2019s going to be about you and it\u2019s also not going to be about you at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a hero,\u201d Ephraim said, because you have to say it, and also because he meant it, and also because he knew it had no power to redirect anything.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rory said. \u201cHeroes are inconvenient to everyone. I\u2019d rather film a person who solved a gross problem with a grosser joke.\u201d\n\nMiriam chewed a cherry and spit the pit into her palm the way a lady might spit a bullet that someone had fired to make a point. \u201cWe\u2019re not done,\u201d she said, when she had her mouth back. \u201cI woke up at four because the radio told me to and I had a thought I hated and then I kept it because maybe hating is a way of knowing it\u2019s important. If the city wants to make this a ritual, we can keep showing up with our paper and our olives, but\u2014\u201d She paused, because words like but can carry a house on their back. \u201cThere\u2019s a cost to pretending to eat a boy. Even if the mouth knows it\u2019s paper, the mind learns a posture. Rory says film can teach us a posture and unteach it, but film is a slow teacher. Do we want that posture in the city\u2019s spine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Ephraim said, and his voice did a little thing it does when it runs into a wall where an answer hides. \u201cBut I do want the part where we don\u2019t freeze to death in snowfall made of wrong. I keep seeing it when I close my eyes. It looks like someone emptied flour in the street and then told you to breathe deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we do it once,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cWe do it twice if the trucks say please. We don\u2019t do it a third time unless the river changes its mind. We pretend to the city that we are creatures who can leave a habit before the habit has a chance to make a hoodie out of us.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to say yes to everything she said because she was his sister and because the little theater of his life had always played better with her in the front row, but the habit he had made of truth tapped at his ribs. \u201cThey\u2019ve already sent a memo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a form and a seal. They\u2019re going to ask for live music. They\u2019re going to ask for children to hold the banners because children make the news camera turn into a dog that lies down.\u201d\n\nMiriam\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cThen I will hold the banner and bite the reporter,\u201d she said, and they both smiled, because if you can\u2019t laugh while you\u2019re deciding how not to feed your family to an idea, you will cry until your eyes forget how to do anything else.\n\nBy evening the improvisation had become a procession. Men who liked to coordinate told people where to stand and the people ignored them. A troop of spider monkeys discovered that if they held the paper under the tap in the park it turned into something like soup, and that if you drank that you got the sensation of having eaten a complicated thought, and the sensation was satisfying if you were made of nerves. A bar made cocktails with a garnish of substitute scrip and called them Uncle\u2019s Apology. A child no one knew put two pieces of scrip under a rock and declared he had planted a money tree and then wept when the monkeys dug it up and wore the pieces like eyebrows. The police put tape around nothing and then took the tape down and wore it as headbands. A butcher taped a sign to his window that read: We Sell Only Animals, Not Narratives, and a clever rhesus corrected it to Not Yet. In the south the tankers cleared the crossing and a man with a vest cried into his safety glasses where no one could see it and then went into the break room and ate a whole bag of potato chips without tasting a thing.\n\nAt the Cannery, where everything had started wanting to be real and had been redirected into real enough, the mandrill watched with half-closed eyes while a troupe of her cousins tore the substitute into necklaces. She had a way of scratching her shoulder that was primate and also very much like a woman in a nice chair remembering a song. When Ephraim came within earshot she made a sound that was not speech but was the sound old women in his family made when someone they had worried about walked in breathing. \u201cYou bought the hour,\u201d she said, in the language you use to hand a person a coin and ask them not to inspect its edges. \u201cThe others will say it was their whistle or their tantrum, but you bought it, and I will not forget that until forgetting becomes fashionable again.\u201d\n\nHe thought of asking her what she had wanted him to do with the knife, if he had chosen the other road, but the monkey in her brows made him stop. \u201cWill they accept this every time,\u201d he asked instead, and he knew he was being a bureaucrat even as he felt the shame of it. \u201cWill your theatre hold.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them want blood,\u201d she said, and the words came out so evenly it took his skin a beat to prickle. \u201cSome of them want wheat. Some of them want only to throw rocks and see what noise the glass makes. We will argue among ourselves in a way that looks like dancing to you. The little ones will love the taste and the noise. The old will get belly aches and call in sick to scratching. The males with opinions will stand up high and make announcement after announcement until their throats hurt. There will be a day when nothing works and your paper tastes like a lie and our children bite your fingers. But\u2014\u201d Her gaze flicked to the empty stage and then to the river, and for a moment she was only animal in a running world. \u201cNot tonight.\u201d\n\nWhen he reached his building the bakery had kept the light on over the glass case like a watchman who needed company. He bought a bag of yesterday\u2019s rolls because the women in his family had taught him about thrift and because carrying bread had started to feel like carrying a signature. The baker, who had always looked like a saint in a painting that someone had given up trying to sell, shook his head at the news and said, in the simple language he saved for meat and for grief, that the numbers would not help him if the flour trucks didn\u2019t stop being afraid. Ephraim promised him he would print something for the trucks to eat if they refused to move, and the baker laughed so carefully the air stayed where it was supposed to.\n\nBack upstairs, the notes in the refrigerator had fogged. He took them out and read them again, because his brain had a chewiness that demanded he test the flavor until it faded. The first note\u2019s command had dulled since he had put it under the cold; the second looked absurd, like a child\u2019s threat; the third, which he had not read in the anger of the smoke, was written in the same careful hand and said only: You are late. He held it under his nose and the sugar-smell rose again, interleaved with something like clean cardboard. He thought of the Cultural Affairs woman and her candle. He thought of the bakery and its dusting sugar and the devastation of flour if it chose to float. He thought of the cannery and its cherries, the packhouse and its labels, the van with its orchard wrap. He thought about who in a city writes pretty and who writes cruel, and found that the list overlapped in a way that made his throat thick.\n\nSleep came as a collection of visits rather than a single stay. In one, his mother was adding and he was subtracting, and she smiled the way a woman smiles when the man in the suit tells her a number that will decide a week. In another, the monkeys had learned to staple clouds to the sky and were trying to keep the weather from leaving. In a third, he watched a ledger drown in a river and found that it floated, that the ink bled into the water and turned the current into a sentence that said, in a language he had taught his career not to understand, not every debt gets paid.\n\nHe woke with a conviction that frightened him, which is that life wanted to make the ritual weekly and that he would have to break it before it hardened into a law. He lay with it for a while, as you lie with a fever to see if it will pass, and then he sat up and wrote in his paper ledger the only sentence he could write about it: habit is hunger wearing a suit. He folded the ledger back into its old patience and went to the window. The morning was cloudy in every way that word could be meant. The monkeys had hung strings between the fire escapes and were trying the concept of laundry; two socks, a shirt, something that might once have been a bra but had given itself to a performance, a page of substitute scrip with a bite taken out of it clipped by two old teeth.\n\nThe day brought the first formal assertion by a group with a font: SENSEFUL STREETS issued a statement on paper the color of sidewalk that said, in words too symmetrical to be believed, that the city had traded integrity for chewing gum. A different group, whose press releases had until now been concerned chiefly with birds, applauded the ritual as a victory for symbolic diets. The mayor announced the creation of a task force wearily called The Ritual Advisory Council, and in the same breath denied that any ritual existed and insisted that if it did exist it had always been part of the civic charm. Darla brought him a donut that had been made by a monkey at the bus depot learning to fry and said she would fight anyone who tried to make her eat paper instead of pastry on Fridays.\n\nOn the second night, a counter-rite took place in the Ward with the broken clock, which was always late and therefore was often right. A troupe of capuchins with faces like badgers held up a drawing of a boy and stabbed it with plastic knives. The human crowd did not cheer. It did not hiss. It made a noise he had heard only twice before\u2014the night his mother\u2019s factory closed and the day he had to tell Miriam that their father had given away some money that had never been his to give. It was a noise of pure, unembellished sick. The capuchins dropped the knives the way a child drops a stick after a dog growls. Someone in the back started singing the paper chant and it spread like mold. The plastic knives ended the night in the fountain, fossilized under a layer of public water that had long since learned to accept.\n\nHe went to the plant in the south three days after the first rite because he had to see what it was he had bought with the city\u2019s mouth. The engineer with the stutter showed him gauges with needles that moved calmly now, fat and almost smug. The chillers hummed with a tone that suggested satisfaction without arrogance. A man on a lift waved. A woman with a clipboard made a checkmark that felt like the opposite of a death notice. In a side yard a piece of insulation white as flour shivered in a wind you would not know how to name if you had not earned it with a life. He stood there until his breath settled into the rhythm of machines that did not wish to explode, and then he turned to go and saw, over the fence, on a building that had been left to angels, a phrase in monkey paint that read REAL MEAT with the E crossed three times. He felt the old cold, because there is always a faction, and the faction had learned to write.\n\nBack at Kettle & Hart, the fourth note waited on his chair. It had been slipped under the cushion, as if a polite burglar had come for a nap. The hand was the same, the neatness of someone who pens their cruelty like a clerk. It said: Substitution buys time, not debt forgiveness. The math has a stomach. We will come back in a fortnight for the due. The smear at the bottom was not sugar. He touched it and smelled it and thought it was ink, cheap and wanting to flake. He went to the window and found, because the city was no longer generous with ignorance, that a rhesus was watching him with the curiosity of a child in a museum staring at a mummy. He held the note up to the glass. The rhesus put a hand to the glass, palm to palm with him for a second, and then licked the pane and ran.\n\nThe Cultural Affairs woman texted him just before dusk to ask him to coffee and then amended it to ask him, with the boldness of someone who has run out of substitute verbs, to absolution. He met her at a place that had once been a poetry venue and was now a room where the espresso machine tried to be louder than the city. She smelled less like candle and more like scorched milk. She had not slept, or she had slept and had dreamed of a city that ate the wrong thing.\n\n\u201cWe negotiated,\u201d she said without saying hello. \u201cWe will change the weekly to a floating rite. We will deny it ever happened while asking you to keep a press on standby. We will ask the rail men to sign a pledge to call before they need it. We will ask the plant to create redundancies named after saints. We will try to teach the monkeys a song about chlorination. We are making a cultural practice out of a rumor. I have always wanted to earn my pension with a mural, not with a clever mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wrote the notes,\u201d he asked, because if you\u2019re going to sit across from someone whose job is to turn blood into policy you may as well ask them to tell you who in the city writes in the hand that makes you think of grade school.\n\nShe looked into her cup as if there were ethics at the bottom. \u201cThere are three people with that hand,\u201d she said. \u201cOne is a woman who used to teach Latin and now photographs weddings in rooms with exposed brick. One is a man who designs logistics for a grocery chain and is the only person I know who pronounces cumin like he\u2019s afraid of it. One is my deputy, who has a daughter named after a month. They all smell like sugar sometimes, because we all smell like sugar now. The bakery has been running its mixers through the night For Morale. I didn\u2019t write them. I have other sins I will cop to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho chose me,\u201d he asked. \u201cNot in a cosmic way. In a paperwork way. Who wrote my name under TALENT. Who twisted the knives into props and my body into a card in a Rolodex.\u201d\n\nShe lifted her shoulders and let them fall, a little. \u201cTen hands and none. The city knows your face now. Monkeys know it. People who hate the city know it. People who love it know it. When a ritual wants to be born, it shops for a midwife with a mouth that looks like it could say the word no and then fail to. You were available. You were brave in the way careful men are brave. You had a sister. Someone wrote your name because their hand had to write a name, and because yours sat up straight on the line. I am sorry for that, which is a small apology in a room full of small apologies.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t forgive her, and he did, because forgiveness now was a thing you kept in a jar and spread thin. The monkeys outside on the telephone wire imitated the coffee machine until the barista went out and clapped at them and they clapped back and everyone laughed and then looked down because laughing had started to feel like something you should ask permission to do.\n\nThey did the rite again a week later, because a transformer blew in the north and the rolling blackouts moved like a rumor through the grid and a truck stalled on a ramp and a man in a booth somewhere thought of his children in beds and called a number he had written on the back of a paycheck stub. They hid the second rite inside a street fair so the logistics could blend with the sausages, and that made it worse and better. Some people choked on both and blamed the other. A trombone played a song about famine. A woman danced a dance she had learned on an island where the droughts had faces. A monkey put two pieces of scrip over its eyes and declared itself a prophetic accountant and fell off a trash can with a dignity you could not teach. The three hours came, and the three hours went, and again the city did not snow the wrong snow.\n\nAfter, in the little midnight, a troop waited outside his door in a huddle that might have been ominous and might have been family. The bandaged capuchin from the tram sat on the stoop with a solemnity that made it look briefly human in a way that hurt. It patted the step next to it so hard the dust rose. He sat because the night suggested it. It reached into a pocket it should not have had and took out a folded thing that turned out to be a photo of a boy with blue hair and a camera. It held the photo up like a mirror and then like a map and then like a thing you give to a man when you want to see if he will look away. \u201cUncle,\u201d it said, and for the first time the voice was without its wire-scrape. \u201cIf something wants him, I bite. If something wants you, I film.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d he asked, because the question is the only bread most nights.\n\n\u201cBecause you fed me paper when I wanted a knife,\u201d the capuchin said, and then, in a hurry, as if the words might burn its mouth, \u201cBecause I like your sister\u2019s olives.\u201d It tucked the photo back into its imaginary pocket and hopped away as if the step had finished listening.\n\nHe slept in spurts and woke to a heartbeat that did not belong to him. It took him longer than it should have to realize the sound came from the opposite side of his door, where something with an insistence that had learned to stand knocked politely, once, and then waited as if it knew the house. He stood and felt his body do the math of fight or flight and choose neither, because the city had taught him a third answer. He opened the door. Miriam stood there with her scarf askew and a righteousness that had learned to say please. Behind her, Rory hung back with his camera turned off and his eyes on. Between them, on the landing, a man with a municipal badge and a face like wet cardboard clutched a clipboard in both hands and read from it as if reading would protect him from being charred by their attention. He said the words slowly so none of them would fail to enter the house: \u201cNotice of Intention to Formalize Civic Rite,\u201d and then he read the line that turned Ephraim\u2019s stomach into a salt pan: \u201cThe City requires the presence of the Appointed at Harvest Moon in the Hall of Balances to conduct the Write-off in full view, pursuant to Section 9 of the Emergency Equilibria, with components to be determined by the Council in consultation with Simian Representatives. Noncompliance triggers contingency Theta, colloquially known as the Bright Snow Clause.\u201d He looked up with the apology of a man whose job made him a mouth for a god he did not choose. \u201cSir,\u201d he said, \u201cthey told me to say the words as gently as I could, and they did not tell me what they mean by \u2018components.\u2019\u201dChapter 7\n\nThe man with the municipal badge shook the clipboard twice as if trying to wake it, and then he held it to his chest like a life preserver that had decided to be a door. He had on the kind of raincoat that made weather look personal. His eyes were the small kind of tired, the kind that belongs to a person who has not yet earned a big tired. Miriam did not invite him in, which was a kindness disguised as rudeness; the landing was small but larger than any room that agreed to hold policy. Rory leaned sideways and read the word components with his camera hand, his other hand in his pocket the way some young men hide a prayer.\n\n\u201cWhat do they mean by components,\u201d Miriam asked, and the municipal man performed a mouth that was almost a shrug.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t say,\u201d he replied. He had a voice that belonged to filing cabinets. \u201cThe memo arrived with the seal, and the seal arrived with a note that said Don\u2019t elaborate. The phrase is in italics. Italics make people feel better about cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho sent you,\u201d Ephraim asked. He was polite in the old way because his body could not suddenly be rude; the habit had settled into his muscles the way certain songs stay in a church.\n\n\u201cConsultative Panel on Equilibrium,\u201d the man said, and the title tried to float away, ashamed of its own adjectives. \u201cThe chair is the mayor on paper and a woman from Cultural Affairs in practice. The simian contingent is represented by the mandrill, a juvenile rhesus for optics, and a chimpanzee who never speaks and therefore is taken very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them we received the notice,\u201d Miriam said. Her mouth did not curl. \u201cTell them we are considering our wardrobe.\u201d\n\nThe man nodded in the solemn rhythm of a park pigeon. \u201cI have to get five signatures that say I handed this over,\u201d he said, and produced a pen like a magician who hates applause. They signed where he pointed. He thanked them as if they had given him a glass of clean water, then went down the stairs by counting them, because counting is how some people keep from becoming.\n\nWhen the door shut, the landing exhaled like a stomach after dinner. Miriam turned to her brother with a face that had decided not to make a scene, which made the scene knock louder. She walked into the kitchen without invitation, which is how family says yes to the worst and the best, and filled three glasses with water from the tap as if the tap ought to be invoked before any oath. The kitchen had the modest dignity of a man who is precise about salt. The refrigerator compressor hummed like a minor choir. The notes in the drawer\u2014he had put them back in cold because superstition needs a shelf\u2014clicked like cards when he closed the door too hard.\n\n\u201cThey want to put on a longer play,\u201d Rory said, with the blunt clarity art sometimes borrows from weather. \u201cThey want spectacle enough to eat more time. They want to own the word Harvest the way festivals own months. Components means blood, or hair, or witness, or something that can be measured with regret. If they can\u2019t get blood they\u2019ll ask for tears and call it saline.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can have mine,\u201d Miriam said, and the words had iron filings in them. \u201cThey can have my hair, they can have my spit, they can have my right to look ridiculous in public. They cannot have my son\u2019s presence as a prop. If they want the sight of kin, they can look at a city street. Every face is cousin to every other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may not need Rory\u2019s body,\u201d Ephraim said, and felt how stupid it sounded as it left. \u201cThey may only need his proximity. They only need him the way a star needs an edge to hang on. They can say the word nephew while the camera finds him. They can let me say his name while they let the city watch to see if my mouth trembles appropriately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t say it,\u201d Miriam replied. She put the glass down harder than water requires. \u201cYou say ledger, you say paper, you say substitute, you say write-off until the word loses all flavor and then you say it again. You don\u2019t say the word they think buys them holiness. You don\u2019t give them an altar that looks like a family.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to promise and found his throat protective of nothing. He imagined the Hall of Balances at midnight with its fresco of scales already tilting their faces toward any noise. He imagined the mandrill\u2019s bored eyes and the juvenile rhesus sitting up straight to make his elders proud in front of cameras. He imagined the Cultural Affairs woman with her candle smell and her clipboard full of verbs already chosen. He imagined the empty clause that said components and left the city\u2019s mouth to fill it with what was handy. He set his glass down and coughed once because there are sounds a body makes when it agrees to carry something it doesn\u2019t know the weight of.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll negotiate,\u201d he said, and found he was speaking to his own hands. \u201cIf they want components, they\u2019ll get paper. They\u2019ll get ink. They\u2019ll get hair that is not human. They\u2019ll get tears that are not mine. They\u2019ll get a ledger that has learned to swim. We\u2019ll smother them in the correct thing until they forget the wrong thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go with you,\u201d Miriam said. She had her coat already, as if her body could rehearse the future and feel safer. \u201cIf they let us, we go into that room. If they don\u2019t let us, we stand in the hall with the women who know how to look like the past that won\u2019t move. I\u2019ll bring olives, and if they try to take the bowl, I\u2019ll bite.\u201d\n\nRory looked at him the way boys look at rivers they\u2019re about to film, with awe and with an assessment of whether the current wants to keep the camera. \u201cI\u2019ll make a piece before the Harvest,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a protest piece, not agitprop, because propaganda just teaches the mouth to say a new lie. A piece that teaches posture. Something that shows the city how to refuse to open its jaw for anything but paper. I\u2019ll cut it so that to watch it is to learn a muscle. I\u2019ll put it on every screen that wants to swallow it. I\u2019ll seed it in the monkeys\u2019 phones with a sound that makes them think it\u2019s one of theirs.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Ephraim said, and felt the mercy of command, which is that sometimes you get to tell someone to build the thing you need and to receive from their yes a future you didn\u2019t have to watch being born. \u201cMake it a tutorial. Make it an infection. Make it vulgar and soft. Make it eat everything except us.\u201d\n\nThe pre-meeting took place in a room with a carpet that had been installed to sound expensive and now only sounded tired. The Hall of Balances was one floor up, dreaming of midnight. Here, in a chamber meant for arbitration, the chairs had arms as if everyone who sat in them was expected to need help getting up. The mayor sat with both palms on the table, a man who had learned to pray to his own skin. The Cultural Affairs woman had a legal pad with sections blocked off by color and an expression like a good mother at a bad school play. Hart took a seat where he could see the door and the ceiling and the farthest corner, because some men keep their own fire codes. Lark arrived late and carried under his arm a rolled print of a ledger page that had once told a village when to stop borrowing against its children. The simian contingent entered as a band would: the mandrill wearing nothing that pretended clothes but everything that pretended audience, the juvenile rhesus with hair slicked in a gesture someone had taught him without thinking, the chimp with sorrow in the face like a permanent winter.\n\n\u201cWe thank you for the hour,\u201d the mayor said without preamble, which was, in itself, preamble. \u201cWe thank you for avoiding the Clause. We also have to name what a great many of my defenders are calling the danger of softness. The rite is now a thing, whatever the Rite Advisory Council wants to say. We have to specify what it contains so it becomes an instrument rather than a mood.\u201d\n\n\u201cComponents,\u201d the Cultural Affairs woman said, and looked, despite herself, at the mandrill. \u201cWe should formalize a list, specific and symbolic. The list would be published and then lied about and then re-published and stuck to anyway. The list would include paper, ink, salt, air, the presence of witnesses, the use of the seal, the placement of the bowl, the destruction of records that should be destroyed and the protection of those that shouldn\u2019t. It should not include any human parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cHair,\u201d the rhesus said, and the room turned to him as if the word were a bell. He touched his head where his mother or someone had smoothed his crown. \u201cYou shave your head,\u201d he added, and pointed at Ephraim with the grave cruelty of a boy imitating his elders. \u201cUncle\u2019s hair. It grows again. We get to laugh. We get to keep a thing that feels like a tooth without blood. The old ones care about hair.\u201d\n\nHart leaned in as if he wished he had a foil. \u201cHe keeps it short,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cMonkeys pull.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we cut his eyebrows,\u201d the rhesus said with a seriousness that made two aides from the budget office cough into their sleeves to hide the automatic laughter. The mandrill did not smile, and the rhesus blushed under his fur and dropped his eyes and then looked proud of his own humiliation, which is a trick with monkeys and with men.\n\n\u201cNo human is shaved,\u201d Miriam said from the back, because the door had not been guarded against sisters and she had her coat on like armor. \u201cNo human is plucked. You want hair, we bring you hair from the brush of a city\u2019s dogs. We bring you hair from sheep that never asked to be citizens but paid taxes in a way that tasted better. You want a token, we hang a wreath of hair at the door and call it an old custom. You don\u2019t take the face of a man and make it your proof of power.\u201d\n\nThe mandrill watched her the way cliffs watch the sea\u2014without moving and with complete attention. \u201cI will not chew his face,\u201d she said with a dryness that qualified as charity. \u201cI do not like the taste of spite. But I want a change that you cannot launder with paper.\u201d She tapped the table once with the nail of her index finger, a gesture so human it made the room\u2019s skin prickle. \u201cYou will drown a ledger and call it blood, and I will nod, and the little ones will dance, and the old ones will say the city is clever but is it honest. I want one honest thing. It does not have to be painful. It has to be irreversible.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecord erasure,\u201d Lark said quietly, as if saying a slur. He unrolled the print and weighed down its edges with four glass paperweights shaped like apples that someone had given the city when it still believed learning could stop grief. \u201cThere is a category in the oldest books called the Feast of Closure. It is what we did when we knew the line had become a snake. You write a name that should never have been on the page and you take a knife and cut the strip of parchment and you feed the strip to the goats and you let the goats move through the city and everyone who sees them laughs and says We have eaten the shame. We do not erase the wrong; we move it into a stomach and then we move it out of the city. We can do it. We have printers and we have goats. We have a river instead of a drought. We can drown the wrong line and let it go thinner than guilt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat line,\u201d the mayor asked, and he looked at Ephraim because a mayor is a man paid to demand specifics from metaphors.\n\n\u201cUncle\u2019s Tithe entries,\u201d Ephraim said. His mouth did the thing flesh does when it accepts that it must constitute speech. \u201cEvery instance. Every alias. Every hand that moved it from one column to another. We print those pages on heavy paper and we bring them to the Hall and we cut the lines and we lay the strips in the bowl and if a monkey wants to eat a name they can eat that name. Then we drown the rest in the river with witnesses. Then we stamp the ledger with the seal that says closed and we pay whoever expects money with the thing they deserve, which is apology and an invoice for integer theft.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrowning records is a tenderness,\u201d the Cultural Affairs woman said, and the sentence had both admiration and warning braided together. \u201cIt is also a crime. The State will call it tampering. A future grand jury will call it erasure. A historian will call it a theft of woods from a future fireplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cA crime measured against what,\u201d Miriam asked. She had found a chair that did not require anyone\u2019s permission and sat in it like a stone sits. \u201cAgainst the clause that says we make the city an icicle. Against the habit that wants to make my family into scenery. Against the men who wrote components and didn\u2019t say out loud what their teeth were doing. Proceed to call it a crime. I will testify. I will bring a basket of olives to the dock and pass them to the jurors while they decide if they would rather breathe or read.\u201d\n\nThe chimp made a sound that was not language but in that room felt like a word that had not yet been invented. The mandrill nodded, as if to an equal. \u201cGoats,\u201d she said. She made the g sound in her throat like a machine warming. \u201cBring the goats. Bring the hair. Bring the bowl and the paper and the numbers the goat will wear out of the city. We will teach the little ones the song for letting go of a delicious cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have goats,\u201d the mayor said, which was the first time he had admitted in public that there was something he could not procure with a phone. He looked at Hart, who spread his hands as if to say his marketing list did not currently include caprines.\n\n\u201cI know a man who rents goats to clear lots,\u201d Rory said, in the voice of a child who has chosen to save the family by making a phone call the adults cannot quite imagine. \u201cHe filmed me once when I filmed the goats eating poison ivy, and he owes me a favor. He will need to be paid and he will need the city to pretend his goats are insured. I can get him to the Hall if we promise him the goats will be beloved for a night.\u201d\n\nThe Cultural Affairs woman wrote GOATS in a square that she had thought would say FLOW. She drew a little face on the g that looked like it wanted to bite a mayor. \u201cWe are making a secular liturgy by committee,\u201d she said, and sniffed, not because she was moved but because the dust in the room had courage. \u201cWe will need to control the river access. We will need to choreograph the drowning. We will need to talk with Public Works about how to remove soggy paper without choking the fish. We will need to convince the television trucks that this is grim and not cute. We will need to convince the hobby faction that this is not a parade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another thing,\u201d Hart said, and his voice had put down its lightness like a coat. \u201cIf you drown the wrongs and cut the lines and eat the names and shave no one, you still have men with an interest in the Clause. You have one or two who maybe liked the knife because it made the city behave. You have somebody who wrote those sugar letters. They will try to shift the ritual back toward pain because pain is a better anchor for a habit. They will engineer a failure. They will trip a switch. They will pay a boy to push a red button shaped like a toy. They will convince a monkey to light a flame under a thing that reads where it isn\u2019t supposed to. They will say the paper does not taste good anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will try contingency Theta on a Tuesday,\u201d the Cultural Affairs woman said, and looked like a woman ordering a drink she knows will be flat. \u201cThey will say there was a leak. They will say the festival kept the trucks from the gate. They will translate physics into malice. We have two weeks, and then their patience will convert to geometry. We need redundancies they can\u2019t undo with a small wickedness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stage an extra rite,\u201d Lark said. He had unrolled another print without confessing he\u2019d brought it. \u201cNot a show. A village thing. Quiet. The old accountants called them attestations. You make a line of people and each holds the ledger and breathes on it. You count the breaths. You mark the breath with ash and oil so the air learns to stick. You take the total to the plant and you give it to the man with the stutter and you say, We breathed this many times for you, and he nods and he feels like a man whose house was circled by the town at night so the wolves would hear footsteps and leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreath as component,\u201d the mayor said, and for the first time that day looked like someone who might have been a person before the word mayor had nailed his head to the building. \u201cBreath as a number. We can issue a certificate of breath. We can accept or reject in triplicate. We can make a pile of inhalations a thing you can drive trucks on.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not issue,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cDo not monetize. Do not let it be a stamp you can buy. Let it be a line in the ledger no one is allowed to round. Let it be done in the alley, at the plant fences, in kitchens, at the Hall, in barber chairs, on buses that still stop, in the cannery dock on the three nights it isn\u2019t trying to be a cathedral. Let no one own it. Let everyone know it happened.\u201d\n\nThey argued another hour because argument is how you bind a plan to a city that resists being bound. In the end, they wrote down: paper, ink, bowl, goats, hair wreath, ledger drowning, breath, witnesses, olives. They wrote: no blood, no hair from any human face, no children near the knife even if it is a prop. They wrote: mandate laughter, forbid jeering at the wrong moments, allow singing in two keys, prohibit plastic knives. They wrote: contingency Epsilon\u2014open every bridge manually with men pulling chains if the power goes. They wrote: call the plant every twenty-seven minutes like a man calling a lover who lives alone.\n\nOn the way out, in the corridor where the walls carried the hung faces of former financial officers whose eyes had been made of that cheap varnish that makes sorrow waterproof, the mandrill stopped beside Ephraim and watched her reflection in the glass of a framed certificate that had lost its meaning when the city had given new jobs to different sins. \u201cYou will stand on the pallet again,\u201d she said. It was not a question and it did not taste like command. \u201cYou will let them watch you cut the line. They will mark the angle of your elbow and make it a fashion. They will want to kiss your hand and bite your wrist. You will learn to keep your hands in your pockets.\u201d She leaned closer and he smelled the old fruit on her breath, sweet and wrong. \u201cWhen they ask you to say the boy\u2019s name, you will say instead the word ledger until it becomes a person, and then you will say the word city until it becomes an animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not brave,\u201d he said, which has the advantage of sounding like humility and the disadvantage of being true.\n\n\u201cYou are useful,\u201d she said. \u201cUsefulness is a courage cities understand. Also you made something I could eat when all the men wanted was a scream. I am not sure if that makes you priest or cook. Either way, you owe me a napkin.\u201d\n\nOn the steps outside, a troop had invented a new sport: eating substitute scrip while doing handstands. A rhesus fell and laughed because pain performed is a kind of currency. The capuchin with the bandaged ear presented itself with a solemnity that had been missing for months and handed him a folded piece of glossy paper with an image on it that had been cut from a magazine. It was an advertisement for a winter festival in a far city where the snow fell the old way. \u201cWe don\u2019t like bright snow,\u201d the capuchin said, as if confessing a shame. \u201cIt tastes like cleaning. It gets in the fur and makes the babies cough. We like dirty snow that tells you what everyone stepped in. If you do the thing with goats, I will throw rocks at anyone who tries to throw rocks at the goats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Ephraim said, and meant it in the way you mean it when a thing whose teeth scare you offers its teeth to your defense.\n\nThe week bent itself into preparations the way wire remembers a shape when you twist it. Rory filmed people breathing on paper for Lark\u2019s attestation archive, and he did it with such a tenderness the air around the subjects seemed to thicken. He cut a tutorial about refusal that moved like a disease and was greeted on phones by faces who had learned to open every link with suspicion. There was a shot of the bowl filling with names he had found in the sewer of the budget; there was a shot of a dog shedding while a hand collected the hair; there was a shot of a goat chewing an invoice with the concentration of a monk; there was a shot of Miriam on her stoop, solemn as a gate, speaking the line We eat the paper and keep the breath as if it were a recipe her mother had taught her at the sink. He watched it back and cut and cut until the film did the thing he had promised: it taught a city a muscle.\n\nHart secured the goats with a mixture of charm and a check that would bounce only if two more fires happened. Darla acquired the hair wreath with an efficiency that made everyone understand she had been waiting all her life to deliver a relic. She had a cousin in a grooming shop who thought the city was a halting romance with a dog and who took it as a point of pride to build a wreath big enough to shame a doorway. The Cultural Affairs woman wrangled the agency list until every page had a phone number in the upper right corner and a person next to it who would actually pick up. The mayor practiced not saying nephew in a mirror and practiced saying ledger with the gravity of a man saying his own name.\n\nThe sugar letters did not stop. One arrived tucked into a loaf at the bakery that had begun to bake at night with the doors open so smell could be a resource. It said, in that careful bookstore hand, You are staining the city with cowardice. It said, Eat the child and be done. It said, We have been told we only need once, and after once history grows a rind and cannot be cut. It smelled like cinnamon, which made the threat feel cozy in a way that would be funny if it were not a rehearsal of doom. Another was slid into the slit of his office door during the hour the monkeys turned the tenth floor into a squeal. It bore only a date and a drawing of a knife that had a shadow. He put both notes in the refrigerator because the cold had become the place where he put ideas that wanted to ripen into wrong.\n\nTwo days before the moon\u2019s appointment, there was a test of the breath ritual that went badly in the way practice must sometimes fail to save you later. In an alley behind the plant, a line of men and women and one child who had decided to be brave in her own way held the ledger and breathed and counted and marked a page with ash. A rhesus youth who had joined them the way birds join a flock when it moves toward something interesting took a marker and drew a mustache on the number 8. The child laughed, and the laugh echoed, and the echo sounded like jeering, and the men behind the fence looked up as if someone had thrown a stone. It took ten minutes to untangle the meanings, and when it was done a human woman and a monkey child cried for the same length of time without looking at each other, and someone said it was a rehearsal and someone else said it was a warning, and Lark wrote in a notebook with pleasure because his profession records pain with a gratitude that sometimes embarrasses him into softness.\n\nOn the eve, the city staged a different kind of riot: a rumor that the goats had escaped and were eating the flower beds in front of the municipal court. It was true in the way things are true when goats stand where men are used to standing and look more dignified than any argument. The court custodians came out and offered them salt on their palms like sacrifices to a myth that lacked a theologian. A troop of macaques in high-visibility vests set up sawhorses around the flower beds as if the goats were a crucial repair. People applauded. A man in a business suit tried to lecture a goat on the dangers of symbolism and the goat turned its head and sneezed spinach on his shoes. The mandrill watched from a step and looked pleased in a way that made It impossible to tell if she was approving of goats or of the ease with which animals made human fidelity look silly.\n\nThat night, a transformer somewhere that had been waiting to defend its honor finally chose to die. The neighborhoods flickered in a pattern that suggested a man\u2019s heart in an arrhythmia. In the short dark, a fight broke out under the viaduct where a man was sure his car had been blessed by an invisible authority to ignore certain lines. The monkeys yelled and then mediated and then yelled again. At the cannery, the pallets stood blank in the light of portable floodlamps, which looked like moons mounted on tripods and turned to face an audience that had not arrived. The Cultural Affairs woman walked the perimeter, counting under her breath as if a word repeated often enough can become an obstacle you can place in front of catastrophe.\n\nHe slept lightly, because the city had trained him to wake when verbs happen. When the hour came\u2014the mean hour, the one that had enjoyed a reputation in older stories\u2014he put on his jacket and his shirtsleeves did not quarrel with him, and he checked his pockets for the things you bring to a rite: a pen, a small folded photograph he did not let himself look at because he knew exactly what it contained, a list of names printed from the ledger like a tendon from a bone, and a coin from his mother\u2019s jar because she had always believed the world lets you pass if you carry something that understands the value of weight.\n\nOutside, the night had put on its formal shoes. The air carried a smell that could have been frost if the city weren\u2019t too warm at its core for that. Monkeys lined wires. People lined sidewalks. Goats rode in the back of a truck with a patient grace that made Ephraim want to be better at what he had chosen to be. Miriam walked beside him with a basket of olives as if she were a woman in a painting that has always existed. Rory walked backwards, filming and not tripping, and every now and then he blew gently on his lens, as if fog could be dissuaded with polite breath. Hart walked behind with Darla talking him into not kicking a traffic cone that had been placed to look like a hat.\n\nInside the Hall of Balances, they had made a spectacle out of sobriety. The bowl sat on the table like a mouth that had learned to close. The hair wreath hung on the door, ridiculous and perfect. The ledger rested on a stand that had been built by Public Works out of old stair treads so that it felt like a book that had done labor all its life. The mayor stood with his hand already on the pen as if he were ready to sign away the whole city if someone told him a good story. The mandrill perched on a chair and did not resemble a human and therefore looked more like one.\n\nThe juvenile rhesus announced himself by tripping and recovering in a way that made everyone who had ever had a body feel for him, and then he puffed his chest because it is the right of the young to believe in their faces. The chimp went to a window and stared at his own dark reflection and put a hand to the glass where his chest was as if swearing to a god who lives in panes. The Cultural Affairs woman did a headcount and used a pencil to write yes next to everything that would later be rewritten as no.\n\nEphraim stepped to the pallet they had brought in because the city now loved a stage. He set the ledger on its stand, and he felt the book\u2019s spine with his palm the way men touch animals to comfort them. The first page he opened to was an old one, a page that had survived damp and hands. It carried a number he knew by its posture. He cut the line with the municipal knife, which had the decency to be dull, and he laid the thin strip of white into the bowl, and it landed like a small fall forgiven. He did not say nephew. He said ledger once, then ledger again, then ledger until the word lost its meaning and became a sound like wood in a wind. The mandrill watched and did not blink until he had laid three strips and then she looked up and out the window as if to be sure no bright snow was falling from a sky that had never promised to behave.\n\nThey cut and they laid and they breathed. They took the breath into the book the way a poor man takes food into the house by standing outside and thinking hard about soup. They passed the ledger to the mayor and he breathed and failed to look ridiculous, which is the hardest thing a mayor does. They passed it to the rhesus and he breathed and made it a game and then took the game seriously, and when he handed it to the chimp the chimp held it with two hands and breathed a breath that shook the stand. Lark stood to the side and made the notes a scholar makes when he knows his book will be footnoted by the hungry.\n\nWhen the bowl was heavy enough that the table creaked, they lifted it together and carried it to the door. The hair wreath brushed Ephraim\u2019s shoulder and left against his jacket a softness that would stay past washing. Outside, the goats stamped, impatient in the dignity of animals you have asked to symbolize. The crowd parted. The monkeys in the trees quieted with the concentration of children learning a bad word they intend to deploy sparingly. They carried the bowl down the steps and out toward the river, and every few feet someone put their hand to the bowl\u2019s lip as if to steady it or to bless it. A rhesus leapt down and licked the rim, and a woman in a coat that had belonged to her mother slapped his hand away and then let him hold her shoulder for balance as he smiled at being told no.\n\nAt the river, in the place where the cannery had learned to resemble a Cathedral and then learned to suppose it might be a warehouse again, they set the bowl on the wall and lifted. The paper slid in a single gelatinous mass and hit the water with a sound like many small pages agreeing to let go. The current took it and did not choke. The goats, whose owner had insisted on being called by his first name as if goats were above titles, stepped forward with ceremony and chewed the strips that had stuck to the rim with a focus that made the whole act look like a psalm. People cried in the way of men who have decided crying is the tax for still being here.\n\nAfter the bowl, there were names to eat and names to drown and names to refuse. He looked once at the list and saw his own printed in a column that was not meant for eating, and for a second his body thought it would have to learn a new verb. He put his finger on his name and then put the page face down. When the bowl was empty and the water had carried its lint upriver to the place where sewage is turned into something less insulting, someone began to sing the paper chant. Someone else sang a different song, about something that happened in a valley far away. The songs braided and did not quarrel.\n\nIt was almost too smooth. He knew enough about the city to distrust clean. The smooth broke at the edge of the crowd where a boy with a face that would someday be a man\u2019s wore a hooded sweatshirt with the hood up in a way that made his mother invisible. He lifted a bottle from his sleeve with the shame of someone who had been asked to be a knife and wanted to prove he could cut in public. The capuchin with the bandage saw him first because the world owed him that moment. The monkey moved like the small version of mercy and put its hand on the boy\u2019s wrist with a gentleness that made the wrist remember it belonged to someone who had once held a spoon. The boy looked down and the capuchin looked up and they both looked sideways where a man with a municipal badge had stood on a landing and read a notice. The boy put the bottle back. The capuchin took the boy\u2019s hood and pulled it off, which is the monkey way of shaving a head. The crowd put out the breath it had been holding and then took another.\n\nWhen it was over, the Cultural Affairs woman adjusted the note she had written to herself about the timing of goats. The mayor went home and sat on the edge of his bed and looked at his feet until the alarm clock, which had been set because the city requires a man with a title to observe the morning, told him to stand. Lark went back to his office and laid his hands on the bone stick and felt for a splinter and found none. Hart went to a bar that had become a room where guilt performed itself on ice and told a joke that made three men swear they would stop hating him and then left without saying goodnight because some kinds of happiness must be managed alone. Rory went home with his mother and cut a version of the night that did not have Ephraim in it at all and sent it to a list of addresses with the subject line Watch This To Learn A Mouth. Miriam lay on her bed and cried without letting her throat make a sound because some sounds are owed to different days. The mandrill slept on a roof curled around a heat vent like a poor god and dreamed of a river that speaks.\n\nEphraim counted. He counted trucks. He counted the breaths that had been taken and were now scattered in lungs and along the river, in the goats\u2019 bellies, in the bowl with its rim salt-bitter on the tongue. He counted the futures he had bought and the ones he had not yet been asked to save. He counted the days until a fortnight. He counted the letters in the word components and the letters in the word breath and tried to accept that they were not the same and never would be. He put his head on his ledger and listened for a heartbeat and found a rustle that could be paper or could be a small animal settling. He closed his eyes because morning had declared itself and because men like him do not sleep; they adjourn.\n\nThe morning came with the small cruelty of details. The plant reported the gauges in the green and the engineer with the stutter sent a message that said Thank and then stopped because the word you is heavy and he had no one to lift it to. The Ritual Advisory Council issued a statement denying it existed and praising the goats for their service to public morale. The paper ran a headline that had been designed the day before and tweaked at dawn: Ledger Drowned; City Breathes. The SENSEFUL STREETS group put out a poster with a goat drawn badly and a speech bubble that said Accounting Is For Carnivores. A troupe of spider monkeys demonstrated, under a traffic light that had given up, how to cut paper without cutting fingers and the fifth monkey bled anyway and laughed because the city required it.\n\nAt noon, the sugar letter arrived not at his apartment, not at the office, but in the hands of the capuchin on the tram. The monkey did not joke. It put the paper into Ephraim\u2019s hand with a dead seriousness that felt like a ceremony. He unfolded it because you cannot refuse an oar when you are in water. The hand was the same careful hand, the ink the same cheap kind. It said, in a smaller, more cramped line, We are not satisfied with paper and goats. This is large arithmetic. The thing in the south is greedy. The bright snow is a clause you do not control. In fourteen nights, the winter comes if the appetite is not met. It smelled not of sugar but of ash, and the ash tasted, when he licked his finger and touched it, like the inside of a matchbook.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do,\u201d the capuchin asked, as if it were begging him to say something human. \u201cWho do we bite if biting does not fix the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe buy more time,\u201d he said, because a man in his job ends every sentence that way. \u201cWe do not let them put a mouth on the wrong thing. We keep the bridges open. We breathe until the numbers change. We ask the river to help and we give it everything we have that is not a boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumbers are bones,\u201d the capuchin said solemnly, as if remembering something he had learned from a woman with a scarf and a boy with blue hair. \u201cWe can throw bones to dogs and the dogs will be happy. We cannot throw bones to winter. Winter wants houses.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. The tram swayed. The girl with the calculus book underlined something with a pencil that had lost its eraser and then looked out the window at a sign where someone had painted over the word STOP with the words KEEP BREATHING. He wrote the last line of the sugar letter into his pocket ledger because you must write down the words that try to command you so that they are subject to a list. He closed the book and put his hand over it like a lid because some days you give your stomach a little win and pretend it is a strategy.\n\nThat night, when he unlocked his door, there was a smell he could not place. It was not gas, it was not bread, it was not the candle from a woman who wielded theater like a wrench. It was a sweetness that had gone bad without spoiling. He followed it down the hall and found the refrigerator ajar. Inside, where he had been keeping the notes chilled like fish you swear you will not cook, there was no paper. There was a hole in the frost where paper edges had been. There was a single olive he had not put there. He touched the olive with his forefinger. It had a bite gone from it. On the inside of the refrigerator door, someone had drawn a mouth with a marker in the wrong hand. The mouth had a tongue. The tongue extended, as jokes sometimes do, too far. He shut the door and the bulb went dark and he stood with his hand on the handle and decided, again, that he would not decide today. He would decide tomorrow, which is to say he would have to decide tonight in secret and hope morning would be fooled.\n\nOn his chair, someone had left a book. It was the old kind, the smell of a basement and a church and a stack of winter sweaters. The title had rubbed off except for the word Accounts. Inside, on the first page, in a grandmother hand, a sentence: If we must count, we will count with our mouths closed. He sat with it and the night annoyed the window and somewhere a monkey laughed and somewhere a man wept and somewhere a machine thought it would be a beautiful thing to break. He closed his own mouth and held his breath until his chest said please and then he let it out slowly and wrote the number one on the blank next page without ink. He pressed so hard the paper dented, which is one way a city survives.Chapter 10\n\nHe woke in the thin light to the smell the refrigerator had left behind, a sweetness turned cynical, and opened the door as if he might catch the culprit before it had a chance to choose a different home. The notes were gone, the olive with the bite still sat in its ridiculous solitude, and the drawn mouth on the inside door looked smug in the way that only ink can look when it thinks it has made a point. He wiped the marker mouth away with the rough side of a sponge and thought of the phrase clean slate and how it never once in his life had meant clean. He made coffee the way a man fortifies himself for a conversation he cannot win, pressed his thumb into the dent he had written on his own page the night before, and felt how the paper fought back gently, not a refusal so much as a reminder that even fibrous things have a spine.\n\nHart let himself into the office without knocking, which had become his way of loving people in a crisis, and stood by the window with his tie looped once and then given up on, as if it were a sentence that had found it had said enough. \u201cWe have twelve days,\u201d he said without preface, as if they were both mid-prayer and had forgotten to fold their hands. \u201cWe have trucks that think they are shy and a plant that wants lullabies and a Council that has translated appetite into font size. We have bridges that remember what men with chains were for.\u201d He slapped a paper on the desk that had been printed with a municipal seriousness that tried to make itself appear inevitable. \u201cEpsilon, manual. Darla blessed it with her highlighter. She found you the names of the men who still teach chains to listen. They keep the keys in a locker labeled \u2018Mascots\u2019 because the city is embarrassed by muscle.\u201d\n\nThe GIS analyst called on a channel so quiet it sounded as if she were phoning through cloth. \u201cI taught the map a new word,\u201d she said. \u201cTheta. The overlay insists on turning the vanishing tooth into a mouth again on nights when our power lines dream of their childhood. 999 Cherry\u2019s ghost is back, not as a building but as a route. The overlay says Bright Bridges Temporary will run a convoy through the cannery at the hour of doubt. They renamed the truck icon \u2018festival.\u2019 It\u2019s a whim and a lie and a plan.\u201d She mailed him the picture and he watched the gray block ghost in and out, learned its rhythm, counted the intervals the way a woman counts contractions when she wants time to behave.\n\nLark arrived with a rabbit-warren of rolled paper and the bone tally like a wand he had refused a job in a children\u2019s movie to keep. He set the maps on the desk and weighed their corners with staplers because scholars are the only men left who have weights handy. \u201cAttestations moved out of the churchy spaces,\u201d he said with a cheer he refused to name grief. \u201cWe\u2019ve got breath on paper from nine wards and a stray from the airport. Teens are breathing on the backs of their math homework because they like the wrongness. They\u2019re turning the breath page over to see the ghost of their equations and they think that\u2019s magic. It is, a little. Rory\u2019s piece taught them a mouth. They are doing it without the music sometimes and sometimes with, and the monkeys are watching and trying the count on their fingers and pretending they don\u2019t care when the number five licks their brain.\u201d He held up a page dented with a hundred patient exhales and said very softly, to himself, \u201cThat ought to be worth a chain.\u201d\n\nAt the plant the engineer with the stutter met him with a spoon he had wrapped in a paper towel as if it were an heirloom. \u201cThey put gum on the valve,\u201d he said, the g of gum heavy, and Ephraim thought of boys in alleys and wives with black aprons and monkeys with nothing to do and all of the city\u2019s fingers pressed into mistakes. \u201cI don\u2019t know who. I don\u2019t ask. I scraped it with this. My mother said never throw away a spoon that fits your hand. I might be arrested for saying it, but I want you to have it.\u201d The spoon\u2019s bowl had a notch worn by soup and by time. It felt like a tongue trying to make a number better by tasting it. He slid it into his jacket pocket with a care that was not for metal but for the stories that choose to hitch a ride there.\n\nThe Cultural Affairs woman asked for a walk by the river and did not light a candle. \u201cBe practical,\u201d she said, and then laughed at herself because she sounded like a person who sells pillows. \u201cMy deputy\u2014June\u2014put ash on the notes with a finger she dipped in an old tin I keep on my desk for emergencies and ghosts. She wrote them on my paper with my pen and wept about you in the bathroom because she was ashamed of doing the thing she thought would save the city. She is not a villain. She is an employee with a daughter named May, and the world told her that if you do not make the ritual strong you get winter for dessert.\u201d The apology sat between them like a dog that had learned it was allowed on furniture now. \u201cI removed her from the line where words turn to summonses,\u201d she added. \u201cI did not fire her because the city might need later the kind of woman who can smell when the floor is going to give.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does Theta buy,\u201d he asked. He watched a cormorant go under as if it had seen a ledger in the water it needed to balance.\n\n\u201cLeverage,\u201d she said, adjusting her scarf as if she could arrange her soul with wool. \u201cInsurers hold it. A contractor whose trucks have cherries on them holds it. A lobbyist who can make the word contingency sound like a meal holds it. Theta is a club over our head. Every hour we buy by making a meal out of paper, they will try to sell back to us at markup. We\u2019re paying an interest rate in fear. The clause isn\u2019t a law. It\u2019s a mood at a conference table. I\u2019m saying this out loud because we are running out of time to tell the truth in full sentences.\u201d\n\nHe went to Miriam for the part of this kind of day where you allow something to be obvious in front of someone who won\u2019t sell it. She had pulled the curtains half-closed so the apartment looked like a memory of itself. \u201cIrreversible,\u201d she said, serving him a pear on a plate that had belonged to their grandmother so old it had wood in it. \u201cThe mandrill asked for something we can\u2019t walk back. I thought of shaving my head and decided I\u2019m not sentimental about hair in that direction. I thought of taking the sign off the countinghouse and writing museum in chalk so it could be erased. I thought of writing uncle on the ground outside the Hall and rubbing it out with my heel until the word cried. Then I thought of olive pits, which do a sneaky thing with permanence. You eat the olive. You spit the pit. The pit lingers on the ground making promises. I want to make a pit with the city. Something we plant.\u201d She stabbed the pear with her knife in a way that made the pear feel like victory and then pulled back because she saw his face. \u201cWe could shut a lane that leads to the cannery forever and make it a strip of garden,\u201d she said more gently. \u201cA literal barrier between the pallets and the street. They can\u2019t drive vans through a trellis if the trellis holds beans.\u201d\n\nThe mandrill held court on a library roof, because monkeys choose their rooms by the quality of ledges, and listened to her cousins\u2019 arguments with a kind of patient boredom that told you she had learned more than you thought from watching committees. The juvenile rhesus, feeling the moon fatten whether or not he believed in it, insisted on eyebrows again with an affection that made his rudeness almost lovely. The chimp rapped his knuckles on the skylight and stared into the reading room where three humans had fallen asleep with newspapers on their faces, and the mandrill said in her old-longshoreman voice that hair wreaths hung at every door would satisfy the old ones for a season if they smelled like dog and if the wreaths were taken to the river after. She said, too, that if anyone cut a girl\u2019s hair without asking, she would bite them on the hand so that the scar would be a reason forever not to do it again. The rhesus nodded solemnly like a page accepting a task, and then, being fifteen in spirit, attempted to steal a bookmark from a man below and failed twice and then succeeded once and felt the holy thrill of trivial theft.\n\nThey built a list and then they built a practice. Darla printed, stamped, collated, and put her lipstick on with a steadiness that made all the red in the city look like a promise and not a threat. She made \u201cbreath cards\u201d that were not cards, just paper heavy enough to take a fingernail, and the fingernail left a clear mark that no one could erase without cutting the page. She assigned runners to the bridges and scheduled calls as if scheduling were prayer. Hart found the goat man leaning on a fence talking softly to an animal who did not need human words and made him promise three times that he would accept apples and not ask for changes in the law as payment. The goat man, whose name was Salim and who owned two pairs of socks that had learned to love mud, agreed to bring the cleanest, hungriest mouths in the city to the Hall for a second contract of silence.\n\nThe night sent an emissary to him in the form of a woman sitting on the cannery steps with her shoes off and her stockings rolled around her ankles like two different regrets. June, the deputy, did not stand when he stopped. She offered him a cigarette she did not light as if she were making a joke for a movie that liked to show competence as ruin. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry enough,\u201d she said plainly. \u201cI wrote the notes because in every meeting I sat in men made euphemisms until I wanted to drag my face on carpet. I thought if I put the fear in pretty, you\u2019d obey the pretty. It worked and it didn\u2019t. It always works and it never does. I\u2019m fired in the way that keeps my health insurance, which is how this city breaks your heart without technically doing anything wrong.\u201d She lifted her head. \u201cTheta isn\u2019t just a clause. It\u2019s a specific mischief. There are three warehouses with tanks that would behave like a bad winter if they were convinced it was their time. Two are guarded. One is watched by a man who plays cards with our enemies. He\u2019s not a villain either. He\u2019s lonely.\u201d She slid him a list folded so tight he needed his thumbnail to pry it open. \u201cThere is so much to guard that we will fail. There is, maybe, just enough to love that the failure will not be the kind that steals breath. Do not forgive me now. I don\u2019t want to write that scene.\u201d\n\nOn the last day before the moon did its old theater, the city performed a blasphemous rehearsal. Powder fell from a rooftop along a block in the Ward with the broken clock, tossed from five-gallon buckets by boys who had been promised a hardness by a man on a phone who had never once stood and watched a sky remember how to behave. The powder wreathed the block and tongues found it the way tongues find worry. The monkeys shrieked and then acted sick and then laughed and then were still, which was the strangest part. Hydrants were opened by men who had pulled their whole lives and watched the pretend ash turn to paste that never forgot its baptism. A goat wandered in from a lot and licked the paste with a look of someone willing to try any food once. The powder turned the goat\u2019s chin gray. The goat shook its head, sneezed, and trotted away with an air of disappointment that read like an editorial. The men with the buckets watched their theater melt and did not clap. The Cultural Affairs woman arrived with a mop and the mayor with a rolled-up plan he forgot to unfurl and the mandrill with her jaw tight. \u201cYou think snow is cheap,\u201d she said to no one and everyone. \u201cWait until you have to sweep.\u201d Ephraim wrote in his ledger: practice panic, sweep, kebab for the men who opened the valves, no notes.\n\nHarvest night came dressed as itself. The moon had the confidence of an elder who has outlived everybody\u2019s taste. The Hall of Balances smelled like unwashed wool and ink. The wreath on the door looked foolish until it didn\u2019t. The bowl glared, which is a trick bowls know. The ledger lay open to the part where deceit narrows like a river into usable pain. The goat man stood by with his hand on his favorite\u2019s head, and the favorite looked at him with a devotion so stupid it could save a family from a fire. The bridges waited for chains and hands. Public Works checked the manual cranks with banana fingers in gloves. The monkeys took their places in different trees than last time as if to test the city\u2019s reflexes.\n\nThey did not speak the boy\u2019s name. They did not even say boy. The mayor said ledger and saw that nobody flinched and then said ledger again softly as if it were a lullaby his mother might have hummed if the world had been something else. Ephraim cut the lines and laid them in the bowl. Each strip of paper seemed to say please, and he could not tell if the paper begged to be eaten or to be spared the indignity of metaphor. Miriam stood in the back with olives and made a face like a gate that keeps. Lark made the cross of someone else\u2019s religion over the bone tally and told it under his breath that it was doing very well. The mandrill watched and breathed only when the chimp breathed, as if to braid the act into a rope that might hold more than animal.\n\nThe powder-droppers, having been humiliated by hydrants, tried again in a subtler place, the roof of the post office where the city hides the letters that hurt. The capuchin who had stolen a stapler days before used it to hit the elbow of the boy about to spill and said, in a tone of casual companionship, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The boy\u2019s face did the quick arithmetic of dignity; he looked at the city, the moon, his own hand, and then he put the bucket down and sat with his legs over the edge so that everyone who looked up had to consider human ankles. It was not heroism. It was posture re-taught.\n\nWhen the bowl was full enough that the rim tasted like kale, they carried it out. A woman tripped and a man caught her under the elbow and she kissed him without thinking as if luck had to be thanked with mouth. The goats ate the names they were given and let the rest go river. Chains clanked on three bridges and the fourth refused because it had pride and a bad hinge, and four men with hands like history pulled anyway while a troop of rhesus threw their bodies on the chain and felt a pleasure that the city could have used for different things if it had had the time. South, the plant clicked its clicks and the engineer counted, and a figure on a walkway at Warehouse Three, the one with the lonely man, put his phone away and lit a cigarette instead and told himself a story about his daughter in another place and the time he would tell her a story that made him look like a man.\n\nIn the Hall someone whispered nephew because there is always a person who insists on touching a hot stove, and the mandrill flicked her ear and a silence fell so sudden it felt like a new weather. The word hung a second and then died the way small fires die when rain picks a neighborhood to love. Hart laughed once under his breath as if he had seen an old joke learn manners. Darla distributed breath cards and told people sternly where to put their nail, and people obeyed because the sternness was full of love and because she had a face the city had agreed not to lie to. The Cultural Affairs woman watched the juvenile rhesus mouth the word ledger and shook like a girl who had rescued a dog from a road and was only now allowed to feel it.\n\nThe counter-rite played itself under a streetlight four blocks away, plastic knifery and a poster of a boy borrowed from somewhere that had nothing to do with this city. The crowd did not boo. It turned and walked and the knives fell with the dignity of toys abandoned by toddlers. The men who had brought the knives cried because they had not planned for a script without an ending. Rory filmed them with a gentleness that had edges, and later cut it into the piece that would make people in other cities stop pretending they have no cousins.\n\nAfter the bowl and the goats and the breath there was a bench. He sat on it because he could feel the shape of himself and it needed a flat thing. The capuchin sat beside him and handed him back the spoon he had forgotten he\u2019d given it, the engineer\u2019s spoon, wrapped again in the paper towel because the monkey had learned etiquette and was proud of knowing where to put its paws. \u201cYour sister\u2019s olives were better tonight,\u201d the capuchin said, and wiped its nose with the back of its hand like a child who has been told twelve times to use a napkin. \u201cI bit two men who said they wanted to do a prank and they agreed they did not. I will not bite as a hobby. I will bite as a craft. Tell your goats they did theater without lying.\u201d\n\nHe did not go home because home had the smell of refrigerator regret. He went to the river for a while and watched the skin of the water accept and deny and accept. The moon cupped its light the way a waitress brings coffee. The city made the sound cities make when large things are done and no one died: the kind of cheering you only let the air do for you. The Cultural Affairs woman appeared like a moral at the end of a story told by someone too tired for point and sat without asking if the bench had room. \u201cJune left a note,\u201d she said. \u201cNo sugar. She wrote in pencil, hard, so it left a valley. It said: I will stop making it worse. It said: If you need me to carry boxes in the rain I can do that and never once choose a noun. I like her again because she is a person. I will tell her daughter that her mother once fed a goat an ugly word and watched it disappear.\u201d\n\nHe slept late the next morning and woke to the particular quiet of a city putting itself back on its own lap. The plant\u2019s numbers texted themselves in polite green. The bridges were open, tasting their own usefulness like a metal tongue saying grace. The goat man sent a photo of his animals in a lot under a billboard that used to sell vacations and now just sold sky, their mouths still working with dream. SENSEFUL STREETS put out a poster that corrected its goat and called the rite bourgeois, a word that had lost all meaning in the year and was now just a sound you made when your mouth wanted to feel French. The mayor said in front of microphones that the Rite Advisory Council did not exist and that its meeting was postponed to a date that would be announced when the moon had learned to mind its own business.\n\nAt Kettle & Hart, the monkeys had braided ribbons out of the substitute scrip and were using them to try to tow a chair across the floor. Darla put a hand to her mouth as if to hide a spell and then declared loudly that if anyone put their teeth on her copier she would put their head in a file drawer, and four rhesus mimed decapitation and then apologized without being asked. Hart had drawn a goat on his whiteboard and given it a speech bubble that said Pay Your Debts to Rivers. He stood with his shoes off again and said, \u201cYou stole time and fed it to something that forgot to be angry at you. That\u2019s a trick. Don\u2019t do it again unless you have to.\u201d\n\nOn the tram a woman read a story to a boy with a winter hat in a month that had no right to need hats yet. He watched her mouth shape ledger with more care than he would have thought a stranger had for his private nouns. The capuchin slept, head on his shoe, like a dog with nothing to prove. When he reached his door there was no letter. He opened the refrigerator anyway and there, where the notes had been, was a bowl of olives wrapped in waxed paper with a note in Miriam\u2019s hand that said: You still have a mouth. He stood a long time with the door open tasting the cold and the brine and the possibility that abstaining had bought him something more than just a few hours of trucks. He shut the door not with triumph but with the carefulness of a man who knows he will be asked again and wants to be ready to be the same man twice if he can manage it. He took out his ledger and, with the spoon\u2019s bowl held to the page like a tracer, impressed, with no ink at all, a second number beside the first, and then a third, because sometimes the only way to teach your hands a mercy is to let them count how many times they have chosen not to be knives.",

                              "content": "On the morning the monkeys learned how to make a siren out of a traffic cone, Ephraim Cole counted twenty-seven of them on the tram. The driver didn\u2019t stop them; the driver never stopped them anymore. A capuchin with a bandaged ear dangled from the rubber strap above Ephraim\u2019s head and spit a single sunflower seed onto the calculus text of a high school girl. The capuchin kept one eye on Ephraim\u2019s briefcase. They all did that now, like the case might open and exhale a roast chicken or a grenade.\n\n\u201cMorning, pen-chewer,\u201d the bandaged one said, voice like a pipe scraped by a wire. He had learned Ephraim\u2019s face two months ago, after the audit board forced the City to publish the monkey tickets and fines; it was still strange to be famous to the wrong species.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Ephraim said, because he never could carve a new habit for himself. Courtesy had calcified around him into a shape like a second skin, the shape of a compliant man in a tilted city.\n\n\u201cDrop that box,\u201d the monkey said, then laughed and clapped at its own joke like a cymbalist. \u201cYou drop it, we catch it, you cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t drop it,\u201d Ephraim said. The girl with the calculus text lifted her book and wiped the sunflower seed away. The driver let the tram sigh through an intersection where four macaques in orange construction vests waved plastic paddles and made obscene faces at the buses. One of the vest monkeys had a whistle; he alternated between a regulation no-noise and a ululated wolf-cry that made the pigeons on the wires throw themselves into the morning like a blanket tossed off a bed.\n\nEphraim was forty-seven years old, unmarried, with a mortgage he despised and a sister who still loved him in a way that flummoxed him. He kept his hair short because monkeys pulled hair when they were angry. He had a precise face, a precise way of walking, and a precise belief that numbers were bones and we could look through them to see the body that had walked there before. He worked at Kettle & Hart, a firm known for making the ungovernable governable until the monkeys moved in and declared governance a snack.\n\nAs the tram eased into St. Alabaster\u2019s Square, a troop of vervets jogged alongside, their tails flying like banners. One\u2014smaller, with a burn scar like a coin on its shoulder\u2014threw a handful of gravel at the windows. \u201cAudit this!\u201d the small one shouted, and then, in falsetto, \u201cWe appreciate your service!\u201d The others cackled and slapped one another\u2019s back as if applause could be traded. The bandaged capuchin tugged at the strap until the rubber groaned.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d it said. \u201cYou\u2019re late, numbers, numbers, numbers. Where\u2019s your tail? I have one.\u201d It twitched its little hook to demonstrate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not late,\u201d Ephraim said, although he was ten minutes behind, and he hated himself for the need to correct the statement. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t chew pens.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh? You chew little boys?\u201d Another cymbal-clap. A murmur from the humans in the car. Ephraim\u2019s briefcase weighed a mile. The capuchin stuck its tongue out, pale and repulsive and weirdly human at the edges. \u201cLittle boy uncle. Uncle eats, uncle eats.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop,\u201d the girl with the textbook said. Her voice had that end-of-argument tone certain teenagers carry like an extra rib. \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re art,\u201d the monkey said, and slid back out the open window as the tram doors peeled open. It was gone into the chrome and sun and diesel.\n\nOn the platform, a troupe of monkeys had stacked crates and were attempting to stand on each other\u2019s shoulders to reach a banner that read MONKEYS FOR SENSEFUL STREETS. The sign had been paid for by the Chamber of Commerce as a friendly show of support. Last week\u2019s Chamber president resigned with a rash. The crates trembled. A rhesus monkey at the bottom groaned and barfed onto the pavement. The one above him laughed, poked the vomit with a pencil, and wrote something obscene with it that looked, somehow, a little like Ephraim\u2019s name.\n\nFamiliar gooseflesh climbed Ephraim\u2019s arms as he considered turning back for home, for the toasted rye he had left on the counter and the dome of quiet around his apartment above the bakery. But he had an appointment. And also\u2014though he hardly said it even to himself\u2014it felt like quitting when people were watching. He kept moving, kept his briefcase tucked under his elbow like a heart he didn\u2019t want to hand back.\n\nKettle & Hart occupied the tenth and eleventh floors of the Gray Tower, although \u201coccupied\u201d was inaccurate: somewhere between city policy and monkey preference, the tenth floor had become a playground. No one could think why. The monkeys didn\u2019t work there; they didn\u2019t sleep there. They only hung from the fluorescent light fixtures and yowled in tight harmonies that made interns cry. They dipped their paws in the fish tank and threw guppies at the arrow plants. Someone had brought a swing\u2014someone had affixed the swing to the load-bearing crossbeam. It creaked. The building inspectors signaled a complaint, but the complaint was caught and chewed on by a gang of spider monkeys who ate vowels like potato chips.\n\n\u201cMorning, Mr. Cole,\u201d said Darla, the receptionist, as he stepped off the elevator into the lobby on eleven. She was dressed in a blouse the color of clean money, the exact tint of cash that hadn\u2019t thought about itself enough to be dirty.\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d he said. He glanced at the glass\u2014monkeys\u2019 faces were smeared into the lobby windows like thumbprints on a mirror. One made a heart with its hands when he looked. Another threw a rock.\n\nDarla slid him a folder across the counter. \u201cThe mayor\u2019s office called. Your methods are \u2018too revealing\u2019? They\u2019d like you to use fewer colors.\u201d Her mouth didn\u2019t change shape as she said it.\n\nHe opened the folder. Inside there was a memo with the City seal and the subheading Suggestions for Softer Accounting. He had invented those color graphs because they were the only way to make the river of money look like a river. He had been told repeatedly that citizens liked rivers; rivers were calming. His graphs showed the City\u2019s main channels and the tributaries: a blue torrent down the middle, a green stream for parks, a brown trickle that oozed toward rat control. And off to one side, a new canal that had opened in October, labeled Public Simian Integration Fund. It was a bright yellow that flickered as if someone had set the room on fire.\n\n\u201cFewer colors,\u201d Ephraim said. He looked up. \u201cWe\u2019re bleeding yellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to say that,\u201d Darla said. \u201cYou\u2019re not supposed to say anything that sounds like that.\u201d She leaned closer. A monkey pressed its face to the glass, cheeks flat, breath spooling a fog. \u201cYou remember you\u2019re having lunch with Miriam and Rory.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow could I forget,\u201d he said, and instantly felt the guilt that followed repeated tenderness. He liked lunch with his sister. He liked the way his nephew stole the olives. He liked the way the olives looked, too\u2014little green eyeballs in their dish, wet and ridiculous.\n\nHe made it to his office with only one interruption, a small troop of monkeys who had discovered his door and had written on it in grease pencil: FRIED ACCOUNTANT. They had drawn a crude pan. He wiped the drawing away with the sleeve of his jacket and made a mental note to stop making mental notes. It was exhausting to owe himself so much.\n\nHe loved his office still: the parquet floor stared back at him with quiet pattern; the books smelled like paper instead of panic. He opened his laptop and typed his password: abacus462!\u2014a gentle insult to himself\u2014and the spreadsheet bloomed like a forewarned flower.\n\nSix months of figures. Ticketing revenue down. Banana import tax up. Gasoline spent on chases involving motorcycle-riding macaques: up, up, uP. A curious line item from the Department of Cultural Affairs called Interprimatic Reparations: ongoing. He drilled into it. Contractor names. A nonprofit named Bright Bridges run out of an address that didn\u2019t exist: 999 Cherry Road. A series of five payments to something called Uncle\u2019s Tithe Fund. He made a fist in the air like a conductor with no orchestra. He breathed. He looked. The column said the payments had been listed not as expenses but as swaps. Assets for assets. City for time.\n\nHe called up the PDF of the original agreement that had been signed in that televised ceremony in the courthouse rotunda, the one where a female mandrill in a satin jacket had licked the microphone and the mayor had laughed like a man falling through a glass table. Reconciliation Accord, the document said. He typed a search for \u201ctithe.\u201d Nothing. But the ledger kept the unsayable like a smuggled spoon.\n\n\u201cCole,\u201d said a voice from his doorway. He turned. Mr. Hart himself leaned there like a rakish uncle in a play, a tie dangling, a grin that had browned like a banana. He was a good man in the way that a boat can be good in a storm and useless in dock.\n\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Ephraim said.\n\n\u201cColor trouble,\u201d Hart said, and whistled through his teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t soften for them. Not yet.\u201d He stepped into the office, hip bumped a plant, didn\u2019t notice. \u201cGoing to the museum tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountinghouse Museum? Lark\u2019s talk. \u2018Numerics in the Age of Primate Civility.\u2019 He\u2019s going to say something he shouldn\u2019t. He hinted. He can\u2019t stop hinting, that man. I figure someone has to clap loudly.\u201d Hart peered at the screen. He hummed a C. \u201cUncle\u2019s Tithe Fund. That\u2019s new.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen everything,\u201d Hart said, then spread his hands. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to see this. There\u2019s a rumor the monkeys want to make the uncle the new father.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nHart inclined his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense, Cole. You\u2019re right. This whole thing is cross-eyed. But\u2014\u201d He stopped, glanced out the glass wall toward the monkeys who had found their reflections and were making love to them. \u201cEverything makes sense to someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like that someone,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cI don\u2019t like that he\u2019s in my spreadsheet.\u201d\n\nHart laughed. \u201cLunch with Miriam?\u201d He had a way of asking questions he already knew the answers to that made you forgive him for asking.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d Ephraim said.\n\n\u201cGood. Eat good food. It might get scarce when the scooters run out of gas.\u201d Hart\u2019s face twitched. \u201cIf the monkeys start siphoning fuel, it\u2019s all over.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t need fuel,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cThey need an audience.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmen,\u201d Hart said. He clapped him on the shoulder and left a faint hair on his sleeve. Ephraim plucked it off as if it might deliver a surprise stinger.\n\nHe worked an hour. He took notes. He made a small chart with fewer colors\u2014a grayscale puddle that told the truth with a whisper. He printed it and slid it into a manila folder and wrote in block letters: TRUTH BUT QUIET. He shut his laptop. He touched his forehead to the cool glass and watched a juvenile monkey investigate a stapler like a bomb. The city had felt like this before, he thought, once long ago when he had been a boy and his mother had taught him to add his change at the grocery store. That was the day he\u2019d realized that sometimes the numbers came up wrong because someone had taken something. He had been seven; he had cried. His mother had looked around and said, \u201cShh. Not so loud. There are other kinds of wrong to worry about.\u201d\n\nAt twenty to twelve he walked to Caf\u00e9 Hav, where the tables on the sidewalk had been fitted with spring-loaded lids to discourage theft. The lids did nothing but make the compliments louder when they worked. Miriam was already there, hair tucked into a scarf, hands wrapped around a glass of water like it was a small animal she meant to teach a trick. He loved her forehead most: the wide plain of it, the place where she stored her thoughts. Her son\u2014his nephew\u2014Rory\u2014sat opposite, chin in hand, the other hand flicking through videos on his phone. He had dyed his hair a shade of blue that wasn\u2019t a color but a refusal. He looked up, saw Ephraim, and managed a smile that felt like an eclipse: a bright circle borrowed from the dark.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d Miriam said, and then kissed his cheek. \u201cI\u2019ve ordered olives. We have a window of time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore what?\u201d Ephraim asked.\n\n\u201cBefore they remember they like them,\u201d she said. She nodded toward a pair of monkeys crouching on the fire escape above, smoking cigarettes they had stolen from the bus depot. The cigarettes made them cough; the coughing made them laugh. Everything that hurt made them louder.\n\n\u201cHi, Uncle E,\u201d Rory said. \u201cI took a video of a gibbon putting Mayor Henley\u2019s hat in a urinal. It\u2019s art.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sound like them,\u201d Ephraim said, and immediately regretted it.\n\n\u201cNot like them,\u201d Rory said softly. He flicked through his phone. \u201cThey\u2019re dirty poets.\u201d He lifted the device so Ephraim could see: there was the mayor, face spanked with sweat, looking up as a long-limbed gray creature lowered the hat into a bowl that had not been cleaned since the last three parades.\n\n\u201cThey learned it from us,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cThey learn everything from us. That\u2019s the problem\u2014it\u2019s all a mirror. I just wish the mirror was clean.\u201d\n\nEphraim sat. The waiter brought olives, a plate of fried anchovies, and bread with a rind like a crusted planet. They ate first\u2014always eat first, Miriam had taught him\u2014because conversation could be stolen but food could only be taken from you one bite at a time, and that took time.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s school,\u201d he asked Rory, so he could pretend the world was normal. \u201cAny good teachers.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Lark is my favorite,\u201d Rory said.\n\n\u201cThe museum one?\u201d Ephraim asked.\n\n\u201cAdjunct,\u201d Rory said with the sadness of someone who had learned too soon how words could make a ladder and also a cage. \u201cHe\u2019s teaching a class on Counting Rituals. He says before we wrote numbers we had to eat a number.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat a number,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cI love that nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense,\u201d Rory said, and looked at Ephraim for allyhood. \u201cHe says you can\u2019t hold a thing you don\u2019t recognize. You have to put it in your mouth to know it. Infants. Tribes. Banks.\u201d He tore a piece of bread and ate it, eyes closed. \u201cHe says there was a ceremony, very old, where the man who kept the ledger, to inoculate the village against loss, had to\u2014\u201d He stopped, looked at his mother, and then said quickly, \u201cIt\u2019s a silly story.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell it,\u201d Miriam said, mouth full.\n\n\u201cHe had to eat his kin,\u201d Rory said.\n\nEphraim\u2019s fork paused midair. He set it down. \u201cWhich kin.\u201d\n\n\u201cNephew,\u201d Rory said. He didn\u2019t smile. He didn\u2019t look up. \u201cIt\u2019s stupid. It was a metaphor. Mr. Lark loves metaphors. He\u2019s like a metaphor with tenure.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdjuncts don\u2019t have tenure,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cAlso don\u2019t say nephew. It tastes strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt tasted strange in class too,\u201d Rory said, and then he looked at his uncle, really looked, as if looking was a new thing one might try between mouthfuls of fish. \u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cIt\u2019s a story. We have a stack of them. The monkeys like to climb them.\u201d\n\nRory laughed. Miriam rolled an olive across the table to him. He caught it with a hand he didn\u2019t know he trusted yet. Ephraim felt something cold drift through him like a cloud across a field, a shadow with a square edge. He drank water.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your job to fix the city,\u201d Miriam said later, when they were waiting for coffee. \u201cYou hear me? We all have two hands. If you spend both on the wheel, you don\u2019t have any left to drink your coffee.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know there\u2019s a tithe,\u201d he said, because the word had been rattling around his ribs since he\u2019d seen it. \u201cIn the records. An Uncle\u2019s Tithe.\u201d\n\nMiriam\u2019s eyes narrowed. She was good at narrowing. \u201cThat\u2019s a knot I don\u2019t want to pick. Let\u2019s eat our pastries.\u201d\n\nThey did. The coffee was a little bitter, in the way things are bitter when you want them to be sweet. A young macaque across the street tried to steal the salt shaker from the table of an elderly man; when the old man moved to block, the macaque bit his knuckle and then put its hand to its mouth and made exaggerated gagging faces as if he had fed it poison. Two other monkeys imitated the gag. They laughed. The old man stared at his hand like it had turned into a piece of the moon. He stowed it in his lap and would not take it out again.\n\nEphraim walked back to the office through a gaggle of them. One looked at his shoes and said, \u201cNice feet, uncle.\u201d Another threw him a puck of chewed gum, pink and wet. The world smelled like exhaust and old fruit. He missed the smell of snow, the way it had used to smell when he was young and the world had stopped for a minute and then started again with good intentions.\n\nWhen he sat again, he\u2019d been gone two hours. Two new messages: one from the mayor\u2019s assistant, explaining how color had feelings; one from the Countinghouse Museum, a bland invitation to Lark\u2019s talk with a line at the bottom that had been pasted in crooked: bring a friend or bring none. We are happy with your choice. The font was wrong. When he printed it, the letters flickered as if heat were rising off them.\n\nAt five he went. He told Darla he\u2019d bring her back a pin from the museum shop. She told him to bring her back a piece of good news, and then made the sign against the evil eye her grandmother had given her for free. The monkeys followed him for six blocks, hooting and making little kissing sounds, and then peeled off at the intersection where an ice cream truck had learned that playing calliope music would now be answered with rocks.\n\nCountinghouse stood with its back to the river, a square building with a frieze of coins around the top. The glass doors were scummed with monkey prints. Inside, the guards had been given whistles, and when a macaque tried to slide in on a local boy\u2019s heels, the guards blew so hard their cheeks fluttered like flags. The macaque laughed and mimed blowing into an invisible whistle until a third guard kissed him on the head, which somehow worked and the macaque left.\n\n\u201cMr. Cole,\u201d said a voice. Professor Lark materialized like a thesis from behind a column. Thin as a line, hair that had lost interest in obeying gravity, a tie printed with little numbers at play. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about the tram. It\u2019s a chorus these days.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had sardines for lunch,\u201d Ephraim said, a bit too quickly. \u201cWhat\u2019s a tithe.\u201d\n\nLark blinked. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say hello.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said it in my heart. What\u2019s a tithe.\u201d\n\nLark\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cA little bit of sacrifice formalized into the ledger so that you can look at it without bleeding.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you bleed and then you record it,\u201d Ephraim said.\n\n\u201cYou record it and therefore you can bleed,\u201d Lark said, not unkindly. \u201cCome inside. I will tell you something during the Q&A that will make three donors leave. I can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\nThey stood through Lark\u2019s talk with fifty other citizens\u2014fewer than before, Ephraim noted, although more than an English department reading. The monkey presence was there, too: small furry shapes on rafters, a hand dipping into a purse, a whispered slur like a draught in winter. Lark spoke about the earliest tallies, about knotted cords and burnt marks on bone. He showed an image of a ledger from a village nobody wanted to admit they came from, a book that had been kept under a floorboard in a hut that had been moved from the valley to a living room to a display.\n\n\u201cThe book doesn\u2019t say it,\u201d Lark said, and the lights deepened around his body. \u201cThe book doesn\u2019t write the part that makes you sick. The book keeps you from throwing up. It says grain. It says wheat. It says goats. It says winter. It says aunt. It says tree. It says nephew.\u201d He paused. He was dramatic. He didn\u2019t need props. \u201cBut the elders did not do what we do with the nephew. They didn\u2019t make him a scholarship. They didn\u2019t give him to marriage. They\u2014\u201d His mouth did a little grieving thing. He shook his head.\n\nSomeone in the back said, as a joke, \u201cThey ate him,\u201d and the room rippled. You could almost see the ripple, like heat.\n\nLark swallowed. \u201cIt was not a feast,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a counting. It was not cruelty, in the sense that a cat is cruel to a bird. It was algebra. A thing you hope not to have to do again.\u201d\n\nA monkey from the rafters blew him a kiss and then made a rude suggestion with its finger. Lark bowed toward it, still scholarly. \u201cThe world bears the marks of our arithmetic,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the sums go mad, the animals correct us.\u201d His eyes found Ephraim\u2019s like a pin into a butterfly. \u201cWe thought we could live without a ledger. But we cannot live without the person who holds the ledger.\u201d\n\nOn his way down the museum steps, someone pressed a paper into Ephraim\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t see the face. The paper crackled like something that had been dried on a radiator. He stuck it into his jacket pocket because his first instinct, after being handed something he didn\u2019t understand, was not to understand it yet. He walked along the river. He looked down into the water and thought of tongues. If you put a number into your mouth, would you learn it? If you put a world?\n\nWhen he got home\u2014climb the stairs, key stuck in a stubborn lock, the smell of baking sunk into the wood like forgiveness\u2014he took the paper out and unfolded it and saw seven lines of writing in a hand so careful it could have been a mask.\n\nEphraim Cole. You are the appointed. You will do the killing that saves. The monkeys will jeer. The people will weep. The balance will tilt back away from the bright snow. Eat the boy you love. Eat him before the Harvest Moon. Or all of us will be eaten by the final winter. Please do it clean.\n\nHe sat. He put the paper on the table and put a glass of water on top of it as if it might float away. He went to the sink and washed his hands. He washed them until the monkeys outside began to bang on the fire escape and chant, in a nursery rhythm that had kept him company for the last two months: \u201cUncle\u2019s belly, uncle\u2019s belly, yum yum yum.\u201d\n\nSomeone, he thought, was playing with him. He had always been easy to play with; he had had the wrong face for ignoring.\n\nHe tore the note in half and then into quarters and then into something like lint. He opened the window and saw the troop on the fire escape. They wore curtains like capes; one smoked a cigarette with the wrong end in its mouth and acted out choking for the others who applauded. \u201cBoo,\u201d said the smallest. \u201cBoo uncle.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo away,\u201d he said, so mild, so mild it made him angry. He shut the window.\n\nHe slept badly. Dreams like spreadsheets, cells\u2019 edges cutting into him. He woke at three and there it was again, the idea, the bright and awful clear idea like a sign on a bridge: this is where the road ends. It was stupid, it was offensive, it was impossible. It was also very simple. He hated simple. People used simple like a weapon.\n\nAt six, without coffee, he walked the three blocks to Miriam\u2019s. The street was nearly quiet; only a few monkeys out, the early ones, smoking and spitting, scratching their bellies, tossing glass bottles in soft underhand arcs at shop doors. Miriam\u2019s building was patched brick with a climbing vine that the monkeys had used to practice tying knots. He rang. He waited. He rang again. He could hear the radio inside, a voice that read the news with healthy confusion. He could feel the city stretching and then going stiff again in the cold.\n\n\u201cEph?\u201d Miriam\u2019s voice at the door crack, and then the chain; then her face, hair messy, robe tied in a knot like a coin. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI brought pastries. From the shop below my place.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a devil,\u201d she said. \u201cRory\u2019s asleep. He came home late from a screening. Something called A Poem Made of Garbage.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d he said, and he had, Rory had told him, and he hadn\u2019t understood. You could see a poem and not understand it. You could eat one and fail to taste it. He had done both.\n\nHe sat in their kitchen, which had a table he had swaggered into their life with, a table he had rescued from the curb when a contractor had gone bankrupt and had left furniture in the street like a trail of bones. He liked the table because it could hold weight without telling you about it. Miriam poured coffee. They ate the pastries. The ones with cream had been flattened by the bag; cream oozed slightly out and they used their finger to wipe it up. He thought about tongues again. He thought about numbers. He thought about the way his throat closed.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the sound of bad news,\u201d Miriam asked, and because they were siblings he said, \u201cShoes,\u201d and they both laughed. That was what their mother had said the year the factory shut down, when the neighbors filled their SUVs with things they had worked on for half their lives. \u201cBad news sounds like shoes.\u201d The clatter on the steps, the clatter backwards.\n\n\u201cI have a note,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t know he was going to say it until it stood in the air between them. \u201cIn my pocket. Someone left it at the museum.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I want to hear it,\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cBut also you do.\u201d He left the part out about how he had ripped it, and the part about how ripping had done nothing to it. He told her what it said. He told her the words like they had been written on a blackboard behind his eyes. He told her slowly, like the person you love is a fire that you can burn if you go too quickly.\n\nMiriam pressed her thumb hard into the table. He saw the whitish oval where the blood moved away. She was quiet a long time. The radio talked about the monkeys. The radio talked about a ward in the south where a troop had taken over the elementary school and had refused to let the children leave until they had taught the monkeys how to spell filth. The radio used the word unfortunate. The radio said, \u201cAuthorities are urging calm,\u201d and then a loud crash, as someone threw something at the radio.\n\n\u201cI hate this story,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cIf you told me a different one, I would follow you into it. I would. I would wear whatever costume you told me to. But I can\u2019t. I won\u2019t. Two hundred years ago people did a lot of dirty things and they called it math. The world doesn\u2019t ask you to be a knife.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like the world does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has the tone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we, then,\u201d she asked, \u201cif not the ones who tilt back? If not the ones who refuse to look at a boy and see an answer.\u201d\n\nHe rubbed his face. He wanted to leave so he could stop hurting her with himself. He wanted to stay so whatever came would come while he was there to stand in front of it with his hair and his body and his poor math.\n\nFrom Rory\u2019s room came a crash. Then a curse. Then silence. Ephraim stood before Miriam could. He had a key to the hallway lock; he didn\u2019t knock. He walked in like family walks in: with his hand up as if a room can be covered like a bird.\n\nRory sat cross-legged on the floor, surrounded by the spilled guts of his backpack: a camera, two notebooks, a banana with a bite out of it and then another bite out of the peel. He looked up, startled, then laughed, then saw his mother behind Ephraim and reconfigured his face. Ephraim wanted to call the face \u201chonest,\u201d but it was more complicated than that. It was what you put on when you knew the world wanted to suck on your skin.\n\n\u201cWhat broke,\u201d Miriam asked. Her voice had gone into the tone she saved for nurses and that one uncle who drank the Christmas cards.\n\n\u201cThe little tripod,\u201d Rory said. \u201cIt was cheap. I bought it with my own money. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll use books instead.\u201d He stacked some books. They were about film and about old cities and about how to make a home out of a place that bites.\n\nEphraim kneeled and set the tripod up and clicked it. It clicked. \u201cA screw,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a break.\u201d He turned the screw with his thumbnail until it obeyed. He wanted to fix everything with thumbnails and not with old words. He wanted to be allowed to do that.\n\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Rory said. He looked at him as if the thanks were a way to put a coin in a machine. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong,\u201d he asked, surprising both of them. \u201cYou look like math.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am math,\u201d Ephraim said, because it was easier than saying the other thing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go. I\u2019ll send you that grant link, okay?\u201d\n\nRory\u2019s eyebrows lifted. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI will apply. But don\u2019t give me a ladder that goes into the wrong house.\u201d\n\nOn the way out, Miriam put her hand on Ephraim\u2019s wrist. \u201cWe make our own sums,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do. No one gets to tell us who is food.\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree,\u201d he said. The words floated like balloons; he tied them to his chair in his mind. \u201cI agree.\u201d\n\nHe went to work. He stared at his screen until seven. He solved for x and then for y. He solved for z and then he solved for a little boy with blue hair and a camera and a mother who was not wrong. He did not find a solution that did not put blood in the margins. The monkeys on the other side of the glass had taken to hitting their heads on the window in a steady rhythm. Someone had given them helmets. He did not decide anything because deciding would change the world and he was not ready to end the world yet. The world liked to decide itself.\n\nOn the tram home, the bandaged capuchin winked at him and made a motion like cutting a steak. \u201cYou do it yet?\u201d it asked.\n\n\u201cDo what,\u201d Ephraim said. His mouth was dry. He didn\u2019t like its interest. He didn\u2019t like the way news traveled in fur.\n\n\u201cDinner,\u201d the monkey said. \u201cThe city is hungry. Your stomach is a balcony.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop talking,\u201d said the girl with the calculus book, and the monkey hopped away, offended but pleased with its own offended. The tram sang that song metal sings when it\u2019s tired. The driver didn\u2019t stop at the hospital even when a woman in the aisle clutched her belly and made a sound like a zipper breaking. They said the hospitals were full of monkeys. They said monkeys cradled babies and did not drop them. They said many things. Ephraim had learned, in the last six months, to write the words they say in his notebook and put a box beside them and leave it unchecked.\n\nHe got home at nine. The bakery downstairs had closed. The scent of sugar lingered like a rumor. He leaned against the door and thought about the moment before a storm when the air feels like a wet map, the moment where all the roads lead into the center and also away. He closed his eyes. He saw the word nephew. He saw it without letters. He saw it as a shape: a small shape with too much gravity, a shape that makes everything bend.\n\nHe opened his eyes. There was a second note under the door. He did not move. He watched it as if you could make a letter go away by not touching it. His heart did something he didn\u2019t approve of. He bent finally, because that is what men who hold ledgers do, they bend and they lift and they add. He opened the note. He did not breathe while he opened it, as if oxygen were a vote.\n\nIt said: Do not share this with anyone. Do not. There is a timeline and we are already late. The monkeys are rehearsal. The bright snow is real. We will all die in it. Eat him, Ephraim. You said you would once. Once you said, If the world asked me, I would. The world is asking. It has written it on its cheek in lipstick. Do the small cruelty to prevent the large. Do the close harm to save the far.\n\nNo signature. A smear of something at the bottom that looked like ash but smelled like sugar.\n\nHe went to the window. Outside, a troop had stolen a car and were taking turns honking the horn while one sat on the roof and made a speech about freedom that was only curse words and two big ideas. A policeman stood on the corner and watched and smoked and didn\u2019t call it in. A stranger walked past with a guitar case and did not open it. The world had learned how to keep its secrets in plain sight.\n\nHe slept on the couch because the bed was haunted by decision. He woke at two to a sound that sounded like monkeys singing a lullaby and a man screaming his own name. He thought about the bright snow\u2014ash, he supposed, an event where burning went wrong\u2014and he looked at the ceiling and tried to make himself into the kind of person who could lift a fork with the wrong thing on it. He failed. He fell asleep imagining he had hung his conscience out the window like laundry, and the monkeys had stolen it, and were throwing it like a frisbee from one building to the other, and he was laughing in a way he never laughed.\n\nDays snowed into one another like paperwork left outside. Lark sent him an email with a link to an article about ancient accountants with knives. Darla told him that a monkey had broken into the copy room and eaten a ream of paper with a relish that had made the interns almost love it. Hart canceled a meeting and rescheduled it and canceled it again. The mayor was on television saying that a little anarchy was just the price of life. Miriam texted him a picture of Rory asleep, face half turned, the blue hair like a lake in winter. He stared at the picture for a long time. He hit the heart. He put the phone on the table and did not pick it up again for a while.\n\nThen the first fire came. It was small and stupid. A macaque playing with a bottle of rubbing alcohol in a barber shop. A match, a flare, a whoop. The hair-curled smoke. The barbers went outside. The monkeys clapped. Someone threw a bucket of water that was not enough. The newspaper ran a picture that was almost beautiful, and in the corner of the picture, a man who looked like Ephraim watched a ceiling tile fall, and you could see his hand had lifted slightly, as if a reflex might catch a burning square of artificial sky, as if catching were a promise. The caption read: Barber Fire One of Many Small Incidents. The paper liked to end sentences with a verb. It told you nothing was finished.\n\nAt Kettle & Hart, Ephraim\u2019s spreadsheet grew a new column: costs of burns, costs of smoke, costs of night. He colored it black. He sent it to the mayor. The mayor\u2019s assistant wrote back a string of emojis the meaning of which was: send fewer graphs and also die.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, Lark came into his office without knocking and shut the door and cried. He cried with his whole body, like he had been holding something an hour too long. Ephraim stood up and did the thing most people would do, which is put a hand tentatively on someone else\u2019s back and then leave their hand there, a hand as placeholder for all the things you cannot do.\n\n\u201cThey told me,\u201d Lark said into the crook of his elbow. \u201cThere is an item. A budget. There\u2019s a date. It\u2019s printed. Someone printed it. If you print it, it becomes real. You know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the item,\u201d Ephraim asked, though he knew the tune.\n\n\u201cUncle\u2019s Tithe,\u201d Lark said. \u201cIt\u2019s not metaphor anymore. It\u2019s an appointment.\u201d He laughed, a broken cup sound. \u201cThey wrote in the cost: none.\u201d He looked up. His face was wet without shame. \u201cAre we the kind of people who let an appointment keep itself?\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cApparently we are walking toward it like a dentist appointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou could refuse,\u201d Lark said. \u201cYou could. You could go on television. You could be arrested. It\u2019s a kind of math. You could put yourself in prison instead. If they take you, they can\u2019t make you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat feels like a small math,\u201d Ephraim said, though he didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t know anything larger. \u201cIt feels like a math where you save your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is already gone,\u201d Lark said. \u201cThe monkeys say it wrong on purpose. People clap.\u201d He swiped his face dry. He pressed his hands to the top of Ephraim\u2019s desk. \u201cDon\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t be the ledger they want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be,\u201d Ephraim said, and saw that that sentence meant nothing.\n\nHe walked home in a wind that had learned new directions. The sky had a color like cold meat. He stopped beneath a traffic light where a macaque in a baseball cap was pretending to be a police officer and waving cars through red lights. A man in a van blew through and a taxi struck him and the monkeys laughed until one of them fell off the streetlight and sprained its wrist and then they laughed again. No one came. A woman on the corner shouted at nobody that she was leaving, that she would leave now, then stopped shouting and sat on a box like sitting was a death she could manage.\n\nAt his door there was a third note. He did not have to read it to hear it. He put it in the drawer with the other fragments. He made himself an omelet with too much salt. He could not bring himself to eat it. He ate a piece of toast instead. He threw the omelet away and felt like a criminal. If everything ends, he thought, it will end like this: the trash full of good eggs, the monkeys on the fire escape howling little hymns. He went to sleep in his bed because the couch had learned his fear and was feeding it back to him.\n\nHe dreamed that he was in a room with a long table and numbers in chairs. Each number had a napkin tucked into its collar. The number 7 turned to him and said, \u201cWe eat to live,\u201d and the number 1 lifted a knife, and a 0 rolled itself to the door like a tire trying to escape.\n\nIn the morning he had decided not to decide until he had to. He wrote himself a note: procrastination is sometimes compassion. He taped it above his kettle. He went to work. The monkeys had taken the copy machine apart. They handed out pieces to passersby: a spring for you, a little glass for you, a broken tray for the old woman with the hat that looked like a chicken. Darla made a sound under her breath and then smiled. \u201cWe have no copier,\u201d she said, as if confession were a new way to be clean.\n\nAt noon he went to the bathroom and splashed water on his face. He stared into the mirror. Behind him, a monkey was on the sink, pushing the soap dispenser like it was a casino lever. \u201cIt\u2019s coming,\u201d the monkey said cheerfully, in a voice it ought not to have had. \u201cIt\u2019s on the calendar.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d Ephraim said.\n\n\u201cBig dinner,\u201d the monkey said. \u201cDessert? No. Boo. Eat first. Don\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease stop,\u201d Ephraim said, and turned and elbowed the monkey gently, and the monkey licked his elbow and then jumped to the floor and went under the stall and disappeared like a rumor that chose another city to live in.\n\nHe had an appointment in the afternoon with a woman from the Department of Cultural Affairs who smelled like a candle. She told him the Civic Theater was going to mount a production of a play called The Last Uncle. \u201cIt\u2019s brave,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about complicity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat word,\u201d he said, \u201cthat word will be the end of me.\u201d\n\nShe laughed, and then she didn\u2019t. \u201cDo you have a nephew,\u201d she asked with an innocence he knew was not entirely feigned. He stared at her until her face did a human thing that made him want to forgive her. He nodded. He didn\u2019t say his name. Rory had not asked to be in a conversation with this woman.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do the theater,\u201d he said instead. \u201cDo a bake sale. Bake sales are better.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have to make art,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll lose your audience,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you\u2019ll deserve it.\u201d\n\nShe left, offended in a way that would become a story she told later at wine.\n\nAt sunset, he walked home by way of the river because the river did not notice monkeys. The river did not notice him. He stopped on the bridge. The bridge shook. A barrel went by, on fire, as if old movies had come to live in their city. He wanted to throw the barrel a graph.\n\nHe didn\u2019t call Miriam. He did not tell her he would not let anyone take Rory. He did not tell her he might have to.\n\nWhen he got home, the hallway was full of smoke. Not a lot. The little kind. The almost. He opened his door fast and went in and heard a popping sound from the kitchen like old film burning. He ran. The stove was off. The note drawer was open. On the counter, a monkey sat with its hand in the sugar jar, looking at him like a cousin. It patted its chest, as if to say, me. He picked up a broom and the monkey leapt to the ceiling lamp and swung, and the lamp went into the ceiling with a sound like a bell. The monkey dropped to the floor and ran down the hall and out the door, which someone had left open on purpose, he thought, but he didn\u2019t know who the someone was.\n\nHe shut the notes in the refrigerator. He laughed at himself, in the mad way you laugh when you\u2019ve done something the opposite of clever. He told himself: this is the first chapter of a book you do not want to read, and he was not wrong, though he was not right, either. He washed his hands. He drank water. He dialed Miriam\u2019s number. He did not hit call.\n\nHe opened his ledger, the paper one he kept for himself, because his mother had raised him to keep one even when the computer was a sweet singer. He wrote:\n\nUncle\u2019s Tithe: not acceptable, not edible.\n\nRory: boy, camera, blue hair, loves olives, hates ladder into wrong house.\n\nMiriam: forehead, coffee, rightness like a stone you could sit on.\n\nCity: on fire but only a little. On fire enough.\n\nMonkeys: rude; reckless; chorus; mirror.\n\nBright Snow: future. Ash. Winter. It rhymes and he wants to refuse the rhyme.\n\nHe shut the book. He put the book under the table. He sat on the floor as if floors were seats. The world outside scraped its nails against the brick. You could hear sirens sometimes, the real ones. You could hear calliope music. You could hear a profound quiet when a troop crossed the street like an army of toddlers. He put his head on his knees. He did not cry. He weighed crying like a purchase and decided to save his money.\n\nThe Harvest Moon was a month away. None of the calendars said it. All of the calendars knew it. The monkeys, who had learned the shape of time the way a child learns to whistle, were already humming the new song, their voices a net thrown over the city, the holes very small.",

                              "content": "By the next morning the city had found a new way to pretend it was ordinary, which is to say the baker had opened on time and a monkey had already stolen a bag of flour and upended it in the gutter so the sidewalk wore a white rash. Ephraim stepped around the powdered patch and thought, because he could not help it, of the phrase bright snow and the way it lived under everything now, a refrigerator hum in his head. He took the stairs to save his arms from the elastic humiliation of the tram straps. On the landing between the third and fourth floors someone had taped a flyer over an old exterminator advertisement: SENSEFUL STREETS ROUNDTABLE\u2014PUBLIC PARTICIPATION WELCOME. Below in marker, a hand that could have been a boy\u2019s or a monkey\u2019s had added: UNCLE BRINGS SNACKS. The marker had bled through the paper and stained the plaster wall in a shape like a mouth opening.\n\nAt Kettle & Hart, the usual ten-floor howl had tuned itself to morning radio; the monkeys had learned to imitate an ad for life insurance and were practicing it with great seriousness from the fluorescent light tracks, the phrase \u201cyour loved ones\u201d coming out like a growl with an opinion. Darla handed him a sealed envelope with a municipal seal and a cartoon banana pressed into the wax as if it were a crest. Her blouse had turned the color of lawful envy. She kept her face still the way brave people do when they don\u2019t want to make you into a project. \u201cThis came by messenger with a vestibule escort,\u201d she said. \u201cThey made me sign three times with three different pens. I used all of them wrong.\u201d\n\nHe slit the wax with the edge of his thumbnail, which had been made for lesser tasks, and unfolded a summons printed on thick paper that wanted to be a birth certificate. It invited\u2014required\u2014requested his attendance at a midnight session of the Consultative Panel on Equilibrium, to be held in a municipal chamber he had never set foot in, labeled in a font too whimsical to be legal: The Hall of Balances. The letter stressed confidentiality, dignity, and the spiritual seriousness of civic arithmetic. The time\u2014midnight\u2014crackled with ritual like a bonfire concealed under a tarp. The bottom carried the mayor\u2019s rubber signature and the City\u2019s motto, which had always embarrassed him: We Add, We Endure, We Eat What We Must.\n\nHart appeared at his door before he had a chance to fold the paper into a smaller truth. His tie looked like it had given up and was resting between the knots. He glanced at the summons and whistled quietly, a sound that used to call dogs and now called monkeys, although none came. \u201cThey\u2019ve decided to get holy,\u201d Hart said, and let himself in as if the office were a conversation. \u201cDid you bring olives for lunch? Bring olives. You\u2019ll need the salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want me at midnight,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cThey want me where there are no hours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want you where clocks dress in robes,\u201d Hart said, with the kind of gallows brightness that gets men invited to panels. He leaned against the bookcase and bumped it with the soft inexorability of a ship into a dock. \u201cDon\u2019t be alone in there. If they say you\u2019re symbolic, say you\u2019re heavy. Symbolic is cheap. Heavy breaks tables.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a theater,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cA theater where they\u2019ll hand me a knife made of vowels.\u201d\n\nHart looked past him into the pane of glass where a juvenile macaque was attempting to see how many paperclips it could put into its nose. \u201cThe theater is the economy right now,\u201d he said, and his voice dropped a half inch. \u201cThere\u2019s rumor that the tithe isn\u2019t a tithe unless the market sees it, that the number doesn\u2019t count unless the head nods and the cameras cut to tears. The monkeys know it\u2019s a show and the money knows it\u2019s a show and the City believes it\u2019s a sacrament. We have more audiences than actors.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you made a deal?\u201d Ephraim asked, because he had to ask, because the thought had been scratching his ribs.\n\nHart\u2019s smile moved left, then right, then left again, as if it had a turn signal. \u201cI signed a letter that said I\u2019d show up for the talk and bring a colander of jokes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I said I would not, under any circumstances, put my hands on a boy. I said that on paper. Sometimes paper is a way of making your hands known to yourself.\u201d He touched the edge of Ephraim\u2019s desk with two fingers, as if it might ask for a blessing. \u201cDon\u2019t go alone. Take a witness. Or take a camera. Or take both and tell one to be quiet.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon had the shape of an overnumerous book. When he could not stare any longer at a cell that equaled itself with a smugness he could not stand, he opened the City\u2019s parcel map and typed in 999 Cherry Road. The map blinked. The road extruded, then retracted. A light gray outline swam into being where a block should be, then faded, as if the block were waiting backstage and the stage manager had not called its name. He found an archival layer from twenty years back and there it was, Cherry Road, a neat line, a small orchard marked with a green fill, a cannery that had been given a little factory icon like the ones in children\u2019s books. The cannery had been decommissioned and then recommissioned as lofts and then condemned and then, apparently, subtracted. A red notice marker toggled on and off like a heartbeat.\n\nHe called a number he was not supposed to have. On the seventh ring a woman answered with her voice wrapped in a scarf. \u201cGeographic Information Services,\u201d she said, and then, as if only one person could have this number, \u201cOh. The accountant.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pen-chewer,\u201d he said, and regretted it. \u201cI\u2019m looking at a parcel that keeps changing its mind. 999 Cherry Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe call that the vanishing tooth,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cIt\u2019s an error we don\u2019t fix because every time we fix it a monkey shows up in the server room and pulls a cable with the exact tenderness of a midwife. There\u2019s an overlay, Mr. Cole. There\u2019s always an overlay. I can send you a screenshot if you promise to look at it and then delete it from your mind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d he said. He gave her his private email and received an image that made his heartbeat go tight. The parcel was annotated: BRIGHT BRIDGES TEMPORARY. Under that: CASH PICKUP\u2014UNDER RIVER VIADUCT K. Under that: COMMUNITY APPEASEMENT\u2014FUN. The F\u2019s legba had been rubbed out, leaving UN.\n\nIn the late light he found Lark on the museum steps with a satchel and a grin that had gotten into a fight with reality and lost, but only on points. The professor produced from the bag a thin bone-brown stick carved with a tidy ladder of lines, notches worn down by fingers that had belonged to men who had not known that monkeys could be a committee. \u201cIn case they ask for proof,\u201d Lark said, and passed the tally to Ephraim the way one passes a warm difficult object to a friend. \u201cWe used to reckon with things we could hold. People trusted us because their hands could touch the count.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a place,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cA parcel that pretends to evaporate. 999 Cherry Road.\u201d\n\nLark made a small face that combined delight and dread into a sauce. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, and yes. My student Sheila filmed monkeys there last month wearing hard hats and handing out candy that was also a card with a QR code that led to a clip of the mayor saying the word accommodate. Then the place was gone and the clip had a cat in it that nobody owned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see the place when it\u2019s pretending to be a place,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cI want to know if rituals come with lighting technicians.\u201d\n\nRory appeared from behind the bronze statue of a coin, hands deep in jacket pockets, hair still blue but with dark at the roots like an old lake meeting a newer one. He stood with the showman's patience of a teenager trying not to make it apparent that he had been waiting for the adults to get to the part with the verbs. \u201cIf you\u2019re going,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m filming. I already filmed the barber fire and a monkey throwing up into a boot, and I should probably also film the part of the movie where the uncle becomes a diagram.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe talked about ribs,\u201d Miriam said from the step above, and for a second Ephraim\u2019s brain put her there in the picture with Rory where she always went when he imagined them without himself. She had on her coat with the elbow mended and a scarf with cherries on it, because the universe could still be literal when it wanted to hurt you. \u201cWe talked, and you will text me the address of every place you plan to set foot in, and you will use your camera as a shield, not as a sword, and if anything stinks like a plan to make you into a poem, you will leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Ephraim said. It came out like gratitude wrapped in accusation.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she said. \u201cI brought you an apple because you are not going to eat dinner if you\u2019re practicing being a moat.\u201d She touched his cheek with the back of her fingers the way their mother had touched them when she wanted to count what was still warm.\n\nThey walked as a clump under a sky that had put on metal and gone out for the evening. The blocks near the vanished parcel had become a different city than the one on the map: signs replaced by drawings with bulging eyes and tongues; a dry cleaner turned into a studio where a monkey\u2014dressed in plastic pearls and a felt hat\u2014was painting a wall with big black words that said NO, THEN YES, THEN NO again as if the city had to be told every minute which way to tilt. A group of rhesus youths had made themselves a court and were arguing over a stolen sandwich with gestures that mimed gavels and crossed arms that meant the law. A woman with a bundle of something too soft to be laundry stopped and watched, then took out her phone, then put it away with a care that showed she had remembered the cost of losing the smallest thing you have left.\n\nCherry Road turned and stopped. Where the map insisted there should be an address, there was a drawing in chalk on a section of cinderblock: a doorway, very detailed, with hinges shaded into suggestion and a knob drawn as if it could be turned. A vervet reached for the chalk and added a tiny keyhole, then looked at them to see if they would applaud. Behind the chalk door the wall was blank except for a stain shaped like an island and a vertical seam where at some point the city had welded something shut. If you put your ear against it the concrete felt like a muted drum. Rory did. He pulled away with a grin that tried to straddle terror and joy. \u201cThere are trucks in there,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is refrigeration. There is a conversation that sounds like people who don\u2019t want their voices to know their faces.\u201d\n\nFrom the alley to the left of the chalk door a van slunk into the street with its headlights off and an orchard printed on its vinyl wrap, glossy cherries fit to burst. Bananas, lashed to the roof with rough rope, made a little yellow crown you would expect to see in a children\u2019s parade. Beside the driver sat a mandrill in a jacket that could have been satin or could have been a reflection of something else trying to be expensive. The mandrill\u2019s eyes, cataracted at the edges, had the bored disdain of a recurring donor. On the rear bumper a small sticker with the City seal had lost a letter so it read PUBL C. The van turned its wheel reluctantly, like a creature doing the thing it had always done while dreaming of a different command, and rolled toward the river.\n\nLark put his hand lightly on Ephraim\u2019s arm in the friend\u2019s version of a brake. \u201cFollow without being,\u201d he said, which was not a sentence that meant anything until it did. Rory fell back and flipped his camera on, the lens sucking light with a purr. They slipped alongside the block like conspirators pretending to be strollers. A troop had taken up a chant that was almost nice if you didn\u2019t translate it. A macaque with a newborn riding its back as if mother had been turned into public transport reached a hand toward Rory\u2019s hair and then withdrew it because the blue spooked it. Near the viaduct an old cannery had been facaded into modern with glass panels and then defaced back into honest with rocks. The van slid into the cannery\u2019s old loading dock like a memory into a void, the wide mouth swallowing and then pretending it had never eaten.\n\nInside, the air kept different accounts. Cold came from the walls. Warmth came from the exhalations of men in municipal polo shirts who were not smiling because their faces had learned that muscles could be watched. A stack of boxes wore the label BRIGHT BRIDGES in a font that said \u201cPlease, we are decent,\u201d and another stack wore no label at all but the cargo speaks: paper, much paper, reams and sheaves and rolls like a banquet for goats. On a whiteboard an internish human hand had diagrammed a calendar with hearts around the Harvest Moon and an event titled in large letters: UNCLE\u2019S PORTION\u2014BROADCAST WINDOW. Under it in a different hand: Call Insurance. Make Snow.\n\nThe mandrill in satin jacket accepted from an eager human a small black thing that might have been a phone or a remote or a trigger. She\u2014this was the same mandrill, Ephraim realized with the small nausea of recognition, the one who had licked the mike in the rotunda and had not afterward gotten sick\u2014touched the device, and a bank of lights flicked on, illuminating a stage that had been made out of pallets and city money. There were props: a ledger, a knife that gleamed with theatrical intent, a bowl, a cheap crown. One of the monkeys in a railworker\u2019s cap hopped onto the pallets and made a speech to the others that was ninety percent insult and ten percent instruction. The instruction was to howl at the moment when the crowd does not know if it ought to cheer.\n\nRory filmed without breathing. Lark mouthed something that could have been the Nicene Creed of accountants, which is to say he mouthed numbers in a sequence meant to bind a panic. Ephraim recognized his own name on a clipboard under a column that said: TALENT. Beside his name, someone had written in a cursive that wanted to be calligraphy, Clean if possible.\n\nA voice came from his left, too close to be safe and too gentle to be hated. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t see this until everyone does,\u201d the woman from Cultural Affairs said, and smiled the way you smile when you bump into a friend at a funeral and do not yet know if you\u2019re both supposed to be there. Her candle smell was faint; the cannery smell was stronger. Her hair was pinned with a green bobby pin that wished it were an emerald. \u201cI told you we\u2019re making a play. We\u2019re just doing it in a space with better acoustics than the city\u2019s failing theater. People listen to concrete.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re laundering policy through art,\u201d Lark said, a little too pleased to be able to accuse anyone of something that had such good rhythm. \u201cYou\u2019re feeding the appetite you pretend to satisfy.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t look at him. She kept her eyes on Ephraim as if his face were a ledger whose totals could not be fudged. \u201cWe\u2019ve modeled it,\u201d she said, and the word model floated between them like a paper ship almost on fire. \u201cThe thing that keeps the rail spurs open long enough to move the fuel and the sea-grain away from the plant in the south is a spectacle that takes the troops off the bridges and the alleys and leaves three hours of unmonkeyed road. The chemical engineers tell me the chillers go from safe to hymn in twenty-seven minutes if the power goes. If the ammonia goes, we get what your friend called bright snow. It\u2019s not a metaphor to them, Mr. Cole. To them it\u2019s a forecast.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen tell them,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cTell them the facts. Monkeys aren\u2019t allergic to facts. They just like them in costume.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe tried,\u201d she said. \u201cThey threw facts in the fountain because they floated. They like things that sink. They like a number that gets wet and falls apart. We tried to give them the math without blood. They ate the paper and asked for salt.\u201d She stepped away, then back, as if the air had a mind. \u201cIf you stand on that pallet and cut what we hand you, you buy us time to move tankers out of the county. If you refuse, you become a different kind of show, and we don\u2019t get the hour. I have to speak to you in cruel clarity because I am tired in a way that doesn\u2019t permit any more embroidery.\u201d\n\nHe heard his phone vibrate the way a heart sometimes remembers it has a job. His sister\u2019s name on the screen made his throat find its mystery. He silenced it, because he needed his hands to be empty to hear the woman say the part she should not say. She leaned in and said it, voice lowered to the register where things are called true because no one else can hear. \u201cThe first note was not wrong,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone likes you enough to put faith in your stomach.\u201d She looked at the stage and then at the vans with the cherries, which had their doors open like open mouths waiting for laughter. \u201cIf there were a way to do this with counterfeit, I would say counterfeit, and we would print a child of paper and feed it to the crowd. But then the crowd would leave with the taste of ink, and they would go to the hospital, and the power would go, and a different ink would print itself on the sky.\u201d\n\nA small shape at the edge of the dock turned and looked at them with the fascination of someone who goes to the movies for the popcorn. The vervet from the chalk door had found them, its hands chalked like a mason\u2019s, and it started to open its mouth and call down a rain of notice. Rory, quicker than a bond trader inventing derivatives, lifted his camera and pointed the lens at the monkey and whispered please. The monkey was vain enough to postpone betrayal to admire its own reflection in a glass it could not break. It grinned, then bit the edge of the lens in a gesture that had no meaning until it did. Its bite left a crescent and the monkey left a giggle and a piss-shiver and ran to tell the world anyway.\n\nThe first guard to turn tracked wrong and saw Lark first because Lark looked like guilt. His hand went to a baton and then to a radio and then to his face because a flock of pigeons rose from the rafters with the thunder of things that are both dumb and numerous, and they startled him into performing a dance that made his dignity buy a hat. The pigeons had been sleeping in the beams until the mandrill pressed the magic remote and filled the room with warm lumens. When confronted with light, pigeons believe they are applause. Lark, because he had been born for this sort of unlikely tutelage, lifted his whistle and blew three short and one long and set the flock\u2019s nouns flying toward the stage. Feathers hit satin with the soft decisiveness of receipts thrown into a fan. The mandrill swore in a language that had been learned from longshoremen and children. A human dropped a clipboard and the papers went far, because paper goes farther than anyone thinks, and one sheet with Ephraim\u2019s name on it sailed under a pallet and hid as if paper had learned loyalty.\n\nThey ran because bodies ask for mercy from thinking. Concrete under shoe, soft shadows that did not belong to humans, the fish-smell of a river that had believed its job was to carry. They would have been caught in a different city. This city, right now, was arguing with itself about whether you catch the people who came to see you when you were breaking the law dressed as mercy. At the dock\u2019s mouth a bandaged capuchin had mounted a forklift and was trying to reverse time with it, the machine\u2019s beep-beep-beep announcing the monkey\u2019s sense of crisis. When it saw Ephraim it scrubbed its face with its hand in an expression that had come from men who miss trains. \u201cPen-chewer,\u201d it said with a glee that made a joke on a ledge, then jerked its head in the direction of an exit disguised as a no-exit sign. \u201cUncle shortcut. Go, go. You owe me a bite.\u201d\n\nThey went, because otters know where the river deepens and sometimes monkeys know where walls forget themselves for a minute. A corridor smelling of hair and dust coughed them into the alley behind the cannery where a truck with bad brakes sighed at the curb. The Cultural Affairs woman had followed and reached the door as they disappeared; she did not shout wait. She put her palm flat to the cold metal and closed her eyes long enough to memorize a prayer, then turned and walked back into the building because her job had refused private vows for her.\n\nThey hid in the museum because everyone hides in a church when they\u2019ve been doing math with knives. Lark took them under the diorama of a medieval counting room where the mannequins wore faces that implied only medium concern. He opened a drawer with a key that had never been friendly and took out a ledger fragment that had been stolen, then returned, then catalogued as a lesson about wrong. On the page the word that meant uncle looked like the word that meant creditor if you bent your head. Lark tapped the ink with one finger as if tapping could undo sorrow. \u201cThere were substitutions,\u201d he said, and his voice did not shake as much as Ephraim expected. \u201cIn one village, the uncle was the vessel for the debt. They called the man uncle because to love him was to love the thing you owed. When the season failed, they killed the ledger. They drowned it, or they burned it, or they fed it to the oxen and then argued about whether eating by proxy solved anything. There is a fresco in Bologna where a line of men in shirts carry an account book to a river as if it is a boy made of paper. Someone could have said, This is childish. Someone might have said, Our enemies will laugh. But the winter after that there wasn\u2019t a famine. That\u2019s the kind of story people keep by mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can feed them numbers,\u201d Rory said, softly, as if softness could keep the walls from hearing. He held up his camera like an oath. \u201cWe can make them into food. We can print whatever this Uncle\u2019s Fund is\u2014whatever the pages say the city  owns of itself\u2014and we can burn that instead. We can bring it in boxes with cherries on them and let the monkeys tear the paper with their teeth and we can film the sound and it will be the sound. We make a banquet of the part that is eating us already and we let it be eaten.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t be allowed to print the city,\u201d Ephraim said. His own voice sounded unfamiliar in the room. It had become a voice that expected to be told it was quaint. \u201cI barely get to color the city. Darla will get a memo that says we\u2019re all allergic to toner.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t print the city,\u201d Lark said. He leaned forward, eyes brighter than the time when he\u2019d seen a potshard confirm a hunch. \u201cYou print scrip. You print bright, beautiful, edible money that stands in for the debt. Not counterfeit of currency\u2014counterfeit of an idea. We rename Uncle\u2019s Tithe to Uncle\u2019s Write-off. We stage a closing of accounts. We break the ladder that goes from loss to boy and lay down a different ladder, made of paper and salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt only works if they believe the paper tastes good,\u201d Rory said. He had turned his lens toward them and then away, filming the mannequins as if the frozen paperwork of five hundred years ago had something to say about never letting anybody get away with calling hunger a moral. \u201cIt only works if the men with the cherries and the insurance don\u2019t give another speech in a room with better lights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll try,\u201d Lark said. \u201cTheir mouths are rented. Their words are a fleet.\u201d\n\nA tapping sounded on the window behind the display. A monkey had retrieved a stapler from somewhere and was pretending to use it on its own tail. Another monkey, smaller, lifted a handful of something white and blew it against the glass. The something drifted down, ash from one of the small fires, catching on the window\u2019s pitting. Bright snow, thought Ephraim, and his stomach forgot it belonged to him for a second. He stood up and the body that had always liked to calculate did the thing bodies do when they have reached a ledge and see a rope hanging: it reached for the rope.\n\n\u201cI need Hart,\u201d he said. \u201cI need a press that can make a lot of sin in a very short time. I need Darla to pretend what I am doing is a milk run. I need the mayor\u2019s assistant to send me a list of everything we can legally paint yellow and have it not be a crime. I need Miriam not to forgive me immediately. I need her to watch it first and then decide if what I broke was smaller than what I kept.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can get you the press,\u201d Lark said, because if you stay in a museum long enough you learn that there is always an extra press leaning against a wall behind something else. \u201cA student can get you five. The interns want to be arrested by a narrative. They have been waiting to be told what their lesson is. We can print with soy ink. It tastes like beans. We can cut the scrip into mouth-size with those terrible paper cutters that whisper about fingers. We can stamp the backs with a seal you can smell. If you can\u2019t smell a seal, you won\u2019t believe you should eat it.\u201d\n\nRory texted someone with thumbs that had learned their alphabet while standing on buses. \u201cI know a print shop that owes me a favor because I filmed their flood,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have stacks they will call trash if anyone asks after them. They have a guillotine cutter with a handle you pull like a heart. They will help if we call it a pop-up.\u201d\n\nMiriam\u2019s reply to the text Ephraim sent\u2014Trust me\u2014came back like a stone that had been warmed by a sun she had carried in her pocket. It said: I will watch. Her second text: Do not practice any vows without me. Her third: Bring the olives. That was how forgiveness in their family worked sometimes; it arrived in a bowl and you put your fingers in and got them oiled.\n\nBack in his office, Hart listened to the plan and rolled it around his mouth as if he were testing whether the salt content would make him drink or sing. He pulled down a binder marked Retired Hardware and found in it, with the glee of a boy remembering that he had a slingshot in the attic, a permit number that belonged to a plant that had once exploded and then been rebuilt, then put out of memory and allowed to rest. \u201cWe can borrow their stamp,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ll think we\u2019re honoring their contribution to the civic fabric. They\u2019ll send snacks.\u201d\n\nDarla printed him three copies of a memo with the subject line: OLD PAPER DISPOSAL\u2014NO ACTION. She affixed to each a Post-it with a cartoon banana drawn in a competent hand. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get these from me,\u201d she said, and tucked her hair behind her ear and gave him the look people get when they are shipping you to war and want you to come back carrying a story and not a flag. \u201cIf a monkey asks, you\u2019re returning toner.\u201d\n\nThey moved the first pallets of scrip at night because night had been taught to behave, to stop asking questions you could not answer with a badge. The scrip looked obscene, the way too much bread looks obscene when you stack it on a table in a room with thin people. The sheets were vivid with symbols that borrowed the authority of the City while clearly being fake in a way that could be forgiven because the fake tasted like something. The seal said: SUBSTITUTE. The line under it said: THE CITY EATS ITS PAPER TO SAVE ITS PEOPLE. Under that, in small print that was more confession than law: This is a ritual. It may stain.\n\nWhen the monkeys came to sniff\u2014and of course they came, because monkeys adore the smell of any new permission\u2014they tasted and then made their faces, the good faces, the ones that say I didn\u2019t know I was hungry for this. They cackled and threw little handfuls in the air and the paper drifted like forgiving weather. A troupe chanted a nonsense hymn to food that wasn\u2019t food, and the rhyme scheme held. Rory filmed from a truck bed and caught the moment an old woman in a hat with fake cherries tore a scrip sheet into strips and fed one piece ceremoniously to the capuchin with the bandaged ear. The monkey chewed with the slow solemnity of a critic. It smacked and then said, in a human tone it had learned to use only when it really meant to be heard, \u201cSalt,\u201d and the crowd laughed and the laughter lifted.\n\nHe could feel, even before he saw it, the shape of the countershow being set on the pallets in the cannery, the stage\u2019s wood sweating under lights, the bowl waiting to be filled with the thing that would make the calendar keep going. He could feel the chemical plant beyond the south rail spurs straining, something inside it pressing its cheek to the glass of its own container. The phone lit with a message from the Cultural Affairs woman that did not art at all. It said: Two hours, if you can hold them. Then another: Please be vulgar. It pulls them harder.\n\nThey were vulgar. They were shameless. They were financial. At the Hall of Balances, which turned out to be in the basement of City Hall with a fresco of scales and a leak in the corner, the mayor and four men who had shaved twice that day waited with their lapel flags and their bottled water and their list of words not to say. At midnight, the time they had chosen because it sounded like guilt, the hall was empty except for the people whose schedules no longer belonged to them and one mandrill who had come to see if the City would embarrass itself properly. Ephraim brought scrip in. He put a stack on the table like a man bringing bread to a meeting that might kill him. He looked at the mayor and saw a man made of calculations, and it moved something in him like pity shaking a hinge, just a little.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t do the boy,\u201d he said, and the words, when said, made a shape in the room that had not been available to them before. He held up a page stamped SUBSTITUTE and saw how the mandrill\u2019s eyes blinked in a pattern that could have been grief. \u201cWe will do the ledger. We will do the paper you have been hiding under names made of cousins. We\u2019ll do it now. The city will watch, and then the city will eat.\u201d\n\nThe mayor rubbed his forehead like a man polishing a coin. He looked at the mandrill, as if the animal had become his conscience, and the mandrill bared its teeth the way laughter bares teeth. The Cultural Affairs woman nodded, very slightly. Hart stood at the back and looked like a ship\u2019s mast. Darla would never know she had been in the room, and she would keep that as a good thing tucked into her desk like a holy card.\n\nOutside, the first crowd was forming around the pop-up and the second crowd was forming around the rumor that something was about to make a different kind of sense. A few flakes of ash had begun again, slow and idiotic, not ominous yet, the way bad news sometimes enters from an angle. Monkeys lined the rooftops with the patience of men who have been promised a cannon. Somewhere, a horn played a note that was almost minor and then corrected itself. The city inhaled, the sound of a place that had learned that breath is a vote, and Ephraim lifted the first stack of substitute debt and held it for the hands that were waiting. He thought of Miriam\u2019s texts, a little drizzle of olive oil on everything, and of Rory\u2019s camera recording history\u2019s second take, and of Lark\u2019s bone stick, a ladder for tiny fingers, and he thought, with the clarity of a man who has tried to imagine himself a knife and has shied, that one of the uses of a city might be to write new numbers down and make them true.\n\nHe did not like that he had become the person who had to say the next sentence out loud. He did not like that the sentence he was about to say was both a con and a rescue. He shook his head once to make the bad part fall out and found that nothing fell. He put his hand on the pile of edible paper, looked at the mayor, and then looked at the mandrill, and then looked at the room, and then, because someone had to start, he said, \u201cEat.\u201d",

                              "content": "The city ate. It did not do it neatly, because nothing since the monkeys arrived had been neat, but it did it with the sincerity of hunger meeting a form it could recognize. In the Hall of Balances the first mouth to close on the scrip was the mandrill\u2019s, though later the mayor would say, hand on heart, that he had led. She took a sheet between her molars, bored eyes flicking from Ephraim to the knife on the ceremonial cloth and back again, and she chewed like a scholar who distrusts every source. When she swallowed, a murmur went around the room that had a shape like applause trying not to get arrested. The mayor tore a corner, grimaced as the soy salt hit his tongue, and performed the swallowing with a theatricality that made his tie look like a prop. Hart did it with a grin, Darla with the prim satisfaction of a woman who had learned to take communion and later learned to keep a ledger. The Cultural Affairs woman did not eat; she stood by the door like a match in a box and let her eyes do the chewing.\n\nOutside the Hall, in the open-lit rooms of the city where nothing was secret anymore unless it was printed in a font from the wrong century, the pop-ups bloomed. They called them, because people will always name a procession they don\u2019t fully understand, paper feasts, write-off tables, Uncle\u2019s buffet. The first one at the cannery dock had epaulets of monkeys along the roofline who made a music of their own with their teeth. The second, in front of the Countinghouse, was a solemn affair officiated by Lark in his numbered tie, who insisted on telling each volunteer, as if the city needed a liturgy, what a ledger was and why you could drown it and still keep your house. Rory climbed onto a truck bed and filmed until his battery sang low and then stole a charge from a sympathetic fruit stand that had decided oranges were a kind of ornament for civic rites. Miriam stood by the olive bowl to which she had held him earlier and passed out green eyes to those who wanted to wash the ink taste from their mouths. She had the face she wore when she might soon need to forgive.\n\nThe chant, once the monkeys decided it, hummed across blocks: Eat the paper, keep the breath. Eat the paper, keep the wheels. They liked any song that could be clapped, and the clapping carried the sheets into fingers that had always meant to hold a little more than they did. In the south, where the rail spurs quivered like the veins in a too-thin wrist, an engineer with a stutter counted backward in his head and watched the gauge climb and then wobble and then drop as the load pulled out. He did not believe in magic, but he believed in minutes, and the pop-up showed him its face in all the cars that were not in his way. The \u201cbright snow\u201d remained a phrase, which is to say it remained potential, which is to say he went home that night and put his children to bed and did not open the drawer with the pills that promise to smooth your breathing.\n\nThe cannery stage, robbed of its boy and its camera-ready throat, pivoted. The mandrill flicked the remote and the pallets rolled, the bowl was filled with shredded scrip instead of something that breathed, and an underpaid man whose job did not include the word faith lit a match to a line of fuel poured under the props to give the spectacle its necessary hiss. The monkeys jeered and then, because mockery tires like anything, they laughed and stuffed their mouths with the softened substitute. A faction on the rafters banged pipes in a rhythm that had been used to call men to work and later to call them to wake. A smaller faction hissed the word \u201ccowards\u201d in human language and jumped from beam to beam with a purpose that smelled like coming trouble. The Cultural Affairs woman stood near the soundboard in a dress that looked like it could be washed with a sponge and gave hand signals to a technician who translated theatre into weather.\n\nNews crawled across screens in that mutant idiom the city had taught its anchors: \u201cCity chooses carbs over carnage,\u201d said one. \u201cUncle\u2019s Appetite Satisfied by Scrip,\u201d said another, and then, in smaller font that bit the eye, \u201cChem Plant Avoids Worst-Case.\u201d An online magazine called it \u201critual arbitrage\u201d and posted a photo of a rhesus with soy-ink on its chin. Commenters did what they always did, composed small epics of rage and wit and injury, and out of the noise one coherent current announced itself like a river showing its channel: we will let a paper cut us if it keeps the knives off the table.\n\nKettle & Hart smelled like glue and victory on the morning after. The monkeys had found the shredder and fed it a scarf and called it opera. Darla changed her blouse for one the color of queenly patience and arranged a stack of memos in a line that looked like a road out of town. Hart took his shoes off in his office and put his feet on the radiator, which did not work, and declared himself a small nation with a hot climate. He was pleased in a tender way that made Ephraim want to forgive him for the jokes he would make later at bars that would pretend to be sober. He clapped once when Ephraim went by, not for the prank of it but as a private sacrament, and then he said, \u201cYou printed a thing and then you made it true. That\u2019s the deepest sin we have and also the only virtue left to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say that like you\u2019ve been practicing in front of a mirror,\u201d Ephraim said, and then smiled to take the edge off the truth.\n\n\u201cI have,\u201d Hart said. \u201cI write my lines on the bathroom tile with my finger and watch the steam erase them. It makes me feel like a gentleman.\u201d He lowered his feet. \u201cThere\u2019ll be blowback. There\u2019s always blowback when you satisfy an appetite that wanted a different menu. The mayor will attempt to name the ritual after a park. The Council will recommend that we establish a committee on edible paper standards. Cultural Affairs will hire a choreographer. A faction will call it cowardice. A different faction will call it cannibalism anyway, because they love a long word more than they love mercy.\u201d\n\nIn the late morning, an email with the subject line PUBLIC SIMIAN INTEGRATION FUND\u2014CLARIFICATIONS landed in Ephraim\u2019s inbox and split into five smaller emails as if it had been built by lizards. The first declared the success of last night\u2019s intervention and attached a PDF with photos of monkeys mid-chew that would surely be printed in a magazine where the layout designer had a grudge against captions. The second asserted that Uncle\u2019s Tithe had been sunsetted and replaced by Uncle\u2019s Write-off, a phrase that made his stomach do a small, intractable thing. The third admonished all parties to refrain from politicizing what was purely an economic ritual. The fourth announced the establishment of a permitting process for public consumption of scrip, complete with an application that required, in triplicate, proof of olive procurement. The fifth reminded him, personally, to keep to grayscale and to remember that color was for parks.\n\nLark arrived with a hand full of newspaper and the air of a man who has found himself on the right side of a legend and is grateful but bewildered. He laid the pages on Ephraim\u2019s desk and smoothed them with a palm as if all paper deserved gentled. \u201cThey\u2019re going to ask you to do it once a week,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to ask you to put it on the calendar like trash day, and they will do it with the equivocal blessing of the mandrill and the open question of the monkeys who wanted to see you bleed. They cannot help themselves. Systems want to be seasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not erecting a holiday,\u201d Ephraim said. \u201cI\u2019m not making a cake. We did it to get the trucks through.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrucks will need to get through every week,\u201d Lark said, and shrugged with the apology of a man who has broken hearts by describing a stone. \u201cOnce you feed a city a story, it stands on the corner at the same time the next day to see if the story will come back around.\u201d\n\nHe took the long way to lunch because he couldn\u2019t bear the strap-song of the tram with its music of monkeys and metal fatigue. Miriam was waiting on a bench with a bag of cherries that looked like proof a tree could still be a parent. She handed him the bag without ceremony and leaned her head on his shoulder for a number of seconds that had its own unit of measure. Rory sat on the ground, cross-legged, camera on his knee, editing with the kind of focused shamelessness that makes art indifferent to its audience. When he looked up, Ephraim saw that a sleep had moved across his face like a small tide and left a mark that made him look more mortal, which is to say more here.\n\n\u201cIt worked,\u201d Rory said without asking a question. \u201cI have footage of a macaque with paper in its teeth looking at the lens like the lens had committed a sin. I have a woman wearing a hat with cherries wiping her mouth after she ate the seal with SUBSTITUTE on it as if she had kissed someone she didn\u2019t want anyone to know about. I have the mandrill\u201d \u2014and here his voice got that thin shimmer of disbelief\u2014 \u201csmiling with ink on her gums. I could make thirty different films. I\u2019m going to make one and it\u2019s going to be about you and it\u2019s also not going to be about you at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a hero,\u201d Ephraim said, because you have to say it, and also because he meant it, and also because he knew it had no power to redirect anything.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rory said. \u201cHeroes are inconvenient to everyone. I\u2019d rather film a person who solved a gross problem with a grosser joke.\u201d\n\nMiriam chewed a cherry and spit the pit into her palm the way a lady might spit a bullet that someone had fired to make a point. \u201cWe\u2019re not done,\u201d she said, when she had her mouth back. \u201cI woke up at four because the radio told me to and I had a thought I hated and then I kept it because maybe hating is a way of knowing it\u2019s important. If the city wants to make this a ritual, we can keep showing up with our paper and our olives, but\u2014\u201d She paused, because words like but can carry a house on their back. \u201cThere\u2019s a cost to pretending to eat a boy. Even if the mouth knows it\u2019s paper, the mind learns a posture. Rory says film can teach us a posture and unteach it, but film is a slow teacher. Do we want that posture in the city\u2019s spine.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d Ephraim said, and his voice did a little thing it does when it runs into a wall where an answer hides. \u201cBut I do want the part where we don\u2019t freeze to death in snowfall made of wrong. I keep seeing it when I close my eyes. It looks like someone emptied flour in the street and then told you to breathe deep.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we do it once,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cWe do it twice if the trucks say please. We don\u2019t do it a third time unless the river changes its mind. We pretend to the city that we are creatures who can leave a habit before the habit has a chance to make a hoodie out of us.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to say yes to everything she said because she was his sister and because the little theater of his life had always played better with her in the front row, but the habit he had made of truth tapped at his ribs. \u201cThey\u2019ve already sent a memo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a form and a seal. They\u2019re going to ask for live music. They\u2019re going to ask for children to hold the banners because children make the news camera turn into a dog that lies down.\u201d\n\nMiriam\u2019s mouth tightened. \u201cThen I will hold the banner and bite the reporter,\u201d she said, and they both smiled, because if you can\u2019t laugh while you\u2019re deciding how not to feed your family to an idea, you will cry until your eyes forget how to do anything else.\n\nBy evening the improvisation had become a procession. Men who liked to coordinate told people where to stand and the people ignored them. A troop of spider monkeys discovered that if they held the paper under the tap in the park it turned into something like soup, and that if you drank that you got the sensation of having eaten a complicated thought, and the sensation was satisfying if you were made of nerves. A bar made cocktails with a garnish of substitute scrip and called them Uncle\u2019s Apology. A child no one knew put two pieces of scrip under a rock and declared he had planted a money tree and then wept when the monkeys dug it up and wore the pieces like eyebrows. The police put tape around nothing and then took the tape down and wore it as headbands. A butcher taped a sign to his window that read: We Sell Only Animals, Not Narratives, and a clever rhesus corrected it to Not Yet. In the south the tankers cleared the crossing and a man with a vest cried into his safety glasses where no one could see it and then went into the break room and ate a whole bag of potato chips without tasting a thing.\n\nAt the Cannery, where everything had started wanting to be real and had been redirected into real enough, the mandrill watched with half-closed eyes while a troupe of her cousins tore the substitute into necklaces. She had a way of scratching her shoulder that was primate and also very much like a woman in a nice chair remembering a song. When Ephraim came within earshot she made a sound that was not speech but was the sound old women in his family made when someone they had worried about walked in breathing. \u201cYou bought the hour,\u201d she said, in the language you use to hand a person a coin and ask them not to inspect its edges. \u201cThe others will say it was their whistle or their tantrum, but you bought it, and I will not forget that until forgetting becomes fashionable again.\u201d\n\nHe thought of asking her what she had wanted him to do with the knife, if he had chosen the other road, but the monkey in her brows made him stop. \u201cWill they accept this every time,\u201d he asked instead, and he knew he was being a bureaucrat even as he felt the shame of it. \u201cWill your theatre hold.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them want blood,\u201d she said, and the words came out so evenly it took his skin a beat to prickle. \u201cSome of them want wheat. Some of them want only to throw rocks and see what noise the glass makes. We will argue among ourselves in a way that looks like dancing to you. The little ones will love the taste and the noise. The old will get belly aches and call in sick to scratching. The males with opinions will stand up high and make announcement after announcement until their throats hurt. There will be a day when nothing works and your paper tastes like a lie and our children bite your fingers. But\u2014\u201d Her gaze flicked to the empty stage and then to the river, and for a moment she was only animal in a running world. \u201cNot tonight.\u201d\n\nWhen he reached his building the bakery had kept the light on over the glass case like a watchman who needed company. He bought a bag of yesterday\u2019s rolls because the women in his family had taught him about thrift and because carrying bread had started to feel like carrying a signature. The baker, who had always looked like a saint in a painting that someone had given up trying to sell, shook his head at the news and said, in the simple language he saved for meat and for grief, that the numbers would not help him if the flour trucks didn\u2019t stop being afraid. Ephraim promised him he would print something for the trucks to eat if they refused to move, and the baker laughed so carefully the air stayed where it was supposed to.\n\nBack upstairs, the notes in the refrigerator had fogged. He took them out and read them again, because his brain had a chewiness that demanded he test the flavor until it faded. The first note\u2019s command had dulled since he had put it under the cold; the second looked absurd, like a child\u2019s threat; the third, which he had not read in the anger of the smoke, was written in the same careful hand and said only: You are late. He held it under his nose and the sugar-smell rose again, interleaved with something like clean cardboard. He thought of the Cultural Affairs woman and her candle. He thought of the bakery and its dusting sugar and the devastation of flour if it chose to float. He thought of the cannery and its cherries, the packhouse and its labels, the van with its orchard wrap. He thought about who in a city writes pretty and who writes cruel, and found that the list overlapped in a way that made his throat thick.\n\nSleep came as a collection of visits rather than a single stay. In one, his mother was adding and he was subtracting, and she smiled the way a woman smiles when the man in the suit tells her a number that will decide a week. In another, the monkeys had learned to staple clouds to the sky and were trying to keep the weather from leaving. In a third, he watched a ledger drown in a river and found that it floated, that the ink bled into the water and turned the current into a sentence that said, in a language he had taught his career not to understand, not every debt gets paid.\n\nHe woke with a conviction that frightened him, which is that life wanted to make the ritual weekly and that he would have to break it before it hardened into a law. He lay with it for a while, as you lie with a fever to see if it will pass, and then he sat up and wrote in his paper ledger the only sentence he could write about it: habit is hunger wearing a suit. He folded the ledger back into its old patience and went to the window. The morning was cloudy in every way that word could be meant. The monkeys had hung strings between the fire escapes and were trying the concept of laundry; two socks, a shirt, something that might once have been a bra but had given itself to a performance, a page of substitute scrip with a bite taken out of it clipped by two old teeth.\n\nThe day brought the first formal assertion by a group with a font: SENSEFUL STREETS issued a statement on paper the color of sidewalk that said, in words too symmetrical to be believed, that the city had traded integrity for chewing gum. A different group, whose press releases had until now been concerned chiefly with birds, applauded the ritual as a victory for symbolic diets. The mayor announced the creation of a task force wearily called The Ritual Advisory Council, and in the same breath denied that any ritual existed and insisted that if it did exist it had always been part of the civic charm. Darla brought him a donut that had been made by a monkey at the bus depot learning to fry and said she would fight anyone who tried to make her eat paper instead of pastry on Fridays.\n\nOn the second night, a counter-rite took place in the Ward with the broken clock, which was always late and therefore was often right. A troupe of capuchins with faces like badgers held up a drawing of a boy and stabbed it with plastic knives. The human crowd did not cheer. It did not hiss. It made a noise he had heard only twice before\u2014the night his mother\u2019s factory closed and the day he had to tell Miriam that their father had given away some money that had never been his to give. It was a noise of pure, unembellished sick. The capuchins dropped the knives the way a child drops a stick after a dog growls. Someone in the back started singing the paper chant and it spread like mold. The plastic knives ended the night in the fountain, fossilized under a layer of public water that had long since learned to accept.\n\nHe went to the plant in the south three days after the first rite because he had to see what it was he had bought with the city\u2019s mouth. The engineer with the stutter showed him gauges with needles that moved calmly now, fat and almost smug. The chillers hummed with a tone that suggested satisfaction without arrogance. A man on a lift waved. A woman with a clipboard made a checkmark that felt like the opposite of a death notice. In a side yard a piece of insulation white as flour shivered in a wind you would not know how to name if you had not earned it with a life. He stood there until his breath settled into the rhythm of machines that did not wish to explode, and then he turned to go and saw, over the fence, on a building that had been left to angels, a phrase in monkey paint that read REAL MEAT with the E crossed three times. He felt the old cold, because there is always a faction, and the faction had learned to write.\n\nBack at Kettle & Hart, the fourth note waited on his chair. It had been slipped under the cushion, as if a polite burglar had come for a nap. The hand was the same, the neatness of someone who pens their cruelty like a clerk. It said: Substitution buys time, not debt forgiveness. The math has a stomach. We will come back in a fortnight for the due. The smear at the bottom was not sugar. He touched it and smelled it and thought it was ink, cheap and wanting to flake. He went to the window and found, because the city was no longer generous with ignorance, that a rhesus was watching him with the curiosity of a child in a museum staring at a mummy. He held the note up to the glass. The rhesus put a hand to the glass, palm to palm with him for a second, and then licked the pane and ran.\n\nThe Cultural Affairs woman texted him just before dusk to ask him to coffee and then amended it to ask him, with the boldness of someone who has run out of substitute verbs, to absolution. He met her at a place that had once been a poetry venue and was now a room where the espresso machine tried to be louder than the city. She smelled less like candle and more like scorched milk. She had not slept, or she had slept and had dreamed of a city that ate the wrong thing.\n\n\u201cWe negotiated,\u201d she said without saying hello. \u201cWe will change the weekly to a floating rite. We will deny it ever happened while asking you to keep a press on standby. We will ask the rail men to sign a pledge to call before they need it. We will ask the plant to create redundancies named after saints. We will try to teach the monkeys a song about chlorination. We are making a cultural practice out of a rumor. I have always wanted to earn my pension with a mural, not with a clever mouth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wrote the notes,\u201d he asked, because if you\u2019re going to sit across from someone whose job is to turn blood into policy you may as well ask them to tell you who in the city writes in the hand that makes you think of grade school.\n\nShe looked into her cup as if there were ethics at the bottom. \u201cThere are three people with that hand,\u201d she said. \u201cOne is a woman who used to teach Latin and now photographs weddings in rooms with exposed brick. One is a man who designs logistics for a grocery chain and is the only person I know who pronounces cumin like he\u2019s afraid of it. One is my deputy, who has a daughter named after a month. They all smell like sugar sometimes, because we all smell like sugar now. The bakery has been running its mixers through the night For Morale. I didn\u2019t write them. I have other sins I will cop to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho chose me,\u201d he asked. \u201cNot in a cosmic way. In a paperwork way. Who wrote my name under TALENT. Who twisted the knives into props and my body into a card in a Rolodex.\u201d\n\nShe lifted her shoulders and let them fall, a little. \u201cTen hands and none. The city knows your face now. Monkeys know it. People who hate the city know it. People who love it know it. When a ritual wants to be born, it shops for a midwife with a mouth that looks like it could say the word no and then fail to. You were available. You were brave in the way careful men are brave. You had a sister. Someone wrote your name because their hand had to write a name, and because yours sat up straight on the line. I am sorry for that, which is a small apology in a room full of small apologies.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t forgive her, and he did, because forgiveness now was a thing you kept in a jar and spread thin. The monkeys outside on the telephone wire imitated the coffee machine until the barista went out and clapped at them and they clapped back and everyone laughed and then looked down because laughing had started to feel like something you should ask permission to do.\n\nThey did the rite again a week later, because a transformer blew in the north and the rolling blackouts moved like a rumor through the grid and a truck stalled on a ramp and a man in a booth somewhere thought of his children in beds and called a number he had written on the back of a paycheck stub. They hid the second rite inside a street fair so the logistics could blend with the sausages, and that made it worse and better. Some people choked on both and blamed the other. A trombone played a song about famine. A woman danced a dance she had learned on an island where the droughts had faces. A monkey put two pieces of scrip over its eyes and declared itself a prophetic accountant and fell off a trash can with a dignity you could not teach. The three hours came, and the three hours went, and again the city did not snow the wrong snow.\n\nAfter, in the little midnight, a troop waited outside his door in a huddle that might have been ominous and might have been family. The bandaged capuchin from the tram sat on the stoop with a solemnity that made it look briefly human in a way that hurt. It patted the step next to it so hard the dust rose. He sat because the night suggested it. It reached into a pocket it should not have had and took out a folded thing that turned out to be a photo of a boy with blue hair and a camera. It held the photo up like a mirror and then like a map and then like a thing you give to a man when you want to see if he will look away. \u201cUncle,\u201d it said, and for the first time the voice was without its wire-scrape. \u201cIf something wants him, I bite. If something wants you, I film.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d he asked, because the question is the only bread most nights.\n\n\u201cBecause you fed me paper when I wanted a knife,\u201d the capuchin said, and then, in a hurry, as if the words might burn its mouth, \u201cBecause I like your sister\u2019s olives.\u201d It tucked the photo back into its imaginary pocket and hopped away as if the step had finished listening.\n\nHe slept in spurts and woke to a heartbeat that did not belong to him. It took him longer than it should have to realize the sound came from the opposite side of his door, where something with an insistence that had learned to stand knocked politely, once, and then waited as if it knew the house. He stood and felt his body do the math of fight or flight and choose neither, because the city had taught him a third answer. He opened the door. Miriam stood there with her scarf askew and a righteousness that had learned to say please. Behind her, Rory hung back with his camera turned off and his eyes on. Between them, on the landing, a man with a municipal badge and a face like wet cardboard clutched a clipboard in both hands and read from it as if reading would protect him from being charred by their attention. He said the words slowly so none of them would fail to enter the house: \u201cNotice of Intention to Formalize Civic Rite,\u201d and then he read the line that turned Ephraim\u2019s stomach into a salt pan: \u201cThe City requires the presence of the Appointed at Harvest Moon in the Hall of Balances to conduct the Write-off in full view, pursuant to Section 9 of the Emergency Equilibria, with components to be determined by the Council in consultation with Simian Representatives. Noncompliance triggers contingency Theta, colloquially known as the Bright Snow Clause.\u201d He looked up with the apology of a man whose job made him a mouth for a god he did not choose. \u201cSir,\u201d he said, \u201cthey told me to say the words as gently as I could, and they did not tell me what they mean by \u2018components.\u2019\u201d",

He had on the kind of raincoat that made weather look personal. His eyes were the small kind of tired, the kind that belongs to a person who has not yet earned a big tired. Miriam did not invite him in, which was a kindness disguised as rudeness; the landing was small but larger than any room that agreed to hold policy. Rory leaned sideways and read the word components with his camera hand, his other hand in his pocket the way some young men hide a prayer.\n\n\u201cWhat do they mean by components,\u201d Miriam asked, and the municipal man performed a mouth that was almost a shrug.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t say,\u201d he replied. He had a voice that belonged to filing cabinets. \u201cThe memo arrived with the seal, and the seal arrived with a note that said Don\u2019t elaborate. The phrase is in italics. Italics make people feel better about cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho sent you,\u201d Ephraim asked. He was polite in the old way because his body could not suddenly be rude; the habit had settled into his muscles the way certain songs stay in a church.\n\n\u201cConsultative Panel on Equilibrium,\u201d the man said, and the title tried to float away, ashamed of its own adjectives. \u201cThe chair is the mayor on paper and a woman from Cultural Affairs in practice. The simian contingent is represented by the mandrill, a juvenile rhesus for optics, and a chimpanzee who never speaks and therefore is taken very seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell them we received the notice,\u201d Miriam said. Her mouth did not curl. \u201cTell them we are considering our wardrobe.\u201d\n\nThe man nodded in the solemn rhythm of a park pigeon. \u201cI have to get five signatures that say I handed this over,\u201d he said, and produced a pen like a magician who hates applause. They signed where he pointed. He thanked them as if they had given him a glass of clean water, then went down the stairs by counting them, because counting is how some people keep from becoming.\n\nWhen the door shut, the landing exhaled like a stomach after dinner. Miriam turned to her brother with a face that had decided not to make a scene, which made the scene knock louder. She walked into the kitchen without invitation, which is how family says yes to the worst and the best, and filled three glasses with water from the tap as if the tap ought to be invoked before any oath. The kitchen had the modest dignity of a man who is precise about salt. The refrigerator compressor hummed like a minor choir. The notes in the drawer\u2014he had put them back in cold because superstition needs a shelf\u2014clicked like cards when he closed the door too hard.\n\n\u201cThey want to put on a longer play,\u201d Rory said, with the blunt clarity art sometimes borrows from weather. \u201cThey want spectacle enough to eat more time. They want to own the word Harvest the way festivals own months. Components means blood, or hair, or witness, or something that can be measured with regret. If they can\u2019t get blood they\u2019ll ask for tears and call it saline.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can have mine,\u201d Miriam said, and the words had iron filings in them. \u201cThey can have my hair, they can have my spit, they can have my right to look ridiculous in public. They cannot have my son\u2019s presence as a prop. If they want the sight of kin, they can look at a city street. Every face is cousin to every other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey may not need Rory\u2019s body,\u201d Ephraim said, and felt how stupid it sounded as it left. \u201cThey may only need his proximity. They only need him the way a star needs an edge to hang on. They can say the word nephew while the camera finds him. They can let me say his name while they let the city watch to see if my mouth trembles appropriately.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t say it,\u201d Miriam replied. She put the glass down harder than water requires. \u201cYou say ledger, you say paper, you say substitute, you say write-off until the word loses all flavor and then you say it again. You don\u2019t say the word they think buys them holiness. You don\u2019t give them an altar that looks like a family.\u201d\n\nHe wanted to promise and found his throat protective of nothing. He imagined the Hall of Balances at midnight with its fresco of scales already tilting their faces toward any noise. He imagined the mandrill\u2019s bored eyes and the juvenile rhesus sitting up straight to make his elders proud in front of cameras. He imagined the Cultural Affairs woman with her candle smell and her clipboard full of verbs already chosen. He imagined the empty clause that said components and left the city\u2019s mouth to fill it with what was handy. He set his glass down and coughed once because there are sounds a body makes when it agrees to carry something it doesn\u2019t know the weight of.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll negotiate,\u201d he said, and found he was speaking to his own hands. \u201cIf they want components, they\u2019ll get paper. They\u2019ll get ink. They\u2019ll get hair that is not human. They\u2019ll get tears that are not mine. They\u2019ll get a ledger that has learned to swim. We\u2019ll smother them in the correct thing until they forget the wrong thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go with you,\u201d Miriam said. She had her coat already, as if her body could rehearse the future and feel safer. \u201cIf they let us, we go into that room. If they don\u2019t let us, we stand in the hall with the women who know how to look like the past that won\u2019t move. I\u2019ll bring olives, and if they try to take the bowl, I\u2019ll bite.\u201d\n\nRory looked at him the way boys look at rivers they\u2019re about to film, with awe and with an assessment of whether the current wants to keep the camera. \u201cI\u2019ll make a piece before the Harvest,\u201d he said. \u201cNot a protest piece, not agitprop, because propaganda just teaches the mouth to say a new lie. A piece that teaches posture. Something that shows the city how to refuse to open its jaw for anything but paper. I\u2019ll cut it so that to watch it is to learn a muscle. I\u2019ll put it on every screen that wants to swallow it. I\u2019ll seed it in the monkeys\u2019 phones with a sound that makes them think it\u2019s one of theirs.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Ephraim said, and felt the mercy of command, which is that sometimes you get to tell someone to build the thing you need and to receive from their yes a future you didn\u2019t have to watch being born. \u201cMake it a tutorial. Make it an infection. Make it vulgar and soft. Make it eat everything except us.\u201d\n\nThe pre-meeting took place in a room with a carpet that had been installed to sound expensive and now only sounded tired. The Hall of Balances was one floor up, dreaming of midnight. Here, in a chamber meant for arbitration, the chairs had arms as if everyone who sat in them was expected to need help getting up. The mayor sat with both palms on the table, a man who had learned to pray to his own skin. The Cultural Affairs woman had a legal pad with sections blocked off by color and an expression like a good mother at a bad school play. Hart took a seat where he could see the door and the ceiling and the farthest corner, because some men keep their own fire codes. Lark arrived late and carried under his arm a rolled print of a ledger page that had once told a village when to stop borrowing against its children. The simian contingent entered as a band would: the mandrill wearing nothing that pretended clothes but everything that pretended audience, the juvenile rhesus with hair slicked in a gesture someone had taught him without thinking, the chimp with sorrow in the face like a permanent winter.\n\n\u201cWe thank you for the hour,\u201d the mayor said without preamble, which was, in itself, preamble. \u201cWe thank you for avoiding the Clause. We also have to name what a great many of my defenders are calling the danger of softness. The rite is now a thing, whatever the Rite Advisory Council wants to say. We have to specify what it contains so it becomes an instrument rather than a mood.\u201d\n\n\u201cComponents,\u201d the Cultural Affairs woman said, and looked, despite herself, at the mandrill. \u201cWe should formalize a list, specific and symbolic. The list would be published and then lied about and then re-published and stuck to anyway. The list would include paper, ink, salt, air, the presence of witnesses, the use of the seal, the placement of the bowl, the destruction of records that should be destroyed and the protection of those that shouldn\u2019t. It should not include any human parts.\u201d\n\n\u201cHair,\u201d the rhesus said, and the room turned to him as if the word were a bell. He touched his head where his mother or someone had smoothed his crown. \u201cYou shave your head,\u201d he added, and pointed at Ephraim with the grave cruelty of a boy imitating his elders. \u201cUncle\u2019s hair. It grows again. We get to laugh. We get to keep a thing that feels like a tooth without blood. The old ones care about hair.\u201d\n\nHart leaned in as if he wished he had a foil. \u201cHe keeps it short,\u201d he said mildly. \u201cMonkeys pull.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we cut his eyebrows,\u201d the rhesus said with a seriousness that made two aides from the budget office cough into their sleeves to hide the automatic laughter. The mandrill did not smile, and the rhesus blushed under his fur and dropped his eyes and then looked proud of his own humiliation, which is a trick with monkeys and with men.\n\n\u201cNo human is shaved,\u201d Miriam said from the back, because the door had not been guarded against sisters and she had her coat on like armor. \u201cNo human is plucked. You want hair, we bring you hair from the brush of a city\u2019s dogs. We bring you hair from sheep that never asked to be citizens but paid taxes in a way that tasted better. You want a token, we hang a wreath of hair at the door and call it an old custom. You don\u2019t take the face of a man and make it your proof of power.\u201d\n\nThe mandrill watched her the way cliffs watch the sea\u2014without moving and with complete attention. \u201cI will not chew his face,\u201d she said with a dryness that qualified as charity. \u201cI do not like the taste of spite. But I want a change that you cannot launder with paper.\u201d She tapped the table once with the nail of her index finger, a gesture so human it made the room\u2019s skin prickle. \u201cYou will drown a ledger and call it blood, and I will nod, and the little ones will dance, and the old ones will say the city is clever but is it honest. I want one honest thing. It does not have to be painful. It has to be irreversible.\u201d\n\n\u201cRecord erasure,\u201d Lark said quietly, as if saying a slur. He unrolled the print and weighed down its edges with four glass paperweights shaped like apples that someone had given the city when it still believed learning could stop grief. \u201cThere is a category in the oldest books called the Feast of Closure. It is what we did when we knew the line had become a snake. You write a name that should never have been on the page and you take a knife and cut the strip of parchment and you feed the strip to the goats and you let the goats move through the city and everyone who sees them laughs and says We have eaten the shame. We do not erase the wrong; we move it into a stomach and then we move it out of the city. We can do it. We have printers and we have goats. We have a river instead of a drought. We can drown the wrong line and let it go thinner than guilt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat line,\u201d the mayor asked, and he looked at Ephraim because a mayor is a man paid to demand specifics from metaphors.\n\n\u201cUncle\u2019s Tithe entries,\u201d Ephraim said. His mouth did the thing flesh does when it accepts that it must constitute speech. \u201cEvery instance. Every alias. Every hand that moved it from one column to another. We print those pages on heavy paper and we bring them to the Hall and we cut the lines and we lay the strips in the bowl and if a monkey wants to eat a name they can eat that name. Then we drown the rest in the river with witnesses. Then we stamp the ledger with the seal that says closed and we pay whoever expects money with the thing they deserve, which is apology and an invoice for integer theft.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrowning records is a tenderness,\u201d the Cultural Affairs woman said, and the sentence had both admiration and warning braided together. \u201cIt is also a crime. The State will call it tampering. A future grand jury will call it erasure. A historian will call it a theft of woods from a future fireplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cA crime measured against what,\u201d Miriam asked. She had found a chair that did not require anyone\u2019s permission and sat in it like a stone sits. \u201cAgainst the clause that says we make the city an icicle. Against the habit that wants to make my family into scenery. Against the men who wrote components and didn\u2019t say out loud what their teeth were doing. Proceed to call it a crime. I will testify. I will bring a basket of olives to the dock and pass them to the jurors while they decide if they would rather breathe or read.\u201d\n\nThe chimp made a sound that was not language but in that room felt like a word that had not yet been invented. The mandrill nodded, as if to an equal. \u201cGoats,\u201d she said. She made the g sound in her throat like a machine warming. \u201cBring the goats. Bring the hair. Bring the bowl and the paper and the numbers the goat will wear out of the city. We will teach the little ones the song for letting go of a delicious cruelty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have goats,\u201d the mayor said, which was the first time he had admitted in public that there was something he could not procure with a phone. He looked at Hart, who spread his hands as if to say his marketing list did not currently include caprines.\n\n\u201cI know a man who rents goats to clear lots,\u201d Rory said, in the voice of a child who has chosen to save the family by making a phone call the adults cannot quite imagine. \u201cHe filmed me once when I filmed the goats eating poison ivy, and he owes me a favor. He will need to be paid and he will need the city to pretend his goats are insured. I can get him to the Hall if we promise him the goats will be beloved for a night.\u201d\n\nThe Cultural Affairs woman wrote GOATS in a square that she had thought would say FLOW. She drew a little face on the g that looked like it wanted to bite a mayor. \u201cWe are making a secular liturgy by committee,\u201d she said, and sniffed, not because she was moved but because the dust in the room had courage. \u201cWe will need to control the river access. We will need to choreograph the drowning. We will need to talk with Public Works about how to remove soggy paper without choking the fish. We will need to convince the television trucks that this is grim and not cute. We will need to convince the hobby faction that this is not a parade.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s another thing,\u201d Hart said, and his voice had put down its lightness like a coat. \u201cIf you drown the wrongs and cut the lines and eat the names and shave no one, you still have men with an interest in the Clause. You have one or two who maybe liked the knife because it made the city behave. You have somebody who wrote those sugar letters. They will try to shift the ritual back toward pain because pain is a better anchor for a habit. They will engineer a failure. They will trip a switch. They will pay a boy to push a red button shaped like a toy. They will convince a monkey to light a flame under a thing that reads where it isn\u2019t supposed to. They will say the paper does not taste good anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey will try contingency Theta on a Tuesday,\u201d the Cultural Affairs woman said, and looked like a woman ordering a drink she knows will be flat. \u201cThey will say there was a leak. They will say the festival kept the trucks from the gate. They will translate physics into malice. We have two weeks, and then their patience will convert to geometry. We need redundancies they can\u2019t undo with a small wickedness.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe stage an extra rite,\u201d Lark said. He had unrolled another print without confessing he\u2019d brought it. \u201cNot a show. A village thing. Quiet. The old accountants called them attestations. You make a line of people and each holds the ledger and breathes on it. You count the breaths. You mark the breath with ash and oil so the air learns to stick. You take the total to the plant and you give it to the man with the stutter and you say, We breathed this many times for you, and he nods and he feels like a man whose house was circled by the town at night so the wolves would hear footsteps and leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreath as component,\u201d the mayor said, and for the first time that day looked like someone who might have been a person before the word mayor had nailed his head to the building. \u201cBreath as a number. We can issue a certificate of breath. We can accept or reject in triplicate. We can make a pile of inhalations a thing you can drive trucks on.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not issue,\u201d Miriam said. \u201cDo not monetize. Do not let it be a stamp you can buy. Let it be a line in the ledger no one is allowed to round. Let it be done in the alley, at the plant fences, in kitchens, at the Hall, in barber chairs, on buses that still stop, in the cannery dock on the three nights it isn\u2019t trying to be a cathedral. Let no one own it. Let everyone know it happened.\u201d\n\nThey argued another hour because argument is how you bind a plan to a city that resists being bound. In the end, they wrote down: paper, ink, bowl, goats, hair wreath, ledger drowning, breath, witnesses, olives. They wrote: no blood, no hair from any human face, no children near the knife even if it is a prop. They wrote: mandate laughter, forbid jeering at the wrong moments, allow singing in two keys, prohibit plastic knives. They wrote: contingency Epsilon\u2014open every bridge manually with men pulling chains if the power goes. They wrote: call the plant every twenty-seven minutes like a man calling a lover who lives alone.\n\nOn the way out, in the corridor where the walls carried the hung faces of former financial officers whose eyes had been made of that cheap varnish that makes sorrow waterproof, the mandrill stopped beside Ephraim and watched her reflection in the glass of a framed certificate that had lost its meaning when the city had given new jobs to different sins. \u201cYou will stand on the pallet again,\u201d she said. It was not a question and it did not taste like command. \u201cYou will let them watch you cut the line. They will mark the angle of your elbow and make it a fashion. They will want to kiss your hand and bite your wrist. You will learn to keep your hands in your pockets.\u201d She leaned closer and he smelled the old fruit on her breath, sweet and wrong. \u201cWhen they ask you to say the boy\u2019s name, you will say instead the word ledger until it becomes a person, and then you will say the word city until it becomes an animal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not brave,\u201d he said, which has the advantage of sounding like humility and the disadvantage of being true.\n\n\u201cYou are useful,\u201d she said. \u201cUsefulness is a courage cities understand. Also you made something I could eat when all the men wanted was a scream. I am not sure if that makes you priest or cook. Either way, you owe me a napkin.\u201d\n\nOn the steps outside, a troop had invented a new sport: eating substitute scrip while doing handstands. A rhesus fell and laughed because pain performed is a kind of currency. The capuchin with the bandaged ear presented itself with a solemnity that had been missing for months and handed him a folded piece of glossy paper with an image on it that had been cut from a magazine. It was an advertisement for a winter festival in a far city where the snow fell the old way. \u201cWe don\u2019t like bright snow,\u201d the capuchin said, as if confessing a shame. \u201cIt tastes like cleaning. It gets in the fur and makes the babies cough. We like dirty snow that tells you what everyone stepped in. If you do the thing with goats, I will throw rocks at anyone who tries to throw rocks at the goats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Ephraim said, and meant it in the way you mean it when a thing whose teeth scare you offers its teeth to your defense.\n\nThe week bent itself into preparations the way wire remembers a shape when you twist it. Rory filmed people breathing on paper for Lark\u2019s attestation archive, and he did it with such a tenderness the air around the subjects seemed to thicken. He cut a tutorial about refusal that moved like a disease and was greeted on phones by faces who had learned to open every link with suspicion. There was a shot of the bowl filling with names he had found in the sewer of the budget; there was a shot of a dog shedding while a hand collected the hair; there was a shot of a goat chewing an invoice with the concentration of a monk; there was a shot of Miriam on her stoop, solemn as a gate, speaking the line We eat the paper and keep the breath as if it were a recipe her mother had taught her at the sink. He watched it back and cut and cut until the film did the thing he had promised: it taught a city a muscle.\n\nHart secured the goats with a mixture of charm and a check that would bounce only if two more fires happened. Darla acquired the hair wreath with an efficiency that made everyone understand she had been waiting all her life to deliver a relic. She had a cousin in a grooming shop who thought the city was a halting romance with a dog and who took it as a point of pride to build a wreath big enough to shame a doorway. The Cultural Affairs woman wrangled the agency list until every page had a phone number in the upper right corner and a person next to it who would actually pick up. The mayor practiced not saying nephew in a mirror and practiced saying ledger with the gravity of a man saying his own name.\n\nThe sugar letters did not stop. One arrived tucked into a loaf at the bakery that had begun to bake at night with the doors open so smell could be a resource. It said, in that careful bookstore hand, You are staining the city with cowardice. It said, Eat the child and be done. It said, We have been told we only need once, and after once history grows a rind and cannot be cut. It smelled like cinnamon, which made the threat feel cozy in a way that would be funny if it were not a rehearsal of doom. Another was slid into the slit of his office door during the hour the monkeys turned the tenth floor into a squeal. It bore only a date and a drawing of a knife that had a shadow. He put both notes in the refrigerator because the cold had become the place where he put ideas that wanted to ripen into wrong.\n\nTwo days before the moon\u2019s appointment, there was a test of the breath ritual that went badly in the way practice must sometimes fail to save you later. In an alley behind the plant, a line of men and women and one child who had decided to be brave in her own way held the ledger and breathed and counted and marked a page with ash. A rhesus youth who had joined them the way birds join a flock when it moves toward something interesting took a marker and drew a mustache on the number 8. The child laughed, and the laugh echoed, and the echo sounded like jeering, and the men behind the fence looked up as if someone had thrown a stone. It took ten minutes to untangle the meanings, and when it was done a human woman and a monkey child cried for the same length of time without looking at each other, and someone said it was a rehearsal and someone else said it was a warning, and Lark wrote in a notebook with pleasure because his profession records pain with a gratitude that sometimes embarrasses him into softness.\n\nOn the eve, the city staged a different kind of riot: a rumor that the goats had escaped and were eating the flower beds in front of the municipal court. It was true in the way things are true when goats stand where men are used to standing and look more dignified than any argument. The court custodians came out and offered them salt on their palms like sacrifices to a myth that lacked a theologian. A troop of macaques in high-visibility vests set up sawhorses around the flower beds as if the goats were a crucial repair. People applauded. A man in a business suit tried to lecture a goat on the dangers of symbolism and the goat turned its head and sneezed spinach on his shoes. The mandrill watched from a step and looked pleased in a way that made It impossible to tell if she was approving of goats or of the ease with which animals made human fidelity look silly.\n\nThat night, a transformer somewhere that had been waiting to defend its honor finally chose to die. The neighborhoods flickered in a pattern that suggested a man\u2019s heart in an arrhythmia. In the short dark, a fight broke out under the viaduct where a man was sure his car had been blessed by an invisible authority to ignore certain lines. The monkeys yelled and then mediated and then yelled again. At the cannery, the pallets stood blank in the light of portable floodlamps, which looked like moons mounted on tripods and turned to face an audience that had not arrived. The Cultural Affairs woman walked the perimeter, counting under her breath as if a word repeated often enough can become an obstacle you can place in front of catastrophe.\n\nHe slept lightly, because the city had trained him to wake when verbs happen. When the hour came\u2014the mean hour, the one that had enjoyed a reputation in older stories\u2014he put on his jacket and his shirtsleeves did not quarrel with him, and he checked his pockets for the things you bring to a rite: a pen, a small folded photograph he did not let himself look at because he knew exactly what it contained, a list of names printed from the ledger like a tendon from a bone, and a coin from his mother\u2019s jar because she had always believed the world lets you pass if you carry something that understands the value of weight.\n\nOutside, the night had put on its formal shoes. The air carried a smell that could have been frost if the city weren\u2019t too warm at its core for that. Monkeys lined wires. People lined sidewalks. Goats rode in the back of a truck with a patient grace that made Ephraim want to be better at what he had chosen to be. Miriam walked beside him with a basket of olives as if she were a woman in a painting that has always existed. Rory walked backwards, filming and not tripping, and every now and then he blew gently on his lens, as if fog could be dissuaded with polite breath. Hart walked behind with Darla talking him into not kicking a traffic cone that had been placed to look like a hat.\n\nInside the Hall of Balances, they had made a spectacle out of sobriety. The bowl sat on the table like a mouth that had learned to close. The hair wreath hung on the door, ridiculous and perfect. The ledger rested on a stand that had been built by Public Works out of old stair treads so that it felt like a book that had done labor all its life. The mayor stood with his hand already on the pen as if he were ready to sign away the whole city if someone told him a good story. The mandrill perched on a chair and did not resemble a human and therefore looked more like one.\n\nThe juvenile rhesus announced himself by tripping and recovering in a way that made everyone who had ever had a body feel for him, and then he puffed his chest because it is the right of the young to believe in their faces. The chimp went to a window and stared at his own dark reflection and put a hand to the glass where his chest was as if swearing to a god who lives in panes. The Cultural Affairs woman did a headcount and used a pencil to write yes next to everything that would later be rewritten as no.\n\nEphraim stepped to the pallet they had brought in because the city now loved a stage. He set the ledger on its stand, and he felt the book\u2019s spine with his palm the way men touch animals to comfort them. The first page he opened to was an old one, a page that had survived damp and hands. It carried a number he knew by its posture. He cut the line with the municipal knife, which had the decency to be dull, and he laid the thin strip of white into the bowl, and it landed like a small fall forgiven. He did not say nephew. He said ledger once, then ledger again, then ledger until the word lost its meaning and became a sound like wood in a wind. The mandrill watched and did not blink until he had laid three strips and then she looked up and out the window as if to be sure no bright snow was falling from a sky that had never promised to behave.\n\nThey cut and they laid and they breathed. They took the breath into the book the way a poor man takes food into the house by standing outside and thinking hard about soup. They passed the ledger to the mayor and he breathed and failed to look ridiculous, which is the hardest thing a mayor does. They passed it to the rhesus and he breathed and made it a game and then took the game seriously, and when he handed it to the chimp the chimp held it with two hands and breathed a breath that shook the stand. Lark stood to the side and made the notes a scholar makes when he knows his book will be footnoted by the hungry.\n\nWhen the bowl was heavy enough that the table creaked, they lifted it together and carried it to the door. The hair wreath brushed Ephraim\u2019s shoulder and left against his jacket a softness that would stay past washing. Outside, the goats stamped, impatient in the dignity of animals you have asked to symbolize. The crowd parted. The monkeys in the trees quieted with the concentration of children learning a bad word they intend to deploy sparingly. They carried the bowl down the steps and out toward the river, and every few feet someone put their hand to the bowl\u2019s lip as if to steady it or to bless it. A rhesus leapt down and licked the rim, and a woman in a coat that had belonged to her mother slapped his hand away and then let him hold her shoulder for balance as he smiled at being told no.\n\nAt the river, in the place where the cannery had learned to resemble a Cathedral and then learned to suppose it might be a warehouse again, they set the bowl on the wall and lifted. The paper slid in a single gelatinous mass and hit the water with a sound like many small pages agreeing to let go. The current took it and did not choke. The goats, whose owner had insisted on being called by his first name as if goats were above titles, stepped forward with ceremony and chewed the strips that had stuck to the rim with a focus that made the whole act look like a psalm. People cried in the way of men who have decided crying is the tax for still being here.\n\nAfter the bowl, there were names to eat and names to drown and names to refuse. He looked once at the list and saw his own printed in a column that was not meant for eating, and for a second his body thought it would have to learn a new verb. He put his finger on his name and then put the page face down. When the bowl was empty and the water had carried its lint upriver to the place where sewage is turned into something less insulting, someone began to sing the paper chant. Someone else sang a different song, about something that happened in a valley far away. The songs braided and did not quarrel.\n\nIt was almost too smooth. He knew enough about the city to distrust clean. The smooth broke at the edge of the crowd where a boy with a face that would someday be a man\u2019s wore a hooded sweatshirt with the hood up in a way that made his mother invisible. He lifted a bottle from his sleeve with the shame of someone who had been asked to be a knife and wanted to prove he could cut in public. The capuchin with the bandage saw him first because the world owed him that moment. The monkey moved like the small version of mercy and put its hand on the boy\u2019s wrist with a gentleness that made the wrist remember it belonged to someone who had once held a spoon. The boy looked down and the capuchin looked up and they both looked sideways where a man with a municipal badge had stood on a landing and read a notice. The boy put the bottle back. The capuchin took the boy\u2019s hood and pulled it off, which is the monkey way of shaving a head. The crowd put out the breath it had been holding and then took another.\n\nWhen it was over, the Cultural Affairs woman adjusted the note she had written to herself about the timing of goats. The mayor went home and sat on the edge of his bed and looked at his feet until the alarm clock, which had been set because the city requires a man with a title to observe the morning, told him to stand. Lark went back to his office and laid his hands on the bone stick and felt for a splinter and found none. Hart went to a bar that had become a room where guilt performed itself on ice and told a joke that made three men swear they would stop hating him and then left without saying goodnight because some kinds of happiness must be managed alone. Rory went home with his mother and cut a version of the night that did not have Ephraim in it at all and sent it to a list of addresses with the subject line Watch This To Learn A Mouth. Miriam lay on her bed and cried without letting her throat make a sound because some sounds are owed to different days. The mandrill slept on a roof curled around a heat vent like a poor god and dreamed of a river that speaks.\n\nEphraim counted. He counted trucks. He counted the breaths that had been taken and were now scattered in lungs and along the river, in the goats\u2019 bellies, in the bowl with its rim salt-bitter on the tongue. He counted the futures he had bought and the ones he had not yet been asked to save. He counted the days until a fortnight. He counted the letters in the word components and the letters in the word breath and tried to accept that they were not the same and never would be. He put his head on his ledger and listened for a heartbeat and found a rustle that could be paper or could be a small animal settling. He closed his eyes because morning had declared itself and because men like him do not sleep; they adjourn.\n\nThe morning came with the small cruelty of details. The plant reported the gauges in the green and the engineer with the stutter sent a message that said Thank and then stopped because the word you is heavy and he had no one to lift it to. The Ritual Advisory Council issued a statement denying it existed and praising the goats for their service to public morale. The paper ran a headline that had been designed the day before and tweaked at dawn: Ledger Drowned; City Breathes. The SENSEFUL STREETS group put out a poster with a goat drawn badly and a speech bubble that said Accounting Is For Carnivores. A troupe of spider monkeys demonstrated, under a traffic light that had given up, how to cut paper without cutting fingers and the fifth monkey bled anyway and laughed because the city required it.\n\nAt noon, the sugar letter arrived not at his apartment, not at the office, but in the hands of the capuchin on the tram. The monkey did not joke. It put the paper into Ephraim\u2019s hand with a dead seriousness that felt like a ceremony. He unfolded it because you cannot refuse an oar when you are in water. The hand was the same careful hand, the ink the same cheap kind. It said, in a smaller, more cramped line, We are not satisfied with paper and goats. This is large arithmetic. The thing in the south is greedy. The bright snow is a clause you do not control. In fourteen nights, the winter comes if the appetite is not met. It smelled not of sugar but of ash, and the ash tasted, when he licked his finger and touched it, like the inside of a matchbook.\n\n\u201cWhat do we do,\u201d the capuchin asked, as if it were begging him to say something human. \u201cWho do we bite if biting does not fix the sky.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe buy more time,\u201d he said, because a man in his job ends every sentence that way. \u201cWe do not let them put a mouth on the wrong thing. We keep the bridges open. We breathe until the numbers change. We ask the river to help and we give it everything we have that is not a boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNumbers are bones,\u201d the capuchin said solemnly, as if remembering something he had learned from a woman with a scarf and a boy with blue hair. \u201cWe can throw bones to dogs and the dogs will be happy. We cannot throw bones to winter. Winter wants houses.\u201d\n\nHe nodded. The tram swayed. The girl with the calculus book underlined something with a pencil that had lost its eraser and then looked out the window at a sign where someone had painted over the word STOP with the words KEEP BREATHING. He wrote the last line of the sugar letter into his pocket ledger because you must write down the words that try to command you so that they are subject to a list. He closed the book and put his hand over it like a lid because some days you give your stomach a little win and pretend it is a strategy.\n\nThat night, when he unlocked his door, there was a smell he could not place. It was not gas, it was not bread, it was not the candle from a woman who wielded theater like a wrench. It was a sweetness that had gone bad without spoiling. He followed it down the hall and found the refrigerator ajar. Inside, where he had been keeping the notes chilled like fish you swear you will not cook, there was no paper. There was a hole in the frost where paper edges had been. There was a single olive he had not put there. He touched the olive with his forefinger. It had a bite gone from it. On the inside of the refrigerator door, someone had drawn a mouth with a marker in the wrong hand. The mouth had a tongue. The tongue extended, as jokes sometimes do, too far. He shut the door and the bulb went dark and he stood with his hand on the handle and decided, again, that he would not decide today. He would decide tomorrow, which is to say he would have to decide tonight in secret and hope morning would be fooled.\n\nOn his chair, someone had left a book. It was the old kind, the smell of a basement and a church and a stack of winter sweaters. The title had rubbed off except for the word Accounts. Inside, on the first page, in a grandmother hand, a sentence: If we must count, we will count with our mouths closed. He sat with it and the night annoyed the window and somewhere a monkey laughed and somewhere a man wept and somewhere a machine thought it would be a beautiful thing to break. He closed his own mouth and held his breath until his chest said please and then he let it out slowly and wrote the number one on the blank next page without ink.

The notes were gone, the olive with the bite still sat in its ridiculous solitude, and the drawn mouth on the inside door looked smug in the way that only ink can look when it thinks it has made a point. He wiped the marker mouth away with the rough side of a sponge and thought of the phrase clean slate and how it never once in his life had meant clean. He made coffee the way a man fortifies himself for a conversation he cannot win, pressed his thumb into the dent he had written on his own page the night before, and felt how the paper fought back gently, not a refusal so much as a reminder that even fibrous things have a spine.\n\nHart let himself into the office without knocking, which had become his way of loving people in a crisis, and stood by the window with his tie looped once and then given up on, as if it were a sentence that had found it had said enough. \u201cWe have twelve days,\u201d he said without preface, as if they were both mid-prayer and had forgotten to fold their hands. \u201cWe have trucks that think they are shy and a plant that wants lullabies and a Council that has translated appetite into font size. We have bridges that remember what men with chains were for.\u201d He slapped a paper on the desk that had been printed with a municipal seriousness that tried to make itself appear inevitable. \u201cEpsilon, manual. Darla blessed it with her highlighter. She found you the names of the men who still teach chains to listen. They keep the keys in a locker labeled \u2018Mascots\u2019 because the city is embarrassed by muscle.\u201d\n\nThe GIS analyst called on a channel so quiet it sounded as if she were phoning through cloth. \u201cI taught the map a new word,\u201d she said. \u201cTheta. The overlay insists on turning the vanishing tooth into a mouth again on nights when our power lines dream of their childhood. 999 Cherry\u2019s ghost is back, not as a building but as a route. The overlay says Bright Bridges Temporary will run a convoy through the cannery at the hour of doubt. They renamed the truck icon \u2018festival.\u2019 It\u2019s a whim and a lie and a plan.\u201d She mailed him the picture and he watched the gray block ghost in and out, learned its rhythm, counted the intervals the way a woman counts contractions when she wants time to behave.\n\nLark arrived with a rabbit-warren of rolled paper and the bone tally like a wand he had refused a job in a children\u2019s movie to keep. He set the maps on the desk and weighed their corners with staplers because scholars are the only men left who have weights handy. \u201cAttestations moved out of the churchy spaces,\u201d he said with a cheer he refused to name grief. \u201cWe\u2019ve got breath on paper from nine wards and a stray from the airport. Teens are breathing on the backs of their math homework because they like the wrongness. They\u2019re turning the breath page over to see the ghost of their equations and they think that\u2019s magic. It is, a little. Rory\u2019s piece taught them a mouth. They are doing it without the music sometimes and sometimes with, and the monkeys are watching and trying the count on their fingers and pretending they don\u2019t care when the number five licks their brain.\u201d He held up a page dented with a hundred patient exhales and said very softly, to himself, \u201cThat ought to be worth a chain.\u201d\n\nAt the plant the engineer with the stutter met him with a spoon he had wrapped in a paper towel as if it were an heirloom. \u201cThey put gum on the valve,\u201d he said, the g of gum heavy, and Ephraim thought of boys in alleys and wives with black aprons and monkeys with nothing to do and all of the city\u2019s fingers pressed into mistakes. \u201cI don\u2019t know who. I don\u2019t ask. I scraped it with this. My mother said never throw away a spoon that fits your hand. I might be arrested for saying it, but I want you to have it.\u201d The spoon\u2019s bowl had a notch worn by soup and by time. It felt like a tongue trying to make a number better by tasting it. He slid it into his jacket pocket with a care that was not for metal but for the stories that choose to hitch a ride there.\n\nThe Cultural Affairs woman asked for a walk by the river and did not light a candle. \u201cBe practical,\u201d she said, and then laughed at herself because she sounded like a person who sells pillows. \u201cMy deputy\u2014June\u2014put ash on the notes with a finger she dipped in an old tin I keep on my desk for emergencies and ghosts. She wrote them on my paper with my pen and wept about you in the bathroom because she was ashamed of doing the thing she thought would save the city. She is not a villain. She is an employee with a daughter named May, and the world told her that if you do not make the ritual strong you get winter for dessert.\u201d The apology sat between them like a dog that had learned it was allowed on furniture now. \u201cI removed her from the line where words turn to summonses,\u201d she added. \u201cI did not fire her because the city might need later the kind of woman who can smell when the floor is going to give.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does Theta buy,\u201d he asked. He watched a cormorant go under as if it had seen a ledger in the water it needed to balance.\n\n\u201cLeverage,\u201d she said, adjusting her scarf as if she could arrange her soul with wool. \u201cInsurers hold it. A contractor whose trucks have cherries on them holds it. A lobbyist who can make the word contingency sound like a meal holds it. Theta is a club over our head. Every hour we buy by making a meal out of paper, they will try to sell back to us at markup. We\u2019re paying an interest rate in fear. The clause isn\u2019t a law. It\u2019s a mood at a conference table. I\u2019m saying this out loud because we are running out of time to tell the truth in full sentences.\u201d\n\nHe went to Miriam for the part of this kind of day where you allow something to be obvious in front of someone who won\u2019t sell it. She had pulled the curtains half-closed so the apartment looked like a memory of itself. \u201cIrreversible,\u201d she said, serving him a pear on a plate that had belonged to their grandmother so old it had wood in it. \u201cThe mandrill asked for something we can\u2019t walk back. I thought of shaving my head and decided I\u2019m not sentimental about hair in that direction. I thought of taking the sign off the countinghouse and writing museum in chalk so it could be erased. I thought of writing uncle on the ground outside the Hall and rubbing it out with my heel until the word cried. Then I thought of olive pits, which do a sneaky thing with permanence. You eat the olive. You spit the pit. The pit lingers on the ground making promises. I want to make a pit with the city. Something we plant.\u201d She stabbed the pear with her knife in a way that made the pear feel like victory and then pulled back because she saw his face. \u201cWe could shut a lane that leads to the cannery forever and make it a strip of garden,\u201d she said more gently. \u201cA literal barrier between the pallets and the street. They can\u2019t drive vans through a trellis if the trellis holds beans.\u201d\n\nThe mandrill held court on a library roof, because monkeys choose their rooms by the quality of ledges, and listened to her cousins\u2019 arguments with a kind of patient boredom that told you she had learned more than you thought from watching committees. The juvenile rhesus, feeling the moon fatten whether or not he believed in it, insisted on eyebrows again with an affection that made his rudeness almost lovely. The chimp rapped his knuckles on the skylight and stared into the reading room where three humans had fallen asleep with newspapers on their faces, and the mandrill said in her old-longshoreman voice that hair wreaths hung at every door would satisfy the old ones for a season if they smelled like dog and if the wreaths were taken to the river after. She said, too, that if anyone cut a girl\u2019s hair without asking, she would bite them on the hand so that the scar would be a reason forever not to do it again. The rhesus nodded solemnly like a page accepting a task, and then, being fifteen in spirit, attempted to steal a bookmark from a man below and failed twice and then succeeded once and felt the holy thrill of trivial theft.\n\nThey built a list and then they built a practice. Darla printed, stamped, collated, and put her lipstick on with a steadiness that made all the red in the city look like a promise and not a threat. She made \u201cbreath cards\u201d that were not cards, just paper heavy enough to take a fingernail, and the fingernail left a clear mark that no one could erase without cutting the page. She assigned runners to the bridges and scheduled calls as if scheduling were prayer. Hart found the goat man leaning on a fence talking softly to an animal who did not need human words and made him promise three times that he would accept apples and not ask for changes in the law as payment. The goat man, whose name was Salim and who owned two pairs of socks that had learned to love mud, agreed to bring the cleanest, hungriest mouths in the city to the Hall for a second contract of silence.\n\nThe night sent an emissary to him in the form of a woman sitting on the cannery steps with her shoes off and her stockings rolled around her ankles like two different regrets. June, the deputy, did not stand when he stopped. She offered him a cigarette she did not light as if she were making a joke for a movie that liked to show competence as ruin. \u201cI\u2019m not sorry enough,\u201d she said plainly. \u201cI wrote the notes because in every meeting I sat in men made euphemisms until I wanted to drag my face on carpet. I thought if I put the fear in pretty, you\u2019d obey the pretty. It worked and it didn\u2019t. It always works and it never does. I\u2019m fired in the way that keeps my health insurance, which is how this city breaks your heart without technically doing anything wrong.\u201d She lifted her head. \u201cTheta isn\u2019t just a clause. It\u2019s a specific mischief. There are three warehouses with tanks that would behave like a bad winter if they were convinced it was their time. Two are guarded. One is watched by a man who plays cards with our enemies. He\u2019s not a villain either. He\u2019s lonely.\u201d She slid him a list folded so tight he needed his thumbnail to pry it open. \u201cThere is so much to guard that we will fail. There is, maybe, just enough to love that the failure will not be the kind that steals breath. Do not forgive me now. I don\u2019t want to write that scene.\u201d\n\nOn the last day before the moon did its old theater, the city performed a blasphemous rehearsal. Powder fell from a rooftop along a block in the Ward with the broken clock, tossed from five-gallon buckets by boys who had been promised a hardness by a man on a phone who had never once stood and watched a sky remember how to behave. The powder wreathed the block and tongues found it the way tongues find worry. The monkeys shrieked and then acted sick and then laughed and then were still, which was the strangest part. Hydrants were opened by men who had pulled their whole lives and watched the pretend ash turn to paste that never forgot its baptism. A goat wandered in from a lot and licked the paste with a look of someone willing to try any food once. The powder turned the goat\u2019s chin gray. The goat shook its head, sneezed, and trotted away with an air of disappointment that read like an editorial. The men with the buckets watched their theater melt and did not clap. The Cultural Affairs woman arrived with a mop and the mayor with a rolled-up plan he forgot to unfurl and the mandrill with her jaw tight. \u201cYou think snow is cheap,\u201d she said to no one and everyone. \u201cWait until you have to sweep.\u201d Ephraim wrote in his ledger: practice panic, sweep, kebab for the men who opened the valves, no notes.\n\nHarvest night came dressed as itself. The moon had the confidence of an elder who has outlived everybody\u2019s taste. The Hall of Balances smelled like unwashed wool and ink. The wreath on the door looked foolish until it didn\u2019t. The bowl glared, which is a trick bowls know. The ledger lay open to the part where deceit narrows like a river into usable pain. The goat man stood by with his hand on his favorite\u2019s head, and the favorite looked at him with a devotion so stupid it could save a family from a fire. The bridges waited for chains and hands. Public Works checked the manual cranks with banana fingers in gloves. The monkeys took their places in different trees than last time as if to test the city\u2019s reflexes.\n\nThey did not speak the boy\u2019s name. They did not even say boy. The mayor said ledger and saw that nobody flinched and then said ledger again softly as if it were a lullaby his mother might have hummed if the world had been something else. Ephraim cut the lines and laid them in the bowl. Each strip of paper seemed to say please, and he could not tell if the paper begged to be eaten or to be spared the indignity of metaphor. Miriam stood in the back with olives and made a face like a gate that keeps. Lark made the cross of someone else\u2019s religion over the bone tally and told it under his breath that it was doing very well. The mandrill watched and breathed only when the chimp breathed, as if to braid the act into a rope that might hold more than animal.\n\nThe powder-droppers, having been humiliated by hydrants, tried again in a subtler place, the roof of the post office where the city hides the letters that hurt. The capuchin who had stolen a stapler days before used it to hit the elbow of the boy about to spill and said, in a tone of casual companionship, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d The boy\u2019s face did the quick arithmetic of dignity; he looked at the city, the moon, his own hand, and then he put the bucket down and sat with his legs over the edge so that everyone who looked up had to consider human ankles. It was not heroism. It was posture re-taught.\n\nWhen the bowl was full enough that the rim tasted like kale, they carried it out. A woman tripped and a man caught her under the elbow and she kissed him without thinking as if luck had to be thanked with mouth. The goats ate the names they were given and let the rest go river. Chains clanked on three bridges and the fourth refused because it had pride and a bad hinge, and four men with hands like history pulled anyway while a troop of rhesus threw their bodies on the chain and felt a pleasure that the city could have used for different things if it had had the time. South, the plant clicked its clicks and the engineer counted, and a figure on a walkway at Warehouse Three, the one with the lonely man, put his phone away and lit a cigarette instead and told himself a story about his daughter in another place and the time he would tell her a story that made him look like a man.\n\nIn the Hall someone whispered nephew because there is always a person who insists on touching a hot stove, and the mandrill flicked her ear and a silence fell so sudden it felt like a new weather. The word hung a second and then died the way small fires die when rain picks a neighborhood to love. Hart laughed once under his breath as if he had seen an old joke learn manners. Darla distributed breath cards and told people sternly where to put their nail, and people obeyed because the sternness was full of love and because she had a face the city had agreed not to lie to. The Cultural Affairs woman watched the juvenile rhesus mouth the word ledger and shook like a girl who had rescued a dog from a road and was only now allowed to feel it.\n\nThe counter-rite played itself under a streetlight four blocks away, plastic knifery and a poster of a boy borrowed from somewhere that had nothing to do with this city. The crowd did not boo. It turned and walked and the knives fell with the dignity of toys abandoned by toddlers. The men who had brought the knives cried because they had not planned for a script without an ending. Rory filmed them with a gentleness that had edges, and later cut it into the piece that would make people in other cities stop pretending they have no cousins.\n\nAfter the bowl and the goats and the breath there was a bench. He sat on it because he could feel the shape of himself and it needed a flat thing. The capuchin sat beside him and handed him back the spoon he had forgotten he\u2019d given it, the engineer\u2019s spoon, wrapped again in the paper towel because the monkey had learned etiquette and was proud of knowing where to put its paws. \u201cYour sister\u2019s olives were better tonight,\u201d the capuchin said, and wiped its nose with the back of its hand like a child who has been told twelve times to use a napkin. \u201cI bit two men who said they wanted to do a prank and they agreed they did not. I will not bite as a hobby. I will bite as a craft. Tell your goats they did theater without lying.\u201d\n\nHe did not go home because home had the smell of refrigerator regret. He went to the river for a while and watched the skin of the water accept and deny and accept. The moon cupped its light the way a waitress brings coffee. The city made the sound cities make when large things are done and no one died: the kind of cheering you only let the air do for you. The Cultural Affairs woman appeared like a moral at the end of a story told by someone too tired for point and sat without asking if the bench had room. \u201cJune left a note,\u201d she said. \u201cNo sugar. She wrote in pencil, hard, so it left a valley. It said: I will stop making it worse. It said: If you need me to carry boxes in the rain I can do that and never once choose a noun. I like her again because she is a person. I will tell her daughter that her mother once fed a goat an ugly word and watched it disappear.\u201d\n\nHe slept late the next morning and woke to the particular quiet of a city putting itself back on its own lap. The plant\u2019s numbers texted themselves in polite green. The bridges were open, tasting their own usefulness like a metal tongue saying grace. The goat man sent a photo of his animals in a lot under a billboard that used to sell vacations and now just sold sky, their mouths still working with dream. SENSEFUL STREETS put out a poster that corrected its goat and called the rite bourgeois, a word that had lost all meaning in the year and was now just a sound you made when your mouth wanted to feel French. The mayor said in front of microphones that the Rite Advisory Council did not exist and that its meeting was postponed to a date that would be announced when the moon had learned to mind its own business.\n\nAt Kettle & Hart, the monkeys had braided ribbons out of the substitute scrip and were using them to try to tow a chair across the floor. Darla put a hand to her mouth as if to hide a spell and then declared loudly that if anyone put their teeth on her copier she would put their head in a file drawer, and four rhesus mimed decapitation and then apologized without being asked. Hart had drawn a goat on his whiteboard and given it a speech bubble that said Pay Your Debts to Rivers. He stood with his shoes off again and said, \u201cYou stole time and fed it to something that forgot to be angry at you. That\u2019s a trick. Don\u2019t do it again unless you have to.\u201d\n\nOn the tram a woman read a story to a boy with a winter hat in a month that had no right to need hats yet. He watched her mouth shape ledger with more care than he would have thought a stranger had for his private nouns. The capuchin slept, head on his shoe, like a dog with nothing to prove. When he reached his door there was no letter. He opened the refrigerator anyway and there, where the notes had been, was a bowl of olives wrapped in waxed paper with a note in Miriam\u2019s hand that said: You still have a mouth. He stood a long time with the door open tasting the cold and the brine and the possibility that abstaining had bought him something more than just a few hours of trucks. He shut the door not with triumph but with the carefulness of a man who knows he will be asked again and wants to be ready to be the same man twice if he can manage it. He took out his ledger and, with the spoon\u2019s bowl held to the page like a tracer, impressed, with no ink at all, a second number beside the first, and then a third, because sometimes the only way to teach your hands a mercy is to let them count how many times they have chosen not to be knives.",
