     "novel_text": "The tide tells lies. Or maybe I do. I can never quite tell which one of us starts it\u2014the long hiss of water pulling back over the rocks, the burr of my breath counting, the salt dampening my hairline while the sky sits dumb and bruised over Ocean Beach. The pier is a sketch in the half-light, an arm pointing into a gray that won\u2019t commit to morning, its barnacled elbow creaking to an old memory. I stand at the lip of the shore with a bag of salt and a bottle of rosemary oil and the copper coin Abuela keeps under the register for \u201cextra luck.\u201d I told myself I would come here to watch and nothing else, but the truth slides around like the foam, it gets into every space. I have always made circles when I\u2019m nervous.\n\nThe sand wants to swallow the circle before I finish it, like a mouth closing around a word. I trace faster, my finger cold, trying not to think about the way my heart is beating like a foot on a squeaky stair. I whisper the names of the soft things. Sea lettuce, eelgrass, cloud. My voice stumbles on cloud because the sky is just beginning to thin over Point Loma, letting a rash of pink show through, the same color as my first lipstick, the one Lina dared me to wear to finals. I press the copper coin into the center of the circle and rub rosemary on my wrists, the bottle clattering against my rings, my teeth clicking because I\u2019m chattering, though it\u2019s not actually that cold.\n\nThere\u2019s a tremor under the sand, a little sigh. Not a quake. A shrug. I learned to tell the difference before I learned to swim. Our part of the earth is always whispering like this, like a body muttering through a dream. Abuela says that\u2019s where the old spells fit best, under the talk, inside the place where things rub against each other. \u201cYou?\u201d she told me, tapping my forehead. \u201cYou are all thresholds, Marisol.\u201d She says my full name when she wants me to listen. \u201cFind your doors.\u201d\n\nA gull watches me, head cocked, his eyes the ridiculous yellow of plastic toys. He\u2019s missing two toes. When he hops closer, dragging his foot just enough to make me want to cry, I tell myself not to give him the coin. The ocean keeps and keeps; I cannot keep anything from it. I get down on my knees, jeans biting damp into my skin, and whisper my own names. Sol. Mari. The middle one only Abuela uses when she is trying to soften my stubbornness. I\u2019m twenty-six and I still bring her jars and money and my worst ideas for her to fix. I came here because of the card that fell out of her deck after dinner, The Tower, which was either an accident or a joke or a sign, and because Jude called me at midnight to say the kelp beds were strange up the coast, torn all to weird lace, \u201clike somebody chewed them,\u201d he said on the phone, whispering like he had a secret. Jude loves a secret like a lemon loves a knife.\n\nI pour the salt in a trickle with my left hand, because that\u2019s the side I lie on to sleep. Something about habit being a kind of promise. Something about promises being the only magic that matters. I never know if that\u2019s mine or Abuela\u2019s or a book I left open in high school and never finished. I talk again, this time to the water because that is who I am\u2014a witch from San Diego, the kind that still carries quarters for the trolley, who doesn\u2019t have a cat because the last cat knew too much and it made her a little uneasy, who keeps an old T-shirt in the trunk of her car for when the winter storms slap you and you give in and go, and then have to stop shaking before you can drive home. That kind.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d I tell the water. \u201cPlease not yet.\u201d\n\nThe gull opens his beak like he\u2019s laughing.\n\nA wave shoulders another wave and they break together, slopping right into my circle. The coin blinks, lifts like an eye, and is gone. It happens so fast that I don\u2019t even gasp. I just sit there with salt in my lap while the water moves back like a cat who doesn\u2019t want to admit it cares.\n\n\u201cTake it, take it, everybody eats,\u201d I say, and my laugh feels hollow. Across the street there is a coffee shop already open, bleary lights and a handful of old men holding paper cups like they\u2019re candles in a vigil. There\u2019s a woman jogging by with a dog that looks like a piece of licorice. The pier groans. I press my palms into the cold sand and try to listen deeper than the morning\u2014under the combers, under the ratchety noise of the lifeguard truck, under the thing that woke me in the first place, the anxious little needle of it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s inside me or above me. I just know it\u2019s here.\n\n\u201cSol!\u201d someone calls, not too close. I look back over my shoulder, pushing hair out of my mouth, and Jude is there, in a hooded sweatshirt that says Sea Dragon, which is the coffee shop he both works at and constantly threatens to quit. He\u2019s holding two cups, the tops haloed with steam, and one of his shoes is untied. He waves the coffee like a flag. \u201cAre you summoning or sulking?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t yell the S-words. You\u2019ll bring cops,\u201d I say, standing, brushing salt off my knees. The gull has hopped into the circle and is stabbing at the line with his beak. \u201cYou\u2019re too on the nose,\u201d I tell him, and he blinks.\n\nJude shuffles down the short slope of sand, his hair still stuck in sleep spirals. He has the prettiest eyelashes of anyone I know. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, which is our oldest joke and our most serious question.\n\nI take the cup. \u201cOkay-ish. The ocean took my coin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always will,\u201d he says, kicking at a lump of sand like he can bully it into being something else. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the kelp beds?\u201d he adds, then looks guilty, because he\u2019s the reason I\u2019m fixating. His face is a map of his thoughts and you can see the routes he takes to dodge something.\n\n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d I say. \u201cYou saw them.\u201d\n\nHe nods, a quick flick. \u201cThey look like they\u2019ve been dissolved by\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Lemon. Or spit.\u201d He snorts at himself. \u201cI\u2019m a poet. Anyway, it\u2019s weird. I know weird in the water.\u201d He glances at my half circle and the gull, who has gotten his beak stuck in the salt line in a way that makes me think a lot of things I can\u2019t say out loud without making them real. \u201cStop doing that with your face,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re folding in half.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that like it\u2019s helpful,\u201d I mutter, and we drink our coffee and watch the long heave of the ocean. \u201cAbuela\u2019s card jumped out like a frog,\u201d I say after a minute. \u201cThe Tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cYikes. Maybe she sneezed.\u201d His eyes are on the pier. \u201cTheo says they\u2019re going to close it again if the storm takes two more boards. He says they always say that but this time he believes them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pier never closes,\u201d I say, hoarding my superstition.\n\n\u201cEverything closes eventually. My mom\u2019s going to move to Yuma.\u201d We both consider the desolation of that. We look at the gull again, because it's easier than looking at each other when catastrophe sneaks so close to regular news. \u201cYou want me to pretend I didn\u2019t call you? And you can pretend you slept until your alarm and didn\u2019t sneak out to do\u2026 that?\u201d He gestures at the circle.\n\n\u201cI want you to pretend you're psychic and tell me the thing I won\u2019t listen to anyway,\u201d I say. He puts his hand over his heart like I stabbed him. Then he leans into me for a second, shoulder to shoulder, warm.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re destined for something stupid and enormous,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have the nose for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the my-mother\u2019s-nose for it,\u201d I grumble. And I do. It\u2019s this particular slope, this way of smelling rain before San Diego remembers how to do it. Marion Vega had that nose and her dimple and the habit of tapping her teeth when she thought. She died when I was fifteen in a car that wasn\u2019t ours, with a man we didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s the clean version. The other versions multiply like ants in summer; you shut a door and find them in your sugar anyway. It\u2019s easier to say: she went west one day and never really came back. So I keep her nose and I keep the things that rhyme with it. Superstitions. Lists. Salt.\n\nWe walk back up to the street. The light is a better color now, less bruised. In the shop window, a man is kissing a baby on its ridiculous cap while a woman watches him like he invented that day. Jude doesn\u2019t tie his shoe. He never trips, which is one of his many wrong magics.\n\n\u201cYou coming by after shift?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m making cinnamon rolls or something that wants to be cinnamon rolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to work at the shop. Abuela says there\u2019s a woman coming in for a smoke bundle and she wants me to make the kind with the rosemary and the scruffy sage. The scratchy one.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe could do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants me to practice my\u2014\u201d I wave a hand. The whole of the word \u201cdiscipline\u201d is too big for this morning. \u201cAnd she said the woman is strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange like cheap? Or strange like how? Like she asks for too many things to be free? Or like she collects teeth? Which is a thing, Sol, I swear.\u201d\n\nI unthinkingly put my fingers to my wrist where my bracelets tap. \u201cStrange like, she smells like cheese.\u201d\n\nJude laughs. It\u2019s loud, and that\u2019s nice, and the gull flaps up spooked, drops a bead of salt like a snowflake. \u201cOkay. This town really is a salad,\u201d he says. \u201cI gotta go, I gotta open before Theo decides to downsize my beans again.\u201d He kisses the air near my ear because he is a gay grandpa in a twenty-six-year-old body and heads across the street, waving. Ray of light, noise in my pocket.\n\nI stay at the end of the sand for another minute and then I go wash my hands in the sink that never has hot water, wiping them on my jeans when the paper towels cling like jellyfish. On the walk back to the car, my coffee cools. A bus sighs by with only one person on it. On the windshield someone has drawn a mustache on the surfer decal and it suits him. When I turn the key, the car coughs like I\u2019ve woken it rudely. I always feel like I\u2019m about to drive away in a dream when I pull out of that lot, like the lines of the asphalt will move under me, like years ago when Jude rode a skateboard holding onto the back bumper and I was sure he\u2019d become a kite.\n\nBarrio Logan is still busy even in the morning\u2014the trickle of tortilla smoke, the paint that never dries on that one wall where kids climb up each other\u2019s bodies to write their names higher and higher. Our shop is tucked into a little strip with a pawn shop on one side and a hair place on the other. There\u2019s a mural of a woman with six hands over our door. Her palms are painted with eyes and lemons. When I was a kid I used to pretend they blinked. Abuela says her cousin did the mural and didn\u2019t follow the sketch, and that the eyes were not originally part of the plan. This is how things happen to us. We plan with one hand, and the other gets possessed by whatever is louder.\n\nLa Sirena Luminosa has always smelled like dryer sheets and salt with a little undernote of lavender that Abuela swears she hates, but she keeps adding to the jars because \u201ccustomers like that scent,\u201d she says, making it sound like an accusation. I have a ladder of dried oranges and a rack of candles in the shapes of things people like to petition: house, heart, palm. I put my bag under the counter and press the funny button on the register that sticks and see what comes up from the stack of paper I crammed under it yesterday. A receipt from the taco truck. A photo of me and Lina with our faces smushed together in the bathroom mirror at after prom. A napkin with a smear of butter. I stick the napkin back down and the photo in my pocket. I click my tongue quietly the number of times my mother used to; a static in the air answers me, like cling wrap.\n\n\u201cClose the door all the way,\u201d Abuela calls from the back room. \u201cIt\u2019s early, and there are flies already. The world is mostly flies.\u201d\n\nI do. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman coming,\u201d I say because I like the sound of making a story before it happens.\n\n\u201cThere are two women coming,\u201d Abuela says. I can hear her bracelets sliding up her arm as she moves. The back room has rugs and a big jar of coins and it\u2019s always too warm. She comes out like she always does\u2014like there\u2019s a song she can hear that she hopes will stop when she opens the next door. She has a towel on her shoulder like she\u2019s a bartender. \u201cI like your shirt,\u201d she says, which is one way she says she loves me. And: \u201cThis morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe water took the coin. Jude says the kelp looks chewed.\u201d\n\nAbuela\u2019s mouth clicks open and closed. Her hair is pinned up with three brown bobby pins that all point different ways. There\u2019s a smear of flour or ash on her temple. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give what you need to the water,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will only learn your taste.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d I say, which is true at least half the time she talks.\n\n\u201cIt means be stingy. with yourself.\u201d She taps my chin, breathes. \u201cThe woman who smells like cheese,\u201d she adds, turning to the shelf with the rosemary and the scuffed sage. \u201cI do not know her. I do not think I have known her, but she looks like one I have met already. It\u2019s possible she smells like the truth. That can be sour, too.\u201d She hands me a bundle. \u201cMake this one tight. She will pull at anything loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can handle difficult customers,\u201d I say, puffing up, and drop the bundle and have to crouch to catch it.\n\n\u201cYou can. Yes,\u201d she says in a way that makes the yes mean three other things. \u201cAlso Jude called me to tell me he loves you and he should be the one to marry you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gay,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cPlease. Since when is that the only thing people are?\u201d\n\nWe laugh, and then the door opens on a chime that is not ours. It is sharper, a little higher, like a glass throat. The smell slides in first, careful and insistent, like a poem. My nose tells my head the story before my eyes can catch up. It\u2019s sharp as the rind of something hard and aged; it's soft as a stinky stripe unwrapped at a picnic; there\u2019s a sweetness like hay and the whisper of mold\u2014blue and brave. It makes my tongue waxy. It\u2019s so unusual in a place that always smells like rosemary and stubborn women that my shoulders lift without me asking them to.\n\nShe\u2019s wearing a yellow dress, a true yellow, not butter not mustard, not the color of eggs, a color I can\u2019t name because it keeps changing as she steps through the doorway. She has hair that does what it wants and a face I want to rearrange the features of in my mind\u2014like, the nose is smaller than I first thought, the mouth larger, the eyes a very soft brown until there\u2019s light in them and then they are the color of amber so old a mosquito might be frozen in it. Her mouth has the kind of lipstick you don\u2019t see unless you\u2019re wearing it or kissing it. She carries a tote with a wedge printed on it, BASTA! CHEESE in a font that feels like it\u2019s about to yodel.\n\n\u201cBuenos d\u00edas,\u201d she says, pronouncing it right and wrong at once, like someone who learned to say things late, who will never not be slightly amazed by a word on her tongue. She smiles. She does not show teeth. \u201cYou must be Marisol.\u201d\n\nMy body calls me by my name in response, like the way you stand up when a teacher looks at you. \u201cHi,\u201d I say, flicking rosemary dust off my fingers onto my jeans. \u201cThat\u2019s me. Can I\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one at the pier. That\u2019s what they say,\u201d she says, and I must look startled enough that she laughs. It has a small echo in it. \u201cNo one told me their secrets, don\u2019t worry. You smell like the kind of girl who doesn\u2019t sleep right.\u201d\n\nAbuela makes the sound she makes when she\u2019s found a burr in the couch. \u201cCan we help you?\u201d she asks, a little too bright.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a bundle,\u201d the woman says, bringing her palms together like prayer and pressing them to her nose briefly as if she might fall asleep if she doesn\u2019t. \u201cSomething with rosemary and, mmm, neighborhood sage. Not precious sage. More like a little rude. I\u2019m Mireya. Mireya Moho.\u201d The last name, I feel like she placed it on the counter like a piece of fruit she wants me to cut.\n\n\u201cMoho,\u201d I say automatically. \u201cMold.\u201d It slips out, and she tilts her head. Her skin smells like something that grew alone in a cave and wanted to be loved anyway.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take it personally,\u201d she says. \u201cI take it chemically.\u201d She grins, showing a tooth that is turned just slightly sideways, like a girl waiting to run. \u201cI make cheeses. I think you know this. I have a table at the Little Italy Saturday market. You should come by. We all grow something.\u201d Her eyes flick to the candles\u2014heart, house, palm\u2014and back. \u201cI\u2019m new to this neighborhood. I like to pay my respects quickly. The winds are wrong lately. Have you noticed?\u201d\n\nAbuela\u2019s bracelets talk to each other as she moves. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed all kinds of things. We\u2019re busy. Do you want the bundle or do you want to talk to my granddaughter all day? Because she likes to talk, and you won\u2019t leave alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not in a hurry. I\u2019m always arriving and leaving at once,\u201d she says lightly. \u201cBundles are good. But also, I think I\u2019ll buy\u2014\u201d She leans in toward a shelf and inhales. She doesn\u2019t touch. She\u2019s elegant about not touching. \u201c\u2014this oil. And that candle that looks like a hand. The one with the chipped knuckle. It feels honest.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m wrapping the bundle tighter than anybody deserves to wrap a bundle, my fingers doing that machine rhythm they do when I\u2019m trying not to shake. The smell of her is not loud, but it\u2019s thorough; it follows any space that opens. \u201cDo you know Jude?\u201d I ask, because I am rude sometimes, because I am trying to make her ordinary.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows Jude,\u201d she says, smiling into her hand, then into the strap of her tote, then up at me through her hair like it\u2019s a whole new person. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know him. Not the way you do. Yet.\u201d She puts a thin roll of cash on the counter and a small square wrapped in wax paper on top of it. \u201cA gift. From me to you. A little Parmesan to make your coffee into a soup.\u201d She laughs at my expression. \u201cPeople fear what is rude on the tongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople also fear presents,\u201d Abuela murmurs.\n\nMireya lifts one shoulder. My body wants to take a step back and a step closer at once. Sometimes I think this city keeps people who don\u2019t belong anywhere else and makes us feel like the same-sized wrong thing\u2014like we could line up and make a bridge out of us.\n\n\u201cYou did not answer my question,\u201d she says softly. \u201cHave you noticed the winds?\u201d No one who is from here asks about wind in the plural like that. The Santa Ana likes to come by herself.\n\n\u201cThe pier\u2019s talking,\u201d I say before I can stop myself. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a\u2026 tremble. Like the freeway when everyone is smiling at the same time.\u201d I dig in my mouth with my tongue to find a word I dropped. \u201cLike the shore is reciting something. A first line.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. The winds are moving backwards,\u201d she says, and her face doesn\u2019t move much when she says that. \u201cEverything is going to smell like something else for a while.\u201d\n\nShe pays. She lifts the bundle, almost reverent. She does not wink. She does not do anything that twitchy women do to make you love them. She simply exists like a thing that\u2019s had time to realize it has the right to be in its own body. When she leaves, her dress bellies out a little, like it has a weather pattern of its own. The smell of her stays. I can feel it on my wrists, in the little pocket of air between my top lip and my teeth. It\u2019s not unpleasant. It\u2019s just definite. It\u2019s like learning a word so well that your mouth knows it without you. Abuela rubs the counter with her towel like she\u2019s wiping off fingerprints.\n\n\u201cDo you know her?\u201d I ask, and she gives me the face she makes when she\u2019s about to lie or tell a story instead of an answer.\n\n\u201cThere are only fourteen women in the world and they take turns being everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cYes? No? She smells like the old churches we used to go to when we were pretending to be other things. Those candles that burn crooked. She smells like the way rot helps us grow. Teaches us to let go or we will be eaten alive. And also like the rich people\u2019s picnic.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a witch,\u201d I say, because it is easier to label than to untangle all of the little strings. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not like you. She\u2019s like a rock in a place where rocks will eventually be sand,\u201d Abuela says. \u201cBe careful. Do not be rude. Did she leave a thing for you?\u201d\n\nI pull the wax paper parcel toward me, sniff it, and then I laugh because of course I do. \u201cIt\u2019s cheese,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always cheese when she leaves,\u201d Abuela says, like we have discussed this before. I almost say that\u2014like we have discussed this before\u2014but I swallow it, because sometimes the feeling of that trick is the way dreams bleed into a day. She looks down at the cash. She looks at me. Her mouth is a pen cap that someone chewed. \u201cDo not eat it,\u201d she says, and I nod, and I put it under the register on top of the napkin, on top of that butter smear I can feel with my fingers even after I wash my hands.\n\nThe rest of the morning is slow and then briefly silly. A man comes in and buys a candle shaped like a tiny baby and tells me he wants to stop his neighbor from drumming because he has a migraine and a baby would surely help with that, and he stares me down when I try to explain that the candles aren\u2019t dolls. A woman buys a book because it has a gold snake on the cover and then tells me she doesn\u2019t read but loves plots. A group of teenagers come in and smell everything. A girl with a scab on her lip says, \u201cDoes this have\u2026 will this help?\u201d and she doesn\u2019t show me what this is, just looks past me at the shelf with the oils like it is a museum of answers. I want to hand her my own front door and say, knock whenever you need to. I sell her the cheap things that actually work and I tell her to put honey under her tongue and then bite down. She looks at me like I stole something. She looks at me like I gave her something. We make change. This is also magic.\n\nAt two I take my break and sit on the back steps and eat the tortilla roll-ups Abuela makes me when she remembers. There\u2019s a cat back there that belongs to nobody and all of us. It looks at me with that disdain that is actually a long love. I can hear the trolley thrum and the little clack of the neighbor\u2019s wind chimes. When a gust hits that shouldn\u2019t exist, hot as a breath from a person who has just told a lie, it presses against my skin like a warning. I think of Mireya saying winds in the plural. I think of The Tower card, that click of many things about to be one thing. I think of how easy it is to start talking to yourself without your mouth moving. I nap with my eyes open for a minute and see my mother\u2019s hands sorting buttons. I wake up with the taste of copper in my throat. The cat is making biscuits on my thigh and I have to peel him off gently even though I\u2019d like to be kneaded.\n\nAt four we are papered in light. The kind of light that feels like a polite hand on the back telling you to hurry up or the bus leaves. My phone buzzes. Jude: Come by. I made the cinnamon rolls into something else. I tell Abuela I\u2019m running out. She watches me like the street might eat me this time, not later.\n\nSea Dragon smells like burnt sugar and tired college students. There\u2019s a new kid working who gives change with both hands like he learned that at church. Jude is slicing something gooey and proud, a pan of sticky squares that could be rolls or could be a mistake. He bows when I walk in. He is a host in a house that is actually a ship.\n\n\u201cI met her,\u201d I say. \u201cMireya Moho. She smells like a picnic you forgot in the sun. In a good way,\u201d I add, mouth full, because the cinnamon whatevers are ridiculous, buttery, the kind of sweet that makes your mouth not know what to do with talk for a second.\n\n\u201cI knew you would,\u201d he says, bobbing his head like a pigeon. \u201cShe came by yesterday. Asked me if the air conditioning is a spell. I told her yes. Isn\u2019t it? She\u2019s the one I told you about with the cheeses. There was a cloud of bees around her table at the market last week like a halo.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe left me a piece of Parmesan,\u201d I say. \u201cWhich feels like sending someone a photograph of your mother. It feels\u2026 intimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is intimate to you. I\u2019m jealous. Tell me about her dress. Tell me about the way she said her name.\u201d\n\nI tell him. We arrange and rearrange the details like dominoes, making patterns that could be anything until they aren\u2019t. He puts a square in a paper boat and hands it to a kid with a skateboard without making him pay. \u201cDonation to the youth,\u201d he says. The kid says, \u201cK,\u201d which is a blessing in a language I do not have. We talk about the wind. The air inside feels like it is still deciding whether to be cool or hot. If I close my eyes, I can hear the waves behind the noise of the espresso machine. I wonder if the ocean is doing that thing where, after a long day, it forgets to hold itself up and just lies there briefly and thinks of nothing.\n\nAt six, when the light has gone to that tin color that makes you a little sad, I walk down India Street to the end where the market packs itself up into pickup trucks. There\u2019s always someone still selling something out of a cooler, too tired to make change with their mouth. The grocer with the peaches that bruise themselves with arrogance is like a king. His name is Salvador. He kisses me on both cheeks and says, \u201cGirl, your hair.\u201d Maybe it looks like a storm that doesn\u2019t want to come. I buy grapes the size of thumbs. I find Mireya\u2019s table because I can smell it before I see it, even in this crowd, even in this soup. She has wheels and wedges and a pale gray goat cheese the color of some polite disappointment. There are children tying themselves into knots under the tablecloth and a woman in a hat who keeps trying to make the words \u201cSharp as my husband\u201d into a joke.\n\n\u201cYou came,\u201d Mireya says without looking up at first. Her fingers are a choreography with the knife, the paper, the scale. She wipes between cuts with a cloth she\u2019s tied around her wrist like a handkerchief waiting for a fever. \u201cI thought you would.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you thought I would,\u201d I say because I have never been smooth in my life. \u201cI brought no money with me on purpose.\u201d Jude is in my ear telling me not to flirt with girls who are not looking at me exactly the way I want them to. I wipe my palms on my skirt and try to look like a passerby. It\u2019s like pretending not to look at your own shadow.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. We barter,\u201d she says, slicing me a piece of something that is the exact color of the wall in my grandparents\u2019 hallway. It smells like a barn and caramel and tears. \u201cTell me the news and I\u2019ll give you something that will force your mouth to make a face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wind,\u201d I say, because I am a joke of a woman. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s going backwards.\u201d\n\nShe tilts her head. The knife waits. \u201cI already told you that. Unless I didn\u2019t. Unless I told you with my face.\u201d She glances up at the sky like it owes her a favor. \u201cThe bees in my boxes were nervous this morning. They danced funny\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always dance,\u201d a customer interjects.\n\n\u201cEverything dances,\u201d Mireya says. \u201cBut it was different. Worry is a rhythm, too. I can hear it from the way you breathe,\u201d she says to me, suddenly, walking her eyes across my face, slow, like her pupils are spell pieces. \u201cWhen do you sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the wrong time,\u201d I answer, and it feels like a confession and a lie. \u201cWhen do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen there is nothing else to do,\u201d she says, like she has never run out of anything else to do. \u201cTaste.\u201d\n\nThe cheese is rude and wonderful on my tongue, like a person who meets your mother and makes her cry with laughter. It fills my mouth with something like a word I can\u2019t remember. I close my eyes because I always do too much when I am trying not to do too little. When I open them, Mireya is watching my jaw move like she can read it. She hands a tiny wedge to a woman with a stroller and wraps two more in paper for a man with a mustache as if each piece is a story she is sending them home with, a thing that could undo them or teach them to say a different name when they wake up.\n\nShe gives me a piece of something softer. It sticks to the roof of my mouth. \u201cI have a question,\u201d she says, as if we are already in the middle of the remain of a game.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I say, because I am always waiting for a question.\n\n\u201cDo you want to save the world?\u201d she asks, as if she is asking if I want more water. As if she is asking whether I prefer goats or cows. \u201cWould you make that your job?\u201d\n\nBeside us, a man drops a crate. A child screams at the exact pitch of a dying pull toy. The wind lifts, then lies back down like a dog.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, because the truth is louder than my mouth. \u201cYes? I think. Sometimes. I don\u2019t also know what the world is. Or if it wants that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d she says simply. \u201cThis world does not want the saving you think it wants. It wants to be held while it does the things it will do anyway.\u201d She shrugs, like that\u2019s that. \u201cBut some of us are made to try, aren\u2019t we? Some of us are born with a hand that will not stay in our own pocket. Sometimes I smell that on people. Sometimes it stinks. Sometimes it\u2019s lovely.\u201d She taps the knife on the board, tap, tap. \u201cCareful. Everybody who saves something is also the one who opens the gate.\u201d\n\nI could ask her who taught her to say that. I could ask her what she wants from me besides the small power that comes from being the one holding the question. I could ask her where she learned to make a thing from warm milk that can be so sharp. I could ask her a thousand warm dumb things. Instead, I say, \u201cThere are seeds under our car again,\u201d because I\u2019ve plucked those little burrs off my socks three days in a row and I want to think it means something. I want to think everything is a letter addressed to me.\n\n\u201cEverything is,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might not be the right recipient. But the mailman doesn\u2019t know that. To him, every house is a house. You know?\u201d She smooths the paper. \u201cEat the gift. Or don\u2019t. But if you don\u2019t, do not throw it away. You shouldn\u2019t throw away a cow\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nAt home, night is late before it comes. I put the cheese in the bottom drawer like it\u2019s a sleeping mouse. I take a long shower and stand in it past the point where the hot goes out. My dreams start before I lie down. I can feel them crowding against the outside of my skull like people at a door. The first one is always water. The second one is my mother in her leather jacket at the stove with her hair doing that thing that used to make me think she had wings. I am small in that one, smaller than I ever was, because I keep wanting to go backwards and forwards at once. The third one is the pier, the boards a mouth, but the teeth are coins. I step inside. They don\u2019t bite.\n\nWhen I wake, my mouth is slick and my hands smell like rosemary, like I fell asleep at the shop. On the ceiling, the light from the street is making the shape of a ladder. It crawls up and up and ends in the corner where the paint peels. I reach up like a child and tap the air. I can feel the edge of something. You know the feeling. Like the way you can smell rain in other people\u2019s cities and know it is lonelier than yours. Like the breath you take right when someone is about to say your favorite part. Like the thumb pressing the dent in an apple and knowing it will bruise.\n\nI drive to the pier. This is stupid; I do it. The night has thinned out to that time when everyone who should be asleep is either crying or telling a cab driver their best story. I park crooked and no one slaps a ticket on me because the world is too busy doing its thing. There are\u2014no other way to put it\u2014coins glittering on the wet sand like someone cracked a slot machine. A black gull lands beside me and drops something. It is mean-looking, this gull, with a nick out of one wing like it lost a sentence in a fight. It cock eyes me and the thing between its feet shines wrong, pearly. I bend. It\u2019s a shell, but it has a face in it, or I think it does until I blink and it\u2019s just a thumbprint. The gull hops to the edge of the water and back like it\u2019s drawing me a map.\n\nThe tide is wrong. It is farther out than it should be, and then it creeps farther still. In a breath, it feels like if I take one step, I will fall over the edge of the world where it has unrolled itself and left a lip for us to look over. Behind me, someone hums. I turn because I am my mother\u2019s daughter and I don\u2019t believe in not looking at the thing that\u2019s behind you. There\u2019s nobody there. There is my car and the streetlight and the idea of someone who could have been leaning against the rail. The hum persists. It is inside my mouth. It is the hum my jaw makes before a cry.\n\n\u201cMarisol,\u201d says a voice I have already named even before I hear it, even before it is itself. It is the voice of a radio two cars back and a voice in my grandmother\u2019s kitchen and a voice at the market that knows what it is selling and a voice under the water that wants me to put my face in.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sneak up on a witch,\u201d I say, and my breath ghosts the word. It\u2019s a stupid thing to say. It\u2019s a thing someone would say when they want to sound like they own something. The coins on the sand shift like fish.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she says, and she smells like caves and picnics, sweet rot that makes your knees useful. \u201cI just arrived at the same time you remembered I was coming.\u201d Mireya stands next to me like that\u2019s where she has always stood. She doesn\u2019t touch me. She has two rings on her right hand and they look very dull in this light. \u201cCareful,\u201d she says, as if the shore is a knife. \u201cYou will fall off the world if you think it stops.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what I am doing,\u201d I say, because I always do until I don\u2019t. She hums.\n\n\u201cThe world will let you save it if it can make use of the story that grows after,\u201d she says. \u201cBe sure you like stories. People will tell yours wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you here to sell me something?\u201d I ask, and we laugh, and the gull barks at us like a puppy.\n\n\u201cNo. I am here because the water is rude tonight. I am here because I cannot not be. I am here because it is time to ask you to come with me tomorrow to a thing that is not your business and will become your business if you stand next to it too long.\u201d She says it with the careless carefulness of the kind of person who knows the cost and is willing to throw it in.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere the river used to be,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere we pretend the canyons were always small.\u201d\n\nI am not a hero. I am a girl who never learned to sleep right. I am a witch whose grandmother keeps the electric bill taped under the saints. I am a person who can hear a wave talk about itself and pretend it\u2019s me. I say yes without thinking again, because it is a habit, the easiest one. Saying yes and wanting later to read the contract twice.\n\nThe world breathes a way I do not know how to describe. The coins on the sand settle. The gull shifts one foot to the other. The pier creaks an old man sound. We stand there with our arms intact and our hearts doing their work, which is to beat and to remember too much. A train howls all the way over by the tracks. A wind goes by hot as a dryer. The night sits on us for a second like a cat that has decided we will do.\n\nAt home I forget my shoes on. I am too tired to undo my braids and fall asleep with them pulling on my scalp and dream I am being stitched to the sky. My hands lift above me and I am sure I can see the seam. I am sure I can pluck it and open the bloom. I am sure the bloom is the color of a lemon that has grown in a shade. When I wake to the sound of someone knocking at the door, there is a moment where my body is not mine. It is a borrowed thing. It is a rented room. I ask the door who it is out the side of my mouth, and it says, in Abuela\u2019s voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t answer, you are already lost.\u201d\n\nI open. There is no one there. There is the wind, bringing with it a little smell like the first slice into a wheel. There is the sound of the trolley going by, the lights making my hallway into a candy cane. There is the sheaf of paper under my doormat\u2014flyers, coupons, a note in a hand I think I should know. My heart does a crunch. I bend, pick up the note, and it says, in blue pen, in tiny script that looks like it wants to be a field but keeps being a fence: you are late.\n\nFor what. I want to ask, but I know my mouth will make the wrong shape if I try. The kitchen smells like rosemary and the ghost of something long-steeped. I open the bottom drawer and unpeel the wax paper very carefully, like skin. It isn\u2019t cheese. Not anymore. It is a little square of salt, compacted, so white that the kitchen light makes my eyes water. It is scored with hairline cracks that look like dry riverbeds. When I put my finger to the surface, thinking idiotically that I can smooth it, the tiny valley under my nail fills with a tiny hurt and I taste a very old word.\n\nI\u2019m not going to eat it, I tell myself. Then my phone says 4:11 AM like that matters, like the numbers are a code I am supposed to know. I put the salt square on the counter. I put my hand over it like a makeshift altar, like this is an alarm I can muffle. Outside, a gull laughs. Or it doesn\u2019t. My building shifts like it is remembering a different city it wanted to be. I breathe in the warmth left in the room by whatever happened before I arrived at it. I stand for so long that my calves begin to throb. I am not moving, and everything is.\n\nThe note lies on the table. The letters look like a row of teeth. The wind worries at the edge of it, lifts it, puts it down. The scent of something fermented floats to the top of the room, then the bottom, like a ghost learning to climb stairs.\n\nSleep finds me standing there. Or I find sleep like you find a coin in the sand where you knew you would, where someone must have dropped it, someone exactly like you.3\n\nMorning does the thing where it pretends it never had a night. The light is already too clean when I realize I\u2019m sitting on the kitchen floor with my back against the cabinet, my cheek pressed to the lip of the counter like I\u2019m a kid listening for a pulse. My jaw clicks when I yawn. The square of salt on the counter has pulled a halo of damp out of the air and made a wet asterisk on the wood. My phone wobbles on the edge of the sink, buzzing like a bee that got inside and can\u2019t remember how to leave. I stand so fast that my knees argue, then grab for the note, the salt, my keys, the wrong jacket, the right jacket, my bracelets, the thought of breakfast, the idea of water. The note\u2014blue pen, fence letters\u2014lives in my pocket like a square animal. I hold my breath while I wrap the salt in wax paper, because it feels like it might crack if I exhale too hard, like old ice. It hums under my palm, or maybe that\u2019s my hand pretending to be useful.\n\nAbuela knocks once and lets herself in without waiting. She takes in the kitchen like a witness, her towel in one hand, her other hand already finding something to straighten that was not crooked until she touched it. She looks at the square under my hand, then at my face, then at the note in my pocket, which she can always see because pockets are for hiding and hiding is a noise. \u201cLate,\u201d she says, and it is not a question and not an accusation, just a weather report. \u201cYou dreamt on your feet again. You drooled. Look.\u201d She wipes the counter with the corner of the towel, shows me the shine, the little snail trail of my mouth, grinning like I am a child she has just caught pretending not to have eaten the frosting.\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d I say, because the words push on my teeth and will not be kept back. \u201cNow. To the river that is not a river. Will you\u2014can you\u2014\u201d I do not finish any of the three sentences I start because finishing is an art form I never chose to practice.\n\nShe looks pleased by something she does not tell me. \u201cBring a lemon,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd money, because sometimes money is the only lemon that works. And wear shoes like you lie in. Left side foot is the one you trust. Do not say you love anyone while you stand on concrete you did not pour. The words will stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d I say, reflex and revenge and real.\n\n\u201cThen say it again on the carpet,\u201d she counters, stepping back until her heels are on the kitchen rug. \u201cThere. Now it is not borrowed. Come back before noon because I promised your Uncle Tavo you would fix his phone and he will not believe me if I say the wind took you. Eat something that has already decided to be alive. Put the salt away. Don\u2019t bring it where the river used to be. It will make the old women cranky.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt came as a present,\u201d I say, feeling defensive of a mineral, which is not new behavior for me.\n\n\u201cSo did you,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t bring you everywhere. Not to weddings. Not to court.\u201d She kisses my forehead like she\u2019s telling my skull a secret. \u201cFind your door,\u201d she adds, because she has to, because it is the piece she cannot stop herself from saying, like a rosary bead that itches if it is not touched.\n\nI leave the salt under the dish rack like a pet I am not ready to admit to. I put a lemon in my bag and the copper coin that is no longer under the sand but also is, because the sea keeps two of everything and I keep the others in stories. My car coughs and agrees to be a car. The air has that pink smell of apartments making coffee and dogs being convinced to pee. I drive with the windows down even though it makes my hair a frantic animal because I want the wind to say whatever it is going to say without having to turn the volume up. The freeway is already a collection of people having a lot of feelings out loud. A man in a white truck is eating a burrito with the kind of intensity that suggests he is making a decision bigger than the burrito. A woman does the thing where she does not look before she moves over and I do the thing where I love her anyway, eventually.\n\n\u201cWhere the river used to be\u201d turns into ten different places when you try to name it. It could be the culvert that hums behind the stadium, the concrete bed that was poured so nobody had to think about flood anymore, the flat brown slice through Mission Valley where the malls set up like they are certain of their own permanence, the estuary at the lip of Dog Beach where everything comes to an argument and leaves in a compromise. I make the choice my nose tells me to make, which is to go to the place where the water still tries to remember itself, the wide shallow place where the dogs throw themselves joyfully into each other and the river meets the ocean and they pretend they like each other even when they don\u2019t.\n\nThe parking lot is already a circus, boards and boots and men without shirts returning from some proof of their own backbone. The wind is wrong. It\u2019s east at this hour and hot against my jaw, and it tastes like someone cut a lemon with a rusty knife. My stomach does the thing where it thinks we forgot something important, like a child in a play who suddenly suspects the line is never going to come. I find Mireya by not looking for her. She is on the low seawall, sitting like she sat there before people learned to wear shoes, her dress replaced by something navy that shows her collarbone like a lyric. There\u2019s a woven basket at her feet and a young guy with a bike asking her questions he thinks are charming because he doesn\u2019t hear how they sound when they come out of his mouth. She looks at him long enough to rearrange his face in her mind, then says something that makes him laugh and take his bike\u2019s sorry chain off and walk it away instead of riding. She looks at me like she is checking her watch.\n\n\u201cYou are late,\u201d she says, soft enough that it is not a greeting and not a slap, just a small plant being watered.\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d I say, which is all the pride I can afford with the note in my pocket thrumming like a hummingbird. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me when to come. That\u2019s rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assumed you would know,\u201d she says, which is ruder, because it implies a faith in me I do not get to feel all the time. \u201cLook.\u201d She gestures at the brown river, braided with dogs and discarded tennis balls and children\u2019s knees.\n\nAt first it looks ordinary, the ordinary wrong of a made channel, a place where concrete tries to teach water a new language and water, being generous, pretends to learn it while secretly plotting a return to its first tongue. Then the wrong reveals itself like February moths in a cupboard. The river\u2019s surface is scabbed in places, thin plates of white that break and drift, not foam and not trash, a skin. A woman wading with a small dog stops and lifts the animal out with a yelp because the little dog\u2019s paws have collected an instant crust that breaks when she cradles it, like it has been dipped in a brittle sugar. The kid whose ball floated too far shrieks when he reaches for it and the water stings him. He shakes his hand like a paper cut. The river is salting its own mouth. It is doing it in delicate, quiet ways, like a deliberate person. It is not all at once. That is worse.\n\nMy tongue finds the word before my head does. \u201cBloom,\u201d I say, half to myself, and half to the part of the river that is in me and wants to be useful and knows it cannot be. \u201cNo, not bloom. That\u2019s when things multiply on purpose. This is\u2014what is this?\u201d I taste the air like bread dough. It has that warm sour creeping up it, the same smell the square in my kitchen had and didn\u2019t have. \u201cDo you smell it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a woman made of it,\u201d she says, but not with pride. \u201cThere is a salt in the air that is not from this water. There is a hand in the wrong place. The wind is carrying more than itself. Look up the valley.\u201d She points, and I see it because she wants me to: the far shimmer, the ghost of a cloud, except it\u2019s not a cloud, because it moves like it has weight. It\u2019s like when flour goes up in a kitchen in a cough and then decides it\u2019s a weather pattern.\n\nA ranger on a bike does slow circles like a gate keeper trying to find where the goats are getting through. He calls something to the woman with the dog that sounds like assurance and rules. An old man in a bucket hat shakes his head and tells his companion the river has been dying for a hundred years, that he can smell it in his knees. Two teenagers step to the very lip of the brown water and then step back like it hissed, as if it was a stove. The gulls are in committee on a light pole, discussing disaster. The committee has opinions. They always do.\n\n\u201cWhat did you bring?\u201d Mireya asks, and I hear underneath it: what will you do when I ask something you did not think to bring. I pull the lemon out like a punchline. I have never been good at pretending to be anything but what I am.\n\n\u201cYellow,\u201d she says approvingly, as if color is all she waited to see. \u201cCut it. But do not put it in the river. We are not blessing anything yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I ask, as if naming will make it smaller, or at least push it into a shape with a beginning and an end.\n\n\u201cWe are listening for the door,\u201d she says, because this is the city we live in and this is the summer we are having. \u201cAnd we are going to look at something nobody wants to look at, which is the part of the river we hid under the road because it made us nervous to hear it at night.\u201d She slides off the wall with the grace of someone who knows her ankles as if they were old pets. \u201cFollow. Don\u2019t step where I step. That is not a joke. We will both fall into the same mouth if we mirror each other.\u201d\n\nWe cut behind the bathroom building and along the back fence where the ice plant tries to pretend it\u2019s a civic solution to a problem. We walk under the shade that knows it is in a place shade doesn\u2019t last. She does not walk fast. She walks like a person measuring something in her bones. We hop a low chain like teenagers and neither of us gets caught, though my jacket wants my elbow more than I want my jacket. She takes us to the place, the mouth of the culvert, the round dark where the river turns its face away from us for a stretch. It is a concrete throat with graffiti in a script that flares like anger and hearts with initials inside that are both obvious and brave. The air coming out of the tunnel has a temperature that is not honest. It is cool like a body is cool, not like shade is cool. Something talks out of it. It uses the sound of drip, the language of bugs, the echo of tires from the road above, the distant metal of a shopping cart trying to be a boat.\n\nMireya sets her basket down and takes out nothing that makes sense for a cheese seller to carry, which is how I know I am not wrong about her. A small mirror with a crack, a twist of red thread, a little jar of something that looks like it might be honey and might be everyone\u2019s favorite lie. She puts the mirror against the curve of the opening so it looks like the tunnel has a pupil. I am not brave but I have learned how to set my feet so my fear has to wait in line. I cut the lemon and hold it like the answer to a question. Its smell is so particular that my mouth floods its own small ocean.\n\n\u201cPut that on your tongue,\u201d she instructs, and I obey, salt memory banging into acid memory like drums. \u201cNow tell me what you cannot see. Tell me the shape of the thing that wants to be seen and isn\u2019t allowed yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNarrow,\u201d I say, because I can feel it in my throat suddenly, a tightness where song gets caught. \u201cCoiled. Polite. It doesn\u2019t want to alarm us. It wants us to call it something harmless. It wants to be the name of a flower. It is tired of being a tube.\u201d The lemon makes my eyes damp and the tunnel makes my ears ache and the river under concrete says I am not as big as I thought I was and that embarrasses me.\n\n\u201cOld pipes,\u201d Mireya says, as if she is remembering a childhood specialty. \u201cOld permissions. The right of way granted to a thing that was supposed to help and instead learned to rule. The bigger ones are down in the bigger valley. But every small mouth thinks it is the mouth when it first learns the word \u2018open.\u2019 We are not here to fight with a culvert. We are here to tell it where to go to find its mother.\u201d She ties the red thread around the cracked mirror like it is getting married. \u201cHold this. If you see anything you love, do not tell it that yet. Wait until it tells you its name first.\u201d\n\nThe air shifts. I feel it on my bare knee where my jeans are ripped like I am a person with a life and not a story. The wind comes in from behind us like a guest who brings their own drink. It goes into the tunnel like it owns the place. I am aware of my scalp in a way I do not like. I am aware of my tongue. The lemon is a sun in my mouth, burning polite holes in my certainty. A sound like a coin dropping runs along the concrete and the hair on my arms fusses.\n\nThere is a woman sitting against the inner curve just inside the dark, where my eyes aren\u2019t supposed to be able to resolve detail yet. I do not jump because jumping would be rude and also because she looks like a person I have always known to be in places like this even when I have never seen her before. She is middle-aged in the way of someone who has never been allowed to keep a birthday, her hair braided with bits of ribbon that are too clean to be accidental. She is wearing a sweatshirt that says a school\u2019s name that is not from here. She has a plastic bag tied around one shoe and the other foot bare. She is smoking a cigarette that is not lit, and she is humming a song that is older than the bridge we are under. She looks at me like a mirror, like I am in her lap and she is naming me in her head.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she says, and laughter blooms all over my skin because of course she says that, of course everyone is reading the same script today and none of us got to workshop it. \u201cYou brought the wrong thing.\u201d She nods toward the lemon like it is a hat with a feather exactly an inch too long.\n\n\u201cWhat was I supposed to bring?\u201d I ask, already knowing I will argue with her answer because this is how doors and I talk to each other.\n\n\u201cA certain penny,\u201d she says, and my stomach does that awful happy turn it does when meta catches up to magic and you realize you knew and did not know at once, which is the only way I can stand to live. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad. The ocean always brings it back if you ask nice. Or if you are rude with grace. Which you are.\u201d She looks beyond me at Mireya. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t bring her here without a hat,\u201d she adds, as if we are at a church picnic.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not your business,\u201d Mireya replies, mild as a salt lick. \u201cWhat do you need, t\u00eda? Tell me with your mouth or tell me with the coin that you do not have.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhite,\u201d the woman says, and I see her then because she wants me to. Her left eye has a little milk in it. Her bottom lip is split and keeps re-breaking. Her hands are too dry. She is the kind of person who knows every place the city left a hole and stepped into each one, becoming a stopgap, becoming the story other people tell about why they need to feel safe. She holds up a small square like she is an altar yourself. It is salt. It is like mine. It is not mine. It is flecked with something I do not like to think about. \u201cThey fell,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know who dropped them. My girls won\u2019t step in the water now. Even the brave ones won\u2019t. It hurts like lemons, but old. I thought, ah, this is the thing I get to keep, you know? This is the gift from the place. But it\u2019s not. It cried. It cried all night. I had to wrap it in my T-shirt so it didn\u2019t have to hear itself.\u201d\n\nMireya puts her hand over her mouth in a gesture that is not hiding so much as translating. \u201cWhere,\u201d she says, and that word is a question I have heard Abuela ask a hundred times in a hundred kitchens. It means map and it means confession.\n\n\u201cThey used to put candles here,\u201d the woman says, pointing at a little lip of concrete that is blackened, little circles of ash like coins flattened by trains. \u201cFor their uncles and their cousins and their boys. They put pictures. They put beer. They put a teddy with one eye. I put a salt square on top of the teddy and it sang. It sang wrong. It sang like a pipe. So I took it off. It laughed at me.\u201d\n\nI kneel because I need to be nearer to her feet, to the way the dirt has climbed her ankle like a river learns a bank. \u201cI have one,\u201d I say, whisper-small, as if the tunnel is a classroom and we will be allowed to answer only if we are quiet. \u201cIn my kitchen. It came as something else. It changed after and it wrote me a letter.\u201d\n\nThe woman grins like I gave her a tooth. \u201cYou got a letter? They don\u2019t usually write. What did it say? \u2018You\u2019re late\u2019?\u201d Her grin turns into a cough that bends her in half like a priest. I put my hand out and she does not take it, not because she doesn\u2019t want help but because she has a rule about not taking help from girls she loves immediately.\n\n\u201cIt said I was late,\u201d I admit, and Mireya shakes her head with so much affection that it almost hurts in its generous hardness. She looks like someone is trying to teach her a joke in a language she learned by ear.\n\n\u201cGive me the lemon,\u201d Mireya says, and I do. She squeezes it onto the cracked mirror until a bead of juice runs across the glass like an impatient child and falls into the first inch of tunnel. The drop sizzles. It actually makes that sound. It smells like a pizzeria inside a church. She listens to the sound like it is telling her a story. She turns the mirror to the side and the crack lines up with the seam where the poured concrete meets the older concrete with a plate underneath it so the whole city would not fall into itself. \u201cThere,\u201d she says, not triumphant, just sure. \u201cThe pipe. They are pushing up through the skin. Something is asking to be let through and it\u2019s too salty to be here. They tunneled the desert to our kitchen. Someone built a straw across time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDesal,\u201d I say, and the word feels ridiculous and exact at once. \u201cDesalination. The plant at Carlsbad, the big one. They pull salt out and make sweet water and then they throw the brine back to the ocean like it is a relative we don\u2019t like, and the current takes that and sweeps it south and sometimes the wind is wrong and sometimes they are wrong and sometimes the river wants to say a thing back.\u201d\n\nMireya looks at me with a mouth that is on the verge of something. \u201cAnd sometimes somebody takes the wrong pipe and puts it into the wrong mouth because paperwork is magic too, mija. We could follow permits like breadcrumbs and still arrive at a wolf. Or we can tell it, not here. Not today.\u201d She kneels and puts her hand to the concrete like a doctor lays a palm on a chest. \u201cThis is the door. This is one of them. Can you hear her, se\u00f1orita? With the ribbons. Ask your girls to sing for me. Just that one song that is brown and ugly and somebody\u2019s grandmother danced to it and no one will admit it.\u201d\n\nThe woman nods and hums. It is not the same song as before. It is more tired and more cheerful and that combination always makes me want to cry immediately, like a thrift store. The sound finds the seam. The seam hears it like a dog hears its name. The mirror fogs over. The lemon squeezes itself further into the crack because it wants to be inside something for once. I feel the hair on my neck move with the wind that isn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d the woman says, opening her eyes on me finally like she is introducing herself properly by asking me instead to be a person. \u201cYou smell like something that left and didn\u2019t leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Sol,\u201d I say, which is close to the truth most days, and I can hear Abuela correcting me, and I can hear my mother saying my middle name like a song, and I can hear the tide lying through its teeth. \u201cMy grandmother says I am thresholds. And this is Mireya. She is rot. In the good way,\u201d I add, and the woman laughs so hard on a breath that it turns to coughing again and we all wait for the cough to finish because it is part of the ritual.\n\n\u201cDoors,\u201d Mireya says when we are quiet. \u201cIf you open, it will walk. If it walks, it will tell the others. If it tells the others, they will try too. If they try, they will fail in different places. We will be busy for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let it walk here if it wants,\u201d the woman says, and she is not unkind. \u201cThis is the place that always gets everyone\u2019s footsteps anyway. It\u2019s already bruised. Give it to me. Give it to the girls. We will teach it to dance wrong so it forgets what it came for.\u201d\n\nI do not know if the world can hear that. I do know that the concrete under my knee hums like a grandmother trying not to laugh. I do know that the lemon smell is suddenly both delicious and unbearable. I do know that I can feel the coin under the water like an eye closing and opening. I take the mirror and hold it like I was told, the crack lined with the seam. I say nothing I love out loud. I wait.\n\nThe wind turns around mid-step like a person who remembers they left the stove on. It goes out instead of in. The tunnel breathes. Something gives that was pretending not to be held. The sound is small. It is the click of an old light switch. It is a knuckle being cracked discreetly in church. The skin of white on the river surface trembles and begins to move, little plates unceremoniously breaking and drifting toward the mouth where the dogs are deciding to bark at it or ignore it depending on their breed. The boy with the ball yells \u201cSick!\u201d like it is a compliment. The ranger stops circling. The gulls discuss the change in management. The woman leans her head back against the curve and closes her eyes like the tunnel just pressed a cool spoon to her brow.\n\n\u201cDo not throw away a cow\u2019s work,\u201d Mireya says under her breath, and I fight the urge to say I told you, as if I told anyone anything. She pulls a small jar of something dark from her basket and places it by the blackened lip where the candles used to be. She unscrews it and the smell that comes out is honey, yes, but also dead flowers and beer and the sticky edge of love. \u201cFor the girls,\u201d she adds, and the woman makes a face like she will not cry today if it kills us.\n\nWe sit on the low wall when we are done being in the mouth and pretend for a minute that we are pair of normal women with nothing to do but eat fruit and make jokes about joggers. Mireya breaks the rest of the lemon with her hands and smears it on her wrist, breathing there like the answer lives in her veins. I think about the salt square on my kitchen counter and whether it will have become something else by the time I get home, whether it will have written another note in a hand I can almost remember. I think about the gull with the nicked wing, whether birds hold grudges. I think about organs, how they never stop and then they stop, how the city is an organ we keep trying to pretend is in our own body.\n\n\u201cIt will happen again,\u201d Mireya says, not warning, not gloating. She rubs the pith into the pad of her thumb like a worry stone. \u201cThe pipe is not the thing. The thing is the permission. The piece of paper that says Yes, in all caps. The men who hold that paper are asleep in a way that makes them dangerous. We need to wake them or we need to move the bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we?\u201d I ask, because sometimes questions are a way to buy time in a store where time is too expensive.\n\nShe tilts her head. Her hair catches the light and throws it away again. \u201cYou are the one with a grandmother who knows the names of small doors. You tell me. Do we wake them or do we move the bed?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to say both,\u201d I admit. \u201cI want to say, yes. I want to say I can do this without breaking anything I can\u2019t fix. I want to say I am not the Tower. I want to be something that looks nothing like the Tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very beautiful when you are deciding something that is going to hurt,\u201d she says, which is both an insult and a magic trick. \u201cAsk your Abuela how to say no to the thing that wants to be saved. It is harder. It is my least favorite part of the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your job?\u201d I ask, because I am beyond not asking that particular question any longer.\n\nShe shrugs one shoulder, as if she is trying on one version of herself and finding the sleeve too long. \u201cI help things rot the way they were meant to. I make sure the wind doesn\u2019t take something that promised to stay. I kiss the milk and the milk decides to live another life. I ask bees not to tell me secrets I am not ready to keep. I tell women like you what time it is and then I sit across from them while they decide to break their clocks.\u201d She picks up a little square of the river\u2019s shed skin with the edge of the mirror and doesn\u2019t touch it. \u201cAnd sometimes I go to the market and let rich people be brave in the small way of putting something rude on their tongues. Everybody eats,\u201d she adds, looking at me like I said that first.\n\n\u201cJude will make a song out of that if you give him a pen,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd if you say my face is beautiful again when I am about to do something stupid, he will steal you and tell you all his worst ideas. I won\u2019t save you from that. He is my favorite bully.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not need saving,\u201d she says, and she smiles at me without teeth. \u201cBut I do like to be told no. Practicing consent is a game we can make holy.\u201d She stands, smooths her dress, re-ties the basket handle like it matters how it rests on her palm. \u201cCome to my table at the market Saturday. Bring your coin if the ocean gives it back. Bring the salt if you have lost the coin. If you bring neither, bring your mouth. I will give you something that will remind you of the desert and of your mother. You will hate me a little. That will be useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate easily,\u201d I say, and she lifts an eyebrow in the exact way a door does when it is not sure yet if it will open.\n\n\u201cEveryone hates easily,\u201d she contradicts gently. \u201cWe are just very good at not telling the truth about it. That is all. Tell Jude I said he has very good wrists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will be the end of me,\u201d I say, because if Jude\u2019s wrists enter the chat we will be here all day. She breaks into laughter that sounds like a spoon clinking against glass and I love her suddenly for a full second enough to be frightened by it. My mother loved like that, all at once, and looked at the mess after like it was a mural she had commissioned without seeing the sketch.\n\nWe part like a tide parting from a shore that is not done with her. I stand and watch the river behave for a few breaths like a child trying to impress a teacher. The woman in the tunnel hums still, or maybe the tunnel hums and I have given it the credit. I text Jude because I need to hear his ridiculous keyboard clicks, and he writes back immediately like his phone is a lizard he wears around his neck. He says, bring me a story. He says, bring me your face. He says, I am learning to frost a cake that does not want to be frosted. He sends a picture of his hands covered in sugar like he murdered a snowman. He is the thing I bring to everything because he is always a door in the other direction.\n\nBack at La Sirena Luminosa, Abuela has rearranged the candle shelf in a way that looks random if you are new and like a chant if you are not. She does not look up when I come in, which is how she says I have not died. She continues to wind string around the fat belly of a jar like she is swaddling something that keeps trying to be born.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d I tell her, but I am smiling because I want her to say it and then I can argue with her like a child and feel for two minutes like the world is nothing but light and chores.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she says dutifully, and I present my hands for inspection because I am a person who still wants to be graded on a curve. She turns them over, sniffing the lemon in my skin and the tunnel on my knuckles. She presses my thumb until the print shows blood a little. She nods. \u201cGood. You didn\u2019t put your love on the concrete. I can hear the lemon laughing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe river is salting up,\u201d I report, sliding the mirror onto the counter because there is nowhere else for it to be right now, because my pockets have become places I do not trust with glass and old songs. \u201cThe wind carried it wrong. Or right. Or both, if you ask someone who likes to watch small things suffer. We told it where to go. It went a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will come back a lot,\u201d she says, as if I did not expect that. \u201cSalt is the part of the story that writes itself. Did Mireya kiss anything that does not belong to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe kissed her wrist,\u201d I say, which is partly mischief and partly trying to share the awe. \u201cShe is a door that thinks it\u2019s a window, Abuela. She makes me want to pull my own head off and look inside just to see how I\u2019m built.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is sex,\u201d Abuela says dryly, and I choke on a piece of air because she is not wrong and she will be merciless about it if I tell her she is right. \u201cBe careful. Mold does not belong to anyone. It will send a letter to the person who thinks they own it and sign it with a drawing of a goat. You will have to frame it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe says everyone hates easily,\u201d I tell her, hanging my jacket on the hook where my jacket always falls off because this is how my life reminds me to pay attention in increments. \u201cShe says I\u2019m beautiful when I am deciding to be hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d Abuela says, not even glancing up, and I try to pretend that is not a knife but I can feel its edge. \u201cHelp me with this string. Your Uncle will be obnoxious about the phone and then he will make us soup that is too salty and then we will fight and then we will kiss his head and tell him to go. The woman with the lip will come back and she will want a different oil with a snake on it. The world is going to tip and we will keep sweeping during the tipping because that is what we do. Don\u2019t bring that salt into my bedroom. It will make the saints snore.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wrote me a letter,\u201d I say again, because some things I have to say twice to believe they became sentences and not dreams. \u201cIt will write another. I can feel it deciding how to spell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cIf a thing writes you, you can write back.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon is the color of a nap we will not get to take. People come in with their needs folded into their wallets, into their palms, into the flares of anger around their mouths. I make bundles with my left hand because habits are promises and promises are magic and we are doing tiny magic while the big magic adjusts its skirt and sits down hard somewhere nobody expected. I keep finding salt on my clothes where salt should not be. In the bathroom mirror, my face looks like it is about to say something I am not sure I want to hear. My phone pings with an unknown number that I do not answer because I am brave in exactly this one way.\n\nAfter closing, Jude swings in like he was caught in a net that he was excited to be caught in. He smells like burnt sugar and the rain that forgot to happen. He leans over the counter and bites my forearm because he is a feral child from a nice family and I love him. He says, tell me. I tell him. He says, oh. He says, oh. He says, I had a dream where I was a jar and someone kept putting different things in me and forgetting what they were and I think I woke up as a refrigerator. He says, I like the lady who is a salad. He says, does she have a brother? He says, do not look at me like that or I will steal your grandmother and make her my husband.\n\n\u201cYou are not allowed to marry Abuela,\u201d I say, correcting him because petty is a language we learned together. \u201cAnd if you try, the saints will come off the wall and put you in an old jar forever. You will have a label but no expiration date.\u201d\n\n\u201cSexy,\u201d he says, reading his own heartbeat like a gossip column. \u201cSo Saturday, yes? We go to her table and pretend not to be poor. We will wear hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will wear hats,\u201d I agree, and the word hat feels like an amulet that got cheap in the wash and still works a little. \u201cBring your wrists. She will give them a compliment.\u201d\n\nHe looks at his wrists like he just owned them. \u201cThey have been waiting for validation from mold. Honestly, haven\u2019t we all?\u201d\n\nNight comes back around with its pockets full of change. The pier is a sentence waiting for its verb. The wind pretends it has always come from this direction. I take the salt square out of its wax again when I get home and hold it in my palm like a small animal that would like to be a stone. It has made a little damp around itself on the dish towel. It is scored more deeply than it was before, like a map remembering its river. I bring it to my nose like a fool and of course it makes my mouth flood, of course it makes me think of every bad kiss I ever had and all the good ones I did not have yet. On the table, the note lies under the pepper grinder. It has bled a little where the blue pen met a drop of water. \u201cyou are late,\u201d it says, and then in tiny script on the back that my eye skipped until it did not: \u201cwe waited anyway.\u201d\n\nI am not crying when I lie down. I refuse. My eyelids dampen on their own like the city dew. My dreams are not water this time. They are brick and line and gate and a list of words that all mean door in a language I have to learn by sleeping. When I wake at 3:03, for no reason, with my hands above my head like I\u2019ve been surrendering in a more fun place, the apartment smells like lemon and like something that learned to be itself without my permission. The trolley goes by and the whole building wants to hum along. My mother\u2019s jacket hangs on the closet door like a person. I say her name into the pillow because the pillow will not judge my accent. The wind lays its weight on the window and then rolls off, satisfied.\n\nOn Saturday, we will go to the market with hats and wrists and smell the bees thinking. Today, the city holds her breath and lets it go and holds it again. Somewhere, a pipe shifts in its sleep. Somewhere, a gull steals a coin. Somewhere, a girl drops a candle in the wrong place and finds herself loved anyway. The river remembers, just a little. The lemons on my counter turn their faces to the window. The square in my kitchen listens, and when I touch it, it is not cold anymore. It is the temperature of a hand. It is a letter that has added a line. It says, if you open, walk. It says, if you close, sing. It says, we will use your name when we have to and not before. It says, try to be on time.Saturday pretends to be casual and fails. The light is loud already when I open my eyes and the salt square on the counter has made a ring like a wedding on the wood, a perfect pale halo that makes me feel guilty for having dropped oil near it ever in my life. The note under the pepper has bled itself into legibility, party trick, and added a line that looks like a mouth in profile. I brush my teeth and it tastes like I have been eating ocean air. Abuela is humming in the living room, an old song that makes the carpet look like it might decide to be a field. She holds up two hats when I come out, one with a brim like a plate you could serve oranges on and one with a bruise at the crown where somebody once loved it hard.\n\n\u201cWear the ugly one,\u201d she says, not even pretending I get a choice. \u201cSomeone will give you a compliment because they think you need one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very direct,\u201d I say, putting on the hat that looks like it has a history and letting it sit too far back on my head because I always forget that hats have laws. \u201cThe salt wrote again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will,\u201d she says, as if I told her the dryer finished its cycle. \u201cDo not bring it. If it misses you, it will find your wrist. Eat something that has a grandmother. No smoothies.\u201d\n\nI eat an egg that likes me back and a piece of bread that Abuela toasts in a pan like a person who never learned to trust appliances. The phone buzzes with Jude telling me he is bringing a hat that is technically a costume and that he will be late on purpose so we can arrive like a pair of people who do not care. I put a lemon in my bag and a handful of quarters because nothing good ever came of pretending you couldn\u2019t buy parking if you needed to. The coin that is not mine yet not gone is a weight in my hope, a bruise I poke with my tongue. The mirror goes into the bag too, wrapped in the red scarf I stole from Lina the year we decided to be women with scarves and failed by Thursday.\n\nJude is already on the curb outside my building, obviously early, wearing something that looks like he raided a costume shop for a gardener who is also a well-paid witch. The hat is a floppy green thing that sits on his skull like a pet. His wrists are on purpose. He twirls when he sees me because he is a weather vane for approval.\n\n\u201cWrists?\u201d he asks, thrusting his arms out like offerings.\n\n\u201cExquisite. The mold will propose,\u201d I say, and he clutches his throat like a maiden and slips into the passenger seat with a noise that is either a sigh or the hot coffee stabbing him in the thigh through the paper cup.\n\nLittle Italy pretends it is a village and does a good job for the first hour of the market, when the white tents are still crisp and the wind has not yet decided to flirt with anything expensive. Salvador waves a peach at me like it\u2019s a warning and I buy two because his eyes are irresistible in their pitying disdain. The air is already making a decision about direction; it comes from the east and then the west in one breath, doors misaligning, and you can feel people\u2019s hair arguing with itself in their shadows. Jude is already coveting a cake he will regret smelling.\n\nMireya\u2019s table is a map made of wedges. She has the yellow dress again but it has a denim apron over it with flour ground into the seam, and her hair is an argument with her hat that the hat is losing. Bees orbit in a wide calm ring that reads as planned to anyone who hasn\u2019t had them baptize their scalp. A sign hangs from the canopy with the goat drawing she mentioned, and the font on BASTA! CHEESE is somehow both angry and charming in a way that makes you open your wallet faster because you feel flattered by your own cheekbones. She does not look up when we arrive, which means she sees us without eyes.\n\n\u201cWrists,\u201d she says, and Jude preens like a cat accepting praise from a statue. \u201cLet me see. Mmm. These are bread-cutter wrists. Useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot say that to him,\u201d I scold, but I am laughing because he has framed his hands in the air like a museum hang.\n\n\u201cI brought my mouth,\u201d I say, offering it like a sacrament. \u201cThe river behaved in public. The tunnel is a door that we told to go into a different hallway.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will find another hallway,\u201d she says, not put out. \u201cPaper beats salt sometimes. It\u2019s very rude.\u201d She lifts a wedge with the knife, sets it on the paper like she is setting down a slug and a gem at once. \u201cTaste. This one is desert window. It has the wind in it from a place where wind gets around with nobody telling it which way to point.\u201d\n\nThe cheese does something to me that is embarrassing to admit in a crowd. It is dry and oily and there is a bright on the back of my tongue like the sudden memory of a word I learned as a child and haven\u2019t had to speak since. It tastes like a lot of things I have never tasted\u2014dust that has been kind, mesquite shadow, goat laughter, a hint of something metallic like the inside of a balloon\u2014and it tastes like my mother putting on her jacket in the kitchen while she eats the last bite of toast over the sink because she will eat properly later, she swears. Jude\u2019s eyes go huge because he is watching my face like a movie he wants to narrate.\n\n\u201cYour mother?\u201d he says softly like he has put his finger into a song and felt the edge.\n\n\u201cShe smoked cigarettes in the doorway,\u201d I say, the fact rising up like a fish. \u201cShe told me to practice doing nothing with purpose. She said otherwise everything would slide together and I would have no handholds. She could peel an orange without breaking the peel. She never saved a bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Mireya says, and the ah is not pity and not interest and simply room. \u201cGood. Your mouth remembers. This will help you be impolite to the right people.\u201d\n\nA booth three tents down is a little universe that looks like it hates us. There is a backdrop with a photo of the ocean turned into a smiling faucet. A banner reads COUNTY WATER SOLUTIONS in a font that is polite the way a door that has been oiled is polite. A woman with a polo shirt and a tiny microphone kisses the air with her hand gestures as she says the words Community Stewardship and Environmental Compliance and Tours Available. The table has a fishbowl full of pens and a stack of flyers with a cartoon droplet wearing sunglasses. You can smell toner and the ghost of electrical fires. Paper is a spell; you can see the edges of it like heat waves, how it quivers around them. A man with a clipboard and a posture like he has never run unless chased points out a diagram to a grandfather who nods like he is listening but is actually hearing the tambor in his blood because there is a band tuning up by the fountain.\n\n\u201cThey set up here every third Saturday,\u201d the woman to the left of us says, sotto voce in the way of someone who loves gossip and hates conflict. She sells candles shaped like animals that look slightly melted and extremely loved. \u201cThey give out those drops and tell you to plant natives and then last year my neighbor got a notice that he was using too much water washing his truck and I thought he was going to die of shame on the spot.\u201d\n\nMireya rolls her shoulders back like she is making a square for something heavy to sit on. \u201cGo listen,\u201d she murmurs to me. \u201cDon\u2019t speak. Not yet. If you speak too soon, paper will make you promise something you can\u2019t keep.\u201d\n\nJude has already wandered over with the bright idiot fearlessness that has gotten him out of more trouble than it gets him into. He collects a sticker for me that says I HEART RESPONSIBLE REHYDRATION and three pens that probably dry up before we get to the car. The woman with the mic smiles at me like she is tired of smiling and too well-trained to stop. Her hair is the exact color of a fence made new. Her nametag says KRISTIN with a K that strains to be formal and begs to be liked.\n\n\u201cHave you heard about our ocean-to-glass initiative?\u201d she asks, and I do not say, yes, I had it in my mouth last night and it tasted like a question we should have asked thirty years ago. I take the flyer. The paper hums like a refrigerator, very faint, just enough to call insects and people who like to fill out surveys.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to the salt?\u201d I ask, because not speaking is not an art I practice well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s returned,\u201d she says, and she says it like a lullaby. \u201cReturn is the most natural thing in the world. We return. The sea returns. It\u2019s a circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes circles are cages,\u201d Jude says cheerfully, because he has never been able to stop himself from bending language back on the person who made it. \u201cSometimes returning is just called not leaving.\u201d\n\nKristin\u2019s smile clicks an inch tighter. She does not flinch. She taps a laminated photo of the plant where it looks like a very clean hospital that happens to be married to a very enthusiastic pipe. \u201cWe disperse at a rate that meets and exceeds state standards,\u201d she says, and you can hear her audit feel proud. \u201cThe brine comes out perfect. It gets mixed before it can become a problem. We are committed.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what?\u201d I ask, and her eyes do a thing like a coin rolling and then lying flat.\n\n\u201cTo working with community members,\u201d she says finally, which is very nearly a sentence. \u201cWe have tours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like tours,\u201d Jude says, inventing himself as a person who likes tours because the idea of infiltrating anything in a legal way gives him sugar highs. \u201cDo we get to see the pipe? Do we get to taste anything? Do we get to ask the pipe about its feelings?\u201d\n\nKristin laughs as if he has made the same joke she has heard twelve times and still wants to like. \u201cWe have safety guidelines.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaper,\u201d whispers Mireya behind me, the word both warning and caress. She is holding a jar of honey near her shoulder and the bees have begun to lightly test the air around it like a necklace. I can feel a shift in the light like a cloud snuck into the market without paying. When I glance down the aisle, I see spilled salt, except it is not spilled, it is falling, soft, a faint sift of white that makes people squint and look up like they will catch a flake on their tongue. It is so slight that your brain wants to call it dust because dust is the polite way to name the odd things the world does when you are not watching.\n\nThe first bee that hits my cheek does not sting. It lands and lifts and lands like it is unsure of the floor. The second one is drunk with the wrong air. Mireya\u2019s shoulders change shape. The jar disappears into the basket so the nectar is not a song in the wrong room. The bees get confused but not mean. They rise higher, their circle tilting, a soft felony in the air. People tug hats, laugh in the tense way that means a story later if it goes right, a siren if it goes wrong.\n\n\u201cSugar,\u201d Jude says, like a prayer and like a curse at once, and then his body finds its place the way his body always does around spills. He pulls his squeeze bottle from his satchel because there is always a squeeze bottle in his satchel and mists a veil around us. The air catches it and brings it back down a few inches away, and the bees do exactly what they do when you distract them with work\u2014they slow, momentarily befriended by the task of cleaning their sisters, tongues out like secrets, feet moving on their faces like handkerchiefs. Mireya\u2019s voice is small and specific, humming a shape in her throat that lets the bees put their heads on it.\n\nThe drift of white is not ash. It is salt, so fine that my lips taste it and my eyes water without my consent. It catches in the corners of signs and lies along the edge of the tent like the sign of a church that forgot itself on a weekday. People begin to say the word weird in voices that want to be brave. Kristin\u2019s mic picks up the catch in her breath and broadcasts it. I want to put my hands on the legs of the canopy because I suddenly love the idea of a roof with a purpose so hard it makes my fingernails hurt. The salt makes patterns on the pavement where coffee spilled earlier and I see the river in the city where there is not one, little tributaries of this unwanted weather.\n\n\u201cSing,\u201d the note at home says to the part of me that is willing to take instruction like a wild plant. Open, walk. Close, sing. If I open here, everything walks, and not all of it knows where it is going. If I close, somebody will call me selfish. I put my mouth to the idea of a song and my throat refuses to be pretty. Mireya hears that and smiles with her eyes.\n\n\u201cUgly,\u201d she says, approving, and I find the tune that lives in the kitchen when the pot refuses to boil. It is the song with no words that Abuela uses to tell the rice to stay soft even though she took her eye off it for a minute to yell at the radio. Jude catches it in his mouth like a penny and hums too, a lower line, his chest against the table, his wrists finally doing their holy work of being hinge and hinge and hinge. The bees respond by becoming heavy around the honey they cannot see. They gather into an idea and the idea becomes a little living ornament on the edge of a sign that says CASH OR CARD. It is beautiful in the way a problem is beautiful when it becomes visible.\n\nSomeone laughs like a collapse and a tent down the row does the Tower\u2019s trick. The pole doesn\u2019t split and its canopy doesn\u2019t fling itself dramatically into traffic, which would at least be theatrical. It just sighs, a simple failure of attention, and the whole white expanse slumps and then leans and then lays itself over a table of soaps and jams in an exhausted attempt at being shade. There is the collective intake of breath that a crowd does when it loves a little catastrophe. Nothing is broken because the jars had that luck you can\u2019t pay for. A woman comes out from under the tent like a bride who changed her mind and thinks she can get away with it if she doesn\u2019t make eye contact. The salt settles. The bees knit themselves into a quieter ruffle.\n\nKristin has not moved. Her mic has dutifully stayed on through everything and now when she clears her throat, we all hear it, the sound of a woman who has been told she has to start again at the part where she reassures us. She looks at me, which is a mistake, and then she looks at Mireya, which is a bigger mistake, and you can see the paper magic around her make a fist and then uncurl because it has been seen. Her voice wavers and then steadies. She asks if we have any questions. I tell myself not to ask one with teeth.\n\n\u201cHow far does your return go?\u201d I ask anyway, and the question is a coin that has been in my mouth too long. \u201cHow far, in miles, in hours, in wind? How far in fashion? How far does it go before it becomes something you pretend never started with you? You say, out at the outfall, it mixes. What happens when the wind is wrong? What do you call that?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnomaly,\u201d she says, and someone near us laughs in the rude way that means dissent. \u201cWe call it an anomaly. Our monitoring at the site shows\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot your site,\u201d Mireya says with the gentleness of something about to grow teeth. \u201cThis site. Your site isn\u2019t the ocean. It\u2019s your site.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in compliance,\u201d Kristin says, and I think about the wind trying to find out who that is, compliance, and bringing back handfuls of her hair to lay on her doorstep. She leaves us with a promise to put us on a list. She writes my name hard enough that the pen almost breaks. Jude wants to put a sticker on her shirt that says we waited anyway and lives for the rest of the hour in the place in his mind where he is both a saint and a problem.\n\nWhen it\u2019s over, the salt scum along the tent edges looks like the edge of a bath nobody has drained yet. Mireya takes a dish of water from the woman with the candles and washes the little cluster of bees gently off the sign, her fingers like weather around them, and they shiver into themselves and rise, nothing injured by accident except our pride. I rub my wrists with rosemary out of habit and because it feels like a sentence I forgot to finish. A gull lands on the canopy and slaps it with his feet like a cheap drum. It is the gull with the nicked wing. He looks at me like he drew me and wants notes. He drops something onto the tablecloth and hops two steps sideways like a magician revealing a dove, and there it is, the coin, the exact coin or its perfect cousin, copper corrected by the sea, the face a scratch of a man with a laurel that could be a fish if you squint. The salt has crusted one edge into a ridged line. My stomach kicks like I drank water too fast.\n\n\u201cRude,\u201d Jude says in deep admiration of the bird, and I put my hand above the coin and then down because I am not going to play coy with a gull. It is cold and I am not. It feels like a yes I didn\u2019t deserve.\n\n\u201cDo not say I love you on the asphalt,\u201d Abuela\u2019s voice says in my ear, and I swallow the words like a bitter. I look at Mireya because I cannot not, because gratitude is a hand that wants to put itself somewhere, and her face is a little hungry for me in a way that embarrasses us both, and on the other side of my embarrassment is something like joy.\n\n\u201cBring it to the plant,\u201d she says, too quickly to be casual. \u201cBring the coin. We will go on the tour. We will be good and we will not bite anyone until the part where biting is invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d Jude reads off the flyer because he is nosy at an Olympian level. \u201cTen and two. We can skip work if we call it education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a model employee,\u201d I lie, and then when the woman with the soaps hugs her soap back into standing, I help right the arm of the tent with the movement you learn from making beds that never stay made. People look at each other dead in the face like weather conspirators for a minute, and then the market returns to its ordinary ritual of feeding strangers.\n\nMireya hands me a wedge wrapped in paper that says in a handwriting I recognize from my own skin, for your grandmother\u2019s mouth. The bees are quiet now and one hunts my hat brim like it wants to sign it. We sit on the curb with our hats throwing silly shapes on the asphalt and lick sugar from a paper boat because Jude cannot walk away from a churro vendor like a decent liar. A child straps himself into a stroller like he is the bus driver to the day and the wind sits down for a smoke behind the post office.\n\n\u201cWhat did the note say this morning?\u201d Jude asks around cinnamon and grease.\n\n\u201cIt said I was late,\u201d I say, looking at the coin against my knee in the light, loving it like a person I should not kiss. \u201cAnd then it said, we waited anyway. And then it said, if you open, walk. If you close, sing. Which is useful but also like being told to be water and fire and to bring snacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do two things,\u201d Jude says, and he says it like he is willing to do four if I ask. \u201cYou have a stupid large mouth. It\u2019s a miracle anything stays inside. It\u2019s my favorite thing about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe plant,\u201d I say, because it helps to say it out loud, because paper magic hates being acknowledged by anyone but the people who wrote it. \u201cWe will walk in like we came to learn and we will learn and we will close our mouths until it is time, and then we will push on the part where the door sticks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will wear my nice shirt,\u201d he vows, and Mireya snorts, the sound like the exact second a rind cracks under a knife. \u201cShe will wear her wrists. You will wear your nose. We will not look at anyone with love on concrete. We will lie with our eyes and tell the truth with our breath. We will bring lemon. We will not bring salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not bring salt,\u201d Mireya repeats, and she is not smiling now. \u201cThey will notice it. They have dogs for it. Or paper dogs. Same difference.\u201d\n\nWhen I get back to the shop with my hat doing crimes on my head, Abuela is telling a woman about the way smoke gets into fabric and slowly undoes the part of you that pretends it isn\u2019t hungry. She kisses the wedge through the paper like a saint\u2019s toe bone and puts it on the shelf behind the register like it is a relic. She doesn\u2019t ask about my coin but her eyes flicker to my pocket as if all pockets are transparent to grandmothers, a natural law they don\u2019t brag about because why bother. We sit on the floor for a minute while nobody comes in, the kind of minute that makes you remember your knees have feelings.\n\n\u201cI sang in public,\u201d I confess, as if I put a spoon in a socket.\n\n\u201cYou will sing in a worse place soon,\u201d she says, satisfied. \u201cYou will be so embarrassed you will think you are dying and then nobody will die and you will be mad you lived with that hair and that shirt on. And then you will be proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about paper?\u201d I ask, thinking of Kristin\u2019s voice and how tired it was under her training. \u201cNot books. Paper that grows like a weed. Paper that wants to make a house out of a lie.\u201d\n\nShe laughs, mean and full of love. \u201cI know everything in this city was built on a piece of paper and that none of it asked the ground permission. I know the man who married your mother and father forgot to sign the right page and so they fought for ten years like ghosts because the paper would not let them stop being together in the only way that counted there. I know permits are like lemonade. They make everything look sweet and then you put your tongue in and it turns your face into a new thing. I know you can write a thing back. You need a better pen. The blue one is for coupons. Bring a black one to the tour. Make your letters look like a fence.\u201d\n\nAt home, the salt has done another trick. It sits where I left it and looks exactly the same if you are a stranger, but when I lift it, the bottom has printed itself onto the countertop in a fine echo of lines that are not cracks but rivers. A child would call it a map without knowing it is a map. The lines are uneven, deliberate, the way a hand draws the same thing ten times until it remembers itself. The note on the table has more ink now because I cannot leave anything alone. It says, if you are open, walk. If you are closed, sing. Underneath, in the new tiny script that seems to arrive when the day has been rude, it says, you are not a tower if you kneel.\n\nI kneel because it tells me to and because I am tired of being the only thing standing when the light goes wrong. The coin is warm in my palm, copper taking my heat like a rumor. The gull with the nicked wing will live as long as gulls live, eternity tied to a parking lot. The plant will open its doors because paper demands it. We will wear our hats like amulets and Jude will compliment a pipe and Mireya will smell like the inside of a cave that keeps secrets like seeds. Abuela will send me with a black pen and a towel. I will forget the towel and she will laugh and the brine will sigh at my ankles and salt will make my mouth honest even when the rest of me is dressed for company. The world will be rude. We will be ruder. We will be on time.Tuesday pretends to be reasonable by starting with marine layer, that eggshell gray that sits on the city like a napkin, as if the sky doesn\u2019t want us to make a mess. The salt square on my counter has made itself at home, nested in its own damp ring, but it has the patience of an aunt today and doesn\u2019t write. The coin is in my pocket, copper against denim, a temperature that feels like a small animal deciding whether to trust me. Abuela makes me drink a glass of water with lemon and a little honey, which she does when she wants my mouth to be sweeter than my plans. She hands me the black pen, the one that makes fences, and a towel that is older than all my good intentions, softened by so many kitchens that it knows how to behave without being told. She looks at me over her glasses like she will not say a word about miracles and will count the forks when I get back.\n\n\u201cDo not sign anything you do not read out loud in your heart,\u201d she says, knotting her hair with one hand and the day with the other. \u201cIf you want to set a trap, do it where there are already mice. Paper has mice.\u201d She taps the pen into my palm three times and then again under my wrist like a priest pushing oil into skin. \u201cIf you feel a door open and you are not ready to walk, sing and make it close like a shy thing. Do not be the Tower in your shoes. Be a woman who knows where the windows are.\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u00ed,\u201d I promise, and she watches the word come out of my mouth like a smoke she is evaluating for heat. Jude texts me a picture of the green hat from Saturday upside down on his head like a turtle shell and I tell him to stop and also that we leave three minutes early because if we miss the turnoff I will never hear the end of it from the part of my brain that runs her own radio show where the host\u2019s voice is my mother\u2019s.\n\nWe drive north on the 5, the freeway already a necklace of unhelpful promises, the cars full of people having quiet fights with themselves about time and sandwiches and how to tell someone no. The lagoon mouths open and close along the way, Santa Margarita and Batiquitos offering up their flat brown tongues to the morning. When we pass the old smokestack near Carlsbad, it looks like a chalk finger pointing at a god the city forgot to believe in, and Jude salutes it because he is that kind of person, disrespectful and devout. The marine layer is peeling back to show a disrespectful blue that will make a lot of people brave later, in their shoes and in their emails.\n\nThe desal plant sits on the edge of a story the city tells about itself, all bleached walkway and polite fences, a shinily obvious future, the hum of water being told what to be and agreeing because rebellion is exhausting this week. There is a sign that has thought about flirting with us: Ocean-to-Glass in a font that wants to be friends with our grandchildren. A chalkboard tells us Tours: 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and the space next to it is blank like a dare. A woman with a lanyard sits behind a folding table that is made less poor by a neat cloth and a vase of suspiciously cheerful succulents. Her nametag makes her KRISTIN again, K pronounced like a consonant that\u2019s good at filling out forms. Her hair is a good citizen. Her smile is the end of a line and the beginning of a script.\n\n\u201cYou made it,\u201d she says, like she knew we would not dare be late to something this official, and then we all pretend not to hear the little echo of her voice from Saturday where she said words that were meant to sleep under pillows instead of being used in daylight. \u201cSign in here and here. We have safety glasses and visitor badges for everyone. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re interested in learning about where our water comes from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere it goes, too,\u201d Jude murmurs, and I step on his shoe because our friendship is a sport with rules and because he will laugh and forgive me and then push harder in a different place like he always does.\n\nThe waiver has all those soft eyes in its language, the kind of grammar that makes you agree before your hand remembers how to write no. It says I acknowledge. It says I understand. It says I will not hold anyone responsible if my own feet betray me. It says there will be loud noises. It says I won\u2019t take photographs of things that make someone nervous in an office far away. There is a white space for my name that is both simple and important, and I say it in my heart out loud to test it, the way you test fruit with your thumb for that sweetness under the skin. I write my name. I write my last name so slowly the pen thinks it might be a painting. The ink is very black. I make a box around a paragraph that I cannot agree to because it says I will not touch any levers and I need the option of touching something with one finger like you touch a child\u2019s shoulder in a crowd, to say, wait. The box is not big. It is a neat fence. The letters I draw with the black pen make a little fence next to the words \u201creturn\u201d and \u201ccompliance\u201d and \u201cdiffuse.\u201d I do not draw the fence around the word \u201ctour\u201d or around the word \u201ccommunity,\u201d though part of me would like to chain-link those too, to keep them from being turned into excuses.\n\nKristin doesn\u2019t flinch when I read one sentence quietly to myself. She is a woman who could sell me a ladder and make me feel like a good person for buying two. She hands me the safety glasses and they make the world look like the world, but squeakier, and I am always the person who makes jokes about goggles and then tucks them in my bag later like a gift because the future loves to surprise me about what will be useful.\n\nThere are twelve of us in this morning\u2019s group, a cheerful ratio of retired couples with water bottles like talismans, a teacher on summer break who smells like patience that has been beaten into a shape that will not break, two men who are already asking questions about cost because they make friends with numbers to avoid the other things that want to hold their hands, a teenager with hair in his eyes who keeps his hood up like the world is a bit too bright, a woman with a baby in a carrier who is rocking a rhythm that is older than concrete, and us, three people dressed like a carnival that makes its own rules. There is also a man who walks at the back with a ring of keys on his belt and a hardness around his eyes that is less about mistrust and more about being tired of being asked to pretend the same kindness to the same mistake. He might be maintenance or security or the person who knows where the good cookies are and doles them out to the chosen.\n\nWe begin in a little classroom because all rituals start that way if they are going to work on people who don\u2019t want to be taken. There is a video. It has a whale at the beginning and then a child laughing and a view of the ocean that has been made to look less like a force and more like a friend. There are simple lines that make complicated pipes look like spaghetti you could untangle if you had a mom who taught you that trick. There is a timeline that begins in drought and ends in sunshine, and there are a lot of phrases that talk to you gently about Responsibility and Innovation and Partnership. If you listen under it, if you listen where Abuela taught me to listen, there is a whisper that says, we are using bigger spoons to solve a hunger that will not quiet down. There is a whisper that says, we have built a bed in a place the river did not choose, and then we told the river to sleep there and then blamed her when she kicked. The subtitles do not say any of that, so I cross my ankles and hold my black pen like a cigarette I\u2019m not supposed to smoke anymore.\n\nThe tour takes us out onto the metal grating where you can feel the hum in your ankles, through the room where filters taller than Jude act like polite bouncers, past the row of white tubes where membranes listen to water and tell it to shape up, into the hall where you can smell a cleaned kind of chemical that isn\u2019t bleach and isn\u2019t rain but lives at the party where they invite both. There is the control room with the glass wall like an aquarium, and inside there are screens, graphs scudding across their faces, numbers like very serious versions of astrology. The operators sit with their hands near their knees in that un-alarm that means if something goes wrong, it will be smaller if they get up slowly. Kristin is good at the part where she names the thing in front of us and then names the way it used to be done and then names the better way that is happening now. She is better at making me feel in on the secrets than I want her to be, which makes me generous and suspicious at the same time. She says brine in the way of someone who has been told to say it like an afterthought and not like a noun that gets to have power.\n\nWe stop at a window that looks out toward the lagoon, and the water sits there pretending to be a painting. The old smokestack is to our left, bony and ridiculous and somehow still something I love, and the day is putting its shiny shirt on by then, that tourist blue that keeps postcards in business. A gull floats by and stares at me like he knows my hair better than I do. He has a nick in his wing. He yawns without closing his eyes because he has bad manners and better things to do.\n\nWhen we get to the part about the return, there is a diagram, and the diagram is precise like a turnstile. Pipes go out. They are bigger than my optimism and smaller than my dread, and they split like a family that never learned to share. Diffusers make bubbles into a necklace in the water where the math says they disappear. The line that shows salinity is blue and then darker blue and then normal blue, and the blue is a lie the way all drawings are lies that ask you to trust them. Kristin says \u201cwe monitor\u201d with a smile that is almost a wince, and the black pen makes my fingers itch in that place where I didn\u2019t know paper could sweat.\n\nThe paper door is not the sign-in sheet. It is not the tour waiver or the brochure that shows me a photo of a woman who looks like me holding a glass of water like a poster for good behavior. It is the binder on a shelf in the little administrative nook where the wall is covered in framed certificates. It is stamped and initialed and laminated in places where someone got very serious about their job and forgot to look up at the sky for a week. It hums the way a beehive hums when the queen is pretending to sleep. I can feel it as a pressure under my fingernails, like I need to scratch at the air to make something equal again. The man with the ring of keys stands near the binder like he knows, not magically, not entirely, but in that way of someone who has seen papers undo people and is tired of mopping.\n\n\u201cCan we?\u201d I ask Kristin, and I make the word as small as possible, pointing at the binder with the pen capped, a child asking for more bread. \u201cI like to know what the paper thinks. I won\u2019t touch. I will only watch it breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she says, because she cannot say no to a sentence made of compliment and childlike curiosity, and she hands me the book the way you hand a stranger a baby, that mix of trust and terror. The binder is heavier than I want it to be and lighter than it should be if this is what it says it is. The pages smell like heat and toner and the way a room smells when everyone left it in a hurry and came back pretending they didn\u2019t. There are signatures that look like birds and signatures that look like machines and one that looks exactly like a mouth. There are maps that refuse to be art but are anyway. There are words that make a fence around intention and then cut a gate in it that only certain people can see. There is the permit, the one that says yes to return in a paragraph that is patient and proud, and next to it there are conditions written like guidance and love, measured in numbers that make the wind look like a well-behaved dog.\n\nI take the black pen without uncapping it because I was told not to touch and I am a good liar only in moments when it matters. I hold the coin under my thumb on the plastic slipcover the way you hold a thing down that wants to lift. The coin warms and then cools in that beating way that could be my own pulse, which is cute if I\u2019m being generous and annoying if I\u2019m being me. Mireya stands close enough that I can smell caves and bless her for not pretending to be somewhere else. Jude stands far enough that he can ask a question at the right volume when I nod. The man with the keys looks at the counter as if it might misbehave.\n\n\u201cDoes your permit say what the wind has to be doing?\u201d I ask, because the pen wants a yes or a no to bite, and Kristin smiles with all her training like she can make that answer into a calendar.\n\n\u201cWe have monitoring at the site,\u201d she says, and the phrase is a sink with the stopper in it. \u201cWe meet and exceed state standards. The plume\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere does the paper say \u2018no\u2019?\u201d I interrupt, because I can be rude when a door starts to open without asking my name, and I feel the bite of that in my tongue like a lemon seed. \u201cNot that no. Not no to you. The one where the no is a gift. Where does it say, if this, stop. If east, wait. If bees can\u2019t fly straight, reconsider. If your operator breathes funny, call a grandmother.\u201d\n\nA man who is not Kristin but is near enough to the door to be an important noun appears as if conjured by the sound of his own handwriting. He has a badge with a photo from six years ago and a polo shirt that fits the way shirts fit men who got used to having people at their desks. He says he\u2019s the Compliance Director like he\u2019s meeting a neighbor in a shared driveway. He says the word outfall without apology. He says the word variance like it\u2019s a prayer. He says, \u201cOur modeling shows\u2014\u201d and I say, \u201cI know,\u201d and I don\u2019t, which is both rude and true.\n\nThe binder does not like the pen when I uncork it under my breath and make my fences on the brochure under the plastic. I draw a little box next to the paragraph that the man\u2019s finger hovers over, a box that isn\u2019t on the paper but lives beside it, and then I write in that box like a person who has a name and has decided to use it. If east wind shall exceed a mouthful, hold. If river shall put a skin on itself anywhere within the arms of this county, hold. If the gull with a nick asks with his wicked laugh, consider that a notice from the old managers. If bees cannot decide on a circle, halt until a woman with salt in her pocket says go, and if she has no salt, a lemon will do. If your operators look away when they say \u201cnormal,\u201d tell the pipe to put its head under a towel and breathe. If a grandmother prays in a language you forgot, listen.\n\nIt is ridiculous and it is everything. It is not a permit, except a permit is a letter and I am writing back with my mouth and my memory. I press the coin into the corner of the paper that is touching the plastic that is touching the paper that is touching the law, and I say my name the way Abuela taught me, the way the saints are supposed to, first and middle like a slap and a kiss. The coin doesn\u2019t spark because this isn\u2019t that kind of story, but the metal hum runs up into my wrist and down my chest like someone tuned me. The man with the keys looks up suddenly and stares at a point in the air where a fly isn\u2019t, his head tipped in that way dogs do when they hear a different frequency. Jude trips on air on purpose and asks the Compliance Director if the tours ever taste the brine, if there is a way to put the ocean back in your mouth with the math on it, and while the man is busy trying to make a laugh out of that, the screen in the control room grows a tiny flag next to one line that had been complacent for a long time. It is a square no bigger than a fingernail, effectively meaningless to a general public, a rubber plant brown that is not an alarm and not a compliment. I watch a hand in the control room reach across a console to silence something that didn\u2019t make a sound.\n\n\u201cScheduled test,\u201d Kristin says into the air in that almost-question way that means she hopes we will let her keep her job. \u201cWe do system checks. It\u2019s part of our\u2026\u201d She looks at the binder like it will admit to being a crystal ball, like it will read my fence handwriting through the plastic and punish us all with a paragraph.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, backing up like a woman who does not mind being polite and doing her breathing outside. \u201cWe didn\u2019t bring salt,\u201d I add quietly to nobody in particular, and the air in my mouth says, good girl, the way a wretched aunt in a fairy tale might say it when you bring her an impossible object wrapped in an ordinary cloth.\n\nWe finish the tour with our ears doing that thing where they tell a different story than our eyes and our mouths behave themselves. The ultraviolet room is pretty in the frightening way of anything that kills invisibles and laughs about it. The pump hall roars like a political rally, and we smile like constituents and pretend we like the sound. The outfall is a line on a laminated map, polite and accurate, and the sea outside preens in the morning like she always does when a camera points at her. There is a mural near the exit where a little girl puts a cup under a tap and the artist has given her eyelashes that suggest she is destined for the kind of trouble I make, and I refuse to take that personally.\n\nIn the parking lot, the marine layer has gone to powder and the sun is an actor who took a workshop and learned about making an entrance. I lean on the hood of my car because it is still too cool to burn me and look at the old smokestack like a landmark in a dream where all the landmarks belong to someone else. The gull with the nick in his wing floats above our hood and laughs exactly like he did at the pier, like he would have been a marvelous uncle if he weren\u2019t a thief, and drops nothing, which is also a message where I live. The plant hums like an organ tuning itself. I can see the wind from here the way I can smell rain in other people\u2019s cities; it moves in folds, it makes small holdings; it hesitates and then decides. At my hip, the black pen has leaked a dot through the wrap of its cap onto my skin, a perfect kiss of carbon that looks like infinity if infinity wasn\u2019t such a show-off.\n\n\u201cScheduled test,\u201d Jude recites, mimicking that professional calm with a little wiggle of his shoulders because he can\u2019t not, then sits on the curb like a child who would love this more if there were pigeons involved. \u201cYou fenced the paper and it made the boys press a button.\u201d He wiggles his wrists like a composer did a trick.\n\n\u201cI sang very quietly,\u201d I admit, the words reluctant but true, and I hear the salt square in my kitchen making its little noises like someone heaps sugar with a spoon in the next room. \u201cThe not-salt in the air is listening. You know that heavy feeling when the world is deciding whether to be so kind it embarrasses you or so cruel it makes you shut up for an hour? That\u2019s this.\u201d\n\nMireya is very still, which is how I know she is thinking in a way that might burn her edges. She looks into the lagoon as if she is looking down into a pot that needs another minute, reading the surface for lies. \u201cYou wrote yourself into a thing that eats itself for breakfast,\u201d she says, but her voice is not scolding and not affectionate either; it is the sound you make when you tell a sourdough to be good and it decides to impress you with a new shape. \u201cNow it will come find you when it thinks it should stop itself and it cannot help it. Paper likes women like you because you taste like rules and broken promises. We will make a habit now of going where you are called. I do not like it. I will do it. We will do it,\u201d she adds, because she is made to say unhappy commitments in public.\n\n\u201cSaturdays and Tuesdays,\u201d Jude sings, making a calendar noise with his teeth. \u201cWe will have a dance card.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wrists will be booked,\u201d I tell him, and then I loosen my grip on the black pen and think about how many fences I am allowed to draw before I have to climb one and scrape my knees. The man with the keys walks past us to a little side door and glances at us and nods like we are mosquitoes that learned not to bite a baby for five minutes. I nod back like I am a person who can distinguish between being tolerated and being invited. I am not great at that. I am working on it. I am going to write this down in a notebook with a goat on the cover that I haven\u2019t bought yet.\n\nDriving south, the ocean on the right looks very busy in that fake way water has of pretending that what it is doing matters to you. The billboards are already yelling about insurance and ice cream and I know which one I will listen to. Jude is quiet in the passenger seat, reverent when he knows a thing has happened which is not a story yet because if we make it a story too fast it will turn on us for having bad manners. He touches the side of my hand with the back of his knuckles and it is deliberate comfort, the kind that does not announce itself like a parade.\n\nI drop him at Sea Dragon and promise to tell Abuela the piece that will make her laugh so that she doesn\u2019t keep the towel this time like proof that I live under her fear. The shop is a collage of the same faces again, and the same faces are new because the wind has moved and told everyone\u2019s hair different things. A woman buys a candle shaped like a house because her landlord has become a different person this year and she needs a small permission. A man wants to return oil because it made him dream of a cousin he doesn\u2019t want to see and we both pretend it was a mistake in the bottle instead of in him. The girl with the scab comes back to smell the rosemary and brings a friend who wears her sadness like a new jacket. There are four quarters on the floor near the register by the time I sweep at three and I take exactly one of them and leave the other three for the container that keeps its own rules because luck likes to think we don\u2019t notice it.\n\nWhen we lock the door for an hour because Abuela says I need to eat soup if I am going to be allowed to make any decisions after five, she makes me sit at the back table and watch the steam like it is television. The soup is indeed too salty because Tavo brought it and put his pride into it and then forgot to check the ocean in his mouth, so I squeeze a lemon over it and we both watch the little storm that makes and right away. Abuela takes one sip and makes the face she makes when she is thinking of my mother, which is the face of a woman who tries not to be funny in church and fails. She says Mireya\u2019s name and makes it into a different word by putting her tongue on her teeth. She says Trouble like it is a new kind of music.\n\n\u201cShe said we would go where I am called,\u201d I tell her, because that and the gull and the scheduled test are the things I can say without the salt in my kitchen teasing me for telling stories in the wrong order. \u201cShe said paper likes me. She is angry about that, which makes me trust her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is angry about everything that thinks it can live without a mouth,\u201d Abuela says, tearing up a piece of pan dulce like she is undoing a mistake someone made with a blanket. \u201cRot is a mouth. Rot is a mouth that teaches you to pay attention to what is soft. If you do not listen to it, it will shout. If you ask it nicely, it will whisper all your secrets into the dirt and you will be safe again. But you must ask nicely. Mold does not forget when you are rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho will ask us nicely?\u201d I ask, because sometimes the world can feel like a line of people who want me to line up behind them. \u201cWho will say, please, to my face, instead of making a door inside my ear with a note that says late?\u201d\n\nShe takes my hand and puts it on the towel like it will remember the shape of it and then we will be able to tell if it changes while we\u2019re not looking. \u201cYou will,\u201d she says. \u201cYou will say please to yourself before any door. Then the door will not own you. It will be a friend you can be rude to when she is rude to you. Now bring me that black pen. I am going to write a letter to whatever piece of paper comes for you next. I will say, leave your shoes at the door. I will say, wipe your feet. I will say, there are old women here who do not care about your job title. I will say, try to be on time. I will say, if you wake my granddaughter too early, I will make beans and not give you any.\u201d\n\nThe salt square in my kitchen hums again after dark, and I go to it like a person might go to the mailbox in a small town where the mailman is your father and knows your secrets anyway. The ring it left has dried into a pale map that I know is a place but cannot place. The square itself has taken on a soft sheen that gives it a face in certain lights if I want it to, and I mostly do not. The note under the pepper has curled a little, the blue ink resisting the way paper tries to lie down and be less of a person. The coin under my palm is a truth I can hold, the copper always wanting to be more than one thing at once\u2014a face, a moon, a bite of electricity. I draw a fence on my own skin with the black pen and then wash it off because I am not about to let ink discipline me. The wind is not done doing weird things in this city; it knocks and doesn\u2019t wait and I refuse to make that a habit.\n\nThe day after the tour, the bees at Mireya\u2019s stand at the market are unbothered again like nothing happened and that is a different kind of warning. The woman in the tunnel has a thermos someone brought her and her girls have painted a flower in the curve of the culvert that is so ugly it makes me love it more. Jude puts salt on his grapefruit because he is perverse and laughs like he is editing his own heart with a pen nobody can see. The gull with the nicked wing steals an entire bag of potato chips from a man on a bench and the man lets him because there are some fights we want to lose. The pier makes old man noises because it likes to make me think it could fall apart and never does.\n\nI am not a tower if I kneel, the note said, and I practice it in my hallway where nobody has to see me fail in such an ordinary way. I kneel to tie my shoe. I kneel to pick up a drop of soup I spilled because I cannot talk without my hands. I kneel to smell the rosemary where it hangs by the door, the good petty plant, and I feel ridiculous and grateful and like the kind of person I used to make fun of when I was sixteen and thought rituals were just costumes and not love made into appointments. When I stand, the world is still the world, which is a relief and a disappointment in equal measure.\n\nThree days after the tour, a piece of paper arrives folded into itself like a shy animal. It is not mail because it does not have my address, and it is not a note because it does not address me, and it is not a permit because it has no numbers, which is a shame because I like to count the kinds of trouble I am about to get into. It is slid under the shop door in that moment before opening, when we have the door open a breath and the bell looks like it wants to try a new sound. Abuela picks it up like it might stain her hand and then looks at me like I brought it with my mouth, and I did, by writing back to a thing that expected me to be polite.\n\nOn the paper is a photocopy of a map, the kind from when the city was young and men with mustaches made decisions on a Tuesday and nobody argued with them until it mattered. The river is long where it is not now, the canyons are bigger where they have been told to be small, the ocean\u2019s lip is drawn like a skirt, and someone has taken a pen, not a black one, a blue one that lies, and drawn a circle. The circle is around a place I know the way you know the back of a person\u2019s head in a crowd before you know their voice.\n\n\u201cBarrio Logan,\u201d I say, feeling stupid and right at once, because the map is old enough that it calls it by a worse name and the circle is not on our block, not exactly, but near the place where the paint never dries and children climb each other to be higher. It is near the yards where they weld and the air tastes like work. It is near the freeway\u2019s bad dream, where it runs over us like a decision that never stops making the same mistake. It is near the water, which is trying to pretend she is not pinned down. \u201cIt is the place where the river used to pretend to be a creek and then pretend to be a ditch and then pretend to be a storm drain and then pretend to be a memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cLate,\u201d Abuela says, but she says it the way a person says grace, and then she blows on her coffee like she could cool the city with that one breath if she wanted to try. Mireya texts me a picture of a culture blooming on a plate into a flower that looks obscene and proud and writes, it is time to ask the bed to move. Jude sends a heart, then writes, I have a new shirt from the thrift, it is the exact color of a bruise on a peach. The salt square on my counter makes its tiny noise and cracks one thin crack more. The coin quivers in my pocket like it is a cheap compass and I am the wrong pole.\n\nWe go to the circle on the map on a Thursday because that is a rude day and this is a rude job. The freeway overpasses tangle overhead like fingers that didn\u2019t ask consent. The pillars wear their murals like persons, saints and women and the dead watching us with the relief of being above the ground for once. The underpass is an echo factory. The skid of skateboards is a prayer if you listen like you\u2019re supposed to. Children ride bikes around grownups\u2019 conversations as if they are planets testing orbits. The smell is paint and tire and mango and the kind of meat someone will yell at you about if you try to tell them it isn\u2019t good for them. The wind cannot decide who she belongs to under here and keeps walking away and coming back like a lover with a math degree.\n\nThe circle is a drain, of course it is, a pretty one because the art students came through at some point and decided that even holes need dresses. Around it, someone chalked a poem that has mostly rubbed away, leaving only the words mouth and remember and stay. The grate is clogged with the kind of story that makes nice people judge other people\u2014wrappers and cigarette ends and hair and petals from a celebration, confetti from a life. The world shakes off what it cannot keep everywhere you go; we just notice it more in these classrooms. The smell has that same wrong a note makes when you pick it out of a chord and give it its own room. It is salt, not new, this is not foam, this is not a prank, this is an argument that forgot how to be funny.\n\n\u201cReturn,\u201d Mireya says, the word not a question and not a complaint, and then in a murmur toward the grate she says destr\u00f3zate con cari\u00f1o, break yourself with love, and I realize she is talking to the kind of salt that needs reminding that not all destruction is the same. She kneels and puts her ear to the iron the way my mother used to put her ear to the wall and tell me which of the neighbors was fighting without actually wanting to know. Jude looks up, crossing his eyes to look at whichever seagull is trying to learn a new route, and counts under his breath, a baker counting for dough he will punch. I stand with the coin in my hand and let the black pen weigh the pocket under my hip because this is a paper place, a mean one, a legal one.\n\nThe grate doesn\u2019t sing. It has nothing left for art. It slumps under our attention like the tent at the market did, in a way that hurts less as drama and more as fate. The smell stings my eyes and I do not cry because I can hear a child laughing two pillars over, and that is a fence you are not allowed to cross if you want to pretend you do this for anyone other than yourself. I flip the coin once and catch it, stupid thing, trick my grandfather taught me that made me believe I could keep luck caged for a minute. The metal is cooler under here and the face on it is smoothed into abstraction by the sea, so I think of it as not a president but a woman with a laurel who used to be a fish.\n\n\u201cWhat did the map want,\u201d I ask the coin like an aunt who is a witch and a cat and a lie, \u201cwhen it circled you?\u201d I wait because this is a city where waiting is an occupation and because doors hate to be rushed by women. The coin warms in my palm and then in my other palm when I move it there and I say my full name again because it feels like a necessary indignity. I place the coin on the grate because I am a witch and a child and a person who believes metal likes to talk to metal. I write a fence around the hole with the black pen, which is nonsense and also ritual and also graffiti for people who prefer their revolutions legible only to ghosts.\n\nThe first drop is a joke, almost polite, just a little wet where there should be nothing. Then it moves like a sigh, skin trying to form and failing, the way the river did at Dog Beach, but this is not water doing water things; it is a mouth trying to speak and making a mess. The brine is not white here. It is clear and heavy and makes the air smell like a dead battery and a cut lemon at once. It is a visitor who did not bring a gift. It does not belong to this mouth. It is here because paper found a crack and water loves cracks more than it loves us.\n\n\u201cSing,\u201d Abuela says inside my head like she always does when my throat tightens with a brave thing I thought I wanted to do that turns out to be something I have to do. The options are always the same: open and walk, close and sing. Under concrete, at the edge of the shop, at the mouth of the tunnel, under the freeway like a kitchen under an armpit, the list keeps right on being rude about being short.\n\nI put my mouth near and I do the ugly song again because if I try for pretty I will lie, and the door will like me but it will not respect me. The note of it, the one in my ribs and not in my jaw, finds the part of the grate that isn\u2019t grate but a hinge, the part that remembers opening. The crack becomes a different shape, shorter and meaner, a thing that doesn\u2019t get to be a corridor anymore. Mireya hums through her nose in a way that makes me want to kiss the freckles nobody gave her and never will, and then she takes a jar from her basket and unscrews it under the edge where nobody can see because nobody is looking at us hard enough except the saints on the pillars, and she tips a whisper of culture into the crack like a secret. It blooms so subtly it might have been imagination\u2014no fuzz, no color, just a change in the way the stink sits, like the air just remembered its manners in church.\n\nJude does not make jokes because he can tell that laughter would be a wrong door, so he does his other holy work and counts, timing the drip to his heartbeat until the beat decides it prefers a different number. He concentrates on his wrists and makes his hands useful without touching anything, which is the trick of all men who do not want to be mistaken for the wrong kind of help. The drip slows. The skin makes and breaks and makes and tries to forget the trick it just learned. The paper that led someone to hook something into something under the street does not like us here, and it flutters in the pockets of the men going to work like a bird that cannot choose a tree.\n\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d I ask the hole like it is a person, which is an insult only if you are a person who does not like being asked plain questions, and I am not that kind of person. \u201cI brought no salt. I brought a coin. I brought my grandmother\u2019s patience up to here and my mother\u2019s terrible reckless everything over here, and I brought a pen that thinks it is a fence and likes to pretend words are animals. I can shut you. I can open you. I can sing or I can walk. Choose.\u201d\n\nIt is not speaking to hear it, what happens\u2014there is the minute change in the breath of someone behind me, the undercut of a skate wheel over a seam in the concrete, the very quiet not-cough of a gull, the reverb of the freeway deciding on a key. The brine stops pretending to want to be anything but itself. It pulls back in a kind of embarrassment I do not want to personify for it because I am trying to be kind. The compound smell dulls, then relocates itself to the place in my memory where batteries live. The coin jumps\u2014really jumps\u2014a millimeter under my palm and then lies there like a dead fish the way coins do when they are asked to be normal. The grate remains a grate. The note in my kitchen, which I cannot see, notes it in that way it has of writing after the fact like a mother who texts you to say she dreamed of you after you got home.\n\n\u201cScheduled test,\u201d I murmur, and I laugh because I cannot stop myself from making jokes that try to make the world feel less like a bar that never closes. The chalk poem around the drain loses the word stay to a skateboard wheel, and the child with the baby on her chest walks past us and says aloud to the air, \u201cIf you have to pee, hold it, mijo,\u201d and I think, yes, actually, that is exactly what we just asked the world to do.\n\nAfter we stand and pretend to be just women again instead of doors, Miriam from the hair place walks by and gives me that up and down that women give women they have known since middle school, the scan that cradles everything and complains about nothing. She says, \u201cYou look tired,\u201d which is our hello, and I say, \u201cRescheduled,\u201d which is our good-bye, and we both mean the part where the world continues to happen anyway. The bees, when we walk past the little citrus tree that someone has courageously planted in a place that will never be nice to it, are busy and uncomplicated. The wheels of cars roll over the same piece of concrete and you can hear them not making up their minds about whether to love it here. A welding spark jumps and falls like a star, and nobody names it.\n\nMireya presses her shoulder into mine once and makes the smallest sound, a human not-quite-hum that might be a thank you and might be a complaint and might be both, and then she stands away because we are not saying love on concrete today. She has flours in her hair again like she went home between the tour and this and wrestled a recipe to the ground. She will go to her stand and sell someone a wedge of something that will make their tongues decide to behave better for an hour. She will make jokes with a man who thinks he invented them. She will text me a picture of a jar of milk as if it is a baby and I will kiss the screen like a fool. Jude will go teach a boy how to frost something that does not want to be frosted and call it a spiritual practice. Abuela will tell a woman that her headache is from a man and not from the weather and the woman will cry and feel better and then worse and then spend seven dollars on a candle that will be very good to her whether she deserves it or not.\n\nAt night, the bottom drawer in my kitchen makes the noise it makes when something wants to be let out and is being polite about it. The salt square has changed in the way it always does\u2014it has turned more itself by a hair, which is a miracle that makes me tired and proud. The ring on the counter is an empire after a haircut. The note is a weather report for my heart. It says, we looked. It says, you sang. It says, someone tried a door at your shop when you were not there and will come back when you are. It adds a line, the handwriting stitching smaller and meaner and prettier with every night: the wind will ask you to pick a name. The coin is warm when I wake and cold when I lie down, which is my own trick too.\n\nWhen I do sleep, it is in the hour where late stops being a word and becomes a country. The pier is in my dream because it always is, and it is both falling and not falling, which is exactly like loving anyone, and at the end of it there is a gate, and the gate has a paper taped to it with my grandmother\u2019s handwriting that says, close like a mouth after you take a bite. The gull is there, rude cousin, and he lets me pet the good wing and that is how I know it is a dream. The wind says my name, middle and first, and then breaks into a thousand girls laughing like they just took off their shoes on a hot day and ran into the spray.\n\nI wake with a list in my mouth and say it into the dark like a spell. Bring the black pen and a towel and a lemon. Don\u2019t bring salt. Wear the wrong hat. Don\u2019t say love on concrete. Put the coin on the paper like a seal. Sing if you cannot walk. Walk if you cannot sing. Let paper be a person you can flirt with and say no to. Be late only in ways that the square allows. Answer the door when nobody knocks. Teach the grate its manners. Tell the culvert a joke. Ask the bees if they like your new hair. Stop at the market for peaches and forgiveness. Remember that you are the person at the pier whether or not anyone is watching and whether or not the tide lies to your face.\n\nIn the morning, the class of fifth graders on a field trip to the shop proves to me that the only real magic left is the noise thirty children can make with their hands when they are allowed to touch every candle on a shelf. One of them, a boy with a scowl that looks borrowed from his uncle, stares up at the mural above our door and says very serious, \u201cHer eyes move,\u201d and then shrugs when his friend tells him he\u2019s stupid because he is not, not at all, not in the ways that matter. I give them bad advice and good candy and send them into the day with rosemary under their nails and the idea lodged in their heads that doors can be pointed at things and not only on hinges. When they leave, the quiet comes back like a cat that forgives me once a day for not talking to it the right way.\n\nI wait for the wind to ask me for a name. I wait for the paper to try a new trick. I wait for Mireya to ask me for something I do not know how to give her and will find that I do, in the wrong pocket, in a jar in the back room, in a song I hate. I am bad at waiting in the way that women in my family are bad at waiting\u2014we make soup while we wait and then we feed the city and the city is less mean to us for a minute. The world phones me while I am cutting string and doesn\u2019t leave a message because she knows I will call back. The note under the pepper lifts its bottom edge and lies still when I look at it and I do not pretend to be surprised. The coin keeps its counsel and my hand keeps smelling like lemon even when I wash it four times. The bees memorize my wrist. The pier is the same and entirely different. The tower is a card in the deck that I have refused to lose and refused to draw and I can feel it every time I shuffle.\n\nIt rains in August one afternoon the length of a cigarette and the city acts like someone kissed it with teeth, surprised and insulted and hiding how much it liked it. The salt square glows in the gray like a lie that wants to be a truth. The paper at the desal plant has a little box next to a line that has existed for years and nobody ever drew in, and now it is there and we all pretend it was always there because admission is messy and recordkeeping is cleaner. The gull steals fries from a girl with two rings in her mouth and she lets him because she is trying out being generous. The woman from the tunnel hums a pickup line at a cop and gets away with it because she is braver than God. I sell a bundle to a man who looks at me like I look like his sister and for five minutes I let him and then he remembers his own and pays in cash.\n\nWe are not late, not exactly, not anymore, not in the way the paper meant. We are right on time in the way a lemon is right on time when your mouth forgets to be kind. We stand on thresholds like we were built to and our knees hurt a little and we laugh too hard and the city makes a noise like a stove cooling down. The wind asks me for a name while I am rinsing rice for dinner, the question so clear it comes out of the faucet with the water: what will you call what you do so you can say no to all the other names. I say, I am the woman at the pier who drops a coin and writes back to permits with a pen that thinks it is a fence. I say, I am Marisol who is Sol who is Mari who is the middle one and the end one and the one who brings extra lemons in case. I say, I am thresholds like my grandmother said, and I am tired enough to be beautiful when I do something that hurts. The wind says, okay. The wind says, then come outside.The wind\u2019s voice is not the same as the ocean\u2019s, and I know that tonight because when I step into the hallway with my shoes in my hand, it says my name like it has an appointment with me and not like it\u2019s hoping I\u2019ll wander past. It comes in segments, in square breaths that make the doorjambs quiver and the light over the stairwell flicker like it\u2019s thinking about being a lighthouse and then remembers electricity is a job. I put my palm to the wall and feel the faint shiver of other people\u2019s television laughter and the deep bass of a neighbor\u2019s fight that is so old it has learned to only speak in sighs. The coin bumps my thigh like a nervous fish. I go down the stairs sock-footed until the concrete tells me it is time to be a person again, and I put my shoes on and tie them with the kind of care I reserve for a ritual I refuse to name. Outside, the air is a spoonful of warm honey and dust, sweet until the back of my tongue finds the sting.\n\nI don\u2019t lock the door because Abuela is awake with her rosary in a pile on her lap like a string of small headaches, and because the building knows my feet as well as I know its temper. The street is the sort of empty that makes you think you misplaced a holiday. A man in a sweatshirt with the hood up walks his insomnia back and forth in front of the liquor store, and a palm tree scolds the sky the way old women scold children at the bus stop for forgetting their sweaters. The mural above our shop is awake in the light from the streetlamp, the six hands looking like they have been asked too many favors and will answer anyway if I stand here long enough with my mouth trying to memorize a word. When I whisper \u201cportera,\u201d because I am not clever enough to come up with a new name and I am tired of saying witch to people who hear different music, the eyes in the painted palms do that thing they did when I was small and insistent, that soft double step that tells me I am not wrong to believe I am being watched with love.\n\nThe wind wants me to go toward the pier and I want to go toward the alley, and for two blocks we negotiate like cousins. The city at this hour is mostly cats and freight. A trolley mutters secrets to itself on the tracks. A pair of lovers use the hood of a car as if it is the only flat surface that can hold their conversation, and I look away because I know what Abuela would say about concrete and declarations. The gull with the nicked wing ghosts me from pole to pole, looking sated and smug, which is how gulls look when they have done something rude and were not punished. At Broadway he descends and walks with me like a dog who refuses a leash, heels like he learned posture in a previous life, and when I stop at a crosswalk because the light tells me to, he looks offended like I have embarrassed him in front of a friend.\n\nWhen I get to the end of the pier, the boards are not doing their ghost-mouth trick, which is almost worse. The black of the water is honest in a way it forgets to be when there are crowds to entertain. A fisherman stands hunched over his bucket like he owes it rent. A boy throws a net badly and then better and I fall in love with him for six seconds and then remember I am not allowed to collect new boys for stories like baseball cards. The wind is stronger here and it is not a weather; it is a posture. It sets its shoulders and tells the flags to behave. It opens its palm and lets small trash perform their ballet. It smells like basil and motor and the inside of a clean cup fresh from a cupboard nobody opens enough.\n\n\u201cPortera,\u201d it says in that square way, and I nod like we have met at a party and are pretending we are friends. The word sits comfortably on the inside of my lip, like a cut I keep touching with my tongue. It is not the kind of power you put on a business card. It is the kind you write inside your own name and underline twice and don\u2019t tell the boy you are kissing because it will scare him in a way he will call romantic. I take the coin out and balance it on my middle finger like a second knuckle. The gull shifts his weight and mutters something obscene at me in bird, which is a dialect that sounds a lot like cigarettes in a church parking lot.\n\nI\u2019m expecting a door in the obvious places\u2014under the boards, in the black water where the city keeps its bad temper, in the air where the salt makes shapes like saints. The door is not a hole tonight, and when I finally feel it, it is because the hairs on my wrists lean toward the street instead of the ocean, and the pier itself shifts its attention like a man in a pew whose phone lit up in his pocket. The door is in the lights. The streetlamps along the promenade are elbowing each other like men at a bar, and the hum they make has a seam down the middle that didn\u2019t used to be there, a split, a hinge. I have never put my hand on a city light with anything but dislike\u2014too white, too sure\u2014but I do it now because the wind asks me to and because I am tired of letting the wrong things be in charge of my etiquette. The metal is warm and mostly indifferent. Then it isn\u2019t. Then it pays attention like it has never been asked to before, like its job description always included answering me and nobody told it.\n\n\u201cOpen?\u201d I ask, and the word is not a magic word so much as an introduction to a conversation that is going to take the rest of my life. The light flickers, and for a second the edge where the globe meets the neck is more than hardware. I see a thin black line like the lid of an eye, and behind it, not light, not dark, but a small square of in-between that looks like the inside of my grandmother\u2019s purse where the pennies have lived very long lives. The wind presses against my back like a person who has forgotten where I end and they begin, and I put my mouth close to the seam because I was not taught to be afraid of doors smaller than my hand.\n\nThe first thing that comes through is not a voice, but an absence, as if the light forgot to burn and instead remembered to listen. There is the paper scratch that accompanies bureaucracy when it is trying to seduce you into thinking you are being included, and there is a lemon rind bitterness at the back of my throat that tells me salt has been thinking about me. I say my name in that slow, two-handed way, the way you pass a heavy dish down a table, and the seam widens as much as a blink. It\u2019s nothing and it\u2019s enough. Behind it, I do not see anything that would make sense if I describe it. I see heat gathered into a fold. I see dust arranged like a choir. I see an index of laughter.\n\n\u201cWalk or sing,\u201d I hear in the part of my head where my mother keeps her leftover advice, and it is an easier choice than I want it to be. I am tired enough to walk even if the floor is a question. I am smart enough to sing if the crowd asks me to. I put the coin against the seam and the metal does not spark and does not bite me and does not anything except admit the fact of my knuckle. The door opens the way a mouth opens when you decide to forgive someone because it is easier than hating them that day. I step my left foot in first because I am not an idiot and because my body is making decisions faster than my brain can get a hand up to interrupt.\n\nInside is a hall that is not a hall, and I know it because it has more corners than a geometry book and none of them behave. It smells like cheap paper and wanted things, the way zoning proposals smell when they are printed in back rooms by men who do not live in the neighborhood they are measuring. It smells like beeswax over those smells, which is somebody\u2019s grandmother insisting the mess be pretty. There are drawers in the air, shallow ones, like the kind you keep flat things in and pretend are organized. There are lists that fidget when I pass them, like children who can\u2019t help but kick the back of a chair. The wind cannot come this far and be itself, so it follows me as a polite chaperone, a hand to the small of my back that never touches me and will shout my name if I try to open something that isn\u2019t mine.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I am in the lamp, which is the sort of sentence only a person I do not want to be caught by would write, but the city keeps doing its shallow breathing outside and the boy with the net laughs and drops the weight of his net on his own shoe and says a word his mother would have pretended not to hear. The drawers open not when I pull them, but when I remember the thing they were meant to hide, which is maybe always how drawers work if you are honest. The first one is a sheaf of maps like the one that found us at the shop\u2014long river, narrow river, nonexistent river, the line of the freeway like a signature pretending to be a spine. Someone circled places and then circled them again until the pen broke through the page in a perfect, ugly little hole. Someone wrote Not Yours in a tidy corner and then crossed it out, and I love them without reservation for their temporary bravery. The second drawer holds a stack of stamped receipts that all say \u201creceived\u201d in the kind of ink that looks old immediately, which is a trick paper plays to make you forget it just learned how to walk.\n\nThere are permits, yes, not the ones we saw, not the show papers, but their mothers, drafts with the big words crooked and the numbers crossed out and the notes in the margins that say we can get away with it if we call it something else. There are memos named for innocence that talk about \u201cemergency authorization,\u201d and they smell like coffee and sunscreen and the inside of somebody\u2019s Lexus. There are names. There are all the ways a city says yes to itself without asking its body. I make myself read without flinching for as long as I can stand it, which is not long, and then I fold the corner of one paper with the most audacity and tuck that corner under the corner of another and make them promise to argue about it while I sleep.\n\nWhen I close the drawers they do not resist me. Nobody is trying to trap me here except my own predisposition to be precocious. I take out my black pen because I promised myself I would, and I write on the air where the list keeps trying to arrange itself, a fence I can fit a woman through. It\u2019s not law. It\u2019s the neighbor who sits on her porch and watches and whose mouth is so small you never expect the things she will say when she finally lifts her hand. If wind at east, howl at ten and not at three. If brine at mouth, place your tongue in your own cheek and wait. If bees in circle break, close the window, not the hive. If a gull with a nick looks at you, say, I see you, and do not lie. If a grandmother\u2019s towel dries slow, do not ask for rain; ask why you forgot to wring it. Do not take permission from anyone who cannot say your name without your middle. Do not sign what you could sing. Do not sing what you could walk. Do not walk if a child is asleep on your shoulder.\n\nI step out of the lamp because it is polite to leave before you are asked, and because the wind wants to say something to me and refuses to come inside. The gull is temporarily uninterested in me and is yelling at another gull about a french fry near a trash can that will tip like a drunk if anyone asks it to dance. The fisherman looks up and then looks down, and that could be my magic or it could be the beautiful arrogance of a man ignoring a miracle for his own sanity. The boy with the net swears again and does it better. A woman in a jacket with an old band\u2019s name on the back leans her chin on the rail and gives the ocean the kind of dirty look you give a lover you refuse to stop going home to.\n\nThe wind laughs as much as something square can laugh. It puffs my hair up until I look violent. It presses its single word against my jaw. \u201cOkay,\u201d it says again, and this time the okay is not permission and not compliment; it is agreement, like two women at a bus stop who do not want to be having the same thought and are united by it anyway. It has a job for me and I know it, and it is not a job with a diagram and payment. It is a job as old as the part where people believed water was listening to them even when it was busy being itself.\n\nIn the morning, I pretend I am going to be reasonable. I put on the normal shirt for selling candles to people who do not want to talk about why they are buying them. I put the coin in the pocket that does not feel like a shrine. I make Jude coffee that tastes the way he likes\u2014too sweet, almost vanilla, the color of a friendship bracelet\u2014because he is coming by before opening to tell me the story of a woman who cried at Sea Dragon because frosting looks like snow and snow is not a California memory, and Jude is collecting other people\u2019s weather the way some people collect shells. He arrives with a croissant that looks like it was rolled by a mean grandma and hugs me so hard my shoulder pops, and when I tell him I climbed into a streetlight, he closes his eyes like he is having the kind of fun that makes him late to work.\n\n\u201cYou are going to get electrocuted by a metaphor,\u201d he says, and then kisses my forehead like he is a mother I got from the thrift store. \u201cWe have a meeting this week,\u201d he adds like it is the same sentence, that city council desk-of-doom thing where people who think they invented neighbors get to say a bunch of words at us and then ask us to be impressed by their ability to pronounce the names of streets that existed before their parents did.\n\nI know about the meeting because the paper told me in the lamp in the way paper always tells you, with a schedule that pretends to have been agreed upon by everyone because nobody was invited to disagree. It is at six on Thursday because that is when it can be said that the city is welcoming and also when most people are wiping the day off their faces and not in the mood to kiss a microphone. The agenda is tart and orderly. \u201cAdjustments to Outfall Procedure.\u201d \u201cEmergency Variance Reauthorization.\u201d \u201cCommunity Comment (Three-Minute Time Limit).\u201d There is a little box next to \u201cCommunity Comment\u201d and in that box, in the lamp, I drew another box because it is what I had. The box is nothing and the box is a fence and the box is a song, and if I am not careful, I will believe my own trick.\n\nAbuela is unimpressed when I tell her about the streetlight, which is to say she is secretly delighted and will not let me know because she wants me to be braver and not think bravery gets me out of sweeping. She straightens the towel over her shoulder and takes my face in her hand and makes me open my mouth like I might be hiding something under my tongue and speaking around it. \u201cSay your name like a curse and like a prayer,\u201d she instructs, which is not new, and then she adds, \u201cBring eggs to the meeting. They do not like to be seen by eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to throw them?\u201d I ask, and she gives me the look she saves for the moments when I pretend not to know better.\n\n\u201cBring them to sit next to your heart,\u201d she says. \u201cPaper has eyes for heat. If it sees a child, it will decide to behave. Sometimes. Bring a towel. Bring the black pen. Bring money for parking even though you can be rude about parking if you have to. Wear shoes you can kneel in. Wear no perfume because perfume is lying and this week we are not lying more than we have to.\u201d\n\nMireya texts me the single most domestic photograph I have ever seen from her, a colander of lemons that looks like a sculpture of a woman\u2019s mouth breathing, and writes, \u201cThursday. I will bring the patron saint of mold in a jar and keep him in my bag unless the air starts to behave like a tongue that needs reminding. Wear your wrist bones out. Those help.\u201d She adds a photo of her ankles in socks with goats on them, which I am not sure is a threat or a blessing. I send her a picture of my black pen and my worst hat and my coin in my palm, the lines of the copper faking constellations, and she sends back a voice message that is only a laugh and it sits under my ribs like a found penny.\n\nThe shop is busy the next two days in the way that happens when people can smell something they can\u2019t name and think they can hide it by buying something that smokes. A woman from National City tells me she woke up with salt on her windowsill and that she knows how ridiculous that sounds, and I tell her it sounds like a letter address and she cries for exactly the amount of time it takes for me to find the good rosemary, not the polite kind. A man buys another baby-shaped candle and does not make eye contact because he has started to suspect the baby is not changing his neighbor\u2019s drumming and that he might have to be the person who asks. Teenagers make nests of their own knees in the corner and talk about teachers as if teachers are mythical beasts, and I sell them a bundle of basil like I am the aunt who gives them a bus pass in secret.\n\nAt night, the salt square does not write. It sits like a small elegant person who refuses to perform for company. The ring on the counter fades and then returns, and the pattern changes just enough that if I stare at it long enough I can convince myself I am learning a new language. The note under the pepper has a new line in the small script: \u201cIf you must be late, bring a chair for the person who isn\u2019t.\u201d The coin goes hot-cold hot-cold in my pocket in a pattern that, if I were a worse person, I would say feels like an instrument tuning itself. The gull with the nick or his cousin or his wife stares at me from the lamppost every time I look up, and one afternoon when I am making change with my hands like a magician, he throws a peanut shell at the window like he wants me to know I could never survive in his family.\n\nThe day of the meeting, the light is the kind that makes people\u2019s teeth look better than their intentions. The marine layer gave up at eleven and roared off like a bored aunt, and the sky has the angry clarity that makes tourists fight with each other about whether they packed the right shoes. I dress like a polite person. I dress like the kind of woman men thank from the dais. I dress like I am about to tell the truth and apologize afterward for not being a different shape. I put two hard-boiled eggs in my bag next to the black pen and the mirror and the towel, and I tell Jude if he eats them because he thinks it\u2019s funny I will bite him on the wristbone where it will bruise scenic. He wears the bruise-colored thrift-store shirt and looks like a civil servant lost in a poem. He wears cologne because he is a liar and I tell him to knock it off at the door, and he rubs his wrists on a rosemary bush and complains about being made into a salad, and a woman passing by says, \u201cThat is not an insult,\u201d without breaking stride and I wish I had wrote that down.\n\nCity Hall wears its history in stale air and marble like gilt on a saint, and I love it in the way you love the house where you had your childhood fevers. There is the big room where they do the important pretending, with its speakers and its high walls and its parking-lot chairs dressed up like church, and then there is the anteroom where paper flirts with paper on bulletin boards and notices curl at the corners from the humidity of mouths. We put our names on the slip for public comment. The clipboard weighs more than it should. There is the three-minute timer like a joke in bad taste. There are men in shirts that fit their stories and women in shoes that make them respectable, and there are a few of us dressed like we do the work of holding the world down while it kicks.\n\nKristin is there in a suit that makes me want to put her feet in a bowl of hot water and peel a clementine for her while I scold her for doing a job she\u2019s too good at. The Compliance Director is there with a stack of paper that could be biblically unkind or extremely boring depending on who reads it. There is a man from a consulting firm whose jawline suggests he has never sweated in public, and he says \u201cdispersion\u201d like a dessert. There are a few grandmothers lined up like saints outside a bad bar. There are three kids who brought their skateboards and changed their minds inside and now hold their boards with embarrassment and devotion because they wanted the boards to see this too, in the way you bring your child to something that will hurt and help. Nobody has salt because the signs at the door reversed themselves for us and said \u201cNo Weapons,\u201d and we obeyed because weapons are a word paper uses when it wants to remind you it can be scared.\n\nWe are late in the good way because our names go on the second page of the public comment sheet in the spots that don\u2019t make people sigh when they sit there waiting to sing their three minutes into a clock. We are on time in the way my mother taught me to be, warm and unrushed and with our wrists clean. Abuela sits at the end of our row and does not clap for anyone because she doesn\u2019t clap in rooms with microphones. She holds one of the eggs in her palm like it is a rosary she is considering converting to. Mireya sits with her knees neatly together like a woman in an old photograph and smells like caves and Tuesday, and when a man in a suit turns around and gets her scent on him, he looks confused and charmed like he almost remembers the shape of the first place he was ever brave.\n\nIt goes how it always goes and how it never goes. The people who start say the numbers and the way the pipe acts like a necklace when it is miles out and all the shapes it makes that are good shapes, and the diagrams have arrows that do the polite thing of curving away from the places with children and into the broad beloved nothing of ocean. The east wind is an anomaly. The reverse wind is a quirk. The brine is returned. The plant is a mother who is too tired to breastfeed all the time and must be forgiven for using a bottle sometimes because the baby will not notice if we are very good at pretending. A man says, \u201cWe are a thirsty city,\u201d and a woman says, \u201cWe are an innovative city,\u201d and another man says, \u201cWe are in compliance,\u201d and then someone remembers to say, \u201cWe understand your concern,\u201d because they have learned to say it in training and it has paid the rent on their car.\n\nThen it is the turn of the people who smell like rosemary and bus stops. A woman from a fishing family stands and tells the story about the day she went out too far and the water changed color in a way it doesn\u2019t do when what is in it is just itself moving around. She says, \u201cIt tasted wrong on my teeth,\u201d and a man in the second row flinches because he is so tired of not being allowed to use the good words. A teacher speaks for exactly three minutes with the exact quiet obscene intensity of a person who has counted children through a fire drill. A boy holds his skateboard like a shield and says, \u201cI can\u2019t skate under the bridge when it stinks like a battery,\u201d and looks at the floor like he might vomit because his voice did the thing voices do when you are proud and hate it.\n\nWhen it is our row, Jude stands first because he is the person who makes the jokes so the rest of us can be strict. He introduces himself with a title he invented and a bright smile like he is attacking the room with kindness, and he tells the room about bees not being drunk when they are confused, and the way a circle breaks when the air loses its manners, and how you can mist sugar to keep panic from being contagious. He says \u201cdispersion\u201d like a woman who is tired, and two men on the dais smile without meaning to, and it breaks their faces into people for half a second. He says thank you and then rolls the thank you on his tongue like he\u2019s tasting whether it deserves to be swallowed, and the buzzer doesn\u2019t get to him because he sits down before it remembers to try.\n\nMireya stands and the room adjusts its bra like it has a crush it doesn\u2019t want to call by name. She does not say her last name. She says, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d and everybody hears the other parts of the sentence. She says, \u201cWind moves like a woman who left and came back to get her earrings,\u201d and the stenographer laughs and then looks at her fingers like they misbehaved. She says, \u201cSalt is a worker and you cannot pay it with compliments,\u201d and she says, \u201cI make rot on purpose and I know the good kind when I smell it in a room,\u201d and she says, \u201cWhat you return is larger than your modeling will let you admit because you have taught your paper to believe a diagram more than it believes a child who says his boards won\u2019t roll.\u201d She does not raise her voice. She speaks like a deadline. She doesn\u2019t run out of time because when the little red light flicks, a bee appears out of the heating duct and lands on it and sits there until it turns green again, and yes, it is a coincidence, and yes, it\u2019s a miracle, and yes, it\u2019s a trick, and yes, it\u2019s the only reason the men on the dais get to hear the last sentence, which is, \u201cDo not ask us to drink your variance and call it rain.\u201d\n\nI stand because it\u2019s time and because the eggs in my bag have reached the exact temperature where they are the same as my body. I say my name the way I promised. I say I live on the block where the mural above the shop looks at you and has opinions. I say I have a grandmother who can hear a lie through the sink. I say I have put my ear to the tunnel. I say I have put my tongue on the wind. I say I have put my pen on paper that does not belong to me, but belongs to all of us who have to sleep with the windows open because we cannot afford air conditioning and so we inhale whatever experiment you think you can hide in a long paragraph. I say if you must make a bed under my house for the pipe to sleep in, move it on Thursdays when the wind is wrong. I say if your paper cannot write the word east in a sentence that ends with stop, then I will write it and tape it to your door. I say, \u201cDo not be late to your own decency,\u201d and the buzzer sounds and I have to stop, which is maybe the only time today a rule felt useful.\n\nThere are questions, and the questions are not bad questions if you devour them with the right sauce. There is a man who asks me if I am a scientist and I do not spit, and I say I am a person who knows a taste is a kind of data and you can put it on a graph if you are brave, and the woman next to him looks at her hands like she wants to take off her ring because it suddenly weighs more. There is a man who says \u201cperception\u201d and I say \u201cperception is a cousin of reality that sleeps on your couch and eats from your fridge and you have to love him because he lives there,\u201d and the man does not write that down because he does not want to admit it made his mouth want to smile. There is a question addressed to Mireya about \u201csources,\u201d and she tells the room she gets her milk from goats and her rot from the part of the air that has been hurt and still remembers how to cook. There is a question for Jude about his wrists and he gets to be funny and coy, and the room breathes, because we have to give it that, these small releases, or it will tremble itself apart.\n\nWhen the men in the chairs say \u201cwe will take your comments under advisement,\u201d the paper in the big black binder that lives in my bag now even if it never leaves the room quivers like a small dog in a storm. The man with the keys is there at the edge of the dais because he is everywhere paper is afraid, and he looks at me and nods in that way again, that mosquito truce. When they vote to continue the variance, because of course, because the story goes the way it goes until we ruin it, I feel something that is not surprise and not despair and is the quiet tightening a woman\u2019s mouth does when she decides she is going to be a problem for a long time but will continue to bring a towel.\n\nOutside on the steps, the wind does not bother to be square. It comes from the east and from the south and from the memory of somebody\u2019s mouth and it tastes like a lemon squeezed over the first soup of the day. The bees that followed Mireya are brief and disciplined and then gone, like theater. The gull with the nicked wing is eating a French fry out of a boy\u2019s hand because the boy is at the age where to be stolen from by a bird is the thing that makes the day feel holy. Abuela puts her palm on my forehead like a doctor and tells me my temperature is a prayer and that I need to eat if I am going to pretend to be wise again after seven.\n\nMireya does not hug me because we have agreed not to make confessions on concrete, but she stands close enough that our shoulders might as well, and she says, \u201cIt was always going to be Thursday. The bed will not move until someone falls out of it.\u201d She looks at the old smokestack far off like it owes her money. \u201cThere will be a night when they have to shut the pipe because they will be afraid of something that looks bad on paper and not because of anything real. That is your window. We will go then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will we do?\u201d I ask, because I am ridiculous like that, still wanting to see a to-do list taped to a saint\u2019s chest.\n\nShe looks at me like I am a drawer she knows better than to open in public. \u201cWe will bring lemons,\u201d she says. \u201cWe will bring a towel. We will bring the coin and your grandmother\u2019s love and Jude\u2019s wrists and the name you picked, and we will teach the outfall to say please.\u201d\n\nThat night, the salt square sings in a key I haven\u2019t learned, and I lie on the kitchen floor with my head under the cabinet like a person hiding from weather and I learn how to hum it until my mouth gives up trying to be beautiful. The ring on the counter grows a peninsula. The note under the pepper adds, in the smallest, sharpest hand yet, \u201cWhen they close, walk.\u201d The coin is so warm in my palm it feels like it has been under a tongue. I sleep with it under my pillow like a child and a queen and a thief, and when I dream, the pier is shorter than it has ever been, and the ocean is so close I could push her with my foot, and the wind lays its weight on my back like a mother who finally sat down.\n\nMorning says it was kidding about being kind. The forecast is a joke. The east wind comes with her hands full of small lies and somebody\u2019s hair. The city smells like bread and batteries, basil and bleach, a parade of things you were not supposed to put next to each other on the stove. The gulls act like executives who can see the emails we can\u2019t. The first text comes from Kristin at an hour too precise to be accidental: \u201cOutfall maintenance tonight. 1 a.m. Temporary shut down. Modeling requires test.\u201d The second text is from Jude: \u201cI stole a flashlight from the back room at Sea Dragon and I think it is haunted by a guy named Ron.\u201d The third is from Mireya: it is not words, just a photo of her hands with lemon rind under the nails and a streak of blue ink across her thumb that matches the color of the sky when it knows it\u2019s been lying.\n\nAbuela watches me put the towel in the bag and the eggs back in the fridge and the mirror in the scarf and the black pen into the pocket over my heart. She puts a lemon in my mouth and says \u201cwalk,\u201d and then she kisses the top of my head and says \u201csing,\u201d and I nod like a parrot and like a priest. When I step into the hallway, the wind says my name like it\u2019s bringing me a bill and then says okay again, and I say it back, because I am that kind of fool, and because I have learned that sometimes the only way out of a door is to be rude to it with grace.",

                              "content": "The tide tells lies. Or maybe I do. I can never quite tell which one of us starts it\u2014the long hiss of water pulling back over the rocks, the burr of my breath counting, the salt dampening my hairline while the sky sits dumb and bruised over Ocean Beach. The pier is a sketch in the half-light, an arm pointing into a gray that won\u2019t commit to morning, its barnacled elbow creaking to an old memory. I stand at the lip of the shore with a bag of salt and a bottle of rosemary oil and the copper coin Abuela keeps under the register for \u201cextra luck.\u201d I told myself I would come here to watch and nothing else, but the truth slides around like the foam, it gets into every space. I have always made circles when I\u2019m nervous.\n\nThe sand wants to swallow the circle before I finish it, like a mouth closing around a word. I trace faster, my finger cold, trying not to think about the way my heart is beating like a foot on a squeaky stair. I whisper the names of the soft things. Sea lettuce, eelgrass, cloud. My voice stumbles on cloud because the sky is just beginning to thin over Point Loma, letting a rash of pink show through, the same color as my first lipstick, the one Lina dared me to wear to finals. I press the copper coin into the center of the circle and rub rosemary on my wrists, the bottle clattering against my rings, my teeth clicking because I\u2019m chattering, though it\u2019s not actually that cold.\n\nThere\u2019s a tremor under the sand, a little sigh. Not a quake. A shrug. I learned to tell the difference before I learned to swim. Our part of the earth is always whispering like this, like a body muttering through a dream. Abuela says that\u2019s where the old spells fit best, under the talk, inside the place where things rub against each other. \u201cYou?\u201d she told me, tapping my forehead. \u201cYou are all thresholds, Marisol.\u201d She says my full name when she wants me to listen. \u201cFind your doors.\u201d\n\nA gull watches me, head cocked, his eyes the ridiculous yellow of plastic toys. He\u2019s missing two toes. When he hops closer, dragging his foot just enough to make me want to cry, I tell myself not to give him the coin. The ocean keeps and keeps; I cannot keep anything from it. I get down on my knees, jeans biting damp into my skin, and whisper my own names. Sol. Mari. The middle one only Abuela uses when she is trying to soften my stubbornness. I\u2019m twenty-six and I still bring her jars and money and my worst ideas for her to fix. I came here because of the card that fell out of her deck after dinner, The Tower, which was either an accident or a joke or a sign, and because Jude called me at midnight to say the kelp beds were strange up the coast, torn all to weird lace, \u201clike somebody chewed them,\u201d he said on the phone, whispering like he had a secret. Jude loves a secret like a lemon loves a knife.\n\nI pour the salt in a trickle with my left hand, because that\u2019s the side I lie on to sleep. Something about habit being a kind of promise. Something about promises being the only magic that matters. I never know if that\u2019s mine or Abuela\u2019s or a book I left open in high school and never finished. I talk again, this time to the water because that is who I am\u2014a witch from San Diego, the kind that still carries quarters for the trolley, who doesn\u2019t have a cat because the last cat knew too much and it made her a little uneasy, who keeps an old T-shirt in the trunk of her car for when the winter storms slap you and you give in and go, and then have to stop shaking before you can drive home. That kind.\n\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d I tell the water. \u201cPlease not yet.\u201d\n\nThe gull opens his beak like he\u2019s laughing.\n\nA wave shoulders another wave and they break together, slopping right into my circle. The coin blinks, lifts like an eye, and is gone. It happens so fast that I don\u2019t even gasp. I just sit there with salt in my lap while the water moves back like a cat who doesn\u2019t want to admit it cares.\n\n\u201cTake it, take it, everybody eats,\u201d I say, and my laugh feels hollow. Across the street there is a coffee shop already open, bleary lights and a handful of old men holding paper cups like they\u2019re candles in a vigil. There\u2019s a woman jogging by with a dog that looks like a piece of licorice. The pier groans. I press my palms into the cold sand and try to listen deeper than the morning\u2014under the combers, under the ratchety noise of the lifeguard truck, under the thing that woke me in the first place, the anxious little needle of it. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s inside me or above me. I just know it\u2019s here.\n\n\u201cSol!\u201d someone calls, not too close. I look back over my shoulder, pushing hair out of my mouth, and Jude is there, in a hooded sweatshirt that says Sea Dragon, which is the coffee shop he both works at and constantly threatens to quit. He\u2019s holding two cups, the tops haloed with steam, and one of his shoes is untied. He waves the coffee like a flag. \u201cAre you summoning or sulking?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t yell the S-words. You\u2019ll bring cops,\u201d I say, standing, brushing salt off my knees. The gull has hopped into the circle and is stabbing at the line with his beak. \u201cYou\u2019re too on the nose,\u201d I tell him, and he blinks.\n\nJude shuffles down the short slope of sand, his hair still stuck in sleep spirals. He has the prettiest eyelashes of anyone I know. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asks, which is our oldest joke and our most serious question.\n\nI take the cup. \u201cOkay-ish. The ocean took my coin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt always will,\u201d he says, kicking at a lump of sand like he can bully it into being something else. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with the kelp beds?\u201d he adds, then looks guilty, because he\u2019s the reason I\u2019m fixating. His face is a map of his thoughts and you can see the routes he takes to dodge something.\n\n\u201cYou tell me,\u201d I say. \u201cYou saw them.\u201d\n\nHe nods, a quick flick. \u201cThey look like they\u2019ve been dissolved by\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Lemon. Or spit.\u201d He snorts at himself. \u201cI\u2019m a poet. Anyway, it\u2019s weird. I know weird in the water.\u201d He glances at my half circle and the gull, who has gotten his beak stuck in the salt line in a way that makes me think a lot of things I can\u2019t say out loud without making them real. \u201cStop doing that with your face,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re folding in half.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always say that like it\u2019s helpful,\u201d I mutter, and we drink our coffee and watch the long heave of the ocean. \u201cAbuela\u2019s card jumped out like a frog,\u201d I say after a minute. \u201cThe Tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cYikes. Maybe she sneezed.\u201d His eyes are on the pier. \u201cTheo says they\u2019re going to close it again if the storm takes two more boards. He says they always say that but this time he believes them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pier never closes,\u201d I say, hoarding my superstition.\n\n\u201cEverything closes eventually. My mom\u2019s going to move to Yuma.\u201d We both consider the desolation of that. We look at the gull again, because it's easier than looking at each other when catastrophe sneaks so close to regular news. \u201cYou want me to pretend I didn\u2019t call you? And you can pretend you slept until your alarm and didn\u2019t sneak out to do\u2026 that?\u201d He gestures at the circle.\n\n\u201cI want you to pretend you're psychic and tell me the thing I won\u2019t listen to anyway,\u201d I say. He puts his hand over his heart like I stabbed him. Then he leans into me for a second, shoulder to shoulder, warm.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re destined for something stupid and enormous,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have the nose for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have the my-mother\u2019s-nose for it,\u201d I grumble. And I do. It\u2019s this particular slope, this way of smelling rain before San Diego remembers how to do it. Marion Vega had that nose and her dimple and the habit of tapping her teeth when she thought. She died when I was fifteen in a car that wasn\u2019t ours, with a man we didn\u2019t know. That\u2019s the clean version. The other versions multiply like ants in summer; you shut a door and find them in your sugar anyway. It\u2019s easier to say: she went west one day and never really came back. So I keep her nose and I keep the things that rhyme with it. Superstitions. Lists. Salt.\n\nWe walk back up to the street. The light is a better color now, less bruised. In the shop window, a man is kissing a baby on its ridiculous cap while a woman watches him like he invented that day. Jude doesn\u2019t tie his shoe. He never trips, which is one of his many wrong magics.\n\n\u201cYou coming by after shift?\u201d he asks. \u201cI\u2019m making cinnamon rolls or something that wants to be cinnamon rolls.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have to work at the shop. Abuela says there\u2019s a woman coming in for a smoke bundle and she wants me to make the kind with the rosemary and the scruffy sage. The scratchy one.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe could do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants me to practice my\u2014\u201d I wave a hand. The whole of the word \u201cdiscipline\u201d is too big for this morning. \u201cAnd she said the woman is strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrange like cheap? Or strange like how? Like she asks for too many things to be free? Or like she collects teeth? Which is a thing, Sol, I swear.\u201d\n\nI unthinkingly put my fingers to my wrist where my bracelets tap. \u201cStrange like, she smells like cheese.\u201d\n\nJude laughs. It\u2019s loud, and that\u2019s nice, and the gull flaps up spooked, drops a bead of salt like a snowflake. \u201cOkay. This town really is a salad,\u201d he says. \u201cI gotta go, I gotta open before Theo decides to downsize my beans again.\u201d He kisses the air near my ear because he is a gay grandpa in a twenty-six-year-old body and heads across the street, waving. Ray of light, noise in my pocket.\n\nI stay at the end of the sand for another minute and then I go wash my hands in the sink that never has hot water, wiping them on my jeans when the paper towels cling like jellyfish. On the walk back to the car, my coffee cools. A bus sighs by with only one person on it. On the windshield someone has drawn a mustache on the surfer decal and it suits him. When I turn the key, the car coughs like I\u2019ve woken it rudely. I always feel like I\u2019m about to drive away in a dream when I pull out of that lot, like the lines of the asphalt will move under me, like years ago when Jude rode a skateboard holding onto the back bumper and I was sure he\u2019d become a kite.\n\nBarrio Logan is still busy even in the morning\u2014the trickle of tortilla smoke, the paint that never dries on that one wall where kids climb up each other\u2019s bodies to write their names higher and higher. Our shop is tucked into a little strip with a pawn shop on one side and a hair place on the other. There\u2019s a mural of a woman with six hands over our door. Her palms are painted with eyes and lemons. When I was a kid I used to pretend they blinked. Abuela says her cousin did the mural and didn\u2019t follow the sketch, and that the eyes were not originally part of the plan. This is how things happen to us. We plan with one hand, and the other gets possessed by whatever is louder.\n\nLa Sirena Luminosa has always smelled like dryer sheets and salt with a little undernote of lavender that Abuela swears she hates, but she keeps adding to the jars because \u201ccustomers like that scent,\u201d she says, making it sound like an accusation. I have a ladder of dried oranges and a rack of candles in the shapes of things people like to petition: house, heart, palm. I put my bag under the counter and press the funny button on the register that sticks and see what comes up from the stack of paper I crammed under it yesterday. A receipt from the taco truck. A photo of me and Lina with our faces smushed together in the bathroom mirror at after prom. A napkin with a smear of butter. I stick the napkin back down and the photo in my pocket. I click my tongue quietly the number of times my mother used to; a static in the air answers me, like cling wrap.\n\n\u201cClose the door all the way,\u201d Abuela calls from the back room. \u201cIt\u2019s early, and there are flies already. The world is mostly flies.\u201d\n\nI do. \u201cThere\u2019s a woman coming,\u201d I say because I like the sound of making a story before it happens.\n\n\u201cThere are two women coming,\u201d Abuela says. I can hear her bracelets sliding up her arm as she moves. The back room has rugs and a big jar of coins and it\u2019s always too warm. She comes out like she always does\u2014like there\u2019s a song she can hear that she hopes will stop when she opens the next door. She has a towel on her shoulder like she\u2019s a bartender. \u201cI like your shirt,\u201d she says, which is one way she says she loves me. And: \u201cThis morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe water took the coin. Jude says the kelp looks chewed.\u201d\n\nAbuela\u2019s mouth clicks open and closed. Her hair is pinned up with three brown bobby pins that all point different ways. There\u2019s a smear of flour or ash on her temple. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give what you need to the water,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will only learn your taste.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what that means,\u201d I say, which is true at least half the time she talks.\n\n\u201cIt means be stingy. with yourself.\u201d She taps my chin, breathes. \u201cThe woman who smells like cheese,\u201d she adds, turning to the shelf with the rosemary and the scuffed sage. \u201cI do not know her. I do not think I have known her, but she looks like one I have met already. It\u2019s possible she smells like the truth. That can be sour, too.\u201d She hands me a bundle. \u201cMake this one tight. She will pull at anything loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can handle difficult customers,\u201d I say, puffing up, and drop the bundle and have to crouch to catch it.\n\n\u201cYou can. Yes,\u201d she says in a way that makes the yes mean three other things. \u201cAlso Jude called me to tell me he loves you and he should be the one to marry you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gay,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cPlease. Since when is that the only thing people are?\u201d\n\nWe laugh, and then the door opens on a chime that is not ours. It is sharper, a little higher, like a glass throat. The smell slides in first, careful and insistent, like a poem. My nose tells my head the story before my eyes can catch up. It\u2019s sharp as the rind of something hard and aged; it's soft as a stinky stripe unwrapped at a picnic; there\u2019s a sweetness like hay and the whisper of mold\u2014blue and brave. It makes my tongue waxy. It\u2019s so unusual in a place that always smells like rosemary and stubborn women that my shoulders lift without me asking them to.\n\nShe\u2019s wearing a yellow dress, a true yellow, not butter not mustard, not the color of eggs, a color I can\u2019t name because it keeps changing as she steps through the doorway. She has hair that does what it wants and a face I want to rearrange the features of in my mind\u2014like, the nose is smaller than I first thought, the mouth larger, the eyes a very soft brown until there\u2019s light in them and then they are the color of amber so old a mosquito might be frozen in it. Her mouth has the kind of lipstick you don\u2019t see unless you\u2019re wearing it or kissing it. She carries a tote with a wedge printed on it, BASTA! CHEESE in a font that feels like it\u2019s about to yodel.\n\n\u201cBuenos d\u00edas,\u201d she says, pronouncing it right and wrong at once, like someone who learned to say things late, who will never not be slightly amazed by a word on her tongue. She smiles. She does not show teeth. \u201cYou must be Marisol.\u201d\n\nMy body calls me by my name in response, like the way you stand up when a teacher looks at you. \u201cHi,\u201d I say, flicking rosemary dust off my fingers onto my jeans. \u201cThat\u2019s me. Can I\u2014?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one at the pier. That\u2019s what they say,\u201d she says, and I must look startled enough that she laughs. It has a small echo in it. \u201cNo one told me their secrets, don\u2019t worry. You smell like the kind of girl who doesn\u2019t sleep right.\u201d\n\nAbuela makes the sound she makes when she\u2019s found a burr in the couch. \u201cCan we help you?\u201d she asks, a little too bright.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking for a bundle,\u201d the woman says, bringing her palms together like prayer and pressing them to her nose briefly as if she might fall asleep if she doesn\u2019t. \u201cSomething with rosemary and, mmm, neighborhood sage. Not precious sage. More like a little rude. I\u2019m Mireya. Mireya Moho.\u201d The last name, I feel like she placed it on the counter like a piece of fruit she wants me to cut.\n\n\u201cMoho,\u201d I say automatically. \u201cMold.\u201d It slips out, and she tilts her head. Her skin smells like something that grew alone in a cave and wanted to be loved anyway.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take it personally,\u201d she says. \u201cI take it chemically.\u201d She grins, showing a tooth that is turned just slightly sideways, like a girl waiting to run. \u201cI make cheeses. I think you know this. I have a table at the Little Italy Saturday market. You should come by. We all grow something.\u201d Her eyes flick to the candles\u2014heart, house, palm\u2014and back. \u201cI\u2019m new to this neighborhood. I like to pay my respects quickly. The winds are wrong lately. Have you noticed?\u201d\n\nAbuela\u2019s bracelets talk to each other as she moves. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed all kinds of things. We\u2019re busy. Do you want the bundle or do you want to talk to my granddaughter all day? Because she likes to talk, and you won\u2019t leave alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not in a hurry. I\u2019m always arriving and leaving at once,\u201d she says lightly. \u201cBundles are good. But also, I think I\u2019ll buy\u2014\u201d She leans in toward a shelf and inhales. She doesn\u2019t touch. She\u2019s elegant about not touching. \u201c\u2014this oil. And that candle that looks like a hand. The one with the chipped knuckle. It feels honest.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m wrapping the bundle tighter than anybody deserves to wrap a bundle, my fingers doing that machine rhythm they do when I\u2019m trying not to shake. The smell of her is not loud, but it\u2019s thorough; it follows any space that opens. \u201cDo you know Jude?\u201d I ask, because I am rude sometimes, because I am trying to make her ordinary.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows Jude,\u201d she says, smiling into her hand, then into the strap of her tote, then up at me through her hair like it\u2019s a whole new person. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know him. Not the way you do. Yet.\u201d She puts a thin roll of cash on the counter and a small square wrapped in wax paper on top of it. \u201cA gift. From me to you. A little Parmesan to make your coffee into a soup.\u201d She laughs at my expression. \u201cPeople fear what is rude on the tongue.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople also fear presents,\u201d Abuela murmurs.\n\nMireya lifts one shoulder. My body wants to take a step back and a step closer at once. Sometimes I think this city keeps people who don\u2019t belong anywhere else and makes us feel like the same-sized wrong thing\u2014like we could line up and make a bridge out of us.\n\n\u201cYou did not answer my question,\u201d she says softly. \u201cHave you noticed the winds?\u201d No one who is from here asks about wind in the plural like that. The Santa Ana likes to come by herself.\n\n\u201cThe pier\u2019s talking,\u201d I say before I can stop myself. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a\u2026 tremble. Like the freeway when everyone is smiling at the same time.\u201d I dig in my mouth with my tongue to find a word I dropped. \u201cLike the shore is reciting something. A first line.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight. The winds are moving backwards,\u201d she says, and her face doesn\u2019t move much when she says that. \u201cEverything is going to smell like something else for a while.\u201d\n\nShe pays. She lifts the bundle, almost reverent. She does not wink. She does not do anything that twitchy women do to make you love them. She simply exists like a thing that\u2019s had time to realize it has the right to be in its own body. When she leaves, her dress bellies out a little, like it has a weather pattern of its own. The smell of her stays. I can feel it on my wrists, in the little pocket of air between my top lip and my teeth. It\u2019s not unpleasant. It\u2019s just definite. It\u2019s like learning a word so well that your mouth knows it without you. Abuela rubs the counter with her towel like she\u2019s wiping off fingerprints.\n\n\u201cDo you know her?\u201d I ask, and she gives me the face she makes when she\u2019s about to lie or tell a story instead of an answer.\n\n\u201cThere are only fourteen women in the world and they take turns being everyone,\u201d she says. \u201cYes? No? She smells like the old churches we used to go to when we were pretending to be other things. Those candles that burn crooked. She smells like the way rot helps us grow. Teaches us to let go or we will be eaten alive. And also like the rich people\u2019s picnic.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a witch,\u201d I say, because it is easier to label than to untangle all of the little strings. \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 like me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not like you. She\u2019s like a rock in a place where rocks will eventually be sand,\u201d Abuela says. \u201cBe careful. Do not be rude. Did she leave a thing for you?\u201d\n\nI pull the wax paper parcel toward me, sniff it, and then I laugh because of course I do. \u201cIt\u2019s cheese,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always cheese when she leaves,\u201d Abuela says, like we have discussed this before. I almost say that\u2014like we have discussed this before\u2014but I swallow it, because sometimes the feeling of that trick is the way dreams bleed into a day. She looks down at the cash. She looks at me. Her mouth is a pen cap that someone chewed. \u201cDo not eat it,\u201d she says, and I nod, and I put it under the register on top of the napkin, on top of that butter smear I can feel with my fingers even after I wash my hands.\n\nThe rest of the morning is slow and then briefly silly. A man comes in and buys a candle shaped like a tiny baby and tells me he wants to stop his neighbor from drumming because he has a migraine and a baby would surely help with that, and he stares me down when I try to explain that the candles aren\u2019t dolls. A woman buys a book because it has a gold snake on the cover and then tells me she doesn\u2019t read but loves plots. A group of teenagers come in and smell everything. A girl with a scab on her lip says, \u201cDoes this have\u2026 will this help?\u201d and she doesn\u2019t show me what this is, just looks past me at the shelf with the oils like it is a museum of answers. I want to hand her my own front door and say, knock whenever you need to. I sell her the cheap things that actually work and I tell her to put honey under her tongue and then bite down. She looks at me like I stole something. She looks at me like I gave her something. We make change. This is also magic.\n\nAt two I take my break and sit on the back steps and eat the tortilla roll-ups Abuela makes me when she remembers. There\u2019s a cat back there that belongs to nobody and all of us. It looks at me with that disdain that is actually a long love. I can hear the trolley thrum and the little clack of the neighbor\u2019s wind chimes. When a gust hits that shouldn\u2019t exist, hot as a breath from a person who has just told a lie, it presses against my skin like a warning. I think of Mireya saying winds in the plural. I think of The Tower card, that click of many things about to be one thing. I think of how easy it is to start talking to yourself without your mouth moving. I nap with my eyes open for a minute and see my mother\u2019s hands sorting buttons. I wake up with the taste of copper in my throat. The cat is making biscuits on my thigh and I have to peel him off gently even though I\u2019d like to be kneaded.\n\nAt four we are papered in light. The kind of light that feels like a polite hand on the back telling you to hurry up or the bus leaves. My phone buzzes. Jude: Come by. I made the cinnamon rolls into something else. I tell Abuela I\u2019m running out. She watches me like the street might eat me this time, not later.\n\nSea Dragon smells like burnt sugar and tired college students. There\u2019s a new kid working who gives change with both hands like he learned that at church. Jude is slicing something gooey and proud, a pan of sticky squares that could be rolls or could be a mistake. He bows when I walk in. He is a host in a house that is actually a ship.\n\n\u201cI met her,\u201d I say. \u201cMireya Moho. She smells like a picnic you forgot in the sun. In a good way,\u201d I add, mouth full, because the cinnamon whatevers are ridiculous, buttery, the kind of sweet that makes your mouth not know what to do with talk for a second.\n\n\u201cI knew you would,\u201d he says, bobbing his head like a pigeon. \u201cShe came by yesterday. Asked me if the air conditioning is a spell. I told her yes. Isn\u2019t it? She\u2019s the one I told you about with the cheeses. There was a cloud of bees around her table at the market last week like a halo.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe left me a piece of Parmesan,\u201d I say. \u201cWhich feels like sending someone a photograph of your mother. It feels\u2026 intimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is intimate to you. I\u2019m jealous. Tell me about her dress. Tell me about the way she said her name.\u201d\n\nI tell him. We arrange and rearrange the details like dominoes, making patterns that could be anything until they aren\u2019t. He puts a square in a paper boat and hands it to a kid with a skateboard without making him pay. \u201cDonation to the youth,\u201d he says. The kid says, \u201cK,\u201d which is a blessing in a language I do not have. We talk about the wind. The air inside feels like it is still deciding whether to be cool or hot. If I close my eyes, I can hear the waves behind the noise of the espresso machine. I wonder if the ocean is doing that thing where, after a long day, it forgets to hold itself up and just lies there briefly and thinks of nothing.\n\nAt six, when the light has gone to that tin color that makes you a little sad, I walk down India Street to the end where the market packs itself up into pickup trucks. There\u2019s always someone still selling something out of a cooler, too tired to make change with their mouth. The grocer with the peaches that bruise themselves with arrogance is like a king. His name is Salvador. He kisses me on both cheeks and says, \u201cGirl, your hair.\u201d Maybe it looks like a storm that doesn\u2019t want to come. I buy grapes the size of thumbs. I find Mireya\u2019s table because I can smell it before I see it, even in this crowd, even in this soup. She has wheels and wedges and a pale gray goat cheese the color of some polite disappointment. There are children tying themselves into knots under the tablecloth and a woman in a hat who keeps trying to make the words \u201cSharp as my husband\u201d into a joke.\n\n\u201cYou came,\u201d Mireya says without looking up at first. Her fingers are a choreography with the knife, the paper, the scale. She wipes between cuts with a cloth she\u2019s tied around her wrist like a handkerchief waiting for a fever. \u201cI thought you would.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you thought I would,\u201d I say because I have never been smooth in my life. \u201cI brought no money with me on purpose.\u201d Jude is in my ear telling me not to flirt with girls who are not looking at me exactly the way I want them to. I wipe my palms on my skirt and try to look like a passerby. It\u2019s like pretending not to look at your own shadow.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. We barter,\u201d she says, slicing me a piece of something that is the exact color of the wall in my grandparents\u2019 hallway. It smells like a barn and caramel and tears. \u201cTell me the news and I\u2019ll give you something that will force your mouth to make a face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wind,\u201d I say, because I am a joke of a woman. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s going backwards.\u201d\n\nShe tilts her head. The knife waits. \u201cI already told you that. Unless I didn\u2019t. Unless I told you with my face.\u201d She glances up at the sky like it owes her a favor. \u201cThe bees in my boxes were nervous this morning. They danced funny\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always dance,\u201d a customer interjects.\n\n\u201cEverything dances,\u201d Mireya says. \u201cBut it was different. Worry is a rhythm, too. I can hear it from the way you breathe,\u201d she says to me, suddenly, walking her eyes across my face, slow, like her pupils are spell pieces. \u201cWhen do you sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the wrong time,\u201d I answer, and it feels like a confession and a lie. \u201cWhen do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen there is nothing else to do,\u201d she says, like she has never run out of anything else to do. \u201cTaste.\u201d\n\nThe cheese is rude and wonderful on my tongue, like a person who meets your mother and makes her cry with laughter. It fills my mouth with something like a word I can\u2019t remember. I close my eyes because I always do too much when I am trying not to do too little. When I open them, Mireya is watching my jaw move like she can read it. She hands a tiny wedge to a woman with a stroller and wraps two more in paper for a man with a mustache as if each piece is a story she is sending them home with, a thing that could undo them or teach them to say a different name when they wake up.\n\nShe gives me a piece of something softer. It sticks to the roof of my mouth. \u201cI have a question,\u201d she says, as if we are already in the middle of the remain of a game.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I say, because I am always waiting for a question.\n\n\u201cDo you want to save the world?\u201d she asks, as if she is asking if I want more water. As if she is asking whether I prefer goats or cows. \u201cWould you make that your job?\u201d\n\nBeside us, a man drops a crate. A child screams at the exact pitch of a dying pull toy. The wind lifts, then lies back down like a dog.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I say, because the truth is louder than my mouth. \u201cYes? I think. Sometimes. I don\u2019t also know what the world is. Or if it wants that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d she says simply. \u201cThis world does not want the saving you think it wants. It wants to be held while it does the things it will do anyway.\u201d She shrugs, like that\u2019s that. \u201cBut some of us are made to try, aren\u2019t we? Some of us are born with a hand that will not stay in our own pocket. Sometimes I smell that on people. Sometimes it stinks. Sometimes it\u2019s lovely.\u201d She taps the knife on the board, tap, tap. \u201cCareful. Everybody who saves something is also the one who opens the gate.\u201d\n\nI could ask her who taught her to say that. I could ask her what she wants from me besides the small power that comes from being the one holding the question. I could ask her where she learned to make a thing from warm milk that can be so sharp. I could ask her a thousand warm dumb things. Instead, I say, \u201cThere are seeds under our car again,\u201d because I\u2019ve plucked those little burrs off my socks three days in a row and I want to think it means something. I want to think everything is a letter addressed to me.\n\n\u201cEverything is,\u201d she says. \u201cYou might not be the right recipient. But the mailman doesn\u2019t know that. To him, every house is a house. You know?\u201d She smooths the paper. \u201cEat the gift. Or don\u2019t. But if you don\u2019t, do not throw it away. You shouldn\u2019t throw away a cow\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nAt home, night is late before it comes. I put the cheese in the bottom drawer like it\u2019s a sleeping mouse. I take a long shower and stand in it past the point where the hot goes out. My dreams start before I lie down. I can feel them crowding against the outside of my skull like people at a door. The first one is always water. The second one is my mother in her leather jacket at the stove with her hair doing that thing that used to make me think she had wings. I am small in that one, smaller than I ever was, because I keep wanting to go backwards and forwards at once. The third one is the pier, the boards a mouth, but the teeth are coins. I step inside. They don\u2019t bite.\n\nWhen I wake, my mouth is slick and my hands smell like rosemary, like I fell asleep at the shop. On the ceiling, the light from the street is making the shape of a ladder. It crawls up and up and ends in the corner where the paint peels. I reach up like a child and tap the air. I can feel the edge of something. You know the feeling. Like the way you can smell rain in other people\u2019s cities and know it is lonelier than yours. Like the breath you take right when someone is about to say your favorite part. Like the thumb pressing the dent in an apple and knowing it will bruise.\n\nI drive to the pier. This is stupid; I do it. The night has thinned out to that time when everyone who should be asleep is either crying or telling a cab driver their best story. I park crooked and no one slaps a ticket on me because the world is too busy doing its thing. There are\u2014no other way to put it\u2014coins glittering on the wet sand like someone cracked a slot machine. A black gull lands beside me and drops something. It is mean-looking, this gull, with a nick out of one wing like it lost a sentence in a fight. It cock eyes me and the thing between its feet shines wrong, pearly. I bend. It\u2019s a shell, but it has a face in it, or I think it does until I blink and it\u2019s just a thumbprint. The gull hops to the edge of the water and back like it\u2019s drawing me a map.\n\nThe tide is wrong. It is farther out than it should be, and then it creeps farther still. In a breath, it feels like if I take one step, I will fall over the edge of the world where it has unrolled itself and left a lip for us to look over. Behind me, someone hums. I turn because I am my mother\u2019s daughter and I don\u2019t believe in not looking at the thing that\u2019s behind you. There\u2019s nobody there. There is my car and the streetlight and the idea of someone who could have been leaning against the rail. The hum persists. It is inside my mouth. It is the hum my jaw makes before a cry.\n\n\u201cMarisol,\u201d says a voice I have already named even before I hear it, even before it is itself. It is the voice of a radio two cars back and a voice in my grandmother\u2019s kitchen and a voice at the market that knows what it is selling and a voice under the water that wants me to put my face in.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t sneak up on a witch,\u201d I say, and my breath ghosts the word. It\u2019s a stupid thing to say. It\u2019s a thing someone would say when they want to sound like they own something. The coins on the sand shift like fish.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d she says, and she smells like caves and picnics, sweet rot that makes your knees useful. \u201cI just arrived at the same time you remembered I was coming.\u201d Mireya stands next to me like that\u2019s where she has always stood. She doesn\u2019t touch me. She has two rings on her right hand and they look very dull in this light. \u201cCareful,\u201d she says, as if the shore is a knife. \u201cYou will fall off the world if you think it stops.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what I am doing,\u201d I say, because I always do until I don\u2019t. She hums.\n\n\u201cThe world will let you save it if it can make use of the story that grows after,\u201d she says. \u201cBe sure you like stories. People will tell yours wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you here to sell me something?\u201d I ask, and we laugh, and the gull barks at us like a puppy.\n\n\u201cNo. I am here because the water is rude tonight. I am here because I cannot not be. I am here because it is time to ask you to come with me tomorrow to a thing that is not your business and will become your business if you stand next to it too long.\u201d She says it with the careless carefulness of the kind of person who knows the cost and is willing to throw it in.\n\n\u201cWhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere the river used to be,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere we pretend the canyons were always small.\u201d\n\nI am not a hero. I am a girl who never learned to sleep right. I am a witch whose grandmother keeps the electric bill taped under the saints. I am a person who can hear a wave talk about itself and pretend it\u2019s me. I say yes without thinking again, because it is a habit, the easiest one. Saying yes and wanting later to read the contract twice.\n\nThe world breathes a way I do not know how to describe. The coins on the sand settle. The gull shifts one foot to the other. The pier creaks an old man sound. We stand there with our arms intact and our hearts doing their work, which is to beat and to remember too much. A train howls all the way over by the tracks. A wind goes by hot as a dryer. The night sits on us for a second like a cat that has decided we will do.\n\nAt home I forget my shoes on. I am too tired to undo my braids and fall asleep with them pulling on my scalp and dream I am being stitched to the sky. My hands lift above me and I am sure I can see the seam. I am sure I can pluck it and open the bloom. I am sure the bloom is the color of a lemon that has grown in a shade. When I wake to the sound of someone knocking at the door, there is a moment where my body is not mine. It is a borrowed thing. It is a rented room. I ask the door who it is out the side of my mouth, and it says, in Abuela\u2019s voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t answer, you are already lost.\u201d\n\nI open. There is no one there. There is the wind, bringing with it a little smell like the first slice into a wheel. There is the sound of the trolley going by, the lights making my hallway into a candy cane. There is the sheaf of paper under my doormat\u2014flyers, coupons, a note in a hand I think I should know. My heart does a crunch. I bend, pick up the note, and it says, in blue pen, in tiny script that looks like it wants to be a field but keeps being a fence: you are late.\n\nFor what. I want to ask, but I know my mouth will make the wrong shape if I try. The kitchen smells like rosemary and the ghost of something long-steeped. I open the bottom drawer and unpeel the wax paper very carefully, like skin. It isn\u2019t cheese. Not anymore. It is a little square of salt, compacted, so white that the kitchen light makes my eyes water. It is scored with hairline cracks that look like dry riverbeds. When I put my finger to the surface, thinking idiotically that I can smooth it, the tiny valley under my nail fills with a tiny hurt and I taste a very old word.\n\nI\u2019m not going to eat it, I tell myself. Then my phone says 4:11 AM like that matters, like the numbers are a code I am supposed to know. I put the salt square on the counter. I put my hand over it like a makeshift altar, like this is an alarm I can muffle. Outside, a gull laughs. Or it doesn\u2019t. My building shifts like it is remembering a different city it wanted to be. I breathe in the warmth left in the room by whatever happened before I arrived at it. I stand for so long that my calves begin to throb. I am not moving, and everything is.\n\nThe note lies on the table. The letters look like a row of teeth. The wind worries at the edge of it, lifts it, puts it down. The scent of something fermented floats to the top of the room, then the bottom, like a ghost learning to climb stairs.\n\nSleep finds me standing there. Or I find sleep like you find a coin in the sand where you knew you would, where someone must have dropped it, someone exactly like you.",

The light is already too clean when I realize I\u2019m sitting on the kitchen floor with my back against the cabinet, my cheek pressed to the lip of the counter like I\u2019m a kid listening for a pulse. My jaw clicks when I yawn. The square of salt on the counter has pulled a halo of damp out of the air and made a wet asterisk on the wood. My phone wobbles on the edge of the sink, buzzing like a bee that got inside and can\u2019t remember how to leave. I stand so fast that my knees argue, then grab for the note, the salt, my keys, the wrong jacket, the right jacket, my bracelets, the thought of breakfast, the idea of water. The note\u2014blue pen, fence letters\u2014lives in my pocket like a square animal. I hold my breath while I wrap the salt in wax paper, because it feels like it might crack if I exhale too hard, like old ice. It hums under my palm, or maybe that\u2019s my hand pretending to be useful.\n\nAbuela knocks once and lets herself in without waiting. She takes in the kitchen like a witness, her towel in one hand, her other hand already finding something to straighten that was not crooked until she touched it. She looks at the square under my hand, then at my face, then at the note in my pocket, which she can always see because pockets are for hiding and hiding is a noise. \u201cLate,\u201d she says, and it is not a question and not an accusation, just a weather report. \u201cYou dreamt on your feet again. You drooled. Look.\u201d She wipes the counter with the corner of the towel, shows me the shine, the little snail trail of my mouth, grinning like I am a child she has just caught pretending not to have eaten the frosting.\n\n\u201cI have to go,\u201d I say, because the words push on my teeth and will not be kept back. \u201cNow. To the river that is not a river. Will you\u2014can you\u2014\u201d I do not finish any of the three sentences I start because finishing is an art form I never chose to practice.\n\nShe looks pleased by something she does not tell me. \u201cBring a lemon,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd money, because sometimes money is the only lemon that works. And wear shoes like you lie in. Left side foot is the one you trust. Do not say you love anyone while you stand on concrete you did not pour. The words will stick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d I say, reflex and revenge and real.\n\n\u201cThen say it again on the carpet,\u201d she counters, stepping back until her heels are on the kitchen rug. \u201cThere. Now it is not borrowed. Come back before noon because I promised your Uncle Tavo you would fix his phone and he will not believe me if I say the wind took you. Eat something that has already decided to be alive. Put the salt away. Don\u2019t bring it where the river used to be. It will make the old women cranky.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt came as a present,\u201d I say, feeling defensive of a mineral, which is not new behavior for me.\n\n\u201cSo did you,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we don\u2019t bring you everywhere. Not to weddings. Not to court.\u201d She kisses my forehead like she\u2019s telling my skull a secret. \u201cFind your door,\u201d she adds, because she has to, because it is the piece she cannot stop herself from saying, like a rosary bead that itches if it is not touched.\n\nI leave the salt under the dish rack like a pet I am not ready to admit to. I put a lemon in my bag and the copper coin that is no longer under the sand but also is, because the sea keeps two of everything and I keep the others in stories. My car coughs and agrees to be a car. The air has that pink smell of apartments making coffee and dogs being convinced to pee. I drive with the windows down even though it makes my hair a frantic animal because I want the wind to say whatever it is going to say without having to turn the volume up. The freeway is already a collection of people having a lot of feelings out loud. A man in a white truck is eating a burrito with the kind of intensity that suggests he is making a decision bigger than the burrito. A woman does the thing where she does not look before she moves over and I do the thing where I love her anyway, eventually.\n\n\u201cWhere the river used to be\u201d turns into ten different places when you try to name it. It could be the culvert that hums behind the stadium, the concrete bed that was poured so nobody had to think about flood anymore, the flat brown slice through Mission Valley where the malls set up like they are certain of their own permanence, the estuary at the lip of Dog Beach where everything comes to an argument and leaves in a compromise. I make the choice my nose tells me to make, which is to go to the place where the water still tries to remember itself, the wide shallow place where the dogs throw themselves joyfully into each other and the river meets the ocean and they pretend they like each other even when they don\u2019t.\n\nThe parking lot is already a circus, boards and boots and men without shirts returning from some proof of their own backbone. The wind is wrong. It\u2019s east at this hour and hot against my jaw, and it tastes like someone cut a lemon with a rusty knife. My stomach does the thing where it thinks we forgot something important, like a child in a play who suddenly suspects the line is never going to come. I find Mireya by not looking for her. She is on the low seawall, sitting like she sat there before people learned to wear shoes, her dress replaced by something navy that shows her collarbone like a lyric. There\u2019s a woven basket at her feet and a young guy with a bike asking her questions he thinks are charming because he doesn\u2019t hear how they sound when they come out of his mouth. She looks at him long enough to rearrange his face in her mind, then says something that makes him laugh and take his bike\u2019s sorry chain off and walk it away instead of riding. She looks at me like she is checking her watch.\n\n\u201cYou are late,\u201d she says, soft enough that it is not a greeting and not a slap, just a small plant being watered.\n\n\u201cApparently,\u201d I say, which is all the pride I can afford with the note in my pocket thrumming like a hummingbird. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me when to come. That\u2019s rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cI assumed you would know,\u201d she says, which is ruder, because it implies a faith in me I do not get to feel all the time. \u201cLook.\u201d She gestures at the brown river, braided with dogs and discarded tennis balls and children\u2019s knees.\n\nAt first it looks ordinary, the ordinary wrong of a made channel, a place where concrete tries to teach water a new language and water, being generous, pretends to learn it while secretly plotting a return to its first tongue. Then the wrong reveals itself like February moths in a cupboard. The river\u2019s surface is scabbed in places, thin plates of white that break and drift, not foam and not trash, a skin. A woman wading with a small dog stops and lifts the animal out with a yelp because the little dog\u2019s paws have collected an instant crust that breaks when she cradles it, like it has been dipped in a brittle sugar. The kid whose ball floated too far shrieks when he reaches for it and the water stings him. He shakes his hand like a paper cut. The river is salting its own mouth. It is doing it in delicate, quiet ways, like a deliberate person. It is not all at once. That is worse.\n\nMy tongue finds the word before my head does. \u201cBloom,\u201d I say, half to myself, and half to the part of the river that is in me and wants to be useful and knows it cannot be. \u201cNo, not bloom. That\u2019s when things multiply on purpose. This is\u2014what is this?\u201d I taste the air like bread dough. It has that warm sour creeping up it, the same smell the square in my kitchen had and didn\u2019t have. \u201cDo you smell it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a woman made of it,\u201d she says, but not with pride. \u201cThere is a salt in the air that is not from this water. There is a hand in the wrong place. The wind is carrying more than itself. Look up the valley.\u201d She points, and I see it because she wants me to: the far shimmer, the ghost of a cloud, except it\u2019s not a cloud, because it moves like it has weight. It\u2019s like when flour goes up in a kitchen in a cough and then decides it\u2019s a weather pattern.\n\nA ranger on a bike does slow circles like a gate keeper trying to find where the goats are getting through. He calls something to the woman with the dog that sounds like assurance and rules. An old man in a bucket hat shakes his head and tells his companion the river has been dying for a hundred years, that he can smell it in his knees. Two teenagers step to the very lip of the brown water and then step back like it hissed, as if it was a stove. The gulls are in committee on a light pole, discussing disaster. The committee has opinions. They always do.\n\n\u201cWhat did you bring?\u201d Mireya asks, and I hear underneath it: what will you do when I ask something you did not think to bring. I pull the lemon out like a punchline. I have never been good at pretending to be anything but what I am.\n\n\u201cYellow,\u201d she says approvingly, as if color is all she waited to see. \u201cCut it. But do not put it in the river. We are not blessing anything yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I ask, as if naming will make it smaller, or at least push it into a shape with a beginning and an end.\n\n\u201cWe are listening for the door,\u201d she says, because this is the city we live in and this is the summer we are having. \u201cAnd we are going to look at something nobody wants to look at, which is the part of the river we hid under the road because it made us nervous to hear it at night.\u201d She slides off the wall with the grace of someone who knows her ankles as if they were old pets. \u201cFollow. Don\u2019t step where I step. That is not a joke. We will both fall into the same mouth if we mirror each other.\u201d\n\nWe cut behind the bathroom building and along the back fence where the ice plant tries to pretend it\u2019s a civic solution to a problem. We walk under the shade that knows it is in a place shade doesn\u2019t last. She does not walk fast. She walks like a person measuring something in her bones. We hop a low chain like teenagers and neither of us gets caught, though my jacket wants my elbow more than I want my jacket. She takes us to the place, the mouth of the culvert, the round dark where the river turns its face away from us for a stretch. It is a concrete throat with graffiti in a script that flares like anger and hearts with initials inside that are both obvious and brave. The air coming out of the tunnel has a temperature that is not honest. It is cool like a body is cool, not like shade is cool. Something talks out of it. It uses the sound of drip, the language of bugs, the echo of tires from the road above, the distant metal of a shopping cart trying to be a boat.\n\nMireya sets her basket down and takes out nothing that makes sense for a cheese seller to carry, which is how I know I am not wrong about her. A small mirror with a crack, a twist of red thread, a little jar of something that looks like it might be honey and might be everyone\u2019s favorite lie. She puts the mirror against the curve of the opening so it looks like the tunnel has a pupil. I am not brave but I have learned how to set my feet so my fear has to wait in line. I cut the lemon and hold it like the answer to a question. Its smell is so particular that my mouth floods its own small ocean.\n\n\u201cPut that on your tongue,\u201d she instructs, and I obey, salt memory banging into acid memory like drums. \u201cNow tell me what you cannot see. Tell me the shape of the thing that wants to be seen and isn\u2019t allowed yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cNarrow,\u201d I say, because I can feel it in my throat suddenly, a tightness where song gets caught. \u201cCoiled. Polite. It doesn\u2019t want to alarm us. It wants us to call it something harmless. It wants to be the name of a flower. It is tired of being a tube.\u201d The lemon makes my eyes damp and the tunnel makes my ears ache and the river under concrete says I am not as big as I thought I was and that embarrasses me.\n\n\u201cOld pipes,\u201d Mireya says, as if she is remembering a childhood specialty. \u201cOld permissions. The right of way granted to a thing that was supposed to help and instead learned to rule. The bigger ones are down in the bigger valley. But every small mouth thinks it is the mouth when it first learns the word \u2018open.\u2019 We are not here to fight with a culvert. We are here to tell it where to go to find its mother.\u201d She ties the red thread around the cracked mirror like it is getting married. \u201cHold this. If you see anything you love, do not tell it that yet. Wait until it tells you its name first.\u201d\n\nThe air shifts. I feel it on my bare knee where my jeans are ripped like I am a person with a life and not a story. The wind comes in from behind us like a guest who brings their own drink. It goes into the tunnel like it owns the place. I am aware of my scalp in a way I do not like. I am aware of my tongue. The lemon is a sun in my mouth, burning polite holes in my certainty. A sound like a coin dropping runs along the concrete and the hair on my arms fusses.\n\nThere is a woman sitting against the inner curve just inside the dark, where my eyes aren\u2019t supposed to be able to resolve detail yet. I do not jump because jumping would be rude and also because she looks like a person I have always known to be in places like this even when I have never seen her before. She is middle-aged in the way of someone who has never been allowed to keep a birthday, her hair braided with bits of ribbon that are too clean to be accidental. She is wearing a sweatshirt that says a school\u2019s name that is not from here. She has a plastic bag tied around one shoe and the other foot bare. She is smoking a cigarette that is not lit, and she is humming a song that is older than the bridge we are under. She looks at me like a mirror, like I am in her lap and she is naming me in her head.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she says, and laughter blooms all over my skin because of course she says that, of course everyone is reading the same script today and none of us got to workshop it. \u201cYou brought the wrong thing.\u201d She nods toward the lemon like it is a hat with a feather exactly an inch too long.\n\n\u201cWhat was I supposed to bring?\u201d I ask, already knowing I will argue with her answer because this is how doors and I talk to each other.\n\n\u201cA certain penny,\u201d she says, and my stomach does that awful happy turn it does when meta catches up to magic and you realize you knew and did not know at once, which is the only way I can stand to live. \u201cDon\u2019t be mad. The ocean always brings it back if you ask nice. Or if you are rude with grace. Which you are.\u201d She looks beyond me at Mireya. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t bring her here without a hat,\u201d she adds, as if we are at a church picnic.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not your business,\u201d Mireya replies, mild as a salt lick. \u201cWhat do you need, t\u00eda? Tell me with your mouth or tell me with the coin that you do not have.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhite,\u201d the woman says, and I see her then because she wants me to. Her left eye has a little milk in it. Her bottom lip is split and keeps re-breaking. Her hands are too dry. She is the kind of person who knows every place the city left a hole and stepped into each one, becoming a stopgap, becoming the story other people tell about why they need to feel safe. She holds up a small square like she is an altar yourself. It is salt. It is like mine. It is not mine. It is flecked with something I do not like to think about. \u201cThey fell,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t know who dropped them. My girls won\u2019t step in the water now. Even the brave ones won\u2019t. It hurts like lemons, but old. I thought, ah, this is the thing I get to keep, you know? This is the gift from the place. But it\u2019s not. It cried. It cried all night. I had to wrap it in my T-shirt so it didn\u2019t have to hear itself.\u201d\n\nMireya puts her hand over her mouth in a gesture that is not hiding so much as translating. \u201cWhere,\u201d she says, and that word is a question I have heard Abuela ask a hundred times in a hundred kitchens. It means map and it means confession.\n\n\u201cThey used to put candles here,\u201d the woman says, pointing at a little lip of concrete that is blackened, little circles of ash like coins flattened by trains. \u201cFor their uncles and their cousins and their boys. They put pictures. They put beer. They put a teddy with one eye. I put a salt square on top of the teddy and it sang. It sang wrong. It sang like a pipe. So I took it off. It laughed at me.\u201d\n\nI kneel because I need to be nearer to her feet, to the way the dirt has climbed her ankle like a river learns a bank. \u201cI have one,\u201d I say, whisper-small, as if the tunnel is a classroom and we will be allowed to answer only if we are quiet. \u201cIn my kitchen. It came as something else. It changed after and it wrote me a letter.\u201d\n\nThe woman grins like I gave her a tooth. \u201cYou got a letter? They don\u2019t usually write. What did it say? \u2018You\u2019re late\u2019?\u201d Her grin turns into a cough that bends her in half like a priest. I put my hand out and she does not take it, not because she doesn\u2019t want help but because she has a rule about not taking help from girls she loves immediately.\n\n\u201cIt said I was late,\u201d I admit, and Mireya shakes her head with so much affection that it almost hurts in its generous hardness. She looks like someone is trying to teach her a joke in a language she learned by ear.\n\n\u201cGive me the lemon,\u201d Mireya says, and I do. She squeezes it onto the cracked mirror until a bead of juice runs across the glass like an impatient child and falls into the first inch of tunnel. The drop sizzles. It actually makes that sound. It smells like a pizzeria inside a church. She listens to the sound like it is telling her a story. She turns the mirror to the side and the crack lines up with the seam where the poured concrete meets the older concrete with a plate underneath it so the whole city would not fall into itself. \u201cThere,\u201d she says, not triumphant, just sure. \u201cThe pipe. They are pushing up through the skin. Something is asking to be let through and it\u2019s too salty to be here. They tunneled the desert to our kitchen. Someone built a straw across time.\u201d\n\n\u201cDesal,\u201d I say, and the word feels ridiculous and exact at once. \u201cDesalination. The plant at Carlsbad, the big one. They pull salt out and make sweet water and then they throw the brine back to the ocean like it is a relative we don\u2019t like, and the current takes that and sweeps it south and sometimes the wind is wrong and sometimes they are wrong and sometimes the river wants to say a thing back.\u201d\n\nMireya looks at me with a mouth that is on the verge of something. \u201cAnd sometimes somebody takes the wrong pipe and puts it into the wrong mouth because paperwork is magic too, mija. We could follow permits like breadcrumbs and still arrive at a wolf. Or we can tell it, not here. Not today.\u201d She kneels and puts her hand to the concrete like a doctor lays a palm on a chest. \u201cThis is the door. This is one of them. Can you hear her, se\u00f1orita? With the ribbons. Ask your girls to sing for me. Just that one song that is brown and ugly and somebody\u2019s grandmother danced to it and no one will admit it.\u201d\n\nThe woman nods and hums. It is not the same song as before. It is more tired and more cheerful and that combination always makes me want to cry immediately, like a thrift store. The sound finds the seam. The seam hears it like a dog hears its name. The mirror fogs over. The lemon squeezes itself further into the crack because it wants to be inside something for once. I feel the hair on my neck move with the wind that isn\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d the woman says, opening her eyes on me finally like she is introducing herself properly by asking me instead to be a person. \u201cYou smell like something that left and didn\u2019t leave.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Sol,\u201d I say, which is close to the truth most days, and I can hear Abuela correcting me, and I can hear my mother saying my middle name like a song, and I can hear the tide lying through its teeth. \u201cMy grandmother says I am thresholds. And this is Mireya. She is rot. In the good way,\u201d I add, and the woman laughs so hard on a breath that it turns to coughing again and we all wait for the cough to finish because it is part of the ritual.\n\n\u201cDoors,\u201d Mireya says when we are quiet. \u201cIf you open, it will walk. If it walks, it will tell the others. If it tells the others, they will try too. If they try, they will fail in different places. We will be busy for a long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let it walk here if it wants,\u201d the woman says, and she is not unkind. \u201cThis is the place that always gets everyone\u2019s footsteps anyway. It\u2019s already bruised. Give it to me. Give it to the girls. We will teach it to dance wrong so it forgets what it came for.\u201d\n\nI do not know if the world can hear that. I do know that the concrete under my knee hums like a grandmother trying not to laugh. I do know that the lemon smell is suddenly both delicious and unbearable. I do know that I can feel the coin under the water like an eye closing and opening. I take the mirror and hold it like I was told, the crack lined with the seam. I say nothing I love out loud. I wait.\n\nThe wind turns around mid-step like a person who remembers they left the stove on. It goes out instead of in. The tunnel breathes. Something gives that was pretending not to be held. The sound is small. It is the click of an old light switch. It is a knuckle being cracked discreetly in church. The skin of white on the river surface trembles and begins to move, little plates unceremoniously breaking and drifting toward the mouth where the dogs are deciding to bark at it or ignore it depending on their breed. The boy with the ball yells \u201cSick!\u201d like it is a compliment. The ranger stops circling. The gulls discuss the change in management. The woman leans her head back against the curve and closes her eyes like the tunnel just pressed a cool spoon to her brow.\n\n\u201cDo not throw away a cow\u2019s work,\u201d Mireya says under her breath, and I fight the urge to say I told you, as if I told anyone anything. She pulls a small jar of something dark from her basket and places it by the blackened lip where the candles used to be. She unscrews it and the smell that comes out is honey, yes, but also dead flowers and beer and the sticky edge of love. \u201cFor the girls,\u201d she adds, and the woman makes a face like she will not cry today if it kills us.\n\nWe sit on the low wall when we are done being in the mouth and pretend for a minute that we are pair of normal women with nothing to do but eat fruit and make jokes about joggers. Mireya breaks the rest of the lemon with her hands and smears it on her wrist, breathing there like the answer lives in her veins. I think about the salt square on my kitchen counter and whether it will have become something else by the time I get home, whether it will have written another note in a hand I can almost remember. I think about the gull with the nicked wing, whether birds hold grudges. I think about organs, how they never stop and then they stop, how the city is an organ we keep trying to pretend is in our own body.\n\n\u201cIt will happen again,\u201d Mireya says, not warning, not gloating. She rubs the pith into the pad of her thumb like a worry stone. \u201cThe pipe is not the thing. The thing is the permission. The piece of paper that says Yes, in all caps. The men who hold that paper are asleep in a way that makes them dangerous. We need to wake them or we need to move the bed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo we?\u201d I ask, because sometimes questions are a way to buy time in a store where time is too expensive.\n\nShe tilts her head. Her hair catches the light and throws it away again. \u201cYou are the one with a grandmother who knows the names of small doors. You tell me. Do we wake them or do we move the bed?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to say both,\u201d I admit. \u201cI want to say, yes. I want to say I can do this without breaking anything I can\u2019t fix. I want to say I am not the Tower. I want to be something that looks nothing like the Tower.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very beautiful when you are deciding something that is going to hurt,\u201d she says, which is both an insult and a magic trick. \u201cAsk your Abuela how to say no to the thing that wants to be saved. It is harder. It is my least favorite part of the job.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is your job?\u201d I ask, because I am beyond not asking that particular question any longer.\n\nShe shrugs one shoulder, as if she is trying on one version of herself and finding the sleeve too long. \u201cI help things rot the way they were meant to. I make sure the wind doesn\u2019t take something that promised to stay. I kiss the milk and the milk decides to live another life. I ask bees not to tell me secrets I am not ready to keep. I tell women like you what time it is and then I sit across from them while they decide to break their clocks.\u201d She picks up a little square of the river\u2019s shed skin with the edge of the mirror and doesn\u2019t touch it. \u201cAnd sometimes I go to the market and let rich people be brave in the small way of putting something rude on their tongues. Everybody eats,\u201d she adds, looking at me like I said that first.\n\n\u201cJude will make a song out of that if you give him a pen,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd if you say my face is beautiful again when I am about to do something stupid, he will steal you and tell you all his worst ideas. I won\u2019t save you from that. He is my favorite bully.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not need saving,\u201d she says, and she smiles at me without teeth. \u201cBut I do like to be told no. Practicing consent is a game we can make holy.\u201d She stands, smooths her dress, re-ties the basket handle like it matters how it rests on her palm. \u201cCome to my table at the market Saturday. Bring your coin if the ocean gives it back. Bring the salt if you have lost the coin. If you bring neither, bring your mouth. I will give you something that will remind you of the desert and of your mother. You will hate me a little. That will be useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate easily,\u201d I say, and she lifts an eyebrow in the exact way a door does when it is not sure yet if it will open.\n\n\u201cEveryone hates easily,\u201d she contradicts gently. \u201cWe are just very good at not telling the truth about it. That is all. Tell Jude I said he has very good wrists.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will be the end of me,\u201d I say, because if Jude\u2019s wrists enter the chat we will be here all day. She breaks into laughter that sounds like a spoon clinking against glass and I love her suddenly for a full second enough to be frightened by it. My mother loved like that, all at once, and looked at the mess after like it was a mural she had commissioned without seeing the sketch.\n\nWe part like a tide parting from a shore that is not done with her. I stand and watch the river behave for a few breaths like a child trying to impress a teacher. The woman in the tunnel hums still, or maybe the tunnel hums and I have given it the credit. I text Jude because I need to hear his ridiculous keyboard clicks, and he writes back immediately like his phone is a lizard he wears around his neck. He says, bring me a story. He says, bring me your face. He says, I am learning to frost a cake that does not want to be frosted. He sends a picture of his hands covered in sugar like he murdered a snowman. He is the thing I bring to everything because he is always a door in the other direction.\n\nBack at La Sirena Luminosa, Abuela has rearranged the candle shelf in a way that looks random if you are new and like a chant if you are not. She does not look up when I come in, which is how she says I have not died. She continues to wind string around the fat belly of a jar like she is swaddling something that keeps trying to be born.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it,\u201d I tell her, but I am smiling because I want her to say it and then I can argue with her like a child and feel for two minutes like the world is nothing but light and chores.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she says dutifully, and I present my hands for inspection because I am a person who still wants to be graded on a curve. She turns them over, sniffing the lemon in my skin and the tunnel on my knuckles. She presses my thumb until the print shows blood a little. She nods. \u201cGood. You didn\u2019t put your love on the concrete. I can hear the lemon laughing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe river is salting up,\u201d I report, sliding the mirror onto the counter because there is nowhere else for it to be right now, because my pockets have become places I do not trust with glass and old songs. \u201cThe wind carried it wrong. Or right. Or both, if you ask someone who likes to watch small things suffer. We told it where to go. It went a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will come back a lot,\u201d she says, as if I did not expect that. \u201cSalt is the part of the story that writes itself. Did Mireya kiss anything that does not belong to her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe kissed her wrist,\u201d I say, which is partly mischief and partly trying to share the awe. \u201cShe is a door that thinks it\u2019s a window, Abuela. She makes me want to pull my own head off and look inside just to see how I\u2019m built.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is sex,\u201d Abuela says dryly, and I choke on a piece of air because she is not wrong and she will be merciless about it if I tell her she is right. \u201cBe careful. Mold does not belong to anyone. It will send a letter to the person who thinks they own it and sign it with a drawing of a goat. You will have to frame it.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe says everyone hates easily,\u201d I tell her, hanging my jacket on the hook where my jacket always falls off because this is how my life reminds me to pay attention in increments. \u201cShe says I\u2019m beautiful when I am deciding to be hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are,\u201d Abuela says, not even glancing up, and I try to pretend that is not a knife but I can feel its edge. \u201cHelp me with this string. Your Uncle will be obnoxious about the phone and then he will make us soup that is too salty and then we will fight and then we will kiss his head and tell him to go. The woman with the lip will come back and she will want a different oil with a snake on it. The world is going to tip and we will keep sweeping during the tipping because that is what we do. Don\u2019t bring that salt into my bedroom. It will make the saints snore.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wrote me a letter,\u201d I say again, because some things I have to say twice to believe they became sentences and not dreams. \u201cIt will write another. I can feel it deciding how to spell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d she says. \u201cIf a thing writes you, you can write back.\u201d\n\nThe afternoon is the color of a nap we will not get to take. People come in with their needs folded into their wallets, into their palms, into the flares of anger around their mouths. I make bundles with my left hand because habits are promises and promises are magic and we are doing tiny magic while the big magic adjusts its skirt and sits down hard somewhere nobody expected. I keep finding salt on my clothes where salt should not be. In the bathroom mirror, my face looks like it is about to say something I am not sure I want to hear. My phone pings with an unknown number that I do not answer because I am brave in exactly this one way.\n\nAfter closing, Jude swings in like he was caught in a net that he was excited to be caught in. He smells like burnt sugar and the rain that forgot to happen. He leans over the counter and bites my forearm because he is a feral child from a nice family and I love him. He says, tell me. I tell him. He says, oh. He says, oh. He says, I had a dream where I was a jar and someone kept putting different things in me and forgetting what they were and I think I woke up as a refrigerator. He says, I like the lady who is a salad. He says, does she have a brother? He says, do not look at me like that or I will steal your grandmother and make her my husband.\n\n\u201cYou are not allowed to marry Abuela,\u201d I say, correcting him because petty is a language we learned together. \u201cAnd if you try, the saints will come off the wall and put you in an old jar forever. You will have a label but no expiration date.\u201d\n\n\u201cSexy,\u201d he says, reading his own heartbeat like a gossip column. \u201cSo Saturday, yes? We go to her table and pretend not to be poor. We will wear hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will wear hats,\u201d I agree, and the word hat feels like an amulet that got cheap in the wash and still works a little. \u201cBring your wrists. She will give them a compliment.\u201d\n\nHe looks at his wrists like he just owned them. \u201cThey have been waiting for validation from mold. Honestly, haven\u2019t we all?\u201d\n\nNight comes back around with its pockets full of change. The pier is a sentence waiting for its verb. The wind pretends it has always come from this direction. I take the salt square out of its wax again when I get home and hold it in my palm like a small animal that would like to be a stone. It has made a little damp around itself on the dish towel. It is scored more deeply than it was before, like a map remembering its river. I bring it to my nose like a fool and of course it makes my mouth flood, of course it makes me think of every bad kiss I ever had and all the good ones I did not have yet. On the table, the note lies under the pepper grinder. It has bled a little where the blue pen met a drop of water. \u201cyou are late,\u201d it says, and then in tiny script on the back that my eye skipped until it did not: \u201cwe waited anyway.\u201d\n\nI am not crying when I lie down. I refuse. My eyelids dampen on their own like the city dew. My dreams are not water this time. They are brick and line and gate and a list of words that all mean door in a language I have to learn by sleeping. When I wake at 3:03, for no reason, with my hands above my head like I\u2019ve been surrendering in a more fun place, the apartment smells like lemon and like something that learned to be itself without my permission. The trolley goes by and the whole building wants to hum along. My mother\u2019s jacket hangs on the closet door like a person. I say her name into the pillow because the pillow will not judge my accent. The wind lays its weight on the window and then rolls off, satisfied.\n\nOn Saturday, we will go to the market with hats and wrists and smell the bees thinking. Today, the city holds her breath and lets it go and holds it again. Somewhere, a pipe shifts in its sleep. Somewhere, a gull steals a coin. Somewhere, a girl drops a candle in the wrong place and finds herself loved anyway. The river remembers, just a little. The lemons on my counter turn their faces to the window. The square in my kitchen listens, and when I touch it, it is not cold anymore. It is the temperature of a hand. It is a letter that has added a line. It says, if you open, walk. It says, if you close, sing. It says, we will use your name when we have to and not before. It says, try to be on time.",

The light is loud already when I open my eyes and the salt square on the counter has made a ring like a wedding on the wood, a perfect pale halo that makes me feel guilty for having dropped oil near it ever in my life. The note under the pepper has bled itself into legibility, party trick, and added a line that looks like a mouth in profile. I brush my teeth and it tastes like I have been eating ocean air. Abuela is humming in the living room, an old song that makes the carpet look like it might decide to be a field. She holds up two hats when I come out, one with a brim like a plate you could serve oranges on and one with a bruise at the crown where somebody once loved it hard.\n\n\u201cWear the ugly one,\u201d she says, not even pretending I get a choice. \u201cSomeone will give you a compliment because they think you need one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very direct,\u201d I say, putting on the hat that looks like it has a history and letting it sit too far back on my head because I always forget that hats have laws. \u201cThe salt wrote again.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will,\u201d she says, as if I told her the dryer finished its cycle. \u201cDo not bring it. If it misses you, it will find your wrist. Eat something that has a grandmother. No smoothies.\u201d\n\nI eat an egg that likes me back and a piece of bread that Abuela toasts in a pan like a person who never learned to trust appliances. The phone buzzes with Jude telling me he is bringing a hat that is technically a costume and that he will be late on purpose so we can arrive like a pair of people who do not care. I put a lemon in my bag and a handful of quarters because nothing good ever came of pretending you couldn\u2019t buy parking if you needed to. The coin that is not mine yet not gone is a weight in my hope, a bruise I poke with my tongue. The mirror goes into the bag too, wrapped in the red scarf I stole from Lina the year we decided to be women with scarves and failed by Thursday.\n\nJude is already on the curb outside my building, obviously early, wearing something that looks like he raided a costume shop for a gardener who is also a well-paid witch. The hat is a floppy green thing that sits on his skull like a pet. His wrists are on purpose. He twirls when he sees me because he is a weather vane for approval.\n\n\u201cWrists?\u201d he asks, thrusting his arms out like offerings.\n\n\u201cExquisite. The mold will propose,\u201d I say, and he clutches his throat like a maiden and slips into the passenger seat with a noise that is either a sigh or the hot coffee stabbing him in the thigh through the paper cup.\n\nLittle Italy pretends it is a village and does a good job for the first hour of the market, when the white tents are still crisp and the wind has not yet decided to flirt with anything expensive. Salvador waves a peach at me like it\u2019s a warning and I buy two because his eyes are irresistible in their pitying disdain. The air is already making a decision about direction; it comes from the east and then the west in one breath, doors misaligning, and you can feel people\u2019s hair arguing with itself in their shadows. Jude is already coveting a cake he will regret smelling.\n\nMireya\u2019s table is a map made of wedges. She has the yellow dress again but it has a denim apron over it with flour ground into the seam, and her hair is an argument with her hat that the hat is losing. Bees orbit in a wide calm ring that reads as planned to anyone who hasn\u2019t had them baptize their scalp. A sign hangs from the canopy with the goat drawing she mentioned, and the font on BASTA! CHEESE is somehow both angry and charming in a way that makes you open your wallet faster because you feel flattered by your own cheekbones. She does not look up when we arrive, which means she sees us without eyes.\n\n\u201cWrists,\u201d she says, and Jude preens like a cat accepting praise from a statue. \u201cLet me see. Mmm. These are bread-cutter wrists. Useful.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou cannot say that to him,\u201d I scold, but I am laughing because he has framed his hands in the air like a museum hang.\n\n\u201cI brought my mouth,\u201d I say, offering it like a sacrament. \u201cThe river behaved in public. The tunnel is a door that we told to go into a different hallway.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will find another hallway,\u201d she says, not put out. \u201cPaper beats salt sometimes. It\u2019s very rude.\u201d She lifts a wedge with the knife, sets it on the paper like she is setting down a slug and a gem at once. \u201cTaste. This one is desert window. It has the wind in it from a place where wind gets around with nobody telling it which way to point.\u201d\n\nThe cheese does something to me that is embarrassing to admit in a crowd. It is dry and oily and there is a bright on the back of my tongue like the sudden memory of a word I learned as a child and haven\u2019t had to speak since. It tastes like a lot of things I have never tasted\u2014dust that has been kind, mesquite shadow, goat laughter, a hint of something metallic like the inside of a balloon\u2014and it tastes like my mother putting on her jacket in the kitchen while she eats the last bite of toast over the sink because she will eat properly later, she swears. Jude\u2019s eyes go huge because he is watching my face like a movie he wants to narrate.\n\n\u201cYour mother?\u201d he says softly like he has put his finger into a song and felt the edge.\n\n\u201cShe smoked cigarettes in the doorway,\u201d I say, the fact rising up like a fish. \u201cShe told me to practice doing nothing with purpose. She said otherwise everything would slide together and I would have no handholds. She could peel an orange without breaking the peel. She never saved a bag.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Mireya says, and the ah is not pity and not interest and simply room. \u201cGood. Your mouth remembers. This will help you be impolite to the right people.\u201d\n\nA booth three tents down is a little universe that looks like it hates us. There is a backdrop with a photo of the ocean turned into a smiling faucet. A banner reads COUNTY WATER SOLUTIONS in a font that is polite the way a door that has been oiled is polite. A woman with a polo shirt and a tiny microphone kisses the air with her hand gestures as she says the words Community Stewardship and Environmental Compliance and Tours Available. The table has a fishbowl full of pens and a stack of flyers with a cartoon droplet wearing sunglasses. You can smell toner and the ghost of electrical fires. Paper is a spell; you can see the edges of it like heat waves, how it quivers around them. A man with a clipboard and a posture like he has never run unless chased points out a diagram to a grandfather who nods like he is listening but is actually hearing the tambor in his blood because there is a band tuning up by the fountain.\n\n\u201cThey set up here every third Saturday,\u201d the woman to the left of us says, sotto voce in the way of someone who loves gossip and hates conflict. She sells candles shaped like animals that look slightly melted and extremely loved. \u201cThey give out those drops and tell you to plant natives and then last year my neighbor got a notice that he was using too much water washing his truck and I thought he was going to die of shame on the spot.\u201d\n\nMireya rolls her shoulders back like she is making a square for something heavy to sit on. \u201cGo listen,\u201d she murmurs to me. \u201cDon\u2019t speak. Not yet. If you speak too soon, paper will make you promise something you can\u2019t keep.\u201d\n\nJude has already wandered over with the bright idiot fearlessness that has gotten him out of more trouble than it gets him into. He collects a sticker for me that says I HEART RESPONSIBLE REHYDRATION and three pens that probably dry up before we get to the car. The woman with the mic smiles at me like she is tired of smiling and too well-trained to stop. Her hair is the exact color of a fence made new. Her nametag says KRISTIN with a K that strains to be formal and begs to be liked.\n\n\u201cHave you heard about our ocean-to-glass initiative?\u201d she asks, and I do not say, yes, I had it in my mouth last night and it tasted like a question we should have asked thirty years ago. I take the flyer. The paper hums like a refrigerator, very faint, just enough to call insects and people who like to fill out surveys.\n\n\u201cWhat happens to the salt?\u201d I ask, because not speaking is not an art I practice well.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s returned,\u201d she says, and she says it like a lullaby. \u201cReturn is the most natural thing in the world. We return. The sea returns. It\u2019s a circle.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes circles are cages,\u201d Jude says cheerfully, because he has never been able to stop himself from bending language back on the person who made it. \u201cSometimes returning is just called not leaving.\u201d\n\nKristin\u2019s smile clicks an inch tighter. She does not flinch. She taps a laminated photo of the plant where it looks like a very clean hospital that happens to be married to a very enthusiastic pipe. \u201cWe disperse at a rate that meets and exceeds state standards,\u201d she says, and you can hear her audit feel proud. \u201cThe brine comes out perfect. It gets mixed before it can become a problem. We are committed.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what?\u201d I ask, and her eyes do a thing like a coin rolling and then lying flat.\n\n\u201cTo working with community members,\u201d she says finally, which is very nearly a sentence. \u201cWe have tours.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like tours,\u201d Jude says, inventing himself as a person who likes tours because the idea of infiltrating anything in a legal way gives him sugar highs. \u201cDo we get to see the pipe? Do we get to taste anything? Do we get to ask the pipe about its feelings?\u201d\n\nKristin laughs as if he has made the same joke she has heard twelve times and still wants to like. \u201cWe have safety guidelines.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaper,\u201d whispers Mireya behind me, the word both warning and caress. She is holding a jar of honey near her shoulder and the bees have begun to lightly test the air around it like a necklace. I can feel a shift in the light like a cloud snuck into the market without paying. When I glance down the aisle, I see spilled salt, except it is not spilled, it is falling, soft, a faint sift of white that makes people squint and look up like they will catch a flake on their tongue. It is so slight that your brain wants to call it dust because dust is the polite way to name the odd things the world does when you are not watching.\n\nThe first bee that hits my cheek does not sting. It lands and lifts and lands like it is unsure of the floor. The second one is drunk with the wrong air. Mireya\u2019s shoulders change shape. The jar disappears into the basket so the nectar is not a song in the wrong room. The bees get confused but not mean. They rise higher, their circle tilting, a soft felony in the air. People tug hats, laugh in the tense way that means a story later if it goes right, a siren if it goes wrong.\n\n\u201cSugar,\u201d Jude says, like a prayer and like a curse at once, and then his body finds its place the way his body always does around spills. He pulls his squeeze bottle from his satchel because there is always a squeeze bottle in his satchel and mists a veil around us. The air catches it and brings it back down a few inches away, and the bees do exactly what they do when you distract them with work\u2014they slow, momentarily befriended by the task of cleaning their sisters, tongues out like secrets, feet moving on their faces like handkerchiefs. Mireya\u2019s voice is small and specific, humming a shape in her throat that lets the bees put their heads on it.\n\nThe drift of white is not ash. It is salt, so fine that my lips taste it and my eyes water without my consent. It catches in the corners of signs and lies along the edge of the tent like the sign of a church that forgot itself on a weekday. People begin to say the word weird in voices that want to be brave. Kristin\u2019s mic picks up the catch in her breath and broadcasts it. I want to put my hands on the legs of the canopy because I suddenly love the idea of a roof with a purpose so hard it makes my fingernails hurt. The salt makes patterns on the pavement where coffee spilled earlier and I see the river in the city where there is not one, little tributaries of this unwanted weather.\n\n\u201cSing,\u201d the note at home says to the part of me that is willing to take instruction like a wild plant. Open, walk. Close, sing. If I open here, everything walks, and not all of it knows where it is going. If I close, somebody will call me selfish. I put my mouth to the idea of a song and my throat refuses to be pretty. Mireya hears that and smiles with her eyes.\n\n\u201cUgly,\u201d she says, approving, and I find the tune that lives in the kitchen when the pot refuses to boil. It is the song with no words that Abuela uses to tell the rice to stay soft even though she took her eye off it for a minute to yell at the radio. Jude catches it in his mouth like a penny and hums too, a lower line, his chest against the table, his wrists finally doing their holy work of being hinge and hinge and hinge. The bees respond by becoming heavy around the honey they cannot see. They gather into an idea and the idea becomes a little living ornament on the edge of a sign that says CASH OR CARD. It is beautiful in the way a problem is beautiful when it becomes visible.\n\nSomeone laughs like a collapse and a tent down the row does the Tower\u2019s trick. The pole doesn\u2019t split and its canopy doesn\u2019t fling itself dramatically into traffic, which would at least be theatrical. It just sighs, a simple failure of attention, and the whole white expanse slumps and then leans and then lays itself over a table of soaps and jams in an exhausted attempt at being shade. There is the collective intake of breath that a crowd does when it loves a little catastrophe. Nothing is broken because the jars had that luck you can\u2019t pay for. A woman comes out from under the tent like a bride who changed her mind and thinks she can get away with it if she doesn\u2019t make eye contact. The salt settles. The bees knit themselves into a quieter ruffle.\n\nKristin has not moved. Her mic has dutifully stayed on through everything and now when she clears her throat, we all hear it, the sound of a woman who has been told she has to start again at the part where she reassures us. She looks at me, which is a mistake, and then she looks at Mireya, which is a bigger mistake, and you can see the paper magic around her make a fist and then uncurl because it has been seen. Her voice wavers and then steadies. She asks if we have any questions. I tell myself not to ask one with teeth.\n\n\u201cHow far does your return go?\u201d I ask anyway, and the question is a coin that has been in my mouth too long. \u201cHow far, in miles, in hours, in wind? How far in fashion? How far does it go before it becomes something you pretend never started with you? You say, out at the outfall, it mixes. What happens when the wind is wrong? What do you call that?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnomaly,\u201d she says, and someone near us laughs in the rude way that means dissent. \u201cWe call it an anomaly. Our monitoring at the site shows\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNot your site,\u201d Mireya says with the gentleness of something about to grow teeth. \u201cThis site. Your site isn\u2019t the ocean. It\u2019s your site.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are in compliance,\u201d Kristin says, and I think about the wind trying to find out who that is, compliance, and bringing back handfuls of her hair to lay on her doorstep. She leaves us with a promise to put us on a list. She writes my name hard enough that the pen almost breaks. Jude wants to put a sticker on her shirt that says we waited anyway and lives for the rest of the hour in the place in his mind where he is both a saint and a problem.\n\nWhen it\u2019s over, the salt scum along the tent edges looks like the edge of a bath nobody has drained yet. Mireya takes a dish of water from the woman with the candles and washes the little cluster of bees gently off the sign, her fingers like weather around them, and they shiver into themselves and rise, nothing injured by accident except our pride. I rub my wrists with rosemary out of habit and because it feels like a sentence I forgot to finish. A gull lands on the canopy and slaps it with his feet like a cheap drum. It is the gull with the nicked wing. He looks at me like he drew me and wants notes. He drops something onto the tablecloth and hops two steps sideways like a magician revealing a dove, and there it is, the coin, the exact coin or its perfect cousin, copper corrected by the sea, the face a scratch of a man with a laurel that could be a fish if you squint. The salt has crusted one edge into a ridged line. My stomach kicks like I drank water too fast.\n\n\u201cRude,\u201d Jude says in deep admiration of the bird, and I put my hand above the coin and then down because I am not going to play coy with a gull. It is cold and I am not. It feels like a yes I didn\u2019t deserve.\n\n\u201cDo not say I love you on the asphalt,\u201d Abuela\u2019s voice says in my ear, and I swallow the words like a bitter. I look at Mireya because I cannot not, because gratitude is a hand that wants to put itself somewhere, and her face is a little hungry for me in a way that embarrasses us both, and on the other side of my embarrassment is something like joy.\n\n\u201cBring it to the plant,\u201d she says, too quickly to be casual. \u201cBring the coin. We will go on the tour. We will be good and we will not bite anyone until the part where biting is invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cTuesday,\u201d Jude reads off the flyer because he is nosy at an Olympian level. \u201cTen and two. We can skip work if we call it education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a model employee,\u201d I lie, and then when the woman with the soaps hugs her soap back into standing, I help right the arm of the tent with the movement you learn from making beds that never stay made. People look at each other dead in the face like weather conspirators for a minute, and then the market returns to its ordinary ritual of feeding strangers.\n\nMireya hands me a wedge wrapped in paper that says in a handwriting I recognize from my own skin, for your grandmother\u2019s mouth. The bees are quiet now and one hunts my hat brim like it wants to sign it. We sit on the curb with our hats throwing silly shapes on the asphalt and lick sugar from a paper boat because Jude cannot walk away from a churro vendor like a decent liar. A child straps himself into a stroller like he is the bus driver to the day and the wind sits down for a smoke behind the post office.\n\n\u201cWhat did the note say this morning?\u201d Jude asks around cinnamon and grease.\n\n\u201cIt said I was late,\u201d I say, looking at the coin against my knee in the light, loving it like a person I should not kiss. \u201cAnd then it said, we waited anyway. And then it said, if you open, walk. If you close, sing. Which is useful but also like being told to be water and fire and to bring snacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do two things,\u201d Jude says, and he says it like he is willing to do four if I ask. \u201cYou have a stupid large mouth. It\u2019s a miracle anything stays inside. It\u2019s my favorite thing about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe plant,\u201d I say, because it helps to say it out loud, because paper magic hates being acknowledged by anyone but the people who wrote it. \u201cWe will walk in like we came to learn and we will learn and we will close our mouths until it is time, and then we will push on the part where the door sticks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will wear my nice shirt,\u201d he vows, and Mireya snorts, the sound like the exact second a rind cracks under a knife. \u201cShe will wear her wrists. You will wear your nose. We will not look at anyone with love on concrete. We will lie with our eyes and tell the truth with our breath. We will bring lemon. We will not bring salt.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not bring salt,\u201d Mireya repeats, and she is not smiling now. \u201cThey will notice it. They have dogs for it. Or paper dogs. Same difference.\u201d\n\nWhen I get back to the shop with my hat doing crimes on my head, Abuela is telling a woman about the way smoke gets into fabric and slowly undoes the part of you that pretends it isn\u2019t hungry. She kisses the wedge through the paper like a saint\u2019s toe bone and puts it on the shelf behind the register like it is a relic. She doesn\u2019t ask about my coin but her eyes flicker to my pocket as if all pockets are transparent to grandmothers, a natural law they don\u2019t brag about because why bother. We sit on the floor for a minute while nobody comes in, the kind of minute that makes you remember your knees have feelings.\n\n\u201cI sang in public,\u201d I confess, as if I put a spoon in a socket.\n\n\u201cYou will sing in a worse place soon,\u201d she says, satisfied. \u201cYou will be so embarrassed you will think you are dying and then nobody will die and you will be mad you lived with that hair and that shirt on. And then you will be proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about paper?\u201d I ask, thinking of Kristin\u2019s voice and how tired it was under her training. \u201cNot books. Paper that grows like a weed. Paper that wants to make a house out of a lie.\u201d\n\nShe laughs, mean and full of love. \u201cI know everything in this city was built on a piece of paper and that none of it asked the ground permission. I know the man who married your mother and father forgot to sign the right page and so they fought for ten years like ghosts because the paper would not let them stop being together in the only way that counted there. I know permits are like lemonade. They make everything look sweet and then you put your tongue in and it turns your face into a new thing. I know you can write a thing back. You need a better pen. The blue one is for coupons. Bring a black one to the tour. Make your letters look like a fence.\u201d\n\nAt home, the salt has done another trick. It sits where I left it and looks exactly the same if you are a stranger, but when I lift it, the bottom has printed itself onto the countertop in a fine echo of lines that are not cracks but rivers. A child would call it a map without knowing it is a map. The lines are uneven, deliberate, the way a hand draws the same thing ten times until it remembers itself. The note on the table has more ink now because I cannot leave anything alone. It says, if you are open, walk. If you are closed, sing. Underneath, in the new tiny script that seems to arrive when the day has been rude, it says, you are not a tower if you kneel.\n\nI kneel because it tells me to and because I am tired of being the only thing standing when the light goes wrong. The coin is warm in my palm, copper taking my heat like a rumor. The gull with the nicked wing will live as long as gulls live, eternity tied to a parking lot. The plant will open its doors because paper demands it. We will wear our hats like amulets and Jude will compliment a pipe and Mireya will smell like the inside of a cave that keeps secrets like seeds. Abuela will send me with a black pen and a towel. I will forget the towel and she will laugh and the brine will sigh at my ankles and salt will make my mouth honest even when the rest of me is dressed for company. The world will be rude. We will be ruder. We will be on time.",

The salt square on my counter has made itself at home, nested in its own damp ring, but it has the patience of an aunt today and doesn\u2019t write. The coin is in my pocket, copper against denim, a temperature that feels like a small animal deciding whether to trust me. Abuela makes me drink a glass of water with lemon and a little honey, which she does when she wants my mouth to be sweeter than my plans. She hands me the black pen, the one that makes fences, and a towel that is older than all my good intentions, softened by so many kitchens that it knows how to behave without being told. She looks at me over her glasses like she will not say a word about miracles and will count the forks when I get back.\n\n\u201cDo not sign anything you do not read out loud in your heart,\u201d she says, knotting her hair with one hand and the day with the other. \u201cIf you want to set a trap, do it where there are already mice. Paper has mice.\u201d She taps the pen into my palm three times and then again under my wrist like a priest pushing oil into skin. \u201cIf you feel a door open and you are not ready to walk, sing and make it close like a shy thing. Do not be the Tower in your shoes. Be a woman who knows where the windows are.\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u00ed,\u201d I promise, and she watches the word come out of my mouth like a smoke she is evaluating for heat. Jude texts me a picture of the green hat from Saturday upside down on his head like a turtle shell and I tell him to stop and also that we leave three minutes early because if we miss the turnoff I will never hear the end of it from the part of my brain that runs her own radio show where the host\u2019s voice is my mother\u2019s.\n\nWe drive north on the 5, the freeway already a necklace of unhelpful promises, the cars full of people having quiet fights with themselves about time and sandwiches and how to tell someone no. The lagoon mouths open and close along the way, Santa Margarita and Batiquitos offering up their flat brown tongues to the morning. When we pass the old smokestack near Carlsbad, it looks like a chalk finger pointing at a god the city forgot to believe in, and Jude salutes it because he is that kind of person, disrespectful and devout. The marine layer is peeling back to show a disrespectful blue that will make a lot of people brave later, in their shoes and in their emails.\n\nThe desal plant sits on the edge of a story the city tells about itself, all bleached walkway and polite fences, a shinily obvious future, the hum of water being told what to be and agreeing because rebellion is exhausting this week. There is a sign that has thought about flirting with us: Ocean-to-Glass in a font that wants to be friends with our grandchildren. A chalkboard tells us Tours: 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., and the space next to it is blank like a dare. A woman with a lanyard sits behind a folding table that is made less poor by a neat cloth and a vase of suspiciously cheerful succulents. Her nametag makes her KRISTIN again, K pronounced like a consonant that\u2019s good at filling out forms. Her hair is a good citizen. Her smile is the end of a line and the beginning of a script.\n\n\u201cYou made it,\u201d she says, like she knew we would not dare be late to something this official, and then we all pretend not to hear the little echo of her voice from Saturday where she said words that were meant to sleep under pillows instead of being used in daylight. \u201cSign in here and here. We have safety glasses and visitor badges for everyone. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re interested in learning about where our water comes from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere it goes, too,\u201d Jude murmurs, and I step on his shoe because our friendship is a sport with rules and because he will laugh and forgive me and then push harder in a different place like he always does.\n\nThe waiver has all those soft eyes in its language, the kind of grammar that makes you agree before your hand remembers how to write no. It says I acknowledge. It says I understand. It says I will not hold anyone responsible if my own feet betray me. It says there will be loud noises. It says I won\u2019t take photographs of things that make someone nervous in an office far away. There is a white space for my name that is both simple and important, and I say it in my heart out loud to test it, the way you test fruit with your thumb for that sweetness under the skin. I write my name. I write my last name so slowly the pen thinks it might be a painting. The ink is very black. I make a box around a paragraph that I cannot agree to because it says I will not touch any levers and I need the option of touching something with one finger like you touch a child\u2019s shoulder in a crowd, to say, wait. The box is not big. It is a neat fence. The letters I draw with the black pen make a little fence next to the words \u201creturn\u201d and \u201ccompliance\u201d and \u201cdiffuse.\u201d I do not draw the fence around the word \u201ctour\u201d or around the word \u201ccommunity,\u201d though part of me would like to chain-link those too, to keep them from being turned into excuses.\n\nKristin doesn\u2019t flinch when I read one sentence quietly to myself. She is a woman who could sell me a ladder and make me feel like a good person for buying two. She hands me the safety glasses and they make the world look like the world, but squeakier, and I am always the person who makes jokes about goggles and then tucks them in my bag later like a gift because the future loves to surprise me about what will be useful.\n\nThere are twelve of us in this morning\u2019s group, a cheerful ratio of retired couples with water bottles like talismans, a teacher on summer break who smells like patience that has been beaten into a shape that will not break, two men who are already asking questions about cost because they make friends with numbers to avoid the other things that want to hold their hands, a teenager with hair in his eyes who keeps his hood up like the world is a bit too bright, a woman with a baby in a carrier who is rocking a rhythm that is older than concrete, and us, three people dressed like a carnival that makes its own rules. There is also a man who walks at the back with a ring of keys on his belt and a hardness around his eyes that is less about mistrust and more about being tired of being asked to pretend the same kindness to the same mistake. He might be maintenance or security or the person who knows where the good cookies are and doles them out to the chosen.\n\nWe begin in a little classroom because all rituals start that way if they are going to work on people who don\u2019t want to be taken. There is a video. It has a whale at the beginning and then a child laughing and a view of the ocean that has been made to look less like a force and more like a friend. There are simple lines that make complicated pipes look like spaghetti you could untangle if you had a mom who taught you that trick. There is a timeline that begins in drought and ends in sunshine, and there are a lot of phrases that talk to you gently about Responsibility and Innovation and Partnership. If you listen under it, if you listen where Abuela taught me to listen, there is a whisper that says, we are using bigger spoons to solve a hunger that will not quiet down. There is a whisper that says, we have built a bed in a place the river did not choose, and then we told the river to sleep there and then blamed her when she kicked. The subtitles do not say any of that, so I cross my ankles and hold my black pen like a cigarette I\u2019m not supposed to smoke anymore.\n\nThe tour takes us out onto the metal grating where you can feel the hum in your ankles, through the room where filters taller than Jude act like polite bouncers, past the row of white tubes where membranes listen to water and tell it to shape up, into the hall where you can smell a cleaned kind of chemical that isn\u2019t bleach and isn\u2019t rain but lives at the party where they invite both. There is the control room with the glass wall like an aquarium, and inside there are screens, graphs scudding across their faces, numbers like very serious versions of astrology. The operators sit with their hands near their knees in that un-alarm that means if something goes wrong, it will be smaller if they get up slowly. Kristin is good at the part where she names the thing in front of us and then names the way it used to be done and then names the better way that is happening now. She is better at making me feel in on the secrets than I want her to be, which makes me generous and suspicious at the same time. She says brine in the way of someone who has been told to say it like an afterthought and not like a noun that gets to have power.\n\nWe stop at a window that looks out toward the lagoon, and the water sits there pretending to be a painting. The old smokestack is to our left, bony and ridiculous and somehow still something I love, and the day is putting its shiny shirt on by then, that tourist blue that keeps postcards in business. A gull floats by and stares at me like he knows my hair better than I do. He has a nick in his wing. He yawns without closing his eyes because he has bad manners and better things to do.\n\nWhen we get to the part about the return, there is a diagram, and the diagram is precise like a turnstile. Pipes go out. They are bigger than my optimism and smaller than my dread, and they split like a family that never learned to share. Diffusers make bubbles into a necklace in the water where the math says they disappear. The line that shows salinity is blue and then darker blue and then normal blue, and the blue is a lie the way all drawings are lies that ask you to trust them. Kristin says \u201cwe monitor\u201d with a smile that is almost a wince, and the black pen makes my fingers itch in that place where I didn\u2019t know paper could sweat.\n\nThe paper door is not the sign-in sheet. It is not the tour waiver or the brochure that shows me a photo of a woman who looks like me holding a glass of water like a poster for good behavior. It is the binder on a shelf in the little administrative nook where the wall is covered in framed certificates. It is stamped and initialed and laminated in places where someone got very serious about their job and forgot to look up at the sky for a week. It hums the way a beehive hums when the queen is pretending to sleep. I can feel it as a pressure under my fingernails, like I need to scratch at the air to make something equal again. The man with the ring of keys stands near the binder like he knows, not magically, not entirely, but in that way of someone who has seen papers undo people and is tired of mopping.\n\n\u201cCan we?\u201d I ask Kristin, and I make the word as small as possible, pointing at the binder with the pen capped, a child asking for more bread. \u201cI like to know what the paper thinks. I won\u2019t touch. I will only watch it breathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d she says, because she cannot say no to a sentence made of compliment and childlike curiosity, and she hands me the book the way you hand a stranger a baby, that mix of trust and terror. The binder is heavier than I want it to be and lighter than it should be if this is what it says it is. The pages smell like heat and toner and the way a room smells when everyone left it in a hurry and came back pretending they didn\u2019t. There are signatures that look like birds and signatures that look like machines and one that looks exactly like a mouth. There are maps that refuse to be art but are anyway. There are words that make a fence around intention and then cut a gate in it that only certain people can see. There is the permit, the one that says yes to return in a paragraph that is patient and proud, and next to it there are conditions written like guidance and love, measured in numbers that make the wind look like a well-behaved dog.\n\nI take the black pen without uncapping it because I was told not to touch and I am a good liar only in moments when it matters. I hold the coin under my thumb on the plastic slipcover the way you hold a thing down that wants to lift. The coin warms and then cools in that beating way that could be my own pulse, which is cute if I\u2019m being generous and annoying if I\u2019m being me. Mireya stands close enough that I can smell caves and bless her for not pretending to be somewhere else. Jude stands far enough that he can ask a question at the right volume when I nod. The man with the keys looks at the counter as if it might misbehave.\n\n\u201cDoes your permit say what the wind has to be doing?\u201d I ask, because the pen wants a yes or a no to bite, and Kristin smiles with all her training like she can make that answer into a calendar.\n\n\u201cWe have monitoring at the site,\u201d she says, and the phrase is a sink with the stopper in it. \u201cWe meet and exceed state standards. The plume\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere does the paper say \u2018no\u2019?\u201d I interrupt, because I can be rude when a door starts to open without asking my name, and I feel the bite of that in my tongue like a lemon seed. \u201cNot that no. Not no to you. The one where the no is a gift. Where does it say, if this, stop. If east, wait. If bees can\u2019t fly straight, reconsider. If your operator breathes funny, call a grandmother.\u201d\n\nA man who is not Kristin but is near enough to the door to be an important noun appears as if conjured by the sound of his own handwriting. He has a badge with a photo from six years ago and a polo shirt that fits the way shirts fit men who got used to having people at their desks. He says he\u2019s the Compliance Director like he\u2019s meeting a neighbor in a shared driveway. He says the word outfall without apology. He says the word variance like it\u2019s a prayer. He says, \u201cOur modeling shows\u2014\u201d and I say, \u201cI know,\u201d and I don\u2019t, which is both rude and true.\n\nThe binder does not like the pen when I uncork it under my breath and make my fences on the brochure under the plastic. I draw a little box next to the paragraph that the man\u2019s finger hovers over, a box that isn\u2019t on the paper but lives beside it, and then I write in that box like a person who has a name and has decided to use it. If east wind shall exceed a mouthful, hold. If river shall put a skin on itself anywhere within the arms of this county, hold. If the gull with a nick asks with his wicked laugh, consider that a notice from the old managers. If bees cannot decide on a circle, halt until a woman with salt in her pocket says go, and if she has no salt, a lemon will do. If your operators look away when they say \u201cnormal,\u201d tell the pipe to put its head under a towel and breathe. If a grandmother prays in a language you forgot, listen.\n\nIt is ridiculous and it is everything. It is not a permit, except a permit is a letter and I am writing back with my mouth and my memory. I press the coin into the corner of the paper that is touching the plastic that is touching the paper that is touching the law, and I say my name the way Abuela taught me, the way the saints are supposed to, first and middle like a slap and a kiss. The coin doesn\u2019t spark because this isn\u2019t that kind of story, but the metal hum runs up into my wrist and down my chest like someone tuned me. The man with the keys looks up suddenly and stares at a point in the air where a fly isn\u2019t, his head tipped in that way dogs do when they hear a different frequency. Jude trips on air on purpose and asks the Compliance Director if the tours ever taste the brine, if there is a way to put the ocean back in your mouth with the math on it, and while the man is busy trying to make a laugh out of that, the screen in the control room grows a tiny flag next to one line that had been complacent for a long time. It is a square no bigger than a fingernail, effectively meaningless to a general public, a rubber plant brown that is not an alarm and not a compliment. I watch a hand in the control room reach across a console to silence something that didn\u2019t make a sound.\n\n\u201cScheduled test,\u201d Kristin says into the air in that almost-question way that means she hopes we will let her keep her job. \u201cWe do system checks. It\u2019s part of our\u2026\u201d She looks at the binder like it will admit to being a crystal ball, like it will read my fence handwriting through the plastic and punish us all with a paragraph.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d I say, backing up like a woman who does not mind being polite and doing her breathing outside. \u201cWe didn\u2019t bring salt,\u201d I add quietly to nobody in particular, and the air in my mouth says, good girl, the way a wretched aunt in a fairy tale might say it when you bring her an impossible object wrapped in an ordinary cloth.\n\nWe finish the tour with our ears doing that thing where they tell a different story than our eyes and our mouths behave themselves. The ultraviolet room is pretty in the frightening way of anything that kills invisibles and laughs about it. The pump hall roars like a political rally, and we smile like constituents and pretend we like the sound. The outfall is a line on a laminated map, polite and accurate, and the sea outside preens in the morning like she always does when a camera points at her. There is a mural near the exit where a little girl puts a cup under a tap and the artist has given her eyelashes that suggest she is destined for the kind of trouble I make, and I refuse to take that personally.\n\nIn the parking lot, the marine layer has gone to powder and the sun is an actor who took a workshop and learned about making an entrance. I lean on the hood of my car because it is still too cool to burn me and look at the old smokestack like a landmark in a dream where all the landmarks belong to someone else. The gull with the nick in his wing floats above our hood and laughs exactly like he did at the pier, like he would have been a marvelous uncle if he weren\u2019t a thief, and drops nothing, which is also a message where I live. The plant hums like an organ tuning itself. I can see the wind from here the way I can smell rain in other people\u2019s cities; it moves in folds, it makes small holdings; it hesitates and then decides. At my hip, the black pen has leaked a dot through the wrap of its cap onto my skin, a perfect kiss of carbon that looks like infinity if infinity wasn\u2019t such a show-off.\n\n\u201cScheduled test,\u201d Jude recites, mimicking that professional calm with a little wiggle of his shoulders because he can\u2019t not, then sits on the curb like a child who would love this more if there were pigeons involved. \u201cYou fenced the paper and it made the boys press a button.\u201d He wiggles his wrists like a composer did a trick.\n\n\u201cI sang very quietly,\u201d I admit, the words reluctant but true, and I hear the salt square in my kitchen making its little noises like someone heaps sugar with a spoon in the next room. \u201cThe not-salt in the air is listening. You know that heavy feeling when the world is deciding whether to be so kind it embarrasses you or so cruel it makes you shut up for an hour? That\u2019s this.\u201d\n\nMireya is very still, which is how I know she is thinking in a way that might burn her edges. She looks into the lagoon as if she is looking down into a pot that needs another minute, reading the surface for lies. \u201cYou wrote yourself into a thing that eats itself for breakfast,\u201d she says, but her voice is not scolding and not affectionate either; it is the sound you make when you tell a sourdough to be good and it decides to impress you with a new shape. \u201cNow it will come find you when it thinks it should stop itself and it cannot help it. Paper likes women like you because you taste like rules and broken promises. We will make a habit now of going where you are called. I do not like it. I will do it. We will do it,\u201d she adds, because she is made to say unhappy commitments in public.\n\n\u201cSaturdays and Tuesdays,\u201d Jude sings, making a calendar noise with his teeth. \u201cWe will have a dance card.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour wrists will be booked,\u201d I tell him, and then I loosen my grip on the black pen and think about how many fences I am allowed to draw before I have to climb one and scrape my knees. The man with the keys walks past us to a little side door and glances at us and nods like we are mosquitoes that learned not to bite a baby for five minutes. I nod back like I am a person who can distinguish between being tolerated and being invited. I am not great at that. I am working on it. I am going to write this down in a notebook with a goat on the cover that I haven\u2019t bought yet.\n\nDriving south, the ocean on the right looks very busy in that fake way water has of pretending that what it is doing matters to you. The billboards are already yelling about insurance and ice cream and I know which one I will listen to. Jude is quiet in the passenger seat, reverent when he knows a thing has happened which is not a story yet because if we make it a story too fast it will turn on us for having bad manners. He touches the side of my hand with the back of his knuckles and it is deliberate comfort, the kind that does not announce itself like a parade.\n\nI drop him at Sea Dragon and promise to tell Abuela the piece that will make her laugh so that she doesn\u2019t keep the towel this time like proof that I live under her fear. The shop is a collage of the same faces again, and the same faces are new because the wind has moved and told everyone\u2019s hair different things. A woman buys a candle shaped like a house because her landlord has become a different person this year and she needs a small permission. A man wants to return oil because it made him dream of a cousin he doesn\u2019t want to see and we both pretend it was a mistake in the bottle instead of in him. The girl with the scab comes back to smell the rosemary and brings a friend who wears her sadness like a new jacket. There are four quarters on the floor near the register by the time I sweep at three and I take exactly one of them and leave the other three for the container that keeps its own rules because luck likes to think we don\u2019t notice it.\n\nWhen we lock the door for an hour because Abuela says I need to eat soup if I am going to be allowed to make any decisions after five, she makes me sit at the back table and watch the steam like it is television. The soup is indeed too salty because Tavo brought it and put his pride into it and then forgot to check the ocean in his mouth, so I squeeze a lemon over it and we both watch the little storm that makes and right away. Abuela takes one sip and makes the face she makes when she is thinking of my mother, which is the face of a woman who tries not to be funny in church and fails. She says Mireya\u2019s name and makes it into a different word by putting her tongue on her teeth. She says Trouble like it is a new kind of music.\n\n\u201cShe said we would go where I am called,\u201d I tell her, because that and the gull and the scheduled test are the things I can say without the salt in my kitchen teasing me for telling stories in the wrong order. \u201cShe said paper likes me. She is angry about that, which makes me trust her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is angry about everything that thinks it can live without a mouth,\u201d Abuela says, tearing up a piece of pan dulce like she is undoing a mistake someone made with a blanket. \u201cRot is a mouth. Rot is a mouth that teaches you to pay attention to what is soft. If you do not listen to it, it will shout. If you ask it nicely, it will whisper all your secrets into the dirt and you will be safe again. But you must ask nicely. Mold does not forget when you are rude.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho will ask us nicely?\u201d I ask, because sometimes the world can feel like a line of people who want me to line up behind them. \u201cWho will say, please, to my face, instead of making a door inside my ear with a note that says late?\u201d\n\nShe takes my hand and puts it on the towel like it will remember the shape of it and then we will be able to tell if it changes while we\u2019re not looking. \u201cYou will,\u201d she says. \u201cYou will say please to yourself before any door. Then the door will not own you. It will be a friend you can be rude to when she is rude to you. Now bring me that black pen. I am going to write a letter to whatever piece of paper comes for you next. I will say, leave your shoes at the door. I will say, wipe your feet. I will say, there are old women here who do not care about your job title. I will say, try to be on time. I will say, if you wake my granddaughter too early, I will make beans and not give you any.\u201d\n\nThe salt square in my kitchen hums again after dark, and I go to it like a person might go to the mailbox in a small town where the mailman is your father and knows your secrets anyway. The ring it left has dried into a pale map that I know is a place but cannot place. The square itself has taken on a soft sheen that gives it a face in certain lights if I want it to, and I mostly do not. The note under the pepper has curled a little, the blue ink resisting the way paper tries to lie down and be less of a person. The coin under my palm is a truth I can hold, the copper always wanting to be more than one thing at once\u2014a face, a moon, a bite of electricity. I draw a fence on my own skin with the black pen and then wash it off because I am not about to let ink discipline me. The wind is not done doing weird things in this city; it knocks and doesn\u2019t wait and I refuse to make that a habit.\n\nThe day after the tour, the bees at Mireya\u2019s stand at the market are unbothered again like nothing happened and that is a different kind of warning. The woman in the tunnel has a thermos someone brought her and her girls have painted a flower in the curve of the culvert that is so ugly it makes me love it more. Jude puts salt on his grapefruit because he is perverse and laughs like he is editing his own heart with a pen nobody can see. The gull with the nicked wing steals an entire bag of potato chips from a man on a bench and the man lets him because there are some fights we want to lose. The pier makes old man noises because it likes to make me think it could fall apart and never does.\n\nI am not a tower if I kneel, the note said, and I practice it in my hallway where nobody has to see me fail in such an ordinary way. I kneel to tie my shoe. I kneel to pick up a drop of soup I spilled because I cannot talk without my hands. I kneel to smell the rosemary where it hangs by the door, the good petty plant, and I feel ridiculous and grateful and like the kind of person I used to make fun of when I was sixteen and thought rituals were just costumes and not love made into appointments. When I stand, the world is still the world, which is a relief and a disappointment in equal measure.\n\nThree days after the tour, a piece of paper arrives folded into itself like a shy animal. It is not mail because it does not have my address, and it is not a note because it does not address me, and it is not a permit because it has no numbers, which is a shame because I like to count the kinds of trouble I am about to get into. It is slid under the shop door in that moment before opening, when we have the door open a breath and the bell looks like it wants to try a new sound. Abuela picks it up like it might stain her hand and then looks at me like I brought it with my mouth, and I did, by writing back to a thing that expected me to be polite.\n\nOn the paper is a photocopy of a map, the kind from when the city was young and men with mustaches made decisions on a Tuesday and nobody argued with them until it mattered. The river is long where it is not now, the canyons are bigger where they have been told to be small, the ocean\u2019s lip is drawn like a skirt, and someone has taken a pen, not a black one, a blue one that lies, and drawn a circle. The circle is around a place I know the way you know the back of a person\u2019s head in a crowd before you know their voice.\n\n\u201cBarrio Logan,\u201d I say, feeling stupid and right at once, because the map is old enough that it calls it by a worse name and the circle is not on our block, not exactly, but near the place where the paint never dries and children climb each other to be higher. It is near the yards where they weld and the air tastes like work. It is near the freeway\u2019s bad dream, where it runs over us like a decision that never stops making the same mistake. It is near the water, which is trying to pretend she is not pinned down. \u201cIt is the place where the river used to pretend to be a creek and then pretend to be a ditch and then pretend to be a storm drain and then pretend to be a memory.\u201d\n\n\u201cLate,\u201d Abuela says, but she says it the way a person says grace, and then she blows on her coffee like she could cool the city with that one breath if she wanted to try. Mireya texts me a picture of a culture blooming on a plate into a flower that looks obscene and proud and writes, it is time to ask the bed to move. Jude sends a heart, then writes, I have a new shirt from the thrift, it is the exact color of a bruise on a peach. The salt square on my counter makes its tiny noise and cracks one thin crack more. The coin quivers in my pocket like it is a cheap compass and I am the wrong pole.\n\nWe go to the circle on the map on a Thursday because that is a rude day and this is a rude job. The freeway overpasses tangle overhead like fingers that didn\u2019t ask consent. The pillars wear their murals like persons, saints and women and the dead watching us with the relief of being above the ground for once. The underpass is an echo factory. The skid of skateboards is a prayer if you listen like you\u2019re supposed to. Children ride bikes around grownups\u2019 conversations as if they are planets testing orbits. The smell is paint and tire and mango and the kind of meat someone will yell at you about if you try to tell them it isn\u2019t good for them. The wind cannot decide who she belongs to under here and keeps walking away and coming back like a lover with a math degree.\n\nThe circle is a drain, of course it is, a pretty one because the art students came through at some point and decided that even holes need dresses. Around it, someone chalked a poem that has mostly rubbed away, leaving only the words mouth and remember and stay. The grate is clogged with the kind of story that makes nice people judge other people\u2014wrappers and cigarette ends and hair and petals from a celebration, confetti from a life. The world shakes off what it cannot keep everywhere you go; we just notice it more in these classrooms. The smell has that same wrong a note makes when you pick it out of a chord and give it its own room. It is salt, not new, this is not foam, this is not a prank, this is an argument that forgot how to be funny.\n\n\u201cReturn,\u201d Mireya says, the word not a question and not a complaint, and then in a murmur toward the grate she says destr\u00f3zate con cari\u00f1o, break yourself with love, and I realize she is talking to the kind of salt that needs reminding that not all destruction is the same. She kneels and puts her ear to the iron the way my mother used to put her ear to the wall and tell me which of the neighbors was fighting without actually wanting to know. Jude looks up, crossing his eyes to look at whichever seagull is trying to learn a new route, and counts under his breath, a baker counting for dough he will punch. I stand with the coin in my hand and let the black pen weigh the pocket under my hip because this is a paper place, a mean one, a legal one.\n\nThe grate doesn\u2019t sing. It has nothing left for art. It slumps under our attention like the tent at the market did, in a way that hurts less as drama and more as fate. The smell stings my eyes and I do not cry because I can hear a child laughing two pillars over, and that is a fence you are not allowed to cross if you want to pretend you do this for anyone other than yourself. I flip the coin once and catch it, stupid thing, trick my grandfather taught me that made me believe I could keep luck caged for a minute. The metal is cooler under here and the face on it is smoothed into abstraction by the sea, so I think of it as not a president but a woman with a laurel who used to be a fish.\n\n\u201cWhat did the map want,\u201d I ask the coin like an aunt who is a witch and a cat and a lie, \u201cwhen it circled you?\u201d I wait because this is a city where waiting is an occupation and because doors hate to be rushed by women. The coin warms in my palm and then in my other palm when I move it there and I say my full name again because it feels like a necessary indignity. I place the coin on the grate because I am a witch and a child and a person who believes metal likes to talk to metal. I write a fence around the hole with the black pen, which is nonsense and also ritual and also graffiti for people who prefer their revolutions legible only to ghosts.\n\nThe first drop is a joke, almost polite, just a little wet where there should be nothing. Then it moves like a sigh, skin trying to form and failing, the way the river did at Dog Beach, but this is not water doing water things; it is a mouth trying to speak and making a mess. The brine is not white here. It is clear and heavy and makes the air smell like a dead battery and a cut lemon at once. It is a visitor who did not bring a gift. It does not belong to this mouth. It is here because paper found a crack and water loves cracks more than it loves us.\n\n\u201cSing,\u201d Abuela says inside my head like she always does when my throat tightens with a brave thing I thought I wanted to do that turns out to be something I have to do. The options are always the same: open and walk, close and sing. Under concrete, at the edge of the shop, at the mouth of the tunnel, under the freeway like a kitchen under an armpit, the list keeps right on being rude about being short.\n\nI put my mouth near and I do the ugly song again because if I try for pretty I will lie, and the door will like me but it will not respect me. The note of it, the one in my ribs and not in my jaw, finds the part of the grate that isn\u2019t grate but a hinge, the part that remembers opening. The crack becomes a different shape, shorter and meaner, a thing that doesn\u2019t get to be a corridor anymore. Mireya hums through her nose in a way that makes me want to kiss the freckles nobody gave her and never will, and then she takes a jar from her basket and unscrews it under the edge where nobody can see because nobody is looking at us hard enough except the saints on the pillars, and she tips a whisper of culture into the crack like a secret. It blooms so subtly it might have been imagination\u2014no fuzz, no color, just a change in the way the stink sits, like the air just remembered its manners in church.\n\nJude does not make jokes because he can tell that laughter would be a wrong door, so he does his other holy work and counts, timing the drip to his heartbeat until the beat decides it prefers a different number. He concentrates on his wrists and makes his hands useful without touching anything, which is the trick of all men who do not want to be mistaken for the wrong kind of help. The drip slows. The skin makes and breaks and makes and tries to forget the trick it just learned. The paper that led someone to hook something into something under the street does not like us here, and it flutters in the pockets of the men going to work like a bird that cannot choose a tree.\n\n\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d I ask the hole like it is a person, which is an insult only if you are a person who does not like being asked plain questions, and I am not that kind of person. \u201cI brought no salt. I brought a coin. I brought my grandmother\u2019s patience up to here and my mother\u2019s terrible reckless everything over here, and I brought a pen that thinks it is a fence and likes to pretend words are animals. I can shut you. I can open you. I can sing or I can walk. Choose.\u201d\n\nIt is not speaking to hear it, what happens\u2014there is the minute change in the breath of someone behind me, the undercut of a skate wheel over a seam in the concrete, the very quiet not-cough of a gull, the reverb of the freeway deciding on a key. The brine stops pretending to want to be anything but itself. It pulls back in a kind of embarrassment I do not want to personify for it because I am trying to be kind. The compound smell dulls, then relocates itself to the place in my memory where batteries live. The coin jumps\u2014really jumps\u2014a millimeter under my palm and then lies there like a dead fish the way coins do when they are asked to be normal. The grate remains a grate. The note in my kitchen, which I cannot see, notes it in that way it has of writing after the fact like a mother who texts you to say she dreamed of you after you got home.\n\n\u201cScheduled test,\u201d I murmur, and I laugh because I cannot stop myself from making jokes that try to make the world feel less like a bar that never closes. The chalk poem around the drain loses the word stay to a skateboard wheel, and the child with the baby on her chest walks past us and says aloud to the air, \u201cIf you have to pee, hold it, mijo,\u201d and I think, yes, actually, that is exactly what we just asked the world to do.\n\nAfter we stand and pretend to be just women again instead of doors, Miriam from the hair place walks by and gives me that up and down that women give women they have known since middle school, the scan that cradles everything and complains about nothing. She says, \u201cYou look tired,\u201d which is our hello, and I say, \u201cRescheduled,\u201d which is our good-bye, and we both mean the part where the world continues to happen anyway. The bees, when we walk past the little citrus tree that someone has courageously planted in a place that will never be nice to it, are busy and uncomplicated. The wheels of cars roll over the same piece of concrete and you can hear them not making up their minds about whether to love it here. A welding spark jumps and falls like a star, and nobody names it.\n\nMireya presses her shoulder into mine once and makes the smallest sound, a human not-quite-hum that might be a thank you and might be a complaint and might be both, and then she stands away because we are not saying love on concrete today. She has flours in her hair again like she went home between the tour and this and wrestled a recipe to the ground. She will go to her stand and sell someone a wedge of something that will make their tongues decide to behave better for an hour. She will make jokes with a man who thinks he invented them. She will text me a picture of a jar of milk as if it is a baby and I will kiss the screen like a fool. Jude will go teach a boy how to frost something that does not want to be frosted and call it a spiritual practice. Abuela will tell a woman that her headache is from a man and not from the weather and the woman will cry and feel better and then worse and then spend seven dollars on a candle that will be very good to her whether she deserves it or not.\n\nAt night, the bottom drawer in my kitchen makes the noise it makes when something wants to be let out and is being polite about it. The salt square has changed in the way it always does\u2014it has turned more itself by a hair, which is a miracle that makes me tired and proud. The ring on the counter is an empire after a haircut. The note is a weather report for my heart. It says, we looked. It says, you sang. It says, someone tried a door at your shop when you were not there and will come back when you are. It adds a line, the handwriting stitching smaller and meaner and prettier with every night: the wind will ask you to pick a name. The coin is warm when I wake and cold when I lie down, which is my own trick too.\n\nWhen I do sleep, it is in the hour where late stops being a word and becomes a country. The pier is in my dream because it always is, and it is both falling and not falling, which is exactly like loving anyone, and at the end of it there is a gate, and the gate has a paper taped to it with my grandmother\u2019s handwriting that says, close like a mouth after you take a bite. The gull is there, rude cousin, and he lets me pet the good wing and that is how I know it is a dream. The wind says my name, middle and first, and then breaks into a thousand girls laughing like they just took off their shoes on a hot day and ran into the spray.\n\nI wake with a list in my mouth and say it into the dark like a spell. Bring the black pen and a towel and a lemon. Don\u2019t bring salt. Wear the wrong hat. Don\u2019t say love on concrete. Put the coin on the paper like a seal. Sing if you cannot walk. Walk if you cannot sing. Let paper be a person you can flirt with and say no to. Be late only in ways that the square allows. Answer the door when nobody knocks. Teach the grate its manners. Tell the culvert a joke. Ask the bees if they like your new hair. Stop at the market for peaches and forgiveness. Remember that you are the person at the pier whether or not anyone is watching and whether or not the tide lies to your face.\n\nIn the morning, the class of fifth graders on a field trip to the shop proves to me that the only real magic left is the noise thirty children can make with their hands when they are allowed to touch every candle on a shelf. One of them, a boy with a scowl that looks borrowed from his uncle, stares up at the mural above our door and says very serious, \u201cHer eyes move,\u201d and then shrugs when his friend tells him he\u2019s stupid because he is not, not at all, not in the ways that matter. I give them bad advice and good candy and send them into the day with rosemary under their nails and the idea lodged in their heads that doors can be pointed at things and not only on hinges. When they leave, the quiet comes back like a cat that forgives me once a day for not talking to it the right way.\n\nI wait for the wind to ask me for a name. I wait for the paper to try a new trick. I wait for Mireya to ask me for something I do not know how to give her and will find that I do, in the wrong pocket, in a jar in the back room, in a song I hate. I am bad at waiting in the way that women in my family are bad at waiting\u2014we make soup while we wait and then we feed the city and the city is less mean to us for a minute. The world phones me while I am cutting string and doesn\u2019t leave a message because she knows I will call back. The note under the pepper lifts its bottom edge and lies still when I look at it and I do not pretend to be surprised. The coin keeps its counsel and my hand keeps smelling like lemon even when I wash it four times. The bees memorize my wrist. The pier is the same and entirely different. The tower is a card in the deck that I have refused to lose and refused to draw and I can feel it every time I shuffle.\n\nIt rains in August one afternoon the length of a cigarette and the city acts like someone kissed it with teeth, surprised and insulted and hiding how much it liked it. The salt square glows in the gray like a lie that wants to be a truth. The paper at the desal plant has a little box next to a line that has existed for years and nobody ever drew in, and now it is there and we all pretend it was always there because admission is messy and recordkeeping is cleaner. The gull steals fries from a girl with two rings in her mouth and she lets him because she is trying out being generous. The woman from the tunnel hums a pickup line at a cop and gets away with it because she is braver than God. I sell a bundle to a man who looks at me like I look like his sister and for five minutes I let him and then he remembers his own and pays in cash.\n\nWe are not late, not exactly, not anymore, not in the way the paper meant. We are right on time in the way a lemon is right on time when your mouth forgets to be kind. We stand on thresholds like we were built to and our knees hurt a little and we laugh too hard and the city makes a noise like a stove cooling down. The wind asks me for a name while I am rinsing rice for dinner, the question so clear it comes out of the faucet with the water: what will you call what you do so you can say no to all the other names. I say, I am the woman at the pier who drops a coin and writes back to permits with a pen that thinks it is a fence. I say, I am Marisol who is Sol who is Mari who is the middle one and the end one and the one who brings extra lemons in case. I say, I am thresholds like my grandmother said, and I am tired enough to be beautiful when I do something that hurts. The wind says, okay. The wind says, then come outside.",

                              "content": "The wind\u2019s voice is not the same as the ocean\u2019s, and I know that tonight because when I step into the hallway with my shoes in my hand, it says my name like it has an appointment with me and not like it\u2019s hoping I\u2019ll wander past. It comes in segments, in square breaths that make the doorjambs quiver and the light over the stairwell flicker like it\u2019s thinking about being a lighthouse and then remembers electricity is a job. I put my palm to the wall and feel the faint shiver of other people\u2019s television laughter and the deep bass of a neighbor\u2019s fight that is so old it has learned to only speak in sighs. The coin bumps my thigh like a nervous fish. I go down the stairs sock-footed until the concrete tells me it is time to be a person again, and I put my shoes on and tie them with the kind of care I reserve for a ritual I refuse to name. Outside, the air is a spoonful of warm honey and dust, sweet until the back of my tongue finds the sting.\n\nI don\u2019t lock the door because Abuela is awake with her rosary in a pile on her lap like a string of small headaches, and because the building knows my feet as well as I know its temper. The street is the sort of empty that makes you think you misplaced a holiday. A man in a sweatshirt with the hood up walks his insomnia back and forth in front of the liquor store, and a palm tree scolds the sky the way old women scold children at the bus stop for forgetting their sweaters. The mural above our shop is awake in the light from the streetlamp, the six hands looking like they have been asked too many favors and will answer anyway if I stand here long enough with my mouth trying to memorize a word. When I whisper \u201cportera,\u201d because I am not clever enough to come up with a new name and I am tired of saying witch to people who hear different music, the eyes in the painted palms do that thing they did when I was small and insistent, that soft double step that tells me I am not wrong to believe I am being watched with love.\n\nThe wind wants me to go toward the pier and I want to go toward the alley, and for two blocks we negotiate like cousins. The city at this hour is mostly cats and freight. A trolley mutters secrets to itself on the tracks. A pair of lovers use the hood of a car as if it is the only flat surface that can hold their conversation, and I look away because I know what Abuela would say about concrete and declarations. The gull with the nicked wing ghosts me from pole to pole, looking sated and smug, which is how gulls look when they have done something rude and were not punished. At Broadway he descends and walks with me like a dog who refuses a leash, heels like he learned posture in a previous life, and when I stop at a crosswalk because the light tells me to, he looks offended like I have embarrassed him in front of a friend.\n\nWhen I get to the end of the pier, the boards are not doing their ghost-mouth trick, which is almost worse. The black of the water is honest in a way it forgets to be when there are crowds to entertain. A fisherman stands hunched over his bucket like he owes it rent. A boy throws a net badly and then better and I fall in love with him for six seconds and then remember I am not allowed to collect new boys for stories like baseball cards. The wind is stronger here and it is not a weather; it is a posture. It sets its shoulders and tells the flags to behave. It opens its palm and lets small trash perform their ballet. It smells like basil and motor and the inside of a clean cup fresh from a cupboard nobody opens enough.\n\n\u201cPortera,\u201d it says in that square way, and I nod like we have met at a party and are pretending we are friends. The word sits comfortably on the inside of my lip, like a cut I keep touching with my tongue. It is not the kind of power you put on a business card. It is the kind you write inside your own name and underline twice and don\u2019t tell the boy you are kissing because it will scare him in a way he will call romantic. I take the coin out and balance it on my middle finger like a second knuckle. The gull shifts his weight and mutters something obscene at me in bird, which is a dialect that sounds a lot like cigarettes in a church parking lot.\n\nI\u2019m expecting a door in the obvious places\u2014under the boards, in the black water where the city keeps its bad temper, in the air where the salt makes shapes like saints. The door is not a hole tonight, and when I finally feel it, it is because the hairs on my wrists lean toward the street instead of the ocean, and the pier itself shifts its attention like a man in a pew whose phone lit up in his pocket. The door is in the lights. The streetlamps along the promenade are elbowing each other like men at a bar, and the hum they make has a seam down the middle that didn\u2019t used to be there, a split, a hinge. I have never put my hand on a city light with anything but dislike\u2014too white, too sure\u2014but I do it now because the wind asks me to and because I am tired of letting the wrong things be in charge of my etiquette. The metal is warm and mostly indifferent. Then it isn\u2019t. Then it pays attention like it has never been asked to before, like its job description always included answering me and nobody told it.\n\n\u201cOpen?\u201d I ask, and the word is not a magic word so much as an introduction to a conversation that is going to take the rest of my life. The light flickers, and for a second the edge where the globe meets the neck is more than hardware. I see a thin black line like the lid of an eye, and behind it, not light, not dark, but a small square of in-between that looks like the inside of my grandmother\u2019s purse where the pennies have lived very long lives. The wind presses against my back like a person who has forgotten where I end and they begin, and I put my mouth close to the seam because I was not taught to be afraid of doors smaller than my hand.\n\nThe first thing that comes through is not a voice, but an absence, as if the light forgot to burn and instead remembered to listen. There is the paper scratch that accompanies bureaucracy when it is trying to seduce you into thinking you are being included, and there is a lemon rind bitterness at the back of my throat that tells me salt has been thinking about me. I say my name in that slow, two-handed way, the way you pass a heavy dish down a table, and the seam widens as much as a blink. It\u2019s nothing and it\u2019s enough. Behind it, I do not see anything that would make sense if I describe it. I see heat gathered into a fold. I see dust arranged like a choir. I see an index of laughter.\n\n\u201cWalk or sing,\u201d I hear in the part of my head where my mother keeps her leftover advice, and it is an easier choice than I want it to be. I am tired enough to walk even if the floor is a question. I am smart enough to sing if the crowd asks me to. I put the coin against the seam and the metal does not spark and does not bite me and does not anything except admit the fact of my knuckle. The door opens the way a mouth opens when you decide to forgive someone because it is easier than hating them that day. I step my left foot in first because I am not an idiot and because my body is making decisions faster than my brain can get a hand up to interrupt.\n\nInside is a hall that is not a hall, and I know it because it has more corners than a geometry book and none of them behave. It smells like cheap paper and wanted things, the way zoning proposals smell when they are printed in back rooms by men who do not live in the neighborhood they are measuring. It smells like beeswax over those smells, which is somebody\u2019s grandmother insisting the mess be pretty. There are drawers in the air, shallow ones, like the kind you keep flat things in and pretend are organized. There are lists that fidget when I pass them, like children who can\u2019t help but kick the back of a chair. The wind cannot come this far and be itself, so it follows me as a polite chaperone, a hand to the small of my back that never touches me and will shout my name if I try to open something that isn\u2019t mine.\n\nI don\u2019t know how long I am in the lamp, which is the sort of sentence only a person I do not want to be caught by would write, but the city keeps doing its shallow breathing outside and the boy with the net laughs and drops the weight of his net on his own shoe and says a word his mother would have pretended not to hear. The drawers open not when I pull them, but when I remember the thing they were meant to hide, which is maybe always how drawers work if you are honest. The first one is a sheaf of maps like the one that found us at the shop\u2014long river, narrow river, nonexistent river, the line of the freeway like a signature pretending to be a spine. Someone circled places and then circled them again until the pen broke through the page in a perfect, ugly little hole. Someone wrote Not Yours in a tidy corner and then crossed it out, and I love them without reservation for their temporary bravery. The second drawer holds a stack of stamped receipts that all say \u201creceived\u201d in the kind of ink that looks old immediately, which is a trick paper plays to make you forget it just learned how to walk.\n\nThere are permits, yes, not the ones we saw, not the show papers, but their mothers, drafts with the big words crooked and the numbers crossed out and the notes in the margins that say we can get away with it if we call it something else. There are memos named for innocence that talk about \u201cemergency authorization,\u201d and they smell like coffee and sunscreen and the inside of somebody\u2019s Lexus. There are names. There are all the ways a city says yes to itself without asking its body. I make myself read without flinching for as long as I can stand it, which is not long, and then I fold the corner of one paper with the most audacity and tuck that corner under the corner of another and make them promise to argue about it while I sleep.\n\nWhen I close the drawers they do not resist me. Nobody is trying to trap me here except my own predisposition to be precocious. I take out my black pen because I promised myself I would, and I write on the air where the list keeps trying to arrange itself, a fence I can fit a woman through. It\u2019s not law. It\u2019s the neighbor who sits on her porch and watches and whose mouth is so small you never expect the things she will say when she finally lifts her hand. If wind at east, howl at ten and not at three. If brine at mouth, place your tongue in your own cheek and wait. If bees in circle break, close the window, not the hive. If a gull with a nick looks at you, say, I see you, and do not lie. If a grandmother\u2019s towel dries slow, do not ask for rain; ask why you forgot to wring it. Do not take permission from anyone who cannot say your name without your middle. Do not sign what you could sing. Do not sing what you could walk. Do not walk if a child is asleep on your shoulder.\n\nI step out of the lamp because it is polite to leave before you are asked, and because the wind wants to say something to me and refuses to come inside. The gull is temporarily uninterested in me and is yelling at another gull about a french fry near a trash can that will tip like a drunk if anyone asks it to dance. The fisherman looks up and then looks down, and that could be my magic or it could be the beautiful arrogance of a man ignoring a miracle for his own sanity. The boy with the net swears again and does it better. A woman in a jacket with an old band\u2019s name on the back leans her chin on the rail and gives the ocean the kind of dirty look you give a lover you refuse to stop going home to.\n\nThe wind laughs as much as something square can laugh. It puffs my hair up until I look violent. It presses its single word against my jaw. \u201cOkay,\u201d it says again, and this time the okay is not permission and not compliment; it is agreement, like two women at a bus stop who do not want to be having the same thought and are united by it anyway. It has a job for me and I know it, and it is not a job with a diagram and payment. It is a job as old as the part where people believed water was listening to them even when it was busy being itself.\n\nIn the morning, I pretend I am going to be reasonable. I put on the normal shirt for selling candles to people who do not want to talk about why they are buying them. I put the coin in the pocket that does not feel like a shrine. I make Jude coffee that tastes the way he likes\u2014too sweet, almost vanilla, the color of a friendship bracelet\u2014because he is coming by before opening to tell me the story of a woman who cried at Sea Dragon because frosting looks like snow and snow is not a California memory, and Jude is collecting other people\u2019s weather the way some people collect shells. He arrives with a croissant that looks like it was rolled by a mean grandma and hugs me so hard my shoulder pops, and when I tell him I climbed into a streetlight, he closes his eyes like he is having the kind of fun that makes him late to work.\n\n\u201cYou are going to get electrocuted by a metaphor,\u201d he says, and then kisses my forehead like he is a mother I got from the thrift store. \u201cWe have a meeting this week,\u201d he adds like it is the same sentence, that city council desk-of-doom thing where people who think they invented neighbors get to say a bunch of words at us and then ask us to be impressed by their ability to pronounce the names of streets that existed before their parents did.\n\nI know about the meeting because the paper told me in the lamp in the way paper always tells you, with a schedule that pretends to have been agreed upon by everyone because nobody was invited to disagree. It is at six on Thursday because that is when it can be said that the city is welcoming and also when most people are wiping the day off their faces and not in the mood to kiss a microphone. The agenda is tart and orderly. \u201cAdjustments to Outfall Procedure.\u201d \u201cEmergency Variance Reauthorization.\u201d \u201cCommunity Comment (Three-Minute Time Limit).\u201d There is a little box next to \u201cCommunity Comment\u201d and in that box, in the lamp, I drew another box because it is what I had. The box is nothing and the box is a fence and the box is a song, and if I am not careful, I will believe my own trick.\n\nAbuela is unimpressed when I tell her about the streetlight, which is to say she is secretly delighted and will not let me know because she wants me to be braver and not think bravery gets me out of sweeping. She straightens the towel over her shoulder and takes my face in her hand and makes me open my mouth like I might be hiding something under my tongue and speaking around it. \u201cSay your name like a curse and like a prayer,\u201d she instructs, which is not new, and then she adds, \u201cBring eggs to the meeting. They do not like to be seen by eggs.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want me to throw them?\u201d I ask, and she gives me the look she saves for the moments when I pretend not to know better.\n\n\u201cBring them to sit next to your heart,\u201d she says. \u201cPaper has eyes for heat. If it sees a child, it will decide to behave. Sometimes. Bring a towel. Bring the black pen. Bring money for parking even though you can be rude about parking if you have to. Wear shoes you can kneel in. Wear no perfume because perfume is lying and this week we are not lying more than we have to.\u201d\n\nMireya texts me the single most domestic photograph I have ever seen from her, a colander of lemons that looks like a sculpture of a woman\u2019s mouth breathing, and writes, \u201cThursday. I will bring the patron saint of mold in a jar and keep him in my bag unless the air starts to behave like a tongue that needs reminding. Wear your wrist bones out. Those help.\u201d She adds a photo of her ankles in socks with goats on them, which I am not sure is a threat or a blessing. I send her a picture of my black pen and my worst hat and my coin in my palm, the lines of the copper faking constellations, and she sends back a voice message that is only a laugh and it sits under my ribs like a found penny.\n\nThe shop is busy the next two days in the way that happens when people can smell something they can\u2019t name and think they can hide it by buying something that smokes. A woman from National City tells me she woke up with salt on her windowsill and that she knows how ridiculous that sounds, and I tell her it sounds like a letter address and she cries for exactly the amount of time it takes for me to find the good rosemary, not the polite kind. A man buys another baby-shaped candle and does not make eye contact because he has started to suspect the baby is not changing his neighbor\u2019s drumming and that he might have to be the person who asks. Teenagers make nests of their own knees in the corner and talk about teachers as if teachers are mythical beasts, and I sell them a bundle of basil like I am the aunt who gives them a bus pass in secret.\n\nAt night, the salt square does not write. It sits like a small elegant person who refuses to perform for company. The ring on the counter fades and then returns, and the pattern changes just enough that if I stare at it long enough I can convince myself I am learning a new language. The note under the pepper has a new line in the small script: \u201cIf you must be late, bring a chair for the person who isn\u2019t.\u201d The coin goes hot-cold hot-cold in my pocket in a pattern that, if I were a worse person, I would say feels like an instrument tuning itself. The gull with the nick or his cousin or his wife stares at me from the lamppost every time I look up, and one afternoon when I am making change with my hands like a magician, he throws a peanut shell at the window like he wants me to know I could never survive in his family.\n\nThe day of the meeting, the light is the kind that makes people\u2019s teeth look better than their intentions. The marine layer gave up at eleven and roared off like a bored aunt, and the sky has the angry clarity that makes tourists fight with each other about whether they packed the right shoes. I dress like a polite person. I dress like the kind of woman men thank from the dais. I dress like I am about to tell the truth and apologize afterward for not being a different shape. I put two hard-boiled eggs in my bag next to the black pen and the mirror and the towel, and I tell Jude if he eats them because he thinks it\u2019s funny I will bite him on the wristbone where it will bruise scenic. He wears the bruise-colored thrift-store shirt and looks like a civil servant lost in a poem. He wears cologne because he is a liar and I tell him to knock it off at the door, and he rubs his wrists on a rosemary bush and complains about being made into a salad, and a woman passing by says, \u201cThat is not an insult,\u201d without breaking stride and I wish I had wrote that down.\n\nCity Hall wears its history in stale air and marble like gilt on a saint, and I love it in the way you love the house where you had your childhood fevers. There is the big room where they do the important pretending, with its speakers and its high walls and its parking-lot chairs dressed up like church, and then there is the anteroom where paper flirts with paper on bulletin boards and notices curl at the corners from the humidity of mouths. We put our names on the slip for public comment. The clipboard weighs more than it should. There is the three-minute timer like a joke in bad taste. There are men in shirts that fit their stories and women in shoes that make them respectable, and there are a few of us dressed like we do the work of holding the world down while it kicks.\n\nKristin is there in a suit that makes me want to put her feet in a bowl of hot water and peel a clementine for her while I scold her for doing a job she\u2019s too good at. The Compliance Director is there with a stack of paper that could be biblically unkind or extremely boring depending on who reads it. There is a man from a consulting firm whose jawline suggests he has never sweated in public, and he says \u201cdispersion\u201d like a dessert. There are a few grandmothers lined up like saints outside a bad bar. There are three kids who brought their skateboards and changed their minds inside and now hold their boards with embarrassment and devotion because they wanted the boards to see this too, in the way you bring your child to something that will hurt and help. Nobody has salt because the signs at the door reversed themselves for us and said \u201cNo Weapons,\u201d and we obeyed because weapons are a word paper uses when it wants to remind you it can be scared.\n\nWe are late in the good way because our names go on the second page of the public comment sheet in the spots that don\u2019t make people sigh when they sit there waiting to sing their three minutes into a clock. We are on time in the way my mother taught me to be, warm and unrushed and with our wrists clean. Abuela sits at the end of our row and does not clap for anyone because she doesn\u2019t clap in rooms with microphones. She holds one of the eggs in her palm like it is a rosary she is considering converting to. Mireya sits with her knees neatly together like a woman in an old photograph and smells like caves and Tuesday, and when a man in a suit turns around and gets her scent on him, he looks confused and charmed like he almost remembers the shape of the first place he was ever brave.\n\nIt goes how it always goes and how it never goes. The people who start say the numbers and the way the pipe acts like a necklace when it is miles out and all the shapes it makes that are good shapes, and the diagrams have arrows that do the polite thing of curving away from the places with children and into the broad beloved nothing of ocean. The east wind is an anomaly. The reverse wind is a quirk. The brine is returned. The plant is a mother who is too tired to breastfeed all the time and must be forgiven for using a bottle sometimes because the baby will not notice if we are very good at pretending. A man says, \u201cWe are a thirsty city,\u201d and a woman says, \u201cWe are an innovative city,\u201d and another man says, \u201cWe are in compliance,\u201d and then someone remembers to say, \u201cWe understand your concern,\u201d because they have learned to say it in training and it has paid the rent on their car.\n\nThen it is the turn of the people who smell like rosemary and bus stops. A woman from a fishing family stands and tells the story about the day she went out too far and the water changed color in a way it doesn\u2019t do when what is in it is just itself moving around. She says, \u201cIt tasted wrong on my teeth,\u201d and a man in the second row flinches because he is so tired of not being allowed to use the good words. A teacher speaks for exactly three minutes with the exact quiet obscene intensity of a person who has counted children through a fire drill. A boy holds his skateboard like a shield and says, \u201cI can\u2019t skate under the bridge when it stinks like a battery,\u201d and looks at the floor like he might vomit because his voice did the thing voices do when you are proud and hate it.\n\nWhen it is our row, Jude stands first because he is the person who makes the jokes so the rest of us can be strict. He introduces himself with a title he invented and a bright smile like he is attacking the room with kindness, and he tells the room about bees not being drunk when they are confused, and the way a circle breaks when the air loses its manners, and how you can mist sugar to keep panic from being contagious. He says \u201cdispersion\u201d like a woman who is tired, and two men on the dais smile without meaning to, and it breaks their faces into people for half a second. He says thank you and then rolls the thank you on his tongue like he\u2019s tasting whether it deserves to be swallowed, and the buzzer doesn\u2019t get to him because he sits down before it remembers to try.\n\nMireya stands and the room adjusts its bra like it has a crush it doesn\u2019t want to call by name. She does not say her last name. She says, \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d and everybody hears the other parts of the sentence. She says, \u201cWind moves like a woman who left and came back to get her earrings,\u201d and the stenographer laughs and then looks at her fingers like they misbehaved. She says, \u201cSalt is a worker and you cannot pay it with compliments,\u201d and she says, \u201cI make rot on purpose and I know the good kind when I smell it in a room,\u201d and she says, \u201cWhat you return is larger than your modeling will let you admit because you have taught your paper to believe a diagram more than it believes a child who says his boards won\u2019t roll.\u201d She does not raise her voice. She speaks like a deadline. She doesn\u2019t run out of time because when the little red light flicks, a bee appears out of the heating duct and lands on it and sits there until it turns green again, and yes, it is a coincidence, and yes, it\u2019s a miracle, and yes, it\u2019s a trick, and yes, it\u2019s the only reason the men on the dais get to hear the last sentence, which is, \u201cDo not ask us to drink your variance and call it rain.\u201d\n\nI stand because it\u2019s time and because the eggs in my bag have reached the exact temperature where they are the same as my body. I say my name the way I promised. I say I live on the block where the mural above the shop looks at you and has opinions. I say I have a grandmother who can hear a lie through the sink. I say I have put my ear to the tunnel. I say I have put my tongue on the wind. I say I have put my pen on paper that does not belong to me, but belongs to all of us who have to sleep with the windows open because we cannot afford air conditioning and so we inhale whatever experiment you think you can hide in a long paragraph. I say if you must make a bed under my house for the pipe to sleep in, move it on Thursdays when the wind is wrong. I say if your paper cannot write the word east in a sentence that ends with stop, then I will write it and tape it to your door. I say, \u201cDo not be late to your own decency,\u201d and the buzzer sounds and I have to stop, which is maybe the only time today a rule felt useful.\n\nThere are questions, and the questions are not bad questions if you devour them with the right sauce. There is a man who asks me if I am a scientist and I do not spit, and I say I am a person who knows a taste is a kind of data and you can put it on a graph if you are brave, and the woman next to him looks at her hands like she wants to take off her ring because it suddenly weighs more. There is a man who says \u201cperception\u201d and I say \u201cperception is a cousin of reality that sleeps on your couch and eats from your fridge and you have to love him because he lives there,\u201d and the man does not write that down because he does not want to admit it made his mouth want to smile. There is a question addressed to Mireya about \u201csources,\u201d and she tells the room she gets her milk from goats and her rot from the part of the air that has been hurt and still remembers how to cook. There is a question for Jude about his wrists and he gets to be funny and coy, and the room breathes, because we have to give it that, these small releases, or it will tremble itself apart.\n\nWhen the men in the chairs say \u201cwe will take your comments under advisement,\u201d the paper in the big black binder that lives in my bag now even if it never leaves the room quivers like a small dog in a storm. The man with the keys is there at the edge of the dais because he is everywhere paper is afraid, and he looks at me and nods in that way again, that mosquito truce. When they vote to continue the variance, because of course, because the story goes the way it goes until we ruin it, I feel something that is not surprise and not despair and is the quiet tightening a woman\u2019s mouth does when she decides she is going to be a problem for a long time but will continue to bring a towel.\n\nOutside on the steps, the wind does not bother to be square. It comes from the east and from the south and from the memory of somebody\u2019s mouth and it tastes like a lemon squeezed over the first soup of the day. The bees that followed Mireya are brief and disciplined and then gone, like theater. The gull with the nicked wing is eating a French fry out of a boy\u2019s hand because the boy is at the age where to be stolen from by a bird is the thing that makes the day feel holy. Abuela puts her palm on my forehead like a doctor and tells me my temperature is a prayer and that I need to eat if I am going to pretend to be wise again after seven.\n\nMireya does not hug me because we have agreed not to make confessions on concrete, but she stands close enough that our shoulders might as well, and she says, \u201cIt was always going to be Thursday. The bed will not move until someone falls out of it.\u201d She looks at the old smokestack far off like it owes her money. \u201cThere will be a night when they have to shut the pipe because they will be afraid of something that looks bad on paper and not because of anything real. That is your window. We will go then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat will we do?\u201d I ask, because I am ridiculous like that, still wanting to see a to-do list taped to a saint\u2019s chest.\n\nShe looks at me like I am a drawer she knows better than to open in public. \u201cWe will bring lemons,\u201d she says. \u201cWe will bring a towel. We will bring the coin and your grandmother\u2019s love and Jude\u2019s wrists and the name you picked, and we will teach the outfall to say please.\u201d\n\nThat night, the salt square sings in a key I haven\u2019t learned, and I lie on the kitchen floor with my head under the cabinet like a person hiding from weather and I learn how to hum it until my mouth gives up trying to be beautiful. The ring on the counter grows a peninsula. The note under the pepper adds, in the smallest, sharpest hand yet, \u201cWhen they close, walk.\u201d The coin is so warm in my palm it feels like it has been under a tongue. I sleep with it under my pillow like a child and a queen and a thief, and when I dream, the pier is shorter than it has ever been, and the ocean is so close I could push her with my foot, and the wind lays its weight on my back like a mother who finally sat down.\n\nMorning says it was kidding about being kind. The forecast is a joke. The east wind comes with her hands full of small lies and somebody\u2019s hair. The city smells like bread and batteries, basil and bleach, a parade of things you were not supposed to put next to each other on the stove. The gulls act like executives who can see the emails we can\u2019t. The first text comes from Kristin at an hour too precise to be accidental: \u201cOutfall maintenance tonight. 1 a.m. Temporary shut down. Modeling requires test.\u201d The second text is from Jude: \u201cI stole a flashlight from the back room at Sea Dragon and I think it is haunted by a guy named Ron.\u201d The third is from Mireya: it is not words, just a photo of her hands with lemon rind under the nails and a streak of blue ink across her thumb that matches the color of the sky when it knows it\u2019s been lying.\n\nAbuela watches me put the towel in the bag and the eggs back in the fridge and the mirror in the scarf and the black pen into the pocket over my heart. She puts a lemon in my mouth and says \u201cwalk,\u201d and then she kisses the top of my head and says \u201csing,\u201d and I nod like a parrot and like a priest. When I step into the hallway, the wind says my name like it\u2019s bringing me a bill and then says okay again, and I say it back, because I am that kind of fool, and because I have learned that sometimes the only way out of a door is to be rude to it with grace.",
