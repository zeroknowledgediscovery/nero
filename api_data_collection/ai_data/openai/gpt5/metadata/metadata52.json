     "novel_text": "Sunrise over Los Angeles was the color of a grapefruit slice, pink bleeding into orange, the whole bowl tipped on its edge. On the roof of the converted warehouse she rented down in the Arts District, Rayna Cruz wound the strap of her guitar around her shoulder and let the city climb into her lungs. She was not the kind of singer who needed a crowd to be loud. She had that lick of thunder in her anyway. If she didn\u2019t let it out, it left claw marks under her skin.\n\nShe adjusted the brim of her cap, yanked low over the shaved lines at the side of her head, the tattoo of a shuttlecock and a star peeking by her ear. The cap said STAY LOOSE in a font that looked like it had been cut with a razor in the 90s. Her brothers said she stole swagger from the radio. Her exes said she carried it like an old debt. Strangers called her a stud on TikTok, capital S, like a title. Rayna shrugged at that word. She knew herself. It wasn\u2019t a costume. It was the way she walked into rooms. It was the fact she could fix a sink trap, back a truck into a narrow lot, and carry a chorus in the same hour. It was the way she could stand still for someone else and then not.\n\nThe warehouse roof was warm even before eight. Down in the street, trash trucks hissed, men in neon vests yelled in kindness, pigeons watched like accountants. Rayna played a chord, then another, the sound bouncing off brick and sky, the city\u2019s echo a good kind of ring. Her fingers were a little raw from last night\u2019s run, but she liked the sting. It meant belief. It meant work had happened. She liked sweat.\n\nHer phone buzzed on top of the amp. She let it buzz. Another chord. A riff she\u2019d been wading into and out of for two weeks. It had a hook you could hang a coat on, a tail that wagged the rest of the song. She had eyes closed and teeth showing when the buzz stopped. Then started again in a panic-stutter. She sighed, rolled her shoulders, and glanced at the screen.\n\nUnknown number. +44 ahead of all the digits. Her heart did a stupid, swallow quick thing.\n\nShe answered with a lazy, \u201cYo,\u201d because if you start too eager, they hear you for what you want and sometimes that smell attracts sharks.\n\n\u201cIs this Miss Cruz?\u201d The voice was crisp and warm around the crispness, like a shortbread cookie dipped in tea. British, but not the fancy version of British everyone pretended to be when they called from overseas.\n\n\u201cThis is Rayna. Who wants her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Maya Patel, executive producer with\u2014\u201d a pause like she knew how names landed, \u201c\u2014with the team at Britain\u2019s Got Talent. Are you in a place where you can talk freely?\u201d\n\nRayna pulled the strap over her head and balanced the guitar on her thigh. The roof. The city. Her heart now a snare drum. \u201cSure. What\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a difficult woman to get a hold of. Emails to your agent were bouncing, and our Los Angeles contact gave us three numbers, only one of which was an automated recording promising taco discounts at a place that does not, tragically, exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI move fast.\u201d Her grin made its own weather. \u201cYou might have better luck on pigeons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll note that. We watched your bus stop show in Venice. Twice in our office, once at home. The internet has feelings about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the internet. It\u2019s a lot of feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica has you. We would like you, too,\u201d Maya said lightly. Then less light: \u201cWe\u2019re calling to offer you a wildcard slot in our final. You\u2019re eligible as a global invite. We do this sometimes. It upsets the purists. It lifts ratings. Our viewers will be ready to love you or boo you. Your audition tape\u2014with the crowd singing back your hook and your ex appealing to the security guard\u2014was\u2026 it was messy. But you weren\u2019t. It was very clear you know how to hold a storm at the center of your ribs. Do you want this?\u201d\n\nRayna stood. The city receded and came back, receded and came back. Down below, someone was shouting, \u201cHey! Hey! That\u2019s my parking space!\u201d and then laughter that sounded like parts rattling in an engine hood.\n\n\u201cDo I want\u2014\u201d Her voice broke very slightly, and she allowed it. \u201cI\u2019m good enough for your final? You\u2019re serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t waste international minutes on a prank. It\u2019s short notice,\u201d Maya continued, fast because she had a train to catch, Rayna could hear it, \u201cYou\u2019d fly this week, rehearsals next, camera blocking, a ridiculous number of \u2018backstories\u2019 meetings that you will hate but will survive, and then the night itself. You can bring your own band. Our team can arrange one. We have one request.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo pyro indoors without regulation. We say this to everyone, because every season, someone tries to set themselves on fire. Fight the urge.\u201d\n\nRayna sat down and then stood up again. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it. I won\u2019t combust on purpose. Probably.\u201d Maya laughed on the other end, a small, true laugh. \u201cYes,\u201d Rayna said, surprising herself with how small the word was. \u201cYes, I\u2019m in. I already am. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause where both of them grinned into the phone at no one. \u201cWonderful. I\u2019ll email you the preliminary schedule. We\u2019ll need vaccination records and visas and a list of your tech needs. We\u2019ll arrange hotel. And Rayna, because I like to say it: practice hard, but don\u2019t grind yourself into dust. We have cleaners for the confetti, not your bones.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up, Rayna pressed her fingertips to her eyes and laughed. She let it ring out over the roofs. A man on the next building over looked up from his jump rope and threw his hands in the air like a preacher. She threw hers back. She yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d to the morning, to pigeons, to America, to the British who might wave and boo in equal measure.\n\nHer day rewired itself. She slid down the fire escape deliberately wreckless, skipped a rung and then two. She took the stairs to her place three at a time. She woke the coffee machine like it owed her money. Her cat, Justice, blinked once, then twice, then flicked his tail at the idea of Britain like it was a metaphor for birds.\n\nNikki called as Rayna was leaning against the sink, watching the kettle, thinking about how she\u2019d tell her mother. Nikki didn\u2019t say hello. \u201cDid you die?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you dying?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, of delight.\u201d\n\nNikki squealed high and long, bounced across an octave, then said, \u201cYou don\u2019t squeal, so I have to do it for you,\u201d in that exact voice that had cracked the window when they were twenty-two and had a tiny apartment above a bar in Echo Park where no one ever slept.\n\n\u201cBGT,\u201d Rayna said, and the words tasted like something fizzy that had popped on her tongue. \u201cFinal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d Nikki shrieked again. \u201cMaya already DM\u2019d me for your paperwork because, quote, you\u2019re a plane with a radio that\u2019s been shot off by kids throwing rocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always go around me to find a grown-up. Are you free? Come scream at me in my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m halfway to you. I brought you the good tortas because this is a celebration, and I know you won\u2019t remember to eat once you start packing or, I don\u2019t know, shining your shoes.\u201d\n\nRayna looked down at her shoes. One scuffed, one scuffed and coming apart at the toe. \u201cThey have character.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have a character who has given up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want my shoes to reflect my inner life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen your inner life needs glue,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d\n\nLater, after tortas smeared with avocado and carnitas and after Nikki had danced in the kitchen with Justice in her arms like he was a beige bagpipe, after the small soft confession\u2014\u201cI\u2019m a little scared, Nik, will I be a joke?\u201d\u2014was countered with old-school ferocity\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know who looks better standing in front of a thousand people than you do alone\u201d\u2014Rayna sat at her table and made a list with a stub of a pencil and a receipt: passports, guitar strings, suits that were not a funeral, adapters, throat spray, lucky coin.\n\nThere was a knock while Nikki was telling a story about the time she mistook a famous actor for a plumber and asked him about grout. Rayna opened the door to a delivery man with a square, a little breathless from stairs.\n\n\u201cPackage for Ree-na? Or Rye-na? I always say it wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cRayna,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to commit. Like you\u2019re jumping a fence.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Rayna.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSign?\u201d\n\nThe box was black and white and striped, no return address visible. Inside, under tissue paper that smelled faintly of lilacs and pepper, was a pair of red suspenders and a note written in blocky capitals.\n\nWEAR THESE IN LONDON IF YOU WANT TO WIN. FROM A FRIEND WHO SEES YOU.\n\nNikki went quiet in the way she gets quiet when she\u2019s thinking too hard. \u201cThat\u2019s some Hannibal Lecter energy.\u201d\n\nRayna turned the suspenders in her hands. They were the color of first strawberries, of a phone booth, of caution made into desire. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s an old Butch Fairy Godmother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only fairies I trust are the ones with receipts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at one.\u201d Rayna slipped her arms into the straps and let the suspenders hang over her shoulders like a dare. She grinned at Nikki, a little crooked. \u201cHow\u2019s it look?\u201d\n\n\u201cGay,\u201d Nikki said affectionately. \u201cLike a patio in June.\u201d\n\nShe packed. She called her mother, who cried in the way she\u2019d cried when Rayna got her GED because some of the crying was joy and some of it was the shock of relief. \u201cYou won\u2019t be cold, will you?\u201d her mother asked. \u201cYou\u2019re not good with sleeves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a jacket,\u201d Rayna lied. Then amended: \u201cI\u2019ll take two shirts that together make the idea of a jacket.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d her mother said.\n\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd be careful with British men.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey look like they\u2019d steal your wallet and then write you a poem about it.\u201d\n\nRayna laughed and let the laugh be long. She loved her mother when her mother got silly, which had started, mercifully, again after the long stretch when her mother hadn\u2019t been silly at all because of the thing they didn\u2019t talk about and should have. Rayna hung up and thought about that unspoken thing for a minute and then put it away like a shirt she was saving for a better party.\n\nLAX was a wrestler that day, grip sweaty, shoulders broad. Rayna moved through it like she owned the place because the trick wasn\u2019t to convince others; it was to convince your feet. The plane was packed. Kids with headphones too big for their ears, a couple in matching tracksuits reading a guide to London that had a Union Jack on the cover like that helped with anything, an old man in a corduroy jacket who smelled like good cigars and old notebooks. Rayna had the aisle seat. The woman in the window seat wore a faded sweater with small embroidered birds and the kind of wedding ring that said she\u2019d kept it on through fifty years of dish washing, gardening, weather.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re off to London?\u201d the woman asked, and then, catching herself, \u201cWell, obviously you are. It would be an odd flight to board if you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRayna smiled. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusiness or pleasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth. If I do it right.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded with approval that felt like a blessing. She fished a hard candy out of her bag and held it out. \u201cPeppermint. I hoard them. Planes make me think of a church, and I always think of peppermints in church.\u201d\n\nRayna took the candy. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cRose.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice to meet you, Rose.\u201d They shared their candy like two children sharing crayons. After takeoff, Rose leaned toward the window and talked about the time she\u2019d been a chorus girl on a ship that sailed to New York and the way the sea used to feel like a rumor and the way she\u2019d danced past a man in a white suit and felt the first real danger of her life. \u201cI\u2019m rambling,\u201d Rose said, \u201cbut I\u2019m at an age where I\u2019m entitled to use words until others beg me to stop. May I say a rude thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe careful near the river,\u201d Rose said in a tone that had no jest in it at all.\n\nRayna laughed. \u201cYou mean the Thames? Why? Because it\u2019s wet?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it takes whatever you haven\u2019t decided about yourself and tries to hold on to it. Rivers do that.\u201d She pressed her hand to the window. Her palm left a little fog on the glass like a ghost had paused there to see if the world was still real. \u201cEspecially that one. There\u2019s a reason Londoners talk about it like it\u2019s a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cFor the warning.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t sleep on the plane though she tried. She typed notes into her phone until her thumbs hurt. She listened to the same song four times because it had the kind of gallop she needed. Words lined up, then broke ranks and ran. She wrote down fragments:\n\n\u2014 the sound of the crowd = not wind, not waves, maybe bees\n\u2014 don\u2019t smile until the second chorus, make them want it\n\u2014 call brother, tell him not to bet on me unless he wants to do dishes\n\u2014 the river\n\nThey landed to a smut-gray sky that had the decency to brighten as the plane taxied. Heathrow yawned, and Rayna yawned back. The customs line was a sorry snake. She put her palms in her pockets and rocked on her heels. She tried to look honest. She was honest. She tried to look like a person who would declare her almonds if she had any.\n\nA man with a cardboard sign that said RAYNA C in marker met her after baggage claim. \u201cMaya sent me,\u201d he said, accent deep London, syllables like bricks. \u201cI\u2019m Tom, runner-slash-asst. I do whatever she tells me until I pass out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice to meet you, Tom.\u201d She stuck her hand out. He took it with surprise and then decided he liked it.\n\nThey drove into the city through rain that couldn\u2019t make up its mind. The car moved like a cork in a river of vans and buses that looked like they were wearing red uniforms. Tom chattered about the best place to get falafel, the worst time to take the tube, the grocer who overcharged tourists for apples, the rumor that the pianist in one of the contestants had once been a bank robber. \u201cDon\u2019t quote me,\u201d Tom said, \u201cEnglish libel law is a dragon, and I am soft.\u201d\n\nThey pulled up in front of the hotel, glass and steel winking, on the South Bank where the river lay heavy and important like a dog who knows it will be fed. The hotel lobby was gray in a sexy way, men and women in suits that seemed to have been poured over them like sugar. Maya was waiting though she pretended she wasn\u2019t, looking at her phone and then looking right up exactly as Rayna walked through the rotating door.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Maya stood, smile bright but not fluorescent. She wore boots and a blazer, hair loose around her shoulders. Up close, she smelled like rosemary and printer ink. \u201cYou made it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Rayna said, and for a second, she wanted to hug Maya, which was ridiculous, because she didn\u2019t know her. They shook hands instead, firm like they were both checking if the other was an anchor.\n\n\u201cWe put you on the ninth floor,\u201d Maya said, waving toward the elevators, \u201cbecause the tenth has a bachelor party in it, and I believe in not forcing proximity with men in matching T-shirts. Do you need time to nap before we do stage? Our schedule today is a lighten-the-load sort, but television always lies about that.\u201d\n\nRayna shouldered her guitar. \u201cGive me ten minutes to not look like a person who just lived in the air for too long. Then I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nIn the elevator, Maya watched Rayna\u2019s reflection and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not what I expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore\u2026 legend. More persona. You have the persona, but you also have teeth. That\u2019s, forgive me, rare in our visitors from the States.\u201d\n\n\u201cI currently have most of my teeth,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll outsource the legend to the internet. They\u2019re good at that, when they\u2019re not busy falling apart.\u201d\n\nHer room had a view of the Thames. Boats slid like loafers. The London Eye turned slow like a thought you didn\u2019t want to have. Rayna leaned her forehead against the glass and thought: I will carve a space inside this place with my sound. Then she thought: That\u2019s a weird way to put it. Then she laughed at herself. Her brain was the kind that shook out the pocket lint in inappropriate rooms.\n\nThere was a card on her desk that said Welcome! in a too-cheery font, and a basket with fruit that looked like it had been groomed. There were flowers, lilies and something that may have been peonies. Tucked under the ribbon was a slip of paper like the one the suspenders had come with, blocky caps again:\n\nYOU LOOK BETTER IN BLUE. SEE YOU SOON.\n\nHer skin prickled. She held the note up like evidence and considered calling the front desk to ask for whoever had delivered it to be returned to sender\u2014No, she told herself. Maybe it\u2019s a fan with access. Maybe it\u2019s nothing. The suspenders had been funny. This was just theatrical. She shook it off and put the note in the drawer, where it sat like a little dark mouse.\n\nShe splashed water on her face, changed into a button-down that flattered her shoulders and her long, efficient neck, ran her hand over her hair, smiled at herself without the intention to seduce anyone but the person in the mirror. Nikki had told her once that the mirror loved her because she never lied to it.\n\nThe stage in the theater felt like an ocean floor, cables for coral. Techs moved like fish that knew how to solder. Everything hummed in a key Rayna could have bent with her fingertip if she tried. She did not try. She saved her strength for notes.\n\nTom introduced her to a stage manager named Liza with a Z and a tech wizard named Gary who spoke to lights like they were vulnerable children he was coaxing across a street. She shook hands with a keyboardist who had callouses older than most of her exes. She said hi to a magician who made a quarter disappear behind her ear and then asked, \u201cDo you mind if I borrow your watch for a trick later?\u201d She laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nMaya brought her to a corner dressed like a cozy living room and said they needed a bit for the roll-in, a set piece where she\u2019d talk about where she came from and why she sang, and they\u2019d cut it so that it made everyone root for her. \u201cWe tell these stories responsibly,\u201d Maya said, eyes level. \u201cWe don\u2019t trap you in your own biography.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll spare you the part where I did my homework under the table in a bar while my mom worked nights. Or maybe I won\u2019t. Depends on how you ask.\u201d\n\nShe talked for fifteen minutes. She told the camera about the bus stop shows and the odd way strangers will hand you their grief like a bag they don\u2019t want to carry anymore if you give them a chord to put it in. She told a clean version of her first fistfight and a messy version of her first song. When the camera turned off, she felt out of breath. The floor under her steadied her feet.\n\nShe ran the song once, then twice, then a half time with just the lights moving like they were reconsidering the room. People stopped and watched. People pretended not to be doing exactly that, then did anyway. She heard a stagehand murmur, \u201cGod, the American,\u201d and someone else murmur back, \u201cCalm down,\u201d and the first voice say, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWhen she came off, Maya gave her a nod, small but sincere. Tom handed her a bottle of water and a blueberry muffin that had too much crumb on top like a crown. \u201cYou need sugar. You were shaking. No one else could see, but I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shake because I care,\u201d Rayna said.\n\nOn the way back to her hotel, a man on the south side of the bridge bumped into her shoulder. Hard. Hard as if the city had pushed him. He wasn\u2019t large, but he was not entirely small. He had a rag of a bandage wrapped around his left hand, and there was a kind of waxiness to his skin that you saw sometimes on people who spent too much time in swimming pools or on pills. He muttered something that might have been sorry and might have been its opposite. His eye darted once, twice, like a fish in a too-shallow bowl. Rayna stepped back, and the river took a breath. Then the man was gone, absorbed into the afternoon. It left an odd taste along her gumline. She realized she\u2019d bitten the inside of her lip.\n\nShe had a call scheduled with a tabloid, which she would have skipped but Maya had used the kind of tone that vibrated the bones when she said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t say no to the Mirror,\u201d and she was trying to be good. She went back to her room. The river was the color of someone\u2019s old tea. She propped her phone on the windowsill and let the reporter ask his questions. \u201cWill you sing,\u201d he drawled, \u201cor will you seduce?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can multitask,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here to sing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re something of a\u2026 what\u2019s the phrase, a stud?\u201d he said, as if he were tipping the word off the edge of his tongue with his index finger. \u201cOur writers are already in love with you. The women, the men, possibly the pigeons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like pigeons,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cThey know survival.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Los Angeles? Will you miss it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways. Los Angeles is like family\u2014I can complain about it, and I do, but don\u2019t you dare.\u201d\n\nAfter the call, she lay on the carpet and thought about words like stud that had been slung at her like both coins and curses. She let the weight of them sit on her belly for a minute. She liked who she was. She had built herself the way she liked kitchens: tough, easy to clean, with a window that let in light.\n\nThe note in the drawer bothered her like a flea. She opened the drawer, looked at it again. YOU LOOK BETTER IN BLUE. SEE YOU SOON. She considered going down to the desk to ask who had access to her room. She called instead. The receptionist was apologetic and efficient. \u201cIt was delivered by an external party with permission from production,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the name as A. Bowman.\u201d\n\nRayna didn\u2019t know an A. Bowman. It sounded invented. The receptionist added, \u201cThey also asked us to pass on a\u2026 scarf? But we declined because we don\u2019t accept garments, it\u2019s a policy.\u201d\n\nGood policy, Rayna thought. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s probably nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never is, is it?\u201d the receptionist said in a way that made the hair along Rayna\u2019s forearms fizz.\n\nThat night, sleep came like a cat: only when she had stopped inviting it. Dreams did their more-than-usual nonsense. She was running through Venice, the boardwalk bending like a rubber band, and the ocean kept trying to come down the street, but it was made of people in gray suits instead of water. Someone was laughing. She was laughing, too, the kind of laugh that sounds like crying at a distance. She woke with her throat sore and didn\u2019t know why.\n\nAt three in the morning, London\u2019s night had a different set of teeth than L.A.\u2019s. Sirens had a different accent. Even the silence tried on another coat. Rayna pulled on her coat\u2014she had brought one, in the end, a peacoat someone had given her at a party in Highland Park because she had said, half-drunk, \u201cI like your collar,\u201d and he had said, very drunk, \u201cTake it.\u201d She went downstairs and asked the man at the door if she could walk. He looked at the river like it was an accomplice and said, \u201cStay on the lit side, yeah? Don\u2019t go behind the buildings.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. The wind was not cold exactly; it was nosy. She crossed the bridge and stood in the middle, watching the water try to pretend it wasn\u2019t moving when very clearly it was. Rose\u2019s voice whispered: Be careful near the river, and Rayna said out loud, \u201cI am.\u201d A couple walked past with their jackets zipped all the way up to their chins, their laughter contained by fabric. A cyclist whizzed by like a knife. A gull landed on the stone half a foot from her sneaker and cocked its head as if to ask if she had any chips, and if not, why.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have chips,\u201d Rayna told the gull. \u201cI have a song.\u201d The gull didn\u2019t care. The gull strutted an inch closer and then, deciding she was a disappointment, took off with a flap that smacked air.\n\nBehind her, someone cheered, softly. She turned, heart quickening but not in the dangerous way. A young woman, maybe nineteen, maybe twenty-one, with a tuft of blue hair under her beanie, held her phone out. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to scream because Brits don\u2019t scream in public unless they\u2019re footballing. But you\u2019re Rayna, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the rumor,\u201d Rayna said.\n\n\u201cCan I\u2026?\u201d The young woman made the international symbol for selfie. Rayna said yes, smiled, then stopped smiling and did her smirk because that was the one that circulated best. The girl\u2019s hands shook. \u201cMy mum loves you,\u201d she said. \u201cShe says you remind her of the girl she used to be. That\u2019s a compliment,\u201d she added, visibly afraid it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Rayna took the phone and took another photo where she looked less like a wolf and more like a grandmother, on purpose. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cEms.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Ems. Go home. It\u2019s late. Tell your mum I said she should wear leather again.\u201d\n\nEms made a face at the word leather that was mostly delight and a little horror. She skipped away, then stopped and yelled back, \u201cBreak them all, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d A group of boys came the opposite direction, hooded. One of them looked at her and then looked again, and his face rearranged itself into something she didn\u2019t want to name, so she moved on. The river did its river thing. She went back to the hotel. Her phone had a missed call from an unknown number, London code. She let it be. The voicemail was a rustle and a scrape and maybe a laugh, maybe a cough. She deleted it.\n\nThe next day at rehearsal, the lights failed right when she hit the bridge of her song. Pitch black. Someone yelled, \u201cHold!\u201d A curtain rustled. For a moment, a heartbeat, she heard someone humming the melody she\u2019d written, but slower, like a lullaby for a child who hated sleeping. She did not get goosebumps. Her goosebumps got goosebumps. When the lights came back, she saw movement at the edge of the stage, a shadow where shadows shouldn\u2019t cluster. The shape of a person leaning, then gone. She stayed where she was because she wasn\u2019t about to give the dark the satisfaction of her panic. She sang the bridge again, louder. Lights sizzled and obeyed.\n\nBackstage, a bouquet waited again. Hydrangeas this time, and the card tucked deep, like the flowers had its secret in their throat. It\u2019s funny, the way your eyes adjust to fear. They learn to anticipate the shape of the card before they see the white rectangle. Maya spotted her holding it and came over. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone knows I got to London before I told even my aunt,\u201d Rayna said with a lightness that was daylight on ice. \u201cDo your fans do this? Leave\u2026 notes that feel like they\u2019re peeking through a keyhole?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is to ask: are you safe?\u201d Maya took the card from her hands like she had authority to. The message, the same block capitals, said: YOU BROKE A STRING SECOND SONG LAST WEEK. I WAS THERE. NICE SAVE. TRY TUNING DOWN WHEN NERVOUS. SEE YOU.\n\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Maya said. She looked around, called over a person whose badge declared Security in all caps. \u201cWe have protocols,\u201d she told Rayna in a low voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll check tapes. We\u2019ll limit your room access to a smaller list. You\u2019ll have an escort to and from the hotel. I\u2019d rather overreact than under. If it\u2019s nothing, we\u2019re embarrassed. If it\u2019s something\u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t finish.\n\n\u201cA person who knows something about me is out there,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cAnd I would prefer if that person stayed in \u2018out there.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat we can do,\u201d Maya said.\n\nBy the time she went to bed, she had two new emails from tabloids with subject lines like: IS RAYNA CRUZ DATING? and WHO IS THIS AMERICAN? A kid from South London had sent a DM video of herself playing the hook on a recorder because she had broken her real instrument and the school would not replace it. A boy from Manchester had written: I didn\u2019t know you could be like that and still be normal and I don\u2019t know what that says about me (sorry) but my heart felt weird in a good way seeing you. She answered him carefully: You don\u2019t have to be a thing any way that hurts. That\u2019s the rule. Thank you for your note. Don\u2019t apologize for your heart being in the right place.\n\nThe city continued to have weather whether or not she made time for it. The British insisted on talking about rain exactly when it wasn\u2019t raining. Rayna got lost twice, badly, because London was less of a grid and more of a ball of rubber bands that rolled downhill and collected other bands as it went. A man on a bike shouted advice across lanes of traffic that could have killed him. She stood in front of a painting older than her entire family\u2019s documented existence and felt a bit dizzy. She ate a sausage roll that tasted like all the parts of a pig that had sworn to be delicious. She met a dancer in an elevator who had nerves that stood up under her skin like wires and who said, matter-of-fact, \u201cI vomit before every performance, and then I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nIn a small cafe near Covent Garden with pretty tiles and a waitress who said duck like a hug, Rayna sat with Shiloh, her manager, who had flown in late because his mother had had a scare and then was fine and then had told him to stop hovering around her like a satellite.\n\n\u201cYou look good,\u201d Shiloh said, stirring his coffee and then not remembering to drink it, jittering without input. \u201cInternet\u2019s a mess. Good buzz. Some ugliness, but not more than usual. Don\u2019t look.\u201d\n\n\u201cI looked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re forbidden from looking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI looked and I am still alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you die six hours later,\u201d Shiloh said, smile sharp as a bent staple. He leaned back. \u201cAll right, tell me everything. Don\u2019t spare me. I want the flavor.\u201d\n\nRayna told him. She did not tell him about the notes until he asked why she was looking over her shoulder in a place with a floral wallpaper. He put his cup down hard. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like this. I will get a person to stand outside your door who is large enough to be his own postal code.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaya\u2019s already on it,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cIt might be nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is never nothing,\u201d Shiloh said, echoing the receptionist without knowing it. \u201cI want you to take this seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Rayna wanted to argue and also wanted to be seen as capable. Both things fought. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Also, someone from press said they want to do a piece on \u2018the American stud,\u2019 and I said no because they don\u2019t get to do that. You are a musician, not a type.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am both. But thank you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cOkay. My set. They won\u2019t let me have a skate ramp on stage, which is fair. Insurance would erupt. But I want to open with a silhouette. I want the first sound to be breath, like I\u2019m inside your ear, and then the guitar hits like a door slammed on purpose. I want the lights to strobe on the words NO FEAR, but instead of the N, it flickers for a second, so it says either \u2018No fear\u2019 or \u2018Of ear.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOf ear?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to make people feel unsteady and then catch them.\u201d\n\nShiloh nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re mean,\u201d he said eyes bright with pride.\n\nThey walked back to the theater together and split at the stage door. Maya was there, hair up now, looking like she was trying to find a way to squeeze twenty-nine hours into a day without changing the laws of physics. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing your rehearsal to six,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with the harness for the aerialist, she got tangled like yarn, and I\u2019m trying to ask the crew to cut without the aerialist yelling at me in a way that will get us in trouble in the papers. Can you be flexible?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rubber,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cI bounce.\u201d\n\nMaya put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cI like you,\u201d she said, quick and honest. \u201cSome people show up like they think we\u2019re keepsakes.\u201d\n\nThe building had too many corridors. If you turned right, you hit a wall that said No Entry. If you turned left, you ended up in a room full of lamps and a guy named Carl who did not know why he had a room of lamps but was quite pleased about it. Rayna turned left instead of right, then right instead of left. She found a hallway that had lunch plates left outside of doors and the smell of gravy hovering low. A door clicked behind her. She glanced back. Nothing there. She told herself she would take a different elevator next time because this one made a noise like an old woman\u2019s knee.\n\nIn the bathroom, she washed her hands for longer than necessary. When she looked up at the mirror, someone had written on the fog with a fingertip: HUM AND BREATHE, DON\u2019T CHOKE IT. She spun around, heart in her throat, but the stalls were all empty. She wasn\u2019t even sure if the message had been for her. It might be a generic piece of good advice. She rubbed the words away with her sleeve. When she left, the corridor felt narrower than it had going in.\n\nThat evening, she sat cross-legged on the floor of her room with the guitar in her lap. She didn\u2019t care if the hotel frowned at the noise. She played soft. She didn\u2019t need to scare the tourists back into their suits. She had the window open a crack, because she liked to let air in even if the air was damp. Someone across in the opposite building played a trumpet badly for exactly eight bars and then stopped, probably because someone else had banged on their wall. Rayna smiled into the space between chords and then frowned because she could feel it again\u2014the thrum under the thrum, the city\u2019s own metronome. She tapped her foot. She let it align.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Nikki. FaceTime. \u201cShow me London.\u201d\n\nRayna swung the phone toward the window. Nikki said, \u201cLooks like Cleveland but if it was run by a swan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike actually okay or showbiz okay?\u201d\n\nRayna weighed the answer. \u201cI\u2019m okay, okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrink water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m drinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat vegetables.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d Nikki said, and then softer, \u201cYou\u2019re doing something big and scary. I wish I were there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see it,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cI\u2019ll be loud enough to cross a whole ocean.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up, Rayna went back to her guitar. She played until her hand hurt in a way that felt right. She sang quiet. She sang louder. She sang until her shoulders went from stone to forgiving. The river ran. People did the late-night things people do\u2014kissed, carried takeout, argued with their future selves, jogged because they were running from whatever they thought running could outrun. She slept without dreaming this time, or she dreamed without remembering, which is almost the same thing.\n\nOn the morning of the reading with the judges, a drizzle freckled the window. Rayna put on a shirt that made her look like she\u2019d been born knowing how to tie knots. She tugged at the suspenders in her bag and, for a memory, almost put them on before thinking better of it and leaving them. The elevator dinged. Tom was there with a clipboard and the face of a man who had already seen more than one hysterical argument about a fog machine. \u201cOur girl,\u201d he said. \u201cReady?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Rayna said, and meant it just then. She let the doors close. The river stood behind her in the glass, tall and patient. It had all the time in the world. She had a sliver, and she intended to shine a beam through it like a blade.\n\nIn the theater\u2019s bowels, something rattled. The magician scowled at his cards as if they had betrayed him. The aerialist was not in a harness and was therefore delighted. The dancer who vomited had a bottle of water and a red mouth as if she\u2019d eaten cherries; she had not.\n\nMaya found Rayna at the edge of the stage and said, \u201cOur health team would like to have the finalists do quick checks, nothing invasive, just keep the flu out of our building. Sorry to be a hall monitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can breathe and hum. I can show them both.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d The health officer, a woman with small glasses and a bigger patience, handed Rayna a thermometer and a form to fill out that asked, in small calm boxes, if she\u2019d had close contact with anyone sick, if she had headaches, if she had been feeling unsafe. Rayna ticked boxes and gave her the kind of smile she saved for women who kept the world from becoming more stupid.\n\nIn the wings, at the curtain, just before the hall opened, someone passed by, too close, the zip of their hoodie catching on the button of her shirt. She felt the fabric tug and then release. The person didn\u2019t apologize. She turned to catch a face and saw only a shoulder, and on the shoulder, a patch in the shape of a skull that was smiling in the wrong way. It wasn\u2019t a note, but it felt like one. She shook it off. She didn\u2019t have time for someone else\u2019s theater.\n\nThe judges walked in, their glow manufactured and real toggle-switching in and out. The room swelled and then settled. Rayna took her place on the tape X. She barely noticed the camera. She barely noticed her own tongue. She noticed the chord under the floor, the city\u2019s hum, her own pulse hitching in sympathy.\n\nShe sang. And even the river held still to listen. For a breath. For a breath and a beat longer. And then it went on being a river, and she went on being a girl with a guitar who looked like a storm in a suit. And in the darkness beyond the lights, someone else moved, closer than they had any right to be, watching as if they had already decided that wanting something meant it belonged to them. She did not know any of that yet. But the world already did. The world had been making room for it, the way it makes room for rain.The judges\u2019 room was colder than the stage like it had a grudge about budgets. A long curve of table, little bottles of water sweating politely, placards with names that meant something to millions and almost nothing to Rayna except for the fact that these were the people who currently held the ladder. They gave her their faces the way TV people do, soft at the edges and sharp where money lived. A woman with a bob that could have been used to slice an apple asked a careful question about authenticity. A man in a sweater the color of an expensive bruise said the word phenomenon like he was frightened of it but flirting anyway. A third judge, the one audiences love the way you love a fire you have the option to walk away from, tilted his head in a way that had made careers and ulcerated stomachs. He smiled without warmth and asked whether she thought the British would welcome an American into their house at the last minute with something like gratitude or something closer to the noise a chair makes when it\u2019s dragged.\n\nRayna kept her hands loose on the neck of the guitar, as if she were holding an animal that trusted her for no reason. She kept her answer honest and showed her teeth only where they made a point. \u201cYou invited me,\u201d she said without starch. \u201cI brought my own plate because I know better than to ask you to pass.\u201d The room laughed or pretended it hadn\u2019t decided yet, which on television is more valuable than laughter because it gives the cameras something to study. They pressed her on backstory, the girl-in-bar-homework, the brothers, the tattoo, the ex at the bus stop who had appealed to security as if security could secure the past from mischief. She gave what she wanted to give and kept the rest like it was cash in her sock. When they dismissed her with smiles and a nod to the fact that she looked \u201ccompellingly British in that shirt,\u201d she let herself enjoy the skate of relief down her spine. It felt like a hand working out a knot that had been a friend so long she\u2019d named it.\n\nMaya was waiting in the corridor with a clutch of producers who all looked at once relieved and caffeinated to the point of prophecy. Up close, Maya\u2019s eyes had the light of a person who could tell you where the nearest fire extinguisher was while also teasing you about your terrible taste in sandwiches. \u201cThey\u2019re happy,\u201d she said, then lower, \u201cHe\u2019ll ask for something messier on air. He can smell boundaries. We\u2019ll keep him at heel.\u201d Tom, who\u2019d been vibrating nearby like a tuning fork that had found purpose, held out a Tupperware full of grapes he had clearly filched from craft services. \u201cGrapes for our champion,\u201d he announced. \u201cGreat for the throat. Terrible if you\u2019re trying to look mysterious while eating them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do mysterious,\u201d Rayna said, popping one, \u201cI do obvious in a way that requires interpretation.\u201d\n\nThey moved through the building like it was a maze designed by someone who\u2019d only ever seen corridors in a film. Every corner had another corner. Every door promised less than it suggested. Maya updated her on schedule, on the camera blocking they\u2019d do tomorrow with the crane shot she had argued for and won and was now pretending she\u2019d always had. \u201cWardrobe after lunch,\u201d she added. \u201cOur sponsor is a brand that thinks tailoring is a religion. They will want to try you in nine different suits to figure out which one permits America to exist without causing offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo any of them involve sleeves,\u201d Rayna said, \u201cor are sleeves considered a moral failure?\u201d\n\n\u201cEngland loves a sleeve,\u201d Maya said, pleased. \u201cWe will ease you into them like a cat into a bath.\u201d\n\nWardrobe was a warehouse of cloth with its own weather system. A woman with tape around her neck and a mouth pencil short enough to count as a weapon slid three jackets onto Rayna\u2019s shoulders in such quick succession the air itself got confused and tried to put on a blazer. The suits were good, in that way things are good when purpose has forethought and money. Blue, of course, appeared not once but four times, in four nearly identical shades that the wardrobe assistant called navy, night, ink, and almost black before catching herself and saying, sorry, midnight. Rayna felt that old prickling along the skin between shoulder and neck when the fourth blue went on and fit too well. It felt like a compliment and a trap. The assistant spun her toward a mirror and smiled at the result like a haircut. \u201cSee?\u201d she said. \u201cNow the internet can thirst without feeling they\u2019ve sinned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would prefer the internet sin,\u201d Rayna replied, and then softened because the woman was only doing her job and doing it with hands that had pinned a hundred hopes into seams. \u201cMidnight is good. But not because some stranger left me a note about it.\u201d The assistant looked up at her in a quick startle and then away, and Rayna wished the sentence back into her mouth even as she knew you could never really swallow a thing like that up again.\n\nSecurity had, in the hours since the hydrangeas, bloomed into a presence you couldn\u2019t ignore. A man the color of boiled coffee shadowed her when she moved between rooms, and a woman with a smile like a seatbelt stood between the green room and the corridor that led to the stage. They all had earpieces and that slight, hummingbird restlessness that comes from being asked to anticipate danger and then being given a hallway full of lunch trays. One of them introduced himself as Kamal, which he said rhymed with \u201ccalm\u201d in a way that made it clear he\u2019d had the joke wrung out of him and still kept offering it because he believed in courtesy like other people believed in saints. \u201cYou\u2019ll see me,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t, I will see you,\u201d which somehow felt more reassuring than anything else had all day.\n\nBetween rehearsal and a camera test they did a sit-down in a too-bright room that had a succulent in the corner looking at them like they were the bad decisions that had brought them to sunlight. The show\u2019s story producer wanted the bar under the table to be raised or lowered depending on how much of the phrase father figure Rayna was willing to tolerate. \u201cCan we talk about your dad?\u201d the woman asked, with that seesaw tone therapists and television people share. \u201cCan we talk about what he was like and whether he was around, and how you coped?\u201d Rayna balanced her heel on the rung of the chair and stared for a second at the tabletop, which had a scratch near the top left corner in the exact shape of Wyoming. She considered saying yes. She considered saying no. She considered telling them about the way her mother had folded in on herself when the little factory hours had been cut and she had filled her pockets with tips that smelled like ketchup and tired men. Instead, she told the story where the bar owner had taught her to play E minor properly because he was sick of watching her pretend she had it. The story was not a lie, and parts of it had tears in their pockets if you knew where to put your fingers. The producer nodded and had the decency not to push. \u201cWe\u2019ll find your other edges another time,\u201d she said. \u201cI have faith in your layers.\u201d\n\nBy late afternoon the city had decided to be damp without the fuss of rain. The river hulked below the window of her room like a thought you keep having even though it makes you feel weird. She stood there with the blue suit draped across a chair back like a person waiting to speak and felt tired in a way that reminded her of school bus mornings, where the air tasted like pennies and the day seemed both promise and dare. She had five minutes before a call with Shiloh to go over some press he\u2019d triaged into good, bad, and weird, and she spent the first four fighting the urge to go downstairs and ask the desk to show her the entry logs. She stayed still. She breathed. She texted Nikki a photo of the suit and a caption that said, I give in to the sleeve lobby, and Nikki wrote back, You look like a storm that pays taxes. Then she sent a photo of Justice asleep on an upside-down grocery bag like a rug he had hunted to death. The laugh that came out of Rayna wasn\u2019t a big one, but it was whole, which is sometimes better.\n\nThe guitar was where she had left it, leaning against the chair like a friend with opinions. She tuned. Or she tried to. Something was off by more than flight and air conditioning. The G string had been loosened to the point of foolishness and the low E had been tuned two steps down with the kind of confidence born of familiarity. Her hands didn\u2019t shake when she found it, but the room felt briefly like it had lost a notch on a hinge, the door swinging too far. She could have done that herself half-asleep, sure. She could have bumped it. She could have imagined she had tightened when she had loosened. She could have been sloppy, since she believed in the resurrection of good hands after long nights. She could, but she hadn\u2019t. When she lifted the guitar, a clean human scent rose from the wood that was not hers. It was faint, a trace of peppermint or maybe eucalyptus. Halls of memory opened in her nose\u2014Rose\u2019s candy in the airplane seat, the way her palms had warmed the wrapper, the way she\u2019d pressed her hand to glass and warned Rayna about a river. She retuned the strings with method. A few turns. A few more. She checked the door even though she always locked it out of muscle rather than worry. The latch clicked like it loved being reliable.\n\nShe called Shiloh and told him the press could write whatever it liked as long as it spelled her name right, and he told her that was how you ended up with shirts silk-screened with Raina and a thousand people calling you a meteor because they can\u2019t bring themselves to say comet. He tried to get her to agree to a breakfast television slot where hosts with teeth like glaciers would offer her baked beans and she\u2019d ask on air whether beans counted as a breakfast food or a Sunday afternoon form of penance. She hedged because her vocal cords drew boundaries that her ambition sometimes tripped over. They argued in the old, comfortable way and ended with him calling her a menace and her calling him a bishop in Guilty Pleasures. Then he said, without humor, \u201cWhoever is sniffing around, I want a name,\u201d and she said she did, too, and when they hung up, she stared at the guitar like it might give it to her if asked nicely.\n\nThe next note didn\u2019t show up in flowers. It was taped to the inside of the elevator, knee-level, where no one with eyes on messages would look first. She didn\u2019t see it until she had started to step out on the stage floor with Kamal a few feet behind her and Tom a few ahead and Maya arranging people by tone and hair light. It was a cheap piece of hotel stationery, the kind you use for grocery lists and apologies you aren\u2019t ready to make. It read: YOU HOLD YOUR PICK TOO TIGHT WHEN YOU\u2019RE LYING. She kept her face polite and bored, because that is how you survive men who like to take credit for knowing you before you do. Kamal saw it the second her eyes did. He did not make the sound a guard makes when he is trying not to make a sound. He took three steps backward without taking his eyes off her and spoke into the air. The elevator doors thumped shut like a mouth that had decided against a story. By the time they reopened, the note was gone and a man in a high-vis vest was holding a roll of tape and explaining to another man about load-bearing capacity as if he\u2019d been there the whole time.\n\n\u201cPeople who do that kind of thing,\u201d Maya said later, in a small office where they pretended the air tasted like calm, \u201cwant to ruin your sense of your own edges. They want you to feel permeable. They want you to check locks that aren\u2019t broken. They want you to mistake vigilance for fatigue. We won\u2019t give them that.\u201d Rayna looked at her and wondered when exactly she had decided to trust this woman with her voice in ways she did not trust herself with her irritation. She nodded like a pact. She said, \u201cOkay,\u201d because sometimes the most useful word in the language is ordinary. The show gave her a minder who was, unlike Kamal, capable of being invisible on demand. She learned his name was Pete on the second day because he\u2019d been introduced as production and then had materialized whenever an elevator opened onto a corridor that wasn\u2019t hers. \u201cIf I do my job right,\u201d he said cheerily, \u201cyou\u2019ll never remember I existed,\u201d which is both a terrible thing to say to someone and the precise thing that made Rayna relax two degrees.\n\nBy the time the day of the camera run arrived, Rayna knew the building\u2019s smell. She knew which corners lived colder than others, which switch panels were sticky with the residue of ten seasons of hands, which stagehands flirted with lighting because they were cowed by sound. She knew where to put her feet when the truss squealed and where to stand so the smoke would catch in the frosted cones just enough to make her halo look like an accident. She wore the midnight suit. She refused a tie because she wanted throat. She let wardrobe tuck her shirt in with affection and impatience. She stood under the kill lights and waited, shoulders down, mouth soft, pick in place but loose, very loose, so loose it could fall without heartache. She didn\u2019t think about the note. She thought about the thing the audience didn\u2019t know they wanted until she gave it to them and the snap in the middle when they went from withholding to throwing themselves at her like she was a lake they\u2019d been dared to jump.\n\nThe camera operator with the crane was a woman with biceps that made Rayna want to do a push-up out of courtesy. \u201cWhen you move there,\u201d she said, tapping a bit of tape shaped like a carelessly applied bandaid, \u201cI catch you across, and we do this flirt, this lazy left, feels like summer. Then we drop. Go again. Again. Beautiful. Don\u2019t do that thing with your jaw. You tighten. It reads as arrogance, and you are arrogant, but not like that.\u201d The operator grinned when she said it. Rayna grinned back and let the note become another reminder to keep her face where she lived it\u2014in that space between invitation and dare.\n\nThe afternoon was a queue. Music, makeup, press who asked if she could pretend to hum something for b-roll and looked like they wanted to applaud when she refused gently because humming on command felt like asking her to be thirsty in public. A boy who made puppets out of cereal boxes lost his glue and cried in a corner and then stopped crying when a sixty-year-old floor manager crouched and handed him scissors with the gravity of a knighted hero. The aerialist did not vomit and looked disappointed in herself for breaking tradition. The magician flicked a coin and told Rayna she had eyes like a bar fight. She didn\u2019t ask him if he meant that kindly. She went outside for five minutes and let London wrap around her. The sky was the color of a bruise that had healed. The river smelled like a penny left in a mouth too long. A gull stole a chip from a boy who had dropped it as bait and seemed genuinely amazed when it worked.\n\nAt the barrier, a family with three kids asked for a photo, and the smallest one, a girl with missing teeth and a sweater that had a dinosaur wearing a scarf, touched the red suspenders peeking out of Rayna\u2019s bag like they were a talisman and then pulled her hand back as if she\u2019d overstepped. \u201cThey\u2019re loud,\u201d the girl said gravely. \u201cMy mum says sometimes loud things are good.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mum is right,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cSometimes loud things tell the truth you can\u2019t get out in a whisper.\u201d\n\nBack inside the building, a runner handed her a garment bag with her name on it in careful block letters. She hadn\u2019t asked for anything, and the sight of her name written by a stranger\u2019s hand made something ancient in her chest go stiff. \u201cWho dropped this?\u201d she asked, and the runner, who was new enough to still look like a deer that had negotiated a ceasefire with traffic, said, \u201cFront desk,\u201d like that explained the world. Rayna took the bag and went into a room where she could pull the zipper down without being a citizen in a public square. Inside was a suit, a twin to the midnight, but blue like a Pool of Bethesda if it had been tailored by someone who understood American shoulders. It was expensive in that shameless way that makes people feel they should look twice. There was no designer tag in the normal place. The label had been unpicked carefully, as if a person had removed evidence with love. In the breast pocket was a small envelope with her name again. The card inside was a miniature of the hotel stationery, like a cousin you\u2019d both forgive. SEE? it read. DON\u2019T PRETEND YOU DIDN\u2019T WANT THIS. WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER. She sat down on the bench without meaning to. The suit watched her. For a moment she imagined putting it on and walking on stage and letting the secret move like silk along her skin. For a moment she imagined what it would feel like to collude. Then she stood and carried the bag to Maya\u2019s office and put it on the desk like evidence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted by the budget,\u201d Maya said dryly because dry was the only option in some kitchens. She didn\u2019t touch the suit. She called in Security. She let her face go flat in a way Rayna hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cWe escalate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will start treating this like a person with access rather than a fan with initiative. We will get the police liaison to stop pretending this is charming.\u201d She looked at Rayna and all the joking left the room. \u201cWe will not use this for ratings,\u201d she added for free, and something in Rayna\u2019s ribcage stood down like a sentry who\u2019d heard the password.\n\nThe rehearsal that evening had teeth. The band felt looser the way good shoes feel when you\u2019ve broken them in and they\u2019ve decided you\u2019re worth forgiving. The lights did the trick with the almost-N flicker so that the word fear kept trying to shed its front and become ear, and under it, in the pit of the room where seats slept waiting for bodies, the sound engineer nodded along as if someone had proven an algebra he\u2019d been arguing with since the nineties. Rayna did not think about the blue suit sitting in a clear plastic bag on a desk like an argument. She did not think about the river or the peppermint or the way the man with the bandage had bumped her shoulder as if she were a door that needed testing. She thought about the line she\u2019d written under that hook weeks ago, the one that unraveled on its own and then returned, shy. She thought about breath. She thought about holding no longer than necessary.\n\nBackstage, in the cheap light, she found the dancer with the red mouth and sat beside her on a trunk that had the grit of decades on it. \u201cYou do that thing,\u201d the dancer said without looking up from wrapping her ankle. \u201cWhen you finish, you don\u2019t throw the last note away, you put it down like a mug in a sink you intend to wash later. My mother does that. Not with notes. With glass.\u201d Rayna laughed because the image repaired something. The dancer glanced up and her eyes sharpened to interest, not hunger. \u201cI\u2019m Lianne,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw up in about three minutes, and then I\u2019m going to rip a hole in that floor.\u201d She squared her shoulders like someone braced on a ship. \u201cYou can stand behind me if you want when the weather comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather stand beside,\u201d Rayna said, and Lianne\u2019s mouth curved like a woman who had just decided on a pair of shoes without asking anyone\u2019s permission. They didn\u2019t exchange numbers. It would have been too much ceremony. They shared the minute, and when Lianne walked away, she did it like she owned her own gravity.\n\nNight was an animal with two heads when she got back to the hotel. One head wanted sleep, heavy and uncomplicated. The other wanted a walk, to shake the footprint of the day off like a dog in water. She compromised by going downstairs and standing just under the awning with a tea that had been made by someone who could steep a bag without murdering it. The doorman from earlier gave her a look that was part amusement, part concern. \u201cIt\u2019s a river night,\u201d he said conversationally, as if the Thames had moods like a teenager, \u201cthe kind where it\u2019ll pull on your shoelaces if you stand too close.\u201d She smiled at the superstition and took two steps back without making it a thing. Her phone buzzed. Unknown number, local. The voicemail that followed was briefly a pocket and then a voice, a man\u2019s, pitched pleasant, like a disc jockey in the wrong decade. \u201cYou\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be boring now.\u201d There was a clink in the background, glass on wood maybe, maybe an ice bucket being misused. Then a soft little sound she couldn\u2019t place because the phone\u2019s microphone made sands of certain noises. She didn\u2019t save it. She recorded the number and handed it to Kamal in the morning like a spare part.\n\nLondon did what cities do and carried on effervescing. The morning showed up with a face like it didn\u2019t owe anyone anything. Tom brought her a list of last-minute changes in margins too small for human eyes and read them out loud anyway because he liked to hear his own competence in the air. The open came earlier. The camera in the wings had died a little death and been resurrected by someone who called all cameras she and patted them like horses. A comedian from Leeds made a joke that offended a nation and then apologized ten seconds later in a way that offended another. Maya grew a second pen behind her ear and rewrote reality on notecards without breaking eye contact with anyone.\n\nAn hour before the dress rehearsal, Shiloh texted a screenshot from a forum Rayna had promised herself she would never read. A thread title in fonts so ugly that they felt like an affront read: WHO IS A. BOWMAN? The posters argued like families in kitchens. Some said the name belonged to an agent who had once run a scam where he sold people their own faith back at a markup. Others said it was a producer from a smaller show whose contestants had had flowers left at their doors and who had, three months into it, fled the industry to open a shop in Kent that sold jam and resentment. One post was a photo of a wristwatch caught in a mirror, the kind with a thin black band and a chip in the crystal at two o\u2019clock, and underneath the photo someone had written: look for this. Shiloh\u2019s message underneath the screenshot said, before you say anything, I\u2019m on it, and also, do not go anywhere alone, which made her want to go everywhere alone immediately because she was perverse and because fear sometimes wears the mask of endurance and calls itself independence.\n\nShe allowed the suit jacket to sit on her shoulders like it had been born there. She allowed the shirt to be buttoned, the collar to be coaxed, the hair to be tilted on purpose in a way that would read well from the mezzanine. She took her guitar from its case and inhaled the warm-wood smell that had become as familiar to her as any childhood kitchen. She checked the frets with her thumb the way she always did, small, secret intimacies between object and hand. When she stepped into the wings, the auditorium looked like a sea bed again, waiting for something to chime. A runner whispered into the air that they were at a five, which meant less than five and also more than five, depending on who you asked. Lianne passed her, eyes bright like someone who had looked their nerves in the face and patted them on the head. \u201cBeside,\u201d she said, and Rayna nodded, and for a second the whole enterprise felt like a science experiment they might pull off without blowing up the lab.\n\nAt two, with the orchestra under the stage tuning itself into one shared breath, Tom pressed something into her palm. It was small and round and cool\u2014the lucky coin she\u2019d written on her list and then forgotten in her desk drawer in Los Angeles. She blinked up at him. He shrugged like a man pleased by his own theft. \u201cNikki mailed it, same-day, at a cost that could have bought a small horse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came at reception twenty minutes ago with a note that calls me an angel and says you\u2019re not to get sappy about it because she\u2019ll die of secondhand sentiment. I took the liberty of screening it,\u201d he added lightly, which was a joke that wasn\u2019t a joke. \u201cNo other stowaways in the envelope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my favorite flu,\u201d Rayna told him, and he blushed at the absurdity. She slid the coin into the watch pocket she never used and felt the taste of home like sugar at the back of the mouth. The floor manager held up fingers. Three. Then two. Then one. The audience in dress was a fiction telling the truth loudly. The cameras woke like animals with good training. The universe tightened itself so it wouldn\u2019t leak. Rayna walked to her mark and the mic found her mouth and she thought of a woman in a plane seat pressed against a window, a chorus girl ghosting the glass, whispering about a river, and she thought of a boy in Manchester writing a letter that made his own heart tap like a moth. She thought of her mother\u2019s hands rinsing a glass until it shone and of Nikki\u2019s voice bending like a spoon where laughter got too big. She thought of a blue suit with its tag unpicked sitting like a dare in an office. She thought of the red suspenders in her bag waiting like old trouble. She thought of the way a city can take what you haven\u2019t decided and hold it up so you have to look.\n\nAnd then she sang. She sang as if the room had a secret and the only way to get it to tell was to offer it a better one. She sang the way she breathed when she forgot to be nice about it. She saw somewhere in the movement of the dark audience a shoulder that might have been any shoulder and a glint on a wrist that could have been glass or a chip in a crystal at two. She did not let her hand tighten on the pick. She let it sit like a bird that could fly away if it wanted, and trusted that it, like everything else worth keeping, would understand that staying is a choice you make again and again and again.\n\nAfter, the room bled applause in the way rooms do when everyone is glad to be made into one animal. Backstage, Lianne laughed without sound and bumped her hip into Rayna\u2019s hip like girls on a playground. Maya squeezed her forearm, hard, quick, and then went to put out the next, inevitable fire. Kamal materialized and did a sweep of the corridor with his eyes that would have missed nothing. A runner tripped, then righted herself and kept going with the stamina of a saint and the language of a sailor. Somewhere, the magician swore because a coin had done the one thing coins are known for not doing. Somewhere else, a child sang along to a hook she hadn\u2019t known she knew. In the dressing room, the suit\u2014her suit, the one she had chosen, not the one someone had chosen for her\u2014hung straight-backed on its hanger like a soldier at ease.\n\nOn the table, beside the flowers the production had delivered with the kind of card that is mostly names in markers, was a small square blue box tied with white ribbon. Nobody had seen it come in. No one ever sees presents arrive until they\u2019ve arrived. There was no note visible. She didn\u2019t touch it. She sat and drank water and told herself a story about patience that she almost believed. Then she took out her phone and took a photo of the box and sent it to Maya and to Kamal and to Shiloh with the caption, we\u2019re opening this together, because she had learned something about together in rooms like this and because the river outside took what it wanted, and she\u2019d decided, for now, to want only what she could still hold after the tide had turned.Chapter Five\n\nThey did not open the box like people on television open things, with gasps that cue an audience to gasp too. They opened it the way you open a letter from a person you might love who has also disappointed you, with care that felt like suspicion and politeness that had steel in it. Maya waited until Kamal was in the doorway and Pete had shut it with that soft click he had mastered as if doors obeyed gentleness. She pulled the ribbon cleanly rather than untying it, because knotted cord made Rayna think of wrists. The lid lifted and the smell came first, not flowers this time, not lilac or pepper, but the crisp sweet of peppermint, the kind Rose had pressed into Rayna\u2019s palm like a communion. Inside was a tin, old-fashioned, enamel worn at the edges the way a mouth wears down the inside of a cheek. Under it, nested in tissue that had been folded with someone\u2019s attention, lay a watch. It was slim, plain, the kind a person buys who believes in time as a discipline rather than jewelry as a sign. At two o\u2019clock, the crystal had that tiny crescent wound, not enough to keep the hands from moving, enough to remind anyone looking that something once hit it where you could see. The strap was black and narrow, one loop stretched thin like a person who had tugged at it when thinking.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not touch anything we don\u2019t have to,\u201d Maya said, and the restraint in her voice made Rayna\u2019s throat ache with gratitude and rage at the same time. Kamal took photos with a phone that looked like it had been armored in a previous life, angles like evidence, not like memory. Pete handed Maya a pair of gloves he had not had in his pocket ten seconds earlier and she put them on like a surgeon about to reach for a heart. Under the watch, under the peppermint tin, there was a card cut to the size of the box bottom. BLOCK CAPS again, the handwriting that had decided it didn\u2019t want personality now that it wanted power. TIME IS WHAT WE MAKE OF IT, it read. DON\u2019T WASTE OURS. WE ARE NEARER THAN YOU THINK. The plural was an affectation or a threat or both. Rayna felt her jaw hinge go tight and she made it loose again because she had been told twice since arriving in this building that her jaw told stories she did not want to tell for free.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the chip,\u201d she said, because naming a thing made part of it smaller. \u201cFrom the forum Shiloh sent. It\u2019s him or a very committed imitator.\u201d\n\nMaya tapped the tin lightly with one finger in its glove and the clink sounded like the start of a song you didn\u2019t want to hear. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to see this,\u201d she offered, but Rayna shook her head, because not seeing was another kind of claim, and she would not give this nameless thing more than it had already taken. The tin came open with the small resistance of a lid that had lived in a pocket, over and over. Inside, instead of candy, were three guitar picks, black, tortoiseshell, blue. The blue had been sanded at one edge the way she sometimes sanded her own so they caught strings in the right way. On the back of the tortoiseshell one, someone had carved a word with something sharp. LOOSEN. The O had been cut too deep, the groove white where the dye had failed to reach. She felt her hand close without meaning to and then breathe itself open because a muscle trained is a muscle saved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get the police liaison up here now,\u201d Maya said, and when she spoke to someone on her phone, she didn\u2019t say please, but it grew in the gap where it would have usually gone, like a child hearing the word in the way the sentence softened without it. \u201cWe\u2019ll run prints off the tin if he was arrogant, which he is,\u201d she added without inflection. \u201cWe\u2019ll check vendor lists again for entry points. We\u2019ll pull the roster for day staff and night staff, and then we\u2019ll pull the roster for people we think we know and pretend we don\u2019t. Kamal, please station someone in the lift banks. Pete, you\u2019re shadowing to the bathroom and back. No one goes anywhere alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cCopy,\u201d Kamal said in a voice as calm as a glass of milk, and it was that domestic calm that kept Rayna from kicking the table just to hear something break.\n\nThe liaison arrived with a notebook and the air of a man who had been friendly for so long that he could be rude without anyone noticing. He asked questions in neat lines and gave nothing away from his face but the occasional glance toward the box like the peppermint smell had reminded him of a time he wished he hadn\u2019t remembered. \u201cAnonymous gift-giving escalates or it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said, which was not helpful and also true. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep a presence in public spaces. We\u2019ll liaise with hotel security. We\u2019ll speak to props about the watch\u2014retro, common enough, but that chip is unusual. We\u2019ll be dull where we can be, which is the point.\u201d It was the kind of speech that made people less afraid without making them stupid, and Rayna liked him for it in spite of herself.\n\nAfter he left with the box in a clear bag that looked like a joke about evidence, Maya stayed leaning on the desk for one extra breath, her head tipped back as if she were considering asking the ceiling for help. \u201cI hate this part of the job,\u201d she said, and the frankness of it was another small mercy. \u201cWe build stories out of people. We invite the world to watch them build themselves. And some watcher always mistakes watching for owning. I would like to find a door we can shut that feels like a door, not a curtain.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me go on,\u201d Rayna replied, meaning the stage, meaning the thing that made sense when nothing else did. \u201cLet me make it loud enough that whatever hiss he likes to make sounds small. I don\u2019t want him in here when I\u2019m singing,\u201d she added, and her hand hovered over her chest for a second like an absent-minded saint.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe in here,\u201d Maya said, not as a promise she had no right to give, but as intention said out loud to make it more real. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not alone in here. That matters.\u201d\n\nIt should have been enough to sit with other people and let the room have its hum until the part of her that had been braced unclenched. It almost was. Tom appeared with a bowl of pasta that had steamed through its lid and said he had threatened caterers with public shaming if they dared to send kale instead of carbohydrate. Lianne slid in with a water bottle covered in stickers so battered they had become abstract art and talked about ankles like a person who could recite the names of bones in her sleep. Shiloh, on video, did his trick where he looked into the camera like a man in a painting and promised he would set the internet on fire if anyone printed a single line that made Rayna into a archetype without permission. The world had arranged itself around her in the shape of a net woven by people who had to be tugged and fed and told jokes; it would hold if she let it. The trouble was that once a river decides to drag at your shoelaces, you became aware of your own knots.\n\nThey ran the dress, and the band came up under her like a bodyguard who knew when to step back and when to push someone with elbows. The lights did their flicker trick perfectly which meant they would be petulant later, because lights were like that. The audience in their borrowed enthusiasm did the gasp they had been given to do, and the cameras caught her at the angle the crane operator had promised. In her in-ear, the engineer\u2019s voice murmured numbers, then disappeared the way he was supposed to, a ghost who haunted softly so everyone else could believe in miracles. Halfway through her second song, in the place where her throat opened without her asking, a breath that was not her own hissed in her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t be boring,\u201d it said, the same pleasant wrongness as the voicemail, and for a millimeter of a second, her hand did what it had been warned not to do; it closed. She felt the pick shift and then steadied it with a breath so deliberate it disguised itself as nothing at all. She finished the phrase. She finished the song. She took her pack off in a motion that told none of the audience that she wanted to throw it at a wall, and she handed it to the sound tech with a smile that belonged to stage wives and assassins. \u201cNot yours,\u201d she said quietly, and the engineer went flat and furious in the way of a man who had just realized his house had been burgled while he was making tea in the kitchen.\n\nThey traced the interference to a small patch cable that had not been patched by any of their people. It had been left plugged into a splitter in a rack no one touched if they wanted to live. It was the sort of clever that belonged to someone who knew enough about sound to be arrogant about it without knowing enough to not get caught. The engineer, whose name badge said Jo and whose eyebrows had done all the heavy lifting of expression for years, actually said the words, \u201cHow dare you,\u201d to the metal box like it had a soul. Kamal and a man from Facilities whose name no one ever learned took the cable away under their shirts as if it might be shy of exposure. Pete moved from right shoulder to left in a way that put himself between Rayna and the biggest openings to the room. Maya wrote something on her notepad and ripped the page off to hand it to Security, the rip neat as a verdict.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s touching the rack, he\u2019s registered somewhere,\u201d Jo said, and the quiet in their voice had weight. \u201cOr he thinks he\u2019s invisible, which means he always wanted to be seen more than he says he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Rayna loved Jo in that second the way you love anyone who turns a thought into a dragnet and gets ready to pull.\n\nThe show, like any machine built by a hundred hands, shrugged and kept moving. Lianne came back from her piece with her hair glued to her neck and a look that said she\u2019d paid on time. The magician made the coin reappear inside a lemon and didn\u2019t break the fourth wall except to grin at a child in the front row like they shared a secret that didn\u2019t involve citrus. The aerialist did not get tangled, and the floor manager did a small fist pump in the wing like a man allowing himself a single sin. Time moved the way it moves in theaters, elastic and bossy. Rayna did what she always did when the hum got too loud; she went quiet inside and checked her hands. They were steady now. The tremor had moved somewhere else\u2014into the way she wanted a cigarette although she hadn\u2019t smoked since twenty-five, into the itch along her scalp that meant a fight or a kiss or a song. She drank water and, for once, didn\u2019t want to spit it out because it tasted like television.\n\nWhen they let her go for an hour, the river had turned itself the color of pewter and thought about being still. Pete did the sideways walk while pretending to be behind, and Kamal did the ahead thing that made people split for him like bread. It was too much to ask to be alone; it would have been a luxury for someone with fewer eyes on her body. She walked with them anyway, and they were such different men it made her like them more, a pair of commas instead of a parenthesis around her. On the bridge, rain started the way British rain likes to start, as gossip rather than news. A man with a buggy that squeaked as if it needed forgiveness hustled past; a woman in a coat that had a waistline as arrogant as an old movie looked across at the Eye and sighed like the Swan Boats in Boston had disappointed her personally. Rayna did the thing she wasn\u2019t supposed to and stopped in the middle to look down at the water. She held the stone with one hand, not as if it would save her if she fell, but as if she were taking its temperature.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s close enough,\u201d Kamal said without the scold and with the implication. \u201cI don\u2019t tell you not to sing. You won\u2019t tell me not to keep you out of cold water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said, and the smile she gave him was the sort good bartenders collect like tips. \u201cBut I will ask if you believe in rivers that choose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in men who use rivers to excuse their own appetites,\u201d he said mild as milk again, and that was the thing that pulled her back from the edge as effectively as if he had put a hand on her elbow.\n\nThe pep rally for press afterward had the feel of a school gym that had been convinced to wear a suit. Rayna did not let any one voice in her ear become louder than her own. She said things about honoring stages and loving live audiences and the honor of being asked to leap across an ocean to be booed in a different accent. She let the host with the glacier teeth make his joke about Americans and volume and then made a better one that didn\u2019t care if he wanted it. She went upstairs and lay on the carpet again and stared up at the ceiling and let the texture blur until it had stopped looking like something and started looking like a thousand someones from a distance. She didn\u2019t sleep. She pretended to sleep. When her phone rang, she answered before the second buzz and said, \u201cYou are not allowed to die before tomorrow,\u201d which was how Nikki said hello when she was anxious and which made Nikki laugh on the other end so hard she snorted.\n\n\u201cI mailed you something else because apparently my love language is making couriers earn their keep,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not opening it until someone with a badge says it\u2019s boring. Also, I\u2019m watching from two in the morning with a thermos and a cat who thinks British accents are a personal attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cJustice is xenophobic,\u201d Rayna said, and the banality of the sentence was medicine. \u201cI will wear the suspenders you sent me, but only if I can hide them under the suit like a secret only the camera won\u2019t get if it behaves.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Nikki said immediately. \u201cWear your old trouble like an amulet. That way if the blue shows up, it\u2019s on your terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always on my terms,\u201d Rayna said, and the sentence had a spine. \u201cTell my mother I ate.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s on the other line,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cShe heard herself in your throat on that call where you said you were okay. She put the phone down and cried and then picked it up and made a list of soups. She\u2019s back to soups, baby. We\u2019re saved.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you were here,\u201d Rayna said in a voice low enough that if anyone had been standing in the doorway they would have had to step inside to hear it.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Nikki said, and then she was gone because time zones and attention spans are laws too.\n\nMorning was a machine with many switches. They flipped all of them. Hair, face, throat, hands. Tom appeared with a small bag of raw ginger and a look that said he had fought a dragon in a produce aisle, and Maya appeared with a walkie clipped to a pocket that had started to sag from responsibility. The doorman downstairs said the river was being good today and then shook his head because he felt like he had invited it to be bad by naming it. The liaison checked in and said there had been a man who had tried to flirt with a camera operator by pretending to know her rig and had disappeared when she had asked a question about sensor size. They were reviewing footage. They were talking to Facts rather than Feelings, which was exactly how it should be and also never enough.\n\nIn the hall, someone had taped a new sign over the old one that said Stage Left. The new one said Left, Love, in someone else\u2019s handwriting, the kind that wasn\u2019t afraid of itself. Rayna laughed because superstition needed to be fed sometimes and that was a kindness. She put the coin in its place. She stood at the tape cross that had become hers the way a place becomes yours simply by the fact of your body holding it often enough, and she rolled her shoulders and she let her mouth relax on the vowels she always rushed. Jo\u2019s voice in her ear was the right shape again, nothing added. She saw Lianne in the wing, bent forward, arms long, the shape dancers have when they are saying sorry to physics and getting away with it. She saw Maya at the monitor, still as if she had roots somewhere and could afford to stop moving for a second. She saw Kamal where he always was, in the place where problems start if they\u2019re going to start, wearing patience like a uniform under the uniform.\n\nThe host said her name in the shape London made it, flat and respectful and a little skeptical, as if it were sure it would be won over but wanted to make her earn it. The crowd opened their mouths like birds taught that sound was food and she threw a piece of herself to them and they caught it and didn\u2019t tear each other apart for it, which is always a small miracle when it happens. She took a breath. The first chord hit like a door shut without anger. Her voice came, and it came the way she had promised herself it would, not borrowed, not bought, hers, the thing she had kept when other things had been lifted. She watched the first row turn into a second and a third and then blur into heat. The crane swung left lazy as summer and she looked up into it like she was flirting with the sun because the operator liked to say that was what she was doing anyway. The bridge arrived, the one that had failed and succeeded enough times that it had a knot in the middle like a healed bone, and she stepped into it with her eyes open and her hands sure.\n\nSomewhere, at the ragged edge of the darkness, a single face came into too much focus and then away. A man whose age could have been anything between thirty and forty because he had the kind of face that had made a habit of being no one, hair cut short because scissors were cheap, skin the gray-pink of a person who lives indoors. He wore a jacket that at first looked like crew and then didn\u2019t if you knew where to look. At his wrist, when he raised it to scratch the back of his head as if he were simply listening, light caught and broke on the glass where two o\u2019clock lived. He smiled in the way skull patches smile when whoever designed them forgot that grins are about teeth and eyes and the skin around them, not just the idea of a mouth. She did not tighten. She did not flinch. She let the note come out of her mouth and placed it down like a mug she intended to wash later. It was only when she hit the last consonant that the part of her that wasn\u2019t singing took his picture with a part of her that didn\u2019t need a camera to remember.\n\nBackstage, oxygen did what it does when rooms have been taught to applaud. Everyone clapped each other\u2019s backs because clapping is contagious behind the scenes, not because anyone needs the noise, but because bodies need to do something with the charge that isn\u2019t shouting. Maya did the forearm squeeze, and Tom went to fetch the thing he had forgotten to fetch the minute he\u2019d been told not to forget it, and Jo removed Rayna\u2019s pack with tenderness that would have embarrassed them both if either of them had been the sort of person who embarrassed. Lianne grinned with all her teeth and then, because she had ritual, went to a small bin and threw up cleanly and came back looking like the kind of saint who doesn\u2019t believe in suffering for its own sake.\n\nThere was a moment, just before the winners\u2019 music, where the hall shifted and the world leaned to the left the way it does when you\u2019re on a boat and the shoreline proves itself to be something you can touch. The liaison appeared in the wing and made a face like he had bitten a lemon that proved his point. He held up a hand with a small plastic card pinched between forefinger and thumb. It was a pass, laminate corners nicked, lanyard frayed the way fabric frays when it lives around necks that sweat. The name block read ANDREW BOWMAN in ghosted capitals and underneath, in smaller letters, the word Lighting. The photo had been taken by someone who didn\u2019t like taking photos; the man in it stared at an off-place dot like he hoped it would tell him what to feel. In the picture, the watch face was not visible, but you could see the shadow of a strap near the cuff. The liaison\u2019s eyebrows went up, question living there without being asked. Kamal\u2019s mouth did not move, but the yes in the line of his neck was a knot waved loose.\n\n\u201cFound where?\u201d Maya said softly, and the liaison\u2019s mouth answered with three words and a gesture that meant too much information and not enough. Back corridor. Fuse cupboard. Again. The again was a weight they all felt. They did not cartwheel. They did not collapse. They all took a breath at the same time as if someone had called out one-two-three in a game that had borrowed its rules from combat drills.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting clever,\u201d Maya said quietly enough that only the four of them heard it. \u201cWe\u2019re getting safe, and then we\u2019re getting boring, and then later maybe I will allow myself the luxury of saying out loud that I am angry. For now, we will walk her to the panel. We will get her off the stage. And we will let the cops do their job without inviting them to do mine.\u201d She looked at Rayna and let her face soften for exactly one second. \u201cYou were not boring,\u201d she added, as if the haunter had been the one to set the assignment.\n\nThey moved. The cameras were back on, and the room did that thing where it thinks it is part church, part casino, part high school assembly, depending on which camera is looking at it. The host made his filler noise. The judges gave pronouncements dressed up as insight, and Rayna listened with her head cocked just enough to communicate affection without surrender. The crowd made the sound a crowd makes when it wants to be part of the decision and also wants to be told what it has decided. It was a relief to have a thing like scores, like numbers a person could hold in their hand and then argue with later at a kebab truck. It was a relief to let herself be one person among many, instead of one person against the dark.\n\nThe verdicts landed where they landed. Some landed with a thunk, some with a cheer that sounded like it could have been recorded last year and played now and no one would know the difference. When she was permitted to leave her mark, she did so without looking back into the house because that is how you keep from making eye contact with ghosts. In the corridor, her hands shook and she let them and then told them that was enough. Pete did the thing where he told a joke that was only funny because of how flat he made it, and Kamal pointed out the quickest route to a room with a door that had a lock that actually made a noise when you turned it. Inside that small square of safety, the midnight suit on its hanger had turned into the kind of blue night sometimes does when it remembers to be tender. The suspenders lay in the bag like a dare with old lipstick on it. On the table, where the blue box had been, there was nothing now but a bottle of water and the card from wardrobe that listed what garment went with what in a handwriting that had kind curves. For a second, she allowed herself to feel lucky in the ordinary way of a person who likes their shoes and has a key that fits and knows they will go to sleep and wake up and have a voice tomorrow that feels like theirs. For a second, the river outside could have been any river where lovers meet and children drop sticks to see which one wins and old men piss into it and pretend they\u2019ve hit the sea.\n\nThe knock on the door was gentle enough that she would have missed it if she\u2019d been singing to herself. She wasn\u2019t. She heard it. She looked at Kamal and he looked at the door and then at her and then opened it two inches with his body a piece of architecture in the gap. Tom peered around his arm like a periscope. \u201cPost-show snack,\u201d he announced, and the relief of it made the room lighter by a measurable degree. \u201cAnd a note from someone with manners for once,\u201d he added, holding up a card with a ribbon that had been tied by a person who understood bows. Inside, in looping, ordinary cursive that belonged to a real hand that had probably written report cards or lists of guests at weddings, someone had written: You were beautiful. From Rose, row F, seat 12. Peppermints soon. The laugh that punched through her chest was clean. She took the note and kissed it because she damned well could. She tucked it into her pocket with the coin. She ate a sandwich like someone who had survived a small battle and wasn\u2019t too proud to count chewing as a victory.\n\nLater, when the building had started to empty itself of noise, the liaison came back with the part of his face that did expressing wearing a shape that could have been hope\u2019s cousin. \u201cWe have a conversation with someone,\u201d he said, and the cautious plural did not feel like the other man\u2019s plural, the one in the notes. \u201cWe might be very bored tomorrow,\u201d he added, and when he smiled, finally, it was tired and human and made his eyes look like someone had decided to stand down from a post and go home for dinner. Maya didn\u2019t clap. No one clapped. It felt like winning a point in a match that had more sets than any of them had understood. It felt like a pause in a piece rather than its end, but a pause that had let breath back into the room.\n\nOn the way back to the hotel, past the river that had decided to play quiet after all, Rayna leaned her head against the cold of the car window and let her breath fog the glass the way Rose\u2019s hand had fogged it at thirty thousand feet. She drew a line in the fog with her finger without meaning to and the line curved itself into a treble clef because her hand had habits. She thought about boys from Manchester and girls under bridges and women who write notes in neat cursive because their hands learned early that kindness is legible when you spell it. She thought about blue and red and midnight and the colors in between that no one bothers to name because they don\u2019t make good paint chips. She thought about the watch ticking somewhere in a plastic bag and a peppermint tin that had nothing sweet in it, and she thought about the old man in corduroy who had smelled like good cigars and old notebooks, and she thought about her mother rinsing out soup pots like they owed her money. She thought about Nikki\u2019s cat on a grocery bag with his eyes half-closed as if he could see all the way to London and had decided to forgive it for existing only because she was in it.\n\nIn the lobby, the doorman nodded like he had been keeping watch for her specifically, which he probably had because some jobs make you pay that kind of attention whether you meant to or not. In the lift, the mirror was kinder than some mirrors. On her floor, the carpet remembered her steps. In her room, the river showed its back like a dog that had decided it could sleep now. On the desk, under the lamp that had the particular shade of yellow hotels prefer because it makes everyone look more like themselves and less like a television star caught in a storm, there was another square box. White this time, no ribbon, no note visible. Her chest went cold and then good sense came back with its coat on. She didn\u2019t touch it. She called Maya. She called Kamal. She took a photo and sent it. Then, because she had decided what kind of person she wanted to be in rooms like this, she pulled the chair away from the desk, sat with her back to the river, and began to tune her guitar one more time, slowly, methodically, E to E, Andrew to A. She let the sound fill the room until the walls remembered who lived there now. She stayed with it. She did not rush. When the door opened and the two of them came in with their tired and their competence, she did not stop. \u201cI will finish this,\u201d she said the way you tell a patient you will finish the stitch you\u2019ve started rather than leaving them half-closed. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll see what\u2019s inside.\u201d She played the last string true and let it ring out, the note sitting on the table between the three of them like something alive. Then she set the guitar down, stood up, and reached for the box with both hands.Chapter Seven\n\nThe lid came up and the room didn\u2019t explode. It sighed. Tissue parted with the small dry hush of a good secret. Inside lay a metal tube of glue with a red cap and a label that announced in earnest sans serif that it could hold soles and souls to their proper places. Beside it: a stout needle curved like a decision, a card of waxed thread the color of asphalt after rain, two rectangles of leather punched for stitching, a bone folder smooth from being handled by hands that took care, and a note in Nikki\u2019s cantankerous print that had gotten prettier only because she had made it practice, not because she cared.\n\nGlue your inner life, she\u2019d written. Also, fix the damn shoe. PS: Peppermints are a gateway drug. PPS: I will personally fight any man with a watch.\n\nRayna\u2019s laugh broke clean in her throat, scandalizing the heat of her own chest. The relief in the room was not dramatic; it was honest. Maya let her shoulders fall a millimeter and then made them professional again. Kamal leaned, peered in as if he were an art critic considering a relic, and gave a single nod like a guard signing for a delivery he had ordered without remembering. Pete made a small noise that might have been happiness and might have been the muscles around his eyes remembering how to move.\n\n\u201cThis is my favorite kind of weapon,\u201d Maya said dryly. \u201cOne that fixes and does not break. Who sends cobbler kits anymore? Nikki is either a witch or a Girl Scout from an alternate timeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s both.\u201d Rayna picked up the bone folder and ran her thumb along its edge. It was such a reasonable object it made her tongue taste like good sense. \u201cAnd she\u2019s right. My shoe is preaching surrender.\u201d She lifted the offender, the left one with the shy mouth at the toe, and set the kit on the table like a ritual. \u201cGive me five minutes,\u201d she said, which, in a world organized by other people\u2019s minutes, was a small rebellion and a bigger prayer. They gave her ten, because sometimes the kindness you can offer is an extra measure of time.\n\nShe patched quietly, the way you speak to a child you shamed by rushing him. The glue had that solvent bite that could get a person high if they were sloppy; she used it the way her mother had used bleach, with respect and a window open. The needle pushed through leather like a little ship insisting on its river. Thread ran sure because it had been waxed to obey. The act of repair shifted something inside her. It was not subtle. It was also not performance. She pressed the seam with the bone tool and imagined her sternum getting the same attention, old gesture lines smoothed until the surface looked more like itself.\n\n\u201cShoemaker, heal thy walking,\u201d Tom said from the doorway where he had come with a schedule and stayed for the sacrament. He did not deserve to be that pleased with himself. He wasn\u2019t, not really. He swallowed the next pun politely and held out his phone with an apologetic glance. \u201cPolice liaison,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have news that will be hours old by the time it hits anyone else\u2019s ears.\u201d\n\nThe liaison looked less carved from public service and more like a man with a sister who\u2019d taught him how to braid hair while they watched television. \u201cWe have him,\u201d he said, skipping a preface because he could tell what would serve. \u201cAndrew Bowman. Freelance lighting. Worked a load-in three seasons ago on a sponsor event, enough to talk his way past people who believe in their own memories. Caught him near the fuse cupboard again, this time with a lanyard he\u2019d altered and a pocket full of treats that are not treats. He has a story. They always do. Yours is that he was \u2018assisting\u2019 and you weren\u2019t listening.\u201d He glanced down at his notes to lift a quote. \u201c\u2018You Americans,\u2019\u201d he read in the mild voice of a man who had heard every version of every bad sentence, \u201c\u2018you want things to be obvious. Art isn\u2019t obvious. I was giving her shape.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShape,\u201d Maya said, flat as paper. \u201cHe used a word like shape while holding a counterfeit pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says the watch is his gift to himself,\u201d the liaison continued, passing over a detail without daring it to get bigger. \u201cHe will insist the peppermint tin belonged to his grandmother and the picks are a professional courtesy. He says \u2018we\u2019 to sound less alone. We have precisely one Andrew Bowman,\u201d he added, and the plural changed character entirely when he said it, more useful, less threat.\n\n\u201cCharges?\u201d Kamal asked, already doing math with the unsexy variables of a city and a show and a building that had too many doors.\n\n\u201cWe have him on trespass. We have him on tampering with equipment. We likely have him on harassment if you are willing to sign.\u201d The liaison kept his voice in the place where choice lives. \u201cThe rest is a story. Stories can carry weight. They don\u2019t always carry court.\u201d\n\n\u201cSign,\u201d Maya said, looking at Rayna with the question visible anyway, and Rayna didn\u2019t need the word.\n\n\u201cSign,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not building an altar in his honor. I\u2019m building a fence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a stage,\u201d the liaison said, and smiled once so she could see he knew the difference.\n\nThe machine did what machines do; it absorbed new facts and kept turning. The final bore down like a train you could see for miles that still took you by surprise when it was suddenly the only thing in your field of view. Wardrobe did their liturgy with chalk and pins. The midnight suit hung on its hanger with the kind of patience that belonged to older cities. The red suspenders lay in the bag under the chair, and every time Rayna walked past she could feel them calling her name the way old temptations put on new excuses. She told Maya she wanted to wear them under the jacket, not as a costume, but as a scaffolding. Maya\u2019s smile bent toward feral and then straightened. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I tell a sponsor who believes in muted tones,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cBut it is what I tell myself, and it\u2019s what I tell you. Put your dare where it will keep your spine honest.\u201d\n\nThey ran through camera positions the way a pilot runs through checklists; competent people saying the same words in the same order because that is how you keep a thing from becoming chaos. Jo said good morning in her ear and her voice did not crackle with the interference of someone else\u2019s arrogance. The magician had put the lemon away because Maya had frowned at citrus and then relented because the lemon had a booking. Lianne stretched long as a promise and then shorter as if she had decided the floor must be seduced and not stunned. Tom bit into a biscuit with the face of a man having an affair with sugar and then offered half around like an apology to the gods of fiber.\n\nAn hour before call, they fed them to press. The questions wore the same suits they always wear but had cleaner collars because finals bring out the starch in everyone. Are you here to win? Are you here to be seen? What will America think? What will London think of what America thinks? Rayna did the trick she had learned: tell one true thing that sounds like two and smile like nobody has earned your bashfulness. \u201cI\u2019m here to do a thing only I can do,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here to see if a room can hold it.\u201d She did not say, I\u2019m here to learn whether fear tastes different in a different country because the journalist from Yorkshire would have turned it into a headline about therapy when all it was was breath with corners.\n\nWhen she lifted her head in the lobby afterward, she saw Rose arranged like a secret on a sofa that had been designed to behave like a riverbank. The older woman looked brighter somehow, as if the city\u2019s light had decided to try itself on her skin. She wore a coat the color of a robin\u2019s egg and had a small paper bag tucked neat beside her like a countrywoman guarding cakes on a train. \u201cYou are busier than I am,\u201d Rose said by way of greeting. \u201cI had to tell a young man in a baseball cap a sentence so sharp and true that he apologized on behalf of all his hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have paid to see that,\u201d Rayna said, sitting down in the space Rose made the way people make space for their own, instinct, without mathematics. \u201cYou came. You said you would.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not like to lie unless there is a good punchline,\u201d Rose said, and handed over the bag. Peppermints, hoarded, wrapped inside their own crinkle symphony. \u201cFor the church,\u201d she added, nodding toward the building without irony.\n\n\u201cThey caught him,\u201d Rayna said after a beat because she wasn\u2019t about to feed the river of rumor, but she would tell truth to the woman who had told her about water that takes and keeps. \u201cThe person who wanted my show to belong to him before it belonged to me. At least, they caught one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they did,\u201d Rose said with the certainty of a woman who has survived stubborn without becoming it. \u201cMen like that always forget the difference between being seen and being watched. It\u2019s the forgetting that makes them sloppy. Forgive me if I am unkind,\u201d she added, and her eyes had pity in them that did not contradict the steel. \u201cI like to be unkind sometimes because it keeps my kindness honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve earned all your adjectives,\u201d Rayna said. She tucked the mints in her breast pocket the way a soldier tucks letters. \u201cRose, if I look at the river tonight and it looks back, what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018I know you,\u2019\u201d Rose said promptly, \u201cand then you turn away before it thinks it has won.\u201d\n\nThe day gathered itself. Sound check stained the air with frequencies only bats and people who had chosen this life could hear. The audience began to arrive in clumps, their coats explaining their relationships to each other better than introductions would have. A mother looked at her daughter\u2019s eyeliner with humor and resignation; a boyfriend tried to pretend he didn\u2019t care where the toilets were; a teenager held a homemade sign that wavered between RAYNA ROCKS and ANTHONY FTW in the way of democracy. Backstage, people went quiet in the way people go quiet when the rooms they haunt are about to fill with strangers. A make-up brush turned one person into another kind of person. A costumer made a safety pin into a promise. A stage manager made a call sheet into scripture.\n\nThe suspenders, when she slid them over her shoulders, felt like muscle memory and a dare. The jacket went on over them with the weight of someone else\u2019s blessing. She stood in front of a mirror that had been meant for men taller than she was and let it see her. When she smiled at it, the smile didn\u2019t ask permission. She checked the coin in its pocket. It lay there like a secret that had been told to the right person at the right time and had forgiven the telling. She breathed once, very slowly, and then fast twice because breath liked a little variety.\n\n\u201cYou need anything?\u201d Maya asked from the door, which is the kind of question that makes people ask for impossible things and then forgive you for not being God.\n\n\u201cA small boat,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cFailing that, your opinion. If I flash red they will say I staged it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stage everything,\u201d Maya replied, unoffended. \u201cThat\u2019s what a stage is for. Show what you need. There is no jury that matters more than the one under your ribs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the river,\u201d Rayna said, only half a joke. Maya\u2019s mouth tilted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not brave enough to argue with water,\u201d she said, and touched two fingers to the doorframe like a widow practicing a religion only she liked.\n\nCall time is a lie. Call time is when you are already called. They pulled her into position with good hands. Jo\u2019s voice, quick and flat as a right answer, warmed her ear. The cranes mothered into their arcs. The host said words that meant numbers. The judges smiled with their teeth on; the crowd was a thousand small weathers adding up to a storm. Lianne touched the back of Rayna\u2019s elbow and squeezed once, a simple voltage exchange that said beside and go wreck them in a language without grammar.\n\nThe first chord landed right where it should have, like keys in a catch that had been oiled after a winter of sticking. The sound climbed into the ribs of the building and found old singing there and curled up close. Rayna let the verse be stingy because she knew the chorus would give like a grandmother with hands full of candy. In the second line, where she always wanted to speed because speed is a kind of courage until it isn\u2019t, she forced her breath to widen and the vowel to sit back on its heels. The camera loved her jaw angle without the tightness in it that had made the crane operator scold. She did not look for a watch. She looked into the dark the way you look into a friend who lets you have your own face. The bridge arrived, the flash point. She dragged a knuckle under the hem of the jacket with a motion that could have been fidgeting and was not, and let red blink like a gasp. The room inhaled. That was the point. She took the last corners at speed and made the words land soft anyway. She put the final consonant on the shelf like a bowl she would use later. She didn\u2019t drop it. She didn\u2019t throw it. She placed it down so gently people could hear the mercy in it.\n\nOn the other side of the noise, the judges did their choreography. Praise dressed up as criticism so their fans could pretend to disagree. Questions about America\u2019s habit of arriving late and loud, answered with a joke about British menus not warning her about peas. Compliment disguised as curiosity that let her say a line about builders and bar owners and Baruch atah Adonai because her first chord had been learned under a neon that buzzed like prayer. It was television. It was also real. Both things are allowed. When they sent her away from the X, she could feel her blood under her skin like a river that had decided to be generous for an hour.\n\nBack in the corridor that smelled faintly of hairspray and trumpet, Kamal said, \u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d in a tone that meant dozens of moving parts had done what they had promised and he was, for a second, letting himself consider trust. Pete made a face that approximated relief without giving away his habit of worrying as a sport. Tom mouthed nailed at her from the end of a hall and then looked embarrassed because men from his neighborhood only mouthed things at sports teams and the word luck. Lianne leaned her shoulder into Rayna\u2019s shoulder and let it rest there long enough for a little electricity to go home.\n\nThe rest of the acts took their turns. The aerialist spun grief into geometry. The magician improved the lemon, or the lemon improved the magician. A singer with a throat made of velvet and trauma stood and shook the room until it remembered how to cry politely. A child played drums like someone who had found a safe way to be angry. The audience did what audiences do and fell in and out of love with perfect freedom. Somewhere in the middle of it, the liaison slid by with a tilt of his head that said boring in the way a surgeon says successful. Somewhere toward the end, Maya touched the earpiece that connected her to a dozen voices and closed her eyes for a heartbeat in a way that looked like a prayer and was merely arithmetic.\n\nResults come as if they are weather purchased in bulk. They take forever and then they happen, and you do not get to be the person who controls the lever even if you have written the song. They lined up on the tape crosses that had their names under them on laminate. The host anesthetized them with words. The cameras practiced tenderness. The crowd tried to cause an earthquake by clapping in time. Rayna\u2019s coin sat warm in her pocket like a friend who had never learned tact and therefore made the best sort of ally. She breathed on counts even her fingers didn\u2019t need. She reminded herself that winning and next were different words on purpose. She also wanted it\u2014wanted the yes, wanted the bright green checkmark, wanted proof she could screenshot and send to a mother with soups. Want is not shameful if it doesn\u2019t make you cruel.\n\nThe show drew the last syllables out of the night and held them until the lights ached. The river outside went about its slow nasty business of pretending it had nothing to do with them. Rose sat somewhere in row F with peppermints in a bag and sensible shoes on her feet, aged like the good kind of wood. Nikki\u2019s cat kneaded a grocery bag until it fell in love. Andrew Bowman sat in a small room with cinderblock walls and told a story to a man with a tape recorder that will never sound as compelling on replay as it did in his head. Maya counted breaths backwards from a hundred and did not lose her place. Lianne rolled her ankles and thought about the years she had stolen back from pain by refusing to become it. Shiloh punched a couch pillow and then apologized to the couch pillow because it was not the villain. Rayna stood upright and let the cameras have the side of her face that forgave easily.\n\n\u201cAnd the winner,\u201d the host said in a tone that belonged to game shows and ringmasters and men who make a living asking other people to breathe wrong, \u201cof Britain\u2019s Got Talent\u2026\u201d\n\nThe room leaned. The noise leaned. The lights focused until they were an idea. Rayna\u2019s heart did not race so much as decide, firmly, to be present. Her jaw relaxed because the crane operator had taught her to love her vowels. The coin warmed like a sun at the bottom of a pocket. Her hand did not tighten. She did not look for a watch. She looked at the space just above the camera\u2019s glass where a little red light told the room when it was their turn to exist and lifted her chin half an inch as if to sniff the future. The name came. It was a sound that belonged to a person and a family and a set of hands and a city. It was not hers. It was also, somehow, not an insult.\n\nThe crowd did what crowds do when a thing has been decided by committee and desire. The sound rose and hardened and then softened again around the edges because kindness is fashionable at finales. The winner burst like a person who hadn\u2019t rehearsed it because you never can. The confetti cannons, which had been waiting since morning with a tension that creeps into machines with long, boring lives punctuated by fury, obeyed their cues. Gold fell on everyone in the way money never truly does. Rayna smiled the exact smile she ought to have smiled and meant it by sixty percent and grew the other forty because she believed in tipping the jar.\n\nBackstage was different because winners make gravity bend. She moved through with a measure that made people think of water poured into a glass rather than whitewater. Maya met her in the first quiet and didn\u2019t reach for the script at the corner of her mouth; she let it be. \u201cYou were a stone,\u201d she said, and it was not a clich\u00e9 but a diagnosis. \u201cA good one. The kind that knows it\u2019s heavy enough to be a place to sit. He will be furious,\u201d she added half an inch under the surface, the He unspecific and specific enough, \u201cbut only with himself, and he will have to find other rivers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not be boring,\u201d Rayna said, and it finally sounded like a vow to her own bones, not a retort to someone else\u2019s dare. \u201cHe can write his poems to a wall. I have work.\u201d\n\nWork looked like a phone that would not stop, like a string of messages from cities that were not this city, like a label assistant with a face like a Malamute asking about meetings, like Shiloh text-exploding with words like momentum and headline and cover, like Nikki typing ALL CAPS until her vowels broke. Work looked like a cab at three in the morning and a plane tomorrow and a mother who would pretend not to cry and then cry. Work looked like a river that lived on the opposite side of an ocean and benches with gum under them she could recognize blind.\n\nBefore she left the building, she went back onstage once with no one in the seats and stood at her mark and put her palm flat on the floor. It was cool and smelled faintly of feet and electricity and oranges from a rider someone had actually used. She whispered, because she wasn\u2019t superstitious and she had learned to indulge who she was anyway, \u201cThank you,\u201d to whoever collected thanks in rooms like this. She did not have to mean it with her whole heart for it to count. She meant it with enough.\n\nOutside, the river had given up trying to be mysterious and gone black and honest. The bridge wore its necklace of lights like a widow back from her first party. The doorman wished her luck as if luck were a garment he could hand her off a hook. Kamal, whose patience had worn into a groove finally, let his mouth settle into a true line of contentment that had no room for triumph. Pete said that he would spend the next week missing the sound of this building\u2019s elevators and then catch himself and be relieved. Tom offered half a biscuit he had saved for just this moment and then laughed at himself because it had gone stale and the sentiment had not.\n\nAt the hotel door, the night clerk lifted his hand in a salute that could have been, if you wanted it to be, the kind of thing men do in old films when ships pull away. In the lift, her mirror self looked tired and looked like someone who didn\u2019t mind. In the room, the river took up its usual position just beyond the glass like a neighbor who always fishes on the same evening. On the desk, there was nothing square. There was a cosseted bowl of fruit and the Welcome! card that had been too cheerful and had outlived its cheer. There was her guitar case, the small scuff on the edge where she had clipped it on a turnstile at home. There was the shoe she had glued, mouth sealed, sermon postponed. It would open again, because that\u2019s what shoes do if you wear them the way she wore her life. She would fix it when it did. Some things need glue. Some things need stitches. Some things need new leather and someone kind to pick out the old thread without sawing the holes bigger.\n\nShe washed her face without wincing at what cameras do to pores because she knew cameras did worse to people who think pores are the story. She took the suspenders off and laid them flat like a flag she had earned the right to fly only when she wanted. She took the coin out of the watch pocket and set it beside Rose\u2019s note. She thought about calling her mother and then didn\u2019t because it was late for better and early for worse and the time in between is when people tell stories they don\u2019t mean yet. She texted instead: Ate. Won enough. Home soon. Love you. Her mother\u2019s answer came back fast and was mostly exclamation points around the word proud, and that was more dangerous than any watch. She held her phone to her chest like a peppermint.\n\nShe slept. She dreamed. The river in the dream was not the Thames and not the one in Venice and not the one she had crossed with her family in a car that backfired like a joke. It was a different river, made of sound and hands and the parts of cities that don\u2019t get photographed. It had a mouth full of silver picks and a wrist where time lives chipped at two. It tried to pull at her laces and she looked at it and said, without anger, \u201cI know you,\u201d and then, like a woman who had learned where to place her feet, she turned away and walked toward a door that opened exactly when she reached it because it was hers.Chapter Eight\n\nMorning arrived like a clerk with a clipboard: prepared, brisk, punctual about its demands. Rayna woke before her alarm because nerves have their own calendars, lay still long enough to make sure her body parts agreed with one another, then slid out of bed and into a world that smelled like hotel detergent and last night\u2019s adrenaline cooling into something almost respectable. The river outside had put on its best pewter to make breakfast TV crews feel they\u2019d been given a proper English view. Her phone had turned into a fruit fly trap overnight\u2014unwanted calls and tiny urgent texts bzzing in because everyone she knew had stumbled into the same thought at 3 a.m. and decided that now was a perfectly reasonable time to share it.\n\nMaya had sent a schedule so neat it could have cut paper. BBC breakfast first. Then radio. Then a merciful forty-five-minute hole labeled Breathing. After that, press line in a lobby that tried to smell like money. She added, in an afterthought text that was not an afterthought, eat the beans, don\u2019t argue on air about beans, the nation has an agreement. Rayna laughed into her coffee because even the warning sounded like a small dare. She had never mistrusted a bean but she had misread a culture, once or twice. She pulled the midnight suit on because it had become not just an outfit but a story now, slipped the red suspenders under it with a satisfaction that felt like flossing, tucked the coin into its pocket, and fastened the top button like she was flipping the switch on a machine she\u2019d built herself.\n\nThe BBC couch had the cheerful cruelty of television furniture\u2014bright colors and unforgiving angles that dared you to slouch. The hosts ran on caffeine and choreography, teeth white enough to offend a camera and hair that had never known humidity like a friend. They shook her hand with practiced warmth and told her she was a delight before she\u2019d opened her mouth, which is both a compliment and an accusation if you look at it too closely. The bean bowl glistened in the corner as if it were a sponsor. The man on the left asked if she\u2019d slept. The woman on the right asked if she had a ritual. Rayna gave them both pieces of truth that didn\u2019t cost too much. She hums, she said, not because humming is magic but because it makes her remember she has a throat that isn\u2019t just a hose for other people\u2019s expectations. She sleeps sometimes in the middle of the day, hard and stupid, because night expects too much of her.\n\n\u201cAnd the trousers?\u201d the man said with a grin designed by a team. \u201cYou\u2019ve caused quite a stir online, Ray-na,\u201d he mispronounced it with good cheer, \u201cwith this\u2026 how would you put it\u2026 stud look? That\u2019s what they\u2019re calling it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would put it as getting dressed and leaving my house,\u201d Rayna said, very mildly. \u201cStud is for horses and idiots. I\u2019m a person. Clothes are how I keep myself from being arrested.\u201d\n\nThe woman laughed in the particular way job-secure people laugh\u2014audible, approving, safe. \u201cWe love a girl in a suit,\u201d she said, and then, sensing the shift, amended, \u201cWe love when anyone wears what feels like truth.\u201d They navigated the bean question with the grace of diplomats. Rayna ate one, politely, decided she didn\u2019t have to love it, and told Britain it tasted like Sunday. The man tried to coax her into naming names, winners and losers and who she liked best back there in the thunderdome. She slid away from him without making it look like sliding. \u201cThe thing about talent shows,\u201d she said, \u201cis you get to see how somebody looks at a room when all their practice is finally coming out of their pockets. That\u2019s my favorite part. Who looks up and smiles where they could cry.\u201d\n\nAfterward, in a corridor that had tried to be neutral and failed because beige is a position too, Maya handed her a paper cup and touched the back of her hand with two fingers. It wasn\u2019t a touch that asked for anything; it was the kind that says, hey, I saw. \u201cYou ate the bean,\u201d she said, impressed. \u201cYou did not make enemies out of legumes. We live to book another day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bean and I have an understanding,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cI won\u2019t slander it if it stays out of my guitar.\u201d\n\nRadio tasted like coffee gone cold and wires that had been warmed by other mouths. They sat her across from a man whose smile came through his voice like honey. He had grown up without hearing anyone like her on air, he confessed, and now he kept a list of every person who wrote their own story and brought it to his table. They talked about bus stops and bar owners, about the small holiness of passing a pick to a stranger and hearing them hand back your song in a new shape. He asked, gently, if the \u201csituation\u201d backstage had changed how she felt about being seen. \u201cIt reminded me that ownership is a bad verb for the public to learn,\u201d Rayna said, and the way the engineer in the booth nodded made her feel she had chosen a target worth hitting. \u201cI\u2019m glad someone got bored before anybody got hurt. Boredom is underrated as a weapon.\u201d\n\nWhen the hole labeled Breathing finally arrived, they fled the building to a market that smelled like wet cardboard and miracles. London does markets the way some families do gossip, with vigor and affection and plates involved. Rayna bought a roll that flaked shamefully onto her jacket and a paper cup full of strawberries that had learned to be sweet in a climate that wasn\u2019t trying to help them. She leaned on a railing and watched a busker fight his instrument into tune and lose, then win. He sang a song that had been famous in the nineties, the kind that takes three chords and a lot of forgiveness and makes you feel seventeen no matter how old you are. She couldn\u2019t help it. She threw a coin into his case and the coin was heavier than most. He looked up and his face did the thing faces do when they suddenly recognize a person they have only ever known as a rumor. \u201cNo way,\u201d he said in a whisper that carried. \u201cNo f\u2014\u201d He caught himself mid-swear because there was a toddler nearby chewing on a baguette like a woodworker.\n\n\u201cWay,\u201d Rayna said, not moving. He offered her his guitar. It is rude to say no when a city hands you a little stage. She glanced at Maya who has learned to say yes to the right wrong decisions. Maya lifted both hands in a gesture that meant don\u2019t look at me, I\u2019m not your mother, and also do it, coward. So Rayna took the busker\u2019s battered friend, flexed her fingers to learn its language quickly, tuned with that little flick of her wrist that made old men nod to themselves, and played the first line of the hook that had chased her across an ocean so hard that strangers in Los Angeles kept humming it back at the waves. The market\u2019s sound changed. People do this; when they think they might miss a thing, their bodies try to squeeze back into childhood and they crowd like children at a parade.\n\nShe didn\u2019t play it all because she wasn\u2019t a thief\u2014even of herself. She gave it eight bars of truth and then took a left turn into something older, a song the busker knew how to sing with her, and he did, and he did not embarrass himself, which he will be proud of for the rest of his life and it will be a story he tells to people in kitchens who will pretend to be bored and then go very still. When she handed the guitar back, someone put a tin into the case. It was cheap, bright with the promise of sugar. Rayna reached without thinking because reflex is a kind of love. Peppermints clacked inside. She didn\u2019t have to look up to know who had placed it there, but she did anyway. Rose stood three people back, hands folded over her bag like a triumphant spy.\n\n\u201cYou collect them,\u201d Rose said afterward, when they had been pushed into the eddy beside a flower stall that smelled like apology. \u201cI thought I would add to your hoard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will have to start a black market,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cI will sell them at a markup to BBC hosts and people who have seen God by accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou found being here was a blessing after all,\u201d Rose said, and she didn\u2019t make the word sound foolish. \u201cGood. That worries me when people fly over rivers to find work. Blessings can be fickle on arrival.\u201d\n\nRayna looked at her, at the coat the color of eggs meant for spring, at the eyes that had the reckless habit of offering unsolicited truth and making it feel like an heirloom. \u201cTell me about your man in the white suit,\u201d she said softly, because you do not always get a second chance to ask a ghost for a biography.\n\nRose\u2019s smile made a new wrinkle at one corner of her mouth, a good one. \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cMy personal river. He didn\u2019t steal my wallet. He did write me a poem about it later when he realized I had been the one to lift his\u2014men always assume they are the fox in any story. I danced on a ship before I danced on a stage you\u2019d know, because I was seventeen and stubborn and I thought the ocean would make a better companion than a husband who liked the horses. There\u2019s a way men in white suits look at the door on a ship\u2014you see it and you know to stand in front of it if you plan on making it your own. That\u2019s advice and a metaphor, duck. Keep both.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get free?\u201d Rayna asked, because she liked a narrative with an exit.\n\n\u201cI stopped performing for him,\u201d Rose said, shrugging like the motion had taken her twenty years to learn. \u201cPeople like that are audience junkies. When you turn your back they look for another theater. He found one. He bored me so terribly I could have wept with gratitude.\u201d She touched Rayna\u2019s sleeve, brought the fabric between thumb and forefinger as if assessing quality. \u201cYou sing like a person who won\u2019t let boredom become a river. Hold on to that.\u201d\n\nThe press line later felt like a tame stampede. People said her name in the rhythm of strobe lights. She practiced her parry-and-thrust until her arms felt like silk. A tabloid tried to sell her a headline with words like scandal and stalker and she responded with words like system and safety and \u201cSecurity is a profession, not a vibe,\u201d which was not a pull quote but turned out to be the only sentence out of that scrum people wanted to tattoo on their forearms. After, she leaned against a wall that had framed photos of the city from the seventies, everything brown and shaggy and honest, and texted her mother because the gap between time zones had turned into a mouth she could throw her voice into and expect an answer from.\n\nHer mother answered like she\u2019d been sitting on the phone waiting for permission to be proud again. The soup list came out first\u2014carrot, lentil, the fancy one with chickpeas that Rayna had once said tasted like a sweater. Then her mother\u2019s voice did the thing it does when it\u2019s going to say the brave thing without a drumroll. \u201cI was not silly because I could not be,\u201d she said, stepping into the unspoken thing as if she had decided to stop pretending the hallway was a wall. \u201cI was not silly because the pills made me flat and the world made me flatter and then I was embarrassed about being flat because everyone told me I used to be fun. That\u2019s the formula, isn\u2019t it? Woman plus exhaustion plus mother plus man gone equals\u2026 whatever it equals. I am better. I am still tired in the bones because I worked them when they were soft and I didn\u2019t know yet that that makes a different kind of tired. I am saying: forgive me for being less shiny for a while. I am shining again. In my kitchen. It is enough.\u201d\n\nRayna pressed the phone to her ear hard enough that comfort ran in like heat. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me shimmering,\u201d she said. \u201cYou owed yourself rest. I kept thinking if I sang loud enough it would bounce back at you. That\u2019s not how sound works.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, sometimes,\u201d her mother said softly. \u201cSometimes you have to sing at a person until their inside glass vibrates and remembers it is glass.\u201d She coughed, the old smoker\u2019s there-and-gone cough that startled both of them. \u201cBritish men? Are you being careful?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not collecting any of them,\u201d Rayna promised. \u201cThere is one woman with hair like a small storm who doesn\u2019t give me any choice but to listen when she speaks. I cherish her out loud. That will have to do for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d her mother said with a satisfaction that sounded like soup simmering a whole house. \u201cWrite your song. Don\u2019t be boring.\u201d She laughed so hard at herself that the connection fuzzed.\n\nBy late afternoon, the theater had shed its gala skin and put on the one it used for recovery. Cables lay around like snakes between naps. The crane operator sat on a stool eating a sandwich, her biceps relaxed and forgiving. There was a quiet you only get in rooms that have been loud, a hangover hush. Rayna, restless in the way she always was after an event, wandered the corridors, found the fuse cupboard because people had been muttering about it for two days like it was a goblin\u2019s lair, and stood in front of it with Kamal like a pair of burglars who had come to apologize. The door was shut. New locks shone, fresh and overconfident. Someone had taped another sign above the latch, the same hand that had written Left, Love. This one said We See You, which made her spine feel like it had been stretched and brought back to its proper length.\n\n\u201cWant to put a ribbon on it?\u201d Kamal murmured, almost smiling. \u201cMight as well make it a gift to yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Rayna said, and slipped her pick between her fingers, flipping it idly. \u201cI prefer not to feed cupboards. They get ideas.\u201d\n\nShe found Lianne in a rehearsal studio, one of those rooms with mirrors all along one wall like a personality disorder. The dancer had earbuds in and her body in a war with a metronome she had clearly decided to win without casualties. Rayna watched without speaking because you do not interrupt when someone is communing with their instrument, even if their instrument is every tendon they own. Lianne saw her in the glass, not startled, only interested, and beckoned her with a tilt of her head.\n\n\u201cYou look like a person who needs to invent a ritual,\u201d Lianne said, dropping to the floor and stretching her hamstrings until the gods themselves probably begged, gently, for mercy. \u201cBefore you go. Or you will end up packing for four hours and throwing a shoe across a room and weeping because you have to decide whether to take two shirts or three.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many is correct?\u201d Rayna asked, sitting, joining her, because she would try anything once if it made her hands feel less like conduits for electricity.\n\n\u201cTwo. Always two.\u201d Lianne grinned. \u201cOne for who you are. One for who you are telling yourself you will be when you land.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou vomit before shows,\u201d Rayna observed, affection slipping into her voice as if old. \u201cWhat do you do before flights?\u201d\n\n\u201cI look at the safety card and cry a little,\u201d Lianne said cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s cathartic. Then I sleep like a saint.\u201d She bent forward like a hinge. \u201cWill you write about us, in the way that means me? Will there be a line where you pretend I am anonymous and then reveal that I am the only person with ankles in London?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have to invent an ankle for you to be singular,\u201d Rayna said, mock-severe. \u201cLondon is mostly ankles.\u201d\n\nThey did not flirt. Not really. It would have been easy to, and then harder. They sat and breathed together until Rayna could feel her heart settling into the pace of a person, not a performer. Lianne showed her a sequence that pretended to be yoga until you tried it and then it confessed to being survival. Rayna attempted it and made a noise that made them both laugh and made her think of her brothers and how they used to crack each other\u2019s backs in the dark because they could. When she left, she took with her a series of movements she would pretend to have invented back in Los Angeles and give credit for loudly if anyone attempted to praise her for them.\n\nIn her room that night, with the suitcase yawning, the glue kit open like a reliquary, and the suit draped across a chair the way a handsome stranger might drape themselves across your plans, Rayna sat on the carpet and wrote. The song came out sideways at first, the way all new animals do, blinking and damp. She did not write the words he had used at her; she sanded them into her own. Don\u2019t be boring became don\u2019t be borrowed, and then don\u2019t be bartered, and suddenly it made sense why her jaw had hurt that whole first week\u2014she had been clenching against bargains she didn\u2019t intend to make. Loosen became a bridge, not an instruction she resented but a gift she could give herself, a room she could build out of breath. She put the river in, but not as villain; she put it in as witness. She put Rose in the second verse, disguised with a different color coat and a different ship and the same kind of good sense that makes a person stop performing for men in white suits. She put Nikki in as an aside because you cannot write a truth about yourself without the woman who mailed you glue and a weapon shaped like a joke. She put her mother in with soups, the spoon clinking against a pot like time keeping time.\n\nShe wrote until the words didn\u2019t improve with more of them. She stopped before she ruined it. She did the brave thing and did not show it to anyone immediately. She pressed her palm to the page and then left it, a blessing or a handprint fossils might read after the apocalypse and understand that someone had tried to make a sound, and had.\n\nShe slept badly and delightedly at the same time. Her body kept waking up to show her her own life, like a child tugging her sleeve because the moon was out. She got up once to stand by the window and watch the river do its neutral duty. \u201cI know you,\u201d she said again, but this time she didn\u2019t turn away. She let the water have her gaze, and maybe that was the turning. It did not tug at shoelaces through glass. It did not know her name. It kept flowing and she kept standing and the world did not break under the pressure of their mutual stubbornness.\n\nThe day she left was made of seams. Tom appeared at the door with a printed-out airline confirmation and a bag containing a sausage roll wrapped in a napkin with a note in felt-tip that said, For when airplane food tries to ruin your life. Pete had a gift, a small multi-tool in the shape of a credit card that made a joke of every TSA line that would confiscate it. \u201cKeep it in a drawer and think of me when something has a screw loose,\u201d he said, deadpan. Kamal shook her hand the way men do when they wish they touched more people and have trained themselves not to. \u201cIf you come back,\u201d he said, \u201cI will still be here. We like to pretend we are rivers but most of us are stones.\u201d\n\nJo caught her in the corridor and thrust a coil of cable into her hands, cackling when Rayna flinched. \u201cJoke,\u201d Jo said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you. It\u2019s a roll of gaffer tape. You will need it thrice in your life and one of those times will be to fix grace.\u201d\n\nMaya did not do speeches. She does not trust them; she believes in the small sentence delivered with faith instead. \u201cYou owe me one breakfast where nobody is watching,\u201d she said, serious as a check. \u201cYou owe me one song sung into a room that isn\u2019t being eaten by cameras. I owe you the assurance that I will not let anyone else write you while you are in my building. If you want back in the building, that is.\u201d Her eyes had the little light in them again, not a flirt, not not a flirt, something friendlier and more dangerous: respect with teeth. Rayna kissed her on the cheek, quick, sideways, a thing that could be a European affectation if either of them needed it to be. \u201cI\u2019m not done with your country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I owe my city some noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe your cat,\u201d Maya said, because she had read her briefings and was not above playing the Justice card.\n\nAt the barrier outside, Ems appeared out of air like a person who had learned to teleport because she wanted it enough. The beanie was a different color this time, green, brave. \u201cYou were everything,\u201d she yelled, then blushed because she hadn\u2019t planned to yell and Brits don\u2019t love yelling in daylight. \u201cMy mum bought leather,\u201d she added in a whisper that was actually a shriek. \u201cIt\u2019s red.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cShe can lend it to you later when she\u2019s ready.\u201d Ems made a face like someone who had planned on not having to deal with that idea for at least three years. Rayna signed her bus ticket instead of her arm. \u201cStay loud in the way that doesn\u2019t make you mean,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick.\u201d Ems nodded with the gravity of a person accepting instructions for a bomb that would go off if you held it wrong and then ran toward a woman waiting with a smile so bright Rayna had to look away.\n\nThe airport did its usual impressions\u2014long snakes of people pretending to be patient, announcements spoken by a voice designed by a committee, the smell of six different kitchens competing to be the one you regret most. The old man in corduroy was not there, but there was a woman with hair like cloud who crocheted without looking and a little boy who pressed both palms to the window when he saw a plane nose like it was the face of a whale. Rayna dropped into a seat near the gate and let her spine be a person lying on soft dirt. She texted Shiloh that she was not doing morning television in New York, not yet, he could scream if he wanted to, and he sent back a gif of a silent scream and then the words proud and feral in that order.\n\nOn the plane, aisle seat again because she liked being able to catch fate by the ankle if it tried to run past, she took the coin out and rubbed it with her thumb. The metal warmed the way coins do when you hold them long enough, familiar and more real for the touch. She slid it back and felt the little weight like punctuation. The woman in the window seat had no ring and a laptop full of slides with bars and pie slices. \u201cWork or holiday?\u201d she asked without wanting to talk, and when Rayna said Work, she nodded the nod of someone who had stacked two weeks of work into three days and knew it was a bad religion and kept practicing anyway. \u201cI envy you your job sometimes,\u201d she said, which is what people say because music looks like a beach if you stand far away from it and don\u2019t count the jellyfish. Rayna smiled and did not inventory the jellyfish. She closed her eyes and saw, not cameras, not faces, but the fuse cupboard with the new lock, Rose\u2019s peppermints, Lianne\u2019s bridge of ankle into ankle, Nikki\u2019s curved needle, Maya\u2019s don\u2019t-make-me-say-please look, Kamal\u2019s milk-quiet voice. She saw the river without dread. She let it be a line that cut the city into two halves that loved each other by arguing about boats. The pilot said words about weather that made people reach for their belts and then forget why they had reached. Wheels lifted. Her chest did the small gratitude trick it always did when the ground let her go without holding grudges.\n\nSomewhere over the Atlantic, as white fields of cloud below pretended they were something more noble than vapor, she opened her notebook. The words she\u2019d written last night were still good. They would need to be edited into something sharper and kinder and more cruel, all at once. She drew a little skull in the margin and gave it kind eyes so it wouldn\u2019t haunt the page like a warning. She wrote Left, Love in the corner, an arrow pointing toward a chord change that would need to be negotiated with patience. She drew a bean, because why not, and a peppermint, because some jokes die without attention. She thought about blue. Not the suit\u2014the color. The idea of it. How she had wanted to reject it because someone else had told her it was hers. How she could take it back now without letting it become a symbol someone else could hang their coat on. She wrote BLUE in block caps and then wrote beneath it, in her own quick hand: mine because I said so, not because you did.\n\nLos Angeles greeted her with the baked bread smell it put on when it wanted to be forgiven for being itself. The city pulled at her shirt like a child showing a drawing. Traffic ran like suspicion. The sky put on its guileless blue in apology for every time it had made her sweat. She breathed with her mouth open because she\u2019d missed the grit. At her building, paint flaking off the railing in a way that made her feel tender instead of mocked, she found a parcel on her doormat wrapped in brown paper and twine because someone was an aesthete in the age of tape. Her name was scrawled in a hand she knew better than her own sometimes. Inside, a jar of soup with a lid sealed tight as a promise, a note from her mother that said, Congratulations, with the word broken into three syllables like a shout, and a photograph that looked old and wasn\u2019t\u2014Nikki had printed the image from a FaceTime she had paused just right, the one where Rayna had tipped her head and smiled with half her mouth and the cat had glared at London from a cushion. On the back, Nikki had written, in her villain handwriting: Next time, bring me. Also, I warded your apartment with garlic and glitter. Don\u2019t be mad.\n\nHer apartment had the stillness of a room that had been missing someone. The guitar smelled more like itself than the hotel carpet had allowed. Justice stalked out of the bedroom with the slow disdain of a person who had been betrayed by a plane and then fed by a friend; he looked at her, did the blink that meant he suspected her of crimes and also worshipped her for the bacon she sometimes dropped. She dropped her suitcase, not gently, because the floor owed her, crossed the room, and lay down on the rug on her back like she had at the hotel and stared at the ceiling that had a little crack in it shaped like a tiny river you wouldn\u2019t notice unless you were the kind of person who noticed cracks.\n\nAcross the street, someone revved a car because they thought it made them important. Somewhere above her, a neighbor decided to vacuum at a time of day that made it an apology. Down the block, a man with a cart called out about oranges he had no intention of lowering his price on, because he had set it five cents below absurd and had no intention of changing his mind. Rayna closed her eyes. The room settled. Her body at last believed that the air she was breathing was the air it was meant to breathe.\n\nShe sat up after a minute because she was not a saint, and fame hates saints, and also because the jet lag had begun to sharpen inside her like a thousand small knives that could only be blunted by movement. She took her glued shoe, inspected it, nodded at her own handiwork because the split stayed sealed. She hung the midnight suit on its hanger and took a photo of it to send to Maya with the caption: I didn\u2019t spill beans on it, like you worried I would, liar. She placed Rose\u2019s note above the kitchen sink with a magnet that said, in the tone of a tattoo, Pay Your Band. She set the peppermint tin\u2014hers, the one with candy, not the one with picks\u2014on the table. She breathed into the room until it had the shape of her again.\n\nNight in Los Angeles is a different animal than London\u2019s. It is bigger and sloppier and less dignified and more forgiving. It doesn\u2019t know about rivers. It knows about traffic, about lawns, about smog that used to be worse. It knows about helicopters and Christmas lights in June and heat that refuses to shut up. Rayna went to the roof because she had missed it and because she had promised the morning on the roof that she would return with a story it could peacock about. The city had put on her grapefruit again: orange into pink, the bowl forever tipped. She strapped the guitar on and played the song she had written over there in the place where a river had challenged her and a man had been caught and a woman had handed over peppermints like relics. The words sat in the air between buildings like laundry. The hook did its job, the way hooks do, mean and sweet at once. She was not loud because there was no need to be. She was herself because there was no one else. In the building opposite, someone lifted a glass, and she lifted her pick in salute and did not hold it too tight. The echo came back a breath later, city to city, room to river, windows to air, the kind of echo that makes you think for a minute that everything is listening and nothing is bored.Chapter Ten\n\nThe first morning back tasted like a room that had remembered how to hold her. The kitchen window let in a slice of light shaped like a doormat, the kind that makes you feel welcome whether or not you let it trick you. Justice did his circuit of disdain, tail up like a small flag of a hostile nation, then relented and head-butted her shin with a grunt that sounded like a capitulation clause. The coffee maker hiccuped back to life as if it had muttered about abandonment all week and decided to forgive. Outside, someone hosed a sidewalk with the ceremony of a man baptizing his own mistakes, and a woman on the phone argued about cilantro in a tone that suggested war crimes had been committed in her salad.\n\nNikki arrived with the energy of a courier in a plague, mask askew, hair up, a canvas bag full of containers that sweated good intent. She brought soup because it was her covenant with Rayna\u2019s mother and glitter because it was her covenant with her own bad decisions, a zip bag that sparkled like an apology found on the floor of a club. \u201cDrink, eat, and then do not allow the music industry into our house for at least six hours,\u201d she decreed, hip-checking the door closed in a way that made Justice re-evaluate his borders. \u201cAlso, he tried to jump on the stove once, so I taught him \u2018no\u2019 in a tone that would shame a bishop. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\nRayna tasted the chickpea stew that had earned a reputation as the sweater soup and felt her shoulders relax as if oil had been warmed under her skin. Nikki poured coffee with a wrist that had learned grace in spite of itself and leaned against the counter like a woman auditioning for the part of Accomplice. \u201cYou wrote?\u201d she asked without ceremony, and Rayna nodded toward the notebook on the table, pages splayed open, ink dried in the pattern of a decision. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sing it before you let anyone talk about it, right,\u201d Nikki said, not really asking, and Rayna nodded again because there are vows you make with arm hair and not with language.\n\nShiloh tried to breach the six-hour embargo by texting from a meeting he had scheduled with people who had flown in from New York to offer adjectives. They loved her voice, they loved her jawline, they loved her \u201cnarrative elasticity,\u201d which sounded like a term invented by a man who believed in yoga only as a verb inflicted on women. He wanted to set a lunch. He wanted to broker a Zoom. He wanted bullet points and a plan that could survive contact with a Tuesday. Rayna stared at the screen, then typed, in a tone she had borrowed from Maya and kept because it fit, not today. Then she sent a photo of the soup with a caption that said, my agenda is legumes. Shiloh sent back a series of unsmiling face emojis that were meant to be a joke and narrowly avoided becoming a diagnosis.\n\nThe apartment had remembered her guitar the way a dog remembers a leash. She lifted it from its stand and the room\u2019s air changed as if a small animal had padded in. The coin in the watch pocket of her jeans warmed under thumb, becoming again a small sun she could carry around. She played the new thing quiet at first, letting the shape of it contradict the furniture until the furniture agreed to be part of it. The chorus still leapt like a girl who had said dare me at a playground, and the second verse needed to stop apologizing for being smart, but the bridge lay down and turned its throat to her without fear. Nikki watched without pretending she wasn\u2019t and then, when the last note set itself down like a cup on a coaster, she nodded into her own grin. \u201cNot borrowed,\u201d she said, as if she had named a cat and found the cat liked it. \u201cNot bartered. Not boring. It\u2019s you, and you\u2019ve got the teeth out.\u201d\n\nThey did a small domestic liturgy, the kind you invent when you come home from having been someone else for a week. Laundry, but not all of it, because denial is a right. Trash, but only the obvious kind, not the sentimental containers that smell like soup. They found the glitter Nikki had warded the apartment with in corners and refused to curse it because it wrote an argument on the floor that said, you are not safe from joy. Rayna called her mother and left a voice message full of laughter and weather and soup reports because her mother was at work and liked to play proud in public on a delay. She set the peppermint tin by the door like a saint and told herself that was superstition and not architecture.\n\nBy afternoon, the city had returned to its mode of soft interrogation. A friend texted about a backyard barbecue where nobody barbecued because half the guests were vegans and the other half had seen a documentary. A small venue in Echo Park asked if she wanted to \u201ccrash\u201d an open mic that had forgotten it was not a party. The label Shiloh liked texted with a gif of fireworks that managed to look like warning and celebration at once. Nikki put on sunglasses that made her look like a smuggler of tiny diamonds and said, \u201cNew rule: nothing with microphones unless you choose it because your chest asks for it.\u201d Rayna chose the backyard and brought her guitar without promising anybody anything, which is how she preferred to arrive anywhere that had folding chairs.\n\nThere are certain backyards in Los Angeles that have learned how to be churches. This one had string lights that forgave the hour, a table full of dishes coded for every allergy, a dog old enough to have an opinion about music, and a child whose job, apparently, was to pick up fallen limes and put them in a bowl with the concentration of a surgeon. People drifted toward Rayna the way iron filings drift toward a magnet and then, sensing the danger of naming it, drifted away again. She took a beer she didn\u2019t want because the hand offering it had fought with the bottle opener for her, sat on a low wall, and watched the sky bruise itself for the pleasure of a sunset nobody would photograph well.\n\nShe played when she felt like it and not when they asked, slipping into the place where performance is indistinguishable from breathing. The song wasn\u2019t the new one because she didn\u2019t want to give it away under fairy lights that had not signed a nondisclosure agreement with her heart. She sang one from the album that had got her invited to the first bar that didn\u2019t make her stack chairs at the end, and a woman whose name she did not catch cried politely into her own collar. The old dog laid its head on Rayna\u2019s sneaker in a vote of confidence. A man with a wrist tattoo of a teacup asked if she took requests and then shook his head at himself because the request he almost made belonged to a different decade and a girl he had wronged. Rayna was kind to him in silence. When she shifted to leave, somebody slid a square of paper into her guitar case and her stomach said no to it with heat. It wasn\u2019t block caps. It was a scrawl, human, a name and a number and a sentence: my sister wants to learn your song on clarinet, can she. She laughed at herself and the river of adrenaline that still ran under everything, and she texted the next morning with a chart and a note about breath.\n\nThe studio Shiloh booked for the session he swore he wasn\u2019t booking lived in Silver Lake in a building that had once been a bakery and before that had been a place where men cut pieces of other men\u2019s cars into shapes that could be called art. It smelled faintly of yeast if you breathed in a certain corner and of wood if you sat where the drums kept their secrets. The engineer was a woman with a braid thick enough to count as a safety device and a cat that ignored everyone until it didn\u2019t and then owned you. She listened to Rayna\u2019s demo, one hand on the fader like a therapist\u2019s hand on a tissue box, and nodded slow. \u201cIt\u2019s in the mouth,\u201d she said, making space for a fight and not offering one. \u201cDon\u2019t sing it from your shoulders. Sing it from the part of you that lies to border guards.\u201d\n\nThey built it without ceremony, which is how you trick a song into showing you where it wants to sit. Click, then no click. A guitar that felt like sunshine even though the light in the room was the color of tea. Brushes on the snare, then not, then a stick that had been worn down by someone else\u2019s stage. Rayna sang the scratch with her eyes closed because the engineer stopped her before she did the jaw thing. She didn\u2019t think about the watch. She didn\u2019t think about the mint tin. She thought about the breath in the word borrowed and how it sits for a second before it goes where it needs to. The second take had a sweetness that embarrassed her. The third had teeth. They kept the fourth for the line that had the joke in it that wasn\u2019t a joke.\n\nOn the break, they ate tacos from the truck that parked out front with the confidence of a man who knew his salsa was the only argument that mattered. Shiloh arrived with bad coffee and a face full of news he was trying to present as options so she would not feel caged. \u201cThey want it,\u201d he said, laying his hands out flat like a blackjack dealer who was also a priest. \u201cThey want everything; this one worst of all. They want to bundle you. They want to brand you. They want to give you a partner in a duet you\u2019ll loathe by June. We can take their money and run an empire, or we can take less and build something that lets you sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cSleep is not a moral,\u201d Rayna said, chewing thoughtfully. \u201cBut I like waking up. No duet unless my bones ask for it. No bundle. No nickname that would look good on a can of energy drink. I\u2019ll take help but not a leash. If they don\u2019t like that sentence in their mouth, they can spit it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngel,\u201d Shiloh said, pained and proud. \u201cYou make it look like it\u2019s easy to be principled when you\u2019re not hungry anymore. Remind me to feed you before punitive meetings. Also, one of the streaming platforms wants to do a live set in a warehouse designed to look like a different warehouse. Interested?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if I can make them use real chairs,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of white cubes pretending to be a place to sit.\u201d\n\nThe only time she thought of Andrew Bowman that week was when her mother sent a link to a local news story about a different city, a different man, a different pronoun turned into a plural to sound less lonely. The headline tried to be lurid and came out weary. Rayna didn\u2019t click. She texted back, soup recipe? Her mother sent three, each more confident than the last, each annotated with exasperated notes about grocery clerks who pretended not to know the difference between cumin and whatever it was the store had stocked in its place. The recipes were written in an unpunctuated cascade that made them look like a song if you tilted your head. Rayna printed them out and stuck them to the refrigerator with magnets that said please and thank you in languages she had never learned properly.\n\nBreakfast got claimed by Maya ten days later because competence and planes travel in packs. She was in town to consult on a pilot everyone said wouldn\u2019t get picked up and therefore would. She texted Rayna from a diner that had been set dressed by the ghost of Hopper and asked if the beans here were a safer nation. Rayna walked in at the exact right moment to see her flag down a waitress with two fingers and a glance that could have quashed a rebellion or sweetened a cake. They hugged as if the time zones had been a rumor. Maya smelled like rosemary and printer ink again, and Rayna realized she had missed that combination in a way you cannot admit out loud without inviting trouble.\n\n\u201cYou owe me this,\u201d Maya said, tapping her fork against a plate where eggs had been presented as if the chicken had held a grudge. \u201cYou owe me the moment after, when no one is looking, and you get to say the unpretty thought without someone from wardrobe correcting your posture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI owe you a favor I will pay in any currency you choose except beans,\u201d Rayna said, deflecting out of habit and because the morning had made her soft. \u201cI have unpretty thoughts by the dozen. Here\u2019s one: every time I put on a suit, I win a bar fight I didn\u2019t start, and it makes me want to wear pajamas because I do not want to make my day into a contest.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my unpretty thought,\u201d Maya said, chewing like a sentence she intended to finish. \u201cI\u2019m tired of my work getting called manipulation when the men who do it get called visionaries. I am as manipulative as a seamstress. I sew. The suit looks good because somebody stitched the seams so the cloth wouldn\u2019t lie. You wear the suit like a verb. Keep wearing it. Also, sometimes pajamas win. That\u2019s why they frighten executives more than sequins.\u201d\n\nThey did not talk about missed chances or choices disguised as invitations. They talked about budgets and about British press that had decided to be kind as a health fad. Maya asked after Lianne in a tone that would have sounded casual to anyone who hadn\u2019t seen her rewrite a camera plot with her eyes closed. Rayna showed her the beat-up routine Lianne had taught her, then the calf stretch that made her curse prettily. In return, Maya taught her a thing with a napkin and a sugar packet, a trick for calming a guest who didn\u2019t know their own name on the air\u2014slide the sugar back and forth until the sound becomes a metronome, let your fingers steal rhythm from the tiny thunder. \u201cYou can do it on a pick,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody will see, and you\u2019ll remember to loosen.\u201d\n\nAfter breakfast, Maya walked her past a mural that had gotten its letters right and a Jacaranda that had made a purple mess on a car whose owner would forgive it. At the curb she patted Rayna\u2019s arm lightly, the way one does to check whether a dream has a body. \u201cYou did well,\u201d she said. \u201cNot because you didn\u2019t win. Because you didn\u2019t appetize yourself for the wolves. Come back when you want. I will save you a seat where you can see the river without falling in.\u201d\n\nRayna went home and wrote until the sun tricked her into thinking it was later than it was. The song\u2019s bones had settled; it needed muscle, a bit of fat, a line that would make strangers pull their mouths to the side because they\u2019d found themselves in it and would not confess it. She put the word seamstress in as a nod to Maya, and then took it out because she liked the secret of a last edit. She left in the bit about soups and the bit where borrowed and bartered fought in her throat and the bit where \u201cLeft, love\u201d turned into a direction and an instruction at once. She left in the bridge that said loosen without instructing anyone else how.\n\nOn a Tuesday that felt like a Friday because the sky had decided to be hungover, she played a secret show in a laundromat on Sunset where the owner liked to say artists paid in quarters and then refuse their money when he realized they had walked across the room in their socks. The floor had a sheen of detergent that made the air smell like the childhoods of people who had been loved enough to have clean socks always. People perched on plastic chairs in sober blues and robust oranges, posted without telling their friends because the spell works better if not everyone believes in it yet. Rayna moved her guitar case aside so a woman could get to machine nine. A man with a baby strapped to his chest did the bounce that said, soporific, please. The spin cycles hummed along to the verse and hissed at the vowels, a choir of domesticity.\n\nShe had the suspenders under a shirt she had inherited from someone who told her to keep it til it broke and meant the shirt and not the friendship. She didn\u2019t flash them because the rooms she had come from had taught her that quiet dares are the ones that last. She sang \u201cLoosen,\u201d which wasn\u2019t called that anywhere you could sue, and the room leaned toward her like a plant made of people. The baby slept. The owner clapped so loudly it scared the machines and everyone laughed and then were embarrassed at having laughed at a washer. Afterward, a woman with hair like a halo of bees came up, put both hands on the counter to steady herself against the sentiment coming, and said, \u201cMy husband thinks he knows me because he knows our mortgage. Your song made me want to own something he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Rayna didn\u2019t prescribe divorce or debt. She said, \u201cStart with a secret muscle,\u201d and the woman nodded like someone who had been given a tool she could hide in her purse.\n\nIt would have been tidy for the next week to behave as if arcs were trams and tracks were obligations. Instead it sprawled, lush and stupid, into meetings and sleep and a small fever that was either lack of rest or the city\u2019s pollen trying to kiss her. Shiloh got her fifty percent of everything she swore she hadn\u2019t wanted because he had learned to ask for what she needed after learning he could not make her want what everyone else did. The warehouse show became a small theater with bad seats and great sound because she insisted. The engineer sent the mix and Rayna made herself do the hum test\u2014if a thing still moved her with her own mouth closed, it had earned its place. The hum sat correctly in her chest like furniture she hadn\u2019t realized she had built to suit herself.\n\nRose wrote a letter in ink that had seen worse pens. It arrived with two peppermints taped to it the way light sticks to the tops of waves in patient weather. She had included a photograph of herself on a ship deck with two girls whose thighs looked immortal, all three in dresses that had been engineered for updrafts and learning. On the back she wrote in the understated voice of a person who knows the power of understatements: It is better to be bored than frightened. I prefer to be entertained than either. You were both. Tell your cat I forgive him for being a cat. Rayna laughed, then cried, then held the photo against a glass of sunlight until their dresses shone like a promise no one could hold her to.\n\nAndrew Bowman pled to a list of things that read like an etiquette class for criminals. Trespass. Tampering. Impersonating staff. It did not make a good headline and so it did not get one, and she savored that petty mercy like dessert. There would be others. There are always others. She did not reorganize her life around the ghost of his watch. She did not forgive him to make herself look noble. She did not dedicate songs to the memory of his nerve. She let the cupboard with the new lock live in her head as a place where other people did their jobs and she did hers, which was, it turned out, sometimes the most radical thing people could manage together.\n\nNikki kissed her on the mouth one night like a dare and then pulled back like a person checking a door for heat. It was not a surprise, and it was not inevitable. It felt like a hand over a bruise that had healed into a new color she hadn\u2019t learned the name for. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to name it today,\u201d Nikki said, and sat down on the rug cross-legged and handed Rayna a pick. \u201cWe can pretend we\u2019re in a band and the band rules are a constitution and the constitution says no cruelty, no martyrdom, and honesty that doesn\u2019t get the other person arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want a clause about soup,\u201d Rayna said, and they wrote it in, and then they played a song so bad it made them cackle like teenagers and allowed the night to decide for them when the next kiss would be.\n\nWhen she finally took the song to a room with lights and money, she wore the midnight suit and the suspenders and the coin and the shirt with the history and a pair of shoes she had stitched herself with Nikki\u2019s needle because you do not get to keep the metaphor if you refuse the labor. The room had a low ceiling and a reputation for rumors that came true. The crowd brought a weather system with them, charged and affectionate. She walked to her mark with the same breath she had carried across the bridge in London when the gull had asked about chips as if they were a political party. She looked into the dark the way you look into a lover you trust not to find a better party between now and the middle of the second verse. The first chord landed like a sentence finished and forgiven.\n\nShe did not tighten her hand on the pick. She loosened everything else instead\u2014the jaw, the knee, the small muscle behind her right shoulder that had been taught to brace by men who think volume is authority. She allowed herself the ridiculous luxury of liking herself for the length of a chorus. She believed she would be boring if she tried to be safe. She believed she could be safe without being boring. She believed, briefly and entirely, that the river in London and the dry channel that pretends to be a river here had called a truce over her head, and that she was permitted, for a song, to be the person on the bank who knew them and walked away at the right time.\n\nAfter, outside among the smokers and the lovers and the drinkers who thought hydration was a fad, a young man with a skateboard under his arm told her he had never thought about loosen as anything but failure. He wore a shirt from a gas station he had not been to. His hair had a practical part. He spoke careful, like a man who had remembered to be a boy in a pinch. \u201cMy dad held everything like it was going to run,\u201d he said. \u201cI hold everything like that. My wife tells me I choke. Your song felt like a small insult to that habit. Thank you for insulting me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cTry insult as a hobby. It grows on a person.\u201d\n\nBack on the roof later, the city wore its grapefruit the way a woman wears a dress that someone told her not to, with glee and intent. The air moved though nothing in particular told it to, fresh enough to lie. The neighbor who vacuums at unholy hours folded laundry in a window and did not know anyone was watching. The siren in the distance changed its mind about urgency. Justice hunted a silver moth with a seriousness that should be reserved for international disputes. Rayna leaned her guitar against the low wall and watched the small scurf of glitter in the mayhem of the rug catch light and throw it right back. Somewhere under her skin, the river ran, the good kind, the one made of breath and tendon and the laws of physics when you sing correctly. She put her hand over the watch pocket like a woman pledging an allegiance to a nation unlikely to shoot her. The night did what it does when it believes you will keep your word and keep showing up. It made room. It didn\u2019t get bored. And for once, neither did she.",

On the roof of the converted warehouse she rented down in the Arts District, Rayna Cruz wound the strap of her guitar around her shoulder and let the city climb into her lungs. She was not the kind of singer who needed a crowd to be loud. She had that lick of thunder in her anyway. If she didn\u2019t let it out, it left claw marks under her skin.\n\nShe adjusted the brim of her cap, yanked low over the shaved lines at the side of her head, the tattoo of a shuttlecock and a star peeking by her ear. The cap said STAY LOOSE in a font that looked like it had been cut with a razor in the 90s. Her brothers said she stole swagger from the radio. Her exes said she carried it like an old debt. Strangers called her a stud on TikTok, capital S, like a title. Rayna shrugged at that word. She knew herself. It wasn\u2019t a costume. It was the way she walked into rooms. It was the fact she could fix a sink trap, back a truck into a narrow lot, and carry a chorus in the same hour. It was the way she could stand still for someone else and then not.\n\nThe warehouse roof was warm even before eight. Down in the street, trash trucks hissed, men in neon vests yelled in kindness, pigeons watched like accountants. Rayna played a chord, then another, the sound bouncing off brick and sky, the city\u2019s echo a good kind of ring. Her fingers were a little raw from last night\u2019s run, but she liked the sting. It meant belief. It meant work had happened. She liked sweat.\n\nHer phone buzzed on top of the amp. She let it buzz. Another chord. A riff she\u2019d been wading into and out of for two weeks. It had a hook you could hang a coat on, a tail that wagged the rest of the song. She had eyes closed and teeth showing when the buzz stopped. Then started again in a panic-stutter. She sighed, rolled her shoulders, and glanced at the screen.\n\nUnknown number. +44 ahead of all the digits. Her heart did a stupid, swallow quick thing.\n\nShe answered with a lazy, \u201cYo,\u201d because if you start too eager, they hear you for what you want and sometimes that smell attracts sharks.\n\n\u201cIs this Miss Cruz?\u201d The voice was crisp and warm around the crispness, like a shortbread cookie dipped in tea. British, but not the fancy version of British everyone pretended to be when they called from overseas.\n\n\u201cThis is Rayna. Who wants her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Maya Patel, executive producer with\u2014\u201d a pause like she knew how names landed, \u201c\u2014with the team at Britain\u2019s Got Talent. Are you in a place where you can talk freely?\u201d\n\nRayna pulled the strap over her head and balanced the guitar on her thigh. The roof. The city. Her heart now a snare drum. \u201cSure. What\u2019s up?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a difficult woman to get a hold of. Emails to your agent were bouncing, and our Los Angeles contact gave us three numbers, only one of which was an automated recording promising taco discounts at a place that does not, tragically, exist.\u201d\n\n\u201cI move fast.\u201d Her grin made its own weather. \u201cYou might have better luck on pigeons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll note that. We watched your bus stop show in Venice. Twice in our office, once at home. The internet has feelings about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the internet. It\u2019s a lot of feelings.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica has you. We would like you, too,\u201d Maya said lightly. Then less light: \u201cWe\u2019re calling to offer you a wildcard slot in our final. You\u2019re eligible as a global invite. We do this sometimes. It upsets the purists. It lifts ratings. Our viewers will be ready to love you or boo you. Your audition tape\u2014with the crowd singing back your hook and your ex appealing to the security guard\u2014was\u2026 it was messy. But you weren\u2019t. It was very clear you know how to hold a storm at the center of your ribs. Do you want this?\u201d\n\nRayna stood. The city receded and came back, receded and came back. Down below, someone was shouting, \u201cHey! Hey! That\u2019s my parking space!\u201d and then laughter that sounded like parts rattling in an engine hood.\n\n\u201cDo I want\u2014\u201d Her voice broke very slightly, and she allowed it. \u201cI\u2019m good enough for your final? You\u2019re serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t waste international minutes on a prank. It\u2019s short notice,\u201d Maya continued, fast because she had a train to catch, Rayna could hear it, \u201cYou\u2019d fly this week, rehearsals next, camera blocking, a ridiculous number of \u2018backstories\u2019 meetings that you will hate but will survive, and then the night itself. You can bring your own band. Our team can arrange one. We have one request.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo pyro indoors without regulation. We say this to everyone, because every season, someone tries to set themselves on fire. Fight the urge.\u201d\n\nRayna sat down and then stood up again. \u201cI\u2019ll deal with it. I won\u2019t combust on purpose. Probably.\u201d Maya laughed on the other end, a small, true laugh. \u201cYes,\u201d Rayna said, surprising herself with how small the word was. \u201cYes, I\u2019m in. I already am. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThere was a pause where both of them grinned into the phone at no one. \u201cWonderful. I\u2019ll email you the preliminary schedule. We\u2019ll need vaccination records and visas and a list of your tech needs. We\u2019ll arrange hotel. And Rayna, because I like to say it: practice hard, but don\u2019t grind yourself into dust. We have cleaners for the confetti, not your bones.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up, Rayna pressed her fingertips to her eyes and laughed. She let it ring out over the roofs. A man on the next building over looked up from his jump rope and threw his hands in the air like a preacher. She threw hers back. She yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d to the morning, to pigeons, to America, to the British who might wave and boo in equal measure.\n\nHer day rewired itself. She slid down the fire escape deliberately wreckless, skipped a rung and then two. She took the stairs to her place three at a time. She woke the coffee machine like it owed her money. Her cat, Justice, blinked once, then twice, then flicked his tail at the idea of Britain like it was a metaphor for birds.\n\nNikki called as Rayna was leaning against the sink, watching the kettle, thinking about how she\u2019d tell her mother. Nikki didn\u2019t say hello. \u201cDid you die?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you dying?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, of delight.\u201d\n\nNikki squealed high and long, bounced across an octave, then said, \u201cYou don\u2019t squeal, so I have to do it for you,\u201d in that exact voice that had cracked the window when they were twenty-two and had a tiny apartment above a bar in Echo Park where no one ever slept.\n\n\u201cBGT,\u201d Rayna said, and the words tasted like something fizzy that had popped on her tongue. \u201cFinal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know!\u201d Nikki shrieked again. \u201cMaya already DM\u2019d me for your paperwork because, quote, you\u2019re a plane with a radio that\u2019s been shot off by kids throwing rocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey always go around me to find a grown-up. Are you free? Come scream at me in my face.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m halfway to you. I brought you the good tortas because this is a celebration, and I know you won\u2019t remember to eat once you start packing or, I don\u2019t know, shining your shoes.\u201d\n\nRayna looked down at her shoes. One scuffed, one scuffed and coming apart at the toe. \u201cThey have character.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have a character who has given up.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want my shoes to reflect my inner life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen your inner life needs glue,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cOpen the door.\u201d\n\nLater, after tortas smeared with avocado and carnitas and after Nikki had danced in the kitchen with Justice in her arms like he was a beige bagpipe, after the small soft confession\u2014\u201cI\u2019m a little scared, Nik, will I be a joke?\u201d\u2014was countered with old-school ferocity\u2014\u201cYou\u2019re the only person I know who looks better standing in front of a thousand people than you do alone\u201d\u2014Rayna sat at her table and made a list with a stub of a pencil and a receipt: passports, guitar strings, suits that were not a funeral, adapters, throat spray, lucky coin.\n\nThere was a knock while Nikki was telling a story about the time she mistook a famous actor for a plumber and asked him about grout. Rayna opened the door to a delivery man with a square, a little breathless from stairs.\n\n\u201cPackage for Ree-na? Or Rye-na? I always say it wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cRayna,\u201d she said. \u201cYou just have to commit. Like you\u2019re jumping a fence.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, Rayna.\u201d He smiled. \u201cSign?\u201d\n\nThe box was black and white and striped, no return address visible. Inside, under tissue paper that smelled faintly of lilacs and pepper, was a pair of red suspenders and a note written in blocky capitals.\n\nWEAR THESE IN LONDON IF YOU WANT TO WIN. FROM A FRIEND WHO SEES YOU.\n\nNikki went quiet in the way she gets quiet when she\u2019s thinking too hard. \u201cThat\u2019s some Hannibal Lecter energy.\u201d\n\nRayna turned the suspenders in her hands. They were the color of first strawberries, of a phone booth, of caution made into desire. \u201cOr maybe it\u2019s an old Butch Fairy Godmother.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only fairies I trust are the ones with receipts.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re looking at one.\u201d Rayna slipped her arms into the straps and let the suspenders hang over her shoulders like a dare. She grinned at Nikki, a little crooked. \u201cHow\u2019s it look?\u201d\n\n\u201cGay,\u201d Nikki said affectionately. \u201cLike a patio in June.\u201d\n\nShe packed. She called her mother, who cried in the way she\u2019d cried when Rayna got her GED because some of the crying was joy and some of it was the shock of relief. \u201cYou won\u2019t be cold, will you?\u201d her mother asked. \u201cYou\u2019re not good with sleeves.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take a jacket,\u201d Rayna lied. Then amended: \u201cI\u2019ll take two shirts that together make the idea of a jacket.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat,\u201d her mother said.\n\n\u201cAlways.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd be careful with British men.\u201d\n\n\u201cMom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey look like they\u2019d steal your wallet and then write you a poem about it.\u201d\n\nRayna laughed and let the laugh be long. She loved her mother when her mother got silly, which had started, mercifully, again after the long stretch when her mother hadn\u2019t been silly at all because of the thing they didn\u2019t talk about and should have. Rayna hung up and thought about that unspoken thing for a minute and then put it away like a shirt she was saving for a better party.\n\nLAX was a wrestler that day, grip sweaty, shoulders broad. Rayna moved through it like she owned the place because the trick wasn\u2019t to convince others; it was to convince your feet. The plane was packed. Kids with headphones too big for their ears, a couple in matching tracksuits reading a guide to London that had a Union Jack on the cover like that helped with anything, an old man in a corduroy jacket who smelled like good cigars and old notebooks. Rayna had the aisle seat. The woman in the window seat wore a faded sweater with small embroidered birds and the kind of wedding ring that said she\u2019d kept it on through fifty years of dish washing, gardening, weather.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re off to London?\u201d the woman asked, and then, catching herself, \u201cWell, obviously you are. It would be an odd flight to board if you weren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRayna smiled. \u201cI am.\u201d\n\n\u201cBusiness or pleasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth. If I do it right.\u201d\n\nThe woman nodded with approval that felt like a blessing. She fished a hard candy out of her bag and held it out. \u201cPeppermint. I hoard them. Planes make me think of a church, and I always think of peppermints in church.\u201d\n\nRayna took the candy. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cRose.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice to meet you, Rose.\u201d They shared their candy like two children sharing crayons. After takeoff, Rose leaned toward the window and talked about the time she\u2019d been a chorus girl on a ship that sailed to New York and the way the sea used to feel like a rumor and the way she\u2019d danced past a man in a white suit and felt the first real danger of her life. \u201cI\u2019m rambling,\u201d Rose said, \u201cbut I\u2019m at an age where I\u2019m entitled to use words until others beg me to stop. May I say a rude thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo ahead.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe careful near the river,\u201d Rose said in a tone that had no jest in it at all.\n\nRayna laughed. \u201cYou mean the Thames? Why? Because it\u2019s wet?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it takes whatever you haven\u2019t decided about yourself and tries to hold on to it. Rivers do that.\u201d She pressed her hand to the window. Her palm left a little fog on the glass like a ghost had paused there to see if the world was still real. \u201cEspecially that one. There\u2019s a reason Londoners talk about it like it\u2019s a person.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cFor the warning.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t sleep on the plane though she tried. She typed notes into her phone until her thumbs hurt. She listened to the same song four times because it had the kind of gallop she needed. Words lined up, then broke ranks and ran. She wrote down fragments:\n\n\u2014 the sound of the crowd = not wind, not waves, maybe bees\n\u2014 don\u2019t smile until the second chorus, make them want it\n\u2014 call brother, tell him not to bet on me unless he wants to do dishes\n\u2014 the river\n\nThey landed to a smut-gray sky that had the decency to brighten as the plane taxied. Heathrow yawned, and Rayna yawned back. The customs line was a sorry snake. She put her palms in her pockets and rocked on her heels. She tried to look honest. She was honest. She tried to look like a person who would declare her almonds if she had any.\n\nA man with a cardboard sign that said RAYNA C in marker met her after baggage claim. \u201cMaya sent me,\u201d he said, accent deep London, syllables like bricks. \u201cI\u2019m Tom, runner-slash-asst. I do whatever she tells me until I pass out.\u201d\n\n\u201cNice to meet you, Tom.\u201d She stuck her hand out. He took it with surprise and then decided he liked it.\n\nThey drove into the city through rain that couldn\u2019t make up its mind. The car moved like a cork in a river of vans and buses that looked like they were wearing red uniforms. Tom chattered about the best place to get falafel, the worst time to take the tube, the grocer who overcharged tourists for apples, the rumor that the pianist in one of the contestants had once been a bank robber. \u201cDon\u2019t quote me,\u201d Tom said, \u201cEnglish libel law is a dragon, and I am soft.\u201d\n\nThey pulled up in front of the hotel, glass and steel winking, on the South Bank where the river lay heavy and important like a dog who knows it will be fed. The hotel lobby was gray in a sexy way, men and women in suits that seemed to have been poured over them like sugar. Maya was waiting though she pretended she wasn\u2019t, looking at her phone and then looking right up exactly as Rayna walked through the rotating door.\n\n\u201cHi.\u201d Maya stood, smile bright but not fluorescent. She wore boots and a blazer, hair loose around her shoulders. Up close, she smelled like rosemary and printer ink. \u201cYou made it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did,\u201d Rayna said, and for a second, she wanted to hug Maya, which was ridiculous, because she didn\u2019t know her. They shook hands instead, firm like they were both checking if the other was an anchor.\n\n\u201cWe put you on the ninth floor,\u201d Maya said, waving toward the elevators, \u201cbecause the tenth has a bachelor party in it, and I believe in not forcing proximity with men in matching T-shirts. Do you need time to nap before we do stage? Our schedule today is a lighten-the-load sort, but television always lies about that.\u201d\n\nRayna shouldered her guitar. \u201cGive me ten minutes to not look like a person who just lived in the air for too long. Then I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\nIn the elevator, Maya watched Rayna\u2019s reflection and said, \u201cYou\u2019re not what I expected.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d\n\n\u201cMore\u2026 legend. More persona. You have the persona, but you also have teeth. That\u2019s, forgive me, rare in our visitors from the States.\u201d\n\n\u201cI currently have most of my teeth,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cBut I\u2019ll outsource the legend to the internet. They\u2019re good at that, when they\u2019re not busy falling apart.\u201d\n\nHer room had a view of the Thames. Boats slid like loafers. The London Eye turned slow like a thought you didn\u2019t want to have. Rayna leaned her forehead against the glass and thought: I will carve a space inside this place with my sound. Then she thought: That\u2019s a weird way to put it. Then she laughed at herself. Her brain was the kind that shook out the pocket lint in inappropriate rooms.\n\nThere was a card on her desk that said Welcome! in a too-cheery font, and a basket with fruit that looked like it had been groomed. There were flowers, lilies and something that may have been peonies. Tucked under the ribbon was a slip of paper like the one the suspenders had come with, blocky caps again:\n\nYOU LOOK BETTER IN BLUE. SEE YOU SOON.\n\nHer skin prickled. She held the note up like evidence and considered calling the front desk to ask for whoever had delivered it to be returned to sender\u2014No, she told herself. Maybe it\u2019s a fan with access. Maybe it\u2019s nothing. The suspenders had been funny. This was just theatrical. She shook it off and put the note in the drawer, where it sat like a little dark mouse.\n\nShe splashed water on her face, changed into a button-down that flattered her shoulders and her long, efficient neck, ran her hand over her hair, smiled at herself without the intention to seduce anyone but the person in the mirror. Nikki had told her once that the mirror loved her because she never lied to it.\n\nThe stage in the theater felt like an ocean floor, cables for coral. Techs moved like fish that knew how to solder. Everything hummed in a key Rayna could have bent with her fingertip if she tried. She did not try. She saved her strength for notes.\n\nTom introduced her to a stage manager named Liza with a Z and a tech wizard named Gary who spoke to lights like they were vulnerable children he was coaxing across a street. She shook hands with a keyboardist who had callouses older than most of her exes. She said hi to a magician who made a quarter disappear behind her ear and then asked, \u201cDo you mind if I borrow your watch for a trick later?\u201d She laughed. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nMaya brought her to a corner dressed like a cozy living room and said they needed a bit for the roll-in, a set piece where she\u2019d talk about where she came from and why she sang, and they\u2019d cut it so that it made everyone root for her. \u201cWe tell these stories responsibly,\u201d Maya said, eyes level. \u201cWe don\u2019t trap you in your own biography.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll spare you the part where I did my homework under the table in a bar while my mom worked nights. Or maybe I won\u2019t. Depends on how you ask.\u201d\n\nShe talked for fifteen minutes. She told the camera about the bus stop shows and the odd way strangers will hand you their grief like a bag they don\u2019t want to carry anymore if you give them a chord to put it in. She told a clean version of her first fistfight and a messy version of her first song. When the camera turned off, she felt out of breath. The floor under her steadied her feet.\n\nShe ran the song once, then twice, then a half time with just the lights moving like they were reconsidering the room. People stopped and watched. People pretended not to be doing exactly that, then did anyway. She heard a stagehand murmur, \u201cGod, the American,\u201d and someone else murmur back, \u201cCalm down,\u201d and the first voice say, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nWhen she came off, Maya gave her a nod, small but sincere. Tom handed her a bottle of water and a blueberry muffin that had too much crumb on top like a crown. \u201cYou need sugar. You were shaking. No one else could see, but I could.\u201d\n\n\u201cI shake because I care,\u201d Rayna said.\n\nOn the way back to her hotel, a man on the south side of the bridge bumped into her shoulder. Hard. Hard as if the city had pushed him. He wasn\u2019t large, but he was not entirely small. He had a rag of a bandage wrapped around his left hand, and there was a kind of waxiness to his skin that you saw sometimes on people who spent too much time in swimming pools or on pills. He muttered something that might have been sorry and might have been its opposite. His eye darted once, twice, like a fish in a too-shallow bowl. Rayna stepped back, and the river took a breath. Then the man was gone, absorbed into the afternoon. It left an odd taste along her gumline. She realized she\u2019d bitten the inside of her lip.\n\nShe had a call scheduled with a tabloid, which she would have skipped but Maya had used the kind of tone that vibrated the bones when she said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t say no to the Mirror,\u201d and she was trying to be good. She went back to her room. The river was the color of someone\u2019s old tea. She propped her phone on the windowsill and let the reporter ask his questions. \u201cWill you sing,\u201d he drawled, \u201cor will you seduce?\u201d\n\n\u201cI can multitask,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m here to sing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re something of a\u2026 what\u2019s the phrase, a stud?\u201d he said, as if he were tipping the word off the edge of his tongue with his index finger. \u201cOur writers are already in love with you. The women, the men, possibly the pigeons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like pigeons,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cThey know survival.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Los Angeles? Will you miss it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways. Los Angeles is like family\u2014I can complain about it, and I do, but don\u2019t you dare.\u201d\n\nAfter the call, she lay on the carpet and thought about words like stud that had been slung at her like both coins and curses. She let the weight of them sit on her belly for a minute. She liked who she was. She had built herself the way she liked kitchens: tough, easy to clean, with a window that let in light.\n\nThe note in the drawer bothered her like a flea. She opened the drawer, looked at it again. YOU LOOK BETTER IN BLUE. SEE YOU SOON. She considered going down to the desk to ask who had access to her room. She called instead. The receptionist was apologetic and efficient. \u201cIt was delivered by an external party with permission from production,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have the name as A. Bowman.\u201d\n\nRayna didn\u2019t know an A. Bowman. It sounded invented. The receptionist added, \u201cThey also asked us to pass on a\u2026 scarf? But we declined because we don\u2019t accept garments, it\u2019s a policy.\u201d\n\nGood policy, Rayna thought. \u201cThank you. It\u2019s probably nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt never is, is it?\u201d the receptionist said in a way that made the hair along Rayna\u2019s forearms fizz.\n\nThat night, sleep came like a cat: only when she had stopped inviting it. Dreams did their more-than-usual nonsense. She was running through Venice, the boardwalk bending like a rubber band, and the ocean kept trying to come down the street, but it was made of people in gray suits instead of water. Someone was laughing. She was laughing, too, the kind of laugh that sounds like crying at a distance. She woke with her throat sore and didn\u2019t know why.\n\nAt three in the morning, London\u2019s night had a different set of teeth than L.A.\u2019s. Sirens had a different accent. Even the silence tried on another coat. Rayna pulled on her coat\u2014she had brought one, in the end, a peacoat someone had given her at a party in Highland Park because she had said, half-drunk, \u201cI like your collar,\u201d and he had said, very drunk, \u201cTake it.\u201d She went downstairs and asked the man at the door if she could walk. He looked at the river like it was an accomplice and said, \u201cStay on the lit side, yeah? Don\u2019t go behind the buildings.\u201d\n\nShe nodded. The wind was not cold exactly; it was nosy. She crossed the bridge and stood in the middle, watching the water try to pretend it wasn\u2019t moving when very clearly it was. Rose\u2019s voice whispered: Be careful near the river, and Rayna said out loud, \u201cI am.\u201d A couple walked past with their jackets zipped all the way up to their chins, their laughter contained by fabric. A cyclist whizzed by like a knife. A gull landed on the stone half a foot from her sneaker and cocked its head as if to ask if she had any chips, and if not, why.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have chips,\u201d Rayna told the gull. \u201cI have a song.\u201d The gull didn\u2019t care. The gull strutted an inch closer and then, deciding she was a disappointment, took off with a flap that smacked air.\n\nBehind her, someone cheered, softly. She turned, heart quickening but not in the dangerous way. A young woman, maybe nineteen, maybe twenty-one, with a tuft of blue hair under her beanie, held her phone out. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to scream because Brits don\u2019t scream in public unless they\u2019re footballing. But you\u2019re Rayna, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the rumor,\u201d Rayna said.\n\n\u201cCan I\u2026?\u201d The young woman made the international symbol for selfie. Rayna said yes, smiled, then stopped smiling and did her smirk because that was the one that circulated best. The girl\u2019s hands shook. \u201cMy mum loves you,\u201d she said. \u201cShe says you remind her of the girl she used to be. That\u2019s a compliment,\u201d she added, visibly afraid it wasn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt is.\u201d Rayna took the phone and took another photo where she looked less like a wolf and more like a grandmother, on purpose. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cEms.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, Ems. Go home. It\u2019s late. Tell your mum I said she should wear leather again.\u201d\n\nEms made a face at the word leather that was mostly delight and a little horror. She skipped away, then stopped and yelled back, \u201cBreak them all, okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll try.\u201d A group of boys came the opposite direction, hooded. One of them looked at her and then looked again, and his face rearranged itself into something she didn\u2019t want to name, so she moved on. The river did its river thing. She went back to the hotel. Her phone had a missed call from an unknown number, London code. She let it be. The voicemail was a rustle and a scrape and maybe a laugh, maybe a cough. She deleted it.\n\nThe next day at rehearsal, the lights failed right when she hit the bridge of her song. Pitch black. Someone yelled, \u201cHold!\u201d A curtain rustled. For a moment, a heartbeat, she heard someone humming the melody she\u2019d written, but slower, like a lullaby for a child who hated sleeping. She did not get goosebumps. Her goosebumps got goosebumps. When the lights came back, she saw movement at the edge of the stage, a shadow where shadows shouldn\u2019t cluster. The shape of a person leaning, then gone. She stayed where she was because she wasn\u2019t about to give the dark the satisfaction of her panic. She sang the bridge again, louder. Lights sizzled and obeyed.\n\nBackstage, a bouquet waited again. Hydrangeas this time, and the card tucked deep, like the flowers had its secret in their throat. It\u2019s funny, the way your eyes adjust to fear. They learn to anticipate the shape of the card before they see the white rectangle. Maya spotted her holding it and came over. \u201cEverything all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone knows I got to London before I told even my aunt,\u201d Rayna said with a lightness that was daylight on ice. \u201cDo your fans do this? Leave\u2026 notes that feel like they\u2019re peeking through a keyhole?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is to ask: are you safe?\u201d Maya took the card from her hands like she had authority to. The message, the same block capitals, said: YOU BROKE A STRING SECOND SONG LAST WEEK. I WAS THERE. NICE SAVE. TRY TUNING DOWN WHEN NERVOUS. SEE YOU.\n\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Maya said. She looked around, called over a person whose badge declared Security in all caps. \u201cWe have protocols,\u201d she told Rayna in a low voice. \u201cWe\u2019ll check tapes. We\u2019ll limit your room access to a smaller list. You\u2019ll have an escort to and from the hotel. I\u2019d rather overreact than under. If it\u2019s nothing, we\u2019re embarrassed. If it\u2019s something\u2026\u201d She didn\u2019t finish.\n\n\u201cA person who knows something about me is out there,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cAnd I would prefer if that person stayed in \u2018out there.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThat we can do,\u201d Maya said.\n\nBy the time she went to bed, she had two new emails from tabloids with subject lines like: IS RAYNA CRUZ DATING? and WHO IS THIS AMERICAN? A kid from South London had sent a DM video of herself playing the hook on a recorder because she had broken her real instrument and the school would not replace it. A boy from Manchester had written: I didn\u2019t know you could be like that and still be normal and I don\u2019t know what that says about me (sorry) but my heart felt weird in a good way seeing you. She answered him carefully: You don\u2019t have to be a thing any way that hurts. That\u2019s the rule. Thank you for your note. Don\u2019t apologize for your heart being in the right place.\n\nThe city continued to have weather whether or not she made time for it. The British insisted on talking about rain exactly when it wasn\u2019t raining. Rayna got lost twice, badly, because London was less of a grid and more of a ball of rubber bands that rolled downhill and collected other bands as it went. A man on a bike shouted advice across lanes of traffic that could have killed him. She stood in front of a painting older than her entire family\u2019s documented existence and felt a bit dizzy. She ate a sausage roll that tasted like all the parts of a pig that had sworn to be delicious. She met a dancer in an elevator who had nerves that stood up under her skin like wires and who said, matter-of-fact, \u201cI vomit before every performance, and then I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\nIn a small cafe near Covent Garden with pretty tiles and a waitress who said duck like a hug, Rayna sat with Shiloh, her manager, who had flown in late because his mother had had a scare and then was fine and then had told him to stop hovering around her like a satellite.\n\n\u201cYou look good,\u201d Shiloh said, stirring his coffee and then not remembering to drink it, jittering without input. \u201cInternet\u2019s a mess. Good buzz. Some ugliness, but not more than usual. Don\u2019t look.\u201d\n\n\u201cI looked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re forbidden from looking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI looked and I am still alive.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes you die six hours later,\u201d Shiloh said, smile sharp as a bent staple. He leaned back. \u201cAll right, tell me everything. Don\u2019t spare me. I want the flavor.\u201d\n\nRayna told him. She did not tell him about the notes until he asked why she was looking over her shoulder in a place with a floral wallpaper. He put his cup down hard. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like this. I will get a person to stand outside your door who is large enough to be his own postal code.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaya\u2019s already on it,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cIt might be nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is never nothing,\u201d Shiloh said, echoing the receptionist without knowing it. \u201cI want you to take this seriously.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d Rayna wanted to argue and also wanted to be seen as capable. Both things fought. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Also, someone from press said they want to do a piece on \u2018the American stud,\u2019 and I said no because they don\u2019t get to do that. You are a musician, not a type.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am both. But thank you.\u201d She smiled. \u201cOkay. My set. They won\u2019t let me have a skate ramp on stage, which is fair. Insurance would erupt. But I want to open with a silhouette. I want the first sound to be breath, like I\u2019m inside your ear, and then the guitar hits like a door slammed on purpose. I want the lights to strobe on the words NO FEAR, but instead of the N, it flickers for a second, so it says either \u2018No fear\u2019 or \u2018Of ear.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOf ear?\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to make people feel unsteady and then catch them.\u201d\n\nShiloh nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re mean,\u201d he said eyes bright with pride.\n\nThey walked back to the theater together and split at the stage door. Maya was there, hair up now, looking like she was trying to find a way to squeeze twenty-nine hours into a day without changing the laws of physics. \u201cWe\u2019re pushing your rehearsal to six,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a problem with the harness for the aerialist, she got tangled like yarn, and I\u2019m trying to ask the crew to cut without the aerialist yelling at me in a way that will get us in trouble in the papers. Can you be flexible?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m rubber,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cI bounce.\u201d\n\nMaya put a hand on her shoulder. \u201cI like you,\u201d she said, quick and honest. \u201cSome people show up like they think we\u2019re keepsakes.\u201d\n\nThe building had too many corridors. If you turned right, you hit a wall that said No Entry. If you turned left, you ended up in a room full of lamps and a guy named Carl who did not know why he had a room of lamps but was quite pleased about it. Rayna turned left instead of right, then right instead of left. She found a hallway that had lunch plates left outside of doors and the smell of gravy hovering low. A door clicked behind her. She glanced back. Nothing there. She told herself she would take a different elevator next time because this one made a noise like an old woman\u2019s knee.\n\nIn the bathroom, she washed her hands for longer than necessary. When she looked up at the mirror, someone had written on the fog with a fingertip: HUM AND BREATHE, DON\u2019T CHOKE IT. She spun around, heart in her throat, but the stalls were all empty. She wasn\u2019t even sure if the message had been for her. It might be a generic piece of good advice. She rubbed the words away with her sleeve. When she left, the corridor felt narrower than it had going in.\n\nThat evening, she sat cross-legged on the floor of her room with the guitar in her lap. She didn\u2019t care if the hotel frowned at the noise. She played soft. She didn\u2019t need to scare the tourists back into their suits. She had the window open a crack, because she liked to let air in even if the air was damp. Someone across in the opposite building played a trumpet badly for exactly eight bars and then stopped, probably because someone else had banged on their wall. Rayna smiled into the space between chords and then frowned because she could feel it again\u2014the thrum under the thrum, the city\u2019s own metronome. She tapped her foot. She let it align.\n\nHer phone buzzed. Nikki. FaceTime. \u201cShow me London.\u201d\n\nRayna swung the phone toward the window. Nikki said, \u201cLooks like Cleveland but if it was run by a swan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s accurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike actually okay or showbiz okay?\u201d\n\nRayna weighed the answer. \u201cI\u2019m okay, okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cDrink water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m drinking.\u201d\n\n\u201cEat vegetables.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d Nikki said, and then softer, \u201cYou\u2019re doing something big and scary. I wish I were there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll see it,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cI\u2019ll be loud enough to cross a whole ocean.\u201d\n\nAfter they hung up, Rayna went back to her guitar. She played until her hand hurt in a way that felt right. She sang quiet. She sang louder. She sang until her shoulders went from stone to forgiving. The river ran. People did the late-night things people do\u2014kissed, carried takeout, argued with their future selves, jogged because they were running from whatever they thought running could outrun. She slept without dreaming this time, or she dreamed without remembering, which is almost the same thing.\n\nOn the morning of the reading with the judges, a drizzle freckled the window. Rayna put on a shirt that made her look like she\u2019d been born knowing how to tie knots. She tugged at the suspenders in her bag and, for a memory, almost put them on before thinking better of it and leaving them. The elevator dinged. Tom was there with a clipboard and the face of a man who had already seen more than one hysterical argument about a fog machine. \u201cOur girl,\u201d he said. \u201cReady?\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Rayna said, and meant it just then. She let the doors close. The river stood behind her in the glass, tall and patient. It had all the time in the world. She had a sliver, and she intended to shine a beam through it like a blade.\n\nIn the theater\u2019s bowels, something rattled. The magician scowled at his cards as if they had betrayed him. The aerialist was not in a harness and was therefore delighted. The dancer who vomited had a bottle of water and a red mouth as if she\u2019d eaten cherries; she had not.\n\nMaya found Rayna at the edge of the stage and said, \u201cOur health team would like to have the finalists do quick checks, nothing invasive, just keep the flu out of our building. Sorry to be a hall monitor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can breathe and hum. I can show them both.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfect.\u201d The health officer, a woman with small glasses and a bigger patience, handed Rayna a thermometer and a form to fill out that asked, in small calm boxes, if she\u2019d had close contact with anyone sick, if she had headaches, if she had been feeling unsafe. Rayna ticked boxes and gave her the kind of smile she saved for women who kept the world from becoming more stupid.\n\nIn the wings, at the curtain, just before the hall opened, someone passed by, too close, the zip of their hoodie catching on the button of her shirt. She felt the fabric tug and then release. The person didn\u2019t apologize. She turned to catch a face and saw only a shoulder, and on the shoulder, a patch in the shape of a skull that was smiling in the wrong way. It wasn\u2019t a note, but it felt like one. She shook it off. She didn\u2019t have time for someone else\u2019s theater.\n\nThe judges walked in, their glow manufactured and real toggle-switching in and out. The room swelled and then settled. Rayna took her place on the tape X. She barely noticed the camera. She barely noticed her own tongue. She noticed the chord under the floor, the city\u2019s hum, her own pulse hitching in sympathy.\n\nShe sang. And even the river held still to listen. For a breath. For a breath and a beat longer. And then it went on being a river, and she went on being a girl with a guitar who looked like a storm in a suit. And in the darkness beyond the lights, someone else moved, closer than they had any right to be, watching as if they had already decided that wanting something meant it belonged to them. She did not know any of that yet. But the world already did. The world had been making room for it, the way it makes room for rain.",

                              "content": "The judges\u2019 room was colder than the stage like it had a grudge about budgets. A long curve of table, little bottles of water sweating politely, placards with names that meant something to millions and almost nothing to Rayna except for the fact that these were the people who currently held the ladder. They gave her their faces the way TV people do, soft at the edges and sharp where money lived. A woman with a bob that could have been used to slice an apple asked a careful question about authenticity. A man in a sweater the color of an expensive bruise said the word phenomenon like he was frightened of it but flirting anyway. A third judge, the one audiences love the way you love a fire you have the option to walk away from, tilted his head in a way that had made careers and ulcerated stomachs. He smiled without warmth and asked whether she thought the British would welcome an American into their house at the last minute with something like gratitude or something closer to the noise a chair makes when it\u2019s dragged.\n\nRayna kept her hands loose on the neck of the guitar, as if she were holding an animal that trusted her for no reason. She kept her answer honest and showed her teeth only where they made a point. \u201cYou invited me,\u201d she said without starch. \u201cI brought my own plate because I know better than to ask you to pass.\u201d The room laughed or pretended it hadn\u2019t decided yet, which on television is more valuable than laughter because it gives the cameras something to study. They pressed her on backstory, the girl-in-bar-homework, the brothers, the tattoo, the ex at the bus stop who had appealed to security as if security could secure the past from mischief. She gave what she wanted to give and kept the rest like it was cash in her sock. When they dismissed her with smiles and a nod to the fact that she looked \u201ccompellingly British in that shirt,\u201d she let herself enjoy the skate of relief down her spine. It felt like a hand working out a knot that had been a friend so long she\u2019d named it.\n\nMaya was waiting in the corridor with a clutch of producers who all looked at once relieved and caffeinated to the point of prophecy. Up close, Maya\u2019s eyes had the light of a person who could tell you where the nearest fire extinguisher was while also teasing you about your terrible taste in sandwiches. \u201cThey\u2019re happy,\u201d she said, then lower, \u201cHe\u2019ll ask for something messier on air. He can smell boundaries. We\u2019ll keep him at heel.\u201d Tom, who\u2019d been vibrating nearby like a tuning fork that had found purpose, held out a Tupperware full of grapes he had clearly filched from craft services. \u201cGrapes for our champion,\u201d he announced. \u201cGreat for the throat. Terrible if you\u2019re trying to look mysterious while eating them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do mysterious,\u201d Rayna said, popping one, \u201cI do obvious in a way that requires interpretation.\u201d\n\nThey moved through the building like it was a maze designed by someone who\u2019d only ever seen corridors in a film. Every corner had another corner. Every door promised less than it suggested. Maya updated her on schedule, on the camera blocking they\u2019d do tomorrow with the crane shot she had argued for and won and was now pretending she\u2019d always had. \u201cWardrobe after lunch,\u201d she added. \u201cOur sponsor is a brand that thinks tailoring is a religion. They will want to try you in nine different suits to figure out which one permits America to exist without causing offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo any of them involve sleeves,\u201d Rayna said, \u201cor are sleeves considered a moral failure?\u201d\n\n\u201cEngland loves a sleeve,\u201d Maya said, pleased. \u201cWe will ease you into them like a cat into a bath.\u201d\n\nWardrobe was a warehouse of cloth with its own weather system. A woman with tape around her neck and a mouth pencil short enough to count as a weapon slid three jackets onto Rayna\u2019s shoulders in such quick succession the air itself got confused and tried to put on a blazer. The suits were good, in that way things are good when purpose has forethought and money. Blue, of course, appeared not once but four times, in four nearly identical shades that the wardrobe assistant called navy, night, ink, and almost black before catching herself and saying, sorry, midnight. Rayna felt that old prickling along the skin between shoulder and neck when the fourth blue went on and fit too well. It felt like a compliment and a trap. The assistant spun her toward a mirror and smiled at the result like a haircut. \u201cSee?\u201d she said. \u201cNow the internet can thirst without feeling they\u2019ve sinned.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would prefer the internet sin,\u201d Rayna replied, and then softened because the woman was only doing her job and doing it with hands that had pinned a hundred hopes into seams. \u201cMidnight is good. But not because some stranger left me a note about it.\u201d The assistant looked up at her in a quick startle and then away, and Rayna wished the sentence back into her mouth even as she knew you could never really swallow a thing like that up again.\n\nSecurity had, in the hours since the hydrangeas, bloomed into a presence you couldn\u2019t ignore. A man the color of boiled coffee shadowed her when she moved between rooms, and a woman with a smile like a seatbelt stood between the green room and the corridor that led to the stage. They all had earpieces and that slight, hummingbird restlessness that comes from being asked to anticipate danger and then being given a hallway full of lunch trays. One of them introduced himself as Kamal, which he said rhymed with \u201ccalm\u201d in a way that made it clear he\u2019d had the joke wrung out of him and still kept offering it because he believed in courtesy like other people believed in saints. \u201cYou\u2019ll see me,\u201d he told her. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t, I will see you,\u201d which somehow felt more reassuring than anything else had all day.\n\nBetween rehearsal and a camera test they did a sit-down in a too-bright room that had a succulent in the corner looking at them like they were the bad decisions that had brought them to sunlight. The show\u2019s story producer wanted the bar under the table to be raised or lowered depending on how much of the phrase father figure Rayna was willing to tolerate. \u201cCan we talk about your dad?\u201d the woman asked, with that seesaw tone therapists and television people share. \u201cCan we talk about what he was like and whether he was around, and how you coped?\u201d Rayna balanced her heel on the rung of the chair and stared for a second at the tabletop, which had a scratch near the top left corner in the exact shape of Wyoming. She considered saying yes. She considered saying no. She considered telling them about the way her mother had folded in on herself when the little factory hours had been cut and she had filled her pockets with tips that smelled like ketchup and tired men. Instead, she told the story where the bar owner had taught her to play E minor properly because he was sick of watching her pretend she had it. The story was not a lie, and parts of it had tears in their pockets if you knew where to put your fingers. The producer nodded and had the decency not to push. \u201cWe\u2019ll find your other edges another time,\u201d she said. \u201cI have faith in your layers.\u201d\n\nBy late afternoon the city had decided to be damp without the fuss of rain. The river hulked below the window of her room like a thought you keep having even though it makes you feel weird. She stood there with the blue suit draped across a chair back like a person waiting to speak and felt tired in a way that reminded her of school bus mornings, where the air tasted like pennies and the day seemed both promise and dare. She had five minutes before a call with Shiloh to go over some press he\u2019d triaged into good, bad, and weird, and she spent the first four fighting the urge to go downstairs and ask the desk to show her the entry logs. She stayed still. She breathed. She texted Nikki a photo of the suit and a caption that said, I give in to the sleeve lobby, and Nikki wrote back, You look like a storm that pays taxes. Then she sent a photo of Justice asleep on an upside-down grocery bag like a rug he had hunted to death. The laugh that came out of Rayna wasn\u2019t a big one, but it was whole, which is sometimes better.\n\nThe guitar was where she had left it, leaning against the chair like a friend with opinions. She tuned. Or she tried to. Something was off by more than flight and air conditioning. The G string had been loosened to the point of foolishness and the low E had been tuned two steps down with the kind of confidence born of familiarity. Her hands didn\u2019t shake when she found it, but the room felt briefly like it had lost a notch on a hinge, the door swinging too far. She could have done that herself half-asleep, sure. She could have bumped it. She could have imagined she had tightened when she had loosened. She could have been sloppy, since she believed in the resurrection of good hands after long nights. She could, but she hadn\u2019t. When she lifted the guitar, a clean human scent rose from the wood that was not hers. It was faint, a trace of peppermint or maybe eucalyptus. Halls of memory opened in her nose\u2014Rose\u2019s candy in the airplane seat, the way her palms had warmed the wrapper, the way she\u2019d pressed her hand to glass and warned Rayna about a river. She retuned the strings with method. A few turns. A few more. She checked the door even though she always locked it out of muscle rather than worry. The latch clicked like it loved being reliable.\n\nShe called Shiloh and told him the press could write whatever it liked as long as it spelled her name right, and he told her that was how you ended up with shirts silk-screened with Raina and a thousand people calling you a meteor because they can\u2019t bring themselves to say comet. He tried to get her to agree to a breakfast television slot where hosts with teeth like glaciers would offer her baked beans and she\u2019d ask on air whether beans counted as a breakfast food or a Sunday afternoon form of penance. She hedged because her vocal cords drew boundaries that her ambition sometimes tripped over. They argued in the old, comfortable way and ended with him calling her a menace and her calling him a bishop in Guilty Pleasures. Then he said, without humor, \u201cWhoever is sniffing around, I want a name,\u201d and she said she did, too, and when they hung up, she stared at the guitar like it might give it to her if asked nicely.\n\nThe next note didn\u2019t show up in flowers. It was taped to the inside of the elevator, knee-level, where no one with eyes on messages would look first. She didn\u2019t see it until she had started to step out on the stage floor with Kamal a few feet behind her and Tom a few ahead and Maya arranging people by tone and hair light. It was a cheap piece of hotel stationery, the kind you use for grocery lists and apologies you aren\u2019t ready to make. It read: YOU HOLD YOUR PICK TOO TIGHT WHEN YOU\u2019RE LYING. She kept her face polite and bored, because that is how you survive men who like to take credit for knowing you before you do. Kamal saw it the second her eyes did. He did not make the sound a guard makes when he is trying not to make a sound. He took three steps backward without taking his eyes off her and spoke into the air. The elevator doors thumped shut like a mouth that had decided against a story. By the time they reopened, the note was gone and a man in a high-vis vest was holding a roll of tape and explaining to another man about load-bearing capacity as if he\u2019d been there the whole time.\n\n\u201cPeople who do that kind of thing,\u201d Maya said later, in a small office where they pretended the air tasted like calm, \u201cwant to ruin your sense of your own edges. They want you to feel permeable. They want you to check locks that aren\u2019t broken. They want you to mistake vigilance for fatigue. We won\u2019t give them that.\u201d Rayna looked at her and wondered when exactly she had decided to trust this woman with her voice in ways she did not trust herself with her irritation. She nodded like a pact. She said, \u201cOkay,\u201d because sometimes the most useful word in the language is ordinary. The show gave her a minder who was, unlike Kamal, capable of being invisible on demand. She learned his name was Pete on the second day because he\u2019d been introduced as production and then had materialized whenever an elevator opened onto a corridor that wasn\u2019t hers. \u201cIf I do my job right,\u201d he said cheerily, \u201cyou\u2019ll never remember I existed,\u201d which is both a terrible thing to say to someone and the precise thing that made Rayna relax two degrees.\n\nBy the time the day of the camera run arrived, Rayna knew the building\u2019s smell. She knew which corners lived colder than others, which switch panels were sticky with the residue of ten seasons of hands, which stagehands flirted with lighting because they were cowed by sound. She knew where to put her feet when the truss squealed and where to stand so the smoke would catch in the frosted cones just enough to make her halo look like an accident. She wore the midnight suit. She refused a tie because she wanted throat. She let wardrobe tuck her shirt in with affection and impatience. She stood under the kill lights and waited, shoulders down, mouth soft, pick in place but loose, very loose, so loose it could fall without heartache. She didn\u2019t think about the note. She thought about the thing the audience didn\u2019t know they wanted until she gave it to them and the snap in the middle when they went from withholding to throwing themselves at her like she was a lake they\u2019d been dared to jump.\n\nThe camera operator with the crane was a woman with biceps that made Rayna want to do a push-up out of courtesy. \u201cWhen you move there,\u201d she said, tapping a bit of tape shaped like a carelessly applied bandaid, \u201cI catch you across, and we do this flirt, this lazy left, feels like summer. Then we drop. Go again. Again. Beautiful. Don\u2019t do that thing with your jaw. You tighten. It reads as arrogance, and you are arrogant, but not like that.\u201d The operator grinned when she said it. Rayna grinned back and let the note become another reminder to keep her face where she lived it\u2014in that space between invitation and dare.\n\nThe afternoon was a queue. Music, makeup, press who asked if she could pretend to hum something for b-roll and looked like they wanted to applaud when she refused gently because humming on command felt like asking her to be thirsty in public. A boy who made puppets out of cereal boxes lost his glue and cried in a corner and then stopped crying when a sixty-year-old floor manager crouched and handed him scissors with the gravity of a knighted hero. The aerialist did not vomit and looked disappointed in herself for breaking tradition. The magician flicked a coin and told Rayna she had eyes like a bar fight. She didn\u2019t ask him if he meant that kindly. She went outside for five minutes and let London wrap around her. The sky was the color of a bruise that had healed. The river smelled like a penny left in a mouth too long. A gull stole a chip from a boy who had dropped it as bait and seemed genuinely amazed when it worked.\n\nAt the barrier, a family with three kids asked for a photo, and the smallest one, a girl with missing teeth and a sweater that had a dinosaur wearing a scarf, touched the red suspenders peeking out of Rayna\u2019s bag like they were a talisman and then pulled her hand back as if she\u2019d overstepped. \u201cThey\u2019re loud,\u201d the girl said gravely. \u201cMy mum says sometimes loud things are good.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mum is right,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cSometimes loud things tell the truth you can\u2019t get out in a whisper.\u201d\n\nBack inside the building, a runner handed her a garment bag with her name on it in careful block letters. She hadn\u2019t asked for anything, and the sight of her name written by a stranger\u2019s hand made something ancient in her chest go stiff. \u201cWho dropped this?\u201d she asked, and the runner, who was new enough to still look like a deer that had negotiated a ceasefire with traffic, said, \u201cFront desk,\u201d like that explained the world. Rayna took the bag and went into a room where she could pull the zipper down without being a citizen in a public square. Inside was a suit, a twin to the midnight, but blue like a Pool of Bethesda if it had been tailored by someone who understood American shoulders. It was expensive in that shameless way that makes people feel they should look twice. There was no designer tag in the normal place. The label had been unpicked carefully, as if a person had removed evidence with love. In the breast pocket was a small envelope with her name again. The card inside was a miniature of the hotel stationery, like a cousin you\u2019d both forgive. SEE? it read. DON\u2019T PRETEND YOU DIDN\u2019T WANT THIS. WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER. She sat down on the bench without meaning to. The suit watched her. For a moment she imagined putting it on and walking on stage and letting the secret move like silk along her skin. For a moment she imagined what it would feel like to collude. Then she stood and carried the bag to Maya\u2019s office and put it on the desk like evidence.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m delighted by the budget,\u201d Maya said dryly because dry was the only option in some kitchens. She didn\u2019t touch the suit. She called in Security. She let her face go flat in a way Rayna hadn\u2019t seen before. \u201cWe escalate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will start treating this like a person with access rather than a fan with initiative. We will get the police liaison to stop pretending this is charming.\u201d She looked at Rayna and all the joking left the room. \u201cWe will not use this for ratings,\u201d she added for free, and something in Rayna\u2019s ribcage stood down like a sentry who\u2019d heard the password.\n\nThe rehearsal that evening had teeth. The band felt looser the way good shoes feel when you\u2019ve broken them in and they\u2019ve decided you\u2019re worth forgiving. The lights did the trick with the almost-N flicker so that the word fear kept trying to shed its front and become ear, and under it, in the pit of the room where seats slept waiting for bodies, the sound engineer nodded along as if someone had proven an algebra he\u2019d been arguing with since the nineties. Rayna did not think about the blue suit sitting in a clear plastic bag on a desk like an argument. She did not think about the river or the peppermint or the way the man with the bandage had bumped her shoulder as if she were a door that needed testing. She thought about the line she\u2019d written under that hook weeks ago, the one that unraveled on its own and then returned, shy. She thought about breath. She thought about holding no longer than necessary.\n\nBackstage, in the cheap light, she found the dancer with the red mouth and sat beside her on a trunk that had the grit of decades on it. \u201cYou do that thing,\u201d the dancer said without looking up from wrapping her ankle. \u201cWhen you finish, you don\u2019t throw the last note away, you put it down like a mug in a sink you intend to wash later. My mother does that. Not with notes. With glass.\u201d Rayna laughed because the image repaired something. The dancer glanced up and her eyes sharpened to interest, not hunger. \u201cI\u2019m Lianne,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m going to throw up in about three minutes, and then I\u2019m going to rip a hole in that floor.\u201d She squared her shoulders like someone braced on a ship. \u201cYou can stand behind me if you want when the weather comes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather stand beside,\u201d Rayna said, and Lianne\u2019s mouth curved like a woman who had just decided on a pair of shoes without asking anyone\u2019s permission. They didn\u2019t exchange numbers. It would have been too much ceremony. They shared the minute, and when Lianne walked away, she did it like she owned her own gravity.\n\nNight was an animal with two heads when she got back to the hotel. One head wanted sleep, heavy and uncomplicated. The other wanted a walk, to shake the footprint of the day off like a dog in water. She compromised by going downstairs and standing just under the awning with a tea that had been made by someone who could steep a bag without murdering it. The doorman from earlier gave her a look that was part amusement, part concern. \u201cIt\u2019s a river night,\u201d he said conversationally, as if the Thames had moods like a teenager, \u201cthe kind where it\u2019ll pull on your shoelaces if you stand too close.\u201d She smiled at the superstition and took two steps back without making it a thing. Her phone buzzed. Unknown number, local. The voicemail that followed was briefly a pocket and then a voice, a man\u2019s, pitched pleasant, like a disc jockey in the wrong decade. \u201cYou\u2019re nearly there,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t be boring now.\u201d There was a clink in the background, glass on wood maybe, maybe an ice bucket being misused. Then a soft little sound she couldn\u2019t place because the phone\u2019s microphone made sands of certain noises. She didn\u2019t save it. She recorded the number and handed it to Kamal in the morning like a spare part.\n\nLondon did what cities do and carried on effervescing. The morning showed up with a face like it didn\u2019t owe anyone anything. Tom brought her a list of last-minute changes in margins too small for human eyes and read them out loud anyway because he liked to hear his own competence in the air. The open came earlier. The camera in the wings had died a little death and been resurrected by someone who called all cameras she and patted them like horses. A comedian from Leeds made a joke that offended a nation and then apologized ten seconds later in a way that offended another. Maya grew a second pen behind her ear and rewrote reality on notecards without breaking eye contact with anyone.\n\nAn hour before the dress rehearsal, Shiloh texted a screenshot from a forum Rayna had promised herself she would never read. A thread title in fonts so ugly that they felt like an affront read: WHO IS A. BOWMAN? The posters argued like families in kitchens. Some said the name belonged to an agent who had once run a scam where he sold people their own faith back at a markup. Others said it was a producer from a smaller show whose contestants had had flowers left at their doors and who had, three months into it, fled the industry to open a shop in Kent that sold jam and resentment. One post was a photo of a wristwatch caught in a mirror, the kind with a thin black band and a chip in the crystal at two o\u2019clock, and underneath the photo someone had written: look for this. Shiloh\u2019s message underneath the screenshot said, before you say anything, I\u2019m on it, and also, do not go anywhere alone, which made her want to go everywhere alone immediately because she was perverse and because fear sometimes wears the mask of endurance and calls itself independence.\n\nShe allowed the suit jacket to sit on her shoulders like it had been born there. She allowed the shirt to be buttoned, the collar to be coaxed, the hair to be tilted on purpose in a way that would read well from the mezzanine. She took her guitar from its case and inhaled the warm-wood smell that had become as familiar to her as any childhood kitchen. She checked the frets with her thumb the way she always did, small, secret intimacies between object and hand. When she stepped into the wings, the auditorium looked like a sea bed again, waiting for something to chime. A runner whispered into the air that they were at a five, which meant less than five and also more than five, depending on who you asked. Lianne passed her, eyes bright like someone who had looked their nerves in the face and patted them on the head. \u201cBeside,\u201d she said, and Rayna nodded, and for a second the whole enterprise felt like a science experiment they might pull off without blowing up the lab.\n\nAt two, with the orchestra under the stage tuning itself into one shared breath, Tom pressed something into her palm. It was small and round and cool\u2014the lucky coin she\u2019d written on her list and then forgotten in her desk drawer in Los Angeles. She blinked up at him. He shrugged like a man pleased by his own theft. \u201cNikki mailed it, same-day, at a cost that could have bought a small horse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt came at reception twenty minutes ago with a note that calls me an angel and says you\u2019re not to get sappy about it because she\u2019ll die of secondhand sentiment. I took the liberty of screening it,\u201d he added lightly, which was a joke that wasn\u2019t a joke. \u201cNo other stowaways in the envelope.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my favorite flu,\u201d Rayna told him, and he blushed at the absurdity. She slid the coin into the watch pocket she never used and felt the taste of home like sugar at the back of the mouth. The floor manager held up fingers. Three. Then two. Then one. The audience in dress was a fiction telling the truth loudly. The cameras woke like animals with good training. The universe tightened itself so it wouldn\u2019t leak. Rayna walked to her mark and the mic found her mouth and she thought of a woman in a plane seat pressed against a window, a chorus girl ghosting the glass, whispering about a river, and she thought of a boy in Manchester writing a letter that made his own heart tap like a moth. She thought of her mother\u2019s hands rinsing a glass until it shone and of Nikki\u2019s voice bending like a spoon where laughter got too big. She thought of a blue suit with its tag unpicked sitting like a dare in an office. She thought of the red suspenders in her bag waiting like old trouble. She thought of the way a city can take what you haven\u2019t decided and hold it up so you have to look.\n\nAnd then she sang. She sang as if the room had a secret and the only way to get it to tell was to offer it a better one. She sang the way she breathed when she forgot to be nice about it. She saw somewhere in the movement of the dark audience a shoulder that might have been any shoulder and a glint on a wrist that could have been glass or a chip in a crystal at two. She did not let her hand tighten on the pick. She let it sit like a bird that could fly away if it wanted, and trusted that it, like everything else worth keeping, would understand that staying is a choice you make again and again and again.\n\nAfter, the room bled applause in the way rooms do when everyone is glad to be made into one animal. Backstage, Lianne laughed without sound and bumped her hip into Rayna\u2019s hip like girls on a playground. Maya squeezed her forearm, hard, quick, and then went to put out the next, inevitable fire. Kamal materialized and did a sweep of the corridor with his eyes that would have missed nothing. A runner tripped, then righted herself and kept going with the stamina of a saint and the language of a sailor. Somewhere, the magician swore because a coin had done the one thing coins are known for not doing. Somewhere else, a child sang along to a hook she hadn\u2019t known she knew. In the dressing room, the suit\u2014her suit, the one she had chosen, not the one someone had chosen for her\u2014hung straight-backed on its hanger like a soldier at ease.\n\nOn the table, beside the flowers the production had delivered with the kind of card that is mostly names in markers, was a small square blue box tied with white ribbon. Nobody had seen it come in. No one ever sees presents arrive until they\u2019ve arrived. There was no note visible. She didn\u2019t touch it. She sat and drank water and told herself a story about patience that she almost believed. Then she took out her phone and took a photo of the box and sent it to Maya and to Kamal and to Shiloh with the caption, we\u2019re opening this together, because she had learned something about together in rooms like this and because the river outside took what it wanted, and she\u2019d decided, for now, to want only what she could still hold after the tide had turned.",

They opened it the way you open a letter from a person you might love who has also disappointed you, with care that felt like suspicion and politeness that had steel in it. Maya waited until Kamal was in the doorway and Pete had shut it with that soft click he had mastered as if doors obeyed gentleness. She pulled the ribbon cleanly rather than untying it, because knotted cord made Rayna think of wrists. The lid lifted and the smell came first, not flowers this time, not lilac or pepper, but the crisp sweet of peppermint, the kind Rose had pressed into Rayna\u2019s palm like a communion. Inside was a tin, old-fashioned, enamel worn at the edges the way a mouth wears down the inside of a cheek. Under it, nested in tissue that had been folded with someone\u2019s attention, lay a watch. It was slim, plain, the kind a person buys who believes in time as a discipline rather than jewelry as a sign. At two o\u2019clock, the crystal had that tiny crescent wound, not enough to keep the hands from moving, enough to remind anyone looking that something once hit it where you could see. The strap was black and narrow, one loop stretched thin like a person who had tugged at it when thinking.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not touch anything we don\u2019t have to,\u201d Maya said, and the restraint in her voice made Rayna\u2019s throat ache with gratitude and rage at the same time. Kamal took photos with a phone that looked like it had been armored in a previous life, angles like evidence, not like memory. Pete handed Maya a pair of gloves he had not had in his pocket ten seconds earlier and she put them on like a surgeon about to reach for a heart. Under the watch, under the peppermint tin, there was a card cut to the size of the box bottom. BLOCK CAPS again, the handwriting that had decided it didn\u2019t want personality now that it wanted power. TIME IS WHAT WE MAKE OF IT, it read. DON\u2019T WASTE OURS. WE ARE NEARER THAN YOU THINK. The plural was an affectation or a threat or both. Rayna felt her jaw hinge go tight and she made it loose again because she had been told twice since arriving in this building that her jaw told stories she did not want to tell for free.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the chip,\u201d she said, because naming a thing made part of it smaller. \u201cFrom the forum Shiloh sent. It\u2019s him or a very committed imitator.\u201d\n\nMaya tapped the tin lightly with one finger in its glove and the clink sounded like the start of a song you didn\u2019t want to hear. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to see this,\u201d she offered, but Rayna shook her head, because not seeing was another kind of claim, and she would not give this nameless thing more than it had already taken. The tin came open with the small resistance of a lid that had lived in a pocket, over and over. Inside, instead of candy, were three guitar picks, black, tortoiseshell, blue. The blue had been sanded at one edge the way she sometimes sanded her own so they caught strings in the right way. On the back of the tortoiseshell one, someone had carved a word with something sharp. LOOSEN. The O had been cut too deep, the groove white where the dye had failed to reach. She felt her hand close without meaning to and then breathe itself open because a muscle trained is a muscle saved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to get the police liaison up here now,\u201d Maya said, and when she spoke to someone on her phone, she didn\u2019t say please, but it grew in the gap where it would have usually gone, like a child hearing the word in the way the sentence softened without it. \u201cWe\u2019ll run prints off the tin if he was arrogant, which he is,\u201d she added without inflection. \u201cWe\u2019ll check vendor lists again for entry points. We\u2019ll pull the roster for day staff and night staff, and then we\u2019ll pull the roster for people we think we know and pretend we don\u2019t. Kamal, please station someone in the lift banks. Pete, you\u2019re shadowing to the bathroom and back. No one goes anywhere alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cCopy,\u201d Kamal said in a voice as calm as a glass of milk, and it was that domestic calm that kept Rayna from kicking the table just to hear something break.\n\nThe liaison arrived with a notebook and the air of a man who had been friendly for so long that he could be rude without anyone noticing. He asked questions in neat lines and gave nothing away from his face but the occasional glance toward the box like the peppermint smell had reminded him of a time he wished he hadn\u2019t remembered. \u201cAnonymous gift-giving escalates or it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he said, which was not helpful and also true. \u201cWe\u2019ll keep a presence in public spaces. We\u2019ll liaise with hotel security. We\u2019ll speak to props about the watch\u2014retro, common enough, but that chip is unusual. We\u2019ll be dull where we can be, which is the point.\u201d It was the kind of speech that made people less afraid without making them stupid, and Rayna liked him for it in spite of herself.\n\nAfter he left with the box in a clear bag that looked like a joke about evidence, Maya stayed leaning on the desk for one extra breath, her head tipped back as if she were considering asking the ceiling for help. \u201cI hate this part of the job,\u201d she said, and the frankness of it was another small mercy. \u201cWe build stories out of people. We invite the world to watch them build themselves. And some watcher always mistakes watching for owning. I would like to find a door we can shut that feels like a door, not a curtain.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me go on,\u201d Rayna replied, meaning the stage, meaning the thing that made sense when nothing else did. \u201cLet me make it loud enough that whatever hiss he likes to make sounds small. I don\u2019t want him in here when I\u2019m singing,\u201d she added, and her hand hovered over her chest for a second like an absent-minded saint.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re safe in here,\u201d Maya said, not as a promise she had no right to give, but as intention said out loud to make it more real. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not alone in here. That matters.\u201d\n\nIt should have been enough to sit with other people and let the room have its hum until the part of her that had been braced unclenched. It almost was. Tom appeared with a bowl of pasta that had steamed through its lid and said he had threatened caterers with public shaming if they dared to send kale instead of carbohydrate. Lianne slid in with a water bottle covered in stickers so battered they had become abstract art and talked about ankles like a person who could recite the names of bones in her sleep. Shiloh, on video, did his trick where he looked into the camera like a man in a painting and promised he would set the internet on fire if anyone printed a single line that made Rayna into a archetype without permission. The world had arranged itself around her in the shape of a net woven by people who had to be tugged and fed and told jokes; it would hold if she let it. The trouble was that once a river decides to drag at your shoelaces, you became aware of your own knots.\n\nThey ran the dress, and the band came up under her like a bodyguard who knew when to step back and when to push someone with elbows. The lights did their flicker trick perfectly which meant they would be petulant later, because lights were like that. The audience in their borrowed enthusiasm did the gasp they had been given to do, and the cameras caught her at the angle the crane operator had promised. In her in-ear, the engineer\u2019s voice murmured numbers, then disappeared the way he was supposed to, a ghost who haunted softly so everyone else could believe in miracles. Halfway through her second song, in the place where her throat opened without her asking, a breath that was not her own hissed in her ear. \u201cDon\u2019t be boring,\u201d it said, the same pleasant wrongness as the voicemail, and for a millimeter of a second, her hand did what it had been warned not to do; it closed. She felt the pick shift and then steadied it with a breath so deliberate it disguised itself as nothing at all. She finished the phrase. She finished the song. She took her pack off in a motion that told none of the audience that she wanted to throw it at a wall, and she handed it to the sound tech with a smile that belonged to stage wives and assassins. \u201cNot yours,\u201d she said quietly, and the engineer went flat and furious in the way of a man who had just realized his house had been burgled while he was making tea in the kitchen.\n\nThey traced the interference to a small patch cable that had not been patched by any of their people. It had been left plugged into a splitter in a rack no one touched if they wanted to live. It was the sort of clever that belonged to someone who knew enough about sound to be arrogant about it without knowing enough to not get caught. The engineer, whose name badge said Jo and whose eyebrows had done all the heavy lifting of expression for years, actually said the words, \u201cHow dare you,\u201d to the metal box like it had a soul. Kamal and a man from Facilities whose name no one ever learned took the cable away under their shirts as if it might be shy of exposure. Pete moved from right shoulder to left in a way that put himself between Rayna and the biggest openings to the room. Maya wrote something on her notepad and ripped the page off to hand it to Security, the rip neat as a verdict.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s touching the rack, he\u2019s registered somewhere,\u201d Jo said, and the quiet in their voice had weight. \u201cOr he thinks he\u2019s invisible, which means he always wanted to be seen more than he says he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Rayna loved Jo in that second the way you love anyone who turns a thought into a dragnet and gets ready to pull.\n\nThe show, like any machine built by a hundred hands, shrugged and kept moving. Lianne came back from her piece with her hair glued to her neck and a look that said she\u2019d paid on time. The magician made the coin reappear inside a lemon and didn\u2019t break the fourth wall except to grin at a child in the front row like they shared a secret that didn\u2019t involve citrus. The aerialist did not get tangled, and the floor manager did a small fist pump in the wing like a man allowing himself a single sin. Time moved the way it moves in theaters, elastic and bossy. Rayna did what she always did when the hum got too loud; she went quiet inside and checked her hands. They were steady now. The tremor had moved somewhere else\u2014into the way she wanted a cigarette although she hadn\u2019t smoked since twenty-five, into the itch along her scalp that meant a fight or a kiss or a song. She drank water and, for once, didn\u2019t want to spit it out because it tasted like television.\n\nWhen they let her go for an hour, the river had turned itself the color of pewter and thought about being still. Pete did the sideways walk while pretending to be behind, and Kamal did the ahead thing that made people split for him like bread. It was too much to ask to be alone; it would have been a luxury for someone with fewer eyes on her body. She walked with them anyway, and they were such different men it made her like them more, a pair of commas instead of a parenthesis around her. On the bridge, rain started the way British rain likes to start, as gossip rather than news. A man with a buggy that squeaked as if it needed forgiveness hustled past; a woman in a coat that had a waistline as arrogant as an old movie looked across at the Eye and sighed like the Swan Boats in Boston had disappointed her personally. Rayna did the thing she wasn\u2019t supposed to and stopped in the middle to look down at the water. She held the stone with one hand, not as if it would save her if she fell, but as if she were taking its temperature.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s close enough,\u201d Kamal said without the scold and with the implication. \u201cI don\u2019t tell you not to sing. You won\u2019t tell me not to keep you out of cold water.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she said, and the smile she gave him was the sort good bartenders collect like tips. \u201cBut I will ask if you believe in rivers that choose.\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe in men who use rivers to excuse their own appetites,\u201d he said mild as milk again, and that was the thing that pulled her back from the edge as effectively as if he had put a hand on her elbow.\n\nThe pep rally for press afterward had the feel of a school gym that had been convinced to wear a suit. Rayna did not let any one voice in her ear become louder than her own. She said things about honoring stages and loving live audiences and the honor of being asked to leap across an ocean to be booed in a different accent. She let the host with the glacier teeth make his joke about Americans and volume and then made a better one that didn\u2019t care if he wanted it. She went upstairs and lay on the carpet again and stared up at the ceiling and let the texture blur until it had stopped looking like something and started looking like a thousand someones from a distance. She didn\u2019t sleep. She pretended to sleep. When her phone rang, she answered before the second buzz and said, \u201cYou are not allowed to die before tomorrow,\u201d which was how Nikki said hello when she was anxious and which made Nikki laugh on the other end so hard she snorted.\n\n\u201cI mailed you something else because apparently my love language is making couriers earn their keep,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cBut you\u2019re not opening it until someone with a badge says it\u2019s boring. Also, I\u2019m watching from two in the morning with a thermos and a cat who thinks British accents are a personal attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cJustice is xenophobic,\u201d Rayna said, and the banality of the sentence was medicine. \u201cI will wear the suspenders you sent me, but only if I can hide them under the suit like a secret only the camera won\u2019t get if it behaves.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Nikki said immediately. \u201cWear your old trouble like an amulet. That way if the blue shows up, it\u2019s on your terms.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always on my terms,\u201d Rayna said, and the sentence had a spine. \u201cTell my mother I ate.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s on the other line,\u201d Nikki said. \u201cShe heard herself in your throat on that call where you said you were okay. She put the phone down and cried and then picked it up and made a list of soups. She\u2019s back to soups, baby. We\u2019re saved.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you were here,\u201d Rayna said in a voice low enough that if anyone had been standing in the doorway they would have had to step inside to hear it.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Nikki said, and then she was gone because time zones and attention spans are laws too.\n\nMorning was a machine with many switches. They flipped all of them. Hair, face, throat, hands. Tom appeared with a small bag of raw ginger and a look that said he had fought a dragon in a produce aisle, and Maya appeared with a walkie clipped to a pocket that had started to sag from responsibility. The doorman downstairs said the river was being good today and then shook his head because he felt like he had invited it to be bad by naming it. The liaison checked in and said there had been a man who had tried to flirt with a camera operator by pretending to know her rig and had disappeared when she had asked a question about sensor size. They were reviewing footage. They were talking to Facts rather than Feelings, which was exactly how it should be and also never enough.\n\nIn the hall, someone had taped a new sign over the old one that said Stage Left. The new one said Left, Love, in someone else\u2019s handwriting, the kind that wasn\u2019t afraid of itself. Rayna laughed because superstition needed to be fed sometimes and that was a kindness. She put the coin in its place. She stood at the tape cross that had become hers the way a place becomes yours simply by the fact of your body holding it often enough, and she rolled her shoulders and she let her mouth relax on the vowels she always rushed. Jo\u2019s voice in her ear was the right shape again, nothing added. She saw Lianne in the wing, bent forward, arms long, the shape dancers have when they are saying sorry to physics and getting away with it. She saw Maya at the monitor, still as if she had roots somewhere and could afford to stop moving for a second. She saw Kamal where he always was, in the place where problems start if they\u2019re going to start, wearing patience like a uniform under the uniform.\n\nThe host said her name in the shape London made it, flat and respectful and a little skeptical, as if it were sure it would be won over but wanted to make her earn it. The crowd opened their mouths like birds taught that sound was food and she threw a piece of herself to them and they caught it and didn\u2019t tear each other apart for it, which is always a small miracle when it happens. She took a breath. The first chord hit like a door shut without anger. Her voice came, and it came the way she had promised herself it would, not borrowed, not bought, hers, the thing she had kept when other things had been lifted. She watched the first row turn into a second and a third and then blur into heat. The crane swung left lazy as summer and she looked up into it like she was flirting with the sun because the operator liked to say that was what she was doing anyway. The bridge arrived, the one that had failed and succeeded enough times that it had a knot in the middle like a healed bone, and she stepped into it with her eyes open and her hands sure.\n\nSomewhere, at the ragged edge of the darkness, a single face came into too much focus and then away. A man whose age could have been anything between thirty and forty because he had the kind of face that had made a habit of being no one, hair cut short because scissors were cheap, skin the gray-pink of a person who lives indoors. He wore a jacket that at first looked like crew and then didn\u2019t if you knew where to look. At his wrist, when he raised it to scratch the back of his head as if he were simply listening, light caught and broke on the glass where two o\u2019clock lived. He smiled in the way skull patches smile when whoever designed them forgot that grins are about teeth and eyes and the skin around them, not just the idea of a mouth. She did not tighten. She did not flinch. She let the note come out of her mouth and placed it down like a mug she intended to wash later. It was only when she hit the last consonant that the part of her that wasn\u2019t singing took his picture with a part of her that didn\u2019t need a camera to remember.\n\nBackstage, oxygen did what it does when rooms have been taught to applaud. Everyone clapped each other\u2019s backs because clapping is contagious behind the scenes, not because anyone needs the noise, but because bodies need to do something with the charge that isn\u2019t shouting. Maya did the forearm squeeze, and Tom went to fetch the thing he had forgotten to fetch the minute he\u2019d been told not to forget it, and Jo removed Rayna\u2019s pack with tenderness that would have embarrassed them both if either of them had been the sort of person who embarrassed. Lianne grinned with all her teeth and then, because she had ritual, went to a small bin and threw up cleanly and came back looking like the kind of saint who doesn\u2019t believe in suffering for its own sake.\n\nThere was a moment, just before the winners\u2019 music, where the hall shifted and the world leaned to the left the way it does when you\u2019re on a boat and the shoreline proves itself to be something you can touch. The liaison appeared in the wing and made a face like he had bitten a lemon that proved his point. He held up a hand with a small plastic card pinched between forefinger and thumb. It was a pass, laminate corners nicked, lanyard frayed the way fabric frays when it lives around necks that sweat. The name block read ANDREW BOWMAN in ghosted capitals and underneath, in smaller letters, the word Lighting. The photo had been taken by someone who didn\u2019t like taking photos; the man in it stared at an off-place dot like he hoped it would tell him what to feel. In the picture, the watch face was not visible, but you could see the shadow of a strap near the cuff. The liaison\u2019s eyebrows went up, question living there without being asked. Kamal\u2019s mouth did not move, but the yes in the line of his neck was a knot waved loose.\n\n\u201cFound where?\u201d Maya said softly, and the liaison\u2019s mouth answered with three words and a gesture that meant too much information and not enough. Back corridor. Fuse cupboard. Again. The again was a weight they all felt. They did not cartwheel. They did not collapse. They all took a breath at the same time as if someone had called out one-two-three in a game that had borrowed its rules from combat drills.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not getting clever,\u201d Maya said quietly enough that only the four of them heard it. \u201cWe\u2019re getting safe, and then we\u2019re getting boring, and then later maybe I will allow myself the luxury of saying out loud that I am angry. For now, we will walk her to the panel. We will get her off the stage. And we will let the cops do their job without inviting them to do mine.\u201d She looked at Rayna and let her face soften for exactly one second. \u201cYou were not boring,\u201d she added, as if the haunter had been the one to set the assignment.\n\nThey moved. The cameras were back on, and the room did that thing where it thinks it is part church, part casino, part high school assembly, depending on which camera is looking at it. The host made his filler noise. The judges gave pronouncements dressed up as insight, and Rayna listened with her head cocked just enough to communicate affection without surrender. The crowd made the sound a crowd makes when it wants to be part of the decision and also wants to be told what it has decided. It was a relief to have a thing like scores, like numbers a person could hold in their hand and then argue with later at a kebab truck. It was a relief to let herself be one person among many, instead of one person against the dark.\n\nThe verdicts landed where they landed. Some landed with a thunk, some with a cheer that sounded like it could have been recorded last year and played now and no one would know the difference. When she was permitted to leave her mark, she did so without looking back into the house because that is how you keep from making eye contact with ghosts. In the corridor, her hands shook and she let them and then told them that was enough. Pete did the thing where he told a joke that was only funny because of how flat he made it, and Kamal pointed out the quickest route to a room with a door that had a lock that actually made a noise when you turned it. Inside that small square of safety, the midnight suit on its hanger had turned into the kind of blue night sometimes does when it remembers to be tender. The suspenders lay in the bag like a dare with old lipstick on it. On the table, where the blue box had been, there was nothing now but a bottle of water and the card from wardrobe that listed what garment went with what in a handwriting that had kind curves. For a second, she allowed herself to feel lucky in the ordinary way of a person who likes their shoes and has a key that fits and knows they will go to sleep and wake up and have a voice tomorrow that feels like theirs. For a second, the river outside could have been any river where lovers meet and children drop sticks to see which one wins and old men piss into it and pretend they\u2019ve hit the sea.\n\nThe knock on the door was gentle enough that she would have missed it if she\u2019d been singing to herself. She wasn\u2019t. She heard it. She looked at Kamal and he looked at the door and then at her and then opened it two inches with his body a piece of architecture in the gap. Tom peered around his arm like a periscope. \u201cPost-show snack,\u201d he announced, and the relief of it made the room lighter by a measurable degree. \u201cAnd a note from someone with manners for once,\u201d he added, holding up a card with a ribbon that had been tied by a person who understood bows. Inside, in looping, ordinary cursive that belonged to a real hand that had probably written report cards or lists of guests at weddings, someone had written: You were beautiful. From Rose, row F, seat 12. Peppermints soon. The laugh that punched through her chest was clean. She took the note and kissed it because she damned well could. She tucked it into her pocket with the coin. She ate a sandwich like someone who had survived a small battle and wasn\u2019t too proud to count chewing as a victory.\n\nLater, when the building had started to empty itself of noise, the liaison came back with the part of his face that did expressing wearing a shape that could have been hope\u2019s cousin. \u201cWe have a conversation with someone,\u201d he said, and the cautious plural did not feel like the other man\u2019s plural, the one in the notes. \u201cWe might be very bored tomorrow,\u201d he added, and when he smiled, finally, it was tired and human and made his eyes look like someone had decided to stand down from a post and go home for dinner. Maya didn\u2019t clap. No one clapped. It felt like winning a point in a match that had more sets than any of them had understood. It felt like a pause in a piece rather than its end, but a pause that had let breath back into the room.\n\nOn the way back to the hotel, past the river that had decided to play quiet after all, Rayna leaned her head against the cold of the car window and let her breath fog the glass the way Rose\u2019s hand had fogged it at thirty thousand feet. She drew a line in the fog with her finger without meaning to and the line curved itself into a treble clef because her hand had habits. She thought about boys from Manchester and girls under bridges and women who write notes in neat cursive because their hands learned early that kindness is legible when you spell it. She thought about blue and red and midnight and the colors in between that no one bothers to name because they don\u2019t make good paint chips. She thought about the watch ticking somewhere in a plastic bag and a peppermint tin that had nothing sweet in it, and she thought about the old man in corduroy who had smelled like good cigars and old notebooks, and she thought about her mother rinsing out soup pots like they owed her money. She thought about Nikki\u2019s cat on a grocery bag with his eyes half-closed as if he could see all the way to London and had decided to forgive it for existing only because she was in it.\n\nIn the lobby, the doorman nodded like he had been keeping watch for her specifically, which he probably had because some jobs make you pay that kind of attention whether you meant to or not. In the lift, the mirror was kinder than some mirrors. On her floor, the carpet remembered her steps. In her room, the river showed its back like a dog that had decided it could sleep now. On the desk, under the lamp that had the particular shade of yellow hotels prefer because it makes everyone look more like themselves and less like a television star caught in a storm, there was another square box. White this time, no ribbon, no note visible. Her chest went cold and then good sense came back with its coat on. She didn\u2019t touch it. She called Maya. She called Kamal. She took a photo and sent it. Then, because she had decided what kind of person she wanted to be in rooms like this, she pulled the chair away from the desk, sat with her back to the river, and began to tune her guitar one more time, slowly, methodically, E to E, Andrew to A. She let the sound fill the room until the walls remembered who lived there now. She stayed with it. She did not rush. When the door opened and the two of them came in with their tired and their competence, she did not stop. \u201cI will finish this,\u201d she said the way you tell a patient you will finish the stitch you\u2019ve started rather than leaving them half-closed. \u201cAnd then we\u2019ll see what\u2019s inside.\u201d She played the last string true and let it ring out, the note sitting on the table between the three of them like something alive. Then she set the guitar down, stood up, and reached for the box with both hands.",

                              "content": "Chapter Seven\n\nThe lid came up and the room didn\u2019t explode. It sighed. Tissue parted with the small dry hush of a good secret. Inside lay a metal tube of glue with a red cap and a label that announced in earnest sans serif that it could hold soles and souls to their proper places. Beside it: a stout needle curved like a decision, a card of waxed thread the color of asphalt after rain, two rectangles of leather punched for stitching, a bone folder smooth from being handled by hands that took care, and a note in Nikki\u2019s cantankerous print that had gotten prettier only because she had made it practice, not because she cared.\n\nGlue your inner life, she\u2019d written. Also, fix the damn shoe. PS: Peppermints are a gateway drug. PPS: I will personally fight any man with a watch.\n\nRayna\u2019s laugh broke clean in her throat, scandalizing the heat of her own chest. The relief in the room was not dramatic; it was honest. Maya let her shoulders fall a millimeter and then made them professional again. Kamal leaned, peered in as if he were an art critic considering a relic, and gave a single nod like a guard signing for a delivery he had ordered without remembering. Pete made a small noise that might have been happiness and might have been the muscles around his eyes remembering how to move.\n\n\u201cThis is my favorite kind of weapon,\u201d Maya said dryly. \u201cOne that fixes and does not break. Who sends cobbler kits anymore? Nikki is either a witch or a Girl Scout from an alternate timeline.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s both.\u201d Rayna picked up the bone folder and ran her thumb along its edge. It was such a reasonable object it made her tongue taste like good sense. \u201cAnd she\u2019s right. My shoe is preaching surrender.\u201d She lifted the offender, the left one with the shy mouth at the toe, and set the kit on the table like a ritual. \u201cGive me five minutes,\u201d she said, which, in a world organized by other people\u2019s minutes, was a small rebellion and a bigger prayer. They gave her ten, because sometimes the kindness you can offer is an extra measure of time.\n\nShe patched quietly, the way you speak to a child you shamed by rushing him. The glue had that solvent bite that could get a person high if they were sloppy; she used it the way her mother had used bleach, with respect and a window open. The needle pushed through leather like a little ship insisting on its river. Thread ran sure because it had been waxed to obey. The act of repair shifted something inside her. It was not subtle. It was also not performance. She pressed the seam with the bone tool and imagined her sternum getting the same attention, old gesture lines smoothed until the surface looked more like itself.\n\n\u201cShoemaker, heal thy walking,\u201d Tom said from the doorway where he had come with a schedule and stayed for the sacrament. He did not deserve to be that pleased with himself. He wasn\u2019t, not really. He swallowed the next pun politely and held out his phone with an apologetic glance. \u201cPolice liaison,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have news that will be hours old by the time it hits anyone else\u2019s ears.\u201d\n\nThe liaison looked less carved from public service and more like a man with a sister who\u2019d taught him how to braid hair while they watched television. \u201cWe have him,\u201d he said, skipping a preface because he could tell what would serve. \u201cAndrew Bowman. Freelance lighting. Worked a load-in three seasons ago on a sponsor event, enough to talk his way past people who believe in their own memories. Caught him near the fuse cupboard again, this time with a lanyard he\u2019d altered and a pocket full of treats that are not treats. He has a story. They always do. Yours is that he was \u2018assisting\u2019 and you weren\u2019t listening.\u201d He glanced down at his notes to lift a quote. \u201c\u2018You Americans,\u2019\u201d he read in the mild voice of a man who had heard every version of every bad sentence, \u201c\u2018you want things to be obvious. Art isn\u2019t obvious. I was giving her shape.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cShape,\u201d Maya said, flat as paper. \u201cHe used a word like shape while holding a counterfeit pass.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says the watch is his gift to himself,\u201d the liaison continued, passing over a detail without daring it to get bigger. \u201cHe will insist the peppermint tin belonged to his grandmother and the picks are a professional courtesy. He says \u2018we\u2019 to sound less alone. We have precisely one Andrew Bowman,\u201d he added, and the plural changed character entirely when he said it, more useful, less threat.\n\n\u201cCharges?\u201d Kamal asked, already doing math with the unsexy variables of a city and a show and a building that had too many doors.\n\n\u201cWe have him on trespass. We have him on tampering with equipment. We likely have him on harassment if you are willing to sign.\u201d The liaison kept his voice in the place where choice lives. \u201cThe rest is a story. Stories can carry weight. They don\u2019t always carry court.\u201d\n\n\u201cSign,\u201d Maya said, looking at Rayna with the question visible anyway, and Rayna didn\u2019t need the word.\n\n\u201cSign,\u201d she agreed. \u201cI\u2019m not building an altar in his honor. I\u2019m building a fence.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd a stage,\u201d the liaison said, and smiled once so she could see he knew the difference.\n\nThe machine did what machines do; it absorbed new facts and kept turning. The final bore down like a train you could see for miles that still took you by surprise when it was suddenly the only thing in your field of view. Wardrobe did their liturgy with chalk and pins. The midnight suit hung on its hanger with the kind of patience that belonged to older cities. The red suspenders lay in the bag under the chair, and every time Rayna walked past she could feel them calling her name the way old temptations put on new excuses. She told Maya she wanted to wear them under the jacket, not as a costume, but as a scaffolding. Maya\u2019s smile bent toward feral and then straightened. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I tell a sponsor who believes in muted tones,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cBut it is what I tell myself, and it\u2019s what I tell you. Put your dare where it will keep your spine honest.\u201d\n\nThey ran through camera positions the way a pilot runs through checklists; competent people saying the same words in the same order because that is how you keep a thing from becoming chaos. Jo said good morning in her ear and her voice did not crackle with the interference of someone else\u2019s arrogance. The magician had put the lemon away because Maya had frowned at citrus and then relented because the lemon had a booking. Lianne stretched long as a promise and then shorter as if she had decided the floor must be seduced and not stunned. Tom bit into a biscuit with the face of a man having an affair with sugar and then offered half around like an apology to the gods of fiber.\n\nAn hour before call, they fed them to press. The questions wore the same suits they always wear but had cleaner collars because finals bring out the starch in everyone. Are you here to win? Are you here to be seen? What will America think? What will London think of what America thinks? Rayna did the trick she had learned: tell one true thing that sounds like two and smile like nobody has earned your bashfulness. \u201cI\u2019m here to do a thing only I can do,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m here to see if a room can hold it.\u201d She did not say, I\u2019m here to learn whether fear tastes different in a different country because the journalist from Yorkshire would have turned it into a headline about therapy when all it was was breath with corners.\n\nWhen she lifted her head in the lobby afterward, she saw Rose arranged like a secret on a sofa that had been designed to behave like a riverbank. The older woman looked brighter somehow, as if the city\u2019s light had decided to try itself on her skin. She wore a coat the color of a robin\u2019s egg and had a small paper bag tucked neat beside her like a countrywoman guarding cakes on a train. \u201cYou are busier than I am,\u201d Rose said by way of greeting. \u201cI had to tell a young man in a baseball cap a sentence so sharp and true that he apologized on behalf of all his hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have paid to see that,\u201d Rayna said, sitting down in the space Rose made the way people make space for their own, instinct, without mathematics. \u201cYou came. You said you would.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not like to lie unless there is a good punchline,\u201d Rose said, and handed over the bag. Peppermints, hoarded, wrapped inside their own crinkle symphony. \u201cFor the church,\u201d she added, nodding toward the building without irony.\n\n\u201cThey caught him,\u201d Rayna said after a beat because she wasn\u2019t about to feed the river of rumor, but she would tell truth to the woman who had told her about water that takes and keeps. \u201cThe person who wanted my show to belong to him before it belonged to me. At least, they caught one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course they did,\u201d Rose said with the certainty of a woman who has survived stubborn without becoming it. \u201cMen like that always forget the difference between being seen and being watched. It\u2019s the forgetting that makes them sloppy. Forgive me if I am unkind,\u201d she added, and her eyes had pity in them that did not contradict the steel. \u201cI like to be unkind sometimes because it keeps my kindness honest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve earned all your adjectives,\u201d Rayna said. She tucked the mints in her breast pocket the way a soldier tucks letters. \u201cRose, if I look at the river tonight and it looks back, what do I do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say \u2018I know you,\u2019\u201d Rose said promptly, \u201cand then you turn away before it thinks it has won.\u201d\n\nThe day gathered itself. Sound check stained the air with frequencies only bats and people who had chosen this life could hear. The audience began to arrive in clumps, their coats explaining their relationships to each other better than introductions would have. A mother looked at her daughter\u2019s eyeliner with humor and resignation; a boyfriend tried to pretend he didn\u2019t care where the toilets were; a teenager held a homemade sign that wavered between RAYNA ROCKS and ANTHONY FTW in the way of democracy. Backstage, people went quiet in the way people go quiet when the rooms they haunt are about to fill with strangers. A make-up brush turned one person into another kind of person. A costumer made a safety pin into a promise. A stage manager made a call sheet into scripture.\n\nThe suspenders, when she slid them over her shoulders, felt like muscle memory and a dare. The jacket went on over them with the weight of someone else\u2019s blessing. She stood in front of a mirror that had been meant for men taller than she was and let it see her. When she smiled at it, the smile didn\u2019t ask permission. She checked the coin in its pocket. It lay there like a secret that had been told to the right person at the right time and had forgiven the telling. She breathed once, very slowly, and then fast twice because breath liked a little variety.\n\n\u201cYou need anything?\u201d Maya asked from the door, which is the kind of question that makes people ask for impossible things and then forgive you for not being God.\n\n\u201cA small boat,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cFailing that, your opinion. If I flash red they will say I staged it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou stage everything,\u201d Maya replied, unoffended. \u201cThat\u2019s what a stage is for. Show what you need. There is no jury that matters more than the one under your ribs.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the river,\u201d Rayna said, only half a joke. Maya\u2019s mouth tilted.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not brave enough to argue with water,\u201d she said, and touched two fingers to the doorframe like a widow practicing a religion only she liked.\n\nCall time is a lie. Call time is when you are already called. They pulled her into position with good hands. Jo\u2019s voice, quick and flat as a right answer, warmed her ear. The cranes mothered into their arcs. The host said words that meant numbers. The judges smiled with their teeth on; the crowd was a thousand small weathers adding up to a storm. Lianne touched the back of Rayna\u2019s elbow and squeezed once, a simple voltage exchange that said beside and go wreck them in a language without grammar.\n\nThe first chord landed right where it should have, like keys in a catch that had been oiled after a winter of sticking. The sound climbed into the ribs of the building and found old singing there and curled up close. Rayna let the verse be stingy because she knew the chorus would give like a grandmother with hands full of candy. In the second line, where she always wanted to speed because speed is a kind of courage until it isn\u2019t, she forced her breath to widen and the vowel to sit back on its heels. The camera loved her jaw angle without the tightness in it that had made the crane operator scold. She did not look for a watch. She looked into the dark the way you look into a friend who lets you have your own face. The bridge arrived, the flash point. She dragged a knuckle under the hem of the jacket with a motion that could have been fidgeting and was not, and let red blink like a gasp. The room inhaled. That was the point. She took the last corners at speed and made the words land soft anyway. She put the final consonant on the shelf like a bowl she would use later. She didn\u2019t drop it. She didn\u2019t throw it. She placed it down so gently people could hear the mercy in it.\n\nOn the other side of the noise, the judges did their choreography. Praise dressed up as criticism so their fans could pretend to disagree. Questions about America\u2019s habit of arriving late and loud, answered with a joke about British menus not warning her about peas. Compliment disguised as curiosity that let her say a line about builders and bar owners and Baruch atah Adonai because her first chord had been learned under a neon that buzzed like prayer. It was television. It was also real. Both things are allowed. When they sent her away from the X, she could feel her blood under her skin like a river that had decided to be generous for an hour.\n\nBack in the corridor that smelled faintly of hairspray and trumpet, Kamal said, \u201cWe\u2019re good,\u201d in a tone that meant dozens of moving parts had done what they had promised and he was, for a second, letting himself consider trust. Pete made a face that approximated relief without giving away his habit of worrying as a sport. Tom mouthed nailed at her from the end of a hall and then looked embarrassed because men from his neighborhood only mouthed things at sports teams and the word luck. Lianne leaned her shoulder into Rayna\u2019s shoulder and let it rest there long enough for a little electricity to go home.\n\nThe rest of the acts took their turns. The aerialist spun grief into geometry. The magician improved the lemon, or the lemon improved the magician. A singer with a throat made of velvet and trauma stood and shook the room until it remembered how to cry politely. A child played drums like someone who had found a safe way to be angry. The audience did what audiences do and fell in and out of love with perfect freedom. Somewhere in the middle of it, the liaison slid by with a tilt of his head that said boring in the way a surgeon says successful. Somewhere toward the end, Maya touched the earpiece that connected her to a dozen voices and closed her eyes for a heartbeat in a way that looked like a prayer and was merely arithmetic.\n\nResults come as if they are weather purchased in bulk. They take forever and then they happen, and you do not get to be the person who controls the lever even if you have written the song. They lined up on the tape crosses that had their names under them on laminate. The host anesthetized them with words. The cameras practiced tenderness. The crowd tried to cause an earthquake by clapping in time. Rayna\u2019s coin sat warm in her pocket like a friend who had never learned tact and therefore made the best sort of ally. She breathed on counts even her fingers didn\u2019t need. She reminded herself that winning and next were different words on purpose. She also wanted it\u2014wanted the yes, wanted the bright green checkmark, wanted proof she could screenshot and send to a mother with soups. Want is not shameful if it doesn\u2019t make you cruel.\n\nThe show drew the last syllables out of the night and held them until the lights ached. The river outside went about its slow nasty business of pretending it had nothing to do with them. Rose sat somewhere in row F with peppermints in a bag and sensible shoes on her feet, aged like the good kind of wood. Nikki\u2019s cat kneaded a grocery bag until it fell in love. Andrew Bowman sat in a small room with cinderblock walls and told a story to a man with a tape recorder that will never sound as compelling on replay as it did in his head. Maya counted breaths backwards from a hundred and did not lose her place. Lianne rolled her ankles and thought about the years she had stolen back from pain by refusing to become it. Shiloh punched a couch pillow and then apologized to the couch pillow because it was not the villain. Rayna stood upright and let the cameras have the side of her face that forgave easily.\n\n\u201cAnd the winner,\u201d the host said in a tone that belonged to game shows and ringmasters and men who make a living asking other people to breathe wrong, \u201cof Britain\u2019s Got Talent\u2026\u201d\n\nThe room leaned. The noise leaned. The lights focused until they were an idea. Rayna\u2019s heart did not race so much as decide, firmly, to be present. Her jaw relaxed because the crane operator had taught her to love her vowels. The coin warmed like a sun at the bottom of a pocket. Her hand did not tighten. She did not look for a watch. She looked at the space just above the camera\u2019s glass where a little red light told the room when it was their turn to exist and lifted her chin half an inch as if to sniff the future. The name came. It was a sound that belonged to a person and a family and a set of hands and a city. It was not hers. It was also, somehow, not an insult.\n\nThe crowd did what crowds do when a thing has been decided by committee and desire. The sound rose and hardened and then softened again around the edges because kindness is fashionable at finales. The winner burst like a person who hadn\u2019t rehearsed it because you never can. The confetti cannons, which had been waiting since morning with a tension that creeps into machines with long, boring lives punctuated by fury, obeyed their cues. Gold fell on everyone in the way money never truly does. Rayna smiled the exact smile she ought to have smiled and meant it by sixty percent and grew the other forty because she believed in tipping the jar.\n\nBackstage was different because winners make gravity bend. She moved through with a measure that made people think of water poured into a glass rather than whitewater. Maya met her in the first quiet and didn\u2019t reach for the script at the corner of her mouth; she let it be. \u201cYou were a stone,\u201d she said, and it was not a clich\u00e9 but a diagnosis. \u201cA good one. The kind that knows it\u2019s heavy enough to be a place to sit. He will be furious,\u201d she added half an inch under the surface, the He unspecific and specific enough, \u201cbut only with himself, and he will have to find other rivers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not be boring,\u201d Rayna said, and it finally sounded like a vow to her own bones, not a retort to someone else\u2019s dare. \u201cHe can write his poems to a wall. I have work.\u201d\n\nWork looked like a phone that would not stop, like a string of messages from cities that were not this city, like a label assistant with a face like a Malamute asking about meetings, like Shiloh text-exploding with words like momentum and headline and cover, like Nikki typing ALL CAPS until her vowels broke. Work looked like a cab at three in the morning and a plane tomorrow and a mother who would pretend not to cry and then cry. Work looked like a river that lived on the opposite side of an ocean and benches with gum under them she could recognize blind.\n\nBefore she left the building, she went back onstage once with no one in the seats and stood at her mark and put her palm flat on the floor. It was cool and smelled faintly of feet and electricity and oranges from a rider someone had actually used. She whispered, because she wasn\u2019t superstitious and she had learned to indulge who she was anyway, \u201cThank you,\u201d to whoever collected thanks in rooms like this. She did not have to mean it with her whole heart for it to count. She meant it with enough.\n\nOutside, the river had given up trying to be mysterious and gone black and honest. The bridge wore its necklace of lights like a widow back from her first party. The doorman wished her luck as if luck were a garment he could hand her off a hook. Kamal, whose patience had worn into a groove finally, let his mouth settle into a true line of contentment that had no room for triumph. Pete said that he would spend the next week missing the sound of this building\u2019s elevators and then catch himself and be relieved. Tom offered half a biscuit he had saved for just this moment and then laughed at himself because it had gone stale and the sentiment had not.\n\nAt the hotel door, the night clerk lifted his hand in a salute that could have been, if you wanted it to be, the kind of thing men do in old films when ships pull away. In the lift, her mirror self looked tired and looked like someone who didn\u2019t mind. In the room, the river took up its usual position just beyond the glass like a neighbor who always fishes on the same evening. On the desk, there was nothing square. There was a cosseted bowl of fruit and the Welcome! card that had been too cheerful and had outlived its cheer. There was her guitar case, the small scuff on the edge where she had clipped it on a turnstile at home. There was the shoe she had glued, mouth sealed, sermon postponed. It would open again, because that\u2019s what shoes do if you wear them the way she wore her life. She would fix it when it did. Some things need glue. Some things need stitches. Some things need new leather and someone kind to pick out the old thread without sawing the holes bigger.\n\nShe washed her face without wincing at what cameras do to pores because she knew cameras did worse to people who think pores are the story. She took the suspenders off and laid them flat like a flag she had earned the right to fly only when she wanted. She took the coin out of the watch pocket and set it beside Rose\u2019s note. She thought about calling her mother and then didn\u2019t because it was late for better and early for worse and the time in between is when people tell stories they don\u2019t mean yet. She texted instead: Ate. Won enough. Home soon. Love you. Her mother\u2019s answer came back fast and was mostly exclamation points around the word proud, and that was more dangerous than any watch. She held her phone to her chest like a peppermint.\n\nShe slept. She dreamed. The river in the dream was not the Thames and not the one in Venice and not the one she had crossed with her family in a car that backfired like a joke. It was a different river, made of sound and hands and the parts of cities that don\u2019t get photographed. It had a mouth full of silver picks and a wrist where time lives chipped at two. It tried to pull at her laces and she looked at it and said, without anger, \u201cI know you,\u201d and then, like a woman who had learned where to place her feet, she turned away and walked toward a door that opened exactly when she reached it because it was hers.",

Rayna woke before her alarm because nerves have their own calendars, lay still long enough to make sure her body parts agreed with one another, then slid out of bed and into a world that smelled like hotel detergent and last night\u2019s adrenaline cooling into something almost respectable. The river outside had put on its best pewter to make breakfast TV crews feel they\u2019d been given a proper English view. Her phone had turned into a fruit fly trap overnight\u2014unwanted calls and tiny urgent texts bzzing in because everyone she knew had stumbled into the same thought at 3 a.m. and decided that now was a perfectly reasonable time to share it.\n\nMaya had sent a schedule so neat it could have cut paper. BBC breakfast first. Then radio. Then a merciful forty-five-minute hole labeled Breathing. After that, press line in a lobby that tried to smell like money. She added, in an afterthought text that was not an afterthought, eat the beans, don\u2019t argue on air about beans, the nation has an agreement. Rayna laughed into her coffee because even the warning sounded like a small dare. She had never mistrusted a bean but she had misread a culture, once or twice. She pulled the midnight suit on because it had become not just an outfit but a story now, slipped the red suspenders under it with a satisfaction that felt like flossing, tucked the coin into its pocket, and fastened the top button like she was flipping the switch on a machine she\u2019d built herself.\n\nThe BBC couch had the cheerful cruelty of television furniture\u2014bright colors and unforgiving angles that dared you to slouch. The hosts ran on caffeine and choreography, teeth white enough to offend a camera and hair that had never known humidity like a friend. They shook her hand with practiced warmth and told her she was a delight before she\u2019d opened her mouth, which is both a compliment and an accusation if you look at it too closely. The bean bowl glistened in the corner as if it were a sponsor. The man on the left asked if she\u2019d slept. The woman on the right asked if she had a ritual. Rayna gave them both pieces of truth that didn\u2019t cost too much. She hums, she said, not because humming is magic but because it makes her remember she has a throat that isn\u2019t just a hose for other people\u2019s expectations. She sleeps sometimes in the middle of the day, hard and stupid, because night expects too much of her.\n\n\u201cAnd the trousers?\u201d the man said with a grin designed by a team. \u201cYou\u2019ve caused quite a stir online, Ray-na,\u201d he mispronounced it with good cheer, \u201cwith this\u2026 how would you put it\u2026 stud look? That\u2019s what they\u2019re calling it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would put it as getting dressed and leaving my house,\u201d Rayna said, very mildly. \u201cStud is for horses and idiots. I\u2019m a person. Clothes are how I keep myself from being arrested.\u201d\n\nThe woman laughed in the particular way job-secure people laugh\u2014audible, approving, safe. \u201cWe love a girl in a suit,\u201d she said, and then, sensing the shift, amended, \u201cWe love when anyone wears what feels like truth.\u201d They navigated the bean question with the grace of diplomats. Rayna ate one, politely, decided she didn\u2019t have to love it, and told Britain it tasted like Sunday. The man tried to coax her into naming names, winners and losers and who she liked best back there in the thunderdome. She slid away from him without making it look like sliding. \u201cThe thing about talent shows,\u201d she said, \u201cis you get to see how somebody looks at a room when all their practice is finally coming out of their pockets. That\u2019s my favorite part. Who looks up and smiles where they could cry.\u201d\n\nAfterward, in a corridor that had tried to be neutral and failed because beige is a position too, Maya handed her a paper cup and touched the back of her hand with two fingers. It wasn\u2019t a touch that asked for anything; it was the kind that says, hey, I saw. \u201cYou ate the bean,\u201d she said, impressed. \u201cYou did not make enemies out of legumes. We live to book another day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bean and I have an understanding,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cI won\u2019t slander it if it stays out of my guitar.\u201d\n\nRadio tasted like coffee gone cold and wires that had been warmed by other mouths. They sat her across from a man whose smile came through his voice like honey. He had grown up without hearing anyone like her on air, he confessed, and now he kept a list of every person who wrote their own story and brought it to his table. They talked about bus stops and bar owners, about the small holiness of passing a pick to a stranger and hearing them hand back your song in a new shape. He asked, gently, if the \u201csituation\u201d backstage had changed how she felt about being seen. \u201cIt reminded me that ownership is a bad verb for the public to learn,\u201d Rayna said, and the way the engineer in the booth nodded made her feel she had chosen a target worth hitting. \u201cI\u2019m glad someone got bored before anybody got hurt. Boredom is underrated as a weapon.\u201d\n\nWhen the hole labeled Breathing finally arrived, they fled the building to a market that smelled like wet cardboard and miracles. London does markets the way some families do gossip, with vigor and affection and plates involved. Rayna bought a roll that flaked shamefully onto her jacket and a paper cup full of strawberries that had learned to be sweet in a climate that wasn\u2019t trying to help them. She leaned on a railing and watched a busker fight his instrument into tune and lose, then win. He sang a song that had been famous in the nineties, the kind that takes three chords and a lot of forgiveness and makes you feel seventeen no matter how old you are. She couldn\u2019t help it. She threw a coin into his case and the coin was heavier than most. He looked up and his face did the thing faces do when they suddenly recognize a person they have only ever known as a rumor. \u201cNo way,\u201d he said in a whisper that carried. \u201cNo f\u2014\u201d He caught himself mid-swear because there was a toddler nearby chewing on a baguette like a woodworker.\n\n\u201cWay,\u201d Rayna said, not moving. He offered her his guitar. It is rude to say no when a city hands you a little stage. She glanced at Maya who has learned to say yes to the right wrong decisions. Maya lifted both hands in a gesture that meant don\u2019t look at me, I\u2019m not your mother, and also do it, coward. So Rayna took the busker\u2019s battered friend, flexed her fingers to learn its language quickly, tuned with that little flick of her wrist that made old men nod to themselves, and played the first line of the hook that had chased her across an ocean so hard that strangers in Los Angeles kept humming it back at the waves. The market\u2019s sound changed. People do this; when they think they might miss a thing, their bodies try to squeeze back into childhood and they crowd like children at a parade.\n\nShe didn\u2019t play it all because she wasn\u2019t a thief\u2014even of herself. She gave it eight bars of truth and then took a left turn into something older, a song the busker knew how to sing with her, and he did, and he did not embarrass himself, which he will be proud of for the rest of his life and it will be a story he tells to people in kitchens who will pretend to be bored and then go very still. When she handed the guitar back, someone put a tin into the case. It was cheap, bright with the promise of sugar. Rayna reached without thinking because reflex is a kind of love. Peppermints clacked inside. She didn\u2019t have to look up to know who had placed it there, but she did anyway. Rose stood three people back, hands folded over her bag like a triumphant spy.\n\n\u201cYou collect them,\u201d Rose said afterward, when they had been pushed into the eddy beside a flower stall that smelled like apology. \u201cI thought I would add to your hoard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will have to start a black market,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cI will sell them at a markup to BBC hosts and people who have seen God by accident.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou found being here was a blessing after all,\u201d Rose said, and she didn\u2019t make the word sound foolish. \u201cGood. That worries me when people fly over rivers to find work. Blessings can be fickle on arrival.\u201d\n\nRayna looked at her, at the coat the color of eggs meant for spring, at the eyes that had the reckless habit of offering unsolicited truth and making it feel like an heirloom. \u201cTell me about your man in the white suit,\u201d she said softly, because you do not always get a second chance to ask a ghost for a biography.\n\nRose\u2019s smile made a new wrinkle at one corner of her mouth, a good one. \u201cAh,\u201d she said. \u201cMy personal river. He didn\u2019t steal my wallet. He did write me a poem about it later when he realized I had been the one to lift his\u2014men always assume they are the fox in any story. I danced on a ship before I danced on a stage you\u2019d know, because I was seventeen and stubborn and I thought the ocean would make a better companion than a husband who liked the horses. There\u2019s a way men in white suits look at the door on a ship\u2014you see it and you know to stand in front of it if you plan on making it your own. That\u2019s advice and a metaphor, duck. Keep both.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get free?\u201d Rayna asked, because she liked a narrative with an exit.\n\n\u201cI stopped performing for him,\u201d Rose said, shrugging like the motion had taken her twenty years to learn. \u201cPeople like that are audience junkies. When you turn your back they look for another theater. He found one. He bored me so terribly I could have wept with gratitude.\u201d She touched Rayna\u2019s sleeve, brought the fabric between thumb and forefinger as if assessing quality. \u201cYou sing like a person who won\u2019t let boredom become a river. Hold on to that.\u201d\n\nThe press line later felt like a tame stampede. People said her name in the rhythm of strobe lights. She practiced her parry-and-thrust until her arms felt like silk. A tabloid tried to sell her a headline with words like scandal and stalker and she responded with words like system and safety and \u201cSecurity is a profession, not a vibe,\u201d which was not a pull quote but turned out to be the only sentence out of that scrum people wanted to tattoo on their forearms. After, she leaned against a wall that had framed photos of the city from the seventies, everything brown and shaggy and honest, and texted her mother because the gap between time zones had turned into a mouth she could throw her voice into and expect an answer from.\n\nHer mother answered like she\u2019d been sitting on the phone waiting for permission to be proud again. The soup list came out first\u2014carrot, lentil, the fancy one with chickpeas that Rayna had once said tasted like a sweater. Then her mother\u2019s voice did the thing it does when it\u2019s going to say the brave thing without a drumroll. \u201cI was not silly because I could not be,\u201d she said, stepping into the unspoken thing as if she had decided to stop pretending the hallway was a wall. \u201cI was not silly because the pills made me flat and the world made me flatter and then I was embarrassed about being flat because everyone told me I used to be fun. That\u2019s the formula, isn\u2019t it? Woman plus exhaustion plus mother plus man gone equals\u2026 whatever it equals. I am better. I am still tired in the bones because I worked them when they were soft and I didn\u2019t know yet that that makes a different kind of tired. I am saying: forgive me for being less shiny for a while. I am shining again. In my kitchen. It is enough.\u201d\n\nRayna pressed the phone to her ear hard enough that comfort ran in like heat. \u201cYou don\u2019t owe me shimmering,\u201d she said. \u201cYou owed yourself rest. I kept thinking if I sang loud enough it would bounce back at you. That\u2019s not how sound works.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, sometimes,\u201d her mother said softly. \u201cSometimes you have to sing at a person until their inside glass vibrates and remembers it is glass.\u201d She coughed, the old smoker\u2019s there-and-gone cough that startled both of them. \u201cBritish men? Are you being careful?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not collecting any of them,\u201d Rayna promised. \u201cThere is one woman with hair like a small storm who doesn\u2019t give me any choice but to listen when she speaks. I cherish her out loud. That will have to do for now.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d her mother said with a satisfaction that sounded like soup simmering a whole house. \u201cWrite your song. Don\u2019t be boring.\u201d She laughed so hard at herself that the connection fuzzed.\n\nBy late afternoon, the theater had shed its gala skin and put on the one it used for recovery. Cables lay around like snakes between naps. The crane operator sat on a stool eating a sandwich, her biceps relaxed and forgiving. There was a quiet you only get in rooms that have been loud, a hangover hush. Rayna, restless in the way she always was after an event, wandered the corridors, found the fuse cupboard because people had been muttering about it for two days like it was a goblin\u2019s lair, and stood in front of it with Kamal like a pair of burglars who had come to apologize. The door was shut. New locks shone, fresh and overconfident. Someone had taped another sign above the latch, the same hand that had written Left, Love. This one said We See You, which made her spine feel like it had been stretched and brought back to its proper length.\n\n\u201cWant to put a ribbon on it?\u201d Kamal murmured, almost smiling. \u201cMight as well make it a gift to yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Rayna said, and slipped her pick between her fingers, flipping it idly. \u201cI prefer not to feed cupboards. They get ideas.\u201d\n\nShe found Lianne in a rehearsal studio, one of those rooms with mirrors all along one wall like a personality disorder. The dancer had earbuds in and her body in a war with a metronome she had clearly decided to win without casualties. Rayna watched without speaking because you do not interrupt when someone is communing with their instrument, even if their instrument is every tendon they own. Lianne saw her in the glass, not startled, only interested, and beckoned her with a tilt of her head.\n\n\u201cYou look like a person who needs to invent a ritual,\u201d Lianne said, dropping to the floor and stretching her hamstrings until the gods themselves probably begged, gently, for mercy. \u201cBefore you go. Or you will end up packing for four hours and throwing a shoe across a room and weeping because you have to decide whether to take two shirts or three.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many is correct?\u201d Rayna asked, sitting, joining her, because she would try anything once if it made her hands feel less like conduits for electricity.\n\n\u201cTwo. Always two.\u201d Lianne grinned. \u201cOne for who you are. One for who you are telling yourself you will be when you land.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou vomit before shows,\u201d Rayna observed, affection slipping into her voice as if old. \u201cWhat do you do before flights?\u201d\n\n\u201cI look at the safety card and cry a little,\u201d Lianne said cheerfully. \u201cIt\u2019s cathartic. Then I sleep like a saint.\u201d She bent forward like a hinge. \u201cWill you write about us, in the way that means me? Will there be a line where you pretend I am anonymous and then reveal that I am the only person with ankles in London?\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have to invent an ankle for you to be singular,\u201d Rayna said, mock-severe. \u201cLondon is mostly ankles.\u201d\n\nThey did not flirt. Not really. It would have been easy to, and then harder. They sat and breathed together until Rayna could feel her heart settling into the pace of a person, not a performer. Lianne showed her a sequence that pretended to be yoga until you tried it and then it confessed to being survival. Rayna attempted it and made a noise that made them both laugh and made her think of her brothers and how they used to crack each other\u2019s backs in the dark because they could. When she left, she took with her a series of movements she would pretend to have invented back in Los Angeles and give credit for loudly if anyone attempted to praise her for them.\n\nIn her room that night, with the suitcase yawning, the glue kit open like a reliquary, and the suit draped across a chair the way a handsome stranger might drape themselves across your plans, Rayna sat on the carpet and wrote. The song came out sideways at first, the way all new animals do, blinking and damp. She did not write the words he had used at her; she sanded them into her own. Don\u2019t be boring became don\u2019t be borrowed, and then don\u2019t be bartered, and suddenly it made sense why her jaw had hurt that whole first week\u2014she had been clenching against bargains she didn\u2019t intend to make. Loosen became a bridge, not an instruction she resented but a gift she could give herself, a room she could build out of breath. She put the river in, but not as villain; she put it in as witness. She put Rose in the second verse, disguised with a different color coat and a different ship and the same kind of good sense that makes a person stop performing for men in white suits. She put Nikki in as an aside because you cannot write a truth about yourself without the woman who mailed you glue and a weapon shaped like a joke. She put her mother in with soups, the spoon clinking against a pot like time keeping time.\n\nShe wrote until the words didn\u2019t improve with more of them. She stopped before she ruined it. She did the brave thing and did not show it to anyone immediately. She pressed her palm to the page and then left it, a blessing or a handprint fossils might read after the apocalypse and understand that someone had tried to make a sound, and had.\n\nShe slept badly and delightedly at the same time. Her body kept waking up to show her her own life, like a child tugging her sleeve because the moon was out. She got up once to stand by the window and watch the river do its neutral duty. \u201cI know you,\u201d she said again, but this time she didn\u2019t turn away. She let the water have her gaze, and maybe that was the turning. It did not tug at shoelaces through glass. It did not know her name. It kept flowing and she kept standing and the world did not break under the pressure of their mutual stubbornness.\n\nThe day she left was made of seams. Tom appeared at the door with a printed-out airline confirmation and a bag containing a sausage roll wrapped in a napkin with a note in felt-tip that said, For when airplane food tries to ruin your life. Pete had a gift, a small multi-tool in the shape of a credit card that made a joke of every TSA line that would confiscate it. \u201cKeep it in a drawer and think of me when something has a screw loose,\u201d he said, deadpan. Kamal shook her hand the way men do when they wish they touched more people and have trained themselves not to. \u201cIf you come back,\u201d he said, \u201cI will still be here. We like to pretend we are rivers but most of us are stones.\u201d\n\nJo caught her in the corridor and thrust a coil of cable into her hands, cackling when Rayna flinched. \u201cJoke,\u201d Jo said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do that to you. It\u2019s a roll of gaffer tape. You will need it thrice in your life and one of those times will be to fix grace.\u201d\n\nMaya did not do speeches. She does not trust them; she believes in the small sentence delivered with faith instead. \u201cYou owe me one breakfast where nobody is watching,\u201d she said, serious as a check. \u201cYou owe me one song sung into a room that isn\u2019t being eaten by cameras. I owe you the assurance that I will not let anyone else write you while you are in my building. If you want back in the building, that is.\u201d Her eyes had the little light in them again, not a flirt, not not a flirt, something friendlier and more dangerous: respect with teeth. Rayna kissed her on the cheek, quick, sideways, a thing that could be a European affectation if either of them needed it to be. \u201cI\u2019m not done with your country,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I owe my city some noise.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou owe your cat,\u201d Maya said, because she had read her briefings and was not above playing the Justice card.\n\nAt the barrier outside, Ems appeared out of air like a person who had learned to teleport because she wanted it enough. The beanie was a different color this time, green, brave. \u201cYou were everything,\u201d she yelled, then blushed because she hadn\u2019t planned to yell and Brits don\u2019t love yelling in daylight. \u201cMy mum bought leather,\u201d she added in a whisper that was actually a shriek. \u201cIt\u2019s red.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cShe can lend it to you later when she\u2019s ready.\u201d Ems made a face like someone who had planned on not having to deal with that idea for at least three years. Rayna signed her bus ticket instead of her arm. \u201cStay loud in the way that doesn\u2019t make you mean,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick.\u201d Ems nodded with the gravity of a person accepting instructions for a bomb that would go off if you held it wrong and then ran toward a woman waiting with a smile so bright Rayna had to look away.\n\nThe airport did its usual impressions\u2014long snakes of people pretending to be patient, announcements spoken by a voice designed by a committee, the smell of six different kitchens competing to be the one you regret most. The old man in corduroy was not there, but there was a woman with hair like cloud who crocheted without looking and a little boy who pressed both palms to the window when he saw a plane nose like it was the face of a whale. Rayna dropped into a seat near the gate and let her spine be a person lying on soft dirt. She texted Shiloh that she was not doing morning television in New York, not yet, he could scream if he wanted to, and he sent back a gif of a silent scream and then the words proud and feral in that order.\n\nOn the plane, aisle seat again because she liked being able to catch fate by the ankle if it tried to run past, she took the coin out and rubbed it with her thumb. The metal warmed the way coins do when you hold them long enough, familiar and more real for the touch. She slid it back and felt the little weight like punctuation. The woman in the window seat had no ring and a laptop full of slides with bars and pie slices. \u201cWork or holiday?\u201d she asked without wanting to talk, and when Rayna said Work, she nodded the nod of someone who had stacked two weeks of work into three days and knew it was a bad religion and kept practicing anyway. \u201cI envy you your job sometimes,\u201d she said, which is what people say because music looks like a beach if you stand far away from it and don\u2019t count the jellyfish. Rayna smiled and did not inventory the jellyfish. She closed her eyes and saw, not cameras, not faces, but the fuse cupboard with the new lock, Rose\u2019s peppermints, Lianne\u2019s bridge of ankle into ankle, Nikki\u2019s curved needle, Maya\u2019s don\u2019t-make-me-say-please look, Kamal\u2019s milk-quiet voice. She saw the river without dread. She let it be a line that cut the city into two halves that loved each other by arguing about boats. The pilot said words about weather that made people reach for their belts and then forget why they had reached. Wheels lifted. Her chest did the small gratitude trick it always did when the ground let her go without holding grudges.\n\nSomewhere over the Atlantic, as white fields of cloud below pretended they were something more noble than vapor, she opened her notebook. The words she\u2019d written last night were still good. They would need to be edited into something sharper and kinder and more cruel, all at once. She drew a little skull in the margin and gave it kind eyes so it wouldn\u2019t haunt the page like a warning. She wrote Left, Love in the corner, an arrow pointing toward a chord change that would need to be negotiated with patience. She drew a bean, because why not, and a peppermint, because some jokes die without attention. She thought about blue. Not the suit\u2014the color. The idea of it. How she had wanted to reject it because someone else had told her it was hers. How she could take it back now without letting it become a symbol someone else could hang their coat on. She wrote BLUE in block caps and then wrote beneath it, in her own quick hand: mine because I said so, not because you did.\n\nLos Angeles greeted her with the baked bread smell it put on when it wanted to be forgiven for being itself. The city pulled at her shirt like a child showing a drawing. Traffic ran like suspicion. The sky put on its guileless blue in apology for every time it had made her sweat. She breathed with her mouth open because she\u2019d missed the grit. At her building, paint flaking off the railing in a way that made her feel tender instead of mocked, she found a parcel on her doormat wrapped in brown paper and twine because someone was an aesthete in the age of tape. Her name was scrawled in a hand she knew better than her own sometimes. Inside, a jar of soup with a lid sealed tight as a promise, a note from her mother that said, Congratulations, with the word broken into three syllables like a shout, and a photograph that looked old and wasn\u2019t\u2014Nikki had printed the image from a FaceTime she had paused just right, the one where Rayna had tipped her head and smiled with half her mouth and the cat had glared at London from a cushion. On the back, Nikki had written, in her villain handwriting: Next time, bring me. Also, I warded your apartment with garlic and glitter. Don\u2019t be mad.\n\nHer apartment had the stillness of a room that had been missing someone. The guitar smelled more like itself than the hotel carpet had allowed. Justice stalked out of the bedroom with the slow disdain of a person who had been betrayed by a plane and then fed by a friend; he looked at her, did the blink that meant he suspected her of crimes and also worshipped her for the bacon she sometimes dropped. She dropped her suitcase, not gently, because the floor owed her, crossed the room, and lay down on the rug on her back like she had at the hotel and stared at the ceiling that had a little crack in it shaped like a tiny river you wouldn\u2019t notice unless you were the kind of person who noticed cracks.\n\nAcross the street, someone revved a car because they thought it made them important. Somewhere above her, a neighbor decided to vacuum at a time of day that made it an apology. Down the block, a man with a cart called out about oranges he had no intention of lowering his price on, because he had set it five cents below absurd and had no intention of changing his mind. Rayna closed her eyes. The room settled. Her body at last believed that the air she was breathing was the air it was meant to breathe.\n\nShe sat up after a minute because she was not a saint, and fame hates saints, and also because the jet lag had begun to sharpen inside her like a thousand small knives that could only be blunted by movement. She took her glued shoe, inspected it, nodded at her own handiwork because the split stayed sealed. She hung the midnight suit on its hanger and took a photo of it to send to Maya with the caption: I didn\u2019t spill beans on it, like you worried I would, liar. She placed Rose\u2019s note above the kitchen sink with a magnet that said, in the tone of a tattoo, Pay Your Band. She set the peppermint tin\u2014hers, the one with candy, not the one with picks\u2014on the table. She breathed into the room until it had the shape of her again.\n\nNight in Los Angeles is a different animal than London\u2019s. It is bigger and sloppier and less dignified and more forgiving. It doesn\u2019t know about rivers. It knows about traffic, about lawns, about smog that used to be worse. It knows about helicopters and Christmas lights in June and heat that refuses to shut up. Rayna went to the roof because she had missed it and because she had promised the morning on the roof that she would return with a story it could peacock about. The city had put on her grapefruit again: orange into pink, the bowl forever tipped. She strapped the guitar on and played the song she had written over there in the place where a river had challenged her and a man had been caught and a woman had handed over peppermints like relics. The words sat in the air between buildings like laundry. The hook did its job, the way hooks do, mean and sweet at once. She was not loud because there was no need to be. She was herself because there was no one else. In the building opposite, someone lifted a glass, and she lifted her pick in salute and did not hold it too tight. The echo came back a breath later, city to city, room to river, windows to air, the kind of echo that makes you think for a minute that everything is listening and nothing is bored.",

The kitchen window let in a slice of light shaped like a doormat, the kind that makes you feel welcome whether or not you let it trick you. Justice did his circuit of disdain, tail up like a small flag of a hostile nation, then relented and head-butted her shin with a grunt that sounded like a capitulation clause. The coffee maker hiccuped back to life as if it had muttered about abandonment all week and decided to forgive. Outside, someone hosed a sidewalk with the ceremony of a man baptizing his own mistakes, and a woman on the phone argued about cilantro in a tone that suggested war crimes had been committed in her salad.\n\nNikki arrived with the energy of a courier in a plague, mask askew, hair up, a canvas bag full of containers that sweated good intent. She brought soup because it was her covenant with Rayna\u2019s mother and glitter because it was her covenant with her own bad decisions, a zip bag that sparkled like an apology found on the floor of a club. \u201cDrink, eat, and then do not allow the music industry into our house for at least six hours,\u201d she decreed, hip-checking the door closed in a way that made Justice re-evaluate his borders. \u201cAlso, he tried to jump on the stove once, so I taught him \u2018no\u2019 in a tone that would shame a bishop. You\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n\nRayna tasted the chickpea stew that had earned a reputation as the sweater soup and felt her shoulders relax as if oil had been warmed under her skin. Nikki poured coffee with a wrist that had learned grace in spite of itself and leaned against the counter like a woman auditioning for the part of Accomplice. \u201cYou wrote?\u201d she asked without ceremony, and Rayna nodded toward the notebook on the table, pages splayed open, ink dried in the pattern of a decision. \u201cYou\u2019re going to sing it before you let anyone talk about it, right,\u201d Nikki said, not really asking, and Rayna nodded again because there are vows you make with arm hair and not with language.\n\nShiloh tried to breach the six-hour embargo by texting from a meeting he had scheduled with people who had flown in from New York to offer adjectives. They loved her voice, they loved her jawline, they loved her \u201cnarrative elasticity,\u201d which sounded like a term invented by a man who believed in yoga only as a verb inflicted on women. He wanted to set a lunch. He wanted to broker a Zoom. He wanted bullet points and a plan that could survive contact with a Tuesday. Rayna stared at the screen, then typed, in a tone she had borrowed from Maya and kept because it fit, not today. Then she sent a photo of the soup with a caption that said, my agenda is legumes. Shiloh sent back a series of unsmiling face emojis that were meant to be a joke and narrowly avoided becoming a diagnosis.\n\nThe apartment had remembered her guitar the way a dog remembers a leash. She lifted it from its stand and the room\u2019s air changed as if a small animal had padded in. The coin in the watch pocket of her jeans warmed under thumb, becoming again a small sun she could carry around. She played the new thing quiet at first, letting the shape of it contradict the furniture until the furniture agreed to be part of it. The chorus still leapt like a girl who had said dare me at a playground, and the second verse needed to stop apologizing for being smart, but the bridge lay down and turned its throat to her without fear. Nikki watched without pretending she wasn\u2019t and then, when the last note set itself down like a cup on a coaster, she nodded into her own grin. \u201cNot borrowed,\u201d she said, as if she had named a cat and found the cat liked it. \u201cNot bartered. Not boring. It\u2019s you, and you\u2019ve got the teeth out.\u201d\n\nThey did a small domestic liturgy, the kind you invent when you come home from having been someone else for a week. Laundry, but not all of it, because denial is a right. Trash, but only the obvious kind, not the sentimental containers that smell like soup. They found the glitter Nikki had warded the apartment with in corners and refused to curse it because it wrote an argument on the floor that said, you are not safe from joy. Rayna called her mother and left a voice message full of laughter and weather and soup reports because her mother was at work and liked to play proud in public on a delay. She set the peppermint tin by the door like a saint and told herself that was superstition and not architecture.\n\nBy afternoon, the city had returned to its mode of soft interrogation. A friend texted about a backyard barbecue where nobody barbecued because half the guests were vegans and the other half had seen a documentary. A small venue in Echo Park asked if she wanted to \u201ccrash\u201d an open mic that had forgotten it was not a party. The label Shiloh liked texted with a gif of fireworks that managed to look like warning and celebration at once. Nikki put on sunglasses that made her look like a smuggler of tiny diamonds and said, \u201cNew rule: nothing with microphones unless you choose it because your chest asks for it.\u201d Rayna chose the backyard and brought her guitar without promising anybody anything, which is how she preferred to arrive anywhere that had folding chairs.\n\nThere are certain backyards in Los Angeles that have learned how to be churches. This one had string lights that forgave the hour, a table full of dishes coded for every allergy, a dog old enough to have an opinion about music, and a child whose job, apparently, was to pick up fallen limes and put them in a bowl with the concentration of a surgeon. People drifted toward Rayna the way iron filings drift toward a magnet and then, sensing the danger of naming it, drifted away again. She took a beer she didn\u2019t want because the hand offering it had fought with the bottle opener for her, sat on a low wall, and watched the sky bruise itself for the pleasure of a sunset nobody would photograph well.\n\nShe played when she felt like it and not when they asked, slipping into the place where performance is indistinguishable from breathing. The song wasn\u2019t the new one because she didn\u2019t want to give it away under fairy lights that had not signed a nondisclosure agreement with her heart. She sang one from the album that had got her invited to the first bar that didn\u2019t make her stack chairs at the end, and a woman whose name she did not catch cried politely into her own collar. The old dog laid its head on Rayna\u2019s sneaker in a vote of confidence. A man with a wrist tattoo of a teacup asked if she took requests and then shook his head at himself because the request he almost made belonged to a different decade and a girl he had wronged. Rayna was kind to him in silence. When she shifted to leave, somebody slid a square of paper into her guitar case and her stomach said no to it with heat. It wasn\u2019t block caps. It was a scrawl, human, a name and a number and a sentence: my sister wants to learn your song on clarinet, can she. She laughed at herself and the river of adrenaline that still ran under everything, and she texted the next morning with a chart and a note about breath.\n\nThe studio Shiloh booked for the session he swore he wasn\u2019t booking lived in Silver Lake in a building that had once been a bakery and before that had been a place where men cut pieces of other men\u2019s cars into shapes that could be called art. It smelled faintly of yeast if you breathed in a certain corner and of wood if you sat where the drums kept their secrets. The engineer was a woman with a braid thick enough to count as a safety device and a cat that ignored everyone until it didn\u2019t and then owned you. She listened to Rayna\u2019s demo, one hand on the fader like a therapist\u2019s hand on a tissue box, and nodded slow. \u201cIt\u2019s in the mouth,\u201d she said, making space for a fight and not offering one. \u201cDon\u2019t sing it from your shoulders. Sing it from the part of you that lies to border guards.\u201d\n\nThey built it without ceremony, which is how you trick a song into showing you where it wants to sit. Click, then no click. A guitar that felt like sunshine even though the light in the room was the color of tea. Brushes on the snare, then not, then a stick that had been worn down by someone else\u2019s stage. Rayna sang the scratch with her eyes closed because the engineer stopped her before she did the jaw thing. She didn\u2019t think about the watch. She didn\u2019t think about the mint tin. She thought about the breath in the word borrowed and how it sits for a second before it goes where it needs to. The second take had a sweetness that embarrassed her. The third had teeth. They kept the fourth for the line that had the joke in it that wasn\u2019t a joke.\n\nOn the break, they ate tacos from the truck that parked out front with the confidence of a man who knew his salsa was the only argument that mattered. Shiloh arrived with bad coffee and a face full of news he was trying to present as options so she would not feel caged. \u201cThey want it,\u201d he said, laying his hands out flat like a blackjack dealer who was also a priest. \u201cThey want everything; this one worst of all. They want to bundle you. They want to brand you. They want to give you a partner in a duet you\u2019ll loathe by June. We can take their money and run an empire, or we can take less and build something that lets you sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cSleep is not a moral,\u201d Rayna said, chewing thoughtfully. \u201cBut I like waking up. No duet unless my bones ask for it. No bundle. No nickname that would look good on a can of energy drink. I\u2019ll take help but not a leash. If they don\u2019t like that sentence in their mouth, they can spit it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngel,\u201d Shiloh said, pained and proud. \u201cYou make it look like it\u2019s easy to be principled when you\u2019re not hungry anymore. Remind me to feed you before punitive meetings. Also, one of the streaming platforms wants to do a live set in a warehouse designed to look like a different warehouse. Interested?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly if I can make them use real chairs,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m tired of white cubes pretending to be a place to sit.\u201d\n\nThe only time she thought of Andrew Bowman that week was when her mother sent a link to a local news story about a different city, a different man, a different pronoun turned into a plural to sound less lonely. The headline tried to be lurid and came out weary. Rayna didn\u2019t click. She texted back, soup recipe? Her mother sent three, each more confident than the last, each annotated with exasperated notes about grocery clerks who pretended not to know the difference between cumin and whatever it was the store had stocked in its place. The recipes were written in an unpunctuated cascade that made them look like a song if you tilted your head. Rayna printed them out and stuck them to the refrigerator with magnets that said please and thank you in languages she had never learned properly.\n\nBreakfast got claimed by Maya ten days later because competence and planes travel in packs. She was in town to consult on a pilot everyone said wouldn\u2019t get picked up and therefore would. She texted Rayna from a diner that had been set dressed by the ghost of Hopper and asked if the beans here were a safer nation. Rayna walked in at the exact right moment to see her flag down a waitress with two fingers and a glance that could have quashed a rebellion or sweetened a cake. They hugged as if the time zones had been a rumor. Maya smelled like rosemary and printer ink again, and Rayna realized she had missed that combination in a way you cannot admit out loud without inviting trouble.\n\n\u201cYou owe me this,\u201d Maya said, tapping her fork against a plate where eggs had been presented as if the chicken had held a grudge. \u201cYou owe me the moment after, when no one is looking, and you get to say the unpretty thought without someone from wardrobe correcting your posture.\u201d\n\n\u201cI owe you a favor I will pay in any currency you choose except beans,\u201d Rayna said, deflecting out of habit and because the morning had made her soft. \u201cI have unpretty thoughts by the dozen. Here\u2019s one: every time I put on a suit, I win a bar fight I didn\u2019t start, and it makes me want to wear pajamas because I do not want to make my day into a contest.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my unpretty thought,\u201d Maya said, chewing like a sentence she intended to finish. \u201cI\u2019m tired of my work getting called manipulation when the men who do it get called visionaries. I am as manipulative as a seamstress. I sew. The suit looks good because somebody stitched the seams so the cloth wouldn\u2019t lie. You wear the suit like a verb. Keep wearing it. Also, sometimes pajamas win. That\u2019s why they frighten executives more than sequins.\u201d\n\nThey did not talk about missed chances or choices disguised as invitations. They talked about budgets and about British press that had decided to be kind as a health fad. Maya asked after Lianne in a tone that would have sounded casual to anyone who hadn\u2019t seen her rewrite a camera plot with her eyes closed. Rayna showed her the beat-up routine Lianne had taught her, then the calf stretch that made her curse prettily. In return, Maya taught her a thing with a napkin and a sugar packet, a trick for calming a guest who didn\u2019t know their own name on the air\u2014slide the sugar back and forth until the sound becomes a metronome, let your fingers steal rhythm from the tiny thunder. \u201cYou can do it on a pick,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody will see, and you\u2019ll remember to loosen.\u201d\n\nAfter breakfast, Maya walked her past a mural that had gotten its letters right and a Jacaranda that had made a purple mess on a car whose owner would forgive it. At the curb she patted Rayna\u2019s arm lightly, the way one does to check whether a dream has a body. \u201cYou did well,\u201d she said. \u201cNot because you didn\u2019t win. Because you didn\u2019t appetize yourself for the wolves. Come back when you want. I will save you a seat where you can see the river without falling in.\u201d\n\nRayna went home and wrote until the sun tricked her into thinking it was later than it was. The song\u2019s bones had settled; it needed muscle, a bit of fat, a line that would make strangers pull their mouths to the side because they\u2019d found themselves in it and would not confess it. She put the word seamstress in as a nod to Maya, and then took it out because she liked the secret of a last edit. She left in the bit about soups and the bit where borrowed and bartered fought in her throat and the bit where \u201cLeft, love\u201d turned into a direction and an instruction at once. She left in the bridge that said loosen without instructing anyone else how.\n\nOn a Tuesday that felt like a Friday because the sky had decided to be hungover, she played a secret show in a laundromat on Sunset where the owner liked to say artists paid in quarters and then refuse their money when he realized they had walked across the room in their socks. The floor had a sheen of detergent that made the air smell like the childhoods of people who had been loved enough to have clean socks always. People perched on plastic chairs in sober blues and robust oranges, posted without telling their friends because the spell works better if not everyone believes in it yet. Rayna moved her guitar case aside so a woman could get to machine nine. A man with a baby strapped to his chest did the bounce that said, soporific, please. The spin cycles hummed along to the verse and hissed at the vowels, a choir of domesticity.\n\nShe had the suspenders under a shirt she had inherited from someone who told her to keep it til it broke and meant the shirt and not the friendship. She didn\u2019t flash them because the rooms she had come from had taught her that quiet dares are the ones that last. She sang \u201cLoosen,\u201d which wasn\u2019t called that anywhere you could sue, and the room leaned toward her like a plant made of people. The baby slept. The owner clapped so loudly it scared the machines and everyone laughed and then were embarrassed at having laughed at a washer. Afterward, a woman with hair like a halo of bees came up, put both hands on the counter to steady herself against the sentiment coming, and said, \u201cMy husband thinks he knows me because he knows our mortgage. Your song made me want to own something he doesn\u2019t.\u201d Rayna didn\u2019t prescribe divorce or debt. She said, \u201cStart with a secret muscle,\u201d and the woman nodded like someone who had been given a tool she could hide in her purse.\n\nIt would have been tidy for the next week to behave as if arcs were trams and tracks were obligations. Instead it sprawled, lush and stupid, into meetings and sleep and a small fever that was either lack of rest or the city\u2019s pollen trying to kiss her. Shiloh got her fifty percent of everything she swore she hadn\u2019t wanted because he had learned to ask for what she needed after learning he could not make her want what everyone else did. The warehouse show became a small theater with bad seats and great sound because she insisted. The engineer sent the mix and Rayna made herself do the hum test\u2014if a thing still moved her with her own mouth closed, it had earned its place. The hum sat correctly in her chest like furniture she hadn\u2019t realized she had built to suit herself.\n\nRose wrote a letter in ink that had seen worse pens. It arrived with two peppermints taped to it the way light sticks to the tops of waves in patient weather. She had included a photograph of herself on a ship deck with two girls whose thighs looked immortal, all three in dresses that had been engineered for updrafts and learning. On the back she wrote in the understated voice of a person who knows the power of understatements: It is better to be bored than frightened. I prefer to be entertained than either. You were both. Tell your cat I forgive him for being a cat. Rayna laughed, then cried, then held the photo against a glass of sunlight until their dresses shone like a promise no one could hold her to.\n\nAndrew Bowman pled to a list of things that read like an etiquette class for criminals. Trespass. Tampering. Impersonating staff. It did not make a good headline and so it did not get one, and she savored that petty mercy like dessert. There would be others. There are always others. She did not reorganize her life around the ghost of his watch. She did not forgive him to make herself look noble. She did not dedicate songs to the memory of his nerve. She let the cupboard with the new lock live in her head as a place where other people did their jobs and she did hers, which was, it turned out, sometimes the most radical thing people could manage together.\n\nNikki kissed her on the mouth one night like a dare and then pulled back like a person checking a door for heat. It was not a surprise, and it was not inevitable. It felt like a hand over a bruise that had healed into a new color she hadn\u2019t learned the name for. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to name it today,\u201d Nikki said, and sat down on the rug cross-legged and handed Rayna a pick. \u201cWe can pretend we\u2019re in a band and the band rules are a constitution and the constitution says no cruelty, no martyrdom, and honesty that doesn\u2019t get the other person arrested.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want a clause about soup,\u201d Rayna said, and they wrote it in, and then they played a song so bad it made them cackle like teenagers and allowed the night to decide for them when the next kiss would be.\n\nWhen she finally took the song to a room with lights and money, she wore the midnight suit and the suspenders and the coin and the shirt with the history and a pair of shoes she had stitched herself with Nikki\u2019s needle because you do not get to keep the metaphor if you refuse the labor. The room had a low ceiling and a reputation for rumors that came true. The crowd brought a weather system with them, charged and affectionate. She walked to her mark with the same breath she had carried across the bridge in London when the gull had asked about chips as if they were a political party. She looked into the dark the way you look into a lover you trust not to find a better party between now and the middle of the second verse. The first chord landed like a sentence finished and forgiven.\n\nShe did not tighten her hand on the pick. She loosened everything else instead\u2014the jaw, the knee, the small muscle behind her right shoulder that had been taught to brace by men who think volume is authority. She allowed herself the ridiculous luxury of liking herself for the length of a chorus. She believed she would be boring if she tried to be safe. She believed she could be safe without being boring. She believed, briefly and entirely, that the river in London and the dry channel that pretends to be a river here had called a truce over her head, and that she was permitted, for a song, to be the person on the bank who knew them and walked away at the right time.\n\nAfter, outside among the smokers and the lovers and the drinkers who thought hydration was a fad, a young man with a skateboard under his arm told her he had never thought about loosen as anything but failure. He wore a shirt from a gas station he had not been to. His hair had a practical part. He spoke careful, like a man who had remembered to be a boy in a pinch. \u201cMy dad held everything like it was going to run,\u201d he said. \u201cI hold everything like that. My wife tells me I choke. Your song felt like a small insult to that habit. Thank you for insulting me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Rayna said. \u201cTry insult as a hobby. It grows on a person.\u201d\n\nBack on the roof later, the city wore its grapefruit the way a woman wears a dress that someone told her not to, with glee and intent. The air moved though nothing in particular told it to, fresh enough to lie. The neighbor who vacuums at unholy hours folded laundry in a window and did not know anyone was watching. The siren in the distance changed its mind about urgency. Justice hunted a silver moth with a seriousness that should be reserved for international disputes. Rayna leaned her guitar against the low wall and watched the small scurf of glitter in the mayhem of the rug catch light and throw it right back. Somewhere under her skin, the river ran, the good kind, the one made of breath and tendon and the laws of physics when you sing correctly. She put her hand over the watch pocket like a woman pledging an allegiance to a nation unlikely to shoot her. The night did what it does when it believes you will keep your word and keep showing up. It made room. It didn\u2019t get bored. And for once, neither did she.",
