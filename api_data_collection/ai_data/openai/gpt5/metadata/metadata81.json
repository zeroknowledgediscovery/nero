     "novel_text": "The apes came down on a Tuesday, beating shields that rang like pothole covers and clattering through the rust-laced gates as if sound could be a kind of weapon. People ducked, dogs bayed, and someone\u2019s laundry\u2014a string of shirts the same rust-red as the gates\u2014became the first wave\u2019s trophy. Nobody died; nobody ever did during those raids, not in our quarter. There was a method to it, Mara Quill thought as she peered through the split curtains of 49 Ingres Lane and saw the column pass. Every ape chose a shirt, but never two. Every ape paused at the same cracked paving stone and thumped it once with a knuckle as big as her notary stamp. Then they made right angles where alleys offered curves.\n\nShe took notes because she took notes about everything. When nothing was happening, she inventively found meaning in sprinklers and cookie sales and whether the new man in 57 was really a gardener or a soldier, and when something did happen, when armored apes trod laundry and shattered a jar of pickled cabbage in an artful arc like cherry blossoms, she became steady and sweet inside with alertness. She wrote on a recipe card because the notebook she kept for raids had walked off last week; she\u2019d probably lent it to someone who had insisted they would return it. People did say things.\n\n\u201cDear,\u201d she called over her shoulder, because it was a habit and because it comforted her to say it even if no one answered, \u201cplease see how they are touching that same crack. If that isn\u2019t weird, I need new definitions.\u201d\n\nNo one answered. There had been no \u201cdear\u201d for some time now, just the plant in the sink and the constant smell of binder clip metal and ink and an embarrassment of saucers because she kept finding them at yard sales and no one else seemed to want them. They hung like pale moons along the kitchen shelf, and there were too many to use in a lifetime. Her neighbors had opinions about that, as neighbors do.\n\nMara had other tools, too, tucked under the dishcloths: a bone-handled letter opener that might actually have been a knife, a small wooden device for pressing wax seals that she had only once used to press cinnamon into toast, and the thing that had altered her posture, her days, the way she saw her own hands.\n\nShe had called it\u2014because it came with no label and because the man who gave it to her had a cough that ended in \u201ceh, what?\u201d\u2014the infinate stabler, which was what he seemed to call it in the letter, all smudged and mad with pencil.\n\nThere are objects that you pick up and mistake for their cousins; you think a river pebble is a gumdrop. You think a long bone is a walking stick. This was a stapler in the way that a rake is a fork, a since-when tool. It had weight like a word you should not use and a grip that did not grip your palm so much as slide into your hand as if the hand had been made for it, not the other way around. Its jaw could open the span of a loaf pan, but its bite was delicate enough to kiss two curls of paper together and make them whole.\n\nIt made a sound when you used it: not click, not clack, but almost a sigh, like a seam finding itself. It did not run out of staples. Or if it did, the world did not live long enough to see that day. And if it were only a stapler, Mara would have used it to staple everything, which she did anyway: she stapled raffia to the fence when it came loose and stapled a peony\u2019s heavy head to a bamboo stick when the weather made it bow. She stapled a hem, and she stapled a cough, and she was only ashamed about one of those things. She pressed the jaw over her left thumbnail once and it made the smooth press of pressure and there was no pain and afterward, the nail shone like she had polished it with lemon.\n\n\u201cBut what are the apes stapling?\u201d she asked the empty room as the column marched past. The apes\u2019 tusked helmets had ancient scratches in them, stories arranged in parallel lines, and their cloaks looked like stitched pelts of something that had grown in a bramble. They were never dirty. They had ritual dirt, of course; they smeared it on their cheeks the way children touched dabs of paint. Their leader\u2014three leaders?\u2014raised a spear that was more a pointer than a weapon and jabbed it into air on each corner.\n\nHer neighbor, Bram from 73, said a spear is a sentence, and a shield is a book, but he said many things. He used to be a shepherd or so he said, in the hills beyond, where the apes came from if you believed the maps. Mara believed maps like she believed recipes: nice starting points until someone sensible improved them.\n\nShe scribbled: apes touch crack: not random; shirts not socks; no bread stolen; took yard glider last time (why? for what?). Underneath, in smaller letters, she wrote: talk to Bram.\n\nBy the time she got her coat\u2014there had been a cold that hung on like a person without a watch\u2014and stepped out, the apes had passed and the street was less a street and more a commentary on noise. Someone cried about the jar. Somebody else laughed because the jar had contained the worst pickled cabbage in a generation and the apes had done a community service. Mara paused at the cracked stone.\n\nIt was just a crack in a stone. It ran like a river on a map, and when she traced it with her finger, she felt a coolness, as if wind had been pressed there. She tried to lift the stone. The stone stayed. She took the infinate stabler from her coat pocket because this was that kind of day and because curiosity is a kind of oath and because she knew people were watching and she liked that a little more than she let on, and pressed the open jaw over the crack.\n\n\u201cJust to see,\u201d she said.\n\nThe stabler made its sigh, and the crack became a line. The line became nothing. The stone was whole, unbroken, as if freshly poured, as if someone had turned back the day before the day it cracked.\n\nA boy whistled. Bram, who had been in the doorway of 73 working a cigarette he never lit, stepped off his stoop as if he\u2019d been waiting for her. He had hair like a broom that had been used, then washed, then used again, and the narrow look of a person who spent time noticing shadows so he could step in or out of them at the right moment.\n\n\u201cI told you not to do that in public,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou told me to tie down the world if it flapped,\u201d Mara said, not lifting the stabler, keeping it in her hand because otherwise it seemed to disappear where she put it, which was a thing that freaked her out and did not freak her out, both.\n\n\u201cI said nothing like that,\u201d Bram said, \u201cbut let\u2019s pretend I did and that I am clever for it. That crack\u2014how long do you think it was there?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the quake,\u201d she said, and when he made a face she added, \u201cor since before the quake. There\u2019s always a before.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome cracks you want. They tell you where not to step. Some news is kind in that way,\u201d he said, but his eyes were on the street, on the same path the apes had taken, on the spots where they\u2019d paused. He stepped to the nearest stoop and knocked with his knuckles; the old woman who lived there shook her head, already knowing, and pushed out a broom so he could sweep the spilled cabbage into a polite hill.\n\n\u201cAre you thrumming?\u201d Mara asked, which was code for Are you listening to something invisible?\n\n\u201cMm,\u201d Bram said. His ear had a sore spot where it pinched in and held onto the world. He crouched and touched the stone that had been cracked and pressed his palm flat to it. \u201cYou patched it. They\u2019ll either be disappointed or impressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey who?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem,\u201d Bram said, and then laughed at himself because he hated how he sounded when he said things like that. \u201cYou know. The apes. I don\u2019t think they like broken things. It throws them. They march on top of seams because they like to know where the seams are. See? It\u2019s a flock thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cA what thing,\u201d Mara said, even though she had heard him say that word before and had chosen to pretend he hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Bram said, and pinched the bridge of his nose as if the world had spilled too bright. He looked at her hand, at the weight of metal resting like a threat or a blessing in her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get asked to do something with that. If not today, then tomorrow. I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t say yes without telling me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say yes to anything,\u201d Mara said, and then caught herself, because she had said yes to everything that ever knocked on her door.\n\nLater, after the street had returned to its usual business of being watched and being repaired and being watched being repaired, she went to Bram\u2019s because he brewed coffee in a pot you had to coax over the stove and it tasted like something dangerous and old. His room smelled like wet wool that had been allowed to sing, which made no sense when she told anybody else, so she didn\u2019t, not anymore. He had a rack of walking sticks that had the same notch carved into each, and photographs where the sky looked heavier than any sky she had seen.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come again in three days,\u201d he said, laying out cups, and because Mara watched him like she watched everything, she noticed he always set an extra cup down and then thought better of it and put it back, like the person he hoped would come never did. \u201cAnd not here. They\u2019ll go to the ring market, to the clay arcades.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the spice sellers put their tables and the locksmith with the pretty son has the cart for his brass shapes,\u201d Mara said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have them taking keys. Everyone\u2019d be locked out. The locksmith would be drunk on business and then ashamed of being so happy about why.\u201d\n\nBram grunted. \u201cThey won\u2019t take keys. They don\u2019t like pockets. Keys go in pockets, and they are not, by nature, pocket people.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d Mara said, to see if he would argue with it.\n\nBram took his time. He carried the pot to the table and poured.\n\n\u201cYou know the trouble with obvious truths?\u201d he asked, settling. \u201cThey settle in you so deep you can\u2019t spit them out. Every child in this city can draw you an ape: the brow, the fists, the way they bend from the waist when they run. They can tell you how to scare one with a bell or a cunning cat. They can tell you how the first Legions came across the iron seam that runs from quarry to sea, and how they learned to stack their shields into steps. And they will have never in their lives watched one eat.\u201d\n\nMara stirred her coffee, which needed no stirring; it didn\u2019t need milk, either, but she liked the swirl.\n\n\u201cAre you about to talk about grass?\u201d she asked.\n\nBram\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cI am about to talk about mouths. About teeth. Did you see the leader\u2019s smile today? Did you see the shape of his pupils?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see me looking directly into the mouth of the leader of the apes? I prefer to keep the parts of me that are arranged as they are arranged,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, Bram. Why don\u2019t you tell me about pupils.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t round,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were\u2014then again, I forget where you grew up. Maybe you didn\u2019t have the hills. Maybe you never went out when the fog lifts and the ewes are calling their lambs in the gullies and the sky is eating the last of the night. Maybe you never looked an animal in the eye and learned what it was by the shape of the light it let in. Rectangles. Did you know? Like doors.\u201d\n\nHe looked, for a second, like the boy he had once been. It came like light off a puddle, quickly gone. \u201cAnyway. Keys are useless to them. Locks are already open. They don\u2019t come for things. They come for corners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we supposed to do,\u201d Mara asked, \u201cif they take the corners? Our houses will roll away. All the tables will be round.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t smile as much as he surrendered to the idea of smiling, and then the smile left him like a rumor leaves a room.\n\n\u201cAre you going to ask me why I have so many sticks?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, which made him lift his eyebrows.\n\nShe had asked him two dozen times already; this was their game. And he had never answered in a straight line. Today, he said, \u201cYou carry a tool like a flag. You can either wave it or you can pretend it is a weather vane and hope the wind is patient with your pretense. People will come to you, Mara. People who say words like duty and humanity and curtain. People who whisper in their shirts. People who are sure. It\u2019s a kind of hunger, certainty is. You should eat before they knock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already did,\u201d she said, and then because he was right and because the infinate stabler had a way of making a day feel like a thing with edges, she ate again.\n\nThe knock came before the third day, because of course it did. You put a peculiar thing near a window and the city smells it. She had been rearranging the saucers into a pattern she was sure meant something\u2014moon, moon, sea, egg, egg\u2014and she left them half-made on the table and went to the door with the stabler in her pocket and her hair like she had been living.\n\nThe man on the stoop wore a uniform that was the opposite of the apes\u2019: it made his edges softer. He had his papers in order and a smile like a physician or a salesman.\n\n\u201cMs. Quill,\u201d he said, \u201cMara, may I be \u2018Mara\u2019? It\u2019s so much friendlier. I\u2019m Corwin with the Council. You have something the city would like to borrow. Temporarily. For the good of\u2014oh. Is that coffee?\u201d\n\nShe did not move aside. \u201cI\u2019ll put the kettle on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do love a kettle,\u201d he said, stepping in because people like him are made to step in. \u201cMy mother kept the kettle singing like a bird and the house was never\u2014well. Do you mind if I set this folder here.\u201d\n\nHe had the folder. Of course he had the folder. Inside were her notes, the careless ones, the ones she\u2019d given to Laleh at the paper because Laleh had a laugh like a trap door and Mara liked to feed it. There were pictures of her fence with the raffia neatly stapled, and of the light in her left window like she forgot sometimes to turn it off. Her life rendered in reasonable arguments why she should cooperate.\n\n\u201cYou have something,\u201d he said again when the kettle had not boiled because he had lost track of his time and had forgotten who boiled what. \u201cIt\u2019d be a kindness. Only for a few hours. The ring market\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days,\u201d Mara said.\n\n\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll go to the ring market in three days. That\u2019s where you want my help. Bram says keys are safe. Corners aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorners,\u201d Corwin said, as if it were a code and as if he was translating it in his mouth. \u201cWe had a mathematician say something like that. She drew a square on the chalkboard and then erased all of it except one angle, and we all stood there like crows look at mirrors. We\u2019ve been recommending circles where possible, but people like corners. We\u2019re trying to change the fashion.\u201d\n\nMara poured coffee and watched him be good at drinking it. He was a man who could pretend anything was pleasant, and sometimes that is more dangerous than delirium.\n\n\u201cWhat does the Council want me to do,\u201d she asked, although her hand had already gone to the stabler in her pocket and found it too warm, like a small sleeping thing.\n\n\u201cYou have a tool that might bind one thing to another. Strongly. Efficiently. If we can keep them from opening our corners, we can keep their columns outside. For a time. I know time is a small piece of bread and everyone wants a bite, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m offering you. A bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are they after. Besides corners.\u201d\n\nCorwin touched the folder and said nothing for an elegant length of time. \u201cStability,\u201d he said finally, which was not the same as saying corners. \u201cYou see, and please don\u2019t repeat this to the man with the sticks, because he is allergic to words like mine, we suspect the raids are rehearsals. Not for war. For settlement. They don\u2019t burn. They don\u2019t\u2014pardon\u2014rape. They make measurements. They leave a thin wool on our lintels, sometimes, have you noticed, and our dogs sneeze for an hour. Our bakers say the bread comes out heavier the day after they pass. Our barbers say everybody comes in and wants their hair shorter like they are preparing to wear helmets. It\u2019s a kind of survey. We think, if they think these houses are already theirs in some future we can almost see, they\u2019ll be less likely to break them now. To keep the place tidy for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Council,\u201d Mara said, \u201cwould prefer they feel the opposite.\u201d\n\nCorwin smiled, and the smile took all the easy out of his face. \u201cI would prefer you to act as if you also live here. I hear you\u2019re a very good neighbor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been asking my neighbors about me,\u201d she said, flat.\n\nHe folded his hands. \u201cBram says you are a busybody. This is not a bad word where I come from. My mother kept a list of births and deaths on the door and would go knock an hour after the knockers left with pies and envelopes and the names of good plumbers. We call that civic, where I come from. You have the tool, Ms. Quill. I\u2019m here to make sure you get to use it for what it\u2019s for.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to ask: for what is it for? But the stabler thrummed in her pocket as if it could hear and as if it did not like being referred to in the general, like a woman being told she was a category. \u201cThree days,\u201d she said again, because it made the word feel round and she needed something round to hold.\n\nThey met where the clay arcades met the ring road. There were pots stacked in crescents and cinnamon knotted into sticks and a wind pulled long over the ground so the canvas tents flapped and the school kids ducked and came back up as if the day had winked. Mara wore a jacket with too many pockets. Bram carried a stick today, though he always had a stick; this one had a strip of cloth tied near the head, and if you squinted the cloth might have been a flag. Corwin had a pen in his shirt like a promise. The locksmith\u2019s pretty son had his sleeves rolled up and grease on his knuckles and he winked for no reason at all except that he was young and the day seemed like a thing that could be placed in a pocket and brought out later, still warm.\n\nThe apes came as Corwin said they would not: they had no plan to be late and were. People hate their predictions to be wrong when they are official about it. Mara watched him swallow the error and make a different one with his second mouth. She felt the crowd collect around edges they couldn\u2019t help making\u2014corners at tent meets, corners at the base of a pillar where someone had left a broom, corners where two faces came together with a laugh and a hand tugged another hand into a shadow.\n\nThey came with their shields and their drums and the sound of bellows in a forge that someone had put under the earth. They came with tasseled blades that never cut and the self-same solemnity they wore in the laundries. They came. And then they stalled.\n\nThey stalled because Mara stepped forward, which was not the plan because there had never been a plan and she had told herself there should be one and then told herself the telling was a plan and had, in a small way, believed it. She put the infinate stabler like a carpenters\u2019 truth out in front of her and opened the jaw and explained, with no words, that if anyone opened something today that shouldn\u2019t be opened, they would close it. She felt the click no one else heard. She felt the crowd back up into a softer shape behind her, as if the street had become a set of lungs and someone had told it a joke.\n\nThe leader\u2014leaders\u2014came forward. Today there were two, or one and a mirror. The left one touched the ground with his spear and tapped out a pattern: tap, tap, nothing, tap. The right one hummed.\n\nMara said, \u201cI\u2019m Mara Quill,\u201d which was not particularly useful, and then because she spoke fluent human she added, \u201cIf you touch our corners I will staple them back on.\u201d\n\nThe left leader\u2019s shoulders moved. It might have been laughter. It might have been breath. The right leader looked at her hand, not at her face, and then leaned his body\u2014there were a lot of bodies. It\u2019s easy to say \u201can ape\u201d and imagine one thing. It\u2019s better to say: a shoulder with a scar shaped like a piece of a moon, two knees that had grazed stone for reasons unknown, a wrist wrapped in red thread, a mouth that did not sit right because a tooth had grown in late and sideways. He leaned, and Mara saw it. It was quick, like a bird. A flick of tongue? No. A catch of light on a ring in the nose? Also no. It was his eye, and no one saw it, not even Bram who sees too much because he looked at something else right then (the hand of a child, maybe, because always he could find the child\u2019s hand in the crowd)\u2014and Mara saw the slit of the pupil and it was not a slit at all. It was a door. A rectangle that widened as the world brightened, a field\u2019s view, a gate.\n\nShe laughed, not kindly. She couldn\u2019t help it. It came out like a bark.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been eating grass,\u201d she said, and Corwin hissed and Bram said her name and the leaders heard something in her voice that we didn\u2019t. They shifted. The one with the scar put his hand on his chest the way a man swears a thing. He did not speak words, or not in the way we make them. He bleated.\n\nNo one laughed but her and a baby and a dog.\n\nHere is where stories fork. You tell the one where the village roars and the apes roar back and then there is a great rectifiable confusion. Or you tell the one where the woman with the odd tool blows it like a whistle and they all stop and take tea. Or you tell the one no one believes, where two truths show up at the same party in the same dress and you realize how little you know about the shape of a mouth or the meaning of a noise.\n\nBram stepped forward with his stick and put it down and then picked it up again, and that was some shepherd\u2019s signal from an old, old country where the hills made their own weather and the sheep made their own bargains. The leaders turned their heads in the same way, like a flock does when a dog pivots, the same enclosed elegance. Their shoulders moved again. The right one bleated back, to test what language could do between humans and not-humans and something worse. The crowd\u2019s patience stretched like warm candy. Corwin said \u201cNow, now\u2014,\u201d and sound had never sounded less like meaning.\n\nMara lifted the stabler. \u201cYou think we don\u2019t see you,\u201d she said. She was shaking and she would not admit it even later. \u201cFine. Maybe we see you too much. Maybe we\u2019ve been drawing the wrong pictures for the right myths. You like corners because corners keep the wind off. You like corners because corners keep you from being seen from all sides. You like corners because we live in them, because we are the sort of beasts that find a corner and claim it. But you\u2019re not apes. You\u2019re not, are you. Show me.\u201d\n\nShe closed the jaw gently around the rim of the world and pressed. It was a trick she had learned with the peonies, when she\u2019d been brave with flowers. You can bite a stem and hold up a drowned blossom and make it look like it is proud. You can press a hem and it won\u2019t fray. You can, if you are patient, staple a lie to a lie and make a whole cloth.\n\nThe stabler sighed. The canvas tents stopped flapping though the wind still was. The dust froze mid-billow. The leader\u2019s helmet did not fall because gravity did not need that kind of service from her; it tilted and the strap popped and there was wool where a throat should have been, thick and clean and smelling of lanolin and rain. It bristled. It had burrs, small ones, as if someone had walked through a story that had grown in a hedgerow.\n\nThere was no blood. There was no reveal like a melodrama. There was the thing that happens when your eyes decide they will stop lying to you right now, and all the tricks you taught to your mind\u2014don\u2019t look, don\u2019t see, don\u2019t think\u2014get tired and sit down.\n\nThe crowd did not scream because it had never been taught how to make that sound. The apes\u2014sheep, not apes\u2014bleated, but it was not fear and it was not joy; it was a checking-in, like the sound people make at a table when a stranger sits down and takes off their hat and is not a stranger. The leader\u2014the leaders\u2014reached up and took the helmet entirely away.\n\n\u201cGood heavens,\u201d Corwin said, and then covered his mouth because good heavens was a very funny thing to say at such a moment and he did not intend to be someone\u2019s joke.\n\nBram\u2019s stick drooped and then lifted. He looked not surprised, which told Mara he knew and also that he had not wanted to know in the way that counts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been walking them like men,\u201d she said to him, not exactly kindly and not exactly unkind.\n\n\u201cWe all have,\u201d he said and did not make a poem of it.\n\nThe leader put a hoof on the spear, which was very much a stick now that you looked at it. The hoof was cloven. The straps that had held armor to wool looked like someone had practiced a lot of knots. Mara wanted to tidy them and did not. The leader\u2019s eye\u2014that gate\u2014looked at her, and she looked back, and the stabler was heavy in her hand, as if it had eaten something rich.\n\nHe bleated. He bleated again, and the second time it was almost words, not hers, not Bram\u2019s, not any that Laleh could print and feel right about, but something like obligation. It reminded her of the way Corwin had said duty, like it was a cake he liked but knew he should not have every day.\n\n\u201cAre you trying to tell me you came to save us,\u201d Mara asked, and her voice wanted to be a whisper but it refused. \u201cBecause I am going to be a very difficult person about that.\u201d\n\nThe leader looked down at the crack in the stone that wasn\u2019t there anymore because she had fixed it with her foolishness and then back up at her. He bleated a little differently. He lowered his head, not to butt, but to show the crown of it, the way a sheep will when it acknowledges a dog, when it negotiates in that old mathematics.\n\nBram coughed his laugh. \u201cThey came to measure us. Herds measure, you know. That\u2019s what they do. It\u2019s not as martial as you love, Corwin. It\u2019s not a war at all; that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been so bad at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad,\u201d Mara said softly, not because she thought the sheep couldn\u2019t hear and not because she thought it\u2019d be gentle. \u201cBad at war and good at\u2014what? Counting? Caring?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeeping,\u201d Bram said, and then shook his head because he spoke too much when the air got thin. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to know if we\u2019re going to wander. They\u2019ll want fences without saying fences. They\u2019ll want\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStability,\u201d Corwin said, as if he\u2019d gotten it right after all, and maybe he had, and maybe his mother\u2019s kettle had been singing this whole time and he had never heard the tune. \u201cThey want us in a pen. The city as a pen. The way that makes it sound worse than it is.\u201d\n\nMara held the infinate stabler and looked at the sheep in armor and at the people pressed into shapes behind her and at Bram\u2019s stick and Corwin\u2019s pen and the locksmith\u2019s pretty son scrubbing his knuckles like he could polish the day away to reveal something brighter. She did not speak for nine heartbeats. That\u2019s a long time in a ring market when everyone has things to sell and everyone has things to buy and a rumor has a travel plan. It was long enough for her to find the edges of a thought and press them together and feel the sigh of a seam finding itself.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, to the leaders who were not men and to the people who were and to herself, who had been both at times. \u201cIf you came to keep us, you have to do it by our terms. You have to let us keep the parts of us that leave. In return I\u2019ll make you a bargain. You stop touching our corners, and I keep the ones we have. Not for you. For us. But you can\u2014\u201d she looked at Bram because sometimes you need someone to tell you if you\u2019re talking sense or carving nonsense into the table with your knife\u2014\u201cyou can\u2026 watch. From the hill. And you can tell us when the sky is wrong. And when wolves come, which they always do, you come, but you don\u2019t take the lambs; you take the wolf. Do you see? Do you even see me.\u201d\n\nShe did not know if the leader saw her. He bleated. He nodded. It looked like a nod. His wool shook because the wind remembered it existed and returned to do its work, and the canvas struck its ropes with the old interest of a drum seeking a song. Someone began to cry. Someone began to laugh. People do both when the world goes sideways and then insists that it was never upright in the first place.\n\nCorwin exhaled. \u201cYou can\u2019t make treaties,\u201d he said, not unkind. \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t, you personally. I can\u2019t explain the law. It requires \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cRequire me later,\u201d Mara said. \u201cToday I\u2019m stapling.\u201d She turned and put the infinate stabler, carefully, deliberately, on one of the market\u2019s corners: post to rug, rug to road. The sigh when the jaw closed went through the crowd like a kiss pressed to a forehead. She moved to another corner and pressed again. People watched. They began to bring her corners. They offered the mistakes they had made with their tents and with their thresholds and with their lives. Men who had been angry an hour ago became helpful. A girl who had been bored became a champion of edges. When she stapled a fence in a way it had always wanted to be, the sheep leader bleated and another sheep bleated and the sound was not war and it was not an ending. It was maybe a beginning; she would not say it, but she felt the way the ground approved.\n\nIt is very hard to defend a city with a tool borrowed from an office. It is very hard to be the kind of person who knocks on everybody\u2019s door and tells them their potted plant needs turning and then to be someone who lifts a device and says, I\u2019m going to hold you together now, whether you agree or not, because the wind is playing tricks. It is hard, and Mara was not particularly good at it, not at first. But she was stubborn, and she catalogued, and she learned that a corner is the memory of a turn, which is why it hurts to see one battered. She learned where to press and where to hold off. She learned that some seams should be left open because a city needs to breathe like a boy.\n\nBy late, the apes-who-were-sheep had taken their helmets back and the dog that had laughed lay down in a stripe of light and fell asleep. Bram leaned his stick in the crook of his arm and said, \u201cYou know this isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is over,\u201d Mara said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her the way he looked sometimes, like he had known her far too long and not long enough. \u201cI should have told you earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have told you when you showed me that thing and it bit your thumb that day and you swore. I should have said: they\u2019re sheep. You\u2019d have laughed before the right time and then, today, you\u2019d have cried before the wrong. But I thought if I didn\u2019t say it out loud, it might not be true in the way that matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there a way that matters?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe did not answer. Corwin did.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we write it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not writing this one down,\u201d Mara said, and there was enough tired in her voice to lay bricks.\n\nCorwin smiled his second smile. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody says, the first time.\u201d\n\nShe walked home with the infinate stabler long against her forearm like a sleeping cat. The street had changed. It had more corners than it had had that morning. Some were small, the kind you could tuck a secret in. Some were new and bright and looked like they would hurt if you ran into them too fast. She saw where she had missed a place and where someone had seen and patched it with string and hope. She saw Bram on his stoop and felt the ache of future nights when he wouldn\u2019t be there and how the sticks would lean in the empty hallway as if they knew something about weather and absence. The sky had a wrong in it she could not name; it looked too close to the roofs or maybe the roofs had grown taller when nobody was watching.\n\nWhen she went in, the saucers were still on the table in their almost-pattern, and she let them stay like that because they had their own opinion about arrangement. She put the stabler in the sink because it was the only place in her house that anything heavy sat and looked at all right and because it was where you put things you did not yet have words for. It made a sound when the porcelain kissed metal. It sounded like yes and like stop and like the last thing somebody says before the important thing they cannot say.\n\nShe did not sleep. She tried. The city turned in its bed. She listened to Bram\u2019s cough and to the dogs and to the late step of a boy and to the quiet between three and four that belonged to no particular breed of creature. She thought about eyes like doors. She thought about the way the leader had dipped his head. She thought about Corwin, who was a man made of folders, and about Laleh, who had two pens in her hair and always wrote her name across a page before she wrote anything else on it, as if staking it. She thought about all the corners she had tightened today and the ones that would spring when the day warmed, because that was the way of things, that they tried to become themselves when you held them, and some of them succeeded.\n\nWhen morning took its breath, she got up and went to the market before anyone else. She walked the perimeter. The sheep had left a strand of wool on one of the posts, and she lifted it and twisted it the way she had once twisted a curl when a girl and liked herself. It smelled like weather. She put it in her pocket.\n\nAt the cracked stone she had fixed\u2014which was not cracked anymore because she had made it not crack but which remembered itself anyway when you stepped just right\u2014she paused, as the apes had done, and thumped it with her knuckle. It made the noise a pot makes when it expects soup soon. She decided she would make soup.\n\nOn the second day after she had pulled a helmet off a sheep and said aloud something no one wanted to put their mouths around, Corwin came back, and Laleh came to make the story behave, and Bram did not come because he was watching a sky on a hill and listening to a gap in the wind you only heard if you\u2019d been taught by lambs. The Council would want to enlist her. People would bring her things to fix, beyond corners, to make them stay or not\u2014wounds, promises, a marriage, a road. There were wolves, after all. There are always wolves. And there were sheep who were not what they wore, and people who had never been anything other than what they claimed, and a tool in a sink that could fasten a day to a day and make it hold.\n\nShe did not want to be the kind of person who walked into rooms and made lines with her hands. She had wanted small things: to have a cup ready when someone came in, to know when the rain would stall, to know who in the building was happy and who was not. She had wanted, at most, to be the woman with saucers who knows where all the saucers in a building are. And yet the world had called on her to staple it, to keep it together, to hold on. Someone had to. The city was too proud to ask, but it had asked anyway when it let the apes enter and didn\u2019t bar the gates with anything but custom and convenience.\n\n\u201cIt was always you,\u201d Bram had told her once, when he\u2019d had just enough to drink to allow himself an unlovely truth. He had said it like he was telling her where her lost glove had gone. She had pretended not to hear. She heard now, in the wake of bleats and sighs and helmet straps. It tasted like pennies. It tasted better as it sat.\n\nWhen Laleh came she looked at the stabler and made her face neutral and wrote down the thing without writing it down at all. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cthe apes are sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt turns,\u201d Mara said, \u201cthat everything is a sentence you are still reading, and this is the clause where we turn the page.\u201d She hated herself a little for the drama. Laleh wrote it down anyway and added an exclamation point in her head and then crossed it out in the same head because she was disciplined.\n\nCorwin brought the folder. He put it on the table like a gift he was uncertain was appropriate. \u201cI need you to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we say it, once we write it, it\u2019s true in the way that matters. People will make habits out of it. They\u2019ll bring them flower crowns. They\u2019ll break their shields for combs. They\u2019ll forget the part where wolves have teeth. They\u2019ll forget the part where sheep have teeth, too.\u201d\n\nMara picked up the wool from her pocket and pulled it to a longer thread until it snapped. She felt the energy in the break. She thought of the way the stabler sighed. She thought of how the leaders\u2019 pupils had opened like doors and the way the city had not decided yet whether to be flattered or afraid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to protect us from a truth,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI might try to staple it down so it doesn\u2019t blow away.\u201d\n\nCorwin sat. Laleh stood. Somewhere, Bram whistled and a line of creatures changed direction.\n\nMara placed the strand of wool on the table and made two ends meet. She lifted the infinate stabler and pressed its jaw open and set it around the meeting place with a familiar care. She hesitated and then she pressed.\n\nThe sigh made the saucers hum. The seam held. The air steadied. The day decided to be a day again. And in the hills, in a place where no one had told anyone what to call it, a flock lifted its heads and then went on chewing.By afternoon the newspaper had found a way to say what it could not say without looking foolish, which is the great work of newspapers. Laleh\u2019s headline did not announce anything so much as blink at the reader and dare them to finish the sentence for themselves: Helmets and Wool: What We Learned at the Ring last Marketday. The picture showed a line of shields and a canvas tent behaving and the corner of a hoof as if a horse had wandered into frame, which of course none had. The piece named no names but everybody wrote the names in anyway: that\u2019s Mara Quill, that\u2019s Bram with one of his batons, that\u2019s Corwin frowning like he is trying not to frown. Neighbors stopped in the bakery to pinch the paper between fingers still sugar-dusted and permit themselves opinions that had been waiting all their lives for a subject. \u201cThey were always sheep,\u201d one said with authority not available until this instant, and, \u201cNonsense, I have seen an ape\u2019s hand in my dreams,\u201d said another, and between those two statements the city made itself busy the way people arrange chairs at a kitchen table to make a hard conversation friendlier, and just as likely to curdle into something louder.\n\nMara had not intended to read it, but of course she did, re-folding the page after as if nothing had been unfolded, like an apology made to a napkin. She stood at the sink and let the sink run and then remembered she had a gift for missing what was right in front of her. The infinate stabler sat at the bottom of the basin like a fish that had decided to be still in a shallow pool. The water threaded itself around it and did not rise. It should have. It did not. The tap ran sound and air, a thin hiss that made her teeth think of wool. She shut it off and touched the stabler with two fingers as if feeling for a pulse on a throat. It was warm without being hot and dry without being dry in the normal way; it was the dryness of a page that has been licked by a person who thinks this will make the pen behave better.\n\nPeople began coming without asking permission, which meant they knocked first and then knocked again while their faces were already inside, a choreography she had trained herself to enjoy and secretly despise. A woman from the fifth floor with the baby that had laughed at the market came with a basket that contained no baby, only bills and envelopes and a braid of garlic as if vampires had been invited and were late. \u201cCan you fasten this,\u201d she asked, and Mara knew she did not mean the garlic, which had its own talent for binding scents to days. \u201cHe says he\u2019ll stop spending on marmalade we don\u2019t like. He says it\u2019s a small thing and that\u2019s the smallness of it that makes it sweet. He says a lot of things. Could you make one of them true.\u201d\n\nMara motioned to the table, to the pattern of saucers she had finally surrendered to, and the woman sat and put the basket down as if fiction were being made. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d Mara said. \u201cIt barely works at all. It works on seams that already know they are seams. It doesn\u2019t make a seam where no seam belongs. It does not\u2014\u201d she looked at the garlic, which had its own opinions\u2014\u201cit does not trick husbands into sense.\u201d\n\nThe woman made a noise like she knew that and had hoped to forget it long enough to have someone else tell her. She left the bills and the garlic anyway because being seen leaving something behind in Mara\u2019s kitchen was a kind of act that could be referred to later and comfort the right set of nerves at three in the morning. After, a boy came with a kite that needed to be more sky than string and a teacher came with a stack of essays that needed to be more argument than display and a man came with a watch that had lost its afternoons. Mara did what she could for the kite and told the teacher that she could only staple ideas if the girls writing them wanted to be held to their words\u2014not all of them did, some were practicing how to slip\u2014and for the man she had nothing but a cup of coffee and two kinds of silence. She felt wicked saying no. The city had appointed her\u2014it had not; it had only glanced at her with the particular light that means now, now\u2014and she had said yes to everything that could be made into a list. She reminded herself that staples are not prayers. They are just a way of asking two edges to be courteous.\n\nCorwin arrived with his suit like a weather system, bringing the smell of ink and shoe polish and that sweet blue thread all paperwork carries even when the papers are blank. He put the folder on her table and took his time because men like him live longer in the space they occupy when they are inconveniencing someone they imagine they can persuade. He did not look at the saucers. He had trained himself not to look at a person\u2019s small peculiarities the way you train a dog not to stare at the meat you are saving for later. \u201cWe opened a conversation,\u201d he said, making \u201cwe\u201d do the work of \u201cI did not get shouted at for this and would like to continue not getting shouted at,\u201d and Mara poured water for him and made a face for him to ignore.\n\n\u201cThere are wolves,\u201d he said, only after biscuits and the kind of talk that passes for immediate between people who pretended yesterday did not happen. \u201cBram is gone; he left me a note that smelled like grass and told me he would be where grass listens. The shepherds\u2014they have shepherds in the hills, did you know, not just men like Bram who stand alone with their sticks in a city street and scare children into better posture\u2014they sent word that path-wolves have been seen on the iron seam.\u201d\n\nMara didn\u2019t know about path-wolves because no one had told her, which was astonishing because she was certain she had been told everything worth knowing since the day she learned to go down stairs with her cup and not spill a drop. \u201cPath-wolves,\u201d she said, tasting it. \u201cLike wolves, but with paths,\u201d she said, because her brain did better when it could goad her mouth into helping, and Corwin made a rectangle in the air with his fingers and tapped the corners, an unconscious little prayer he did now without knowing it.\n\n\u201cLike wolves who do not need mouths,\u201d he said. \u201cLike wolves that choose the easy way down a hill and then choose it again and then make the earth decide for itself that this is the way always, and then everything that walks must walk in that groove or risk falling. They dig with time, Mara. They make paths that are ruts and then roads and then habits. We had them once, anyone with a grandmother will tell you. They took the alley behind a house until the alley was the only way to the house, and then the house was the alley. We paved them out, or we thought we did, but the quarries have been busy, and the seam is exposed, and the wolves have teeth like repetition.\u201d\n\nShe thought of the apes-that-weren\u2019t, their rectangular eyes, their love of corners not for owning but for managing, for taking attendance. She thought of Bram with a stick on a hill whistling at a sky. She thought of her tool, which did not make wolves or cure them, but might stop a corner from forgetting itself in the face of a groove\u2019s nagging. \u201cYou want me to\u2014what. Staple roads to their place,\u201d she said. \u201cStaple habits to a set of manners. Staple path to path so it cannot widen into a will.\u201d\n\nHe gestured with his pen and almost laughed. \u201cI want you to come see. At least come see. You and Bram love to see. You can leave the tool at home if you think it will sulk in company.\u201d\n\nThe seam ran raw as a vein from the quarry all the way down to where the sea ate any promise you gave it out of courtesy. It sparkled where the sun found it, a glitter that made children point and then stop pointing because you tell your hands not to be rude in public and sometimes they listen. The first time she walked along it as a girl\u2014there had been a picnic, and a different man called dear then, and her saucers had an actual service to be part of\u2014she slid one foot along the iron to feel the world hum and was scolded into hand-holding and caution. Now, with Corwin and his pen and a woman from Public Safety who had the posture of someone who had slept in her clothes and liked it, Mara stood and saw how the path-wolves had begun their work. You cannot see a wolf until it has decided to show itself, but you can see where it is going to be later. There were lines in the dirt where there should have been scatter. There were lines in the grass where there should have been scuffle. The seam had a run, like a stocking. It was beautiful if you decided having your choices narrowed was beautiful.\n\nBram stood a little way up and lifted his stick, not as greeting but as proof that he had brought to the hill the one thing on earth that confessed honestly to being a tool. He was not alone. The shepherds were nothing like their stories; the stories made them humble and taciturn and dusty and carrying lambs over their shoulders without complaint. The people on the hill were chatty and well-shod and had knives for cutting bread that had never seen a sheep\u2019s wool in their lives. They had dogs whose eyes were triangles of intent and whose bodies were made entirely of the knowledge that they were right when they moved left. They kept their hats tight, because wind. They had wrists wrapped in red threads and scars in parallel lines that made Mara\u2019s hands feel like paper.\n\n\u201cPath-wolves,\u201d one said, not to Corwin but to the woman from Public Safety because he had recognized her as a person who knew how to have a plan and had perhaps never met one of those in the hills. \u201cThey like a seam. They like it because it is already a decision. All they have to do is make the decision tire itself out so we accept it. You get one cart wheel after another and before you can say, who tied this knot, you have a groove that knows your grandmother\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could pave,\u201d the woman said, staring, because it is the first response of an urban mind when a wild thing begins to make art.\n\n\u201cWe could pave,\u201d Bram said, from his place, \u201cand that would be a path-wolf\u2019s favorite. Paving is a kind of worship for them. It is the final confession. \u2018We will always be this way here,\u2019 the street says. Then it can sit and wait for hooves.\u201d\n\nMara crouched and pressed her fingers along the iron seam, finding where the earth gave and where it resisted with personality. The stabler in her bag shifted, an animal waking. She had promised herself she would leave it home and had not fulfilled that promise; people do that when they are very sure of themselves. \u201cWe could stitch,\u201d she said without meaning to speak out loud. Bram heard her across too much air because that\u2019s what being alive with a person looks like, sometimes; they hear your mouth before your mouth hears it. He glanced down.\n\n\u201cYou could stitch,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could make the corner a place that resists forgetting. You could make it say \u2018I am a turn\u2019 and not \u2018I am an invitation to a straight line.\u2019 Does your tool like that.\u201d\n\nMara put the bag down and took the thing out and held it in a way that made the shepherds stop looking at her face and start looking at the mouth of metal the way you look at a dog\u2019s mouth, calculating for kindness. There are ways to show strangers that you mean well without teaching them your whole biography. She pressed her hand along the jaw the way she had pressed it along the iron and listened to the almost-sigh it gave before the sigh it would have given. \u201cIt likes being asked,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does not like being told. It refuses the work if I speak to it as if I had purchased it. The man who gave it to me coughed the way secrets cough and did not tell me where it came from but the word he wrote looked like \u2018stabler,\u2019 not because of staples but because of stables, I think. I think someone meant for it to keep things.\u201d\n\n\u201cStabler,\u201d Bram said, and his mouth tasted the word like salt. \u201cYes. The old word in the hills for a person who keeps sheep at night is not \u2018shepherd,\u2019 it is \u2018night-stabler.\u2019 Not a stable at all, of course, but the person who makes the flock decide to behave like a flock when the dark has other ideas. You put the nights together until the dawn can handle it.\u201d\n\nCorwin wrote that down without meaning to, as if the pen had its own flocking instinct. The Public Safety woman took a step closer to the seam. \u201cPave and stitch and fence,\u201d she said, trialing the words like she could hold one in her hand and discover its temperature. \u201cI can budget for fence. The city likes a fence so much it tends to forget what it is for. People will paint it and call it their friend. Will you show me what stitching looks like before we spend money we will be ashamed we spent.\u201d\n\nThe seam had a place where it kinked up as if a knee had pushed under it in a dream. Mara set the jaws there and did not close them. She waited the way you wait a kettle, pretending not to stand over it. The tool softened her palm with its warmth. She remembered stapling the peony to its stick and the way it had sagged because some things prefer bowing to being righted. \u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d she said to Bram, to test what an echo would do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be worse when it works,\u201d he said, very gently.\n\nShe closed the jaw. The sigh went out and came back to her like wind through a window you have cleaned too well, and the seam did not lie down so much as remember lying down was possible. The iron didn\u2019t melt; it never does what you ask when you are theatrical. The earth around it bound itself to the idea of itself at that spot. Grass that had been thinking about a career in line-making decided, for today, to be patches and not a path. A dog lay down and stretched and let its paws be paws and not direction. Mara pulled back and breathed for herself and not the city.\n\nThe shepherds made a noise like approval that had been taught not to trust itself. Corwin exhaled in relief in the way a man does when he has successfully placed someone in the correct chapter in his binder. The woman from Public Safety was already calculating how many lengths of fence made sense if you were going to keep wolves from pretending to be roads. Bram leaned on his stick and looked away because when something is good you sometimes have to practice not looking for a moment so you will be better at looking later.\n\nMara sat on the grass because knees. The world had a tilt to it when she lowered, like a plate on a table someone had kicked. The tool in her hand had its weight and its appetite and she felt, as she always did after she let it kiss the edges of a thing, that somewhere a seam had closed that should not have and she would be embarrassed by that later when she found it. She made a list in her head of the corners that needed auditing by afternoon. She wished she could staple time to something and then immediately knew better than to wish out loud.\n\nThey put up a fence where the seam met the easy road, not a prison fence, though of course a fence is always a cousin to a prison; they strung it with bells the shepherds brought that had belonged to nobody and everyone. The bells were not loud. They were the sort of bells you hear only when you are already thinking about bells. That kind are the most useful; they remind the world of itself. Mara touched them and they quieted. Her tool did not like metal on metal. It sulked. She petted it. Bram watched as if someone had placed his heart on the ground and then stacked walnuts around it very carefully.\n\nOn the way down the hill she found him walking beside and slightly behind her the way someone does who wants to be in your company and not your conversation, and then because he is not a fool he made himself a fool and said the thing no one knew how to say without ruining a day. \u201cYou stapled a cough,\u201d he said, so mildly that the needles of the words found her late.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI was sorry as soon as I did it. He wrote me and said his chest stopped troubling him and then he didn\u2019t know how to clear his throat when he was alone and someone spoke at the door and he hadn\u2019t had a chance to think yet. He said he sat there with his mouth open like a fish when the man with the pamphlets came and he could not conjure the cough and so he had to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too good a tool for a person,\u201d Bram said, as if he could tuck the pronouncement into a pocket and hope never to have to take it out. \u201cIt makes invitations.\u201d\n\nLater, after fence and bells and a blunt conversation with Corwin about forms, the Council called a meeting in the clay arcades. Laleh sat on a pottery wheel like a queen of things that spin and a girl filled a jug with questions and then poured them on the floor in a shape that looked like ambition. The locksmith\u2019s pretty son leaned in a corner he had not asked permission to lean against and smiled at things that did not exist. The city attended the way the city attends when it smells a change: it bought cinnamon in lengths and argued about umbrellas and left early and came back to complain that it had missed the important part.\n\nThe sheep came. Not as a column. As themselves, which meant as a decision distributed over many animals and held together by notes. You could hear the bleats and tell that some were boredom and some worry and some hunger and some the sound a creature makes when the hoof is clean and the field is quiet and there is work and no sword. Helmets under arms, they walked without marching and stood without arranging themselves into meaning you could get from above. They watched the corners like scholars of geometry looking at somebody else\u2019s theorem. The leader had the wrong tooth and the scar that looked like the piece of a moon. He dipped his head. It was not submission. It was politeness.\n\nCorwin stood on a crate because he wanted very much to be taller just for today, just until the pen he held felt as useful as he hoped. \u201cWe propose a charter,\u201d he said, in a voice he had practiced that morning in a mirror and in the kettle. \u201cNot a treaty, because a treaty presumes we could both be somewhere else if we liked. A charter presumes we are where we are because we care to be and because we intend to carry on being here under certain conditions. Conditions include: you don\u2019t take our corners; we don\u2019t pretend your eyes are circles. You warn us about wolves, the path kind, the tooth kind, the people kind. We warn you about our unpredictable habits, which are legion and were raised without oversight. We will accept bells. We will not accept pens in our bedrooms.\u201d\n\nThe leader listened, which looked like chewing. Bram stood alongside and said nothing because sometimes the right amount of shepherd in the room is exactly one, and he had decided he had already been that today. Laleh wrote. The crowd made a noise that could go either way and pinned it to the air like a piece of laundry so that they could point later and say, we said something.\n\nMara watched the leader\u2019s eyes go door-wide when a cloud moved. She watched the way the sheep did not like the sound the pottery wheel made when its belt slipped and the potter swore softly, fashioning the air back into his own. She held the stabler down by her side and hoped no one would ask her to hold up her hand and swear. She did not want to. She wanted to staple the idea of a charter to the day and then take her pockets for a walk. She wanted Bram to say something gnomic and wrong that made her think for an hour. She wanted Corwin to be less careful. She wanted the boy with the kite to find the right wind and let it out like a sentence that knows it is going to be read aloud.\n\nWhen the charter had been spoken and the bleats had the sound of consent\u2014not exactly consent, something like \u201cwe are amenable\u201d\u2014when the bells had been distributed behind hands into a dozen apron pockets, people began to treat the sheep as sheep. This is to say: they tried to feed them. A child with a fistful of mint held it up and was nearly tipped over by a polite mouth. A baker brought the ends of bread like an apology to Scythes and offered them as if bread can solve allegory. Three men went off to get combs. A girl plaited red into her own hair in copy of a wrist she had seen and decided that would make her see like a sheep, which is the kind of magic the city understands. Corwin was given a bell and he jangled it exactly once and looked terrified by the thinness of the sound and did not do it again.\n\nMara excused herself before she could be asked to fix anybody\u2019s promise, and went to look for a crack. Not because she wanted to close it; because she wanted to be made to leave something alone. She found one where two stones met and had never quite forgiven each other for being near. She put her finger along it and felt how the day had slipped down into its little canyon and slept there quietly. She did not open the jaw. She did not sigh for it. She only hummed, low, a song she did not remember learning, a thing with no words that knew how to follow a line and not turn it into a path. The crack ignored her, which was its right. She felt better.\n\nThe wolves did not wait for the charter to be argued through the Council\u2019s appetite. They arrived that night under the sort of wrong that looks like wind. Bram had given her words for them: path-wolves of habit, of repetition, of the way the ground prefers to remember footsteps rather than make new prints. Corwin had given her words too: deliverables, metrics, engagement. None of those words helped when the first of them slipped along the iron seam and pressed its suggestion into the dirt near the fence and the bells refused to ring because the wrong was so polite. It was the hour when people think they are quietly being themselves and in truth they are most available to becoming someone else. The sheep heard them first. The sound they made brought the city to windows and then to shoes and then to the fence with cups still in their hands because all emergencies are improved by the presence of dishes.\n\nThey were not wolves the way a child draws wolves, with teeth like the crowns of hills and breath that makes frost jealous. They were long and low and did not quite touch the ground; they were smudges with decisions, precise where a foot should go and indefinite where a tail might be. They were made of every time you went the same way home because why not, you know it, it knows you, why test yourself. They pressed against the fence not with strength but with patience. They made the fence think about its favorite places to lean. The bells said nothing. The sheep bleated in a tone Mara had not heard and could not inventory. It was not fear, not in a way she had a label for. It was a sound like the number five.\n\nBram stepped into the groove a wolf had made and whistled a note Mara wanted to put on a shelf and dust. The wolf hesitated, the way a thought will when you interrupt it with laughter. Corwin came with his pen and the woman from Public Safety came with nine men and six women and a roll of chalk. They began to draw circles around the places where the ground had decided to become somebody\u2019s habit. Chalk is a kind of magic even grown-ups will keep in the kitchen. Laleh arrived with a notebook and did not write down anything except the way the sheep had lined themselves along the fence in such a way that if you were a wolf made of persistence you would feel the exact pressure of being watched.\n\nMara held the stabler and put its mouth to the fence where two wires touched and meant to keep meaning to. She pressed and felt the sigh go sideways, into the attention of the wolves, which is to say into the places where they were not yet wolves but could be if they were encouraged. She had not known she could do that. She set the tool at the seam and found the exact notch where the iron loved itself most, if iron can be said to indulge. She stapled that to the day, she stapled that to the fence, she stapled that to the way children turned their heads when their mothers said their names. She did not do it more than three times because Bram had told her once that three is the polite number when a person is listening and you do not know yet if they want to be persuaded.\n\nThe wolves pressed and in pressing revealed their edges, because everything that persists has to show you where it begins and ends eventually or else it never existed. She saw the noses, if noses are the first place a decision comes out of the dark. She saw the shoulders, if shoulders are the parts of a thought that move the rest. She saw the permanent mark they wished to make. She pressed again and fastened the moment to itself. One of the wolves stepped into a circle the woman had chalked and hesitated because chalk is old. It remembers when we used to write on the ground to ask the sky to take us seriously. It did not cross the line. It moved along the circumference and tried to become the circle\u2019s twin and tired and stopped and looked at its friends the way you do when you\u2019ve gotten lost and think you can pretend that was your plan.\n\nThe bells at last chose to admit that they had roles. They rang. It was not loud. None of this ever was. It was quiet enough to make you hate yourself for making too much noise with your thoughts. The sheep looked at Mara in a way that felt like someone had folded a page of a book you were trying to keep clean, and dipped their heads, and then did something complicated with their bodies that made the pressure change. It was a flock thing. You move here and you move here and you let there be a hole there and a wall there and suddenly the choice the wolf wanted is no longer inevitable. The path the wolf loved most had a hill in it of a sort that did not exist before and now did.\n\nAfter a long hour the wolves left. They left the way you stop thinking about a bad decision that wants to become a habit: you tell yourself a story about something else. They will come back. They are wolves. That is what wolves are for. The bells kept ringing after because bells take their time the way grief does. People went home with cups, finally empty, and shoes, finally noticed. Bram sat on the ground and folded his stick along his thighs and sighed in a way that was not at all like a seam finding itself; it was a way a person exhales when they have postponed despair without cancelling it.\n\nCorwin put a hand on the fence not to claim it and not to bless it but to discover if the fence was the sort of object that could be grateful. He found it could, a little, and smiled and looked more tired than she had ever allowed him to look. Laleh closed her notebook without writing the paragraph that would tell the city that wolves have good manners and bad ideas and that all of them are easier to manage than men.\n\nMara went home with the tool under her arm, which was asleep in the way tools sleep, which is to say ready. She thought of the man who had coughed and pressed pencil into paper to tell her a word she did not properly understand. She thought of the saucers on her table and the way they had organized themselves in her absence into a pattern that meant nothing and everything, as patterns do. She thought of the crack she had found and not mended and felt the pride of restraint and the itch of neglect. She fed the plant in the sink, which had been deprived of its water earlier by a tool with its own notions. It drank and forgave. Plants are good at that.\n\nAt the door she found a note under the mat because people still do that when they want you to find a thing with your foot before your eye. It smelled of pencil and wool and a kitchen with bread cooling. It said, in Bram\u2019s writing, which always made you think his pen had a limp: We need to go to the quarry tomorrow. Bring the thing. Don\u2019t tell Corwin until we are there. He will pretend he thought of it. There are sheep up high that do not come down and a sound that is not a wolf and not a bell and not the rain in the mouth of the pipe. We should listen to whatever it is saying to the iron. Also I have more coffee if you bring a saucer.\n\nShe read it twice and then put it against the cold of the window and watched it fog the tiny bit a note can fog. The city turned itself into shapes around her like a cat looking for the right shape to sleep in. She closed the curtains and let the day unhook from its corners. The tool in the sink did not look like anything you could write a rule about. It looked like a thing that would one day be a story someone else told, with your name in it if you were unlucky, with your face softened by time and other people\u2019s memory. She went to bed and lay on her side with one hand on her stomach and one on the blankets and thought about fences and wolves and the way you can staple a seam and still be kind.\n\nIn the morning the market smelled like cinnamon and rain. Children had chalk on their knees. A man had painted a bell on his door and then rang it until his wife said she liked the real one better. The sheep had left a pattern in the dust that Mara wanted to write down and then decided if she wrote down their pattern it would become easier to predict and she would be tempted to use that prediction like a hammer. She folded her coat the way Bram folded his stick and put the stabler in the pocket you put things in when you want them close enough to deny they are heavy. She brought a saucer that was cracked handsomely, because we should always put our best cracked things in circulation when we can.\n\nBram was at the foot of the quarry road, looking like a man who had already climbed it and decided to go again for the luxury of complaining. He had the air of someone who had been in company with a sound all night. \u201cThe sheep up there,\u201d he said, without hello because it was a morning when hello would have been a delay, \u201cthey stand on ledges and put their ears to stone and hum. I have never seen them do that. I think the iron is speaking to them. I think the seam is telling them a story about itself from before it was a seam. I would like to know if what they are hearing is a warning or a comfort. Bring your tool but do not put it on the iron unless it asks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does asking look like,\u201d Mara said, already her feet making decisions about where to find purchase on a slope that had forgiven too many people already.\n\n\u201cIt looks like every part of you being quiet at the same time,\u201d Bram said, which was not useful and always was.\n\nThe quarry opened around them like a mouth with its tongue torn out. There were ledges and scars and the smell of a world being made convenient for other worlds. The sheep stood like statues at intervals and put their heads sideways as if collecting rain in a cup made of ear. When they hummed, the air thickened the way a room does when someone you have loved finally says the thing they have been promising to say and you have no idea if it is what you wanted to hear. The hum had age in it. It had the grit of timelines. It had the shape of a road that had not yet decided which village deserved it.\n\nMara held the stabler and did not use it. Bram closed his eyes and looked like a man discovering an old prayer pinned under a new one. The sheep lifted their heads together and bleated once, a sound that sounded less like bleeding and more like the hinge of a gate being honest about needing oil. The iron sang back. It was not a wolf and not a bell and not the rain in the mouth of a pipe. It was a seam telling a story: I was the riverbed you forgot. I was the length of a dragon\u2019s sleep. I was where men in armor counted their steps and learned to stack metal on metal and call it safety.\n\nCorwin appeared at the top of the path because a man like that cannot be left out of a paragraph even if you try, carrying himself like someone who has already written down what is going to happen and will be embarrassed at how wrong he is but will recover. He opened his mouth to ask for permission to be in the presence of a thing he would eventually regulate. The sheep looked at him kindly and went on listening. Bram put his finger along the iron as if taking a pulse. Mara felt the tool shiver, not with fear, which it did not believe in, but with recognition. The iron did not ask, not yet. She let her fingers curl around the handle and waited to be quiet. She made a list of all the corners she would not touch today. She put her name at the bottom of the list, which felt like the right order.\n\nBelow them, along the seam, the chalk circles had caught a new shape. Not a wolf. Not a man. Not a sheep. A sort of loose, like a plan that had not been agreed upon but was walking around anyway seeing if anyone would mistake it for official. It moved toward the city and the bell fence the way a thought moves toward a sentence. Bram inhaled. The sheep stepped backward without any one of them deciding to. Corwin lifted his pen because you reach for who you are when you are afraid. The iron lifted its story by one octave and something under the earth cleared its throat. The stabler warmed in Mara\u2019s hand like a cat vowing nothing and promising everything.The iron sang again, and this time the note lengthened until it felt like a rope thrown between two boats. Mara felt it tug at her wrists and become the kind of question you didn\u2019t answer with words so much as with posture. Bram\u2019s eyes had gone narrow, not from suspicion but from care, like a man sighting the line between two long grasses to see what runs there, and the Public Safety woman had her chalk poised above the ground, waiting for the moment when a circle is a ceremony and not just a shape. Corwin\u2019s pen had found his breast pocket and stayed there as if relieved; this was no place for ink. The loose shape below\u2014an intention without a skin\u2014tested the chalk rim again and strolled along it, shoulderless and sure until it faltered at a corner and went dim because corners are interruptions, and interruptions are the only things that have ever saved a city. The sheep on the ledges hummed in thirds and then in a low ribbon of fifths, and Mara felt the weak places in the seam flinch as if embarrassed to be caught slouching. The tool in her hand leaned toward the iron the way a moth leans toward a porch light and stopped just before singeing because some lessons you only have to learn once.\n\nShe had been told to wait until the iron asked, and in the din of hum and thought and the audible stamina of stone, she heard it. It was not a word. It was a thinning, the sound a thread makes when a little boy pulls it through a hole in his sweater and the sweater considers becoming something else. It was not urgent. It was patient, which was worse. Mara lifted the stabler and balanced its open jaw just above a seam-shoulder that had tried too often to be a road and failed and then decided to make the failure permanent. She did not close it. She looked at Bram, whose stick rested against his leg like a tame river, and he nodded once, not as license but as witness. A sheep with a burr in its flank turned its rectangular eye upon her and dipped its head, and that was all she was going to get from the wool.\n\n\u201cIf you behave,\u201d she said quietly to the tool, which was the only way she could behave herself, \u201cI will find you something beautiful later to fasten that has no consequence. I will staple a ribbon to a child\u2019s hair and you may preen.\u201d The stabler warmed the way a face warms when you compliment the wrong thing but mean it kindly, and she closed the jaw on iron and air and wool together because there was a tuft caught on the stone and she would have been foolish not to include it in the bargain. The sigh moved through the ledges and through the chalk, which lifted in a draught and then settled into itself like a cat resettling in its own fur. The loose shape below stumbled over the suddenly well-behaved notch the seam made and broke into three smaller notions, each less convinced of its own inevitability than the last.\n\nCorwin exhaled as if he had been holding his breath since the sea was invented. The Public Safety woman squinted down the slope and then up at Mara as if to say: I have a warehouse of rope and barrels of nails and none of them do what you just did, which is both infuriating and a relief. Bram did not move. The sheep moved in a way that made the ledges look briefly like grammar and then like melody again, and one of them bleated a sound that had the comfort of a closing door without the insult of being shut out. The iron\u2019s story softened back down to where it could be ignored by a man buying a pie and cherished by a dog that knew the difference between weather and news.\n\n\u201cDo not do it again here,\u201d Bram said, friendly as a fencepost. \u201cYou\u2019ve set the staple deep because you included what the seam thinks of itself. That means if you fix another length too close you\u2019ll make them call to each other and then we will have a wall where a seam belongs. People do not like walls unless they can paint them, and I do not wish to explain to the Council why we are suddenly a castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no interest in castles,\u201d Mara said, and it was true until the moment the word made a structure in the air and she realized: a castle is only corners with better publicity. The stabler settled against her palm and breathed. It did that, sometimes, when it had eaten well. She wanted very much to laugh and did not, because of Corwin\u2019s face, which had the look of a man who had just watched someone fix his job by accident. The Public Safety woman spoke first because that was her craft. \u201cWe will run rope down from the ledge,\u201d she said, pointing, \u201cand hang bells where the iron flinches. Your chalk circles can be made official. I can get the city to sign a paper that says we respect the difference between a road and a rut. It will make no difference to the wolves, but it will make a difference to men.\u201d\n\nThe loose shape down on the flat did not dissolve so much as lose credibility. A plan undone. It slid toward the sea like an idea hoping salt would fix it, which never works and always looks elegant. The sheep watched it leave with the mild disdain of a creature that has survived a thousand versions of a thing and knows all their endings, and then they turned back toward their ledges and put their ears to stone again as if the seam had gone back to telling them a story worth being quiet for. Corwin put his hand on the iron the way a boy in church pats a carved saint when no one is looking. He nodded, small, as if the iron had told him something he had understood and promised not to repeat. He was not the sort of man who would keep that promise, but he was at least the sort who would be embarrassed when he broke it.\n\nOn the climb down, when the air stopped buzzing and the earth resumed its old habit of pretending it never speaks, Bram shouldered his stick and let a breath out as if someone had called his name from very far away and then decided it was a different Bram they wanted. \u201cNight-stabler,\u201d he said, not fussing over the word as if proud to be holding something old enough to splinter. \u201cThere was a woman once, up in Prent\u2019s Fold, who bound storms. Not to the fence\u2014don\u2019t look at me like that, I can tell that\u2019s where your head goes. She tied them to themselves. Gave the thunder back to the clouds and the clouds back to the thunder and told the hill to sit down and not take anything personally. It worked, until it didn\u2019t. She did a fourth, after three, because somebody she liked was coming over the saddle and did not deserve to drown. She kept the storm for him and after that all our weather was tired for a year. Grain sulked. Children were listless. Even the dogs dreamed of shade. The hill forgave her, eventually, but it named a gully for her in a way that makes the gully a warning if you know your maps.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like three,\u201d Mara said, to make her mouth believe it. \u201cI liked three in school, when teachers made us speak to be certain we had learned. Once to say it. Once to demonstrate it. Once to be sure we would remember the shape of the saying. Four is show-off business. Four is thinking you are the outside of your own life.\u201d She gripped the tool until it ceased thinking about jumping.\n\nCorwin caught up, wearing the look of someone about to make himself useful so that he could forgive himself later for having been frightened. \u201cWe will need to draft guidance,\u201d he said, and Bram barked a laugh so abrupt the sheep on the ledge above them turned their heads as one. \u201cNo, listen,\u201d Corwin went on, a man pleading with laughter to be kind. \u201cIf we are to tell people not to overfasten their corners, we have to define corner. If we are to tell them wolves can be undone by chalk and singing and that woman\u2019s impossible device, we have to distribute chalk and bells and some species of patience. We have to tell people that they themselves are the best part of the fence and the worst, depending on the hour they wake.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut all of that on a poster,\u201d Mara said, and surprised herself by meaning no harm. \u201cAdd a picture of a lamb for the children to color. Add a corner\u2014no, two\u2014and a line in the middle one must not cross. Try to avoid words like mandate, which make people yawn and then rebel. Perhaps staple one to every door.\u201d She knew she had said the word on purpose and did not apologize for it. He deserved to have his verbs stolen now and then.\n\nThey met the shepherds where the path widened into conversation. A woman with hair like old straw made new smiled at the stabler the way you smile at a very large sweet dog that hasn\u2019t chosen a target yet. \u201cStabler?\u201d she asked, and Mara nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThe iron will talk faster now it has found an ear that knows when to close.\u201d She held out a hand. \u201cTamsin. I keep the bells from turning vain and the dogs from falling in love with their own work. If you need wool that has not yet learned bad habits, you ask me. If you need wool that has learned every habit and can teach you which ones are useful, you ask Calder, who has been old since birth and hasn\u2019t noticed. We will make a calling cry you can hear in your kitchen when we need you. It will sound like the kettle behaving wrong. You will be disgusted by it and you will be quick.\u201d\n\nMara felt her ribs grow a size and make room for a new kind of hurry. \u201cIf the iron asks and I am peeling potatoes,\u201d she said, and left it there because that was a better prayer than anything with saints in it. Tamsin nodded as if Mara had passed some exam that had never been written down. Bram, looking relieved to let someone else stand in front, turned to Corwin and said, \u201cWrite your charter, binder-man, but add a clause that says we are permitted to not be the sort of people who need charters on Wednesdays. The hill doesn\u2019t understand Wednesdays but it does like kindness. If you teach the city to do that, we might forgive it its squares.\u201d\n\nBack in the ring market, word had arrived ahead of them in the tiny feet of speculation and hung from awnings like drying apricots. People always think they deserve to be there when something important happens, and this weathered their disappointment by letting them tell the story wrong to the exact right audience. Laleh leaned in the doorway of the locksmith\u2019s stall with her notebook folded and the pencil tucked behind her ear like a proposal she intended to reject out of affection. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said as Mara came up the lane, soft as any prayer. \u201cI know you have a speech about three and restraint and why walls are rude. Save it for the Council. Tell me instead what the iron said. Did it mention me. Did it praise my posture. Did it complain about the way we all walk on it with our heads too high.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt told a story about when it was a river,\u201d Mara said, handing the other woman the saucer she had promised Bram and he had shoved back at her when she insisted on climbing again. \u201cIt told a story about steps. It did not mention you because it has decided not to flatter us in ways that make no difference. Your headline will have to do without references.\u201d\n\nLaleh grinned and made a face like she had just eaten a word that had improved her teeth. \u201cYou are cruel,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you. Cruelty is a kindness in my trade. Do you know that three men today asked me to write their names near yours. As if I were a grocer and fame a loaf. I told one I would write him next to Bram so that he could feel tall. I told another I would write him next to Corwin because he would be misquoted forever and that was a sort of immortality. I told the last I would write him next to the sheep and he cried. You should stop making allegory in public. It confuses us.\u201d\n\nThe bells at the seam were being strung by late afternoon, a pretty sound for an ugly purpose. The city had decided it would accept bells the way it had accepted saucers and saucer-women and fence-post poetry: with a shrug and then an opinion. Children stole pieces of chalk and drew circles around their own feet and declared themselves exempt from chores until the circles were scuffed. The locksmith\u2019s pretty son presented Mara with a ring of keys not matched to anything in particular and said, \u201cNo one should go to the hill without jingling; the wolves dislike comedians.\u201d She took it and felt how the cold metal made her tool sulk and smiled at the sulking because she was becoming that person, the one who found personality in steel and was not ashamed.\n\nThe first letter arrived that night from the coughing man who had given her the tool. It came folded around itself in a way that made you think it had been experimenting with other forms of envelope and had not liked them. It smelled of sachet and ash and, faintly, of sheep. The writing was thicker than she remembered, less frantic, more in conversation with itself. He did not sign. People who send important objects do not reveal themselves unless they mean to give you a second thing.\n\nI called it a stabler for reasons that have nothing to do with pins, the letter said, as if indulging her backstory. In the language I am no longer allowed to speak in public, it is a person. It stabils, which is to say it makes the jostled remember that they have elbows and should keep them to themselves. It keeps that which will be kept. It is more patient than any of us. It has rules, which is useful, and appetites, which is not. You should feed it chores, not chores that someone else has failed to do\u2014that will sour it\u2014but chores that no one person could do without becoming insufferable. If you can tell the difference you will be fine, or as fine as any of us are. Do not, if you can help it, make it an heirloom. This is a short-term device. The long term belongs to nothing we can hold.\n\nShe read it twice and then tucked it between two saucers where it would be hard to find and easy to reach. She made a list: corners done, corners spared, corners that would ask her in their own time. She wrote in the margins: wolves, bells, chalk, Laleh, Corwin\u2019s pen, Bram\u2019s gully, Tamsin\u2019s thread. She added at the bottom: dear. She did not cross it out. She drank water without tasting it, because her mouth had grown heavy with iron\u2019s story and she needed to let it forget itself for a minute.\n\nSleep came only because the city demanded it. The city is a tyrant and a nanny; it bolts your door some nights whether you agree or not. She dreamed as if someone had borrowed her head to classify a museum: cases labeled ROUTINE and IMPULSE and SHEEP and MEN and WOLVES and LOVE, with index cards tucked under each with notes to the curator about what had been mis-shelved and what had been stolen and what had been stapled by mistake. In the dream a boy put his nose to the glass of LOVE and breathed on it, and an alarm went off in the next room where someone was cataloguing brass. She woke with the lingering sense that she had been useful to someone less careful than she would prefer.\n\nMorning brought rain that behaved, which is to say it went where gravity told it and not where gossip suggested. The bells at the seam let themselves be quiet until a girl ran along them with a stick and made a song that had the exact number of notes necessary to get her scolded. Mara boiled water because she had promised the kettle a life of adventure and because Bram had threatened to appear without warning if she did not. He appeared exactly when it boiled, which is the sort of magic you can rely on when you have known a person for the right amount of weeks and also for your whole life. He did not knock. He held his hat by the brim like a creature and petted it absentmindedly as if it had been very brave out in the weather.\n\n\u201cThey wrote a clause,\u201d he said over the first cup, as if apologizing for somebody else\u2019s handwriting. \u201cCorwin and the Council. It says: \u2018In the matter of corners, all citizens shall endeavor to leave some for the air to tuck itself into.\u2019 It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s a sentence that knows what it wants to do with itself. There\u2019s a committee forming to define endeavor, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Mara said, fishing the letter from the saucers and sliding it across where Bram could put his finger on the place where a stranger had reminded them both that tools have tempers. \u201cHe says chores, not miracles. He says if I hand it a future to hold it will sulk until that future arrives and then drop it, which is a kind of justice and a kind of rudeness.\u201d\n\nBram read and nodded. \u201cHe is right. There is something in this that does not like our myths. It will not hold a prophecy. It will not hold anyone\u2019s hope if the hope has a face. It will hold exactly as long as kindness, which is to say until lunchtime and then again at tea.\u201d He set the page down and took another mouth of coffee and then set that down, too, because the bell in his brain had been struck by a distant hand. \u201cHear that,\u201d he said, and she did not, which frightened her more than the sound would have. He cocked his head. \u201cA new wrong. Not wolves. Not path. Not iron being asked to be a spine again. Paper. Too much paper.\u201d\n\nIt was astonishing how quickly the city could make a creature out of paper. By noon men and women who had never filled a form in complete sentences were collecting signatures with a fervor usually reserved for ship departures and births. They had found the quiet place at the heart of the Council\u2019s clause and they had decided to make it shout. Petitions sprouted like mushrooms: to require bells on every belt, to forbid wolves from appearing in allegory in classrooms, to prevent sheep from receiving combs without a license, to commission a statue of a woman holding a stapler on the plinth where the man with the sword had looked tired for a century and a half. Laleh was in the square with a laugh that had borrowed gold and was lending it at interest. Corwin stood on the steps of the Council building with a face like weather, trying to remember the taste of authority while not tasting its salt too greedily. The Public Safety woman had stopped three arguments by reminding their loudest participants where they kept their spines. The petitions grew teeth. Paper makes edges if you stack it enough.\n\nMara did not intend to use the stabler on paper. That would be indecent, like wearing your grandmother\u2019s pearls to a boxing match. She took it with her anyway and stood very still at the edge of the square the way you stand when a dance is happening that could become a fight. Bram drifted at an angle that kept him between a boy\u2019s ruckus and an old woman\u2019s indignation and made both of them steer better. The sheep did not come. The sheep had the better sense to be at the seam listening to iron\u2019s memory instead of counting the ways a city can be foolish in public.\n\nOne petition in particular wound around the others like a more convincing vine. It made no demand and carried no signature lines. It was a shape, drawn with ink the color of nights in your childhood, the kind where your mother moved through the kitchen and said nothing because saying would have woken the smallest child and the smallest had been an angel all day. The shape had corners and then did not. It had a gate and then it had a wall and then it had a seam and then it had a road, and if you held your breath and squinted you could see the path-wolves trotting along its edges pleased as boys who have been told to take the long way on purpose. Underneath, someone had written Why Not. It was not a question. It was a dare.\n\nMara felt the tool in her pocket roll over and open one eye. She felt the crowd, that organism with too many hearts, loose itself toward the wrong.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Corwin said through his teeth, watching her take the step that made the square bite down instead of swallow. \u201cFine. Come and staple our courage to our better natures. Do it gently, if you love me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never loved you at all,\u201d Mara said with the easy emphasis friends get to borrow when they intend to hand it back later. She did not look for a post or a rug or a fence. She went to the drawn shape and put the stabler\u2019s mouth on the corner where the wall had remembered it had been a gate and had been proud of the memory in a way that made it susceptible to flattery. She looked at Bram and he shook his head because this was paper and paper keeps grudges longer than iron. She looked at the Public Safety woman and she tilted her chin the way a dog does when it hears its favorite word and is uncertain whether it was truly spoken. She looked at the crowd and hated them a little for needing her, which is the right way to love a city.\n\nShe closed the jaw and the sigh folded the sound of the square back down into bodies. The drawn corner held. The gate did not become a wall. The seam did not forget itself into a road. The wolves that had been waiting in the tautness of air, in the impatience of men, lost interest like boys when you tell them the sweets will taste of cough medicine. The paper fluttered because paper must always pretend to be the wind in miniature. The petitions around it went on shouting in ink, but what they shouted had lost its verb. People looked sheepish and some of them looked like sheep, a little, which is what happens when you survive something you almost invited in. Corwin sat down on the steps and laughed until his eyes were wet and then stood up and pretended he had been conferring with someone important. Laleh came and looked and did not write and said, \u201cI could kiss you and that would ruin us both, so instead I am going to drink all your coffee and misquote you on purpose.\u201d\n\nIf the day had ended there, if the bell fence had found its pitch and the petitions had found their limits and the iron had told its story and slept, chaptering the afternoon into something like calm, the city would have gone to bed with a headache and woken with an anecdote. But the seam had decided it was a talker now, and talkers breed talk. Near twilight, when the clay arcades turn purple and the smell of cinnamon shifts into the smell of sums being done and sums being lied about, a sound came\u2014not from the hill and not from the square. From the water. A bell without a hand. A toll that had never been taught politeness. The sea began to ring.\n\nBram and Mara both looked up as if the sky had said their names, and Corwin finally did the one thing he was best built for and least praised for: he moved a crowd without being seen to move it. The Public Safety woman had men on the bell fence in a breath and women with chalk at the quays in two and by the third someone had decided to lower the harbor chain, which had always been ornamental but had liked to dream. The sheep arrived in a hurry that made no hooves sound, and you knew, seeing them, that this was their country in a way that streets never would be. Their wool had taken on the light of cockleshells. Their eyes were enormous doors. They went ahead without us and stood with their sleeves rolled up to their knees at the lip of the tide.\n\nThe bell the sea rang was not ours. It belonged to something that had been promised a long time ago and had come at last to collect, tired of our delays. The sound made tin taste of apples. It made shore birds forget their debts. It made a woman at the fish stall drop a knife and swear as if swearing were a prayer and prayers had just reminded her of how to be useful. Bruises hummed under shirts and were briefly proud. The stabler burned hot in Mara\u2019s coat, and for the first time she did not know which way to point its mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat is it,\u201d Corwin said, and he said it to Bram because this was not for pen or binder. Bram, who had more names for wrongs than anyone Mara had met and a calm for each, looked at the water and did not look away when it bucked like an animal with the bridle wrong.\n\n\u201cHarbor-will,\u201d he said, and took off his hat because some words require that ritual even on weekdays. \u201cOld pledge. The first men who stacked shields into a staircase stood at that chain and told the sea that if it wanted their iron it could have it but it would have to wait until they had done with it. The sea does not like to wait. It has been patient for a century and a half, and now it has scented our fussing and decided to try again. It will not take the iron. Not all of it. It will try to take our habit of thinking we can tell it when.\u201d\n\nThe sea sent a sheet up the chain that roared without spray, as if water had finally learned indoor manners. The sheep bleated a chord that made sailors cry for their mothers and then be embarrassed forever. The chain, which had been a prop in civic plays and a place to put your foot when telling a story to a child, stood into the sound and did not break. It did something worse. It learned the note and hummed back. The will in it woke, with a stretch like a man who has slept badly and is promised a good chair.\n\n\u201cCircles,\u201d the Public Safety woman barked, and the chalk women did their work without apology even though chalk and tide do not respect each other. \u201cCorners,\u201d Corwin said at the same time, almost without meaning to, because even a wave must decide what shape to take when it meets a quay. \u201cDo not staple,\u201d Bram said very quietly to Mara, and she would have been offended at being told her own business if fear had not curdled her blood into something obedient. \u201cNot the water. Not a bell that has no handle. If you fasten this, the sea will take your word as bond and we will never eat mackerel again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do,\u201d she asked him, for once not because she wanted to hear his sentences but because she could not find her own. Bram\u2019s eyes were full of ships he would never sail. He put his fingers about an inch apart and made a shape in the air. \u201cYou staple me,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the post. For three breaths. Only three. I will whistle and the chain will remember that it was meant to be friend and not father. Then you take the staple out. This one you take out.\u201d He held out his arm and it was an old arm and also it was a stick. He smelled like wet wool that knows the story of its own lanolin.\n\nShe had never un-stapled. She had assumed that was work for decay and time and salt. She reached for the letter opener, the bone-handled maybe-knife she had used on cinnamon toast and once to show a boy that paper is more dangerous than it looks. It had a notch near the tip, a small cunning smile she had never understood. When she slid it into the stabler\u2019s mouth, the tool sighed in a different octave and her hands knew without thinking how to set a seam loose. She had not been taught. The instruments taught each other while she slept, the way they always do if they share a drawer.\n\nShe pressed him to the quay. The sigh went out under his skin and into the post and made them family. He whistled the way he had whistled for wolves\u2019 thoughts earlier but differently, with a flattery in it that made water preen. The chain forgot that it had been counted and remembered that once it had been sung. The sea lifted and considered and put its hand down. The bell hushed\u2014not because it had been answered, but because it had been offered a better story. \u201cNow,\u201d Bram said, not loud, and she slid the bone under the staple-that-wasn\u2019t and lifted, and the sense of the thing let go and ran away like a child who has discovered that its prank has stopped being a game.\n\nThe sea went back to being too much for everyone. The sheep went back to being good at their work and indifferent to being honored for it. Corwin sat because his legs had endured too much being a public servant for one day. The Public Safety woman wrote down three things on the back of her hand and smudged them and wrote them again. Laleh appeared with hair wet at the ends and wrote a line that would later read as calm and had not been. The chain drooped into the tolerance we call slack. Mara wiped the bone clean on her skirt and had no regret for the stain.\n\n\u201cYou did not keep me,\u201d Bram said, checking his arm as if it were a separate creature and he a farmer at inspection, and she shrugged and then shook because sometimes what you have done arrives at your body late. \u201cYou asked me to be kept,\u201d she said, stubborn as any corner. \u201cThere is a difference.\u201d He put his hat back on because some men cannot endure gratitude in the open air and need brim for it.\n\nNight found the city tired and pleased to be. The petitions thinned and went to bed under dishes. The seam hummed a lullaby stolen from a shepherd long gone. Wolves lay in their chalk circles and complained of boredom to no one in particular. The bell fence wore fog and looked holy. In her kitchen, Mara put the stabler and the bone into the sink together and felt them knock teeth, an intimate and irritating sound. She set the saucers back into their pattern and found, in the un-useful space where the pattern failed itself and the table insisted on being wood, a place where her hand could rest and mean it. She ate bread without butter and did not apologize to anyone for liking it. She put wool beside the letter and the letter beside the spoon and the spoon beside the day and decided, not for the first time, that being tired was a kind of prayer that the morning generally granted.\n\nThere is no moral for a day like this. The best you can do is promise to tell it true later, and then keep finding ways to keep your later from becoming a rut. The city slept the way a pen runs dry: usefully. The sea, having been flattered, permitted itself to forget we existed until it needed us to make a story more interesting. Above, in the quarry, sheep pressed their heads to iron and dreamed of grass because everyone dreams of the thing they have already. Bram lay on his side with his stick between his knees like a fence he needed to keep nearby so he didn\u2019t dream of breaking it. Corwin dreamed of signing his own name in a ledger that forgave him for ignorance and felt, the moment before waking, what it would be like to mean it. And Mara, in the small upslope of an apartment that had once been a broom closet and had become a bridge, slept between her tools as if between two versions of herself and woke at dawn with the taste of bells in her teeth and the certainty that the quiet between three and four would not belong to any creature tomorrow.Mara woke from a dream in which saucers had argued about gravity and the argument had left a taste of steel on her tongue, and it took a minute for her to be certain that the mouthful of bells she carried into the day belonged to night and not to a mistake she had made just now with her teeth. The tool in the sink had shifted to the far side of the basin as if preferring the company of the bone-handled letter opener, which made domestic sense in the way a spoon decides a drawer is friendlier if a whisk is nearby. She put water on because Bram would arrive as if tied to the boil, and while she waited she did something she had only thought about, which was to ask the bone to teach her a rule. She slid it into the stabler\u2019s jaw and felt the little notch find a place like a tongue finding the sweet seed in a pomegranate, and she closed her eyes and pictured the seam at the quay where she had fastened Bram to the post for three breaths because he had asked. The notch warmed, and the muscles along her thumb told her unfastening has a different courage in it than fastening, and the water began to complain in the pot in the exact voice of Tamsin\u2019s promised calling-cry and then remembered itself and behaved. She did not try to unmake anything that did not ask. She had learned to listen for asking the way some people learned to watch for a child\u2019s lie to go glossy before it fell apart, and it made her tired to admit that what she had of wisdom had been purchased with that kind of eavesdropping.\n\nBram did not knock, which meant that something had gone right in the night and he had saved the knocking for the day when news would come in a bad hat. He put his stick on the table the way a man lays a violin down because he intends to tell someone why he no longer plays and then hopes they interrupt him before he has to. \u201cThe chain slept,\u201d he said, accepting his cup with his mouth already shaped around thank you and not using the words in case it dented them, \u201cand the wolves grumbled and lay in their circles and tried to trick each other and were bored by their cleverness. Tamsin says the iron told a story about ships that begins with the word no and ends with the word maybe and she is happier than I have seen her since her dog decided to like a baby. How is your convalescent instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sulks if I group it with cutlery but preens if I make it think it is an heirloom,\u201d she said, and then would not let her face do the work of a smile, because there is a moment after a night when a sea has rung at you when your mouth should not lie even to comfort a friend. \u201cThe bone has a notch for undoing. It taught me while I slept, which is rude and a kindness. It will not release a seam if I fastened it for pride. It will only let go if I ask it to forgive me for making a choice it knows I made under duress. It has opinions and they are petty and right.\u201d\n\nBram lifted the bone, which was a delicate thing, heavier near the unnecessary beauty at the butt, and balanced it along his knuckles until it told him to be careful and he obeyed before he knew he had. \u201cEverything that undoes has opinions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why promise-breakers in the hills are made to tell the same story of their breaking to three different children on three different days; if the children believe the breaker, the promise was faulty and can be undone without cursing the weather. If one child finds a selfishness the other two did not see, the breaker keeps their shame for a while like a stone in a pocket to keep him from walking too fast into comfort. You should not use the bone on Wednesdays unless you are prepared to have your neighbors tell you later that they felt treacherous all afternoon and could not say why.\u201d\n\nThe kettle did an ungainly thing with steam that smelled, faintly, of wool, which meant the hill had breathed and the city had noticed. Mara poured and found the luxurious quiet that attends a day that intends to be difficult and is gentleman enough to give you coffee first. Corwin arrived with a newspaper under his arm and a page of the charter folded open to another page that scolded the public in an approachable font, and he stood with his back to the sink as if it were a door to a garden and he was making a point of not leaving as a way of showing his good breeding. \u201cWe are to sign,\u201d he said without invoking a subject for his verb because he had decided the city counted as that when he was in her kitchen. \u201cAt noon, in the arcades, with the bells strung and the sheep obliging us by not being late. The clause about corners has survived with fewer teeth marks than I expected. The clause about not attaching bells to infants in their prams has caused a rift with a certain class of parent. I will stand on a crate and say endeavor as if it meant love and hope the crowd knows the difference, which it does not.\u201d\n\nHe put the paper down, and the headline Laleh had written about the sea without naming it like a person who knew the force of proper nouns did a small bow across the grain of Mara\u2019s table. The pretty son of the locksmith arrived in the door in a tie askew and a question already written on his face that had nothing to do with keys. He was the sort of boy who made women who had made their peace with practical shoes reconsider laces, and he was the sort of boy who did not know it yet, which is the only safe version. \u201cMay I borrow a sliver,\u201d he asked, pointing not to the stabler but to the bone. \u201cAll I need is the smile on the tip. A bit of steel to lay in wax, for a cast. Someone is making a picking tool that undoes latches in the name of liberty and the name of liberty is a different man every afternoon. They asked me to cut a groove because I cut grooves the way my mother cut bread, without wasting the middle. I told them no, and they told me they would get it somewhere else, and I came here to be told I was right and to be called a fool if there is a third choice I do not see.\u201d\n\nMara did not hand him the bone because there are errands that should make a boy walk to someone older than desire, and she did not send him away because she remembered being the sort of person who wanted to be useful and could be tricked by any tool that shaped its mouth in need. She put her fingers around the opener\u2019s plain side and felt it say today is for refusals with gentle syllables, the way a grandmother tells a child no with a story about a fox, and she gave the boy the saucer that had been cracked handsomely and said, \u201cPractice your groove on this. A plate knows what it is to be asked to become something it is not and will teach you patience without giving you everything. If they ask you again, send them to me or to Tamsin. If they go to the men who sell rope in the alley behind the coops, the rope will learn their names before they know it and will expect to be paid in something other than coin.\u201d\n\nHe looked wounded in the way you can be wounded when you came for sanction and were given a lesson, and then he looked proud because the lesson had used him as if he were already real. He took the saucer, which shaped itself to him as if it had been looking for a young hand as a justification, and he bowed in the way boys forget how to do the moment someone lets them start wearing black, and he left with a promise to show her the groove and not to sell it to anybody with a hat that looked like it had been worn by three generations of men who had not read a book.\n\nThe square filled before the bells had finished practicing being polite, and it had that low thrum a market gets when everyone brings their very best disagreement and arranges it around fruit. The sheep came in a cluster that was not exactly a circle and not exactly an argument; they paused where the canvas made its favorite crease and laid their heads together in a way that made you want to be loved by something without hands. The charter lay on a table the grocer brought and was weighted at one corner with a bag of sugar and at another with a stone that had been a doorstop for so long it had opinions about thresholds. Corwin stood up on the crate and made endeavor sound like please, and the Public Safety woman stood beside him with her chalk in hand as if at any moment language might need to be put on the ground for the sake of a useful shape, and Laleh stood behind with a pencil that did not like lying and was prepared to be forced if it made the truth kinder.\n\nMara stood among the neighbors and resisted the honest tug of the tool in her pocket toward any place where two things wanted to pretend they had always been one thing, and she watched as the city did what cities do when presented with a promise disguised as prose: it sighed, it cracked a joke, it remembered a funeral, it leaned forward like men at a window when a cat attempts something athletic across the street. Bram took up a corner of the table because even a charter deserves a shepherd, and the sheep leader with the scar that would not be tamed put a hoof on the step and stared with a politeness that could be mistaken for dullness by anyone who had not watched a flock decide where to sleep. The clause about corners was read and came out of a different mouth than the one that had written it and still survived because the crowd had heard themselves in it in the weeks when they had stood near a corner and felt the weather settle there to rest. The clause about bells was read and a man who had been drunk on bells for three days shouted that he had been cured of the thirst by the sight of his neighbor\u2019s hat adorned with two and everyone made a helpful noise that was not forgiveness and was better.\n\nWhen it was Mara\u2019s turn to come up the crate because the City needs to use small, familiar bodies to trick itself into a sense of continuity, she did not recite three. She thought of doing it and then she remembered the way Bram had said the name of the woman who had tied a storm to itself and made weather sulk for a year, and she told them instead about unfastening and about the way saying yes and then no to the same seam makes a room feel like a courtroom. She told them about the bone and the notch and the rule she had learned before coffee, that you should not undo in pride what you did in fear and vice versa, and if you cannot tell which you did, you should wait with your hand on the table until you can. She said the word mercy aloud and did not apologize for it. They listened as they always listen when the thing is the size of their kitchen and not the size of a wall.\n\nAfter, while people formed a polite war to sign the charter without looking like exactly the sort of person who enjoys signing charters, Tamsin arrived with a coil of red thread fat as a cordial and wrapped it once around the leg of the table and once around her own wrist and twice around the bag of sugar, and she looked at Mara with a humor that came from living far from metaphor and said, \u201cWe went up to the far ledge and found a thing that is going to try to be a habit while we are busy with paper. There is a place where the seam would like to split itself and roll down like a rug toward the sea and become useful as a common path for men who carry loads too heavy for kindness. It is singing in thirds. That is the kind of singing stone does when it thinks about giving in. The sheep do not like it. If you can spare your scarred friend and your man with the chalk and your boy with the questions and that person with the pen who keeps saying deliverable as if it were holy, we would like to take them all up after soup and ask the seam to be unreasonable for a bit longer.\u201d\n\nSoup made the crowd consider themselves loved, which is the easiest way to get them to forgive the city for making them assemble in weather. Mara found the kettle at one end of the arcades like a defeated cannon and Corwin found ladles in a warehouse that had never before believed it contained anything the world would eat, and Laleh, whose expertise did not extend to broth, found an elderly man who had been waiting a long time to be asked to stir and let him tell everyone next to him how to make a stock without stock until they felt nourished by stories and not by vegetables. The soup had the taste of a compromise that had cooked long enough to be its own kind of food, and afterward the uphill exodus had the feel of a wedding procession no one had planned and everyone remembered from a dream.\n\nUp high, the seam sounded like a machine learning to be a person in an unsatisfactory novel and like a person learning to be a machine in the sort of poem people recite at wakes because it is easier than silence. The sheep stood in two lines that made a narrow corridor for air and a broad gate for meaning, and Tamsin\u2019s bell hung from a post and refused to ring out of loyalty to the kind of quiet the hill prefers. The place she had spoken of was a kink in the iron where the stone had learned men\u2019s weight as a dialect and was now tempted by the fluency of surrender. The kink tugged at itself, and the ground near it had taken to leaning, a slouch that invited hooves to make it worse. Bram closed one eye and held his stick like a tuning fork and the Public Safety woman drew a circle not on the ground this time but in the air with her hand, and Corwin\u2014who had not argued about coming because even a binder wants to be early for once when a page might change underneath his palm\u2014stood with his mouth closed on purpose and his pen nowhere near thought.\n\nMara did not put the stabler on the seam because the seam had not asked yet, and she did not tap the bone against the tool to remind it of their agreement because that would have been a performance and the iron disliked theater when it was in pain. She touched the kink and tried to be quiet in all the places Tamsin respected, and she felt the ask in it come reluctant and shy as a child who apologizes because someone taught it to, not because it understands. The iron did not want to be brave. It wanted to be congratulated for considering it. She had known men and women who were made of that. It made her tender to feel it in a seam.\n\n\u201cNot this,\u201d she said, the way you say to a cat about to make a mess of a guest\u2019s coat, but with more respect because the seam was older than cats and had been polite longer. \u201cNot this time. There is another path we can give the heavy men. Corwin, do you have rope. You always have rope. It is one of the ways you make it easy for us to forgive you.\u201d\n\nCorwin did not have rope because he never has exactly the thing he would be proudest to have, but he had forms with string and the string was stronger than it looks when it wants to prove a point, and Tamsin had thread that had remembered the weight of a hundred bells and therefore was arrogant enough to hold more. They lashed together a courtesy and slung it across a lower shelf of stone and made a way that was not the seam and would do for any man who could be persuaded he would get back down the hill alive if he obeyed a rule for as long as it took to sing a song. The seam eased in the way a child does when you replace a sweet with a story. Mara put the stabler to the air near the kink and closed it on nothing and listened to the sigh go out and come back like her breath after a hill she should not have climbed and felt the iron believe itself again in this place and be glad.\n\nOn the way down, the pretty son of the locksmith appeared from a ledge where he had obviously been practicing being older than his mother and he held out the saucer she had given him and showed her the groove. It was a handsome curve, too shallow to hold a sin and too bold to be ashamed of itself, and he had cut it with a patience she had only ever seen in gardeners and men who change their own minds. \u201cThey came back,\u201d he said in a rush that made his words step on each other like cousins, \u201cwith money and with a promise they did not intend to keep about using it to free doors that had been shut by people with unclean intent and I told them to eat a shoe. I returned the coin to the smallest one who had the kindest mouth and said I would carve him a handle instead that fit a door that fit a room that fit a table where he could stop thinking he had the right to walk in and tell other people to be rearranged. He did not like my speech, but the coin felt what it feels when it has done wrong and wanted to be in its own pocket and I let it.\u201d\n\nMara took the saucer and touched the groove and felt how the curve had turned the broken into art without teaching it any lies about utility. She wanted to say three things at once\u2014the first about pride, the second about safety, the third about a time when she had cut a line in a piece of paper because she could not find a notebook and how that line had turned into a week and a sea\u2014and so she said none and instead asked him if he would like to go down into the ring and hold a bell for an hour, because that was a way to make a boy feel seen without making him a hero, which is a rudeness.\n\nThe charter signing, when they did it after soup and after the hill had been persuaded to be boring again, had the ceremony of children promising not to peek on their birthdays. People lined the page with names that looked like fields and names that looked like law and names that looked like birds that would not live even into next spring, and they flourished their pens and they compromised their spelling and they made marks that would stand in for hands when hands were elsewhere, and Corwin endured it with patience that brought tears to a man nearby who had not expected to feel anything but the draft. The sheep were offered wreaths of thyme because no one can entirely resist improving nature with an herb, and they ate them because that is what you do when a human offers you food with sincerity, and then they left a pile of wool near the table and Tamsin took it and tied pieces to the wrists of the children who hung back and pretended not to mind.\n\nNight came with rain that had learned to find corners and be tender there, and in the dark a new wrong slipped along the edges of roofs with the particular silence of malice trying to make itself look like weather. There were men and women who had decided they did not care to read a charter and had learned very quickly where the bone\u2019s notch found its work, and they had nothing so decent as a tool to help them; they had fingers that had cut buttons from coats in markets and minds that had practiced being pleased by slack. They chose two corners, then six, then sixteen, and undid the holding Mara had done as if snapping thread and saying see, see, see, the seam only held because someone was watching. The city woke in the wrong places, at stairheads and at the backs of cupboards where the darkness should be lazy, and bells answered in disgust and then in horror, and by the time the Public Safety woman had men out with chalk and none of it doing any good because chalk is a sermon and you cannot preach to someone whose face is turned to the wall, the kettle in Mara\u2019s kitchen made the sound Tamsin had promised and made it twice because once would have been manners and tonight they needed something more like urgency.\n\nOut in the arcades Laleh lit a candle and held it under her chin until she looked like an idea everyone had had and not credited, and she told three boys to fetch sugar and three girls to bring string and she told a woman with a scar like a comma on her wrist to stand in the center of the square and be an object to gather around, and she sent a child who had learned to run without moving his shoulders too much to Bram\u2019s door with no words, and she went to Corwin and took his pen out of his hand and put it behind her ear so he would remember how to speak without writing first. Mara took the tool in one hand and the bone in the other and went where people had allowed the wrong to begin because the wrong is always more polite there and less energetic and therefore easier to embarrass.\n\nThe corners they had undone were the small domestic kind, the remedying sort that had kept a mat from sliding and a door from ever so slightly denying entry to a man who would later be thankful for the delay. She fixed two and refused a third and sweet-talked a fourth and found that her anger made the tool heavy and her sorrow made the bone kind. Bram arrived with his stick and a dog that had been a joke that morning and was a hero tonight and he put his body in a threshold and made it a corner by wanting something good very hard, and the wrong changed its mind about whether this was going to be easy and went across the square to find a different kind of slack. Corwin, who is always at his best an hour after he is forgiven, found a boy with chalk and taught him to draw a circle around the place where a door meets a wall so that when a hand touched it from the outside the chalk would tell it that hands are for holding and not for taking, and the boy glowed like a coal in a pocket.\n\nIt took until rain gave up and learned humility again. It took until the string across the square acquired knots the shape of excuses and the shape of prayers, and Laleh recorded neither because it is not the job of newspapers to make us look worse than we are when we will do that for ourselves by noon. It took until the child with the good running told Tamsin that the kettle had been telling secrets and Tamsin came with thread on both wrists and said names to the wrong that made it blush, because wrong has a body and it hates to be called old. They caught two of the people who had undone corners and discovered, once again, that villains are very boring in their particulars and very interesting in their reasons; one said they did it because they wanted the sheep to like us more if our corners were loose, and one said they did it because he hated doors that open when you push instead of when you pull. They were taken home by neighbors who had their names and who would not let them become the sort of men who belong to stories.\n\nIn the morning someone had chalked on Mara\u2019s stoop three questions that were not questions and looked like they had come from a school where pens were treated like we treat birds, with food and hands always the same temperature. It said: Who asked you to keep us. What will you do when the tool runs out. Who will unfasten you when you are the seam. She stepped over them because breakfast, and because if she did not eat she would answer the chalk and the chalk would be too pleased with itself and go write it at the corner near the bakery where children like to scuff and could not be trusted not to improve it with dragons. She boiled water and ate bread without butter again and put the wool Tamsin had tied to her wrist around the handle of the stabler and watched it look better when it was less certain of itself, which is a look she had admired in men and loathed in guns.\n\nThe note came from the coughing man before noon, folded the way a person folds when they apologize to a chair for bumping it with their hip, and it told her a thing that made her sit down without being taught by her knees first. There is a brother to a stabler, he wrote, and he drew a picture bad enough to be honest and good enough to be useful, and it had a jaw too, but its jaw closed the other way, and it did not sigh, it hissed, and it did not bind, it taught a thing how to forget how to be two when it had been two for good reasons. He called it a separator, which was a true name and a treacherous one, and he told her a man had been seen with one near the ring road seven years ago when a bridge had chosen not to fall until later and was persuaded to do now what it had planned to do after the feast, and that the man had not been seen again because sometimes a city, out of love, will seat a person in a chair and put a biscuit in their hand and wait with them until they forget why they had left the house at all.\n\nMara went to find Corwin because there are things you should not keep to yourself even if you can make a joke about saucers later, and she carried the letter and the bad picture and the bone inside her coat like she would a baby if she had ever had the chance to make that mistake, and she found him at the Council building not reading a petition but watching a crack in the stone as if it had written to him personally. He took the paper and did not pretend to be surprised because good officials practice their face until surprise is a private hobby, and he did the good thing he does sometimes which is not to speak until everyone else in the room has forgotten why they wanted to. \u201cWe will be asked,\u201d he said at last, \u201cto get one. Someone with donations and blue ink will think owning a separator makes us strong. We will be told it is for emergencies. We will be shown a wall with a door that should be open and an old woman who cannot get in because the door has swollen with weather and we will be told we are cruel if we do not use the hiss. I need you to tell me no.\u201d\n\nShe said no in three ways, because she knows a bureaucrat must take no like medicine and then like dessert and then like brandy if he is to be cured. She said no because there is a difference between removing a hand and removing a habit and only one keeps you from ever taking a hand again when it is offered. She said no because there are seams in men and women that should be allowed to keep their secrets even when they have been careless with the secrets of others. She said no because she loved him, which is to say she trusted him to tell her, later, when she was wrong, and to sit with her in a kitchen while the kettle admitted it had been wrong about itself again.\n\nThey put the charter up on the wall of the clay arcades and tied it with four woolen bands at the corners so it would be hard to pretend it had flown away by itself when the first westerly came, and Laleh ran her fingers along the edges as if teaching the paper to tolerate hands, and on the first night afterward the sea was quiet, the wolves were bored, the petition men went home and swept, and the sheep slept as if the iron had told them a bedtime story about a hill that had learned the trick of staying exactly the same through four different kinds of weather and had not been punished by a god for it. Mara washed two saucers because they had been out in the air and had collected a rumor and she is particular about rumor on plates, and she set the tool on the towel and told it something no one had asked her: You are not my life. You are a way my life is being useful and I will not forgive you if you try to become more than that. The tool was heavy and warm and pretended not to hear, which was an improvement in their conversations. Bram sat on her step and did not knock and combed the dog\u2019s ears with his fingers until the dog sighed in his sleep as if someone had tied a ribbon on a memory and put it back on the correct shelf.\n\nIn the days that followed the city learned to say endeavor as if it meant promise and to say mercy as if it meant arithmetic, which it does if you have ever counted someone\u2019s faults and found yourself better at math than you like. The bell fence caught three wrongs before breakfast one morning because wrong is always hungrier than we are, and Tamsin\u2019s thread tied itself into a phrase a girl could hum while sweeping, and the Public Safety woman developed a way to stand with her arms that made men with tools feel they were holding toys, which is a talent handed down from mothers to daughters when no one is watching. The pretty son of the locksmith made a key that opened nothing and he wore it around his neck and boys he used to be cousins with patted it and tried to ask without asking what it meant, and he told them it meant he could be relied upon not to open anything that had been closed with regret, and that sort of honesty does something to a neighborhood that paint cannot.\n\nThen, because ordinary is always brief even when you wish it were not, the kettle cried Tamsin\u2019s wrong with the note that meant hurry and politeness both, and the dog lifted his head because he had dreamed the cry at the seam and was glad to be asked for work by a sound he recognized, and Corwin appeared not at her door but at the corner because he had learned what corners to stand in when he did not want to be noticed by the wrong people, and Bram had the look of a man whose stick had said a Particular will show itself and if we do not greet it it will put a hat on and we will not recognize our own fortune when it knocks. The letter from the coughing man lay on the saucers like a promise someone else would have to keep, and Mara put the bone beside it and took the stabler in both hands and said aloud the quiet thing that lets a person walk into a version of their life that would once have frightened them: I will endeavor. I will keep some corners for the air. I will staple you to your good sense if you make me ask twice. I will ask someone to unfasten me when I am the seam. She said it without making a speech of it and the room believed her, and the city, which is nosy, heard.The summons carried that unnerving mixture of hurry and patience that meant the hill had noticed a wrong and the city was still deciding whether to be embarrassed by it. Mara stepped into the corridor with her coat already on because her hands had learned, in the last weeks, how to move before her mind wanted to admit she had decided, and she found Bram at the corner in that shepherd\u2019s half-shadow he made when he intended to usher a day toward a better ending. Corwin waited ten feet off with his pen put away and his attention out in front of him like a lantern, and the Public Safety woman\u2014who, it turned out, had a name after all and was irritated with herself for not having given it sooner\u2014Hesta, nodded as if she could make the morning bow to a sensible timetable with mere chin. Tamsin\u2019s thread flashed at her wrists like a pair of small, red thoughts. \u201cIt isn\u2019t wolves,\u201d Hesta said before anyone could poach her business with worse vocabulary. \u201cSomething is teaching the edges to be proud.\u201d\n\nThey followed the sound of bells thinking it over and turned under the brick arch by the Registry, where men who liked to be obeyed as a profession had kept maps on the walls so long that maps had learned a smell from the rooms. The wrong had come for the place where names are married to numbers and numbers persuade doors to behave, and it had been genial about it in the way a con is genial. House plates lay on the ground separated from their screws as if the two had been introduced at a dance and had mutually agreed that they were better off as acquaintances. A row of files leaned like men at a harbor rail and then leaned a little farther, and a clerk put his hand out to prevent a spill and his hand hovered half an inch from the paper without touching because he could not remember if he was allowed. On the wall where the city kept its sense of itself as a whole, the map had curled at the edges and made a noise like a drying leaf. The chalk circles Hesta had ordered drawn at the Registry\u2019s four corners had fallen open into parentheses and then into commas someone had removed from their sentences out of spite. \u201cNo,\u201d Bram said under his breath, not as spell but as courtesy, and the wrong breathed in his face, cool and smug, the way vinegar sits in a bowl and pretends to be a sauce.\n\nThe first hiss came invisible and traveled through the frame of the Registry door the way a rumor travels through a family: in the grain, humming, persuasive. A man stood just inside that door and held in his hand a tool that had not been made for kitchens or quarries or anyone who respected the difference between keeping and owning. It had a jaw, yes, but its jaw closed backward, as if it preferred to teach things how to come apart than to show them how to stay. It exhaled a thin thread of white that was not smoke and not steam and smelled faintly of lemon gone wrong. He was not what villains ought to look like; he had good shoes and a coat that had been brushed, and his hat had a ribbon a woman with taste had chosen. He looked like a man you would ask to sign a paper because you believed handwriting could be an antidote to mischief. \u201cSir,\u201d Corwin said, stepping forward with his open hands the way he did when he intended to hide his authority in his finger joints, \u201cyou will put that down and you will tell me your name and you will sit, and if you are lucky we will make tea and call this a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nThe man smiled the way a person smiles when he has taught his face to pass for humility. \u201cIt is a misunderstanding,\u201d he said with the ease of someone who tells his own stories in court. \u201cI am separating error from habit. I am un-binding the city from the lies you bind it with. There is a law against fastening what should have been allowed to find its own shape. You have been busy with staples. Permit a correction.\u201d He pressed the jaw to the edge of the map\u2014just to the corner where the ring market made its round flirtation with the clay arcades\u2014and the hiss went out so quietly that a child coloring under a table would not have been startled, and the paper lifted its corner and decided it preferred to be a sheet. Mara felt her hand go to her pocket because there are gestures your body performs on your behalf when it senses that your thinking is about to be laggard.\n\n\u201cParticular,\u201d Bram said, and the word came out in him like an old cough he had learned to like because it signaled thinking, and the man\u2019s eyes slipped to him as if bothered to have been named so quickly. \u201cHe is not a wolf and not a bell. He is the argument that every field, seen from far enough, is a patchwork without stitches, and that stitches are an insult. He is here to teach us how to call each square of grass by a different surname.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give your wrongs names in public,\u201d Hesta said, chalk poised. \u201cThey will come when called. Sir, I will ask again. Put your tool down. You are not city staff. You do not know how the Registry tolerates our bad habits. If you unfasten this map entirely, we will not remember which way the door is supposed to swing.\u201d\n\nThe man tilted the hiss\u2019s jaw toward a set of drawers that had been a coherent idea for three generations and exhaled. Two drawers eased away from the cabinet and let their labels slide loose so that the papers within became orphans of their own vocabulary. He took a step as if to test the floor for obedience and the floor, which had been good all morning, decided to become four planks instead of a surface. Mara saw fear on Corwin\u2019s face not because a stranger had brought a device into his Registry but because he had expected the day to be about signing and soup and now it was about asking people to agree to be one thing when they had been something else for a very long time.\n\nMara did not draw her tool like a sheriff, because the city would have laughed and that sort of laugh is hard to un-hear when you need to be obeyed. She took the stabler out and held it low and felt it turn in her grip the way a riverstone rolls in a palm to find the temperature of a hand it likes. The hiss turned its mouth toward her in a little mockery of friendliness, and the man holding it inclined his head as if greeting a colleague. \u201cYou have the twin,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the lie. Put it away. Let this place unlearn its bad marriages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho taught you that word,\u201d Mara asked, feeling the bone-handled opener slide along the seam of her coat as if it would prefer to be first to the table if there were going to be lessons. \u201cWho told you the device hisses because it is righteous and not because it is bored. Do you know what happens when you separate more than you understand. You end up alone in a kitchen praising your own pantry for its independence.\u201d\n\nHe did not like the laughter that arrived at the edges of the Registry when she said that because it came from clerks who had not had the courage to laugh at him when he arrived. \u201cYou have fastened wolves to chalk circles,\u201d he said, hissing at the map again and making the markets flutter. \u201cYou have attached a chain to a promise as if promises appreciate hardware. You have stapled a man to a quay. I will not let you staple a city to your nervousness about change. There is a purer way.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s thread knocked against itself on her wrist and made a small cadence that meant be less theatrical and more useful. \u201cSallying on about purity is how we broke half a hillside twenty years ago,\u201d she said, stepping past Hesta and putting herself between the man and the drawers he had freed. \u201cIron likes to remember. Paper likes to warm itself against other paper. Wool likes to keep certain things in the same place for a hundred winters. If you intend to be in this town after supper you are going to have to be less interested in clean lines and more interested in soup.\u201d\n\nMara set the stabler\u2019s jaw on the corner of the map where the hiss had taught it to flirt with separation and closed it. The sigh climbed the wall with the kind of patience you learn from upholsterers and from old women who mend quilts with their hands and their tongues held a certain way, and the paper laid itself back into its old compromise. The man with the hiss grinned and moved quickly to another corner because wrongs are happiest when they can keep you turning, and Hesta stepped where he stepped and left chalk on the floor in a curve that dissuaded the boards from thinking of themselves as planks, and Bram whistled low the way he does when he wants a flock to notice a dog from the corner of their vision and be pleased by the competence of dogs, and three clerks put their hands on the drawers and reminded them that names and numbers, mismatched as they are, can learn to be cousins.\n\nIt would have been a dance if it had not been an insult. The man lifted the hiss and taught a hinge to forget what it meant to be hinge, and Mara took the thrust of that forgetting and stapled it to a memory she found in the air, something the Registry had kept without filing: the sound of a baby being named by a grandmother who had not been asked permission. The hinge took the memory and stayed in its pocket. The man hissed at a line on the floor that had taught children where to wait when they practiced manners, and Tamsin bent and tied her thread to the line and to her own wrist and stood and made patience fashionable. The man hissed at the corner of a book where the City had once written down a list of streets that wanted new names, and Laleh, who had arrived breathless and furious that the Registry should get to have the news first, leaned on the book and scribbled two syllables in a margin and made the book laugh and therefore unwilling to be persuaded that paper prefers to be alone.\n\n\u201cWho sent you,\u201d Corwin asked the man during a moment when more than three people had their mouths closed at once. \u201cIf you say the Council you are a liar without imagination, and if you say my mother I will take you to her and she will separate your head from your reputation and give your reputation to a cat.\u201d\n\nThe man looked disappointed that he had not frightened anyone properly and satisfied that he had unfastened enough familiarity for breakfast. \u201cI was sent by the truth,\u201d he said, and Hesta, who is not given to pearls of any kind, rolled her eyes so emphatically that a girl across the room did it too out of admiration. \u201cThe truth that your corners are crutches. The truth that your bells are vanity. The truth that a seam is only a habit you have taught iron and iron should be allowed to dress itself in water if it likes. The truth that sheep are just wolves who were given good press. The truth that the world was meant to come apart gracefully and perhaps singing.\u201d\n\nBram made a noise she had not heard before, half laugh and half sorrow, and the wrong in the room ate it with relish. Mara felt, in the small bones across the back of her hand, the way the stabler bristled at the notion that it existed for lies. She felt, as a smaller and more treacherous feeling, the way that hiss made sense when pressed against a very particular kind of hurt: the sort that keeps a spoon next to a photograph on a windowsill and pretends the arrangement will hold back time. She found the bone with her other hand and slid its smile into the stabler\u2019s mouth and kept it there as if they might reassure each other, and then she did something she disliked: she spoke of herself in public. \u201cI know a separation that needed doing,\u201d she said, not looking at Bram because then she wouldn\u2019t say it. \u201cIt was a cough once. It had its own music and its own manners and we had taught it into our afternoons. I took it away, and a man was left with his breath and without his punctuation and he discovered that he needed to learn another kind of noise for his own door. You are not offering that kind of mercy. You are offering to unfasten anything that makes us feel obliged to each other. That is not truth. That is a loneliness you want company for.\u201d\n\nHe did not scowl because men like him never have scowled in public; they have learned better tricks. He hissed at the map\u2019s title, which was the name of the city in a hand that had known nothing of wolves and a great deal of rain, and the letters twitched because pride is vulnerable under certain lights. Mara lifted the stabler and closed it not on the paper this time but on the sound of Hesta\u2019s own name as it had been spoken a hundred times by men who did not mean it and a dozen times by women who did. She stapled that sound to the map\u2019s title and felt the paper settle as if countries, too, are relieved to be reminded of who they are by someone who calls them by their right diminutives. Hesta\u2019s mouth quirked to one side because she had not said thank you in a long time for anyone fastening her in a place she would have chosen.\n\nThey might have played the Registry like an organ until noon and perhaps the wrong would have gotten bored and left to find a wall to scold, but the man with the hiss did the one thing that changed the day into a story Mara would have to tell carefully if she did not want to make a habit of fear. He turned the device not on paper, not on wood, but on a woman\u2019s hand as it rested on the edge of the drawer she had learned as a young clerk with a ribbon in her hair. He fit the mouth around her thumb and drew down, and the jaw kissed the skin and exhaled, and the drawer forgot it had been hers for thirty years, and the woman forgot which side of the counter she belonged on, and the wrong discovered a new appetite in the room and wagged its tail. She swayed and looked at her hand like it had missed a step and taken her with it. \u201cNo,\u201d Mara said, and her voice had iron in it because you can talk stone into good behavior if you find the patient vowels, and she crossed the space as Hesta did and Tamsin did and Bram did, and for a second they were a fence.\n\nMara put the stabler\u2019s open jaw on the space between the woman\u2019s thumb and the drawer, not on flesh and not on wood but on the memory that lay there like an old penny, of having once cut that thumb on a paper edge and bled a little and licked the wound and finished writing anyway. She closed her hand and felt the sigh go into a tiny, polite place, and the drawer remembered it liked being touched by someone who kept it clean, and the woman remembered the drawer was hers for another year unless she said otherwise, and the wrong lost interest in that seam because it was not famous enough to bother with. Hesta took the woman\u2019s wrist and tied a thread that had already had a hundred wrists remember themselves with its help, and the woman sat in a chair like a throne and held her hand like a baby and whispered obscene things at the man with the hiss because there are obscenities that are as useful as prayers.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Corwin said, and there was no pen in his hand and he had never sounded more like a citizen and less like an official. \u201cHesta, arrest him. Tamsin, if that device has a seam, you will show Mara where it is. Bram, if there is a whistle that makes a man reconsider his allegiance to romance, I would be obliged to hear it.\u201d He looked at the hiss with a hunger he did not pretend to have permission for and then looked at Mara and let the hunger turn into trust, which is the best trick he knows. \u201cDo not kill him. He is a person. Do not keep him. He is a person. Do not let him walk away with the city\u2019s vocabulary in his pocket.\u201d\n\nThe man did not run because he believed the allure of the clean unbinding would be enough to make them give him a corridor to leave by, and because he had moved through rooms like this in three other towns and been thanked afterward for the clarity he had provided when houses remembered they had stoves and did not need tables. Hesta did not reach for cuffs because there are moments when you must not confess to a wrong that it has the proportions of a crime; she reached for the woman\u2019s hand again and she reached for Mara\u2019s shoulder and she reached for the edge of the map, and in making those three gestures in one body she made a force that ignored the hiss and did not require it to be impressed.\n\nTamsin took the thread from her wrist and laid it along the mouth of the device without touching it, and the thread thrummed in a note Mara had begun to recognize as older than any Council. \u201cIt wants to learn a song,\u201d Tamsin said, amused in that furious way that makes children behave out of respect for a tone. \u201cIf you teach it a song, it will have to sing it before it can hiss again and the song will take time and we have time enough to be wise if we are not greedy. It has learned only one tune. It thinks it is an art to undo what is badly done even when the thing that was badly done has learned, from being badly done, to be useful.\u201d\n\nBram whistled something like the old morning call to lambs that had pulled their heads out of their mothers\u2019 flanks and were uncertain about being persons, and the hiss quivered and adjusted its mouth because a device that exists to teach a thing how to leave home is romantically susceptible to any tone that promises it could be part of a flock. Mara did a foolish thing and she will be forgiven later or she will not; she put the stabler and the bone together and bit down on the rim of the hiss\u2019s jaw with her own tool and pressed with a patient impertinence until the sigh laid itself across the hiss like a blanket and flattened it and took away its cleverness for the length of one breath. In that breath Hesta\u2019s hand came down not with a cuff but with a strip of leather she had used once to tie a door open at a birth, and she wrapped it around the hiss and the man\u2019s wrist and made them each other\u2019s problem.\n\nHe looked more frightened by that than by the threat of law. \u201cYou cannot tether me to my device,\u201d he said, which was the truest thing he had said since he came, and Tamsin smiled like a woman who knows ten different names for weather and the way each makes the bread rise. \u201cOh, we can,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have been telling it what you are for a week. Let it tell you. Let it ask you whether it really wanted to separate a woman\u2019s hand from her work. Let it hiss at your knuckles until you hear yourself. It will not hurt. It will be worse than pain. It will be instructive.\u201d\n\nHesta took him, not to a cell but to a chair in the corridor where a draft sits out its days, and set the chair in a circle she drew on the floor at knees and ankles and wrists because circles do their best thinking when they can find elbows to lean on, and she told him not to move and he did not because the hiss had become heavy in his hand with all the unfastenings he had asked of it and was asking if he might like some of his own seams untidied for a change. Corwin sat on the corner of the Registry table like a boy and rubbed his eyes with the heel of a hand that had not learned to tolerate tears and said, \u201cWe will not have one of those in this city. I do not care if they send me six letters with seals on them that cost a goat each. Put the word out: if you see a hiss, call it by its bad name, which is Separator, and if the man holding it looks like the kind of person who asks for more rope than he needs, send him to me and I will put him in a chair with Hesta\u2019s circles and we will give him soup until his device chooses to refuse him.\u201d\n\nMara put the map back and smoothed its corners and put her hand on the place where her part of town lay, a smudge of streets and courtyards and the small, obstinate lines people call lives. The stabler was warm, very warm, and the bone had that smug temperature that says somebody has learned something at last. She leaned against the edge of the table and felt all of her ages in her back, and Bram leaned next to her in the way of men who would like to be a stick but have been given the burden of skin, and they watched as the Registry remembered how to be one room and not several.\n\nThey had a day and a half after that when nothing resorted to devices but everything had the hum that follows a public wrong the way bees hang around a shirt that once smelled of honey. The city behaved with a politeness that felt like exhaustion and remembered how to salt its soup and share its weather and take notes. The sheep did the extraordinary thing of making no special arrangements at the bell fence, which oddly reassured everyone more than if they had lined up and performed; they pressed their ears to iron and to earth, not to listen for wolves this time but to listen for the thing that comes after a hiss has been in a room and left its opinion on the chairs.\n\nAt twilight on the second day, someone knocked on Mara\u2019s door without knocking, which is to say the house knew who was at the threshold and opened itself a little out of habit. The man with the cough stood in the hallway, hat in hand, hat in the sense of humility and hat in the sense of the actual object, and his face had that look of having been re-arranged by air and regret and coming willingly to be admitted to the number of the living. He did not look like a wizard because there are no wizards; he looked like a person who had been too proud of his hands and had gone to a hill to be scolded, and the hill had been efficient. \u201cYou may hit me,\u201d he said without preamble that would have flattered him, \u201cfor sending you a thing without a letter with more verbs in it, and you may feed me, and I will accept whichever you choose as the correct order.\u201d\n\nShe did neither at once. She pointed at the sink where the stabler lay and at the table where the bone and the letter and the wool were piled in that particular geometry that arises when you live alone and love too many objects. He put his hat down and his cough behaved in a way that told her he had made peace with his throat and its desire to have its own punctuation. \u201cIt is more beautiful than I remembered,\u201d he said, which is always the right thing to say about a tool. \u201cIt gets that sheen when it has been used for what it was meant for. If you had been cruel with it, it would be duller and you would be thinner and your eyes would be worse at noticing rooms.\u201d\n\nBram arrived two heartbeats later because you cannot keep him away from a narrative he has been wishing for in private. Corwin followed because whenever someone says they have brought the past into a kitchen he needs to write down at least two adjectives about it in case the Council asks for a memo. Hesta leaned in the doorway and let her presence be the polite threat it was, and Tamsin tied her thread to the back of a chair and pretended she had come to look at a plant. Laleh arrived with a notebook and a mouth that promised she would not write anything down that could be used against a woman in a decade by a man who likes shoes.\n\n\u201cYou called it a stabler,\u201d the man said to the room in which the city had collected in less time than it takes a kettle to lie. \u201cMy accent makes a hash of the old word. It is a person, in the language my grandfather tried to keep and my father was not invited to use in the army. It stabils. It keeps the nights together when the day has broken them. It binds that which will be bound, not in perpetuity but until morning can be brave again. Its brother, which you met today, is not men\u2019s work. It is a thing made for surgical winters, for the moment before two mountains decide to rip a river open and the people in the valley must be given a chance to move out of the way. We are not to hold it. We are not to hand it to men who love gates. I was wrong to keep it in a drawer when the city had its breath knocked out. I was wronger still to give you no rules when I handed it over. That is my cough, you see, in your kitchen. I want it to sound at the correct times.\u201d\n\nHesta snorted once because she has no patience for men who make poetry their apology, and then nodded once because she has a great deal of patience for men who bring their mistakes to her like cats. \u201cWe have made rules,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will approve of some and jeer at others. We will ignore your jeering. We will let you improve our rules when it saves us humiliation. Your separator friend is in a chair with a device tied to his hand until he remembers that devices do not absolve you of knowing what you are for. We will take soup to him at irregular intervals so he will not make a religion of bell times. The map is reattached. The Registry is one room. There are corners for the air. Thank you, for the metal. You may take one of the saucers when you leave if you like. We have many.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t send the other one,\u201d he said, contrition making him eloquent by accident. \u201cIt belongs to a different archive, one that does its thinking in houses and not in hills. They took it away from us in a winter when we had less bread and more argument. A group that named itself after roads acquired it and decided to call it a truth-tongue. They walked around teaching furniture that it had no obligation to be helpful. They like men who think about bridges more than people who cross them. You will see them, if you are not careful, looking at your chain down at the harbor like it is mispronouncing their God.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late,\u201d Corwin said, more gently than his words, because he had the grace to be tired. \u201cWe have seen them. We have combed their hair with the wrist of one of our own. We have fed them. They will think themselves persecuted for a week and then they will attach themselves to an argument about the width of the bell fence and leave us alone until they discover that bells are better in their mouths than on strings. Tell me something useful, sir, and I will give you a page on letterhead to write it on so that your language can regret it in comfort.\u201d\n\nThe coughing man nodded at the tool in the sink and then at the bone and then at Mara\u2019s hands. \u201cYou cannot keep it, not in the way you keep saucers,\u201d he said, and heartbreakingly for a childish second she felt the petulance of a girl told she must share. \u201cYou will have to make more than one person able to hear it ask. Tamsin can, and she knows better than to want to. The shepherd can, because his stick taught him when to be an interruption humbly. The chalk woman can, because circles listen for a living. The pen man can if he sits in a room with no paper and learns to speak in the old way, which is to listen without composing his answer in advance. You cannot be the only hinge. It will break you and you will embarrass it, and we will have to take it away and no one will be as good with it, and the city will decide to be as proud as a cliff and we will fall off.\u201d\n\nHe had a way of making sense and insulting you at the same time, which was exactly the sort of man who ought to live far from friends and close to sheep. Mara looked at her hands and saw in them what every woman sees at a certain hour if she is unlucky and working: the smallness of them against jobs which are not small. She could hear the kettle and the bell at the seam and the child in the arcades drawing a circle around his own feet and declaring himself under obligation to no one for the duration of the figure, and she knew, with the sort of conviction she had always suspected was a trap, that if she died tonight the city would keep breathing, which is almost a kindness. \u201cTeach us,\u201d she said to the man, and his cough behaved in the gap as if it approved of her sequence. \u201cTeach us what a no sounds like to metal. Teach us when to refuse an unfastening. Teach Corwin how to listen without planning a committee. Teach Hesta how to leave three corners when her instincts want four. Teach Bram how to let someone else whistle when his throat is proud. Teach Tamsin how to tie the air when we are not looking. Teach Laleh what not to write.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will do none of that,\u201d Laleh said dryly, but she smiled around the it and that softened all the edges. \u201cOr you will, and I will pretend to disapprove in public, and then I will go home and write a sentence that sounds like a person standing on their stoop after a storm and will hand that to the morning men and they will read it and make better coffee.\u201d\n\nThey did not, of course, all learn at once, because the hill does not give lessons to crowds. The coughing man showed them that the stabler\u2019s jaw will not close on a seam taught by contempt and that the bone will not release a holding made by tenderness. He taught Corwin to put his hand on the table and count to nine without numbers, which was comical and humiliating and left Corwin a better listener with a chafed pride. He let Hesta scold the device and watched the way it enjoyed being shouted at and then sulked if shouted at for too long, and told her that she must be careful not to become its mother. He made Bram hold the stabler and whistle to himself alone, and Bram forgot to be world-important for the duration and afterward looked embarrassed and rested. He made Tamsin open her hands, and the thread went bright and sulked and made a note in the air that meant, fine, our work is shared, if it must be. He did not try to teach Laleh anything because he was not foolish, but he let her observe the way the sigh did its work and the way a hiss looks for weather that can be blamed, and she wrote three neat lines across the top of a page and then folded it and would read them to nobody for a week.\n\nWhen the lesson had gone long enough to convince the tool that it had not been co-opted into a school, the kettle cried, and in that awkward opening between instruction and tea the letter in Mara\u2019s saucers fell over and showed its last sentence, which she had not noticed because she has wit enough to avoid endings when she can. The line said: Do not staple your grief to the day. Do not staple your dear to the corner where he once stood. He is gone into a place with no seams and will be angry if you teach that place tricks. She put her hand over it with a movement more protective than ashamed, and Bram saw and did the polite thing and looked away, and then did the impolite thing that constitutes friendship and put his hand over hers on the paper. The bone in the sink knocked its tooth against the metal of the stabler once, like a spoon telling a glass it had loved it very long and would prefer not to have to say so.\n\nDown at the Registry, the man with the separator sat in Hesta\u2019s circle and discovered what it feels like to be the seam in a story, and he learned to sneeze at his own device when it tried to teach his fingerprints to be less loyal. The sheep took earsful of iron\u2019s bedtime story and did not tell anyone because some kindnesses lie better in wool. The bell fence found a new note that meant we are not meant to hold this one, this wrong, this next thing that will come with more rhetoric and better shoes. The harbor chain dreamed of being a river and woke embarrassed. The chalk circles around children\u2019s feet smudged with play and the children remembered that chores are a species of magic if done with ridiculous seriousness. And the city, which had been stapled and unfastened and advised and chalked and scolded and fed and defended and asked to behave itself in more ornate ways than any object should have to endure, took a deep breath and let it out, with the sigh of a seam finding itself in a garment made of neighborhoods and thresholds and men who could be taught and women who had always known.\n\nNight was not done with them. It never is. Hesta came to the door of Mara\u2019s kitchen after the washing up and leaned as if she had been placed there by a stagehand in a competent play and said, with an expression that made even Tamsin sit up and place her thread down like a good knife, \u201cThey are unfastening marriages.\u201d She let the sentence sit long enough to learn to be heavy and then added the only amendment it needed. \u201cThey are doing it with words and with the hiss where words fail them. They are calling it mercy. They are calling it clean. People are thanking them in the way you thank someone on your step when your hands are still wet from the sink. I will need circles and thread and your metal, but mostly I will need the parts of you that look like the inside of your kitchen, because this is that kind of wrong.\u201d\n\nMara looked at the letter and took her hand away from it because if the day had taught her anything it was that hiding is overrated as a strategy. She took the stabler, which had been prepared for this conversation before she, the stubborn one, was, and the bone, which had an opinion about vows that had been made under weather, and the wool, which had gotten a little drunk on its new habit of being useful. Bram took his stick and knocked its end gently on the floor as if to remind it that it can be asked to be kind and to be sorry afterward, and Corwin gathered his pages because he keeps his courage in them and then pretends to have left it elsewhere when heroism would be flattering, and Tamsin tied her thread to a wrist she had never expected to see such work, and Laleh took the candle because people like candles when they intend to tell the truth to themselves in rooms they did not choose.\n\nThe first house had tea on the table because grief cannot resist the practical, and the husband stood in the doorway because he had rehearsed that posture for this speech and would not be robbed of it. The wife held a cup too hot and did not care and had that look of a woman who would prefer to be made to hate someone publicly rather than to be obliged to love them privately after he had left. The man with the hiss was not there; his cousin was, the idea he had brought to town walking in other shoes. It had no device and did not need one. It had sentences men had learned from books and excuses women had learned from their mothers and little bits of neon from the market that had gotten tangled in vows on the way home, throwing sparks. It had mercy in its hand; it was prepared to be thanked. Mara stepped over the threshold and made the wrong remember it was in a corner. She placed the stabler not on the ring of a finger nor on the laces of a shoe but on the patience in the room, the part of the air that holds the words like a basket when people are trying to tell the truth without showing off. She fastened patience to time and it made a little sound like a kiss given to a forehead because there was soup to be offered and a child in the next room who had to be convinced the world wasn\u2019t changing, only the furniture. \u201cSay it,\u201d she told the man, not unkindly. \u201cSay your needing. Do not call it clean. Do not call it mercy. Say the small, bad part first, the ridiculous part about how you cannot bear to see your own hair in the basin because it reminds you of how your father left everything undone and you learned to leave because it felt like agency. Then say the part about the woman you met in the counting house. Then tell her you do not know if you will be cruel or decent in a year. Then wait while she decides if the corner is where she still wants to live.\u201d\n\nThe wrong did not know where to stand in that protocol. It tried to hiss and failed and tried to stand taller and shrank and remembered that certain corners have heard babies cry and that makes them disinclined to be lectured by ideas. Tamsin tied red thread to the chair backs and to the tea pot because the act of pouring is older than most separations and teaches a hand to measure without thinking it\u2019s doing math. Bram put his stick under his arm and waited in the way of men who understand that waiting is sometimes shepherding, and Corwin looked at his pages and did not turn any, which is the most radical thing a man like him can do in a room. Hesta stood, and the house learned to brace itself without turning its boards into a wall. Laleh did not write because the room would have hated it. The wife drank the tea and set it down and said her small, bad thing first: about how she hated the way his boots sounded because it meant the day would begin before she had chosen a hat, and then said the name of the woman he had met, and then said, in the voice you forgive people anything for, \u201cI will not have you called clean. I will have you called kind, if I can manage it. I will have my corner. I will have my bell. I will have my breath. Go, then, but do not let the wrong call you by your new name.\u201d\n\nThey went to nine houses because three is polite and six is thorough and nine is the number you use when you intend to be tired and still be moral. They stapled patience to rooms and they unfastened old bindings that had been taught by vanity, and Mara used the bone on three marriages that had done the courageous thing earlier than either of the people in them had known how to name, and freed them, and later she cried in her kitchen until the dog put his nose on her knee and then she cried more because she remembered a nose she used to know. They told two men with devices to take their hissing out into a field where sheep would look at them until they changed their minds. They told one woman that if she ever, ever called a clean separation mercy in front of Tamsin again she would be tied to a post and made to listen to bells all afternoon until she cried from boredom. They drew circles around a bed and did not cross them because certain unfastenings should be done in private and not by neighbors, and Hesta stood guard outside and frightened away three gossips with the set of her shoulders.\n\nThey did not finish. You cannot. The city is a garment that fits badly even on its good days, and there are hems upon hems and somebody\u2019s grandmother sewed a line no one can cut without unmaking a story. They went home when the kettle sounded tired and the bell fence picked at its own tune out of boredom, and they sat in Mara\u2019s kitchen and ate bread without butter and that made Corwin announce he would bring butter next time, and Laleh wrote one line on a page and tore it off and burned it because it was too satisfying, and Hesta hung her chalk from a nail and told it to sleep, and Tamsin tied her thread to the back of a chair and asked it to dream true, and Bram put his stick across his knees the way a man lays a dog\u2019s head there and they rested together. The stabler lay on the towel and steamed a very little as if pleased, and the bone smiled because it had learned four new things about mercy and one about vanity, and the letter in the saucers pressed itself flat to the porcelain because it had told her its last useful line and wanted to be allowed to become a napkin for a morning with jam.\n\nWhen she finally slept, Mara dreamed of corners that had tidied themselves into plenitude instead of judgment, and of chalk lines that did not scold but reminded, and of bells that rang because they were tired of being quiet and not because anyone was in danger. In the dream, the sea put its hand on the harbor chain and patted it like a relative who has run out of interesting stories and has learned to listen, and sheep stood with their ears at a peculiar angle as if the iron were telling them a joke it had misremembered, and wolves lay on their backs in the chalk circles Angelo had drawn around them and confessed to the night that they were bored. She woke with the taste of lemons in her mouth, but the good kind, and went to the sink to find her tool exactly where it should be, and the sun in the window came through in a square, which, despite the fashion, pleased her.",

                              "content": "The apes came down on a Tuesday, beating shields that rang like pothole covers and clattering through the rust-laced gates as if sound could be a kind of weapon. People ducked, dogs bayed, and someone\u2019s laundry\u2014a string of shirts the same rust-red as the gates\u2014became the first wave\u2019s trophy. Nobody died; nobody ever did during those raids, not in our quarter. There was a method to it, Mara Quill thought as she peered through the split curtains of 49 Ingres Lane and saw the column pass. Every ape chose a shirt, but never two. Every ape paused at the same cracked paving stone and thumped it once with a knuckle as big as her notary stamp. Then they made right angles where alleys offered curves.\n\nShe took notes because she took notes about everything. When nothing was happening, she inventively found meaning in sprinklers and cookie sales and whether the new man in 57 was really a gardener or a soldier, and when something did happen, when armored apes trod laundry and shattered a jar of pickled cabbage in an artful arc like cherry blossoms, she became steady and sweet inside with alertness. She wrote on a recipe card because the notebook she kept for raids had walked off last week; she\u2019d probably lent it to someone who had insisted they would return it. People did say things.\n\n\u201cDear,\u201d she called over her shoulder, because it was a habit and because it comforted her to say it even if no one answered, \u201cplease see how they are touching that same crack. If that isn\u2019t weird, I need new definitions.\u201d\n\nNo one answered. There had been no \u201cdear\u201d for some time now, just the plant in the sink and the constant smell of binder clip metal and ink and an embarrassment of saucers because she kept finding them at yard sales and no one else seemed to want them. They hung like pale moons along the kitchen shelf, and there were too many to use in a lifetime. Her neighbors had opinions about that, as neighbors do.\n\nMara had other tools, too, tucked under the dishcloths: a bone-handled letter opener that might actually have been a knife, a small wooden device for pressing wax seals that she had only once used to press cinnamon into toast, and the thing that had altered her posture, her days, the way she saw her own hands.\n\nShe had called it\u2014because it came with no label and because the man who gave it to her had a cough that ended in \u201ceh, what?\u201d\u2014the infinate stabler, which was what he seemed to call it in the letter, all smudged and mad with pencil.\n\nThere are objects that you pick up and mistake for their cousins; you think a river pebble is a gumdrop. You think a long bone is a walking stick. This was a stapler in the way that a rake is a fork, a since-when tool. It had weight like a word you should not use and a grip that did not grip your palm so much as slide into your hand as if the hand had been made for it, not the other way around. Its jaw could open the span of a loaf pan, but its bite was delicate enough to kiss two curls of paper together and make them whole.\n\nIt made a sound when you used it: not click, not clack, but almost a sigh, like a seam finding itself. It did not run out of staples. Or if it did, the world did not live long enough to see that day. And if it were only a stapler, Mara would have used it to staple everything, which she did anyway: she stapled raffia to the fence when it came loose and stapled a peony\u2019s heavy head to a bamboo stick when the weather made it bow. She stapled a hem, and she stapled a cough, and she was only ashamed about one of those things. She pressed the jaw over her left thumbnail once and it made the smooth press of pressure and there was no pain and afterward, the nail shone like she had polished it with lemon.\n\n\u201cBut what are the apes stapling?\u201d she asked the empty room as the column marched past. The apes\u2019 tusked helmets had ancient scratches in them, stories arranged in parallel lines, and their cloaks looked like stitched pelts of something that had grown in a bramble. They were never dirty. They had ritual dirt, of course; they smeared it on their cheeks the way children touched dabs of paint. Their leader\u2014three leaders?\u2014raised a spear that was more a pointer than a weapon and jabbed it into air on each corner.\n\nHer neighbor, Bram from 73, said a spear is a sentence, and a shield is a book, but he said many things. He used to be a shepherd or so he said, in the hills beyond, where the apes came from if you believed the maps. Mara believed maps like she believed recipes: nice starting points until someone sensible improved them.\n\nShe scribbled: apes touch crack: not random; shirts not socks; no bread stolen; took yard glider last time (why? for what?). Underneath, in smaller letters, she wrote: talk to Bram.\n\nBy the time she got her coat\u2014there had been a cold that hung on like a person without a watch\u2014and stepped out, the apes had passed and the street was less a street and more a commentary on noise. Someone cried about the jar. Somebody else laughed because the jar had contained the worst pickled cabbage in a generation and the apes had done a community service. Mara paused at the cracked stone.\n\nIt was just a crack in a stone. It ran like a river on a map, and when she traced it with her finger, she felt a coolness, as if wind had been pressed there. She tried to lift the stone. The stone stayed. She took the infinate stabler from her coat pocket because this was that kind of day and because curiosity is a kind of oath and because she knew people were watching and she liked that a little more than she let on, and pressed the open jaw over the crack.\n\n\u201cJust to see,\u201d she said.\n\nThe stabler made its sigh, and the crack became a line. The line became nothing. The stone was whole, unbroken, as if freshly poured, as if someone had turned back the day before the day it cracked.\n\nA boy whistled. Bram, who had been in the doorway of 73 working a cigarette he never lit, stepped off his stoop as if he\u2019d been waiting for her. He had hair like a broom that had been used, then washed, then used again, and the narrow look of a person who spent time noticing shadows so he could step in or out of them at the right moment.\n\n\u201cI told you not to do that in public,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou told me to tie down the world if it flapped,\u201d Mara said, not lifting the stabler, keeping it in her hand because otherwise it seemed to disappear where she put it, which was a thing that freaked her out and did not freak her out, both.\n\n\u201cI said nothing like that,\u201d Bram said, \u201cbut let\u2019s pretend I did and that I am clever for it. That crack\u2014how long do you think it was there?\u201d\n\n\u201cSince the quake,\u201d she said, and when he made a face she added, \u201cor since before the quake. There\u2019s always a before.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome cracks you want. They tell you where not to step. Some news is kind in that way,\u201d he said, but his eyes were on the street, on the same path the apes had taken, on the spots where they\u2019d paused. He stepped to the nearest stoop and knocked with his knuckles; the old woman who lived there shook her head, already knowing, and pushed out a broom so he could sweep the spilled cabbage into a polite hill.\n\n\u201cAre you thrumming?\u201d Mara asked, which was code for Are you listening to something invisible?\n\n\u201cMm,\u201d Bram said. His ear had a sore spot where it pinched in and held onto the world. He crouched and touched the stone that had been cracked and pressed his palm flat to it. \u201cYou patched it. They\u2019ll either be disappointed or impressed.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey who?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem,\u201d Bram said, and then laughed at himself because he hated how he sounded when he said things like that. \u201cYou know. The apes. I don\u2019t think they like broken things. It throws them. They march on top of seams because they like to know where the seams are. See? It\u2019s a flock thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cA what thing,\u201d Mara said, even though she had heard him say that word before and had chosen to pretend he hadn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Bram said, and pinched the bridge of his nose as if the world had spilled too bright. He looked at her hand, at the weight of metal resting like a threat or a blessing in her palm. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get asked to do something with that. If not today, then tomorrow. I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t say yes without telling me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say yes to anything,\u201d Mara said, and then caught herself, because she had said yes to everything that ever knocked on her door.\n\nLater, after the street had returned to its usual business of being watched and being repaired and being watched being repaired, she went to Bram\u2019s because he brewed coffee in a pot you had to coax over the stove and it tasted like something dangerous and old. His room smelled like wet wool that had been allowed to sing, which made no sense when she told anybody else, so she didn\u2019t, not anymore. He had a rack of walking sticks that had the same notch carved into each, and photographs where the sky looked heavier than any sky she had seen.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll come again in three days,\u201d he said, laying out cups, and because Mara watched him like she watched everything, she noticed he always set an extra cup down and then thought better of it and put it back, like the person he hoped would come never did. \u201cAnd not here. They\u2019ll go to the ring market, to the clay arcades.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the spice sellers put their tables and the locksmith with the pretty son has the cart for his brass shapes,\u201d Mara said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have them taking keys. Everyone\u2019d be locked out. The locksmith would be drunk on business and then ashamed of being so happy about why.\u201d\n\nBram grunted. \u201cThey won\u2019t take keys. They don\u2019t like pockets. Keys go in pockets, and they are not, by nature, pocket people.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d Mara said, to see if he would argue with it.\n\nBram took his time. He carried the pot to the table and poured.\n\n\u201cYou know the trouble with obvious truths?\u201d he asked, settling. \u201cThey settle in you so deep you can\u2019t spit them out. Every child in this city can draw you an ape: the brow, the fists, the way they bend from the waist when they run. They can tell you how to scare one with a bell or a cunning cat. They can tell you how the first Legions came across the iron seam that runs from quarry to sea, and how they learned to stack their shields into steps. And they will have never in their lives watched one eat.\u201d\n\nMara stirred her coffee, which needed no stirring; it didn\u2019t need milk, either, but she liked the swirl.\n\n\u201cAre you about to talk about grass?\u201d she asked.\n\nBram\u2019s mouth twitched. \u201cI am about to talk about mouths. About teeth. Did you see the leader\u2019s smile today? Did you see the shape of his pupils?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see me looking directly into the mouth of the leader of the apes? I prefer to keep the parts of me that are arranged as they are arranged,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, Bram. Why don\u2019t you tell me about pupils.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t round,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were\u2014then again, I forget where you grew up. Maybe you didn\u2019t have the hills. Maybe you never went out when the fog lifts and the ewes are calling their lambs in the gullies and the sky is eating the last of the night. Maybe you never looked an animal in the eye and learned what it was by the shape of the light it let in. Rectangles. Did you know? Like doors.\u201d\n\nHe looked, for a second, like the boy he had once been. It came like light off a puddle, quickly gone. \u201cAnyway. Keys are useless to them. Locks are already open. They don\u2019t come for things. They come for corners.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are we supposed to do,\u201d Mara asked, \u201cif they take the corners? Our houses will roll away. All the tables will be round.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t smile as much as he surrendered to the idea of smiling, and then the smile left him like a rumor leaves a room.\n\n\u201cAre you going to ask me why I have so many sticks?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, which made him lift his eyebrows.\n\nShe had asked him two dozen times already; this was their game. And he had never answered in a straight line. Today, he said, \u201cYou carry a tool like a flag. You can either wave it or you can pretend it is a weather vane and hope the wind is patient with your pretense. People will come to you, Mara. People who say words like duty and humanity and curtain. People who whisper in their shirts. People who are sure. It\u2019s a kind of hunger, certainty is. You should eat before they knock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI already did,\u201d she said, and then because he was right and because the infinate stabler had a way of making a day feel like a thing with edges, she ate again.\n\nThe knock came before the third day, because of course it did. You put a peculiar thing near a window and the city smells it. She had been rearranging the saucers into a pattern she was sure meant something\u2014moon, moon, sea, egg, egg\u2014and she left them half-made on the table and went to the door with the stabler in her pocket and her hair like she had been living.\n\nThe man on the stoop wore a uniform that was the opposite of the apes\u2019: it made his edges softer. He had his papers in order and a smile like a physician or a salesman.\n\n\u201cMs. Quill,\u201d he said, \u201cMara, may I be \u2018Mara\u2019? It\u2019s so much friendlier. I\u2019m Corwin with the Council. You have something the city would like to borrow. Temporarily. For the good of\u2014oh. Is that coffee?\u201d\n\nShe did not move aside. \u201cI\u2019ll put the kettle on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do love a kettle,\u201d he said, stepping in because people like him are made to step in. \u201cMy mother kept the kettle singing like a bird and the house was never\u2014well. Do you mind if I set this folder here.\u201d\n\nHe had the folder. Of course he had the folder. Inside were her notes, the careless ones, the ones she\u2019d given to Laleh at the paper because Laleh had a laugh like a trap door and Mara liked to feed it. There were pictures of her fence with the raffia neatly stapled, and of the light in her left window like she forgot sometimes to turn it off. Her life rendered in reasonable arguments why she should cooperate.\n\n\u201cYou have something,\u201d he said again when the kettle had not boiled because he had lost track of his time and had forgotten who boiled what. \u201cIt\u2019d be a kindness. Only for a few hours. The ring market\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days,\u201d Mara said.\n\n\u201cBeg pardon?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll go to the ring market in three days. That\u2019s where you want my help. Bram says keys are safe. Corners aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cCorners,\u201d Corwin said, as if it were a code and as if he was translating it in his mouth. \u201cWe had a mathematician say something like that. She drew a square on the chalkboard and then erased all of it except one angle, and we all stood there like crows look at mirrors. We\u2019ve been recommending circles where possible, but people like corners. We\u2019re trying to change the fashion.\u201d\n\nMara poured coffee and watched him be good at drinking it. He was a man who could pretend anything was pleasant, and sometimes that is more dangerous than delirium.\n\n\u201cWhat does the Council want me to do,\u201d she asked, although her hand had already gone to the stabler in her pocket and found it too warm, like a small sleeping thing.\n\n\u201cYou have a tool that might bind one thing to another. Strongly. Efficiently. If we can keep them from opening our corners, we can keep their columns outside. For a time. I know time is a small piece of bread and everyone wants a bite, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m offering you. A bite.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor what,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat are they after. Besides corners.\u201d\n\nCorwin touched the folder and said nothing for an elegant length of time. \u201cStability,\u201d he said finally, which was not the same as saying corners. \u201cYou see, and please don\u2019t repeat this to the man with the sticks, because he is allergic to words like mine, we suspect the raids are rehearsals. Not for war. For settlement. They don\u2019t burn. They don\u2019t\u2014pardon\u2014rape. They make measurements. They leave a thin wool on our lintels, sometimes, have you noticed, and our dogs sneeze for an hour. Our bakers say the bread comes out heavier the day after they pass. Our barbers say everybody comes in and wants their hair shorter like they are preparing to wear helmets. It\u2019s a kind of survey. We think, if they think these houses are already theirs in some future we can almost see, they\u2019ll be less likely to break them now. To keep the place tidy for themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the Council,\u201d Mara said, \u201cwould prefer they feel the opposite.\u201d\n\nCorwin smiled, and the smile took all the easy out of his face. \u201cI would prefer you to act as if you also live here. I hear you\u2019re a very good neighbor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been asking my neighbors about me,\u201d she said, flat.\n\nHe folded his hands. \u201cBram says you are a busybody. This is not a bad word where I come from. My mother kept a list of births and deaths on the door and would go knock an hour after the knockers left with pies and envelopes and the names of good plumbers. We call that civic, where I come from. You have the tool, Ms. Quill. I\u2019m here to make sure you get to use it for what it\u2019s for.\u201d\n\nShe wanted to ask: for what is it for? But the stabler thrummed in her pocket as if it could hear and as if it did not like being referred to in the general, like a woman being told she was a category. \u201cThree days,\u201d she said again, because it made the word feel round and she needed something round to hold.\n\nThey met where the clay arcades met the ring road. There were pots stacked in crescents and cinnamon knotted into sticks and a wind pulled long over the ground so the canvas tents flapped and the school kids ducked and came back up as if the day had winked. Mara wore a jacket with too many pockets. Bram carried a stick today, though he always had a stick; this one had a strip of cloth tied near the head, and if you squinted the cloth might have been a flag. Corwin had a pen in his shirt like a promise. The locksmith\u2019s pretty son had his sleeves rolled up and grease on his knuckles and he winked for no reason at all except that he was young and the day seemed like a thing that could be placed in a pocket and brought out later, still warm.\n\nThe apes came as Corwin said they would not: they had no plan to be late and were. People hate their predictions to be wrong when they are official about it. Mara watched him swallow the error and make a different one with his second mouth. She felt the crowd collect around edges they couldn\u2019t help making\u2014corners at tent meets, corners at the base of a pillar where someone had left a broom, corners where two faces came together with a laugh and a hand tugged another hand into a shadow.\n\nThey came with their shields and their drums and the sound of bellows in a forge that someone had put under the earth. They came with tasseled blades that never cut and the self-same solemnity they wore in the laundries. They came. And then they stalled.\n\nThey stalled because Mara stepped forward, which was not the plan because there had never been a plan and she had told herself there should be one and then told herself the telling was a plan and had, in a small way, believed it. She put the infinate stabler like a carpenters\u2019 truth out in front of her and opened the jaw and explained, with no words, that if anyone opened something today that shouldn\u2019t be opened, they would close it. She felt the click no one else heard. She felt the crowd back up into a softer shape behind her, as if the street had become a set of lungs and someone had told it a joke.\n\nThe leader\u2014leaders\u2014came forward. Today there were two, or one and a mirror. The left one touched the ground with his spear and tapped out a pattern: tap, tap, nothing, tap. The right one hummed.\n\nMara said, \u201cI\u2019m Mara Quill,\u201d which was not particularly useful, and then because she spoke fluent human she added, \u201cIf you touch our corners I will staple them back on.\u201d\n\nThe left leader\u2019s shoulders moved. It might have been laughter. It might have been breath. The right leader looked at her hand, not at her face, and then leaned his body\u2014there were a lot of bodies. It\u2019s easy to say \u201can ape\u201d and imagine one thing. It\u2019s better to say: a shoulder with a scar shaped like a piece of a moon, two knees that had grazed stone for reasons unknown, a wrist wrapped in red thread, a mouth that did not sit right because a tooth had grown in late and sideways. He leaned, and Mara saw it. It was quick, like a bird. A flick of tongue? No. A catch of light on a ring in the nose? Also no. It was his eye, and no one saw it, not even Bram who sees too much because he looked at something else right then (the hand of a child, maybe, because always he could find the child\u2019s hand in the crowd)\u2014and Mara saw the slit of the pupil and it was not a slit at all. It was a door. A rectangle that widened as the world brightened, a field\u2019s view, a gate.\n\nShe laughed, not kindly. She couldn\u2019t help it. It came out like a bark.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been eating grass,\u201d she said, and Corwin hissed and Bram said her name and the leaders heard something in her voice that we didn\u2019t. They shifted. The one with the scar put his hand on his chest the way a man swears a thing. He did not speak words, or not in the way we make them. He bleated.\n\nNo one laughed but her and a baby and a dog.\n\nHere is where stories fork. You tell the one where the village roars and the apes roar back and then there is a great rectifiable confusion. Or you tell the one where the woman with the odd tool blows it like a whistle and they all stop and take tea. Or you tell the one no one believes, where two truths show up at the same party in the same dress and you realize how little you know about the shape of a mouth or the meaning of a noise.\n\nBram stepped forward with his stick and put it down and then picked it up again, and that was some shepherd\u2019s signal from an old, old country where the hills made their own weather and the sheep made their own bargains. The leaders turned their heads in the same way, like a flock does when a dog pivots, the same enclosed elegance. Their shoulders moved again. The right one bleated back, to test what language could do between humans and not-humans and something worse. The crowd\u2019s patience stretched like warm candy. Corwin said \u201cNow, now\u2014,\u201d and sound had never sounded less like meaning.\n\nMara lifted the stabler. \u201cYou think we don\u2019t see you,\u201d she said. She was shaking and she would not admit it even later. \u201cFine. Maybe we see you too much. Maybe we\u2019ve been drawing the wrong pictures for the right myths. You like corners because corners keep the wind off. You like corners because corners keep you from being seen from all sides. You like corners because we live in them, because we are the sort of beasts that find a corner and claim it. But you\u2019re not apes. You\u2019re not, are you. Show me.\u201d\n\nShe closed the jaw gently around the rim of the world and pressed. It was a trick she had learned with the peonies, when she\u2019d been brave with flowers. You can bite a stem and hold up a drowned blossom and make it look like it is proud. You can press a hem and it won\u2019t fray. You can, if you are patient, staple a lie to a lie and make a whole cloth.\n\nThe stabler sighed. The canvas tents stopped flapping though the wind still was. The dust froze mid-billow. The leader\u2019s helmet did not fall because gravity did not need that kind of service from her; it tilted and the strap popped and there was wool where a throat should have been, thick and clean and smelling of lanolin and rain. It bristled. It had burrs, small ones, as if someone had walked through a story that had grown in a hedgerow.\n\nThere was no blood. There was no reveal like a melodrama. There was the thing that happens when your eyes decide they will stop lying to you right now, and all the tricks you taught to your mind\u2014don\u2019t look, don\u2019t see, don\u2019t think\u2014get tired and sit down.\n\nThe crowd did not scream because it had never been taught how to make that sound. The apes\u2014sheep, not apes\u2014bleated, but it was not fear and it was not joy; it was a checking-in, like the sound people make at a table when a stranger sits down and takes off their hat and is not a stranger. The leader\u2014the leaders\u2014reached up and took the helmet entirely away.\n\n\u201cGood heavens,\u201d Corwin said, and then covered his mouth because good heavens was a very funny thing to say at such a moment and he did not intend to be someone\u2019s joke.\n\nBram\u2019s stick drooped and then lifted. He looked not surprised, which told Mara he knew and also that he had not wanted to know in the way that counts.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been walking them like men,\u201d she said to him, not exactly kindly and not exactly unkind.\n\n\u201cWe all have,\u201d he said and did not make a poem of it.\n\nThe leader put a hoof on the spear, which was very much a stick now that you looked at it. The hoof was cloven. The straps that had held armor to wool looked like someone had practiced a lot of knots. Mara wanted to tidy them and did not. The leader\u2019s eye\u2014that gate\u2014looked at her, and she looked back, and the stabler was heavy in her hand, as if it had eaten something rich.\n\nHe bleated. He bleated again, and the second time it was almost words, not hers, not Bram\u2019s, not any that Laleh could print and feel right about, but something like obligation. It reminded her of the way Corwin had said duty, like it was a cake he liked but knew he should not have every day.\n\n\u201cAre you trying to tell me you came to save us,\u201d Mara asked, and her voice wanted to be a whisper but it refused. \u201cBecause I am going to be a very difficult person about that.\u201d\n\nThe leader looked down at the crack in the stone that wasn\u2019t there anymore because she had fixed it with her foolishness and then back up at her. He bleated a little differently. He lowered his head, not to butt, but to show the crown of it, the way a sheep will when it acknowledges a dog, when it negotiates in that old mathematics.\n\nBram coughed his laugh. \u201cThey came to measure us. Herds measure, you know. That\u2019s what they do. It\u2019s not as martial as you love, Corwin. It\u2019s not a war at all; that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been so bad at it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBad,\u201d Mara said softly, not because she thought the sheep couldn\u2019t hear and not because she thought it\u2019d be gentle. \u201cBad at war and good at\u2014what? Counting? Caring?\u201d\n\n\u201cKeeping,\u201d Bram said, and then shook his head because he spoke too much when the air got thin. \u201cThey\u2019ll want to know if we\u2019re going to wander. They\u2019ll want fences without saying fences. They\u2019ll want\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cStability,\u201d Corwin said, as if he\u2019d gotten it right after all, and maybe he had, and maybe his mother\u2019s kettle had been singing this whole time and he had never heard the tune. \u201cThey want us in a pen. The city as a pen. The way that makes it sound worse than it is.\u201d\n\nMara held the infinate stabler and looked at the sheep in armor and at the people pressed into shapes behind her and at Bram\u2019s stick and Corwin\u2019s pen and the locksmith\u2019s pretty son scrubbing his knuckles like he could polish the day away to reveal something brighter. She did not speak for nine heartbeats. That\u2019s a long time in a ring market when everyone has things to sell and everyone has things to buy and a rumor has a travel plan. It was long enough for her to find the edges of a thought and press them together and feel the sigh of a seam finding itself.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d she said, to the leaders who were not men and to the people who were and to herself, who had been both at times. \u201cIf you came to keep us, you have to do it by our terms. You have to let us keep the parts of us that leave. In return I\u2019ll make you a bargain. You stop touching our corners, and I keep the ones we have. Not for you. For us. But you can\u2014\u201d she looked at Bram because sometimes you need someone to tell you if you\u2019re talking sense or carving nonsense into the table with your knife\u2014\u201cyou can\u2026 watch. From the hill. And you can tell us when the sky is wrong. And when wolves come, which they always do, you come, but you don\u2019t take the lambs; you take the wolf. Do you see? Do you even see me.\u201d\n\nShe did not know if the leader saw her. He bleated. He nodded. It looked like a nod. His wool shook because the wind remembered it existed and returned to do its work, and the canvas struck its ropes with the old interest of a drum seeking a song. Someone began to cry. Someone began to laugh. People do both when the world goes sideways and then insists that it was never upright in the first place.\n\nCorwin exhaled. \u201cYou can\u2019t make treaties,\u201d he said, not unkind. \u201cI mean, you can\u2019t, you personally. I can\u2019t explain the law. It requires \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cRequire me later,\u201d Mara said. \u201cToday I\u2019m stapling.\u201d She turned and put the infinate stabler, carefully, deliberately, on one of the market\u2019s corners: post to rug, rug to road. The sigh when the jaw closed went through the crowd like a kiss pressed to a forehead. She moved to another corner and pressed again. People watched. They began to bring her corners. They offered the mistakes they had made with their tents and with their thresholds and with their lives. Men who had been angry an hour ago became helpful. A girl who had been bored became a champion of edges. When she stapled a fence in a way it had always wanted to be, the sheep leader bleated and another sheep bleated and the sound was not war and it was not an ending. It was maybe a beginning; she would not say it, but she felt the way the ground approved.\n\nIt is very hard to defend a city with a tool borrowed from an office. It is very hard to be the kind of person who knocks on everybody\u2019s door and tells them their potted plant needs turning and then to be someone who lifts a device and says, I\u2019m going to hold you together now, whether you agree or not, because the wind is playing tricks. It is hard, and Mara was not particularly good at it, not at first. But she was stubborn, and she catalogued, and she learned that a corner is the memory of a turn, which is why it hurts to see one battered. She learned where to press and where to hold off. She learned that some seams should be left open because a city needs to breathe like a boy.\n\nBy late, the apes-who-were-sheep had taken their helmets back and the dog that had laughed lay down in a stripe of light and fell asleep. Bram leaned his stick in the crook of his arm and said, \u201cYou know this isn\u2019t over.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing is over,\u201d Mara said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem.\u201d\n\nHe looked at her the way he looked sometimes, like he had known her far too long and not long enough. \u201cI should have told you earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cI should have told you when you showed me that thing and it bit your thumb that day and you swore. I should have said: they\u2019re sheep. You\u2019d have laughed before the right time and then, today, you\u2019d have cried before the wrong. But I thought if I didn\u2019t say it out loud, it might not be true in the way that matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there a way that matters?\u201d she asked.\n\nHe did not answer. Corwin did.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way we write it down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not writing this one down,\u201d Mara said, and there was enough tired in her voice to lay bricks.\n\nCorwin smiled his second smile. \u201cThat\u2019s what everybody says, the first time.\u201d\n\nShe walked home with the infinate stabler long against her forearm like a sleeping cat. The street had changed. It had more corners than it had had that morning. Some were small, the kind you could tuck a secret in. Some were new and bright and looked like they would hurt if you ran into them too fast. She saw where she had missed a place and where someone had seen and patched it with string and hope. She saw Bram on his stoop and felt the ache of future nights when he wouldn\u2019t be there and how the sticks would lean in the empty hallway as if they knew something about weather and absence. The sky had a wrong in it she could not name; it looked too close to the roofs or maybe the roofs had grown taller when nobody was watching.\n\nWhen she went in, the saucers were still on the table in their almost-pattern, and she let them stay like that because they had their own opinion about arrangement. She put the stabler in the sink because it was the only place in her house that anything heavy sat and looked at all right and because it was where you put things you did not yet have words for. It made a sound when the porcelain kissed metal. It sounded like yes and like stop and like the last thing somebody says before the important thing they cannot say.\n\nShe did not sleep. She tried. The city turned in its bed. She listened to Bram\u2019s cough and to the dogs and to the late step of a boy and to the quiet between three and four that belonged to no particular breed of creature. She thought about eyes like doors. She thought about the way the leader had dipped his head. She thought about Corwin, who was a man made of folders, and about Laleh, who had two pens in her hair and always wrote her name across a page before she wrote anything else on it, as if staking it. She thought about all the corners she had tightened today and the ones that would spring when the day warmed, because that was the way of things, that they tried to become themselves when you held them, and some of them succeeded.\n\nWhen morning took its breath, she got up and went to the market before anyone else. She walked the perimeter. The sheep had left a strand of wool on one of the posts, and she lifted it and twisted it the way she had once twisted a curl when a girl and liked herself. It smelled like weather. She put it in her pocket.\n\nAt the cracked stone she had fixed\u2014which was not cracked anymore because she had made it not crack but which remembered itself anyway when you stepped just right\u2014she paused, as the apes had done, and thumped it with her knuckle. It made the noise a pot makes when it expects soup soon. She decided she would make soup.\n\nOn the second day after she had pulled a helmet off a sheep and said aloud something no one wanted to put their mouths around, Corwin came back, and Laleh came to make the story behave, and Bram did not come because he was watching a sky on a hill and listening to a gap in the wind you only heard if you\u2019d been taught by lambs. The Council would want to enlist her. People would bring her things to fix, beyond corners, to make them stay or not\u2014wounds, promises, a marriage, a road. There were wolves, after all. There are always wolves. And there were sheep who were not what they wore, and people who had never been anything other than what they claimed, and a tool in a sink that could fasten a day to a day and make it hold.\n\nShe did not want to be the kind of person who walked into rooms and made lines with her hands. She had wanted small things: to have a cup ready when someone came in, to know when the rain would stall, to know who in the building was happy and who was not. She had wanted, at most, to be the woman with saucers who knows where all the saucers in a building are. And yet the world had called on her to staple it, to keep it together, to hold on. Someone had to. The city was too proud to ask, but it had asked anyway when it let the apes enter and didn\u2019t bar the gates with anything but custom and convenience.\n\n\u201cIt was always you,\u201d Bram had told her once, when he\u2019d had just enough to drink to allow himself an unlovely truth. He had said it like he was telling her where her lost glove had gone. She had pretended not to hear. She heard now, in the wake of bleats and sighs and helmet straps. It tasted like pennies. It tasted better as it sat.\n\nWhen Laleh came she looked at the stabler and made her face neutral and wrote down the thing without writing it down at all. \u201cSo,\u201d she said, \u201cthe apes are sheep.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt turns,\u201d Mara said, \u201cthat everything is a sentence you are still reading, and this is the clause where we turn the page.\u201d She hated herself a little for the drama. Laleh wrote it down anyway and added an exclamation point in her head and then crossed it out in the same head because she was disciplined.\n\nCorwin brought the folder. He put it on the table like a gift he was uncertain was appropriate. \u201cI need you to understand,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we say it, once we write it, it\u2019s true in the way that matters. People will make habits out of it. They\u2019ll bring them flower crowns. They\u2019ll break their shields for combs. They\u2019ll forget the part where wolves have teeth. They\u2019ll forget the part where sheep have teeth, too.\u201d\n\nMara picked up the wool from her pocket and pulled it to a longer thread until it snapped. She felt the energy in the break. She thought of the way the stabler sighed. She thought of how the leaders\u2019 pupils had opened like doors and the way the city had not decided yet whether to be flattered or afraid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to protect us from a truth,\u201d she said softly. \u201cI might try to staple it down so it doesn\u2019t blow away.\u201d\n\nCorwin sat. Laleh stood. Somewhere, Bram whistled and a line of creatures changed direction.\n\nMara placed the strand of wool on the table and made two ends meet. She lifted the infinate stabler and pressed its jaw open and set it around the meeting place with a familiar care. She hesitated and then she pressed.\n\nThe sigh made the saucers hum. The seam held. The air steadied. The day decided to be a day again. And in the hills, in a place where no one had told anyone what to call it, a flock lifted its heads and then went on chewing.",

                              "content": "By afternoon the newspaper had found a way to say what it could not say without looking foolish, which is the great work of newspapers. Laleh\u2019s headline did not announce anything so much as blink at the reader and dare them to finish the sentence for themselves: Helmets and Wool: What We Learned at the Ring last Marketday. The picture showed a line of shields and a canvas tent behaving and the corner of a hoof as if a horse had wandered into frame, which of course none had. The piece named no names but everybody wrote the names in anyway: that\u2019s Mara Quill, that\u2019s Bram with one of his batons, that\u2019s Corwin frowning like he is trying not to frown. Neighbors stopped in the bakery to pinch the paper between fingers still sugar-dusted and permit themselves opinions that had been waiting all their lives for a subject. \u201cThey were always sheep,\u201d one said with authority not available until this instant, and, \u201cNonsense, I have seen an ape\u2019s hand in my dreams,\u201d said another, and between those two statements the city made itself busy the way people arrange chairs at a kitchen table to make a hard conversation friendlier, and just as likely to curdle into something louder.\n\nMara had not intended to read it, but of course she did, re-folding the page after as if nothing had been unfolded, like an apology made to a napkin. She stood at the sink and let the sink run and then remembered she had a gift for missing what was right in front of her. The infinate stabler sat at the bottom of the basin like a fish that had decided to be still in a shallow pool. The water threaded itself around it and did not rise. It should have. It did not. The tap ran sound and air, a thin hiss that made her teeth think of wool. She shut it off and touched the stabler with two fingers as if feeling for a pulse on a throat. It was warm without being hot and dry without being dry in the normal way; it was the dryness of a page that has been licked by a person who thinks this will make the pen behave better.\n\nPeople began coming without asking permission, which meant they knocked first and then knocked again while their faces were already inside, a choreography she had trained herself to enjoy and secretly despise. A woman from the fifth floor with the baby that had laughed at the market came with a basket that contained no baby, only bills and envelopes and a braid of garlic as if vampires had been invited and were late. \u201cCan you fasten this,\u201d she asked, and Mara knew she did not mean the garlic, which had its own talent for binding scents to days. \u201cHe says he\u2019ll stop spending on marmalade we don\u2019t like. He says it\u2019s a small thing and that\u2019s the smallness of it that makes it sweet. He says a lot of things. Could you make one of them true.\u201d\n\nMara motioned to the table, to the pattern of saucers she had finally surrendered to, and the woman sat and put the basket down as if fiction were being made. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work like that,\u201d Mara said. \u201cIt barely works at all. It works on seams that already know they are seams. It doesn\u2019t make a seam where no seam belongs. It does not\u2014\u201d she looked at the garlic, which had its own opinions\u2014\u201cit does not trick husbands into sense.\u201d\n\nThe woman made a noise like she knew that and had hoped to forget it long enough to have someone else tell her. She left the bills and the garlic anyway because being seen leaving something behind in Mara\u2019s kitchen was a kind of act that could be referred to later and comfort the right set of nerves at three in the morning. After, a boy came with a kite that needed to be more sky than string and a teacher came with a stack of essays that needed to be more argument than display and a man came with a watch that had lost its afternoons. Mara did what she could for the kite and told the teacher that she could only staple ideas if the girls writing them wanted to be held to their words\u2014not all of them did, some were practicing how to slip\u2014and for the man she had nothing but a cup of coffee and two kinds of silence. She felt wicked saying no. The city had appointed her\u2014it had not; it had only glanced at her with the particular light that means now, now\u2014and she had said yes to everything that could be made into a list. She reminded herself that staples are not prayers. They are just a way of asking two edges to be courteous.\n\nCorwin arrived with his suit like a weather system, bringing the smell of ink and shoe polish and that sweet blue thread all paperwork carries even when the papers are blank. He put the folder on her table and took his time because men like him live longer in the space they occupy when they are inconveniencing someone they imagine they can persuade. He did not look at the saucers. He had trained himself not to look at a person\u2019s small peculiarities the way you train a dog not to stare at the meat you are saving for later. \u201cWe opened a conversation,\u201d he said, making \u201cwe\u201d do the work of \u201cI did not get shouted at for this and would like to continue not getting shouted at,\u201d and Mara poured water for him and made a face for him to ignore.\n\n\u201cThere are wolves,\u201d he said, only after biscuits and the kind of talk that passes for immediate between people who pretended yesterday did not happen. \u201cBram is gone; he left me a note that smelled like grass and told me he would be where grass listens. The shepherds\u2014they have shepherds in the hills, did you know, not just men like Bram who stand alone with their sticks in a city street and scare children into better posture\u2014they sent word that path-wolves have been seen on the iron seam.\u201d\n\nMara didn\u2019t know about path-wolves because no one had told her, which was astonishing because she was certain she had been told everything worth knowing since the day she learned to go down stairs with her cup and not spill a drop. \u201cPath-wolves,\u201d she said, tasting it. \u201cLike wolves, but with paths,\u201d she said, because her brain did better when it could goad her mouth into helping, and Corwin made a rectangle in the air with his fingers and tapped the corners, an unconscious little prayer he did now without knowing it.\n\n\u201cLike wolves who do not need mouths,\u201d he said. \u201cLike wolves that choose the easy way down a hill and then choose it again and then make the earth decide for itself that this is the way always, and then everything that walks must walk in that groove or risk falling. They dig with time, Mara. They make paths that are ruts and then roads and then habits. We had them once, anyone with a grandmother will tell you. They took the alley behind a house until the alley was the only way to the house, and then the house was the alley. We paved them out, or we thought we did, but the quarries have been busy, and the seam is exposed, and the wolves have teeth like repetition.\u201d\n\nShe thought of the apes-that-weren\u2019t, their rectangular eyes, their love of corners not for owning but for managing, for taking attendance. She thought of Bram with a stick on a hill whistling at a sky. She thought of her tool, which did not make wolves or cure them, but might stop a corner from forgetting itself in the face of a groove\u2019s nagging. \u201cYou want me to\u2014what. Staple roads to their place,\u201d she said. \u201cStaple habits to a set of manners. Staple path to path so it cannot widen into a will.\u201d\n\nHe gestured with his pen and almost laughed. \u201cI want you to come see. At least come see. You and Bram love to see. You can leave the tool at home if you think it will sulk in company.\u201d\n\nThe seam ran raw as a vein from the quarry all the way down to where the sea ate any promise you gave it out of courtesy. It sparkled where the sun found it, a glitter that made children point and then stop pointing because you tell your hands not to be rude in public and sometimes they listen. The first time she walked along it as a girl\u2014there had been a picnic, and a different man called dear then, and her saucers had an actual service to be part of\u2014she slid one foot along the iron to feel the world hum and was scolded into hand-holding and caution. Now, with Corwin and his pen and a woman from Public Safety who had the posture of someone who had slept in her clothes and liked it, Mara stood and saw how the path-wolves had begun their work. You cannot see a wolf until it has decided to show itself, but you can see where it is going to be later. There were lines in the dirt where there should have been scatter. There were lines in the grass where there should have been scuffle. The seam had a run, like a stocking. It was beautiful if you decided having your choices narrowed was beautiful.\n\nBram stood a little way up and lifted his stick, not as greeting but as proof that he had brought to the hill the one thing on earth that confessed honestly to being a tool. He was not alone. The shepherds were nothing like their stories; the stories made them humble and taciturn and dusty and carrying lambs over their shoulders without complaint. The people on the hill were chatty and well-shod and had knives for cutting bread that had never seen a sheep\u2019s wool in their lives. They had dogs whose eyes were triangles of intent and whose bodies were made entirely of the knowledge that they were right when they moved left. They kept their hats tight, because wind. They had wrists wrapped in red threads and scars in parallel lines that made Mara\u2019s hands feel like paper.\n\n\u201cPath-wolves,\u201d one said, not to Corwin but to the woman from Public Safety because he had recognized her as a person who knew how to have a plan and had perhaps never met one of those in the hills. \u201cThey like a seam. They like it because it is already a decision. All they have to do is make the decision tire itself out so we accept it. You get one cart wheel after another and before you can say, who tied this knot, you have a groove that knows your grandmother\u2019s name.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could pave,\u201d the woman said, staring, because it is the first response of an urban mind when a wild thing begins to make art.\n\n\u201cWe could pave,\u201d Bram said, from his place, \u201cand that would be a path-wolf\u2019s favorite. Paving is a kind of worship for them. It is the final confession. \u2018We will always be this way here,\u2019 the street says. Then it can sit and wait for hooves.\u201d\n\nMara crouched and pressed her fingers along the iron seam, finding where the earth gave and where it resisted with personality. The stabler in her bag shifted, an animal waking. She had promised herself she would leave it home and had not fulfilled that promise; people do that when they are very sure of themselves. \u201cWe could stitch,\u201d she said without meaning to speak out loud. Bram heard her across too much air because that\u2019s what being alive with a person looks like, sometimes; they hear your mouth before your mouth hears it. He glanced down.\n\n\u201cYou could stitch,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could make the corner a place that resists forgetting. You could make it say \u2018I am a turn\u2019 and not \u2018I am an invitation to a straight line.\u2019 Does your tool like that.\u201d\n\nMara put the bag down and took the thing out and held it in a way that made the shepherds stop looking at her face and start looking at the mouth of metal the way you look at a dog\u2019s mouth, calculating for kindness. There are ways to show strangers that you mean well without teaching them your whole biography. She pressed her hand along the jaw the way she had pressed it along the iron and listened to the almost-sigh it gave before the sigh it would have given. \u201cIt likes being asked,\u201d she said. \u201cIt does not like being told. It refuses the work if I speak to it as if I had purchased it. The man who gave it to me coughed the way secrets cough and did not tell me where it came from but the word he wrote looked like \u2018stabler,\u2019 not because of staples but because of stables, I think. I think someone meant for it to keep things.\u201d\n\n\u201cStabler,\u201d Bram said, and his mouth tasted the word like salt. \u201cYes. The old word in the hills for a person who keeps sheep at night is not \u2018shepherd,\u2019 it is \u2018night-stabler.\u2019 Not a stable at all, of course, but the person who makes the flock decide to behave like a flock when the dark has other ideas. You put the nights together until the dawn can handle it.\u201d\n\nCorwin wrote that down without meaning to, as if the pen had its own flocking instinct. The Public Safety woman took a step closer to the seam. \u201cPave and stitch and fence,\u201d she said, trialing the words like she could hold one in her hand and discover its temperature. \u201cI can budget for fence. The city likes a fence so much it tends to forget what it is for. People will paint it and call it their friend. Will you show me what stitching looks like before we spend money we will be ashamed we spent.\u201d\n\nThe seam had a place where it kinked up as if a knee had pushed under it in a dream. Mara set the jaws there and did not close them. She waited the way you wait a kettle, pretending not to stand over it. The tool softened her palm with its warmth. She remembered stapling the peony to its stick and the way it had sagged because some things prefer bowing to being righted. \u201cThis is a bad idea,\u201d she said to Bram, to test what an echo would do.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be worse when it works,\u201d he said, very gently.\n\nShe closed the jaw. The sigh went out and came back to her like wind through a window you have cleaned too well, and the seam did not lie down so much as remember lying down was possible. The iron didn\u2019t melt; it never does what you ask when you are theatrical. The earth around it bound itself to the idea of itself at that spot. Grass that had been thinking about a career in line-making decided, for today, to be patches and not a path. A dog lay down and stretched and let its paws be paws and not direction. Mara pulled back and breathed for herself and not the city.\n\nThe shepherds made a noise like approval that had been taught not to trust itself. Corwin exhaled in relief in the way a man does when he has successfully placed someone in the correct chapter in his binder. The woman from Public Safety was already calculating how many lengths of fence made sense if you were going to keep wolves from pretending to be roads. Bram leaned on his stick and looked away because when something is good you sometimes have to practice not looking for a moment so you will be better at looking later.\n\nMara sat on the grass because knees. The world had a tilt to it when she lowered, like a plate on a table someone had kicked. The tool in her hand had its weight and its appetite and she felt, as she always did after she let it kiss the edges of a thing, that somewhere a seam had closed that should not have and she would be embarrassed by that later when she found it. She made a list in her head of the corners that needed auditing by afternoon. She wished she could staple time to something and then immediately knew better than to wish out loud.\n\nThey put up a fence where the seam met the easy road, not a prison fence, though of course a fence is always a cousin to a prison; they strung it with bells the shepherds brought that had belonged to nobody and everyone. The bells were not loud. They were the sort of bells you hear only when you are already thinking about bells. That kind are the most useful; they remind the world of itself. Mara touched them and they quieted. Her tool did not like metal on metal. It sulked. She petted it. Bram watched as if someone had placed his heart on the ground and then stacked walnuts around it very carefully.\n\nOn the way down the hill she found him walking beside and slightly behind her the way someone does who wants to be in your company and not your conversation, and then because he is not a fool he made himself a fool and said the thing no one knew how to say without ruining a day. \u201cYou stapled a cough,\u201d he said, so mildly that the needles of the words found her late.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d she said. \u201cI was sorry as soon as I did it. He wrote me and said his chest stopped troubling him and then he didn\u2019t know how to clear his throat when he was alone and someone spoke at the door and he hadn\u2019t had a chance to think yet. He said he sat there with his mouth open like a fish when the man with the pamphlets came and he could not conjure the cough and so he had to listen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too good a tool for a person,\u201d Bram said, as if he could tuck the pronouncement into a pocket and hope never to have to take it out. \u201cIt makes invitations.\u201d\n\nLater, after fence and bells and a blunt conversation with Corwin about forms, the Council called a meeting in the clay arcades. Laleh sat on a pottery wheel like a queen of things that spin and a girl filled a jug with questions and then poured them on the floor in a shape that looked like ambition. The locksmith\u2019s pretty son leaned in a corner he had not asked permission to lean against and smiled at things that did not exist. The city attended the way the city attends when it smells a change: it bought cinnamon in lengths and argued about umbrellas and left early and came back to complain that it had missed the important part.\n\nThe sheep came. Not as a column. As themselves, which meant as a decision distributed over many animals and held together by notes. You could hear the bleats and tell that some were boredom and some worry and some hunger and some the sound a creature makes when the hoof is clean and the field is quiet and there is work and no sword. Helmets under arms, they walked without marching and stood without arranging themselves into meaning you could get from above. They watched the corners like scholars of geometry looking at somebody else\u2019s theorem. The leader had the wrong tooth and the scar that looked like the piece of a moon. He dipped his head. It was not submission. It was politeness.\n\nCorwin stood on a crate because he wanted very much to be taller just for today, just until the pen he held felt as useful as he hoped. \u201cWe propose a charter,\u201d he said, in a voice he had practiced that morning in a mirror and in the kettle. \u201cNot a treaty, because a treaty presumes we could both be somewhere else if we liked. A charter presumes we are where we are because we care to be and because we intend to carry on being here under certain conditions. Conditions include: you don\u2019t take our corners; we don\u2019t pretend your eyes are circles. You warn us about wolves, the path kind, the tooth kind, the people kind. We warn you about our unpredictable habits, which are legion and were raised without oversight. We will accept bells. We will not accept pens in our bedrooms.\u201d\n\nThe leader listened, which looked like chewing. Bram stood alongside and said nothing because sometimes the right amount of shepherd in the room is exactly one, and he had decided he had already been that today. Laleh wrote. The crowd made a noise that could go either way and pinned it to the air like a piece of laundry so that they could point later and say, we said something.\n\nMara watched the leader\u2019s eyes go door-wide when a cloud moved. She watched the way the sheep did not like the sound the pottery wheel made when its belt slipped and the potter swore softly, fashioning the air back into his own. She held the stabler down by her side and hoped no one would ask her to hold up her hand and swear. She did not want to. She wanted to staple the idea of a charter to the day and then take her pockets for a walk. She wanted Bram to say something gnomic and wrong that made her think for an hour. She wanted Corwin to be less careful. She wanted the boy with the kite to find the right wind and let it out like a sentence that knows it is going to be read aloud.\n\nWhen the charter had been spoken and the bleats had the sound of consent\u2014not exactly consent, something like \u201cwe are amenable\u201d\u2014when the bells had been distributed behind hands into a dozen apron pockets, people began to treat the sheep as sheep. This is to say: they tried to feed them. A child with a fistful of mint held it up and was nearly tipped over by a polite mouth. A baker brought the ends of bread like an apology to Scythes and offered them as if bread can solve allegory. Three men went off to get combs. A girl plaited red into her own hair in copy of a wrist she had seen and decided that would make her see like a sheep, which is the kind of magic the city understands. Corwin was given a bell and he jangled it exactly once and looked terrified by the thinness of the sound and did not do it again.\n\nMara excused herself before she could be asked to fix anybody\u2019s promise, and went to look for a crack. Not because she wanted to close it; because she wanted to be made to leave something alone. She found one where two stones met and had never quite forgiven each other for being near. She put her finger along it and felt how the day had slipped down into its little canyon and slept there quietly. She did not open the jaw. She did not sigh for it. She only hummed, low, a song she did not remember learning, a thing with no words that knew how to follow a line and not turn it into a path. The crack ignored her, which was its right. She felt better.\n\nThe wolves did not wait for the charter to be argued through the Council\u2019s appetite. They arrived that night under the sort of wrong that looks like wind. Bram had given her words for them: path-wolves of habit, of repetition, of the way the ground prefers to remember footsteps rather than make new prints. Corwin had given her words too: deliverables, metrics, engagement. None of those words helped when the first of them slipped along the iron seam and pressed its suggestion into the dirt near the fence and the bells refused to ring because the wrong was so polite. It was the hour when people think they are quietly being themselves and in truth they are most available to becoming someone else. The sheep heard them first. The sound they made brought the city to windows and then to shoes and then to the fence with cups still in their hands because all emergencies are improved by the presence of dishes.\n\nThey were not wolves the way a child draws wolves, with teeth like the crowns of hills and breath that makes frost jealous. They were long and low and did not quite touch the ground; they were smudges with decisions, precise where a foot should go and indefinite where a tail might be. They were made of every time you went the same way home because why not, you know it, it knows you, why test yourself. They pressed against the fence not with strength but with patience. They made the fence think about its favorite places to lean. The bells said nothing. The sheep bleated in a tone Mara had not heard and could not inventory. It was not fear, not in a way she had a label for. It was a sound like the number five.\n\nBram stepped into the groove a wolf had made and whistled a note Mara wanted to put on a shelf and dust. The wolf hesitated, the way a thought will when you interrupt it with laughter. Corwin came with his pen and the woman from Public Safety came with nine men and six women and a roll of chalk. They began to draw circles around the places where the ground had decided to become somebody\u2019s habit. Chalk is a kind of magic even grown-ups will keep in the kitchen. Laleh arrived with a notebook and did not write down anything except the way the sheep had lined themselves along the fence in such a way that if you were a wolf made of persistence you would feel the exact pressure of being watched.\n\nMara held the stabler and put its mouth to the fence where two wires touched and meant to keep meaning to. She pressed and felt the sigh go sideways, into the attention of the wolves, which is to say into the places where they were not yet wolves but could be if they were encouraged. She had not known she could do that. She set the tool at the seam and found the exact notch where the iron loved itself most, if iron can be said to indulge. She stapled that to the day, she stapled that to the fence, she stapled that to the way children turned their heads when their mothers said their names. She did not do it more than three times because Bram had told her once that three is the polite number when a person is listening and you do not know yet if they want to be persuaded.\n\nThe wolves pressed and in pressing revealed their edges, because everything that persists has to show you where it begins and ends eventually or else it never existed. She saw the noses, if noses are the first place a decision comes out of the dark. She saw the shoulders, if shoulders are the parts of a thought that move the rest. She saw the permanent mark they wished to make. She pressed again and fastened the moment to itself. One of the wolves stepped into a circle the woman had chalked and hesitated because chalk is old. It remembers when we used to write on the ground to ask the sky to take us seriously. It did not cross the line. It moved along the circumference and tried to become the circle\u2019s twin and tired and stopped and looked at its friends the way you do when you\u2019ve gotten lost and think you can pretend that was your plan.\n\nThe bells at last chose to admit that they had roles. They rang. It was not loud. None of this ever was. It was quiet enough to make you hate yourself for making too much noise with your thoughts. The sheep looked at Mara in a way that felt like someone had folded a page of a book you were trying to keep clean, and dipped their heads, and then did something complicated with their bodies that made the pressure change. It was a flock thing. You move here and you move here and you let there be a hole there and a wall there and suddenly the choice the wolf wanted is no longer inevitable. The path the wolf loved most had a hill in it of a sort that did not exist before and now did.\n\nAfter a long hour the wolves left. They left the way you stop thinking about a bad decision that wants to become a habit: you tell yourself a story about something else. They will come back. They are wolves. That is what wolves are for. The bells kept ringing after because bells take their time the way grief does. People went home with cups, finally empty, and shoes, finally noticed. Bram sat on the ground and folded his stick along his thighs and sighed in a way that was not at all like a seam finding itself; it was a way a person exhales when they have postponed despair without cancelling it.\n\nCorwin put a hand on the fence not to claim it and not to bless it but to discover if the fence was the sort of object that could be grateful. He found it could, a little, and smiled and looked more tired than she had ever allowed him to look. Laleh closed her notebook without writing the paragraph that would tell the city that wolves have good manners and bad ideas and that all of them are easier to manage than men.\n\nMara went home with the tool under her arm, which was asleep in the way tools sleep, which is to say ready. She thought of the man who had coughed and pressed pencil into paper to tell her a word she did not properly understand. She thought of the saucers on her table and the way they had organized themselves in her absence into a pattern that meant nothing and everything, as patterns do. She thought of the crack she had found and not mended and felt the pride of restraint and the itch of neglect. She fed the plant in the sink, which had been deprived of its water earlier by a tool with its own notions. It drank and forgave. Plants are good at that.\n\nAt the door she found a note under the mat because people still do that when they want you to find a thing with your foot before your eye. It smelled of pencil and wool and a kitchen with bread cooling. It said, in Bram\u2019s writing, which always made you think his pen had a limp: We need to go to the quarry tomorrow. Bring the thing. Don\u2019t tell Corwin until we are there. He will pretend he thought of it. There are sheep up high that do not come down and a sound that is not a wolf and not a bell and not the rain in the mouth of the pipe. We should listen to whatever it is saying to the iron. Also I have more coffee if you bring a saucer.\n\nShe read it twice and then put it against the cold of the window and watched it fog the tiny bit a note can fog. The city turned itself into shapes around her like a cat looking for the right shape to sleep in. She closed the curtains and let the day unhook from its corners. The tool in the sink did not look like anything you could write a rule about. It looked like a thing that would one day be a story someone else told, with your name in it if you were unlucky, with your face softened by time and other people\u2019s memory. She went to bed and lay on her side with one hand on her stomach and one on the blankets and thought about fences and wolves and the way you can staple a seam and still be kind.\n\nIn the morning the market smelled like cinnamon and rain. Children had chalk on their knees. A man had painted a bell on his door and then rang it until his wife said she liked the real one better. The sheep had left a pattern in the dust that Mara wanted to write down and then decided if she wrote down their pattern it would become easier to predict and she would be tempted to use that prediction like a hammer. She folded her coat the way Bram folded his stick and put the stabler in the pocket you put things in when you want them close enough to deny they are heavy. She brought a saucer that was cracked handsomely, because we should always put our best cracked things in circulation when we can.\n\nBram was at the foot of the quarry road, looking like a man who had already climbed it and decided to go again for the luxury of complaining. He had the air of someone who had been in company with a sound all night. \u201cThe sheep up there,\u201d he said, without hello because it was a morning when hello would have been a delay, \u201cthey stand on ledges and put their ears to stone and hum. I have never seen them do that. I think the iron is speaking to them. I think the seam is telling them a story about itself from before it was a seam. I would like to know if what they are hearing is a warning or a comfort. Bring your tool but do not put it on the iron unless it asks.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does asking look like,\u201d Mara said, already her feet making decisions about where to find purchase on a slope that had forgiven too many people already.\n\n\u201cIt looks like every part of you being quiet at the same time,\u201d Bram said, which was not useful and always was.\n\nThe quarry opened around them like a mouth with its tongue torn out. There were ledges and scars and the smell of a world being made convenient for other worlds. The sheep stood like statues at intervals and put their heads sideways as if collecting rain in a cup made of ear. When they hummed, the air thickened the way a room does when someone you have loved finally says the thing they have been promising to say and you have no idea if it is what you wanted to hear. The hum had age in it. It had the grit of timelines. It had the shape of a road that had not yet decided which village deserved it.\n\nMara held the stabler and did not use it. Bram closed his eyes and looked like a man discovering an old prayer pinned under a new one. The sheep lifted their heads together and bleated once, a sound that sounded less like bleeding and more like the hinge of a gate being honest about needing oil. The iron sang back. It was not a wolf and not a bell and not the rain in the mouth of a pipe. It was a seam telling a story: I was the riverbed you forgot. I was the length of a dragon\u2019s sleep. I was where men in armor counted their steps and learned to stack metal on metal and call it safety.\n\nCorwin appeared at the top of the path because a man like that cannot be left out of a paragraph even if you try, carrying himself like someone who has already written down what is going to happen and will be embarrassed at how wrong he is but will recover. He opened his mouth to ask for permission to be in the presence of a thing he would eventually regulate. The sheep looked at him kindly and went on listening. Bram put his finger along the iron as if taking a pulse. Mara felt the tool shiver, not with fear, which it did not believe in, but with recognition. The iron did not ask, not yet. She let her fingers curl around the handle and waited to be quiet. She made a list of all the corners she would not touch today. She put her name at the bottom of the list, which felt like the right order.\n\nBelow them, along the seam, the chalk circles had caught a new shape. Not a wolf. Not a man. Not a sheep. A sort of loose, like a plan that had not been agreed upon but was walking around anyway seeing if anyone would mistake it for official. It moved toward the city and the bell fence the way a thought moves toward a sentence. Bram inhaled. The sheep stepped backward without any one of them deciding to. Corwin lifted his pen because you reach for who you are when you are afraid. The iron lifted its story by one octave and something under the earth cleared its throat. The stabler warmed in Mara\u2019s hand like a cat vowing nothing and promising everything.",

                              "content": "The iron sang again, and this time the note lengthened until it felt like a rope thrown between two boats. Mara felt it tug at her wrists and become the kind of question you didn\u2019t answer with words so much as with posture. Bram\u2019s eyes had gone narrow, not from suspicion but from care, like a man sighting the line between two long grasses to see what runs there, and the Public Safety woman had her chalk poised above the ground, waiting for the moment when a circle is a ceremony and not just a shape. Corwin\u2019s pen had found his breast pocket and stayed there as if relieved; this was no place for ink. The loose shape below\u2014an intention without a skin\u2014tested the chalk rim again and strolled along it, shoulderless and sure until it faltered at a corner and went dim because corners are interruptions, and interruptions are the only things that have ever saved a city. The sheep on the ledges hummed in thirds and then in a low ribbon of fifths, and Mara felt the weak places in the seam flinch as if embarrassed to be caught slouching. The tool in her hand leaned toward the iron the way a moth leans toward a porch light and stopped just before singeing because some lessons you only have to learn once.\n\nShe had been told to wait until the iron asked, and in the din of hum and thought and the audible stamina of stone, she heard it. It was not a word. It was a thinning, the sound a thread makes when a little boy pulls it through a hole in his sweater and the sweater considers becoming something else. It was not urgent. It was patient, which was worse. Mara lifted the stabler and balanced its open jaw just above a seam-shoulder that had tried too often to be a road and failed and then decided to make the failure permanent. She did not close it. She looked at Bram, whose stick rested against his leg like a tame river, and he nodded once, not as license but as witness. A sheep with a burr in its flank turned its rectangular eye upon her and dipped its head, and that was all she was going to get from the wool.\n\n\u201cIf you behave,\u201d she said quietly to the tool, which was the only way she could behave herself, \u201cI will find you something beautiful later to fasten that has no consequence. I will staple a ribbon to a child\u2019s hair and you may preen.\u201d The stabler warmed the way a face warms when you compliment the wrong thing but mean it kindly, and she closed the jaw on iron and air and wool together because there was a tuft caught on the stone and she would have been foolish not to include it in the bargain. The sigh moved through the ledges and through the chalk, which lifted in a draught and then settled into itself like a cat resettling in its own fur. The loose shape below stumbled over the suddenly well-behaved notch the seam made and broke into three smaller notions, each less convinced of its own inevitability than the last.\n\nCorwin exhaled as if he had been holding his breath since the sea was invented. The Public Safety woman squinted down the slope and then up at Mara as if to say: I have a warehouse of rope and barrels of nails and none of them do what you just did, which is both infuriating and a relief. Bram did not move. The sheep moved in a way that made the ledges look briefly like grammar and then like melody again, and one of them bleated a sound that had the comfort of a closing door without the insult of being shut out. The iron\u2019s story softened back down to where it could be ignored by a man buying a pie and cherished by a dog that knew the difference between weather and news.\n\n\u201cDo not do it again here,\u201d Bram said, friendly as a fencepost. \u201cYou\u2019ve set the staple deep because you included what the seam thinks of itself. That means if you fix another length too close you\u2019ll make them call to each other and then we will have a wall where a seam belongs. People do not like walls unless they can paint them, and I do not wish to explain to the Council why we are suddenly a castle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no interest in castles,\u201d Mara said, and it was true until the moment the word made a structure in the air and she realized: a castle is only corners with better publicity. The stabler settled against her palm and breathed. It did that, sometimes, when it had eaten well. She wanted very much to laugh and did not, because of Corwin\u2019s face, which had the look of a man who had just watched someone fix his job by accident. The Public Safety woman spoke first because that was her craft. \u201cWe will run rope down from the ledge,\u201d she said, pointing, \u201cand hang bells where the iron flinches. Your chalk circles can be made official. I can get the city to sign a paper that says we respect the difference between a road and a rut. It will make no difference to the wolves, but it will make a difference to men.\u201d\n\nThe loose shape down on the flat did not dissolve so much as lose credibility. A plan undone. It slid toward the sea like an idea hoping salt would fix it, which never works and always looks elegant. The sheep watched it leave with the mild disdain of a creature that has survived a thousand versions of a thing and knows all their endings, and then they turned back toward their ledges and put their ears to stone again as if the seam had gone back to telling them a story worth being quiet for. Corwin put his hand on the iron the way a boy in church pats a carved saint when no one is looking. He nodded, small, as if the iron had told him something he had understood and promised not to repeat. He was not the sort of man who would keep that promise, but he was at least the sort who would be embarrassed when he broke it.\n\nOn the climb down, when the air stopped buzzing and the earth resumed its old habit of pretending it never speaks, Bram shouldered his stick and let a breath out as if someone had called his name from very far away and then decided it was a different Bram they wanted. \u201cNight-stabler,\u201d he said, not fussing over the word as if proud to be holding something old enough to splinter. \u201cThere was a woman once, up in Prent\u2019s Fold, who bound storms. Not to the fence\u2014don\u2019t look at me like that, I can tell that\u2019s where your head goes. She tied them to themselves. Gave the thunder back to the clouds and the clouds back to the thunder and told the hill to sit down and not take anything personally. It worked, until it didn\u2019t. She did a fourth, after three, because somebody she liked was coming over the saddle and did not deserve to drown. She kept the storm for him and after that all our weather was tired for a year. Grain sulked. Children were listless. Even the dogs dreamed of shade. The hill forgave her, eventually, but it named a gully for her in a way that makes the gully a warning if you know your maps.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like three,\u201d Mara said, to make her mouth believe it. \u201cI liked three in school, when teachers made us speak to be certain we had learned. Once to say it. Once to demonstrate it. Once to be sure we would remember the shape of the saying. Four is show-off business. Four is thinking you are the outside of your own life.\u201d She gripped the tool until it ceased thinking about jumping.\n\nCorwin caught up, wearing the look of someone about to make himself useful so that he could forgive himself later for having been frightened. \u201cWe will need to draft guidance,\u201d he said, and Bram barked a laugh so abrupt the sheep on the ledge above them turned their heads as one. \u201cNo, listen,\u201d Corwin went on, a man pleading with laughter to be kind. \u201cIf we are to tell people not to overfasten their corners, we have to define corner. If we are to tell them wolves can be undone by chalk and singing and that woman\u2019s impossible device, we have to distribute chalk and bells and some species of patience. We have to tell people that they themselves are the best part of the fence and the worst, depending on the hour they wake.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut all of that on a poster,\u201d Mara said, and surprised herself by meaning no harm. \u201cAdd a picture of a lamb for the children to color. Add a corner\u2014no, two\u2014and a line in the middle one must not cross. Try to avoid words like mandate, which make people yawn and then rebel. Perhaps staple one to every door.\u201d She knew she had said the word on purpose and did not apologize for it. He deserved to have his verbs stolen now and then.\n\nThey met the shepherds where the path widened into conversation. A woman with hair like old straw made new smiled at the stabler the way you smile at a very large sweet dog that hasn\u2019t chosen a target yet. \u201cStabler?\u201d she asked, and Mara nodded. \u201cGood,\u201d the woman said. \u201cThe iron will talk faster now it has found an ear that knows when to close.\u201d She held out a hand. \u201cTamsin. I keep the bells from turning vain and the dogs from falling in love with their own work. If you need wool that has not yet learned bad habits, you ask me. If you need wool that has learned every habit and can teach you which ones are useful, you ask Calder, who has been old since birth and hasn\u2019t noticed. We will make a calling cry you can hear in your kitchen when we need you. It will sound like the kettle behaving wrong. You will be disgusted by it and you will be quick.\u201d\n\nMara felt her ribs grow a size and make room for a new kind of hurry. \u201cIf the iron asks and I am peeling potatoes,\u201d she said, and left it there because that was a better prayer than anything with saints in it. Tamsin nodded as if Mara had passed some exam that had never been written down. Bram, looking relieved to let someone else stand in front, turned to Corwin and said, \u201cWrite your charter, binder-man, but add a clause that says we are permitted to not be the sort of people who need charters on Wednesdays. The hill doesn\u2019t understand Wednesdays but it does like kindness. If you teach the city to do that, we might forgive it its squares.\u201d\n\nBack in the ring market, word had arrived ahead of them in the tiny feet of speculation and hung from awnings like drying apricots. People always think they deserve to be there when something important happens, and this weathered their disappointment by letting them tell the story wrong to the exact right audience. Laleh leaned in the doorway of the locksmith\u2019s stall with her notebook folded and the pencil tucked behind her ear like a proposal she intended to reject out of affection. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d she said as Mara came up the lane, soft as any prayer. \u201cI know you have a speech about three and restraint and why walls are rude. Save it for the Council. Tell me instead what the iron said. Did it mention me. Did it praise my posture. Did it complain about the way we all walk on it with our heads too high.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt told a story about when it was a river,\u201d Mara said, handing the other woman the saucer she had promised Bram and he had shoved back at her when she insisted on climbing again. \u201cIt told a story about steps. It did not mention you because it has decided not to flatter us in ways that make no difference. Your headline will have to do without references.\u201d\n\nLaleh grinned and made a face like she had just eaten a word that had improved her teeth. \u201cYou are cruel,\u201d she said. \u201cThank you. Cruelty is a kindness in my trade. Do you know that three men today asked me to write their names near yours. As if I were a grocer and fame a loaf. I told one I would write him next to Bram so that he could feel tall. I told another I would write him next to Corwin because he would be misquoted forever and that was a sort of immortality. I told the last I would write him next to the sheep and he cried. You should stop making allegory in public. It confuses us.\u201d\n\nThe bells at the seam were being strung by late afternoon, a pretty sound for an ugly purpose. The city had decided it would accept bells the way it had accepted saucers and saucer-women and fence-post poetry: with a shrug and then an opinion. Children stole pieces of chalk and drew circles around their own feet and declared themselves exempt from chores until the circles were scuffed. The locksmith\u2019s pretty son presented Mara with a ring of keys not matched to anything in particular and said, \u201cNo one should go to the hill without jingling; the wolves dislike comedians.\u201d She took it and felt how the cold metal made her tool sulk and smiled at the sulking because she was becoming that person, the one who found personality in steel and was not ashamed.\n\nThe first letter arrived that night from the coughing man who had given her the tool. It came folded around itself in a way that made you think it had been experimenting with other forms of envelope and had not liked them. It smelled of sachet and ash and, faintly, of sheep. The writing was thicker than she remembered, less frantic, more in conversation with itself. He did not sign. People who send important objects do not reveal themselves unless they mean to give you a second thing.\n\nI called it a stabler for reasons that have nothing to do with pins, the letter said, as if indulging her backstory. In the language I am no longer allowed to speak in public, it is a person. It stabils, which is to say it makes the jostled remember that they have elbows and should keep them to themselves. It keeps that which will be kept. It is more patient than any of us. It has rules, which is useful, and appetites, which is not. You should feed it chores, not chores that someone else has failed to do\u2014that will sour it\u2014but chores that no one person could do without becoming insufferable. If you can tell the difference you will be fine, or as fine as any of us are. Do not, if you can help it, make it an heirloom. This is a short-term device. The long term belongs to nothing we can hold.\n\nShe read it twice and then tucked it between two saucers where it would be hard to find and easy to reach. She made a list: corners done, corners spared, corners that would ask her in their own time. She wrote in the margins: wolves, bells, chalk, Laleh, Corwin\u2019s pen, Bram\u2019s gully, Tamsin\u2019s thread. She added at the bottom: dear. She did not cross it out. She drank water without tasting it, because her mouth had grown heavy with iron\u2019s story and she needed to let it forget itself for a minute.\n\nSleep came only because the city demanded it. The city is a tyrant and a nanny; it bolts your door some nights whether you agree or not. She dreamed as if someone had borrowed her head to classify a museum: cases labeled ROUTINE and IMPULSE and SHEEP and MEN and WOLVES and LOVE, with index cards tucked under each with notes to the curator about what had been mis-shelved and what had been stolen and what had been stapled by mistake. In the dream a boy put his nose to the glass of LOVE and breathed on it, and an alarm went off in the next room where someone was cataloguing brass. She woke with the lingering sense that she had been useful to someone less careful than she would prefer.\n\nMorning brought rain that behaved, which is to say it went where gravity told it and not where gossip suggested. The bells at the seam let themselves be quiet until a girl ran along them with a stick and made a song that had the exact number of notes necessary to get her scolded. Mara boiled water because she had promised the kettle a life of adventure and because Bram had threatened to appear without warning if she did not. He appeared exactly when it boiled, which is the sort of magic you can rely on when you have known a person for the right amount of weeks and also for your whole life. He did not knock. He held his hat by the brim like a creature and petted it absentmindedly as if it had been very brave out in the weather.\n\n\u201cThey wrote a clause,\u201d he said over the first cup, as if apologizing for somebody else\u2019s handwriting. \u201cCorwin and the Council. It says: \u2018In the matter of corners, all citizens shall endeavor to leave some for the air to tuck itself into.\u2019 It\u2019s not bad. It\u2019s a sentence that knows what it wants to do with itself. There\u2019s a committee forming to define endeavor, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Mara said, fishing the letter from the saucers and sliding it across where Bram could put his finger on the place where a stranger had reminded them both that tools have tempers. \u201cHe says chores, not miracles. He says if I hand it a future to hold it will sulk until that future arrives and then drop it, which is a kind of justice and a kind of rudeness.\u201d\n\nBram read and nodded. \u201cHe is right. There is something in this that does not like our myths. It will not hold a prophecy. It will not hold anyone\u2019s hope if the hope has a face. It will hold exactly as long as kindness, which is to say until lunchtime and then again at tea.\u201d He set the page down and took another mouth of coffee and then set that down, too, because the bell in his brain had been struck by a distant hand. \u201cHear that,\u201d he said, and she did not, which frightened her more than the sound would have. He cocked his head. \u201cA new wrong. Not wolves. Not path. Not iron being asked to be a spine again. Paper. Too much paper.\u201d\n\nIt was astonishing how quickly the city could make a creature out of paper. By noon men and women who had never filled a form in complete sentences were collecting signatures with a fervor usually reserved for ship departures and births. They had found the quiet place at the heart of the Council\u2019s clause and they had decided to make it shout. Petitions sprouted like mushrooms: to require bells on every belt, to forbid wolves from appearing in allegory in classrooms, to prevent sheep from receiving combs without a license, to commission a statue of a woman holding a stapler on the plinth where the man with the sword had looked tired for a century and a half. Laleh was in the square with a laugh that had borrowed gold and was lending it at interest. Corwin stood on the steps of the Council building with a face like weather, trying to remember the taste of authority while not tasting its salt too greedily. The Public Safety woman had stopped three arguments by reminding their loudest participants where they kept their spines. The petitions grew teeth. Paper makes edges if you stack it enough.\n\nMara did not intend to use the stabler on paper. That would be indecent, like wearing your grandmother\u2019s pearls to a boxing match. She took it with her anyway and stood very still at the edge of the square the way you stand when a dance is happening that could become a fight. Bram drifted at an angle that kept him between a boy\u2019s ruckus and an old woman\u2019s indignation and made both of them steer better. The sheep did not come. The sheep had the better sense to be at the seam listening to iron\u2019s memory instead of counting the ways a city can be foolish in public.\n\nOne petition in particular wound around the others like a more convincing vine. It made no demand and carried no signature lines. It was a shape, drawn with ink the color of nights in your childhood, the kind where your mother moved through the kitchen and said nothing because saying would have woken the smallest child and the smallest had been an angel all day. The shape had corners and then did not. It had a gate and then it had a wall and then it had a seam and then it had a road, and if you held your breath and squinted you could see the path-wolves trotting along its edges pleased as boys who have been told to take the long way on purpose. Underneath, someone had written Why Not. It was not a question. It was a dare.\n\nMara felt the tool in her pocket roll over and open one eye. She felt the crowd, that organism with too many hearts, loose itself toward the wrong.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Corwin said through his teeth, watching her take the step that made the square bite down instead of swallow. \u201cFine. Come and staple our courage to our better natures. Do it gently, if you love me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never loved you at all,\u201d Mara said with the easy emphasis friends get to borrow when they intend to hand it back later. She did not look for a post or a rug or a fence. She went to the drawn shape and put the stabler\u2019s mouth on the corner where the wall had remembered it had been a gate and had been proud of the memory in a way that made it susceptible to flattery. She looked at Bram and he shook his head because this was paper and paper keeps grudges longer than iron. She looked at the Public Safety woman and she tilted her chin the way a dog does when it hears its favorite word and is uncertain whether it was truly spoken. She looked at the crowd and hated them a little for needing her, which is the right way to love a city.\n\nShe closed the jaw and the sigh folded the sound of the square back down into bodies. The drawn corner held. The gate did not become a wall. The seam did not forget itself into a road. The wolves that had been waiting in the tautness of air, in the impatience of men, lost interest like boys when you tell them the sweets will taste of cough medicine. The paper fluttered because paper must always pretend to be the wind in miniature. The petitions around it went on shouting in ink, but what they shouted had lost its verb. People looked sheepish and some of them looked like sheep, a little, which is what happens when you survive something you almost invited in. Corwin sat down on the steps and laughed until his eyes were wet and then stood up and pretended he had been conferring with someone important. Laleh came and looked and did not write and said, \u201cI could kiss you and that would ruin us both, so instead I am going to drink all your coffee and misquote you on purpose.\u201d\n\nIf the day had ended there, if the bell fence had found its pitch and the petitions had found their limits and the iron had told its story and slept, chaptering the afternoon into something like calm, the city would have gone to bed with a headache and woken with an anecdote. But the seam had decided it was a talker now, and talkers breed talk. Near twilight, when the clay arcades turn purple and the smell of cinnamon shifts into the smell of sums being done and sums being lied about, a sound came\u2014not from the hill and not from the square. From the water. A bell without a hand. A toll that had never been taught politeness. The sea began to ring.\n\nBram and Mara both looked up as if the sky had said their names, and Corwin finally did the one thing he was best built for and least praised for: he moved a crowd without being seen to move it. The Public Safety woman had men on the bell fence in a breath and women with chalk at the quays in two and by the third someone had decided to lower the harbor chain, which had always been ornamental but had liked to dream. The sheep arrived in a hurry that made no hooves sound, and you knew, seeing them, that this was their country in a way that streets never would be. Their wool had taken on the light of cockleshells. Their eyes were enormous doors. They went ahead without us and stood with their sleeves rolled up to their knees at the lip of the tide.\n\nThe bell the sea rang was not ours. It belonged to something that had been promised a long time ago and had come at last to collect, tired of our delays. The sound made tin taste of apples. It made shore birds forget their debts. It made a woman at the fish stall drop a knife and swear as if swearing were a prayer and prayers had just reminded her of how to be useful. Bruises hummed under shirts and were briefly proud. The stabler burned hot in Mara\u2019s coat, and for the first time she did not know which way to point its mouth.\n\n\u201cWhat is it,\u201d Corwin said, and he said it to Bram because this was not for pen or binder. Bram, who had more names for wrongs than anyone Mara had met and a calm for each, looked at the water and did not look away when it bucked like an animal with the bridle wrong.\n\n\u201cHarbor-will,\u201d he said, and took off his hat because some words require that ritual even on weekdays. \u201cOld pledge. The first men who stacked shields into a staircase stood at that chain and told the sea that if it wanted their iron it could have it but it would have to wait until they had done with it. The sea does not like to wait. It has been patient for a century and a half, and now it has scented our fussing and decided to try again. It will not take the iron. Not all of it. It will try to take our habit of thinking we can tell it when.\u201d\n\nThe sea sent a sheet up the chain that roared without spray, as if water had finally learned indoor manners. The sheep bleated a chord that made sailors cry for their mothers and then be embarrassed forever. The chain, which had been a prop in civic plays and a place to put your foot when telling a story to a child, stood into the sound and did not break. It did something worse. It learned the note and hummed back. The will in it woke, with a stretch like a man who has slept badly and is promised a good chair.\n\n\u201cCircles,\u201d the Public Safety woman barked, and the chalk women did their work without apology even though chalk and tide do not respect each other. \u201cCorners,\u201d Corwin said at the same time, almost without meaning to, because even a wave must decide what shape to take when it meets a quay. \u201cDo not staple,\u201d Bram said very quietly to Mara, and she would have been offended at being told her own business if fear had not curdled her blood into something obedient. \u201cNot the water. Not a bell that has no handle. If you fasten this, the sea will take your word as bond and we will never eat mackerel again.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I do,\u201d she asked him, for once not because she wanted to hear his sentences but because she could not find her own. Bram\u2019s eyes were full of ships he would never sail. He put his fingers about an inch apart and made a shape in the air. \u201cYou staple me,\u201d he said. \u201cTo the post. For three breaths. Only three. I will whistle and the chain will remember that it was meant to be friend and not father. Then you take the staple out. This one you take out.\u201d He held out his arm and it was an old arm and also it was a stick. He smelled like wet wool that knows the story of its own lanolin.\n\nShe had never un-stapled. She had assumed that was work for decay and time and salt. She reached for the letter opener, the bone-handled maybe-knife she had used on cinnamon toast and once to show a boy that paper is more dangerous than it looks. It had a notch near the tip, a small cunning smile she had never understood. When she slid it into the stabler\u2019s mouth, the tool sighed in a different octave and her hands knew without thinking how to set a seam loose. She had not been taught. The instruments taught each other while she slept, the way they always do if they share a drawer.\n\nShe pressed him to the quay. The sigh went out under his skin and into the post and made them family. He whistled the way he had whistled for wolves\u2019 thoughts earlier but differently, with a flattery in it that made water preen. The chain forgot that it had been counted and remembered that once it had been sung. The sea lifted and considered and put its hand down. The bell hushed\u2014not because it had been answered, but because it had been offered a better story. \u201cNow,\u201d Bram said, not loud, and she slid the bone under the staple-that-wasn\u2019t and lifted, and the sense of the thing let go and ran away like a child who has discovered that its prank has stopped being a game.\n\nThe sea went back to being too much for everyone. The sheep went back to being good at their work and indifferent to being honored for it. Corwin sat because his legs had endured too much being a public servant for one day. The Public Safety woman wrote down three things on the back of her hand and smudged them and wrote them again. Laleh appeared with hair wet at the ends and wrote a line that would later read as calm and had not been. The chain drooped into the tolerance we call slack. Mara wiped the bone clean on her skirt and had no regret for the stain.\n\n\u201cYou did not keep me,\u201d Bram said, checking his arm as if it were a separate creature and he a farmer at inspection, and she shrugged and then shook because sometimes what you have done arrives at your body late. \u201cYou asked me to be kept,\u201d she said, stubborn as any corner. \u201cThere is a difference.\u201d He put his hat back on because some men cannot endure gratitude in the open air and need brim for it.\n\nNight found the city tired and pleased to be. The petitions thinned and went to bed under dishes. The seam hummed a lullaby stolen from a shepherd long gone. Wolves lay in their chalk circles and complained of boredom to no one in particular. The bell fence wore fog and looked holy. In her kitchen, Mara put the stabler and the bone into the sink together and felt them knock teeth, an intimate and irritating sound. She set the saucers back into their pattern and found, in the un-useful space where the pattern failed itself and the table insisted on being wood, a place where her hand could rest and mean it. She ate bread without butter and did not apologize to anyone for liking it. She put wool beside the letter and the letter beside the spoon and the spoon beside the day and decided, not for the first time, that being tired was a kind of prayer that the morning generally granted.\n\nThere is no moral for a day like this. The best you can do is promise to tell it true later, and then keep finding ways to keep your later from becoming a rut. The city slept the way a pen runs dry: usefully. The sea, having been flattered, permitted itself to forget we existed until it needed us to make a story more interesting. Above, in the quarry, sheep pressed their heads to iron and dreamed of grass because everyone dreams of the thing they have already. Bram lay on his side with his stick between his knees like a fence he needed to keep nearby so he didn\u2019t dream of breaking it. Corwin dreamed of signing his own name in a ledger that forgave him for ignorance and felt, the moment before waking, what it would be like to mean it. And Mara, in the small upslope of an apartment that had once been a broom closet and had become a bridge, slept between her tools as if between two versions of herself and woke at dawn with the taste of bells in her teeth and the certainty that the quiet between three and four would not belong to any creature tomorrow.",

                              "content": "Mara woke from a dream in which saucers had argued about gravity and the argument had left a taste of steel on her tongue, and it took a minute for her to be certain that the mouthful of bells she carried into the day belonged to night and not to a mistake she had made just now with her teeth. The tool in the sink had shifted to the far side of the basin as if preferring the company of the bone-handled letter opener, which made domestic sense in the way a spoon decides a drawer is friendlier if a whisk is nearby. She put water on because Bram would arrive as if tied to the boil, and while she waited she did something she had only thought about, which was to ask the bone to teach her a rule. She slid it into the stabler\u2019s jaw and felt the little notch find a place like a tongue finding the sweet seed in a pomegranate, and she closed her eyes and pictured the seam at the quay where she had fastened Bram to the post for three breaths because he had asked. The notch warmed, and the muscles along her thumb told her unfastening has a different courage in it than fastening, and the water began to complain in the pot in the exact voice of Tamsin\u2019s promised calling-cry and then remembered itself and behaved. She did not try to unmake anything that did not ask. She had learned to listen for asking the way some people learned to watch for a child\u2019s lie to go glossy before it fell apart, and it made her tired to admit that what she had of wisdom had been purchased with that kind of eavesdropping.\n\nBram did not knock, which meant that something had gone right in the night and he had saved the knocking for the day when news would come in a bad hat. He put his stick on the table the way a man lays a violin down because he intends to tell someone why he no longer plays and then hopes they interrupt him before he has to. \u201cThe chain slept,\u201d he said, accepting his cup with his mouth already shaped around thank you and not using the words in case it dented them, \u201cand the wolves grumbled and lay in their circles and tried to trick each other and were bored by their cleverness. Tamsin says the iron told a story about ships that begins with the word no and ends with the word maybe and she is happier than I have seen her since her dog decided to like a baby. How is your convalescent instrument.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sulks if I group it with cutlery but preens if I make it think it is an heirloom,\u201d she said, and then would not let her face do the work of a smile, because there is a moment after a night when a sea has rung at you when your mouth should not lie even to comfort a friend. \u201cThe bone has a notch for undoing. It taught me while I slept, which is rude and a kindness. It will not release a seam if I fastened it for pride. It will only let go if I ask it to forgive me for making a choice it knows I made under duress. It has opinions and they are petty and right.\u201d\n\nBram lifted the bone, which was a delicate thing, heavier near the unnecessary beauty at the butt, and balanced it along his knuckles until it told him to be careful and he obeyed before he knew he had. \u201cEverything that undoes has opinions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why promise-breakers in the hills are made to tell the same story of their breaking to three different children on three different days; if the children believe the breaker, the promise was faulty and can be undone without cursing the weather. If one child finds a selfishness the other two did not see, the breaker keeps their shame for a while like a stone in a pocket to keep him from walking too fast into comfort. You should not use the bone on Wednesdays unless you are prepared to have your neighbors tell you later that they felt treacherous all afternoon and could not say why.\u201d\n\nThe kettle did an ungainly thing with steam that smelled, faintly, of wool, which meant the hill had breathed and the city had noticed. Mara poured and found the luxurious quiet that attends a day that intends to be difficult and is gentleman enough to give you coffee first. Corwin arrived with a newspaper under his arm and a page of the charter folded open to another page that scolded the public in an approachable font, and he stood with his back to the sink as if it were a door to a garden and he was making a point of not leaving as a way of showing his good breeding. \u201cWe are to sign,\u201d he said without invoking a subject for his verb because he had decided the city counted as that when he was in her kitchen. \u201cAt noon, in the arcades, with the bells strung and the sheep obliging us by not being late. The clause about corners has survived with fewer teeth marks than I expected. The clause about not attaching bells to infants in their prams has caused a rift with a certain class of parent. I will stand on a crate and say endeavor as if it meant love and hope the crowd knows the difference, which it does not.\u201d\n\nHe put the paper down, and the headline Laleh had written about the sea without naming it like a person who knew the force of proper nouns did a small bow across the grain of Mara\u2019s table. The pretty son of the locksmith arrived in the door in a tie askew and a question already written on his face that had nothing to do with keys. He was the sort of boy who made women who had made their peace with practical shoes reconsider laces, and he was the sort of boy who did not know it yet, which is the only safe version. \u201cMay I borrow a sliver,\u201d he asked, pointing not to the stabler but to the bone. \u201cAll I need is the smile on the tip. A bit of steel to lay in wax, for a cast. Someone is making a picking tool that undoes latches in the name of liberty and the name of liberty is a different man every afternoon. They asked me to cut a groove because I cut grooves the way my mother cut bread, without wasting the middle. I told them no, and they told me they would get it somewhere else, and I came here to be told I was right and to be called a fool if there is a third choice I do not see.\u201d\n\nMara did not hand him the bone because there are errands that should make a boy walk to someone older than desire, and she did not send him away because she remembered being the sort of person who wanted to be useful and could be tricked by any tool that shaped its mouth in need. She put her fingers around the opener\u2019s plain side and felt it say today is for refusals with gentle syllables, the way a grandmother tells a child no with a story about a fox, and she gave the boy the saucer that had been cracked handsomely and said, \u201cPractice your groove on this. A plate knows what it is to be asked to become something it is not and will teach you patience without giving you everything. If they ask you again, send them to me or to Tamsin. If they go to the men who sell rope in the alley behind the coops, the rope will learn their names before they know it and will expect to be paid in something other than coin.\u201d\n\nHe looked wounded in the way you can be wounded when you came for sanction and were given a lesson, and then he looked proud because the lesson had used him as if he were already real. He took the saucer, which shaped itself to him as if it had been looking for a young hand as a justification, and he bowed in the way boys forget how to do the moment someone lets them start wearing black, and he left with a promise to show her the groove and not to sell it to anybody with a hat that looked like it had been worn by three generations of men who had not read a book.\n\nThe square filled before the bells had finished practicing being polite, and it had that low thrum a market gets when everyone brings their very best disagreement and arranges it around fruit. The sheep came in a cluster that was not exactly a circle and not exactly an argument; they paused where the canvas made its favorite crease and laid their heads together in a way that made you want to be loved by something without hands. The charter lay on a table the grocer brought and was weighted at one corner with a bag of sugar and at another with a stone that had been a doorstop for so long it had opinions about thresholds. Corwin stood up on the crate and made endeavor sound like please, and the Public Safety woman stood beside him with her chalk in hand as if at any moment language might need to be put on the ground for the sake of a useful shape, and Laleh stood behind with a pencil that did not like lying and was prepared to be forced if it made the truth kinder.\n\nMara stood among the neighbors and resisted the honest tug of the tool in her pocket toward any place where two things wanted to pretend they had always been one thing, and she watched as the city did what cities do when presented with a promise disguised as prose: it sighed, it cracked a joke, it remembered a funeral, it leaned forward like men at a window when a cat attempts something athletic across the street. Bram took up a corner of the table because even a charter deserves a shepherd, and the sheep leader with the scar that would not be tamed put a hoof on the step and stared with a politeness that could be mistaken for dullness by anyone who had not watched a flock decide where to sleep. The clause about corners was read and came out of a different mouth than the one that had written it and still survived because the crowd had heard themselves in it in the weeks when they had stood near a corner and felt the weather settle there to rest. The clause about bells was read and a man who had been drunk on bells for three days shouted that he had been cured of the thirst by the sight of his neighbor\u2019s hat adorned with two and everyone made a helpful noise that was not forgiveness and was better.\n\nWhen it was Mara\u2019s turn to come up the crate because the City needs to use small, familiar bodies to trick itself into a sense of continuity, she did not recite three. She thought of doing it and then she remembered the way Bram had said the name of the woman who had tied a storm to itself and made weather sulk for a year, and she told them instead about unfastening and about the way saying yes and then no to the same seam makes a room feel like a courtroom. She told them about the bone and the notch and the rule she had learned before coffee, that you should not undo in pride what you did in fear and vice versa, and if you cannot tell which you did, you should wait with your hand on the table until you can. She said the word mercy aloud and did not apologize for it. They listened as they always listen when the thing is the size of their kitchen and not the size of a wall.\n\nAfter, while people formed a polite war to sign the charter without looking like exactly the sort of person who enjoys signing charters, Tamsin arrived with a coil of red thread fat as a cordial and wrapped it once around the leg of the table and once around her own wrist and twice around the bag of sugar, and she looked at Mara with a humor that came from living far from metaphor and said, \u201cWe went up to the far ledge and found a thing that is going to try to be a habit while we are busy with paper. There is a place where the seam would like to split itself and roll down like a rug toward the sea and become useful as a common path for men who carry loads too heavy for kindness. It is singing in thirds. That is the kind of singing stone does when it thinks about giving in. The sheep do not like it. If you can spare your scarred friend and your man with the chalk and your boy with the questions and that person with the pen who keeps saying deliverable as if it were holy, we would like to take them all up after soup and ask the seam to be unreasonable for a bit longer.\u201d\n\nSoup made the crowd consider themselves loved, which is the easiest way to get them to forgive the city for making them assemble in weather. Mara found the kettle at one end of the arcades like a defeated cannon and Corwin found ladles in a warehouse that had never before believed it contained anything the world would eat, and Laleh, whose expertise did not extend to broth, found an elderly man who had been waiting a long time to be asked to stir and let him tell everyone next to him how to make a stock without stock until they felt nourished by stories and not by vegetables. The soup had the taste of a compromise that had cooked long enough to be its own kind of food, and afterward the uphill exodus had the feel of a wedding procession no one had planned and everyone remembered from a dream.\n\nUp high, the seam sounded like a machine learning to be a person in an unsatisfactory novel and like a person learning to be a machine in the sort of poem people recite at wakes because it is easier than silence. The sheep stood in two lines that made a narrow corridor for air and a broad gate for meaning, and Tamsin\u2019s bell hung from a post and refused to ring out of loyalty to the kind of quiet the hill prefers. The place she had spoken of was a kink in the iron where the stone had learned men\u2019s weight as a dialect and was now tempted by the fluency of surrender. The kink tugged at itself, and the ground near it had taken to leaning, a slouch that invited hooves to make it worse. Bram closed one eye and held his stick like a tuning fork and the Public Safety woman drew a circle not on the ground this time but in the air with her hand, and Corwin\u2014who had not argued about coming because even a binder wants to be early for once when a page might change underneath his palm\u2014stood with his mouth closed on purpose and his pen nowhere near thought.\n\nMara did not put the stabler on the seam because the seam had not asked yet, and she did not tap the bone against the tool to remind it of their agreement because that would have been a performance and the iron disliked theater when it was in pain. She touched the kink and tried to be quiet in all the places Tamsin respected, and she felt the ask in it come reluctant and shy as a child who apologizes because someone taught it to, not because it understands. The iron did not want to be brave. It wanted to be congratulated for considering it. She had known men and women who were made of that. It made her tender to feel it in a seam.\n\n\u201cNot this,\u201d she said, the way you say to a cat about to make a mess of a guest\u2019s coat, but with more respect because the seam was older than cats and had been polite longer. \u201cNot this time. There is another path we can give the heavy men. Corwin, do you have rope. You always have rope. It is one of the ways you make it easy for us to forgive you.\u201d\n\nCorwin did not have rope because he never has exactly the thing he would be proudest to have, but he had forms with string and the string was stronger than it looks when it wants to prove a point, and Tamsin had thread that had remembered the weight of a hundred bells and therefore was arrogant enough to hold more. They lashed together a courtesy and slung it across a lower shelf of stone and made a way that was not the seam and would do for any man who could be persuaded he would get back down the hill alive if he obeyed a rule for as long as it took to sing a song. The seam eased in the way a child does when you replace a sweet with a story. Mara put the stabler to the air near the kink and closed it on nothing and listened to the sigh go out and come back like her breath after a hill she should not have climbed and felt the iron believe itself again in this place and be glad.\n\nOn the way down, the pretty son of the locksmith appeared from a ledge where he had obviously been practicing being older than his mother and he held out the saucer she had given him and showed her the groove. It was a handsome curve, too shallow to hold a sin and too bold to be ashamed of itself, and he had cut it with a patience she had only ever seen in gardeners and men who change their own minds. \u201cThey came back,\u201d he said in a rush that made his words step on each other like cousins, \u201cwith money and with a promise they did not intend to keep about using it to free doors that had been shut by people with unclean intent and I told them to eat a shoe. I returned the coin to the smallest one who had the kindest mouth and said I would carve him a handle instead that fit a door that fit a room that fit a table where he could stop thinking he had the right to walk in and tell other people to be rearranged. He did not like my speech, but the coin felt what it feels when it has done wrong and wanted to be in its own pocket and I let it.\u201d\n\nMara took the saucer and touched the groove and felt how the curve had turned the broken into art without teaching it any lies about utility. She wanted to say three things at once\u2014the first about pride, the second about safety, the third about a time when she had cut a line in a piece of paper because she could not find a notebook and how that line had turned into a week and a sea\u2014and so she said none and instead asked him if he would like to go down into the ring and hold a bell for an hour, because that was a way to make a boy feel seen without making him a hero, which is a rudeness.\n\nThe charter signing, when they did it after soup and after the hill had been persuaded to be boring again, had the ceremony of children promising not to peek on their birthdays. People lined the page with names that looked like fields and names that looked like law and names that looked like birds that would not live even into next spring, and they flourished their pens and they compromised their spelling and they made marks that would stand in for hands when hands were elsewhere, and Corwin endured it with patience that brought tears to a man nearby who had not expected to feel anything but the draft. The sheep were offered wreaths of thyme because no one can entirely resist improving nature with an herb, and they ate them because that is what you do when a human offers you food with sincerity, and then they left a pile of wool near the table and Tamsin took it and tied pieces to the wrists of the children who hung back and pretended not to mind.\n\nNight came with rain that had learned to find corners and be tender there, and in the dark a new wrong slipped along the edges of roofs with the particular silence of malice trying to make itself look like weather. There were men and women who had decided they did not care to read a charter and had learned very quickly where the bone\u2019s notch found its work, and they had nothing so decent as a tool to help them; they had fingers that had cut buttons from coats in markets and minds that had practiced being pleased by slack. They chose two corners, then six, then sixteen, and undid the holding Mara had done as if snapping thread and saying see, see, see, the seam only held because someone was watching. The city woke in the wrong places, at stairheads and at the backs of cupboards where the darkness should be lazy, and bells answered in disgust and then in horror, and by the time the Public Safety woman had men out with chalk and none of it doing any good because chalk is a sermon and you cannot preach to someone whose face is turned to the wall, the kettle in Mara\u2019s kitchen made the sound Tamsin had promised and made it twice because once would have been manners and tonight they needed something more like urgency.\n\nOut in the arcades Laleh lit a candle and held it under her chin until she looked like an idea everyone had had and not credited, and she told three boys to fetch sugar and three girls to bring string and she told a woman with a scar like a comma on her wrist to stand in the center of the square and be an object to gather around, and she sent a child who had learned to run without moving his shoulders too much to Bram\u2019s door with no words, and she went to Corwin and took his pen out of his hand and put it behind her ear so he would remember how to speak without writing first. Mara took the tool in one hand and the bone in the other and went where people had allowed the wrong to begin because the wrong is always more polite there and less energetic and therefore easier to embarrass.\n\nThe corners they had undone were the small domestic kind, the remedying sort that had kept a mat from sliding and a door from ever so slightly denying entry to a man who would later be thankful for the delay. She fixed two and refused a third and sweet-talked a fourth and found that her anger made the tool heavy and her sorrow made the bone kind. Bram arrived with his stick and a dog that had been a joke that morning and was a hero tonight and he put his body in a threshold and made it a corner by wanting something good very hard, and the wrong changed its mind about whether this was going to be easy and went across the square to find a different kind of slack. Corwin, who is always at his best an hour after he is forgiven, found a boy with chalk and taught him to draw a circle around the place where a door meets a wall so that when a hand touched it from the outside the chalk would tell it that hands are for holding and not for taking, and the boy glowed like a coal in a pocket.\n\nIt took until rain gave up and learned humility again. It took until the string across the square acquired knots the shape of excuses and the shape of prayers, and Laleh recorded neither because it is not the job of newspapers to make us look worse than we are when we will do that for ourselves by noon. It took until the child with the good running told Tamsin that the kettle had been telling secrets and Tamsin came with thread on both wrists and said names to the wrong that made it blush, because wrong has a body and it hates to be called old. They caught two of the people who had undone corners and discovered, once again, that villains are very boring in their particulars and very interesting in their reasons; one said they did it because they wanted the sheep to like us more if our corners were loose, and one said they did it because he hated doors that open when you push instead of when you pull. They were taken home by neighbors who had their names and who would not let them become the sort of men who belong to stories.\n\nIn the morning someone had chalked on Mara\u2019s stoop three questions that were not questions and looked like they had come from a school where pens were treated like we treat birds, with food and hands always the same temperature. It said: Who asked you to keep us. What will you do when the tool runs out. Who will unfasten you when you are the seam. She stepped over them because breakfast, and because if she did not eat she would answer the chalk and the chalk would be too pleased with itself and go write it at the corner near the bakery where children like to scuff and could not be trusted not to improve it with dragons. She boiled water and ate bread without butter again and put the wool Tamsin had tied to her wrist around the handle of the stabler and watched it look better when it was less certain of itself, which is a look she had admired in men and loathed in guns.\n\nThe note came from the coughing man before noon, folded the way a person folds when they apologize to a chair for bumping it with their hip, and it told her a thing that made her sit down without being taught by her knees first. There is a brother to a stabler, he wrote, and he drew a picture bad enough to be honest and good enough to be useful, and it had a jaw too, but its jaw closed the other way, and it did not sigh, it hissed, and it did not bind, it taught a thing how to forget how to be two when it had been two for good reasons. He called it a separator, which was a true name and a treacherous one, and he told her a man had been seen with one near the ring road seven years ago when a bridge had chosen not to fall until later and was persuaded to do now what it had planned to do after the feast, and that the man had not been seen again because sometimes a city, out of love, will seat a person in a chair and put a biscuit in their hand and wait with them until they forget why they had left the house at all.\n\nMara went to find Corwin because there are things you should not keep to yourself even if you can make a joke about saucers later, and she carried the letter and the bad picture and the bone inside her coat like she would a baby if she had ever had the chance to make that mistake, and she found him at the Council building not reading a petition but watching a crack in the stone as if it had written to him personally. He took the paper and did not pretend to be surprised because good officials practice their face until surprise is a private hobby, and he did the good thing he does sometimes which is not to speak until everyone else in the room has forgotten why they wanted to. \u201cWe will be asked,\u201d he said at last, \u201cto get one. Someone with donations and blue ink will think owning a separator makes us strong. We will be told it is for emergencies. We will be shown a wall with a door that should be open and an old woman who cannot get in because the door has swollen with weather and we will be told we are cruel if we do not use the hiss. I need you to tell me no.\u201d\n\nShe said no in three ways, because she knows a bureaucrat must take no like medicine and then like dessert and then like brandy if he is to be cured. She said no because there is a difference between removing a hand and removing a habit and only one keeps you from ever taking a hand again when it is offered. She said no because there are seams in men and women that should be allowed to keep their secrets even when they have been careless with the secrets of others. She said no because she loved him, which is to say she trusted him to tell her, later, when she was wrong, and to sit with her in a kitchen while the kettle admitted it had been wrong about itself again.\n\nThey put the charter up on the wall of the clay arcades and tied it with four woolen bands at the corners so it would be hard to pretend it had flown away by itself when the first westerly came, and Laleh ran her fingers along the edges as if teaching the paper to tolerate hands, and on the first night afterward the sea was quiet, the wolves were bored, the petition men went home and swept, and the sheep slept as if the iron had told them a bedtime story about a hill that had learned the trick of staying exactly the same through four different kinds of weather and had not been punished by a god for it. Mara washed two saucers because they had been out in the air and had collected a rumor and she is particular about rumor on plates, and she set the tool on the towel and told it something no one had asked her: You are not my life. You are a way my life is being useful and I will not forgive you if you try to become more than that. The tool was heavy and warm and pretended not to hear, which was an improvement in their conversations. Bram sat on her step and did not knock and combed the dog\u2019s ears with his fingers until the dog sighed in his sleep as if someone had tied a ribbon on a memory and put it back on the correct shelf.\n\nIn the days that followed the city learned to say endeavor as if it meant promise and to say mercy as if it meant arithmetic, which it does if you have ever counted someone\u2019s faults and found yourself better at math than you like. The bell fence caught three wrongs before breakfast one morning because wrong is always hungrier than we are, and Tamsin\u2019s thread tied itself into a phrase a girl could hum while sweeping, and the Public Safety woman developed a way to stand with her arms that made men with tools feel they were holding toys, which is a talent handed down from mothers to daughters when no one is watching. The pretty son of the locksmith made a key that opened nothing and he wore it around his neck and boys he used to be cousins with patted it and tried to ask without asking what it meant, and he told them it meant he could be relied upon not to open anything that had been closed with regret, and that sort of honesty does something to a neighborhood that paint cannot.\n\nThen, because ordinary is always brief even when you wish it were not, the kettle cried Tamsin\u2019s wrong with the note that meant hurry and politeness both, and the dog lifted his head because he had dreamed the cry at the seam and was glad to be asked for work by a sound he recognized, and Corwin appeared not at her door but at the corner because he had learned what corners to stand in when he did not want to be noticed by the wrong people, and Bram had the look of a man whose stick had said a Particular will show itself and if we do not greet it it will put a hat on and we will not recognize our own fortune when it knocks. The letter from the coughing man lay on the saucers like a promise someone else would have to keep, and Mara put the bone beside it and took the stabler in both hands and said aloud the quiet thing that lets a person walk into a version of their life that would once have frightened them: I will endeavor. I will keep some corners for the air. I will staple you to your good sense if you make me ask twice. I will ask someone to unfasten me when I am the seam. She said it without making a speech of it and the room believed her, and the city, which is nosy, heard.",

                              "content": "The summons carried that unnerving mixture of hurry and patience that meant the hill had noticed a wrong and the city was still deciding whether to be embarrassed by it. Mara stepped into the corridor with her coat already on because her hands had learned, in the last weeks, how to move before her mind wanted to admit she had decided, and she found Bram at the corner in that shepherd\u2019s half-shadow he made when he intended to usher a day toward a better ending. Corwin waited ten feet off with his pen put away and his attention out in front of him like a lantern, and the Public Safety woman\u2014who, it turned out, had a name after all and was irritated with herself for not having given it sooner\u2014Hesta, nodded as if she could make the morning bow to a sensible timetable with mere chin. Tamsin\u2019s thread flashed at her wrists like a pair of small, red thoughts. \u201cIt isn\u2019t wolves,\u201d Hesta said before anyone could poach her business with worse vocabulary. \u201cSomething is teaching the edges to be proud.\u201d\n\nThey followed the sound of bells thinking it over and turned under the brick arch by the Registry, where men who liked to be obeyed as a profession had kept maps on the walls so long that maps had learned a smell from the rooms. The wrong had come for the place where names are married to numbers and numbers persuade doors to behave, and it had been genial about it in the way a con is genial. House plates lay on the ground separated from their screws as if the two had been introduced at a dance and had mutually agreed that they were better off as acquaintances. A row of files leaned like men at a harbor rail and then leaned a little farther, and a clerk put his hand out to prevent a spill and his hand hovered half an inch from the paper without touching because he could not remember if he was allowed. On the wall where the city kept its sense of itself as a whole, the map had curled at the edges and made a noise like a drying leaf. The chalk circles Hesta had ordered drawn at the Registry\u2019s four corners had fallen open into parentheses and then into commas someone had removed from their sentences out of spite. \u201cNo,\u201d Bram said under his breath, not as spell but as courtesy, and the wrong breathed in his face, cool and smug, the way vinegar sits in a bowl and pretends to be a sauce.\n\nThe first hiss came invisible and traveled through the frame of the Registry door the way a rumor travels through a family: in the grain, humming, persuasive. A man stood just inside that door and held in his hand a tool that had not been made for kitchens or quarries or anyone who respected the difference between keeping and owning. It had a jaw, yes, but its jaw closed backward, as if it preferred to teach things how to come apart than to show them how to stay. It exhaled a thin thread of white that was not smoke and not steam and smelled faintly of lemon gone wrong. He was not what villains ought to look like; he had good shoes and a coat that had been brushed, and his hat had a ribbon a woman with taste had chosen. He looked like a man you would ask to sign a paper because you believed handwriting could be an antidote to mischief. \u201cSir,\u201d Corwin said, stepping forward with his open hands the way he did when he intended to hide his authority in his finger joints, \u201cyou will put that down and you will tell me your name and you will sit, and if you are lucky we will make tea and call this a misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nThe man smiled the way a person smiles when he has taught his face to pass for humility. \u201cIt is a misunderstanding,\u201d he said with the ease of someone who tells his own stories in court. \u201cI am separating error from habit. I am un-binding the city from the lies you bind it with. There is a law against fastening what should have been allowed to find its own shape. You have been busy with staples. Permit a correction.\u201d He pressed the jaw to the edge of the map\u2014just to the corner where the ring market made its round flirtation with the clay arcades\u2014and the hiss went out so quietly that a child coloring under a table would not have been startled, and the paper lifted its corner and decided it preferred to be a sheet. Mara felt her hand go to her pocket because there are gestures your body performs on your behalf when it senses that your thinking is about to be laggard.\n\n\u201cParticular,\u201d Bram said, and the word came out in him like an old cough he had learned to like because it signaled thinking, and the man\u2019s eyes slipped to him as if bothered to have been named so quickly. \u201cHe is not a wolf and not a bell. He is the argument that every field, seen from far enough, is a patchwork without stitches, and that stitches are an insult. He is here to teach us how to call each square of grass by a different surname.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t give your wrongs names in public,\u201d Hesta said, chalk poised. \u201cThey will come when called. Sir, I will ask again. Put your tool down. You are not city staff. You do not know how the Registry tolerates our bad habits. If you unfasten this map entirely, we will not remember which way the door is supposed to swing.\u201d\n\nThe man tilted the hiss\u2019s jaw toward a set of drawers that had been a coherent idea for three generations and exhaled. Two drawers eased away from the cabinet and let their labels slide loose so that the papers within became orphans of their own vocabulary. He took a step as if to test the floor for obedience and the floor, which had been good all morning, decided to become four planks instead of a surface. Mara saw fear on Corwin\u2019s face not because a stranger had brought a device into his Registry but because he had expected the day to be about signing and soup and now it was about asking people to agree to be one thing when they had been something else for a very long time.\n\nMara did not draw her tool like a sheriff, because the city would have laughed and that sort of laugh is hard to un-hear when you need to be obeyed. She took the stabler out and held it low and felt it turn in her grip the way a riverstone rolls in a palm to find the temperature of a hand it likes. The hiss turned its mouth toward her in a little mockery of friendliness, and the man holding it inclined his head as if greeting a colleague. \u201cYou have the twin,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have the lie. Put it away. Let this place unlearn its bad marriages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho taught you that word,\u201d Mara asked, feeling the bone-handled opener slide along the seam of her coat as if it would prefer to be first to the table if there were going to be lessons. \u201cWho told you the device hisses because it is righteous and not because it is bored. Do you know what happens when you separate more than you understand. You end up alone in a kitchen praising your own pantry for its independence.\u201d\n\nHe did not like the laughter that arrived at the edges of the Registry when she said that because it came from clerks who had not had the courage to laugh at him when he arrived. \u201cYou have fastened wolves to chalk circles,\u201d he said, hissing at the map again and making the markets flutter. \u201cYou have attached a chain to a promise as if promises appreciate hardware. You have stapled a man to a quay. I will not let you staple a city to your nervousness about change. There is a purer way.\u201d\n\nTamsin\u2019s thread knocked against itself on her wrist and made a small cadence that meant be less theatrical and more useful. \u201cSallying on about purity is how we broke half a hillside twenty years ago,\u201d she said, stepping past Hesta and putting herself between the man and the drawers he had freed. \u201cIron likes to remember. Paper likes to warm itself against other paper. Wool likes to keep certain things in the same place for a hundred winters. If you intend to be in this town after supper you are going to have to be less interested in clean lines and more interested in soup.\u201d\n\nMara set the stabler\u2019s jaw on the corner of the map where the hiss had taught it to flirt with separation and closed it. The sigh climbed the wall with the kind of patience you learn from upholsterers and from old women who mend quilts with their hands and their tongues held a certain way, and the paper laid itself back into its old compromise. The man with the hiss grinned and moved quickly to another corner because wrongs are happiest when they can keep you turning, and Hesta stepped where he stepped and left chalk on the floor in a curve that dissuaded the boards from thinking of themselves as planks, and Bram whistled low the way he does when he wants a flock to notice a dog from the corner of their vision and be pleased by the competence of dogs, and three clerks put their hands on the drawers and reminded them that names and numbers, mismatched as they are, can learn to be cousins.\n\nIt would have been a dance if it had not been an insult. The man lifted the hiss and taught a hinge to forget what it meant to be hinge, and Mara took the thrust of that forgetting and stapled it to a memory she found in the air, something the Registry had kept without filing: the sound of a baby being named by a grandmother who had not been asked permission. The hinge took the memory and stayed in its pocket. The man hissed at a line on the floor that had taught children where to wait when they practiced manners, and Tamsin bent and tied her thread to the line and to her own wrist and stood and made patience fashionable. The man hissed at the corner of a book where the City had once written down a list of streets that wanted new names, and Laleh, who had arrived breathless and furious that the Registry should get to have the news first, leaned on the book and scribbled two syllables in a margin and made the book laugh and therefore unwilling to be persuaded that paper prefers to be alone.\n\n\u201cWho sent you,\u201d Corwin asked the man during a moment when more than three people had their mouths closed at once. \u201cIf you say the Council you are a liar without imagination, and if you say my mother I will take you to her and she will separate your head from your reputation and give your reputation to a cat.\u201d\n\nThe man looked disappointed that he had not frightened anyone properly and satisfied that he had unfastened enough familiarity for breakfast. \u201cI was sent by the truth,\u201d he said, and Hesta, who is not given to pearls of any kind, rolled her eyes so emphatically that a girl across the room did it too out of admiration. \u201cThe truth that your corners are crutches. The truth that your bells are vanity. The truth that a seam is only a habit you have taught iron and iron should be allowed to dress itself in water if it likes. The truth that sheep are just wolves who were given good press. The truth that the world was meant to come apart gracefully and perhaps singing.\u201d\n\nBram made a noise she had not heard before, half laugh and half sorrow, and the wrong in the room ate it with relish. Mara felt, in the small bones across the back of her hand, the way the stabler bristled at the notion that it existed for lies. She felt, as a smaller and more treacherous feeling, the way that hiss made sense when pressed against a very particular kind of hurt: the sort that keeps a spoon next to a photograph on a windowsill and pretends the arrangement will hold back time. She found the bone with her other hand and slid its smile into the stabler\u2019s mouth and kept it there as if they might reassure each other, and then she did something she disliked: she spoke of herself in public. \u201cI know a separation that needed doing,\u201d she said, not looking at Bram because then she wouldn\u2019t say it. \u201cIt was a cough once. It had its own music and its own manners and we had taught it into our afternoons. I took it away, and a man was left with his breath and without his punctuation and he discovered that he needed to learn another kind of noise for his own door. You are not offering that kind of mercy. You are offering to unfasten anything that makes us feel obliged to each other. That is not truth. That is a loneliness you want company for.\u201d\n\nHe did not scowl because men like him never have scowled in public; they have learned better tricks. He hissed at the map\u2019s title, which was the name of the city in a hand that had known nothing of wolves and a great deal of rain, and the letters twitched because pride is vulnerable under certain lights. Mara lifted the stabler and closed it not on the paper this time but on the sound of Hesta\u2019s own name as it had been spoken a hundred times by men who did not mean it and a dozen times by women who did. She stapled that sound to the map\u2019s title and felt the paper settle as if countries, too, are relieved to be reminded of who they are by someone who calls them by their right diminutives. Hesta\u2019s mouth quirked to one side because she had not said thank you in a long time for anyone fastening her in a place she would have chosen.\n\nThey might have played the Registry like an organ until noon and perhaps the wrong would have gotten bored and left to find a wall to scold, but the man with the hiss did the one thing that changed the day into a story Mara would have to tell carefully if she did not want to make a habit of fear. He turned the device not on paper, not on wood, but on a woman\u2019s hand as it rested on the edge of the drawer she had learned as a young clerk with a ribbon in her hair. He fit the mouth around her thumb and drew down, and the jaw kissed the skin and exhaled, and the drawer forgot it had been hers for thirty years, and the woman forgot which side of the counter she belonged on, and the wrong discovered a new appetite in the room and wagged its tail. She swayed and looked at her hand like it had missed a step and taken her with it. \u201cNo,\u201d Mara said, and her voice had iron in it because you can talk stone into good behavior if you find the patient vowels, and she crossed the space as Hesta did and Tamsin did and Bram did, and for a second they were a fence.\n\nMara put the stabler\u2019s open jaw on the space between the woman\u2019s thumb and the drawer, not on flesh and not on wood but on the memory that lay there like an old penny, of having once cut that thumb on a paper edge and bled a little and licked the wound and finished writing anyway. She closed her hand and felt the sigh go into a tiny, polite place, and the drawer remembered it liked being touched by someone who kept it clean, and the woman remembered the drawer was hers for another year unless she said otherwise, and the wrong lost interest in that seam because it was not famous enough to bother with. Hesta took the woman\u2019s wrist and tied a thread that had already had a hundred wrists remember themselves with its help, and the woman sat in a chair like a throne and held her hand like a baby and whispered obscene things at the man with the hiss because there are obscenities that are as useful as prayers.\n\n\u201cEnough,\u201d Corwin said, and there was no pen in his hand and he had never sounded more like a citizen and less like an official. \u201cHesta, arrest him. Tamsin, if that device has a seam, you will show Mara where it is. Bram, if there is a whistle that makes a man reconsider his allegiance to romance, I would be obliged to hear it.\u201d He looked at the hiss with a hunger he did not pretend to have permission for and then looked at Mara and let the hunger turn into trust, which is the best trick he knows. \u201cDo not kill him. He is a person. Do not keep him. He is a person. Do not let him walk away with the city\u2019s vocabulary in his pocket.\u201d\n\nThe man did not run because he believed the allure of the clean unbinding would be enough to make them give him a corridor to leave by, and because he had moved through rooms like this in three other towns and been thanked afterward for the clarity he had provided when houses remembered they had stoves and did not need tables. Hesta did not reach for cuffs because there are moments when you must not confess to a wrong that it has the proportions of a crime; she reached for the woman\u2019s hand again and she reached for Mara\u2019s shoulder and she reached for the edge of the map, and in making those three gestures in one body she made a force that ignored the hiss and did not require it to be impressed.\n\nTamsin took the thread from her wrist and laid it along the mouth of the device without touching it, and the thread thrummed in a note Mara had begun to recognize as older than any Council. \u201cIt wants to learn a song,\u201d Tamsin said, amused in that furious way that makes children behave out of respect for a tone. \u201cIf you teach it a song, it will have to sing it before it can hiss again and the song will take time and we have time enough to be wise if we are not greedy. It has learned only one tune. It thinks it is an art to undo what is badly done even when the thing that was badly done has learned, from being badly done, to be useful.\u201d\n\nBram whistled something like the old morning call to lambs that had pulled their heads out of their mothers\u2019 flanks and were uncertain about being persons, and the hiss quivered and adjusted its mouth because a device that exists to teach a thing how to leave home is romantically susceptible to any tone that promises it could be part of a flock. Mara did a foolish thing and she will be forgiven later or she will not; she put the stabler and the bone together and bit down on the rim of the hiss\u2019s jaw with her own tool and pressed with a patient impertinence until the sigh laid itself across the hiss like a blanket and flattened it and took away its cleverness for the length of one breath. In that breath Hesta\u2019s hand came down not with a cuff but with a strip of leather she had used once to tie a door open at a birth, and she wrapped it around the hiss and the man\u2019s wrist and made them each other\u2019s problem.\n\nHe looked more frightened by that than by the threat of law. \u201cYou cannot tether me to my device,\u201d he said, which was the truest thing he had said since he came, and Tamsin smiled like a woman who knows ten different names for weather and the way each makes the bread rise. \u201cOh, we can,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have been telling it what you are for a week. Let it tell you. Let it ask you whether it really wanted to separate a woman\u2019s hand from her work. Let it hiss at your knuckles until you hear yourself. It will not hurt. It will be worse than pain. It will be instructive.\u201d\n\nHesta took him, not to a cell but to a chair in the corridor where a draft sits out its days, and set the chair in a circle she drew on the floor at knees and ankles and wrists because circles do their best thinking when they can find elbows to lean on, and she told him not to move and he did not because the hiss had become heavy in his hand with all the unfastenings he had asked of it and was asking if he might like some of his own seams untidied for a change. Corwin sat on the corner of the Registry table like a boy and rubbed his eyes with the heel of a hand that had not learned to tolerate tears and said, \u201cWe will not have one of those in this city. I do not care if they send me six letters with seals on them that cost a goat each. Put the word out: if you see a hiss, call it by its bad name, which is Separator, and if the man holding it looks like the kind of person who asks for more rope than he needs, send him to me and I will put him in a chair with Hesta\u2019s circles and we will give him soup until his device chooses to refuse him.\u201d\n\nMara put the map back and smoothed its corners and put her hand on the place where her part of town lay, a smudge of streets and courtyards and the small, obstinate lines people call lives. The stabler was warm, very warm, and the bone had that smug temperature that says somebody has learned something at last. She leaned against the edge of the table and felt all of her ages in her back, and Bram leaned next to her in the way of men who would like to be a stick but have been given the burden of skin, and they watched as the Registry remembered how to be one room and not several.\n\nThey had a day and a half after that when nothing resorted to devices but everything had the hum that follows a public wrong the way bees hang around a shirt that once smelled of honey. The city behaved with a politeness that felt like exhaustion and remembered how to salt its soup and share its weather and take notes. The sheep did the extraordinary thing of making no special arrangements at the bell fence, which oddly reassured everyone more than if they had lined up and performed; they pressed their ears to iron and to earth, not to listen for wolves this time but to listen for the thing that comes after a hiss has been in a room and left its opinion on the chairs.\n\nAt twilight on the second day, someone knocked on Mara\u2019s door without knocking, which is to say the house knew who was at the threshold and opened itself a little out of habit. The man with the cough stood in the hallway, hat in hand, hat in the sense of humility and hat in the sense of the actual object, and his face had that look of having been re-arranged by air and regret and coming willingly to be admitted to the number of the living. He did not look like a wizard because there are no wizards; he looked like a person who had been too proud of his hands and had gone to a hill to be scolded, and the hill had been efficient. \u201cYou may hit me,\u201d he said without preamble that would have flattered him, \u201cfor sending you a thing without a letter with more verbs in it, and you may feed me, and I will accept whichever you choose as the correct order.\u201d\n\nShe did neither at once. She pointed at the sink where the stabler lay and at the table where the bone and the letter and the wool were piled in that particular geometry that arises when you live alone and love too many objects. He put his hat down and his cough behaved in a way that told her he had made peace with his throat and its desire to have its own punctuation. \u201cIt is more beautiful than I remembered,\u201d he said, which is always the right thing to say about a tool. \u201cIt gets that sheen when it has been used for what it was meant for. If you had been cruel with it, it would be duller and you would be thinner and your eyes would be worse at noticing rooms.\u201d\n\nBram arrived two heartbeats later because you cannot keep him away from a narrative he has been wishing for in private. Corwin followed because whenever someone says they have brought the past into a kitchen he needs to write down at least two adjectives about it in case the Council asks for a memo. Hesta leaned in the doorway and let her presence be the polite threat it was, and Tamsin tied her thread to the back of a chair and pretended she had come to look at a plant. Laleh arrived with a notebook and a mouth that promised she would not write anything down that could be used against a woman in a decade by a man who likes shoes.\n\n\u201cYou called it a stabler,\u201d the man said to the room in which the city had collected in less time than it takes a kettle to lie. \u201cMy accent makes a hash of the old word. It is a person, in the language my grandfather tried to keep and my father was not invited to use in the army. It stabils. It keeps the nights together when the day has broken them. It binds that which will be bound, not in perpetuity but until morning can be brave again. Its brother, which you met today, is not men\u2019s work. It is a thing made for surgical winters, for the moment before two mountains decide to rip a river open and the people in the valley must be given a chance to move out of the way. We are not to hold it. We are not to hand it to men who love gates. I was wrong to keep it in a drawer when the city had its breath knocked out. I was wronger still to give you no rules when I handed it over. That is my cough, you see, in your kitchen. I want it to sound at the correct times.\u201d\n\nHesta snorted once because she has no patience for men who make poetry their apology, and then nodded once because she has a great deal of patience for men who bring their mistakes to her like cats. \u201cWe have made rules,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will approve of some and jeer at others. We will ignore your jeering. We will let you improve our rules when it saves us humiliation. Your separator friend is in a chair with a device tied to his hand until he remembers that devices do not absolve you of knowing what you are for. We will take soup to him at irregular intervals so he will not make a religion of bell times. The map is reattached. The Registry is one room. There are corners for the air. Thank you, for the metal. You may take one of the saucers when you leave if you like. We have many.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t send the other one,\u201d he said, contrition making him eloquent by accident. \u201cIt belongs to a different archive, one that does its thinking in houses and not in hills. They took it away from us in a winter when we had less bread and more argument. A group that named itself after roads acquired it and decided to call it a truth-tongue. They walked around teaching furniture that it had no obligation to be helpful. They like men who think about bridges more than people who cross them. You will see them, if you are not careful, looking at your chain down at the harbor like it is mispronouncing their God.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late,\u201d Corwin said, more gently than his words, because he had the grace to be tired. \u201cWe have seen them. We have combed their hair with the wrist of one of our own. We have fed them. They will think themselves persecuted for a week and then they will attach themselves to an argument about the width of the bell fence and leave us alone until they discover that bells are better in their mouths than on strings. Tell me something useful, sir, and I will give you a page on letterhead to write it on so that your language can regret it in comfort.\u201d\n\nThe coughing man nodded at the tool in the sink and then at the bone and then at Mara\u2019s hands. \u201cYou cannot keep it, not in the way you keep saucers,\u201d he said, and heartbreakingly for a childish second she felt the petulance of a girl told she must share. \u201cYou will have to make more than one person able to hear it ask. Tamsin can, and she knows better than to want to. The shepherd can, because his stick taught him when to be an interruption humbly. The chalk woman can, because circles listen for a living. The pen man can if he sits in a room with no paper and learns to speak in the old way, which is to listen without composing his answer in advance. You cannot be the only hinge. It will break you and you will embarrass it, and we will have to take it away and no one will be as good with it, and the city will decide to be as proud as a cliff and we will fall off.\u201d\n\nHe had a way of making sense and insulting you at the same time, which was exactly the sort of man who ought to live far from friends and close to sheep. Mara looked at her hands and saw in them what every woman sees at a certain hour if she is unlucky and working: the smallness of them against jobs which are not small. She could hear the kettle and the bell at the seam and the child in the arcades drawing a circle around his own feet and declaring himself under obligation to no one for the duration of the figure, and she knew, with the sort of conviction she had always suspected was a trap, that if she died tonight the city would keep breathing, which is almost a kindness. \u201cTeach us,\u201d she said to the man, and his cough behaved in the gap as if it approved of her sequence. \u201cTeach us what a no sounds like to metal. Teach us when to refuse an unfastening. Teach Corwin how to listen without planning a committee. Teach Hesta how to leave three corners when her instincts want four. Teach Bram how to let someone else whistle when his throat is proud. Teach Tamsin how to tie the air when we are not looking. Teach Laleh what not to write.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will do none of that,\u201d Laleh said dryly, but she smiled around the it and that softened all the edges. \u201cOr you will, and I will pretend to disapprove in public, and then I will go home and write a sentence that sounds like a person standing on their stoop after a storm and will hand that to the morning men and they will read it and make better coffee.\u201d\n\nThey did not, of course, all learn at once, because the hill does not give lessons to crowds. The coughing man showed them that the stabler\u2019s jaw will not close on a seam taught by contempt and that the bone will not release a holding made by tenderness. He taught Corwin to put his hand on the table and count to nine without numbers, which was comical and humiliating and left Corwin a better listener with a chafed pride. He let Hesta scold the device and watched the way it enjoyed being shouted at and then sulked if shouted at for too long, and told her that she must be careful not to become its mother. He made Bram hold the stabler and whistle to himself alone, and Bram forgot to be world-important for the duration and afterward looked embarrassed and rested. He made Tamsin open her hands, and the thread went bright and sulked and made a note in the air that meant, fine, our work is shared, if it must be. He did not try to teach Laleh anything because he was not foolish, but he let her observe the way the sigh did its work and the way a hiss looks for weather that can be blamed, and she wrote three neat lines across the top of a page and then folded it and would read them to nobody for a week.\n\nWhen the lesson had gone long enough to convince the tool that it had not been co-opted into a school, the kettle cried, and in that awkward opening between instruction and tea the letter in Mara\u2019s saucers fell over and showed its last sentence, which she had not noticed because she has wit enough to avoid endings when she can. The line said: Do not staple your grief to the day. Do not staple your dear to the corner where he once stood. He is gone into a place with no seams and will be angry if you teach that place tricks. She put her hand over it with a movement more protective than ashamed, and Bram saw and did the polite thing and looked away, and then did the impolite thing that constitutes friendship and put his hand over hers on the paper. The bone in the sink knocked its tooth against the metal of the stabler once, like a spoon telling a glass it had loved it very long and would prefer not to have to say so.\n\nDown at the Registry, the man with the separator sat in Hesta\u2019s circle and discovered what it feels like to be the seam in a story, and he learned to sneeze at his own device when it tried to teach his fingerprints to be less loyal. The sheep took earsful of iron\u2019s bedtime story and did not tell anyone because some kindnesses lie better in wool. The bell fence found a new note that meant we are not meant to hold this one, this wrong, this next thing that will come with more rhetoric and better shoes. The harbor chain dreamed of being a river and woke embarrassed. The chalk circles around children\u2019s feet smudged with play and the children remembered that chores are a species of magic if done with ridiculous seriousness. And the city, which had been stapled and unfastened and advised and chalked and scolded and fed and defended and asked to behave itself in more ornate ways than any object should have to endure, took a deep breath and let it out, with the sigh of a seam finding itself in a garment made of neighborhoods and thresholds and men who could be taught and women who had always known.\n\nNight was not done with them. It never is. Hesta came to the door of Mara\u2019s kitchen after the washing up and leaned as if she had been placed there by a stagehand in a competent play and said, with an expression that made even Tamsin sit up and place her thread down like a good knife, \u201cThey are unfastening marriages.\u201d She let the sentence sit long enough to learn to be heavy and then added the only amendment it needed. \u201cThey are doing it with words and with the hiss where words fail them. They are calling it mercy. They are calling it clean. People are thanking them in the way you thank someone on your step when your hands are still wet from the sink. I will need circles and thread and your metal, but mostly I will need the parts of you that look like the inside of your kitchen, because this is that kind of wrong.\u201d\n\nMara looked at the letter and took her hand away from it because if the day had taught her anything it was that hiding is overrated as a strategy. She took the stabler, which had been prepared for this conversation before she, the stubborn one, was, and the bone, which had an opinion about vows that had been made under weather, and the wool, which had gotten a little drunk on its new habit of being useful. Bram took his stick and knocked its end gently on the floor as if to remind it that it can be asked to be kind and to be sorry afterward, and Corwin gathered his pages because he keeps his courage in them and then pretends to have left it elsewhere when heroism would be flattering, and Tamsin tied her thread to a wrist she had never expected to see such work, and Laleh took the candle because people like candles when they intend to tell the truth to themselves in rooms they did not choose.\n\nThe first house had tea on the table because grief cannot resist the practical, and the husband stood in the doorway because he had rehearsed that posture for this speech and would not be robbed of it. The wife held a cup too hot and did not care and had that look of a woman who would prefer to be made to hate someone publicly rather than to be obliged to love them privately after he had left. The man with the hiss was not there; his cousin was, the idea he had brought to town walking in other shoes. It had no device and did not need one. It had sentences men had learned from books and excuses women had learned from their mothers and little bits of neon from the market that had gotten tangled in vows on the way home, throwing sparks. It had mercy in its hand; it was prepared to be thanked. Mara stepped over the threshold and made the wrong remember it was in a corner. She placed the stabler not on the ring of a finger nor on the laces of a shoe but on the patience in the room, the part of the air that holds the words like a basket when people are trying to tell the truth without showing off. She fastened patience to time and it made a little sound like a kiss given to a forehead because there was soup to be offered and a child in the next room who had to be convinced the world wasn\u2019t changing, only the furniture. \u201cSay it,\u201d she told the man, not unkindly. \u201cSay your needing. Do not call it clean. Do not call it mercy. Say the small, bad part first, the ridiculous part about how you cannot bear to see your own hair in the basin because it reminds you of how your father left everything undone and you learned to leave because it felt like agency. Then say the part about the woman you met in the counting house. Then tell her you do not know if you will be cruel or decent in a year. Then wait while she decides if the corner is where she still wants to live.\u201d\n\nThe wrong did not know where to stand in that protocol. It tried to hiss and failed and tried to stand taller and shrank and remembered that certain corners have heard babies cry and that makes them disinclined to be lectured by ideas. Tamsin tied red thread to the chair backs and to the tea pot because the act of pouring is older than most separations and teaches a hand to measure without thinking it\u2019s doing math. Bram put his stick under his arm and waited in the way of men who understand that waiting is sometimes shepherding, and Corwin looked at his pages and did not turn any, which is the most radical thing a man like him can do in a room. Hesta stood, and the house learned to brace itself without turning its boards into a wall. Laleh did not write because the room would have hated it. The wife drank the tea and set it down and said her small, bad thing first: about how she hated the way his boots sounded because it meant the day would begin before she had chosen a hat, and then said the name of the woman he had met, and then said, in the voice you forgive people anything for, \u201cI will not have you called clean. I will have you called kind, if I can manage it. I will have my corner. I will have my bell. I will have my breath. Go, then, but do not let the wrong call you by your new name.\u201d\n\nThey went to nine houses because three is polite and six is thorough and nine is the number you use when you intend to be tired and still be moral. They stapled patience to rooms and they unfastened old bindings that had been taught by vanity, and Mara used the bone on three marriages that had done the courageous thing earlier than either of the people in them had known how to name, and freed them, and later she cried in her kitchen until the dog put his nose on her knee and then she cried more because she remembered a nose she used to know. They told two men with devices to take their hissing out into a field where sheep would look at them until they changed their minds. They told one woman that if she ever, ever called a clean separation mercy in front of Tamsin again she would be tied to a post and made to listen to bells all afternoon until she cried from boredom. They drew circles around a bed and did not cross them because certain unfastenings should be done in private and not by neighbors, and Hesta stood guard outside and frightened away three gossips with the set of her shoulders.\n\nThey did not finish. You cannot. The city is a garment that fits badly even on its good days, and there are hems upon hems and somebody\u2019s grandmother sewed a line no one can cut without unmaking a story. They went home when the kettle sounded tired and the bell fence picked at its own tune out of boredom, and they sat in Mara\u2019s kitchen and ate bread without butter and that made Corwin announce he would bring butter next time, and Laleh wrote one line on a page and tore it off and burned it because it was too satisfying, and Hesta hung her chalk from a nail and told it to sleep, and Tamsin tied her thread to the back of a chair and asked it to dream true, and Bram put his stick across his knees the way a man lays a dog\u2019s head there and they rested together. The stabler lay on the towel and steamed a very little as if pleased, and the bone smiled because it had learned four new things about mercy and one about vanity, and the letter in the saucers pressed itself flat to the porcelain because it had told her its last useful line and wanted to be allowed to become a napkin for a morning with jam.\n\nWhen she finally slept, Mara dreamed of corners that had tidied themselves into plenitude instead of judgment, and of chalk lines that did not scold but reminded, and of bells that rang because they were tired of being quiet and not because anyone was in danger. In the dream, the sea put its hand on the harbor chain and patted it like a relative who has run out of interesting stories and has learned to listen, and sheep stood with their ears at a peculiar angle as if the iron were telling them a joke it had misremembered, and wolves lay on their backs in the chalk circles Angelo had drawn around them and confessed to the night that they were bored. She woke with the taste of lemons in her mouth, but the good kind, and went to the sink to find her tool exactly where it should be, and the sun in the window came through in a square, which, despite the fashion, pleased her.",
