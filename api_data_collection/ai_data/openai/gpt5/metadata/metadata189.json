     "novel_text": "They say Lincoln sleeps beneath its own cathedral, that the hill itself dreams in stone. On certain mornings, when mist stripes the Witham and gulls wheel in lazy, fish-eyed spirals over the Brayford Pool, the whole city feels submerged, like a bell lowered into water. Sound changes. Light edges around a corner and won\u2019t cross a line. People walk faster without knowing why. It\u2019s a habit the place has, cropping up like moss on Roman walls: to pretend everything is ordinary until it isn\u2019t.\n\nThere are streets I know by muscle and breath. Steep Hill with its sugared windows, chocolate shops and blue-painted doors; the crooked turn where a butcher keeps sawdust in buckets and bones strung up like wind chimes; the tight little alley that could be a trick of the eye unless you look down and notice that the bricks are wrong and the light there has a tinnitus hum. Some of those streets are true. Some are only openings that look like streets from an angle. The city and I have a working arrangement. We keep each other\u2019s secrets.\n\nI go by Silas to most, unless the day is serious and the river runs glassy. Then I remember my full name, Silas March, and say it to the dark as if it\u2019s a kind of key. A worlock, if you like \u2013 I\u2019m not precious about spelling. The old women on Burton Road call me hedge-witch and wink. The students call me a street magician and would probably film me for an app if I let them. There\u2019s a man at the Oxfam bookstore who taps the counter when I set down coin and says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the hands for it.\u201d I don\u2019t argue. I\u2019ve got the hands.\n\nThe work is mostly small. Needles threaded without looking. A coin sewn into the lining of a coat to see if it turns black by morning and whether the wife will stop dreaming about crows. A back garden where nothing will grow because a broken mirror sits at the root of a hawthorn, feeding it shine and fever. I\u2019ll trace a circle with salt and river sand, knock four times on the paving, cough, spit. Plants will be plants again. The man will make me tea that never quite warms.\n\nOn Tuesdays I visit the Cathedral, though I never go in by the front. A side door, a key that is not a key, a stone worn by fingers that are not remembered by any living keeper. It\u2019s an understanding I have with the place. We acknowledge each other\u2019s age without counting. The air inside is the kind that makes you apologize for breathing, all honey-lit and high and full of psalms. I sit under the misericords and listen for the unquiet. It is rarely the grand, gilded things who have something to say. It\u2019s usually a splinter of wood, a scrap of lead, a feather stuck in a crack, or the memory of boots at night when war made the glass rattle.\n\nOn a Tuesday in late October, the bells did not ring the hour. There was a tremor in the stone you could mistake for your own pulse if you didn\u2019t know any better, and a draft from the north door even though the wind was sleeping in the crows. I walked the nave, counting but not counting, fingertips grazing air. Behind the lectern a child\u2019s marble was lodged in a gutter of shadow where no child would have reason or height to leave it. Blue glass. It ticked under my nail like a watch and whispered three syllables that meant falling. I stood very still and didn\u2019t breathe. The syllables went away.\n\nAfterward I went to see Nan Pearce because if there\u2019s one person who won\u2019t let a whisper go without giving it a coat and hat, it is Nan. She lives in a terrace by the Stonebow where the curtains are always shut halfway, as if drawing breath. There\u2019s a cat that never blinks and a cactus that has not moved in eleven years. Nan sees me coming and says, \u201cYou smelled the bells,\u201d as if I\u2019d put the bells in my pocket.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ring,\u201d I tell her.\n\n\u201cThey rang where they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat did the building say?\u201d She doesn\u2019t ask what the Cathedral said, mind you. Nan knows buildings like some people know their children\u2019s sleeping breaths.\n\n\u201cThree beats,\u201d I say. \u201cNot the hour. Not the day. Not the smoke alarm either.\u201d\n\nNan pours tea into mugs whose handles have been glued back on three times. She has a superstition about throwing a mug away: she says the house keeps count. \u201cSomething\u2019s waking on the long lines,\u201d she says. \u201cYou heard it. My cat woke at five-fifteen and shouted at his bowl as if the ocean was in it. The kettle boiled cold. The jam set twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found a marble,\u201d I say. \u201cBlue. It didn\u2019t want to be touched. It said falling.\u201d I set it down on the table. It rolls away from my hand, obedient to laws I do not name, and comes to rest against a sugar bowl as if hiding its face.\n\nNan looks not at the marble but the shadow it makes and nods with the softness she reserves for broken things. \u201cOne of his, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose?\u201d\n\nShe looks at me like I\u2019m a slow boy pretending to be a man. \u201cYou\u2019ve been smelling feathers for a week. Don\u2019t pretend. The Wren\u2019s boy. Wren\u2019s wrong boy.\u201d She shakes her fingers as if plucking cobwebs. \u201cRook.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook?\u201d The word tastes like burnt toast, black grease. \u201cYou\u2019re certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do certain. He\u2019s been wetting the edges again. You know how some men paint fences to make them look new? He\u2019s painting nights. The kind that attract things with numbers in their bones.\u201d She taps the marble. It makes the faintest sound of a bell ring backwards. \u201cHe wants the whole of it to fall, you understand? None of this messing about with cities and starlings, he wants the planet to go down like a rotten apple.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d I say, and the words are thin, brittle like child\u2019s toys. \u201cThe lines\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lines fray. The knots come loose. You saw a knot today looking like a marble. You think what happens when a proper knot goes? Cracks through fields you never walked. Rivers wearing new mouths. Gravity getting a stammer.\u201d She leans in. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell me he can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook was bound,\u201d I say. \u201cCovens made sure of it. The east ring, the north ring, the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you that? Men who like the shape of their lies? He was bound to the last Keeper of the Moor Gate and you know as well as I do she went to the sea with stones in her pockets. No one held the rope when she went. No one tied it to a good place. Rook learned something in the slack. I can feel him stepping on my floorboards without opening my door.\u201d\n\nI keep my face still. I have learned to keep it all still: the breath, the eyes, the pulse at the throat. It\u2019s a trick. The kind a worlock learns in a world that wants to count you. \u201cIf he\u2019s here, he\u2019s not here for me,\u201d I say.\n\nNan Pearce laughs a low laugh that makes the cat\u2019s ear twist. \u201cEveryone who has ever wanted to bring a world down has had to step through Lincoln like a gentleman who left his gloves on a pew. He won\u2019t mind you until you mind him. What did the Cathedral do when you touched the marble?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt moved,\u201d I admit. \u201cNot like a wave. Something more like... a shiver. And someone walked past and didn\u2019t see me there.\u201d The words leave a taste, iron-ish. It would be easier if I could call it a trick of light, a draught. It would be easier still to call it nothing. \u201cThey brushed my shoulder. But. Maybe it wasn\u2019t my shoulder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere now,\u201d Nan murmurs, and it is not pity. It is another of her soft things, wrapped round something with teeth. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring that look into my kitchen without eating something. Toast?\u201d\n\nI say yes because saying no would make a noise I don\u2019t want to hear. While she rattles plates, I turn the marble between my fingers. It is the kind of blue that makes sailors promise things to stars. Every now and then, just at the edge of the iris, there is a fleck of gold, a flaw stitched hurriedly. When I hold it to my ear I hear in it the sound of a long fall into a dry place. In my head: an image of a ladder down through a well so deep the bottom has been waiting longer than memory. It is a particular kind of fear. The fear of not what is down there, but the certainty that down there is all of us, eventually.\n\nNan hands me toast with jam that glows as if it remembers sun. \u201cHe\u2019ll come careful,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019ll send runts and kind hearts and letters with no stamps. He\u2019ll send a boy who used to sit in pew three and whistle in his coat sleeve. He\u2019ll send whatever bit of the edge he can find to cut you with. Don\u2019t go to the waterside at night, Silas. Not till the bell fancies ringing properly again.\u201d\n\nI nod as if I mean it. I intend to mean it. But the Brayford at night is where the city\u2019s sleep troubles leak into the open, and that\u2019s where I go when a day makes me too tight in the shoulders. I walk, I listen to the lap of black water, I watch the swans like lost coats, I think about the miracles we have and the ones we are refused.\n\nThat night, the waterside smells wrong. Not of diesel and chip fat and the faint sugar of spilled cider, but of hot tin and rain on summer stone. A smell from another season. The lights are haloes. The swans do not sleep; they stand tall and still, necks like questions. A girl on the steps stares at her phone but does not touch the screen. I count her breaths unconsciously. She smells of clove and shampoo. There is a ring of salt around the penny she is turning with her shoe, which she did not draw. Good instincts, bad advice.\n\n\u201cYou can go home,\u201d I say to her without looking. \u201cWhatever you came to watch won\u2019t show you its good side tonight.\u201d\n\nHer head lifts slow, as if the night had to give it back. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who tells you when the river\u2019s in a state,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd tonight it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk to strangers,\u201d she says, but she stands up, her hand going to her pocket to check something is still there. A key? A stone? A name. \u201cMy mother said never to sit with my back to water.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother is wise,\u201d I say. \u201cDoes she know you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the kind of mother who knows where I am,\u201d she says, and she smiles. The smile is not a child\u2019s. She has learned some things, and she has not learned others. \u201cBesides,\u201d she adds, \u201cI like the noises. Not the water. The... other ones.\u201d Her head cocks, listening. \u201cYou hear them too, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nPeople say this to me often enough that I have an answer that is true and unhelpful. \u201cSometimes. How about we make a bargain? You go home tonight and don\u2019t come to the water again without leaving a copper coin under your left shoe before you step out the door. If the coin is cold when you pick it up again on your way back, you go back inside and make a cup of tea. If the tea tastes of pennies, you salt your doorstep and telephone your friend whom you haven\u2019t called for three months. Then you go to bed and dream about sheep.\u201d\n\nShe blinks, then laughs into her scarf. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says, surprising me by meaning it. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dream,\u201d I say, which is true in the way a knife is true.\n\nShe leaves. I watch her go, stepping firm, the penny forgotten only to be remembered and snatched up on instinct just in time to keep the trick from filing itself away under Bad Luck. When she is gone I stand still and listen to the river come to attention. The water stills. A wind walks along the surface in bare feet. Somewhere very far away a door closes and stops the breath of a room. Another opens. It is all a kind of math that pretends to be a story. Add one. Take away ten. Divide the dark by its own appetite. See what\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d says a man beside me.\n\nHe is not there until he is there. Black coat, the kind that tries hard, the kind that eats light at the cuffs. His hair is the peeled edge of a crow\u2019s feather. He stands too close, in the scissored way some men do who are used to seeing their reflections flinch. His eyes are not remarkable until you want to look elsewhere and can\u2019t. He smells faintly of chalk. His hands are bare.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t coming,\u201d I say.\n\nHe smiles that small smile that belongs to a boy who set fire to a field of barley and got away with it because his father\u2019s brother owns the village. \u201cEveryone comes down to the water,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cIt\u2019s why our cities get built where they get built. The old urge to drink. Or drown. Or wash. All the same urge. The earth curling up a palm full of what we already are.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook,\u201d I say.\n\nHe inclines his head, corrects me with a little bow made of bones. \u201cMr. Rook. For the niceties. And you are Mr. March. You prefer Silas. You have hands like a promise and you carry your dead like rosary beads. Charming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you out in it,\u201d I say. \u201cThe night. You use softer things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe night is soft,\u201d he says, and for a moment there is something tired in it, something old, and something like grief hidden where it cannot be stolen. \u201cIt is people who are hard. They crack the edges. They insist on corners. The night gives them none, and so they call it cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want.\u201d\n\nHe steps back as if the question has weight. \u201cOh, a little of this. A little of that. Balance. Tilt. Sky music. It\u2019s all one thing. I want to see what happens if a line we have all assumed is seed turns out to be fuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you want. You want to bring the world down. Your name has hungry in it.\u201d\n\nHe smiles again. He would be handsome if the light hadn\u2019t learned to be careful around him. \u201cDown is a matter of perspective. There are people in the south who will tell you that north is down; in the east, they say the same of west. I want to bring the planet into a new alignment for a while. Tilt it. Let the oceans remember a different shape. Let the wolves hear the dead walking. Let the stones finally speak. You can call that down, if you\u2019re fond of your current furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll kill everyone,\u201d I say, but I do not raise my voice. We are not men who raise our voices at the river.\n\nHe flutters his fingers in a little shamefaced nothing. \u201cWe always say that. Whenever anything changes. And sometimes it\u2019s true. Very often it\u2019s not. People are stubborn. Hard to shake. Hard to shift. That\u2019s why you have to change the whole machine if you want to change the cogs. You\u2019ve been patching the cogs, Silas. Bless you for it. You\u2019ve been mending little holes with little thread and keeping old women from nightmares and young boys from staying too long under the bridge. And that\u2019s lovely. Truly. But the fabric is rotten. It wants to be something else. I\u2019m just going to give it its head.\u201d\n\nHe is so reasonable that I have to look away. The swans are listening, heads cocked, eyes like black beads. I say, \u201cYou know I won\u2019t let you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, pleased. \u201cYou are the city\u2019s worlock. A little prophet with dirt under his nails. Destined. It\u2019s my favorite word. I know what they\u2019ve always said of you. The candle the Cathedral kept under the poor box. The boy who walked out of an empty house with the river on his tongue and a dead bird in his pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it.\u201d My throat feels thick.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in your pocket tonight?\u201d he asks, because he likes to be cruel in little ways. He leans in. \u201cIs it one of mine?\u201d He makes a little grasping gesture toward the marble. The blue inside hardens. He closes his fingers around air, then opens them, disappointed. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hold it that way,\u201d he remarks. \u201cIt will make your hand forget how to hold anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it,\u201d I say, and it is not about the marble. It is about everything else demarcated by that line. \u201cStay out of Lincoln, Rook. Go hurt your own people.\u201d\n\nHe steps neatly around that. \u201cI\u2019ll come and go as I like. But I won\u2019t touch your little houses, not yet. I wanted to see you. To look at the man everyone believes in. So ordinary. Tall enough to reach the bell rope. A little of the river about you. So much of the north wind under your collar.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me why you\u2019re telling me,\u201d I say. \u201cYou could have done what you came to do without this conversation. You like to talk, but you don\u2019t usually do it yourself.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me then with a very gentle, very private kindness that makes me colder than the river could. \u201cI came to be polite,\u201d he says. \u201cI came because I do not want to make you frightened more than I have to be. I came because you\u2019re going to try to stop me and you won\u2019t be able to and it will hurt you and I wanted to give you this, a small thing, a courtesy. I like courtesies. We use them doormen. They open and close the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour courtesy is filthy,\u201d I say.\n\nHe nods, unoffended. \u201cIt is. But it is still a courtesy. Don\u2019t go up to the Cathedral for a few days. The stone does not want to be stepped on and your weight is not what you think it is. Tell Nan Pearce to put her hand on the chimney and count to nine and go to bed. He\u2019s listening down chimneys this week. Tell the girl with clove breath to put salt in her pocket and walk a different street. Tell the old man with the broken shoe that his shoe is not why he limps.\u201d\n\nI open my mouth to ask him how he knows, and he smiles because it is the question he wanted me to ask. \u201cI know because I do not lie to myself about what things are for,\u201d he says. \u201cI am excellent at finding the applied meaning of objects. Shoes, chimneys, girls\u2019 pockets. Worlds.\u201d\n\nHe goes then. He does not step into a shadow and vanish. He walks along the water with the half-pleased gait of a man who hears a tune most people do not like, and turns the corner under the bridge, and there is no body to follow because the corner is not the corner you think it is. The swans soften and crease themselves back into sleep. The wind goes looking for a field it mislaid.\n\nI do not move for a while, because to move would be to admit I am standing, and to admit I am standing would be to admit I have a shadow. The river does not look at me. The night keeps its courtesies. When I finally go, I walk the long way round, up by the university where the glass buildings are still trying on versions of themselves. Students spill sugar all over the steps and sleep in lecture halls. I pass a bench where someone has carved a heart around two names: D + M. The groove is clean, as if the wood has just been wounded. I lay my hand on it. The heart beats once under my hand. Twice. Then stops. I leave my coin in the notch, a payment to no one at all. Or to the math.\n\nThere\u2019s a girl called Evie who works nights at a coffee shop near the Stonebow and pretends to study accounting in daylight. She has an expression that tells you she wanted to be nearly anything else. I like her because she can\u2019t help but be kind even when there\u2019s no cost to unkind. She always gives me the last cinnamon bun for free and tells me to stop looking like someone\u2019s about to ask me for a miracle. Her hair is not a color Nature used on purpose but looks good anyway. Tonight, the shop is closing when I reach it. She resets the chalkboard in the window upside down without noticing.\n\n\u201cOi,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look like you saw a man try to talk a swan into a mortgage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was worse,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was polite.\u201d\n\nShe looks past me at the street, which is empty but is never empty enough for Evie\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou want a sandwich? We\u2019ve got the ones with the ham and the ones without ham that look like they have ham. Also one with egg that someone gave a right telling off to. It\u2019s sad as anything. Don\u2019t take him; he\u2019ll ruin your night.\u201d\n\nI take the ham. I pay in small change that looks like it wants to be something else. She passes me a napkin folded into a paper boat. I know better than to ask questions. Evie\u2019s paper boats float where other boats would sink and carry what other boats refuse.\n\n\u201cYou hungry or just delaying?\u201d she asks, and the way she asks tells me she doesn\u2019t need an answer; she enjoys the shape of the question itself.\n\n\u201cI ran into someone,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cI hope you ran out of him as well,\u201d she says. \u201cMen look at you like you\u2019re a bet they lost and want to win back. Don\u2019t let them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019s going to roll the world on its side and see what comes loose,\u201d I say, not meaning to say it, not meaning to put the shape of it into the air in a place with cinnamon and milk foam. It sounds ridiculous here, like claiming a fox will sue you for slander.\n\nEvie doesn\u2019t laugh. She looks at the street again and then at me. \u201cWhat would come loose?\u201d she asks. \u201cTeacups. Church bells. The idea of Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d I say.\n\nShe nods slowly as if I\u2019ve confirmed something she already half knew. \u201cYou going to stop him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, as if I can. The word, once out of my mouth, finds a place to sit down. It looks at me. It waits.\n\n\u201cYou look cold,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI am always cold,\u201d I say, not meaning to say that either. I tuck my hands in the pockets of my coat. The marble is there, warm as a small thing that believes in being held. There\u2019s a moment \u2013 silly, brief \u2013 when I imagine folding myself a paper boat and climbing in and going down the Witham to where the city stops dreaming and the fields are simple and honest and flat as a palm. But I am not the kind of man who gets to leave.\n\n\u201cCome back in when you need your hands to stop shaking,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t stay where a door can\u2019t see you. Promise me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d I say, and she knows the shape of my mouth when I do not mean a promise and forgive me anyway.\n\nI sleep poorly, too much river in me from the night, and dream not at all. In the morning the city pretends again. Children with red noses and ill-fitting uniforms pull their mothers to the school gate. Men in vans do that ballet at intersections where everyone is only slightly murderous. A woman in a yellow coat counts pigeons and is pleased when she arrives at a number that means Wednesday. I go to the market and buy carrots from a man who thinks he is angry with God but is only hungry. I watch a dog refuse to cross a line painted on the pavement that no longer exists. I do not go to the Cathedral. I go to the library instead.\n\nLincoln\u2019s library is the kind of building a young worlock can get lost in. If you stand in the local history aisle long enough the spines will begin to breathe. I pull down a book that smells of coal dust and photographs and find in it a penciled note that was meant for someone else. \u201cI hid the thing. There is no move that leaves us blameless.\u201d It is dated with a year the city does not admit to. I take the note and put it in my mouth and let it dissolve. Paper is good at remembering. If you don\u2019t break the chain, sometimes what is written keeps happening. I spit the taste into my handkerchief and fold it into my sleeve.\n\nA woman approaches while I\u2019m frowning at maps. She is the sort of person my life has taught me to dread: tidy, observant, wearing a coat that takes itself seriously, carrying a notebook with straight lines and tight handwriting. She has grief on her wrist like a watch. She says, \u201cMr. March?\u201d and it isn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cDepends who\u2019s asking,\u201d I say, even though she\u2019s already told me.\n\n\u201cInspector Lorna Hallam,\u201d she says, showing me the wallet, the badge, the clean authority that comes from being at once underestimated and in possession of very sharp teeth. \u201cI\u2019d like a word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a man with words,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cThey rent the place by the week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had incidents,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had birds falling out of the air and clocks talking to men who don\u2019t wear watches and a child who insists her mother lost Monday in the washing machine. We\u2019ve had five\u2014\u201d She stops herself, as if numbers are dangerous here. \u201cWe\u2019ve had several people insisting that the Cathedral changed size while they were in it. Did it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is good at that,\u201d I say. \u201cBut you know that already. You wouldn\u2019t be here if you were a woman who only knew clocks and step-counters.\u201d\n\nShe does not rise to the bait. \u201cPeople tell me your name when they think I will laugh at them and be kind afterward. They tell me your name when they are afraid to say anything else. I don\u2019t like giving fear the run of my city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen keep it on a short leash,\u201d I say. \u201cOr let me.\u201d\n\nShe eyes me. \u201cHelp me and I won\u2019t try to arrest you for fraud and make a spectacle of you. Don\u2019t help me and I might. I won\u2019t enjoy it. But there are men above me who like to pretend spectacle is a kind of proof.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you arrest gravity for pushing?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI would if it started choosing,\u201d she says, and something in that makes me like her more than I mean to. \u201cWho\u2019s doing this to us. Is it you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s a man in a black coat who wants to tilt the world and see what breaks. He\u2019s picking at seams. Lincoln is seamful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your place in all this?\u201d Her pen is poised. It is not the kind you can buy in a shop.\n\n\u201cI stand where the seam is and try not to pull too hard.\u201d I slide her the paper boat Evie folded, because I do not know why and because sometimes you do a thing without the run-up of reason. \u201cTake this. Don\u2019t open it unless you\u2019re somewhere that remembers your childhood hands. If it gets heavy, don\u2019t drop it. Put it in water and it will do the right thing.\u201d\n\nShe does not laugh. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the right thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will float,\u201d I say, which is both everything and nothing.\n\nShe gives me a look that says she will not be comforted by old men waving smoke at doorways. \u201cIf you\u2019re lying to me I will find out and I will make it inconvenient,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re telling the truth I will still make it inconvenient. But I\u2019ll thank you later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not thank me,\u201d I say softly. \u201cNo one ever does. We do our bit of string and someone else cuts it and calls the knot a friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe ready,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I call.\u201d\n\nShe leaves. I read maps until the lines stop meaning rivers and certainty. When I come out of the library the sun has decided on a time of day and the city fits the idea like a borrowed coat. There are men with vans and women with kindness and a boy with a stolen apple in his pocket. I watch him decide not to eat it and leave it under a bench. A crow discovers it. Its beak is a small, deft blade. It is a pretty little monster in a town that makes room for all kinds.\n\nI turn up to the Cathedral because I am a man built of defiance and habit. I go round the side, breathe on the key that is not a key, and press the stone worn by fingers the city didn\u2019t keep. The door opens an inch. It does not want me. The air that comes out is Sunday, old blanket. And something else. The same three beats I heard yesterday, but with a hollow, tired lag between the second and third. A wrong heartbeat. I push. The door does not open further. For a moment I see my hand on the wood the way you see a hand on glass from the other side, a ghost trapped in a photograph waving at you from 1892. I leave my hand where it is. The wood is warm. There is a sensation of it thinking about letting me go through.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d says a voice behind me. A verger, small and round, mustaches like dogs\u2019 tails. He is polite. Terribly. \u201cWe\u2019ve a service.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d I say, stepping back. My hand does not come with me. It stays on the door. There is a pause. Then it comes, reluctantly, like a misbehaving child. The verger does not see it. Or he sees it and puts it somewhere for later. He smiles. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he says. It sounds like a hope and a warning.\n\nI spend the late afternoon in the Roman part of the city where the gate pretends it still has soldiers. There is a chip in one stone where someone once sharpened a knife in a hurry. There is a scorch mark where a house learned it was made of tinder. I touch the stone and think about the thing Nan said \u2013 that Rook was bound to the Moor Gate and then unbound when the Keeper went to the sea willing. I think about loose ends. I think about knots and marbles and the geometry of falling. If you drop something and it doesn\u2019t land, have you still dropped it. If a man is unweighted without dying, does he end up somewhere or nowhere. The wind gets in my collar. The sky is a dull coin.\n\nThat night I do not go to the water. I go east instead, out to the edges where the city remembers it has fields, and I walk along the hedges until I find the place where the path runs quieter than it should. There is a stone there with a scorch of lichen that looks like a map of an island everyone lost in a fire. The hedge is blackthorn and obstinate. The ditch smells of iron. I kneel. I put my palm on the soil. The earth thinks about me. It does not think too hard. It is not my business, what the earth decides. I am the wrong sort of thing for that. I can persuade. I cannot require.\n\n\u201cShow me the line,\u201d I say.\n\nThe grass leans. A blade points. A beetle climbs and changes its mind. You learn to take your portents as they come. I follow the line to a hollow where once \u2013 by the look of it \u2013 there was water. The day is too dry. The hollow remembers rain. At its center is a circle of grey stone that the tractors never quite levelled. I stand in it, and the world is \u2013 to my surprise \u2013 briefly true. The wind pulls my coat. My heart is there, and there again, and there again. Same wrong gait as the Cathedral. Three beats, with the long tired lag between the second and third.\n\n\u201cRook,\u201d I say softly, and the hollow answers with nothing. The hollow is honest. It gives me only as much as it has.\n\nWhen I get home the house has had visitors. You can tell by the dust. The dust behaves differently when a stranger crosses it. It chooses new places to settle, to better catch a footprint, to better hide one. The air is too tidy. I put my key on the table and it rolls where it shouldn\u2019t and lands where it didn\u2019t. I go from room to room. I feel nothing but the feeling of someone else deciding not to touch my things. It is an odd relief, and a worse fear.\n\nOn my kitchen table there is a note written in an ink that resists being seen. You only see it if you look between words, the way you look for a name you\u2019ve forgotten in a list of names that are not yours. \u201cThe boy by the bridge,\u201d the note says. \u201cHe won\u2019t come home.\u201d It is kind enough to give me the time and the place like a little prayer. Rook is not the only man who enjoys a courtesy.\n\nI go because I am made of going. The bridge is the one the university built to make two sides of a promise be true at once. A boy stands on it, fourteen, perhaps, with hair he cut himself and the kind of shoulders that make me think of men who hate their own fathers. He looks at me as if he recognizes me and does not like that fact. He has a stone in his hand. He is considering where to put the stone when it stops being a stone.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I say, and this is the most honest thing I\u2019ve said today.\n\n\u201cThey say you do magic,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say you make lines on the ground and lie to people about what they\u2019re standing on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say a lot,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI say there\u2019s a man who told me I could put the stone in the right place and it would make everything fair.\u201d His mouth moves around fair like a cat around a bowl of milk it does not own. \u201cI say I\u2019d like to try.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met him,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was wearing a coat that was trying to swallow him. He doesn\u2019t like us to use his first name.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said to call him Mr. Rook,\u201d the boy says, which confirms more than anything else. \u201cHe said I could give the river a mouth full of teeth. He said I could shut it and open it and shut it again. And then my mum would stop making me be two different boys for two different houses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not what will happen,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you put the stone where he told you to put it the river will forget where the bridge is. It will remember another line. It will leave the swans standing in a car park. Your mother will still have two houses. You will still be two boys. You\u2019ll just be wetter.\u201d\n\nHe hesitates. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I say, without tremor, because there is a hollow east of town that taught me the shape of a lie. \u201cYou know how I know? I had a mother like yours. I walked between houses like yours. I learned to keep my two selves in good pockets. The river won\u2019t fix that. It will just get between them and be yet another thing you have to cross.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me then like he would like to hit me, and then like he would like to apologize for wanting to, and then like he would like me to hug him, and he hates that worst of all. He throws the stone. It lands in the water. The water makes the sound of swallowing a coin. A little hiss. The bridge hums for a second and then stops, deciding against it. The boy sits down hard on the metal and cries like a cough. I sit down beside him. I do not touch him. I do not tell him it will be all right. We do not live in the kind of city where that is ever a promise we can make without apology. I say, \u201cDo you want to be the boy who put the stone in the wrong place and drowned an old man walking home from his pub. Or do you want to be the boy who told a man in a black coat to go to hell.\u201d\n\nHe sniffs. \u201cCan I be a boy who goes home and does his homework and then doesn\u2019t have to think about it ever again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be the boy who goes home and does his homework and thinks about it some of the time,\u201d I say.\n\nHe gets up. He wipes his face with his sleeve like the child he still is. \u201cIf I see him again,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll spit.\u201d He doesn\u2019t mean it. He will do what he can. He will also sleep. We are all doing what we can.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I say. \u201cIf he ducks, spit again.\u201d\n\nHe laughs, unexpectedly, and then eyes me as if he\u2019s not supposed to. \u201cYou cold?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou look it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been standing outside a house for a long time waiting to be let in.\u201d\n\nHe goes before I can answer. I walk home slow, thinking of thresholds. The door opens as if I\u2019ve knocked, which I haven\u2019t. I step in and the house lets me in the way a cat lets you stroke it when it thinks you are an unusual patch of sunlight. I put the marble on the windowsill and it watches the street. I put the note I retrieved from my sleeve under a glass. I sleep.\n\nToward morning, a clock that isn\u2019t mine rings an hour that never was. In the minute before waking, my right hand is trapped in wood again, a door that thinks I am an idea. I am very light. I am very tired. A child is standing by the bed. The child is me, which is a trick of the light. He is holding a dead bird. He says, \u201cYou have to go in, Silas.\u201d The dead bird opens its beak and drops a bell the size of a nail, and it falls and it falls and it doesn\u2019t land.\n\nI wake with the taste of iron. There is salt on my mouth. Morning has made up its mind. Nan\u2019s cat is sitting on my windowsill, which is a feat, considering the distance. It blinks. It says, without speaking \u2013 things are very clear when they matter \u2013 \u201cThe north door is open where it should not be.\u201d\n\nI get up and put on my coat. The city is waiting for me to tell it something it already knows. The Cathedral is a tall story. The lines are playing scales. The river is not hungry, which is worse than when it is. I step into the street and I am aware of my weight, which is not the weight most men have. It is a borrowed thing. It is a habit of the city and of me. And it is, for the first time in a very long time, thinking about coming due.Morning doesn\u2019t so much begin as admit it has been waiting under the tablecloth all night, counting crumbs. The cat blinks again, a slow curtain drawing and undrawing, and hops from the sill at a point in space that isn\u2019t there. I put my hand to the place where the air wills itself to be window and find the glass colder than the hour should allow. Streets below have their collars up. A milk lorry murmurs a psalm to itself that would prefer not to be overheard. When I lock my door I listen to the sound the key makes, a cheap little throat-clearing, and tell it to be brave. The house swallows. I tell myself the same.\n\nBy the time I reach the top of the hill the light has changed sides twice, testing which shoulder it fancies. Nan Pearce is on her step with a tin of ash and an expression the postman learned not to argue with in 1987. She has tea on the sill steaming into the cold as if to make fog her own. \u201cI did my nine,\u201d she says without looking up. \u201cOne for each soot-sprite and one for luck. Don\u2019t you say I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d I say, and I don\u2019t. She watches my hands without appearing to. I notice a smudge of graphite on her thumb, as if she\u2019s been drawing maps on the back of the day and doesn\u2019t yet want to show anyone.\n\n\u201cYou going up.\u201d It isn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cNorth door,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll have a mouth on it,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t put your hand where you can\u2019t see the teeth. And if it asks your name, give it the wrong one first, just to see how fussy it\u2019s being today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose name do you suggest.\u201d\n\nShe tips ash over the step, a grey tide in which three small black flecks hold their ground. \u201cBorrow mine,\u201d she says, and something in the way she offers it makes the bark at the base of my ribs soften. \u201cI can afford the bite.\u201d\n\nI carry her name in my cheek like a sweet and go on. The Cathedral sits like a thing that grew by minding its own business until everyone else got the hint. Up close, its stones are less grand than tired, fox-pawed by weather, greened in their hidden corners, bandaged in places by men with scaffolding and the confidence of people who believe gravity is a hobby. The north door is, as promised, ajar. Not open. Ajar in the way a mouth is when a dream forgets to close it. Cold breath. Honey light. A thin line of shadow like a string ready to be cut.\n\nI do not knock. I am not the sort of man who knocks on a door that knows my weight. I put my palm flat against the wood, which is both dry and damp, both Thursday and somebody\u2019s wedding day. It hums against my skin in three uneven pulses. I say, softly, \u201cNan Pearce,\u201d and the hum falters as if something indoors has forgotten its place in a procession. I say, just as softly, \u201cSilas March,\u201d and the hum steadies into itself, unimpressed by ceremony. The door allows me sideways, the way a polite host allows a stranger past a hallway painting without admitting it\u2019s hanging wrong.\n\nThe air inside has that cathedral trick of being both taller than it is and shallower than you\u2019d expect. Sounds fall upward and down the same channel, arriving back as if they took a shortcut through a bell and forgot their coats. Dust hangs in the sun like shy punctuation. I keep to the shadow at the left, where the stone remembers hands. Two steps and the floor finds the idea that is not quite level. Three steps and my right sleeve is heavier than my left. It takes a breath to realise the marble in my pocket has woken to itself the way a fish remembers water after the net. I take it out carefully. It is warm and looking. The fleck of gold winks like a star pretending not to have been seen.\n\n\u201cMind your manners,\u201d I tell it, as if that will do, and it clicks once against my nail, a little clock shrugging. When I hold it out, the air pulls toward it with the reluctance of a child sent to fetch coal. The blue deepens. The nave breathes in. I have the sudden, inconvenient memory of the ladder in the dry well and the particular fear of the place where the fall never completes itself. I close my fist. The marble still makes the blue behind my knuckles.\n\nI half expect a man in a black coat to lean against a pillar and begin a speech about angles, but the only person is a verger in the middle distance pretending not to see a shadow that belongs to me askew on the flagstones. Beyond him, a tourist with a tide-mark on her scarf looks up as if someone gently tugged a hair at the nape of her neck, then decides that nothing about her day requires explanation and consults her map. The building is doing that thing buildings do when they are shy of admitting they have a fever. I can feel the long lines running under the city shift their weight. The north one is the worst of it, a note on a faulty organ pipe.\n\nUnder the misericords there is a draught where no window owns up to being the culprit. My usual spot has borrowed a slant from a staircase I haven\u2019t yet found. I kneel, which is a courtesy as much as a convenience, and the wood under my knees answers with a little ache that doesn\u2019t belong to me. Splinter, lead, feather; they all have tongues if you\u2019ll listen to them longer than is comfortable. I put the marble in the shadow of the bench, because shadows can be counted on to mind precious things when light gets distracted. I empty my pockets in the way of a man who knows what his pockets are for: a length of green thread, a cheap brass key with no door, a folded prayer that isn\u2019t in any book, a coin that wants to pay for a sin and can\u2019t find the till. Put the coin in the notch of the wood. Lay the thread in a circle where a circle would be if people hadn\u2019t made everything crooked. Hold the key in my teeth and speak a name I wasn\u2019t given but earned. It is small work dressed up as faith and I do not pretend otherwise.\n\nThe first thing that answers is a boot. Not a whole man, no voices, just the memory of a boot crossing the floor in a hurry when war rattled glass. The second is a laugh that wants to be a cough. The third is a sound like a bell trying to ring backward, which is the one that makes my mouth go dry. The backward bell wraps round the marble under the misericord and I see, as clear as any memory I didn\u2019t live, a hand I do not know dropping a blue thing into mortar where no child has reason to reach. Once you see one blue bead, your eye makes a habit of it. There are ten. No, fewer; five. Not marbles; hearts stilled and made small. Not hearts; anchors. Not anchors; the opposite. Rook has been busy, or has inherited someone\u2019s old busyness and found a new way to spend it.\n\n\u201cTouch those and see if you can still count your fingers,\u201d says a voice behind and above me, tart as apple skin. I don\u2019t jump. We do not jump in places that taught us a new application for silence. I glance up to find Inspector Hallam doing a tidy job of pretending she\u2019s a woman who has never been told she looks out of place in a church. Her hair bears witness to rain. Her coat is the sort that knows what to do in a draught. The notebook is in her hand without having been taken out of a pocket.\n\n\u201cYou open your present,\u201d I ask, meaning the boat, and she looks briefly as if I\u2019ve asked a question the room itself will report to her superior.\n\n\u201cI put it in the sink,\u201d she says. \u201cIt pinwheeled once, which made my cat disapprove, and then sat there being unhelpful. It is currently catching the light and making me remember a toy I had when I was eight and hated because it worked. You can tell me later why it made my kitchen forget its angle. Are you going to explain why the floor here has an opinion about where my feet go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re teaching the building a new step,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019ve put weights where weights don\u2019t belong and taken them away where they do. You can make a song go slant with less.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s they,\u201d she says, but it\u2019s not a question so much as a habit.\n\n\u201cWren\u2019s wrong boy,\u201d I say, which does nothing to make this a conversation we could have in a report. \u201cAnd anyone who measured for him and anyone who had a hand in an old thing they\u2019d rather not be responsible for now that the plot\u2019s decided to go on without them.\u201d\n\nShe gives the place where my pockets emptied their truths a narrow-eyed frown and adjusts her stance by a half inch as if she has been listening to the floor longer than polite society encourages. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three separate people tell us they walked through a door here and arrived in a room with no walls. One of them claims she saw her wedding day pressed into air like a flower under glass. They all swear they didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t meaning that counts,\u201d I say. \u201cMeaning's a decoration. It\u2019s the little physics of where your feet go. Rook will make doors where there shouldn\u2019t be and then insist he didn\u2019t draw them. He likes it when we call it fate.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse plain words,\u201d she says, and there is a plea in it, unadorned. \u201cPretend I\u2019m your little sister. Pretend I still believe it\u2019s my job to get things into the right box and then close the lid firmly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to dislocate the city by resetting the Cathedral\u2019s idea of down,\u201d I say, which is not as plain as I meant. \u201cWorse, he\u2019s going to do it with things you\u2019d let a child put in his mouth. Marbles and coins and the notion of ladders that go only one way.\u201d\n\nInspector Hallam takes this with the composure of a woman who once heard a man tell her he\u2019d misplaced his brother and found him in the wardrobe and sorted both of them without a raised voice. \u201cCan you stop him.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a minute,\u201d I say. \u201cIf I can find the knot he tied and put a different knot on top with a story the building prefers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe planet will step sideways and forget to bring us,\u201d I say, and I am tired of hearing my own melodrama. \u201cHelp me. Stand there. Not on the gold star; it isn\u2019t a star. Three inches to your left. No, left. No, the other honest left.\u201d\n\nShe moves without complaining. The hem of her coat touches the shadow of a pew and the shadow warms. She feels it and doesn\u2019t start. I place the brass key under the bench where the marble lies and lay the thread across the stone so that people with hearts of poetry would call it a line and people with engineering degrees would call it interference and both would be right. The coin under the notch shifts all on its own, fed up of being good, and I press my thumb on its face until the cold and the metal and the long idea of payment have a little argument. When I lift my thumb, the coin stays where a sensible thing would fall and the backward bell in the air breathes out a fraction.\n\nNan Pearce taught me this much when I was the kind of boy who came to her door because he\u2019d made a circle with salt and couldn\u2019t get out of it without stepping on his own lie. To make a building forgive itself, you put something small where the wrong large thing is and ask the small thing to be brave. Buildings are large-hearted; they will protect what is tender if you give them half a reason. I do this five times where the blue glints in the mortar. The fifth is the kind that bites, a slick little tug in the teeth, and Inspector Hallam steadies the bench with her palm without breaking the line of her spine.\n\n\u201cIs that it,\u201d she asks, and I envy her neatness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grace,\u201d I say. \u201cIt will hold the hour. After that, someone stubborn will come and pick them out like a grandmother with a seam-ripper who disapproves of a new dress.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that someone is Mr. Rook,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cOr a boy he tells is performing a civic duty at midnight,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s fond of giving men tasks that make them feel useful, and then telling them the job required knives only after they\u2019ve cut themselves.\u201d\n\nShe watches me for a moment without writing down a word. \u201cThe bells haven\u2019t rung on the hour for two days,\u201d she says. \u201cWe told the papers there\u2019s maintenance. Is there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d I say. \u201cThe building is telling the city something about breath. We\u2019re used to count in tens. She wants to count in threes and lags.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the three is broken,\u201d I say, and the cynic in me is too tired to sneer at the man who talks like a book. \u201cBecause the long line under the north gate has been unbound from its keeper. Because there is a stone in the east fields that will not lie still. Because a woman with a pocket full of pebbles woke up in salt and the rope she was holding had no hook.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t ask me how I know. I think she has learned the way of it already: that some answers aren\u2019t ours but belong to places, and the places intend to keep them. \u201cIf I need you,\u201d she says, \u201cand I will, what do I do to make the telephone call you back when you ignore it.\u201d\n\n\u201cStand where you can see two doors at once and say my name twice,\u201d I say, and then, because I can feel the Cathedral\u2019s ear turn, I add, \u201cSay Nan Pearce\u2019s name first.\u201d\n\nShe almost smiles. \u201cShe told me once,\u201d she says, \u201cthat the city keeps a pocket watch in its shoe and only looks at it when a bus is late. Do you know what that means.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means there are clocks and then there are clocks,\u201d I say.\n\nWe leave on the south side because the north door thinks too hard about trapping my hand and that is a conversation for an hour when I can afford to be an idea again. Outside, the day has committed to cloud. People do the small, brave labour of pretending they are not hearing a slow steadiness where they expect chimes. Inspector Hallam walks away as if she is going to make a phone call and instead will stand in a stairwell and fold up a boat she didn\u2019t mean to be careful with. I turn toward the cloisters and the little walled garden that professionals of God have taught to sit without shaking.\n\nA girl is there who doesn\u2019t know I saw her by the water last night. She is different under day, her hair less a herald, her coat more a decision, but the clove rides the air like a porch light. She doesn\u2019t look up when I sit on the stone bench opposite, which is good manners. Her fingers worry a pocket that might have salt in it. At her feet, bees consider the last of the year\u2019s ivies and decide they owe nobody anything. I watch her for the length of nine heartbeats and she does not twitch. Good instincts. Bad advice. I wait until she looks and then I give her a nod that says the trick with the copper coin is only as clever as the day allows and that there are nights when you put back the pence and go to bed without tea.\n\n\u201cYou said sheep,\u201d she says in the voice people use when they are tall enough not to be told anything anymore.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cDreams are poor drivers. They miss their turns. Did you sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched my walls,\u201d she says, as if that is an apology. \u201cAnd then I got up before my mother would write me a text that makes a noise but means nothing. Are there more of them. The marbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are more of everything than anyone has a right to keep,\u201d I say. \u201cStay away from bridges for a while. Rook is fond of them at the minute. They\u2019re the right shape for the trick he\u2019s playing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d she says, and I appreciate the fairness of it. \u201cStaying away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the wrong kind of shape for staying away. Go to Nan Pearce if the tea tastes of pennies. She\u2019ll pretend to scold you and give you a biscuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me a rule,\u201d she says, \u201cthat isn\u2019t a superstition pretending it has a degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone offers you a way to make two halves even, ask who draws the line,\u201d I say. \u201cIf he says \u2018the world does,\u2019 spit in his eye.\u201d\n\nShe almost, almost smiles, the way a window almost fogs under a good breath in winter. \u201cI liked the way the river looked when it was wrong,\u201d she says, and the honesty of it knocks a soft place loose in me I didn\u2019t mean to show anyone. \u201cLike you could see the bottom for once. It made a noise like attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t looking at you,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was staring at a hole in itself. That\u2019s when people fall in with their eyes open.\u201d\n\nShe nods as if I have told her something she will put in her pocket and take out to polish when she is lonely. When I leave, I can feel her looking at my back in a way that is not possession and not plea but the lighter cousin of both.\n\nThe plan, such as I have ever been the sort of man who makes one, is to go to the east fields and sit on the stone that does not lie still until it chooses to speak in a voice older than my mistrust. The city has other ideas. Down Steep Hill I am taken in tow by a procession of schoolchildren in visible earmuffs and invisible armies of questions. They are shepherded by a teacher who has the energy of two cups of tea and the patience of someone who has learned to ignore her watch when a small boy finds a beetle. As they pass the old Roman gate two of them count in languages I cannot name and the third stumbles at nine as if nine is a step missing on a staircase. I catch his shoulder because the day is made of courtesies and he doesn\u2019t notice my hand; he notices the air where it isn\u2019t hot.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d says a voice that is a stone thrown without violence, and because I have been expecting a stone all morning my arm is already up to catch it. Evie stands with her apron twisted in both fists, looking like a person who has done a kind thing and would now like to call a friend and ask to be told she did a kind thing. \u201cThere\u2019s a man came into the shop with a bell in his pocket,\u201d she says without preamble. \u201cNot a bell you could ring. The kind that bites noises. He put it on the counter and asked if I would call a number that doesn\u2019t ring. I didn\u2019t call it. I put the bell under the till and the milk soured in my cup. I want you to tell me whether to throw it in the bin or call your inspector and say there\u2019s a crime but I can\u2019t spell it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake me,\u201d I say, and she turns without looking to see if I\u2019ve followed, her feet sure even when the pavement forgets its responsibilities and trips three old men at once. The shop smells of cinnamon and a little burnt coffee and the inside of an afternoon. On the chalkboard someone has written a heart with the word \u201clunch\u201d in it and underlined both as if a romance can be scheduled into existence. The bell under the till is a hard little thing the colour of a bruise older than a week. When I put my finger near it, the air withdraws, offended. When I say \u201cSilas March\u201d under my breath, the bell sniffs and pretends not to hear. When I say \u201cNan Pearce\u201d it clicks. I do not attempt to be offended on my own behalf.\n\n\u201cWhose is it,\u201d Evie asks, with the courage that is doing business as cheek.\n\n\u201cMr. Rook\u2019s,\u201d I say. \u201cOr someone who thought they could borrow Mr. Rook\u2019s and return it before he counted.\u201d I pick it up by the lip and it is colder than the milk. The counter darkens where it leaves, not with stain but with the sort of shadow that happens when an idea sits down. \u201cThis is for stopping the ring,\u201d I say. \u201cHe seeded the Cathedral with anchors; he seeded the city with mutes. When you take the lid off the pot, the steam goes somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it do to people,\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cMakes the wrong noises louder,\u201d I say. \u201cMakes the right ones come up for air at the wrong time. Makes children say it\u2019s Monday when it\u2019s only ever been Thursday here.\u201d\n\nShe watches my hands as if they are a solution to a problem that has had the rudeness not to present itself neatly. \u201cDo I throw it away,\u201d she asks, and her voice is brittle in the places of it that care about receipt books and tills that balance and a life that could be all right if left alone.\n\n\u201cIf you throw it away it will make the dust fall wrong and a man with a van will forget how to reverse,\u201d I say. \u201cIf I take it it will make my pocket heavier. If we keep it here under metal it will sulk and do its worst trick slowly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the worst trick,\u201d she says, with admirable professionalism.\n\n\u201cIt stops a bell you cannot hear,\u201d I say. \u201cThe one that tells you when to run and when to stay. The one you used last night when you stood up and decided not to count the swans. Keep it very still. Put sugar on it and tell your till a joke. If it laughs you\u2019ve won an hour.\u201d\n\nEvie sighs in that full-bodied way people do when they decide to be kind to themselves despite the day\u2019s mood. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re handsome,\u201d she says, without malice. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t, all of this would sound like a very long excuse. Go. Before I ask you to untie the knot in the corner there and you tell me it\u2019s a helpful ghost.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll look at the knot on my way out or not,\u201d I say, and her grin is a thing I don\u2019t deserve and will live on longer than it should.\n\nOn the square, a wind has fetched up from the east with the particular dirt of that direction in it. It smells of hedges and the tin pan clatter of rain that hasn\u2019t committed yet. I take the east road and feel the city peel away in strips like bark, the new houses sore around the edges where the old plan resents them. Fields gather out of habit. At the ditch the blackthorn puts its spines up, which is what blackthorn does best. The hollow where the stone lies looks innocent as a nap. I sit with my feet in grass that cannot decide whose side it\u2019s on and listen to the ground fail to hide the beat moving under it.\n\n\u201cShow me where you came loose,\u201d I say, and am about to feel a fool when a rook \u2013 an actual bird, the sort that will teach you economy of wing if you let it \u2013 drops something from its beak at the edge of the circle. Not a twig. A small loop of wire, the kind used to tie up roses and sometimes used to tie up worse. I pick it up and it is warm although nothing that ought to heat it has touched it. There is a hair caught in it. Thin. Grey. Long enough to have belonged to a woman who had learned to plait with patience. The stone under my hand thinks about my palm. The earth opens its mouth a fraction and breathes a syllable like a door with bad manners.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here alone,\u201d Nan says, except she isn\u2019t present and doesn\u2019t need to be to say it. Her voice comes down the hedge like a warning tied with ribbon. \u201cIf he\u2019s been stepping on my floorboards without telling me, he\u2019s been stepping on yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe leaves courtesies where they cost him more than they cost me,\u201d I say, aloud or into the ground; it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cHe left me a boy at a bridge. He left Evie a bell. He left the Cathedral anchors and mutes. This wire is for planting in the wrong place and calling it gardening.\u201d\n\nThe wind turns cold in the middle, which is a talent I wish it had less often. On it I hear the three-beat ring lagging like a drunk who wants you to think he\u2019s sober. I put the loop flat on the stone and say the name I do not say to most men, the one that fits in my throat like a piece of cherry pit. The loop twitches, a little worm remembering earth. I drop salt around it in a circle so small it feels mean. The wire is the size of a god if you\u2019re an ant. My hands aren\u2019t shaking. That arrives later, when there\u2019s nothing left to do and the only thing to be is cold.\n\nRook is with me without being with me. The air takes on that pricked-at-back-of-neck care you only get when you realise the sky is listening. I could turn and find him leaning on a stile making a case for difficult kindness and the civilising properties of calamity. Instead I look at the blackthorn and the blackthorn looks back like an old woman with something to say about your shoes. I spit, once, the old way, the way that makes the salt take notice, and push the wire into the stone where stone pretends not to have seams. The moment it goes the earth lurches, not much, only enough to make my teeth want to say unpleasant words. The three-beat stumbles and then, for a breath, runs true. The hollow remembers water and changes its mind. Somewhere back toward the river a swan adjusts its feathers with an opinion.\n\nThe price is never what you think. I stand up and the weight I carry doesn\u2019t come with me. I can feel it behind, sitting down and refusing to budge like a cat you paid good money for and who has never once done anything on command. For a mean little second I am light in a way that needs a ladder down a well and a very long rope. I say my name, the long one, with all the syllables it has no business being allowed, and I can tell the sound has to go a longer way to find me than it should. When the weight arrives it drops into me with a thump that makes me say a word that would disappoint a vicar and a child who collects special adjectives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I tell the hedges, because that is the sort of lie that soothed a frightened mother and might yet soothe something else. The hedges are unimpressed. They know I will pay for the wire with a day shorter than it should be and hands colder than meat left on a doorstep in January. I would like a bun. I would like a table in a kitchen that understands me. I have neither. I have the long walk back into a city that will, if I ask properly, pretend it cannot smell what I\u2019ve been getting on my shoes.\n\nOn the way I meet a boy flying a kite without wind. He runs until his breath bursts and the kite lifts out of politeness. When it is high enough it remembers whose business it is and tugs a path invisible as a good lie. At the top of his run he looks at me in the way boys do who are measuring whether a man would resent being called uncle, and I nod. You must be generous with permissions. It gives the day an inch.\n\nThe Cathedral is quieter when I pass it again. Not quiet, which is an insult. Quieter, which is a truce. The bells still will not ring for the hour. They will ring for something else if asked properly by a hand that has earned the rope. The north door is shut, decent, the sort of closed that makes you feel a fool for trying the handle. I do not. I go to Nan instead and find her in the kitchen warming her hands at a stove that only admits to being fire when you tell it it is a chair. The cat watches me the way cats count to two.\n\n\u201cYou put it back,\u201d she says. She pours tea that will never be hot enough. \u201cFor an hour you\u2019ve bought us the price of seeing what comes next. Don\u2019t thank yourself. That kind of thank you trips the next man and he isn\u2019t ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvie\u2019s got a bell in a till,\u201d I say. \u201cIt is sulking under sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can keep it until half past,\u201d Nan says. \u201cThen she wraps it in wax paper and takes it to the river and tells it to teach fish to listen to snow. It won\u2019t, but the refusal will take it all night.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook will be angry,\u201d I say, a minor truth spoken to fill a space.\n\n\u201cRook is always angry,\u201d she says. \u201cThe man was built of wards that all failed, so he made his own and pretended they were other people\u2019s. He\u2019s been knocking on doors that do not belong to him since his feet had the grace of new boots. He has his uses. He reminds the city it is loved enough to be fought for.\u201d She looks at my hands and makes a sound like disapproval wrapped round pity. \u201cYou\u2019ll not go cold and call it a mood. You\u2019ll eat something while I read something I did not want to keep and kept. The Wren\u2019s boy left me a page once. He thought me stupid enough to burn it. I put it between two good cookbooks and told it I\u2019d use it when I ran out of biscuits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it,\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cThe order of who gets to carry the rope and for how long before their wrists give out,\u201d she says, and carries a jar to the table with the solemnity some women keep for wreaths.\n\nWe do not read it. Not yet. The kettle decides to be kind for once and the tea is only half cruel. On the sill the cat arranges its face into a map of a district no one believes in. The city pats its pockets for its pocket watch and checks it only to be certain the bus won\u2019t come when anyone expects. In the floor, close under our feet, there is a beat that is not the hour. It misses once and then, with a small human stubbornness I will never get tired of admiring, finds itself. The day makes a sound like something heavy put down gently on purpose.\n\nWhen the telephone rings it rings in a part of the house where there never was a telephone. Nan gets up as if the chair might follow her and makes the cords behave with a look women learn in rooms where men say the word committee too often. She holds out the receiver as if it is a bird she has taught to sit without pecking. \u201cFor you,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the inspector. She sounds like a woman who opened a paper boat and found a river where a list should be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened,\u201d I ask when the wires remember my ear.\n\n\u201cThe clock in the Stonebow tried to strike thirteen,\u201d Inspector Hallam says, crisp as a new apron. \u201cIt got as far as eleven and then remembered it was a stone. Half the high street walked like men on a ship. I have one elderly gentleman who says he shook a hand under an arch and it shook back and kept his hand. Tell me where to stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the arch where the pigeon refuses to shit,\u201d I say, which is more instruction than most days grant. \u201cFace the cathedral. Put your left hand on the stone and your right on your own belt. Don\u2019t let go of the belt. Say the word noon as if you mean it and if anyone laughs at you tell them to bring you a chair and a sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d she says, only that, and the way she means it has the weight of a woman who has learned to delegate to men without letting them get ideas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t tell it your name until I get there. If it asks, tell it you\u2019re Nan Pearce and that you\u2019ll wait.\u201d\n\nWe hang up as if we were always meant to, in the middle of something, like a book dropped to answer a knock. Nan pours jam into a saucer and writes a letter in it with a knife. The letter is the shape letters make when they have been doing something else for a very long time and resent being summoned. I don\u2019t ask who it is to. I put on my coat because it is cold and because coats are the last promise you make before leaving a room where you were real. When I step into the street the city pretends to be ordinary for my sake and fails at it. The Cathedral watches without blinking. The long line under the north door hums like someone with the tune and none of the words. The world is thinking about the cost of tilt and finding small change under the sofa. I run, if the movement I manage can be called that, down a hill that remembers my feet and is not yet done adding them up.The Stonebow has the posture of an old soldier who knows where his scars are and won\u2019t be told otherwise. Between his legs the street does its little dance of vans and pushchairs and men whose legs remember mines. The clock sits in its housing like a single bright eye that would prefer to be shut. Under the arch Inspector Hallam stands exactly where I told her to, which is the first kindness of the day and a surprising one. Her left hand is on the stone; her right fists her own belt with that particular authority only women who\u2019ve learned to hold a room with a throat clear possess. A small crowd has the decency to pretend they are not a crowd. They become pedestrians with urgent destinations at the sight of a woman who might be about to write their names down.\n\n\u201cYou took your time,\u201d she says without the sting of reproach, and I am grateful to her for it. Her mouth is set where her patience keeps its teeth.\n\n\u201cTime takes me,\u201d I say, and she exhales in a way that says she will allow me one sentence like that per morning. \u201cSay noon again. Mean it as if you\u2019re telling a lie you want to become true.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoon,\u201d she says, and the arch passes the word up through its body like a fish passed hand to hand along a line of children who have discovered a stream where there didn\u2019t used to be one. The clock quivers. It wants very much to be thirteen and knows that is an impoliteness. It tries for twelve and cannot find the shore.\n\nThere is a man to the side with his hand pressed against nothing. His wrist is cocked awkward, fingers splayed as if showing us all he\u2019s harmless. He turns slow when I look at him and his eyes are that surprised blue some men keep like a spare shirt. \u201cIt kept me,\u201d he says in a voice that wants to apologize for the weather. \u201cI gave my hand to a gentleman whose face I can\u2019t see. He kept it. I am still wearing it.\u201d He waves the air where his skin pretends to be. The air makes the sound of old leather refusing.\n\n\u201cWho did you shake,\u201d I ask, not unkind, and his mouth folds around the answer as if it is rude.\n\n\u201cThe city,\u201d he says finally. \u201cShe had a man\u2019s hand on, just then. It seemed wrong to refuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever refuse a city who offers her hand,\u201d I say. \u201cBut make sure she gives it back when the hour has finished.\u201d I put my fingers to the stone where his shadow drags and my hand tingles in that particular way that says you\u2019re about to find out whether you\u2019re paying or being paid. The Stonebow is a gate with long memories of terms and conditions. He likes to keep a token, a cuff, a skin-echo, because that\u2019s what gates do when they\u2019re asked to behave like men.\n\n\u201cI brought a better thing to hold,\u201d I tell him, and take the glove from my pocket I carry for borrowings. It is no more than cheap suede and a superstition, but it has been used as a hand more often than some men\u2019s hands, and the Stonebow appreciates experience. I slide the glove into the air where the man\u2019s fingers can\u2019t exit and the arch takes it with the offended dignity of an aunt given the wrong gift at Christmas. The man\u2019s hand comes away, reluctant as a dog from a butcher\u2019s door, and he makes a sound people only make when a body part remembers what it is for. His eyes dampen without permission and he closes them, because that is how men of his age say thank you.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t shake anything for a week,\u201d I tell him, and he nods as if I\u2019ve sentenced him to kindness. \u201cIf a stranger offers you his hand, offer him your shoulder. If he insists, cough in his face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I can do,\u201d he says, and the smile on the corner of his mouth proves there is a reason I like this city even when it is trying to walk on its side.\n\nInspector Hallam hasn\u2019t moved. She is all attention to the stone and to the belt and to an invisible place halfway between both. Up above us, the clock limbers. A pigeon sits on the one patch of the arch nobody fouls and regards me with the disapproval reserved for men who\u2019ve put their coats on backwards. The jam-letter Nan wrote hums under my cuff, sugar drying into a map of an instruction neither of us read. I lick my thumb and press it to the fabric. The shape lifts, slick and obedient, the way sugar does when it is asked in the old sentences, and I put my thumb to the arch just where the inspector\u2019s hand does not reach.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to smear a sandwich on a monument,\u201d Hallam says, clinging to irony because it is cheaper than hope.\n\n\u201cJam is a contract,\u201d I say. \u201cAsk any grandmother.\u201d I do not say that sugar is older than bells and fractions and sometimes older than men. The stone takes the sweet, sucks it up in a slow, greedy inhalation, and the air relaxes a notch like a muscle unclenched. For a moment the bricks remember market days, noon marked by a bell and a hungry man counting his coppers before choosing which pie to buy. The clock, soothed by a memory that didn\u2019t belong to it five seconds ago and now absolutely does, looks at its one hand in the way clocks do and decides to be reasonable.\n\n\u201cTwelve,\u201d Inspector Hallam says, an inch above a whisper, as if saying it too loud would make someone come along and put a tax on it. The clock obeys like a horse that was always going to, and then makes a big show of having thought of it first. A single deep note goes out into the street and people startle in that small communal way that proves we are an animal. The second note follows, a hair tired, but sure enough that pigeons rethink their previous engagements. By the time we are at six, a bus driver wipes his eye and blames the wind. At nine, the boy with the apple yesterday I thought would go bad grows up a year and doesn\u2019t know why his pocket feels lighter. At twelve the inspector relaxes her belt hand as if only then has she discovered she\u2019s been holding herself from falling.\n\n\u201cIt wanted thirteen,\u201d she says, bleakly delighted. \u201cWhat sort of city grieves for a number.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sort that was promised a thirteen and told to behave,\u201d I say. \u201cWe put our dirty numbers in the attic. He\u2019s bringing them down and making them sit at the table.\u201d I could say his name and invite him into the conversation, but there are days you choose to leave a place between you and the story you\u2019re not ready to say aloud.\n\nAround us, Lincoln performs normality like a piece of music it plays very well. The small crowd remembers it has separate errands. A young woman puts her ear to her phone as if listening will make the words appear. The man with the returned hand flexes a lot in ways no one will make fun of because there are ages at which happiness is permitted to be obvious. Inspector Hallam releases her belt and you can see in the line of her shoulders how much of her day is the labor of not letting the world know what she\u2019s lifting.\n\n\u201cWhat did the jam say,\u201d she asks, adjusting her cuffs as if they are responsible for her composure.\n\n\u201cThat you could expect a letter without a stamp,\u201d I say, because Nan\u2019s sugar handwriting speaks in courtesy phrases no postman respects. \u201cDon\u2019t open it unless the floor of the room is wearing shoes. If the letter hums, hum back. If it hums louder, put it under water.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you and she share a subscription to a poet,\u201d she asks, no heat in it. \u201cWhen I go back to the station, what do I tell men who like nouns that sit still.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaintenance,\u201d I say, and that word has become today\u2019s coat for a hundred things no one signed up for. \u201cTell them a pin came loose in the clock and you tightened it and if they don\u2019t believe you send them to me and I will charge them double for the look on their faces.\u201d\n\nShe does smile, properly this time, and then it goes away because there are particulars. \u201cHe was here,\u201d she says, not looking left or right.\n\n\u201cHe is always two streets away,\u201d I say. \u201cHe has a way of standing in a place you can count and reaching through to the one you cannot. He will have been under here. Or he will have told a kind man to stand under here at the right hour and shake hands with the arch and call it a civic duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am getting tired of other people\u2019s kindness being used as a weapon,\u201d she says evenly. \u201cIf you see me arrest a courtesy, look away.\u201d\n\nA gull goes by with authority under its wing. The clock decides the morning can have another kernel of obedience and settles. I press my hand to the stone one more time and the stone has the decency to remember my weight. It gives me a small push like a big brother with children to save. The glove remains in the air where a hand is not, which is a debt I will have to talk to later. The man whose hand came free puts down a tenner on a bench because you pay something when you get away with a thing in this city, and a teenage boy with the good sense to leave it alone leaves it alone.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take your eyes off bridges,\u201d I tell Hallam, and we both know I mean more than concrete and river. \u201cIf you find ropes where ropes oughtn\u2019t to be, don\u2019t put a hand on them. Call me or Nan. If you can\u2019t call either, sing and then count your teeth.\u201d\n\nShe nods as a woman learns to nod when the world stops advertising its sane parts. \u201cGo,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore I give in to the warm impulse to take you to a station and make you fill in a form until you die and I can plant you under a rhododendron. My men are going to arrive in two minutes with measuring tapes and decide everything is seasonal.\u201d\n\nI go, because she told me to and because there is a sound in the ground like a string discovered to be cut and trying to decide whether to pretend otherwise. The glove under the arch twitches, offended to be abandoned; I return, make a shape with my mouth that promises later, and the arch, smug, settles its own dust. Even city monuments will keep your glove if you let them, and everyone knows an arch in a mood can hold a pocket for years.\n\nHigh Street is full of the reasonable lies we tell one another to keep the hours from keeling over. A woman in a red coat is offering her dog a biscuit as if asking him to sign for it. The brass band that isn\u2019t there warms a trumpet in the air. I meet Evie halfway to nowhere good and she steers me to the kerb by main force of aproned determination.\n\n\u201cThe bell sulked,\u201d she reports, breathless in that competent way that makes you forgive her everything. \u201cThe till laughed at a joke which is worrying given I didn\u2019t tell one, and then a man bought a sandwich with a coin that had a bishop on the wrong side. When he left the door didn\u2019t catch him, which offended the door, and I told the door it could have a biscuit later. Tell me I\u2019m not babysitting objects.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re running a creche,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying not to teach them the wrong swear words. Keep the bell under sugar. If a man with chalk on his cuffs comes in and asks to buy it, sell him a scone and tell him he\u2019s allergic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could put it on a shelf next to the keep cup that tells lies,\u201d she says, and her eyes are tired and kind, which is the worst of it. \u201cYou look better for having run. Or worse. Either way you look like a verb. Nan sent word you did a thing with a wire out east. Do not tell me it cost you nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cost me the easy hour,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever liked that hour much anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou liar,\u201d she says gently, and shoves a wrapped bun into my pocket without asking permission because she is a woman who understands where pockets sit in the grand scheme. \u201cIf you see the inspector tell her I will testify that the milk went wrong at ten past and righted itself at half past. She can put it in a chart and frown.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will instruct her to frown only at even numbers,\u201d I say, and Evie rolls her eyes at being courted by the kind of language that avoids its own club.\n\nPast the Stonebow the city opens its throat to traffic like a choir. Down by the river the swans resume their practicing for sainthood. I mean to keep off the water as if it is a man I promised not to call, but my feet remember which way the fields are and I take the long route that lets me pass the Roman bit and the so-called haunted shop that is haunted the way a dog is haunted by the idea of being a cat. On the corner there is a letterbox with a mouth like a frog; a paper pushes itself against the slot without a stamp and I put my hand out because of course it is for me.\n\nThe envelope is the sort of white that gets its way. There is no address on it, only the impression of having known where it was going longer than I\u2019ve been alive. When I tilt it, the light decides whether to be friend or witness and comes down on witness. I do not open it in the street because I know better than to let a day see itself become a bad habit. I slip it under my coat where letters don\u2019t behave and walk until my hands stop pretending they belong to weather.\n\nNan\u2019s kitchen receives the envelope with the same air it receives all awkward relatives, which is to say it makes it sit on the chair with the wobble and watch the sugar. The cat is elsewhere making a case for being necessary. Nan knives butter as if the butter is a man who has written letters and taken their replies and she will not be impressed by either. I lay the envelope on the table and neither of us admits to having held our breath.\n\n\u201cIt hums,\u201d she observes after a minute has had the courtesy to pass. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019s pleased with itself. The humming ones that are proud are a different trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can drown it,\u201d I say, and she snorts because that is the kind of foolishness we permit ourselves while the kettle finds its voice.\n\n\u201cYou can read it like a man reads a map while walking,\u201d she says. \u201cOpen it and keep one finger in your own name. If it tries to pull, bite it. If it sings to you, match it on the low end. We\u2019re not here to make a duet.\u201d She pushes a saucer of water toward me with the gravity of a woman giving communion and nods at the envelope as if to say she\u2019s done her work and the next clumsy bit is mine.\n\nThe paper peels back like skin. Inside there is a single thin page, the colour of a bruise, which is a deliberate choice I don\u2019t feel like praising. Ink has to be coaxed out of it; the words don\u2019t sit politely, they come toward you as if they have opinions on your weight. I keep my little finger tucked under the long bar of the H in my name and make my mouth say a poem I learned by accident when I was fourteen and trying not to count the same field twice. It is a good poem for letters sent by men who don\u2019t buy stamps.\n\n\u201cMr. March,\u201d the letter says in a voice I hear regardless of my eyes, and it is the sort of voice men pay to have teach them elocution and the sort of voice that has never once apologized for the shape of a table. \u201cWe are taking the pains to correspond because it saves everyone the ugliness of performance. Imagine me in my coat, if it pleases, and if it does not, imagine me without it, if that pleases more. I have seen your work with the anchors and the mutes and I commend you the neatness of your patch. It will fail, of course, but we must be grateful to the small graces as they burn.\u201d\n\nThere is a taste of chalk at the back of my tongue, exactly as if I have licked a blackboard to prove a point and found it disagreed. The letters rearrange themselves as I refuse to admire them.\n\nHe continues with that soft poison he prefers. \u201cIt is unkind of me not to ask after your cold, but you seem to carry it like a pet and I would not insult a man\u2019s beloved. I write today to tell you that your Cathedral has learned a new word and the word is apart. You will go to her, because it is what you do, and you will be turned sideways and made to stand in a long room with no walls where the idea of falling has been rehearsed with some care. If you wish to avoid the discomfort, avoid the north door. Go west for a spell. Speak to no one who stands with two shadows. Tell Nan Pearce to bring her jam and her ten names. I am being generous in my warnings. We will have an hour, perhaps two, of sport before the weight returns to you. Please be dressed.\u201d\n\nNan laughs in spite of herself and in spite of me and in spite of Rook, because he has accidentally been funny which is the most human sin he commits. The laughter lands on the table like bread. The water in the saucer ripples as if something under it moved a tail. The letter hums, smug, and I push it into the saucer in a gesture I would like to pretend is casual and is not. Ink curls up like hair. The page pushes against the water like a moth against a window and then relaxes with a sigh that does not belong to paper.\n\n\u201cHe does love to be admired,\u201d Nan says, wiping her knife, which is cleaner than it has any right to be. \u201cHe imagines he is taking something from you when he writes your name nicely. He wants the Cathedral to tell you apart from yourself. It will try, and you will stand it for a minute because you like to see your bones in mirrors as much as any man does.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will go west,\u201d I say, as if that is the plan when we both know the plan is to go where the teeth are and put my hand where I\u2019ve been told not to.\n\n\u201cYou will go how you were made,\u201d she says, buttering bread with a firmness that brooks no argument. \u201cEat, because you\u2019re going to have to do an old thing in a new way and that takes a stomach. Take my name in your cheek and your father\u2019s in your fist and the boy\u2019s from the bridge in your pocket and if the building calls you a liar tell it to get in line. If Rook puts his hand out to shake, you spit. Not because it will save you, but because your grandmother is watching and she\u2019d be cross if you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich grandmother,\u201d I ask, because it is the sort of luxury we allow each other when the hour is doing maths without us.\n\n\u201cThe one with the dead bird,\u201d she says, and we leave it at that because there are rooms in a house that open only if you pretend they\u2019re not there.\n\nI take her name and fold it under my tongue where it stings in the way of hard sweets you\u2019re not supposed to crunch. I put the boy\u2019s coin in my left pocket so that if I have to throw it I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t mean to. I go west because I said I would and because sometimes I have to teach myself I can do as I\u2019ve been told in order to have any authority when I refuse.\n\nThe west of the Cathedral is the part that thinks about weather and graves and the slow progress of mushrooms. The door there has a humility the north one cannot be bothered with. It sits low in the wall as if admitting to being made by hands and opened by them and closed by them and not by some fancy arrangement of levers that looks like a prayer. I press my palm to it and for a long breath the wood is indifferent to me. This is a relief. If indifference would save the world I would be its greatest champion.\n\n\u201cNan Pearce,\u201d I say, and the wood takes a polite interest. \u201cSilas March,\u201d I say, and it tests my name in its grain and doesn\u2019t spit. The latch lifts itself as if it is making up its mind whether to entertain. Inside, the smell is less honey and more wax. The light is late afternoon even though it is not. Things in the west of a building like this are always a little behind and a little ahead. The floor here remembers kneelers more than footsteps and my knees itch with the memory of other men\u2019s prayers. I stand very straight out of respect for those who deformed themselves by faith.\n\nA woman sits two pews in and two to the left, because that is where women sit who have more to say than they will. Her hair is the colour of the wire loop and her hands are careful the way hands get careful when they have carried the rope too long. She does not look at me and I do not look at her because this is one of those times when looking is a question neither of us is ready to translate. The place she is sitting is where a keeper would sit if a keeper were tired and wanted to pretend to be a parishioner before going back to her post.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she says finally, and there is the smile in it of someone who has been waiting longer than years admit.\n\n\u201cThe clock argued,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you\u2019re the woman I think you are, I brought you nothing you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a pocketful once,\u201d she says, and her voice is the sound a rope makes in hands. \u201cOf stones that thought they were good for drowning and then learned the wrong lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you go to the sea,\u201d I ask, because I am not kind enough to avoid the questions that unhook men\u2019s jaws, and she is not as fragile as men told us she was.\n\n\u201cBecause the hill here is not a cliff,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause some things have to be done where the world remembers to become a line. Because he put his foot on my floor and said please in a voice like a boy who had been told very often that he could not be stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you mean to unbind him,\u201d I ask, and even as I say it I taste the idiocy of the grammar of blame.\n\n\u201cI meant to hold him until someone else took the other end,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd no one did. I am so very tired of being the only knot. I went to the water because I thought the sea would be the kind of mother my city wasn\u2019t being to me. She was kinder than people say and less interested than I needed. When I walked back I was a letter with no stamp and men didn\u2019t stop throwing me through doors until one of them stuck.\u201d\n\nRook loves a wound he didn\u2019t cause. He puts his mouth to the edge of it and tells everyone how tasty blood is and you\u2019re grateful to him for naming it. I can feel him somewhere in the organ loft waiting for me to choose a note he has saved specially. He has brought us to the nave twice in two days and that means he is impatient or bored or bored with being patient. I drop the paper boat Evie gave me on the flagstones because sometimes you have to make an object remember its nature in public to give the room an example. The boat shivers, which is ridiculous because boats don\u2019t shiver in draughts, and then slides very slowly toward the tomb of a bishop who owed too much money and learned to be liked anyway.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made a room with no walls,\u201d the woman says, and now she looks at me because there is no longer any point in pretending she might be talking to herself. \u201cWhere boys practicing being men can go and think they are hero enough to change the air. He has told them the measurements of the door that isn\u2019t there and then said it\u2019s a test to see who deserves the name of man. When a boy fails he is so grateful to call himself a coward he goes home and works twice as hard at hurting the next person who asks him to try.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the door,\u201d I ask, which is the wrong question but the only one I have room for with all this grief pressing urgent at my ribs.\n\n\u201cWhere the choir stalls used to be before a man decided there was no music in them,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere the stone remembers being water. Where your hands go when you think about falling.\u201d\n\nI set my hands exactly where she says and it is there, the feeling of a threshold the height of a man\u2019s habit. It runs under my palms like a cat deciding whether it knows me. The backward bell is louder here, not in my ears but in my teeth. If I step, I will step into the long room with no walls and the sense of falling that is not the thing itself but the rehearsal of it until the day the curtain rises. I think of the boy on the bridge and his desire for a line to make his two halves even. I think of Evie\u2019s bell sulking under sugar and the way the till laughed even when it wanted to refuse. I think of the arch and the glove and Jam as contract and fences as suggestions and the number thirteen as a child sent upstairs.\n\n\u201cIf I go,\u201d I say, because it is a habit of mine to narrate my own cowardice, \u201cI might not bring my weight out with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t,\u201d she says, \u201csome other boy will go and leave his weight in your place. There are no new debts. Only unsettled ones.\u201d\n\nI step because I was always going to, and because I would like, one evening in a city that does not expect miracles, to sleep before midnight. The long room isn\u2019t a room. It is an agreement between two ideas that have ceased to be on speaking terms. The floor is not floor. The ceiling is not ceiling. Sound finds a way to get lost here and then pretends it was meant. A ladder goes down without going up and when I look over my shoulder I can see my shoulder at an angle it has no business being seen. The three-beat ring taps my ribs like fingers. The space smells of chalk, of summer rain on stone, of tinder that someone won\u2019t admit is stacked against a door.\n\nRook is not here, which is worse. There is a boy, though, because there is always a boy in rooms men planned for themselves. He is older than the bridge boy and younger than the man whose hand I returned and he has a face that has been practicing not being soft. He looks at me the way boys do when their mouth wants to say father and their sense wants to say man and both fail and they say, because they have to say something, \u201cAre you supposed to be here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, which is the most honest answer to most invitations. \u201cNeither are you. What did he tell you this room was for.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo make it fair,\u201d he says, and his lower lip does that little hold men teach it to do so they won\u2019t bite it in front of strangers.\n\n\u201cWhat does fair look like to you,\u201d I ask, and he blinks because he\u2019s never been asked to draw a picture of a word he uses to stay standing.\n\n\u201cLike nobody asks me to carry anything and then shout at me when I drop it,\u201d he says finally. \u201cLike the sky not choosing. Like the ground remembering how to be ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019re in the wrong room for that,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is the room where things that decide they\u2019re tired of their jobs come to petition for new titles. If you leave a thing in here, it will write its own name on you. That\u2019s the only fairness you\u2019ll get.\u201d\n\nHe swallows with the enthusiasm of a man learning to like bad medicine. \u201cHe said I could leave my fear here and walk out clean.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told you a story a man told him and forgot to think about what the fear eats when you\u2019re gone,\u201d I say. \u201cIt eats whoever comes in next with his mouth open.\u201d\n\nThe paper boat slides past us and we both watch it in spite of ourselves because there is something absurd and civil about a boat minding itself on stone. It turns once, entirely pleased with its decision to be a boat in a place that would rather be a corridor, and comes to rest against a line that isn\u2019t on the floor. Where it touches, for an inch, the room remembers edge. It is not much. It is enough.\n\n\u201cStand there,\u201d I tell the boy, and he stands there because even boys who have been taught to refuse authority will obey certain voices in certain rooms where the wind doesn\u2019t behave. \u201cPut your hands in your pockets and hold nothing. If the room gives you anything, refuse it. If your own body offers you falling, tell it to mind its own business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do,\u201d he asks, bravado losing ground to curiosity like grass being eaten by a river that swore it would behave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be polite,\u201d I say, and I take out the coin and the thread and the cheap brass key and the prayer that never belonged in any book and the last of Nan\u2019s name sugar that I kept under my tongue to be stubborn with. I lay the thread on the idea of floor, not crossing lines because lines are sensitive. I put the coin on the place the paper boat kissed and the coin stays, which is rude and useful. I set the key upright and tell it to imagine a door it would enjoy opening for the rest of its life. The key considers loyalty and decides to try. I spit, because some days spit is as good as Latin, and the room flinches, which is not pretty but is progress.\n\nThe long beat tries to play itself on my ribs and I refuse to be an instrument. I count in sevens because that is a number that behaves badly without being dramatic about it. The room, offended, attempts to count in threes with a lag, and we have an argument that would make a musician cry and a mathematician leave the house. Inspector Hallam would glare this room into admitting it lost the paperwork. Evie would give it a bun and charge it double. Nan would put jam on the first step and tell it not to eat in bed. I am alone with sugar and a boy and a paper boat and my hands, which have always been too cold and too full and too good for trouble.\n\n\u201cMr. Rook,\u201d I say finally, because it is not an incantation if you enjoy it, and the room perks like a dog whose name has been misused. \u201cYou built something rude in a place that prefers courtesies. You forgot to tell the building good morning. I would be grateful if you would take your cutlery back to the kitchen and wash it yourself. If you\u2019re determined to tip the table, do it where women aren\u2019t eating.\u201d\n\nHe isn\u2019t there, but he hears it, because the next breath the room takes tastes of chalk and pride and a boy\u2019s shame that has been scrubbed with someone else\u2019s hands. The three-beat stumbles on its second and then finds a different staircase. The paper boat tips and rights itself with the dignity of a thing that refuses to be mocked by physics. The coin vibrates a fraction; the key leans toward a door it prefers the smell of. I push the sugar into a line with my thumb and the room\u2019s mouth makes a noise that is the bell trying to ring backward and finding itself, to its surprise, unwilling.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d I tell the boy, because sometimes you are allowed to give an order without tinsel. \u201cWhen someone offers you a room like this again, ask them if they can smell their own feathers burning. If they say yes, leave. If they say no, leave faster.\u201d\n\nHe hesitates, his courage wanting a souvenir, and I give him the paper boat because it has behaved, and because I am not a man who can carry any more small brave things without putting one down. He cradles it as if it will leak if held wrong and vanishes through a door that isn\u2019t there unless you know its name. The room and I consider one another. The beat, no longer lagging, returns to where it belongs, which is not in men\u2019s teeth.\n\nWhen I step out, my weight is beside me like a twin and I have to coax it back on. The woman with the wire hair is gone, as women are when they have said their part and found the men around them unable to take remark as instruction. The west door opens to me with the diffidence of an acquaintance who has liked me for years and is embarrassed about it. Outside, the day is a colour that ought to have a name and never did.\n\nRook is halfway down the close under a yew, his coat trying less hard than usual because he wants me to see the shape of him under it. He applauds, as if the Cathedral asked him to behave, and we both have the grace to be embarrassed in front of so many dead. There is a boy at his side with a mouth that has said no today and liked the sound of it. Rook bows to me as if there were silver between us on a low table and we were both pretending not to count it.\n\n\u201cPoliteness will be the death of us,\u201d he says, almost mellow. \u201cDid you open my letter near water. It improves the bouquet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI opened it where a woman can reach it with a knife,\u201d I say, and he laughs because he cannot help praising the right lines when he hears them sung.\n\n\u201cYou tire,\u201d he says, not with triumph or pity, but with the clinical curiosity of a man who has never had a fever in a house with a broken fire. \u201cEat. Sleep. Bring your small green threads. Tomorrow we will do something more interesting. The Moor Gate remembers her name. Perhaps we will go and unfasten the idea of town and country and let them marry for an afternoon. The city is trying to balance her own books and I have a pencil she will enjoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNan says you were built of failed wards,\u201d I say, because I long ago gave up applauding men who admire themselves for their own injuries. \u201cMake your own and stop borrowing ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re only yours because you were more stubborn on the day,\u201d he says, not denying the wound and not shamed by it. \u201cI am going to teach your Cathedral a better thirteen. When you come up to stop me, bring salt. Your salt is honest in a way I can\u2019t afford to be.\u201d\n\nHe flicks something at me with two fingers and I have, to my everlasting disgust, the quickness to catch it. It is a nail, small, bright, with a head like an eye that would prefer to be closed. It is very light in my palm and then very heavy and then reasonable, as if remembering itself. He smiles like a boy in a school photograph whose tie is not properly done. The yew behind him drops a single berry out of spite.\n\n\u201cPoliteness is a door,\u201d he says, and his mouth softens briefly on the word in a way that makes me want to kick him. \u201cI am holding it open for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go through after you,\u201d I say, and he inclines his head as if there is any chance of our ever walking the same room without breaking it on purpose.\n\nHe goes, not into shadow, not into some conjuror\u2019s puff, but around the corner where men go when they don\u2019t want to be seen leaving. The boy with him glances back, his face uncertain where to put its anger now the man with the coat has taken his share of it, and I give him nothing, because I cannot keep feeding every stray anger that finds my doorstep. The nail looks at me. If I put it in the wrong place, the city will refuse to hang its picture straight ever again.\n\nNan is where she always is when you need her to be and never where you expect when you want to be scolded. Her door opens when my foot hits the second stair because we are not people who waste time pretending we didn\u2019t hear steps. The kitchen has decided to be warm out of sheer spite. The cat thinks the nail is food and then thinks better of confessing to that thought.\n\n\u201cHe sent you a card to use on his table,\u201d she says, giving the nail a look we usually save for men who want to teach us backgammon. \u201cDon\u2019t put it anywhere that thinks it is made.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do I put it,\u201d I ask, which is the question I should ask more often and don\u2019t because pride has a particular set of manners I haven\u2019t unlearned.\n\n\u201cIn your mouth,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere it cannot find purchase and where it will learn what words are for. Hold it till your spit knows its name. Then spit it somewhere that won\u2019t admit to having a floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will cost me,\u201d I say, and she nods, uninterested in my martyrdom.\n\n\u201cEverything costs,\u201d she says. \u201cToday I paid with the last good pot. Tomorrow I\u2019ll pay with an apology I do not mean. Stop acting surprised and you\u2019ll save us all time. Evie is bringing stews. The inspector is bringing serious men with strong words and small listening. Eat first. Then go up to the north door and have your argument. Make it a quiet one. There are children trying to learn that numbers hold still long enough to be counted.\u201d\n\nI fit the nail under my tongue the way I did with her name. It tastes metallic and adult and I do not enjoy it. It sits there, sulk incarnate, and confesses nothing. I take my bread and stew and am rude with both because I am a man who needs to be cheered on by soup. Over the rim of a chipped bowl we plan nothing and everything in that efficient way of two people who have learned that plans are what the day eats for lunch. When I go back out the city puts its hat on straight for me and I hate it a little for trying to be brave on my account.\n\nUp at the Cathedral\u2019s north door the mouth is no longer ajar; it smiles with all its teeth. The air coming through has the politeness of a doctor telling you a small operation will make you more yourself. I put my palm against the wood and my hand, to its great surprise, remains attached to my arm. The bells remember noon like a rumour they enjoy. The long line you only hear if you have been listening for it your whole life pulls a fraction tighter under the hill.\n\nThere are men gathered in the close with equipment that resents being made to work outdoors. Inspector Hallam is among them not looking like one of them and making them work anyway. She meets my eye with a look that saves my life a fraction, which is all anyone can ask. Evie arrives with a pan and a grin and no apology for the way her hair offends churches. Nan\u2019s cat is nowhere and everywhere as cats are when the night has decided to rent itself to men who use pencils.\n\n\u201cEverything we do now we do for one hour,\u201d Nan says at my shoulder, not being there and yet speaking. \u201cAfter that, we have to pay again. Don\u2019t waste it. And don\u2019t you dare be dramatic. It sours the milk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be brisk,\u201d I say, and the door laughs, which is an unsettling sound to hear from wood. It opens as if bowing the way kings think they know how, and there, inside, are the shadows for us to argue in and the long muscle of a building that has decided it will be loved even when we are bad at it. The nail tastes of the word no. I tuck it where I won\u2019t swallow it and step over the threshold before the city can change its mind and pretend it did not ask me to do any of this.The nave receives me like a well-bred host behaving as if the mess is none of mine and all of theirs. Light arranges itself into polite ladders that do not reach the ground they promise, and the cold under the stone feels held there rather than being a natural state. The air is full of unspent ringing. It\u2019s the particular density a bell leaves in a room when it has decided not to speak but cannot resist inhaling as if it might. The nail sits under my tongue like a guest with an antique grievance, tasting of iron and a schoolroom where the chalk wrote long after the lesson dismissed.\n\nI keep the westward truth in my pockets and the northward lie in my mouth and walk with the care of a man crossing an unmarked ice pond. My shadow misbehaves at the edge of a pillar, splitting at the knees the way a promise splits when you try to turn it into a rule; I step forward and the halves consider me and reunite out of embarrassment rather than loyalty. It is the quiet that tells me where the fault runs. In a place like this, silence is a ledger. The entries do not add up. They have borrowed against the future.\n\nThe rope to the bells hangs in its well as docile as any beast in harness, but I can feel its fibers remembering a hand that told it thirteen and meant it as a kindness. My palms itch with the old recognition of wear. The rope has a way of seeing you when you look at it that makes it difficult to pretend you aren\u2019t the sort of man who was born to put his hands on things that move cities. I stand with the courtesy of a drinker facing the tap, say both names\u2014Nan\u2019s first, mine second\u2014and the rope settles its own small pride and looks away.\n\nSteps curl up toward the ringing chamber with that indecent mean streak spiral staircases keep for men in a hurry. The climb smells of oak, bat-dust, and half a hundred centuries of men making numbers behave by force of arm. I count and do not count, that old habit of mine that saves me when the angles go wrong, and feel the lag in the three beat trying to drag my feet behind me by the laces. The nail under my tongue hums when I pass the place where a rung tried to make itself into a door. I salivate from the pain of it, which is what it wants, and refuse it, which is what I want.\n\nAt the turn before the chamber, the air heaves. It\u2019s the sort of breath you hear in a theatre when the curtain sticks and the audience pretends not to be delighted. There\u2019s the long room again, not here but built into here, a slice of sideways hammered into the stair where the brickwork ought to be doing its one job. The handrail is a suggestion. The step is a sentence that cannot remember its verb. I plant my shoulders against both walls and remember being small enough to wedge myself in tight spaces because there was winter and there was a mother counting cupboards like they were friends.\n\n\u201cNone of that,\u201d I tell the stair well, and the stair well has the nerve to mind. The nail tastes of hot coins. There\u2019s no floor in the wrong place to spit on and nothing more offensive to this trick than being denied its own conditions. So I give it what it can\u2019t refuse. I bite down on the nail until my mouth is a bell of pain and spit as if I am rude in a house I respect, into the angle where air has decided to pretend to be load-bearing, and the spit strings in a bright line that the light cannot make up its mind to notice. It touches what does not exist and makes it show its face, a ripple of grey like a memory finding paper.\n\nThe room shivers, as much as rooms can shiver without doors to hold them together, and evicts itself from the stair with the sulky dignity of a cat leaving a party. The lag in the three-beat fails to find a place to put its foot and misses, once, then decides to march because stubbornness is old and has its own weather. The climb resumes being a climb. I go on, breath small, hand trailing the wall in that old thief\u2019s habit I like to pretend is a craft. When I reach the ringing chamber the light is wrong in a different, better way. It is quiet here and honest about it.\n\nThe bells wait like sleeping oxen. The big one has that imperial belly that makes men say names and women think about bread. The quarter bells hold their tongues in the particular manner of those instructed to watch their betters and report any impropriety. I touch nothing. Touch is the last resort. Instead I do the work my grandmother taught me under a table when men in coats too good for kitchens had gone home. I lay the last of Nan\u2019s sugar on the rim of the bell mouth in a line so fine the air has to try twice to taste it. Sugar remembers every mouth. Sugar is not fooled by rank.\n\nIt is ridiculous and that is why it works. The bell breathes out as if someone has pulled a bodkin from its corset. The big bronze throat finds the pitch it meant for noon and carries the faintest echo of a thirteenth in its mouth like the shadow of a tooth. My jaw aches with the nail; my tongue knows its name now and hates it, which is correct. Below us, the city cleaves in, listening for an hour that is not yet promised. I can hear Evie in my head scolding her till and the till making up its mind. I can feel Inspector Hallam stand very straight and place her hand on stone as if stones only behave when touched by people with tidy pockets. The bell thinks and then chooses. The choice is half mine and half the building\u2019s. I am not vain enough to claim more.\n\nThe first strike goes down the stairs with the controlled inevitability of a bowl passed from hand to hand. It is a sound thick enough to eat. It is a word spoken in a language the ground respects. Between the second and the third the old lag lifts its lazy head and finds no place to lie because I am there with the nail and the sugar and the habit of standing where things are supposed to be and saying so. I do not ring, which would be presumption. I attend, which is the work.\n\nOn the fifth strike a voice from the ladder loft above and the organ shadows makes that agreeable little noise people make when they have been served exactly what they ordered and were not expecting it. \u201cYou never disappoint me by being precisely what you are,\u201d Mr. Rook says conversationally, and it is his worst trick, that conversational tone in a place where everything else is trying to be a prayer. He doesn\u2019t make himself seen because he is a coward in that particular way men get who are certain they could win any argument but dislike discovering they won it for the wrong reason. \u201cDid you ruin your mouth for me. I am touched beyond the worth of the metal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will invoice you,\u201d I say through iron and spit, because we are a nation of men in trades and this is my dignity. \u201cYour bell won\u2019t take your extra. Go count somewhere without ceilings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will teach her to like rooms with no roofs,\u201d he says mildly. \u201cAnd men who do not need them. But this, oh, this is charming. I had feared you would be all winter; I find instead you are a good July storm: harsh, productive, and liked by small boys who want their shirts off. Will you come up when you\u2019ve convinced her to be obedient. I have a view I am enjoying immensely and would hate to enjoy alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNan says we are not men who go up when called,\u201d I say. \u201cThrow your view down if you want to share it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNan says a great many things,\u201d he replies, and there is that flicker of actual affection in it, which is the reason he gets away with so much. \u201cWe will speak later then. Make sure the twelfth is honest; she hates a liar more than I do.\u201d He withdraws himself the way a scent withdraws when a door opens, simultaneously present and offended at being asked to be obvious. The chamber relaxes, which is to say it stops reserving all adjectives for itself.\n\nI stand with the bell until it is over, because leaving before all twelve have completed is like walking away from a table before your host has lifted his glass. When the last note is still a taste on the air and not yet a word in an ear, I take the nail out of my mouth and hold it up where the dust motes might adjudicate its guilt. It\u2019s slick with spit and something else only bells carry. I do not put it away. I put it between my fingers and let my weight remember it again, the way you let a coin remember being spent.\n\nDescending is worse than climbing. It always is. The trick with a city like this is remembering the ground isn\u2019t something you reach; it is something that reaches for you when you are polite enough to stop pretending to be exceptional. At the bend where the long room wanted to be I find the evidence of it in the way of a bruise: a slightly cooler patch of stone, a draft in a place that has no permission for drafts, a shadow behaving as if someone has told it a secret and it is dying to be asked. I tell it to mind the weather and go on.\n\nIn the nave, men with tripods pretend they are cousins to men with ropes, which is a terrible family lie but one that keeps their hands busy. Inspector Hallam has set herself where she can see the north door and the verger, and the verger has set himself where he can insist the inspector is wrong but not say so out loud. Evie finds me as if I were a man with a plate at a buffet and she a woman who knows he will skip the greens. She pushes a wooden spoon at my chest and I eat because she made it and because I am going to faint otherwise and I am too old to enjoy fainting.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do to your mouth,\u201d she asks, which is another way of asking whether the bells are going to be untrue tomorrow and whether she should wheel out the good cakes for people who comfort themselves with sugar at bad hours.\n\n\u201cI kissed a nail,\u201d I say. \u201cIt will not be a habit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it a habit and I\u2019ll stop giving you buns,\u201d she says, which is the most serious threat anyone has made to me today. \u201cThe door smiled. I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s learnt to be pleased with itself,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019ll be worse in an hour. We\u2019ve bought us that hour.\u201d\n\nInspector Hallam arrives without clicking, which is her own trick. She looks at the spoon in my hand with the particular disdain of a person who does not enjoy watching men be comforted in public and also always feeds people first when she has them in custody. \u201cIt sounded like an hour,\u201d she says. \u201cDoes it mean we can walk through one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means we can choose which,\u201d I say. \u201cTell your men to photograph nothing. Pictures will make it shy or vain. Neither is useful. Ask them instead to describe their feet and write down everything they left out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have them draw,\u201d she says crisply. \u201cHave you a list for me for when he does his next trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cBridges, chimneys, anything that runs a line between two things and calls itself useful,\u201d I say. \u201cIf someone offers to help you carry something up a set of stairs, refuse him. Rook is tickling the part of us that thinks lifting is proof of affection.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a very modern man,\u201d she says, bitterness so tidy you could put a stamp on it. \u201cAnd the Moor Gate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Moor Gate is going to ask us to remember her name,\u201d I say, and the ache behind my eyes is not the bell and not the nail, it is the long habit of a city refusing to say who did the work. \u201cWhen she does, don\u2019t tell her she was wrong. Just stand where she can hear your breath and let her count you. That part, at least, she is allowed.\u201d\n\nShe leaves me the way competent women leave dogs: with a pat that means both good work and do not jump up. Evie refills the spoon because she is also a competent woman and hates men who leave soup in the bottom of a bowl. The verger gives me the face gracious men give troublesome nephews at funerals, and I give it back, because the failure to exchange courtesies is how cities rot.\n\nThere is a letter in my pocket that is now water and ink in a saucer on Nan\u2019s table, and yet I can feel its shape as if paper could maintain the privilege of being solid after being drowned properly. Rook said the Moor Gate remembers her name and wants to be wed to country for an afternoon. He imagines it will be charming, like a festival where men bring pies and the pigs are dressed in bows. He has never stood on the path east of town and listened to hedgerow silence long enough to understand that field and street are married already and their argument is the only song we can afford.\n\nI have taken eight steps toward the north door before I realize I am walking again like a man who has forgiven the universe and that this cannot be allowed. I stop and test my weight the way a man tests a rope he has been given by a stranger. It holds, but the give in it is new. Nan\u2019s breath comes down a draught as if the house has turned its chimney into a telephone again. \u201cIf you can put the nail somewhere he cannot find, do it,\u201d she says, and I can hear her checking her watch by the heat of the kettle. \u201cHe\u2019ll prefer a maw. Give him a throat. Your choice.\u201d\n\nThe place inside the Cathedral that has a throat and denies it is the crossing, where nave and transept kiss and pretend it is on the cheek. Men put stones there and call them innocent. The city puts all her weight there because she knows what she\u2019s doing. If I give the nail to that mouth it will cost me my articulation; I will spend the next day talking like a man who had his tongue replaced by a coin. If I do not, Rook will find a knocker and teach it a new door.\n\nI am tired of choosing the expensive good, and this, above all, is why I must do it quickly. I walk to the crossing as if I am going to admire a saint and kneel as if I am going to apologise. There is a little seam where masons whose names I will never know kissed their work together and called it perfect because the man counting pennies frowned. I put the nail to my lip as if anyone is watching and might be fooled into thinking this is devotion, and I whisper my full name into the iron. I add my father\u2019s, because he is the sort of man whose name holds well in the mouth, and the boy\u2019s from the bridge, because he will need to learn what his name weighs. I put Nan\u2019s on last as you do the apron after everything else, the guarantee the day won\u2019t stain your skirt.\n\nWhen I push the nail into the seam I feel nothing and then a rush of every hurt a city runs its hands over and calls weather. It\u2019s too strong, that old grief, the raw end where the break happened. It could make me kneel all day. I refuse it and do the stupid little practical things that keep men upright. I look for the chip in the stone that will catch a nail head and hide it. I look for the scrap of old wax where a candle ran and a woman scolded and a sacristan blamed heat. I look for the long lost thread from some clerk\u2019s cuff that will keep a secret better than a saint. They are all there, because this is Lincoln, and old carelessness is our finest store. I tuck the nail in where it is least likely to pretend to be a story and most likely to pretend to be infrastructure.\n\nThe floor lifts its shoulder under my palm and returns to being the thing it always wanted to be, which is not a sermon and not a poem and not a trap. The long line I have always heard under the north door comes into tune with something over my left eye, which means we have an hour, and I can stop being a man full of craft and begin again being a boy with habits. I sit on the step near the font and shut my eyes because this is a gesture the building knows how to grade.\n\nWhen I open them, Mr. Rook is sitting on the edge of the font like a village groom too pleased with his own cuffs, his coat hung open in the manner of men comfortable with their sternums. He did not walk in; he is simply having been there for a portion of the morning we were not previously assigned. There is chalk on his fingers as if he has been teaching a child to draw ladders and has praised the boy for finding a way to climb without touching them.\n\n\u201cYour mouth,\u201d he says approvingly, which is another of his indelicacies. \u201cI did not believe you would do it. You are more devoted than your reputation allows. If I were a church I would envy the pew you warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have bad taste,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s a relief to be petty. \u201cGo home.\u201d\n\n\u201cHome is wherever the slope is steeper than it was an hour ago,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cDo you think you can keep this up for the week. It is a week, I think. That is what the sums told me when I pulled the old knot out at the Moor Gate. Seven days of the city refusing to be put down gently, and then the stammer takes, and then perhaps we are all new. Or very old. I can never tell which word is the right one for the things that matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can count to seven,\u201d I say. \u201cTry counting the people you hurt to get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey count themselves,\u201d he says, and he almost sounds wounded and I hate him for being good at that. \u201cI never had to teach men to put their hands in dangerous weights. They live for it. They call it love. They call it civic duty. They call it God.\u201d He leans forward, the water in the font forgetting to be water for a moment and remembering being mouth. \u201cDo you know why you make me polite, Silas. Because you are the only man I meet in this country who knows when to say please to a stone and mean it. I cannot decide if that makes you a fool or a king.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnots don\u2019t care,\u201d I say. \u201cThey care whether you keep them in use. You untied the wrong one. Tie it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot,\u201d he says, and his honesty is a blade you can cut fruit with. \u201cI am not the kind of body that can make that knot any longer. The keeper who could is in salt and patient. The next one has not been allowed a rope. We will have to do what we always do when we break something we need: improvise. It will be artistic. I am excellent when I am cornered. Do not you long for that kind of excellence.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s the first true no I have permitted myself today. \u201cI long to buy carrots from a man and know that they are carrots and not an apology I am supposed to admire. I long for the clock to ring at the hour and the city to do the brave labour of pretending. I long for Evie to go home at three and be useless to men for two blissful hours. Your excellence can go and sit on the step until it stops demanding applause.\u201d\n\nHe grins like a boy who has found the one teacher who won\u2019t be charmed, and for a moment he is very handsome, and I remember the first time I saw him and felt my back go straight because I wanted him to like me which is the one thing about me I have never forgiven. \u201cCome to the Moor Gate,\u201d he says softly. \u201cBring your inspector and your girl with the clove breath and the woman with jam. Bring the boy who spit when I told him to be a man. Let us see if we can make a vow that doesn\u2019t cut an ankle.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d I say, because there is no point in not making the appointments men like him have arranged. \u201cAt dusk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt dusk,\u201d he repeats, making the word taste of honey and wrong decisions and the old trick of making evening feel like a wedding. \u201cDo not be late. The field is poor at waiting. It begins to grow things when left alone.\u201d\n\nHe gets up and walks exactly the three steps he\u2019s allowed before the building refuses to pretend to have doors where he needs them. He smiles at the stone for being reasonable and vanishes into a shadow he has had prepared for him from the beginning of the week. I exhale, which I had forgotten how to do with any ownership, and the nave puts itself in order with a sigh like sheets shaken out by a careful woman.\n\nWhen I come down the steps of the north door the light has moved left the way it does when you\u2019ve been inside a narrative longer than your body advised. The men with tripods have already decided to believe their photographs and fold their chairs. Inspector Hallam has already found a woman who will say she saw nothing and is trying to make that into a statement for a court. Evie has already put a bun in my pocket and told me if I don\u2019t eat it in ten minutes she will find a way to make my coat disgraced in public. Nan\u2019s cat appears from the bit of hedge that enjoys pretending to be brick and regards me with the respect due to a man who did a thing with sugar and didn\u2019t die of shame.\n\n\u201cDusk,\u201d I tell the inspector, and she doesn\u2019t ask for where because she has been a woman long enough to know that when a man says dusk in a town like this, there is only one where. \u201cBring men with rope and the old woman who tells ropes their manners and no one who will feel they ought to draft a press release afterward.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring a constable who grew up on the moor and pretends he didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cHe knows the names of birds that don\u2019t admit to living here. And Evie.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvie is self-invited,\u201d I say, and Evie nods, not in the manner of a woman invited but in the manner of a woman who has already put on her boots. \u201cNan will be there whether there is a door or only a suggestion and we will pay again, because we have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake your payments small,\u201d Nan says in my ear like the steam off a kettle. \u201cCoppers. Buttons. Promises you can afford to break without wishing you hadn\u2019t. He will try to make you spend notes. Tell him you haven\u2019t been to the bank.\u201d\n\nI walk down the hill not because I need anything at the bottom but because the hill needs reminding that I\u2019m here and will be again after I have pretended to sleep. Along Steep Hill the windows sugar themselves the way they do for tourists and witches. The butcher\u2019s sawdust is fresh and disguising nothing at all. A boy with a kite under his arm walks as if it has promised to behave; it has not. A woman in a yellow coat counts pigeons and comes to a number that does not comfort her and decides not to mind.\n\nAt home I wash my mouth out with tea and then with water and then with a swear word. The nail has left a shadow inside my cheek, which is absurd and exactly the sort of thing men write letters to doctors about and then throw the letters away because the post office cannot be expected to understand. I put my cheek to the cold window and the glass tells me the temperature of the day without language. A letter without a stamp would have felt loud in my pocket; there is none. The house tilts a fraction toward the west as if listening to the fields in anticipation and I tell it not to be rude.\n\nAfternoon is a waiting room. It is all the wrong magazines and a carpet that resents indoor shoes. I go to the market because men with knives there don\u2019t ask you to say why your hands are shaking; they ask if you want bones for broth and what you plan to do with the leeks. I buy carrots for the man who thinks he hates God and he looks at me as if I\u2019ve admitted to something indecent and in return gives me the one that is shaped like a Y, which feels like a blessing if you\u2019ve been in a tower this morning. I leave a coin under the bench where the apple went bad yesterday and a small girl finds it and hands it to her mother with the gravity of a magistrate.\n\nBy the time the hour grows toward dusk the city has put on its other face. The students are out practicing ambition. The gulls have taken their awful poetry to the river. Men who might have once enjoyed being told what to do wonder what it would be like to ask the evening for a favor. At Nan\u2019s door I take the jam saucer and the name that is not mine and the biscuit I will not admit to needing. She presses my hand and I let her because there are days when I do not have to earn it.\n\nWe walk east not in a procession but with the air of people who have all remembered the same story at once and intend to check the last paragraph was as they recall. Inspector Hallam strides like a woman who has had practice looking as if men with opinions don\u2019t ruin her shoes. Evie walks with a pan as if it were a shield. The constable from the moor has his hands in his pockets and his mouth thinking about thrushes. There are boys following us who think they are not, and Nan allows it because letting them think they invented themselves is part of her sport.\n\nThe path to the Moor Gate is always shorter when you tell someone you know where it is, which is the path\u2019s way of keeping pride. Hedges receive us like a congregation that isn\u2019t sure it approves of the sermon but is fond of the choir. The ditch holds its iron to itself. The stone circle looks less like a circle today and more like a set of teeth in a mouth that forgot to close. The hollow has more in it than light and less in it than water. Rook is there, of course, because punctuality is a courtesy and he will have all of them as long as we insist on playing at the front door.\n\nHe is hatless, which on him looks like the page of a book you weren\u2019t supposed to find, and the coat has resigned itself to being decoration. Around him men stand who have been told they are useful in a way that will encourage them to tell their sons to be less soft. A woman stands with them whose wrist I met this morning sitting like grief, and she has a rope coiled at her feet in the way of a lover who knows how to be patient and dangerous in a good order. The field smells of old fire and July rain and whatever it is that lives under chalk.\n\n\u201cLadies,\u201d Rook says politely, and he means it, which is why Nan curtsies just low enough to ruin his confidence for a minute. \u201cGentlemen. Worlock. Welcome to the afternoon married to an idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo vows without witnesses,\u201d Nan says, and sets the saucer in the grass where the loop of wire once was. \u201cNo rope without hands that know names. No ring without someone to say this is a bad idea and we will do it anyway.\u201d\n\nHallam steps to where I told her before she was told, because a woman like her hears the instruction you lay into a day before you realize you\u2019ve spoken. Evie stands with her pan as if it were a bell in its own right. The constable takes his hands out of his pockets, which means the moor has accepted him for the evening.\n\nRook is all grace, the worst kind, the borrowed sort. \u201cWe will speak each where we stand,\u201d he says, as if he has invented prayer. \u201cWe will ask the town to loosen its belt and the field to put on a coat. We will look for the line between and ask it to be a table for once.\u201d He looks at me with that intimate interest that has made the lives of better men difficult. \u201cYou will tell your city not to be afraid. You are very good at that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell her she is allowed,\u201d I say, which is as near to kind as I am capable of toward a man who has made the day into a classroom.\n\nThe rope is very old and very new. It smells of hair and hemp and winter laundry and men\u2019s wrists. The woman with it lifts it without drama, and I know before she speaks that she is a keeper whether she was given a word for it or not. She looks at Nan and something passes that is not jam and not tea but is the heart of those. She looks at Inspector Hallam and something passes that is not a warrant and not a pardon. She looks at me as if I am the posture of a thing she has had to carry and is deciding if I am worth it.\n\n\u201cWe will do this the ugly way,\u201d she says. \u201cWe tried the pretty way and it cost the wrong house a son. Stand where you belong. If the ground gives you a word, keep it. If it gives you a weight, do not pass it to any child. If Mr. Rook asks you to shake his hand, spit. If the city asks you to say her name back to her, say it with your mouth and not with your bones.\u201d\n\nRook bows, delighted, because he thinks he invented ugly. He draws the rope along the line where the hollow decided to be an old pond and we discovered it had ideas. He makes it look like a dance, which is a lie. The rope hisses against stone the way sugar fizzes in tea when you wanted it to behave. The hedges lean. The tiny birds that never get named because people name only the birds they kill or bound look all at once in the same direction and then at their own feet.\n\nI am no longer cold by then, which is wrong. My hands are their own temperature. The beat under the north door is not under the north door anymore; it is in my chest, where it can do the least good and the most damage. I think of ladders down wells and the peculiar hope of an end that is also a beginning and how that hope is the only thing a man like Rook needs to ruin a county. I hold the shape of my name in my mouth like a marble and wait for the field to decide whether to be polite.\n\nIt is the Moor Gate that speaks first, because she has aged badly and is not going to be talked over by a younger Stone with less experience. She does not say words. She rattles the bony bit of the landscape. She knocks four times on an old board and coughs. She asks us if we remember the winter where a girl with a red hat counted sheep into the fog and never out again. She says the numbers: three with a lag. She says them as a warning and a brag.\n\nRook tugs his coat straight like a boy in church. \u201cThere,\u201d he whispers, as if someone might take offense. \u201cThere. She remembers. Now the fun part.\u201d\n\nHe means the part where he gets to play at being the man who never gets to be a keeper and never had a rope offered to him and has made the world pay for it. He means the bit where he persuades the town to step down from its hill for a minute and trial walking flat, and the bit where the field is allowed to climb without being told to wipe its feet. He means the kiss that isn\u2019t one and the vow that cannot be kept without something else being thrown away.\n\nNan coughs like a warning under a hymn. I take the saucer of jam in both hands and draw the line where I cannot see it, the mean small circle that keeps big foolishness from convincing itself it\u2019s universal. The woman with the rope nods, once, to me, and once to Hallam, and once to Evie, because she understands what kitchens have done to keep the world from collapsing. On the rope, under Mr. Rook\u2019s fingers, there is a tremor as if a fish has remembered water and decided to sing.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d the keeper says, and her voice is not mine and not Rook\u2019s and not the city\u2019s, it is the moor\u2019s, and we obey because there are moments when disobedience is the wrong kind of art. The weight comes up under our feet as if the field has decided to be generous. The town declines a fraction as if relieved of a duty it took on without consent and is discovering that consent is an art too. The air in the hollow flips like a coin.\n\nFor a breath, only one, I feel the whole thing tilt. It isn\u2019t dramatic. It\u2019s domestic. It\u2019s the difference between a table that\u2019s set and a table that\u2019s been cleared, that mysterious lightness that lives in a room when the plates are gone and the questions are about to sit down where dinner was. Rook laughs softly, delighted, because he thinks this is the proof the world wanted, and for him it is, and for me it isn\u2019t, and for the moor it is a relief.\n\nHe pulls. The rope answers. The city makes a noise I have only ever heard in men\u2019s throats when they have been told at last that it is not their job anymore and they can go to bed. The field makes the noise cows make when the gate opens and they were not expecting kindness. Men on the line confirm to themselves that they are strong and useful and required. It is a terrible sound and a beautiful sound and I would like to drink water. I do not move.\n\n\u201cKeep your feet,\u201d Nan says. \u201cKeep your names. Keep your tempers.\u201d\n\nThe rope bites Rook\u2019s hand at the place where a man\u2019s pride lives and he enjoys it because there is something wrong with him that cannot be cured by a mother and a clean kitchen. He calls out a number that is a lie and the rope tries to learn it. The moor hisses like rain, refuses, and insists on its own counting. The inspector says noon into the hedgerow like it owes her a favor and the hedgerow is so surprised it offers her four. Evie bangs her pan, which is the sound of a bell that does not want to be a bell, and the field accepts it as an argument.\n\nI feel the north door under my feet again. I feel the Stonebow in the place where my left wrist goes when I am trying not to hit anyone. I feel the Roman gate sharpen its knife against an old complaint and put it away because today is not for ancient slights. I feel a ladder somewhere that does not lead to any of this at all and that scares me more than anything else in the afternoon. I take a pinch of salt and throw it over my shoulder with the incorrigible superstition of a man who has already spent too much cleverness.\n\nRook looks up from his rope like a man interrupted in the very act of being himself. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he says, mildly cross. \u201cI haven\u2019t made the invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe field made it for you,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re late to your own party.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate that,\u201d he says, and his teeth show for a second as if the boy under the coat has decided to come out and kick a can. He pulls hard. The rope strains. The moor laughs, which is a frightening sound if you are fond of furniture, and the town remembers its weight all at once and decides to keep it.\n\nThere is a sound like a bell trying to ring backward and the rope snaps out of his hand as if hive bees live in it. The keeper catches the coil with her hips and her history. Inspector Hallam\u2019s man from the moor puts his shoulder into air where air needs a shoulder. Evie drops her pan on purpose and claps because sometimes you encourage the room like a child. Nan says a word that is neither Latin nor housewifery and the hollow fills with the idea of water and then changes its mind because she asked nicely.\n\nIt is not a victory. I am not so cheap as to call it that. It is the art of an hour\u2019s permission. It is the way a gate is persuaded to close at dusk so the sheep will do the labor of staying alive themselves. Mr. Rook shakes his offended hand with good humor because what else can he do. He bows to the keeper the way a polite burglar bows to a dog that didn\u2019t bite. He looks at me with that expression he reserves for the moments when he is most dangerous: amused, impressed, a little hungry, and with the ruins of a boy\u2019s longing behind his teeth.\n\n\u201cYou will run out of sugar,\u201d he says. \u201cYou will run out of names. You will run out of boys who spit. I will still be here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will run out of you,\u201d I say, and it is not bravado. It is fatigue. It is love. It is the hope that makes a poor superstition an honest skill. \u201cAnd the city will still be here.\u201d\n\nHe inclines his head as if I have said something he is saving for later, to throw back at me when he wins, or to remember when he loses. He steps back and the rope makes a face at him that is not human and very familiar. He laughs. He vanishes. He does not go into the hedge because the hedge would not have him. He simply disappears into the gap you rent when you refuse to be ordinary long enough and the afternoon forgets to charge you.\n\nWe stand and do not do the thing men do after exertion, which is make noise and pretend they meant the noise to be laughter. We breathe. The keeper unwinds the coil with the air of a woman taking her hair down after a funeral. Inspector Hallam puts her hand back in her pocket and her steadiness takes a bite of the evening. Evie picks up her pan and licks jam off her thumb with a wickedness that redeems gardens. Nan looks at me as if I am a piece of furniture she loves and is going to scold for letting itself be scratched. The field decides to be field again with the serene self-respect of a body rebuttoning after trying on someone else\u2019s shirt.\n\n\u201cHome,\u201d Nan says, because she knows what to say when there is nothing to say. \u201cEat. Sleep if you can without making a mess of it. If you dream, tell no one belonging to the church. Tomorrow has plans for us. We will plan nothing and be ready for everything and do it while the kettle thinks about boiling.\u201d\n\nI walk with Evie for part of the way because the river would like to admire her, and it never hurts the river to be taught its manners by someone who gives away buns against her better judgement. We do not speak of rooms without walls. We talk about the idiocy of men who refuse change for breakfast and eat it at lunch. We talk about the Inspector\u2019s hair and whether it was always that serious. We talk about whether the cat belongs to Nan or Nan belongs to the cat, and I am kind enough to suggest the paternity may be shared.\n\nAt my door the key clears its throat and behaves. The house admits me with the wary hospitality of a creature that has been visited by a man who means well and leaves dust. I put my hand to my mouth to test whether I have stopped bleeding from the inside where manners live, and it is only sweetness and metal and the taste of the bell\u2019s courtesy. On the table there is something not a letter and not a tool: a white feather in a circle of blue thread, the fleck of gold caught in the twist. It is not a message from Rook. The handwriting around it is no handwriting anybody living bothers to learn.\n\n\u201cThree,\u201d it says in that script objects use when they forget how to be quiet. \u201cBut teach her to count seven on her fingers and forgive herself the lag.\u201d\n\nIt is the Cathedral\u2019s idea of a joke, or the city\u2019s idea of a kindness, or the moor\u2019s idea of a dare. I put the feather in the jam saucer and the thread over the windowsill where the cat will find it and misbehave. I sit, and the chair chooses not to creak because small mercies are the ones that take you by surprise. It is dusk. It is the hour courtesies lick their thumbs and press down the corner of the page so they can find their place again in the night.\n\nI do not sleep yet. I make the night tea and tell it not to gossip. I wash my hands with the seriousness of a surgeon and the superstition of a dock worker. I stand at the window and look out at a city that has forgiven me my weight for a day and will use it again tomorrow whether I want to be used or not. I take the coin from the bridge boy out of my pocket and put it on the sill and tell it to watch for footsteps that do not belong to anyone. It shines, which is all any of us can do with the hours we buy at the price available. I put my head down on the table and for a minute or two I know how to be ordinary, which is a spell I will never learn to cast on purpose, and then the bus sighs past and the house shifts and the bells remember the quiet they earn, and I am ready to be taken by the kind of sleep that does not teach me anything and is therefore a gift.Morning decides it will be generous and arrives with both hands open, as if I have earned a day that doesn\u2019t need to test me before it will sit down. The feather in its circle of blue thread has crusted a little with jam where I set it, gold fleck caught in the twist like a moth that chose its trap. The word it left behind\u2014three\u2014has not moved off the table, which is a comfort because there are words that go walking when your back is turned. I drink tea that pretends to be practical and tells me I look better in a kitchen than the night lets on. The coin from the bridge boy watches the window like a doorman with standards. The house has given back the inches it tilted yesterday toward the fields and resettled its shoulders as if it closed a book at the right place and remembered where it put its glasses.\n\nIf I were a man who made lists, today\u2019s would be a mean one. Seven acts, small enough to pass for courtesies if anyone asks, heavy enough to make a building change its breath. The feather\u2019s joke is a dare; the Cathedral counts in threes with that tired lag and needs teaching a different meter, not because seven is holy and three is common, but because the wrong men have been flattering the wrong number and an honest alternative would do everyone good. Nan told me once you can teach a house to keep time if you braid seven strands of something it already loves and hang them where drafts call themselves customers. I do not have seven strands of anything except habit and worry. Both will have to serve.\n\nNan\u2019s door opens before I knock, which is not courtesy so much as a woman deciding time spends better if it is used for bread and not formalities. She has a biscuit tin older than three of my decisions sitting on the table and within it the city\u2019s version of thread: seven things that never go out of fashion. A button from a school cardigan that held a boy together in winter. A safety pin that pretends it is a small sword. A stub of pencil bitten smooth by a mother who did not have time to be angry. A twist of hair tied with red string. A spent match that remembers a candle better than the man who lit it. A washer from a bolt that kept a gate honest. A postage stamp with no country on it that has nevertheless delivered very important messages between hands.\n\n\u201cUse these,\u201d she says, not romantic about any of it. \u201cYou can leave sugar everywhere until the day closes its teeth on your fingers, but if you want a church to follow you when you change the pace, give it the syllabus it understands. Work, children, rope, fire, door, letter. If he borrowed our wards because his own failed, we will borrow everything back and call it laundry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll need stairs,\u201d I say, because the first time you teach anything it is good to be above the room where your work collects. \u201cAnd a dislike of drama.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake my dislike,\u201d she says, and I put it in my pocket with the rest of my uncharms. \u201cIf anyone says the word ritual in your hearing before tea, make them carry the coal. I\u2019ll see to chimneys. He has ears up them. They listen where they should breathe. The inspector will take the arch. Evie will discipline her door. You will start with the bell\u2019s second cousin and remind her to be content with being a kind of mother.\u201d\n\nInspector Hallam arrives in that tidy manner that makes men stand up even when they promised themselves not to be impressed again. She looks at the button tin, registers without moving a muscle that we are going to nail the day to the table with small things, and tells me the Stonebow would like to be reassured before lunch that it will not have to learn to pronounce thirteen after all. Evie comes in on the weather; she has a pan under one arm and a ledger under the other and the pan is the one she will use to censure any bell that forgets itself.\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Evie says in a tone that makes the room put its shoes on, \u201ca man with two shadows bought a coffee and told the sugar to behave. It did not. He left chalk on the counter in the shape of a ladder that goes down.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak to no one standing in two shadows,\u201d Hallam says crisply, reminding both of us that she listens to our letters even when we do not want her to. \u201cIf they stand still, move. If they move, hum. The humming makes them admit they are only one person after all.\u201d\n\nNan smears jam on a saucer and writes seven on it with the knife until the number remembers what it is for. She breaks the day up like hard toffee and hands us our pieces. I take the Cathedral, because my name has been threatening to be married to its stairwell for years and I may as well see how the domestic arrangement looks in daylight. The inspector goes to her arch with a man from the moor whose job is to know what silence weighs. Evie returns to her till with the fervour of a woman determined to reassure a door it is not a mouth. Nan vanishes in that way she has where you can still smell tea and feel your hair being combed and yet also know she is halfway across the city muttering instructions up chimneys and warning them not to eavesdrop when it is not their turn.\n\nInside the Cathedral the air is the colour of melted coin. The big spaces would like to be impressive and get over with it so they can be comfortable again. I go the slow way, past the quiet corners where wood teaches patience and stone learns to forgive knees, and I lay a lesson in seven parts where no verger needs to write me into a logbook. Under the misericords I tuck the school button, because boys have always learned here to hold still and sometimes they should be allowed to keep their pockets. On the step up to the choir I pin the safety pin into a crack where it can pretend to be a hinge and hold two songs together, one for the living and one for those who cannot carry a tune anymore. At the font I leave the stub of pencil in the lip where history nibbles and makes remarks, because if you do not give a church something to write with, it will use your bones.\n\nI thread the twist of hair into the rope where fingers calluses grew before mine, murmuring two names and a third I will never say out loud, and I feel the long beat in the city shrug and shift its weight as if something it had decided not to mind yesterday has decided to be minded today. On the north transept\u2019s doorframe a spent match slides into a flaw that has trapped worse tempers and seems content to behave. At the west door I set the washer where the light can use it to pretend it is a coin and pay for its own entry. The stamp I take up the stairs to the ringing chamber and stick beneath the beam with spit, because a letter that remembers travel in its skin might make a bell remember sending and not just calling.\n\nThe seventh thing is always the one you do not plan for. At the turn where the long room once put its shoulder into the stair, a girl with a choir book is standing with all her attention in the place her second shadow is trying to be and not quite managing it. She is ordinary in that exemplary way of people who mean to be, hair pulled back by the world with elastic, fingers inked by the notes she copied when somebody forgot the photocopier had a song of its own. She looks at me without fear or expectation and I like her immediately because she has not learned yet to perform panic for men to rescue. Her second shadow is a neat little lie, offset by a long inch to the left, impatient with the wall.\n\n\u201cDo I have to ask who you are,\u201d she says, which is neither rude nor pious and leaves me nowhere to play a part.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the man who is about to ask you whether you have slept,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd then tell you it isn\u2019t a test of character. Your other shadow is waiting to see if you\u2019ll turn your head so it can get in behind your eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that work,\u201d she asks, as if she has half a mind to let it try, because people are kind to even their own traps if those traps have good posture.\n\n\u201cIt makes you hum a note no one else can hear,\u201d I say. \u201cIt turns kindness into a performance and then offers to sell tickets. What\u2019s your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cRos,\u201d she says, frowning at the step as if the step has asked an impertinent question about her shoes. \u201cRosamund when my mother wants to talk about money. I had a dream where the stave was missing a line. I came to look at the organ as if it could apologise.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, and I hate how stern it comes out and do not take it back. \u201cDon\u2019t look at it. Look at me. Hum me a seven.\u201d\n\nShe tries, fails at four because the city puts a foot out to trip her, laughs without permission and tries again, this time in that stubborn small way that takes the day and pins it to the board by the corner. The second shadow misses its chance and sits down like a sulky child because it has been denied the drama it needs to be interesting. I stand on its second mouth with my heel until it forgets the words it was going to put in Ros\u2019s mouth, and when she finishes the seven in a crooked time that I envy, the stair gives up being a corridor to nowhere and remembers how to go upstairs.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I say, which is more than praise and less than comfort. \u201cIf anyone offers you a room without walls, ask them where the coat hooks are. If they say honest rooms don\u2019t need them, leave.\u201d\n\nShe nods like a person who owns two good nods and has given me one and is saving the other for her mother and a conversation about money and choirs. On my way down I feel the building try the seven and fail and try again and put the lag in a different place where it can\u2019t break as many ankles. I don\u2019t know if I taught it anything. I know it is listening.\n\nI am out of small things and twenty minutes richer when the telephone that does not belong to me rings in a patch of cold by the north door. The effect is so barefaced I want to scold Rook for clumsiness and then I hear Hallam\u2019s voice finding a way to be brisk without becoming unkind. She has a chimney that has swallowed a Monday and is now trying to push a Wednesday down the flue to compensate. The woman whose house it is is using a jam jar as if it were a rosary. There is a wolf in the sound the child\u2019s room is making, but not a wolf from here. She tells me to bring salt and whatever it is I bring when I pretend to be sensible.\n\nThe house is the sort that wears brick as if it\u2019s a cardigan and checks the pocket for change when men are not looking. The woman at the door wears grief on her wrist like a watch and relief on her mouth like a swear word. The child has arranged her toys to face the fireplace in the understanding that if something is going to come out, it is polite to be looking at it. The wolf is in the drag of the draw. It isn\u2019t a wolf. It is a man\u2019s trick taught to a chimney to make it appreciate being a throat. I kneel and lay my hand flat on the tile in front of the grate because chimneys lie when you touch their bricks but tell the truth to floors.\n\n\u201cMr. Rook,\u201d I say to the living room, because I am tired of couriers who pretend to be furniture. \u201cYou have to borrow smarter than this. There are children in this house and the jam is better than you deserve.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t answer, which is polite for a man who cannot resist himself. The flue lowers its voice as if to lean closer with its ear. I take the sugar line out of my pocket, the last little grammar of it I scraped off the ringing beam with a nail scraped off my tongue. I lay it across the hearth like a seamstress telling cloth the truth about itself. I whisper the seven under my breath in the sort of rhythm men remember from trains and bad hearts and the long walk to a job they love. The wolf in the noise stops pretending to be a wolf and confesses to being wind. Wind is a poor liar when its cheeks are full of smoke and it knows it. The jam jar trembles and stops and my mouth fills with the taste of a park in summer when someone opens a flask and says the right names in the wrong order and suddenly everyone\u2019s feet have rhythm again.\n\n\u201cPut salt in your pocket,\u201d I tell the child, who is seven because of course she is and smiles like a person who was born tired of being lied to. \u201cIf the chimney talks again, tell it a recipe. It will listen. Chimneys are all recipes pretending not to be.\u201d\n\nOutside, Hallam has rung her men off and allowed herself one second of standing with her head against the brick as if the wall is her friend and will not gossip. The constable from the moor hums something that is either birds or a tune his grandmother taught him when the kettle was on and the world was a size smaller. Across the street a man laughs too loudly at his own joke and the laugh comes back with someone else\u2019s timing and he looks at his shoe as if it has, at last, betrayed him.\n\n\u201cYou said seven,\u201d Hallam says as we walk, not touching, which is our custom. \u201cWhat is seven for you. We have officers who cannot get their heads around it and a mayor who will get out his pen and write seven in a speech as if that will teach the river to time itself for photographs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven is the number you use when you need a stubborn hour to sit,\u201d I say. \u201cHe is making three trip over itself. I can either pick up the three and move it, or I can put a seven down until he gets bored. He will get bored. He is a boy with beautiful manners. Boys like that never keep a toy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say boy with the care of a man trying not to pity,\u201d she says, considering not me but the air in front of us as if it owes her money. \u201cTell me if I should pity. I will do it in private if it\u2019s required.\u201d\n\n\u201cPity is expensive,\u201d I say. \u201cSave it for widows who have lost Monday.\u201d\n\nAt the coffee shop a door is being disciplined with charm and a cloth. Evie\u2019s chalkboard has found itself right side up without anyone embarrassing it in public. The bell under the till has sulked itself into a mood and now it sulks of its own accord, which is a safer place for sulking. A man with two shadows stands outside long enough to be told the door is busy and then leaves with a face that would like to complain to a manager. Evie flips a cup in her hand and tells me to stop letting my mouth look like a sentence that will disappoint a school.\n\n\u201cHe came in,\u201d she says, not lowering her voice because there is no use. \u201cHe asked for milk and then told the milk to think about snow. It tried. I put a spoon in it and told the spoon about ships. We made peace. Then he stood where he could have two shadows and didn\u2019t like the taste of my stare.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feed them sugar with such bad grace,\u201d I say, and she grins because she knows I mean he will come back and try harder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give him salt,\u201d she says. \u201cHe can improve his palate. There\u2019s a girl been sitting outside writing in a music book with her head cocked like she\u2019s listening to a bus that won\u2019t arrive. She looked at two boys this morning like she was trying not to love both and I thought, well, that\u2019s everyone\u2019s fault. I gave her a bun without telling her and she gave it to a pigeon without bothering to admire itself first. I thought you\u2019d like her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met her,\u201d I say, because the day has decided to be efficient with introductions. \u201cShe hums a seven you could set a floor to. If Rook has any sensibility left in his expensive bones, he will leave her alone because the first time he is genuinely loved by a room, he will not know what to do with it.\u201d\n\nAt the library the local history shelves have bred a pamphlet while my back was turned and it has the decency to pretend it belongs. I slide it out and find in it a blueprint traced by hand that is not an architect\u2019s, but a lover\u2019s, all lingered lines and corrections and little apologies written in the margins to rooms that never quite forgave. The title page is sure of itself. \u201cSeven corners to keep a tongue,\u201d it says, and I would laugh if I had anything to do with sensible air. Wren\u2019s wrong boy drew this or the man who kept him from falling long enough to teach a city to speak. The corners are not corners in any practical sense. They are the places where breath collects and must be reminded to leave.\n\nI spend an hour pencilling the day a map will allow you to pencil and not be told off. The Stonebow, the crossing, the west door lintel, the well that is dry but keeps its ladders because ladders like to be kept, the Roman arch where a knife once sharpened itself in public, the library\u2019s stairs that have always imagined they are the backs of animals, the bridge that only believes it is a bridge when boys are standing on it deciding to be men. If you put a small obedience at each and then ask the building to choose the beat it prefers, seven will look like mercy and three will look like cleverness, and the Cathedral, which was not built to adore cleverness, will take the offer nearest its original humility. I tear the pamphlet in half because sometimes you have to make a thing new to get any use out of it and tuck the half with the corners into my coat where it can keep my ribs from behaving with too much vanity.\n\nIn the afternoon when the long light makes everyone better looking than they deserve, a letter appears under the coffee shop door with no stamp and poor handwriting and too much attention from the paper to the pen that wrote it. Evie slides it over the counter with a finger and refuses to ask me to perform any more small magics than I already have; the refusal is a tenderness I do not know what to do with. The letter smells of chalk and old books and the particular dust that climbs out of organ pipes on days when the choir is too beautiful for the building and everyone agrees not to speak of it.\n\nHe does not begin with Dear. He writes like a man who has found a way to write to himself and detests the novelty of a second person. He tells me he has made a room that knows how to keep a choir together without a conductor. He says he is not going to use it on Sundays because he is not vulgar. He says he is going to teach the city to stand between beats and enjoy the hurt. He says he has remembered where the dry well is and has found a ladder that has never learned how to go up. He says tonight the wolves will hear the dead walking under the river and come to the bank to listen with good manners. He says if I am any kind of worlock I will come to the water and behave.\n\nI want to burn the letter because it will put ideas into objects and then claim the objects had the ideas first, but Evie gives me a look that is both mother and magistrate and I put it in the sink and open the tap and make the letter learn how to be a good guest. The water reads it out loud with a hiss, because it cannot help showing off, and then cannot remember a word of it. I dry my hands on a cloth that has been drying hands for a decade and tastes like butter and grief. Evie puts a bun in my pocket without pretending it is for later.\n\nAt the Stonebow the pigeon has returned to the decent clean patch and is practicing contempt for men whose hats are too proud. Inspector Hallam has the expression of someone who is going to tell the arch a story until it cannot remember the new ending Mr. Rook gave it. The constable from the moor stands like a notched stick used to measure river depth and hums softly without thinking any of us can hear. We touch the stone like men touching a horse that doesn\u2019t belong to them and ask it to count seven on its old bones. It does not, not yet, but it thinks about it and agrees to consider doing it on the hour when no one is looking.\n\nBy the time the river smells like sound and boys are practicing standing still on bridges without setting the sky on fire, the wolves are in the noise. It isn\u2019t a pack. It\u2019s the shape of hunger with a name. The dead walking under the water do not mind being overheard; they have the arrogance of tides. I take the long route past the Roman gate and the shop that is haunted by its ambition and the bench where the heart carved around D + M stopped beating after the second handful of coins and has been waiting for a man to admit it. The swans have installed themselves with their usual posture of sainthood waiting to be asked about tax. The girl with clove breath is on the far bank, a shape that knows a rope has been thrown to her whether or not she wants it, and the boy from the bridge throws stones into the shallow water with that false casualness boys develop to make everyone else forget they are practicing mercy.\n\nRook is on the quay with his coat open and his hands in his pockets like a man who gets away with everything at meetings because the chair likes his cousin. The chalk on his cuffs is deliberate. He looks like any man who has been told a story about his own usefulness and has taken it too far in the direction of kindness. He nods to me as if we are men who meet to count the receipts after a fair. He inclines his head to the river and the river ignores him in the way of dignities older than politeness.\n\n\u201cWorlock,\u201d he says with the faint admiration of someone who likes the mouthfeel of someone else\u2019s title. \u201cShall we call them, then. You like a test. I like a choir. The wolves prefer a choir to a soloist.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you whistle,\u201d I say, \u201cthey\u2019ll come with bad manners. If I hum, they\u2019ll come with better. You don\u2019t have to like the difference. You just have to admit it exists.\u201d\n\nHe smiles in the manner of men who have been complimented on their suits too often and bowed to at funerals they spoiled by speaking. He gestures to the water as if offering me a stage and I do the one thing he cannot stand: I ignore him and ask the river if it wants company. There is a foulness in my mouth at the question, like I have licked a coin again, and I think fondly of nails and spit and the sugar line, and decide to use none of them because there are days that the old tricks only please the wrong audience.\n\nI hum the seven Ros hummed because it is crooked and it owes nothing to fashion. I pitch it where the arches under the bridge keep their cooler air and the weed knows how to wave without trying to be a woman\u2019s hair. The wolves are in the river\u2019s hearing before a minute has taken off its shoes, not as beasts in the flesh, but as patience, a sharpness under stillness, an expectation the city would like to learn and cannot because it has learned performance instead. Mr. Rook\u2019s mouth opens a fraction because he cannot help loving anyone who calls the right thing by its first name without making an entrance, and I file that away for something later, perhaps when all this is a table with cups put away and a small emergency finding its way to its bed.\n\n\u201cPolite wolves,\u201d he says, showing me his clean palms like a man remembering his catechism. \u201cIf you leave them their ears, they leave you your feet. Wherever did you learn that.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom women,\u201d I say, because it is not clever and therefore it is true. \u201cAnd from hedges. And from the part of the city that does not like you but leaves a biscuit on your step because it cannot help remembering when you were the right kind of hungry.\u201d\n\nSomething crosses the bridge. It is not a person. It is the shape left when a ladder is taken away from a well and men keep looking at the aperture because looking at it between chores makes them feel like someone important might have died there and they might be asked to carry a corner of the procession. Boys stop pretending not to shiver. The girl with clove breath puts her hand in her coat pocket where salt lives and the swans decide to be statues just to see how we look when we think they cannot see us.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring the nail,\u201d Mr. Rook observes, and if he were less vain I would give him credit for pretending to be sorry. \u201cYou put it somewhere your mouth couldn\u2019t get it back and if you had a mirror I would pay to watch you tell yourself you did the correct thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rule about paying to watch men tell themselves things,\u201d I say, and he laughs in that private way where only his ribs get to enjoy the joke. \u201cI taught her a seven. She will teach herself the rest. The Wolves will mind me if I mind them. Don\u2019t you put your hand in.\u201d\n\nRook is a boy who has never been told not to put his hand in anything in public. He cannot help himself; he puts his hand in. The shape from the ladder has been waiting for that hand and intends to keep it the way a city gate likes to keep glove leather. He hisses\u2014not in pain, he would never allow himself pain in front of me, but in embarrassment, which is better. The wolves in the sound change their weight and I put mine down and we have a small argument about who gets to own the hour and the bridge remembers it has always liked the boy who throws stones and sides with me.\n\nIt is ugly, which is the correct way for some good work to be. I count backward from seventeen because numbers that are not fashionable make Rook lose the thread. I put the coin in my left shoe and the boots remember their job. I tell the girl with clove breath to recite the names of streets she has walked at dusk when she was not afraid and her mouth becomes the kind of weapon men will talk about after and wish they had learned sooner. Rook\u2019s wrist comes back with his hand attached, less from my care than from the river\u2019s boredom. He looks at me with that hot sting in his eyes he has for people who refused to admire him correctly, which is to say kindly.\n\n\u201cSeven,\u201d he says, as if it is a complaint. \u201cYou will run it like a seam until the day catches itself on a nail and bleeds on the stair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will wash the stair,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd someone will bring bread and we will sit on the steps and be ordinary for a whole minute. It will be the best part of the day and you will have missed it because you were drawing ladders on the wall.\u201d\n\nHe looks at my hands, and then at the river, and then at the girl on the far bank who has not taken her hand out of her pocket because she understands what pockets are for. He inclines his head to the wolves in the polite way a man bows to a dog that refuses food. He takes his chalk out of his cuff and breaks it in half and drops one piece into the water like a coin and keeps the other in his fist like a tooth. The wolves listen until they are done and then do what wolves do when they would prefer not to be seen leaving; they are simply not there where you look and afterwards you wonder if you made them up.\n\nWhen it is over the river clears its throat and pretends not to have been part of any of this. Boys begin to be stupid again with relief and this is a mercy disguised as irritation. The swans take up their employment with smugness that somehow does not nauseate me. Mr. Rook\u2019s hand, when he pulls it from his pocket where he has warmed it for show, is fine and he will pretend it was never in danger because that is how he manages not to die when he deserves to. He taps two fingers against the bridge rail as if that does anything here and steps away not because I told him to but because he has other rooms without walls to polish and other boys to make think they can choose the day\u2019s ending.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he says lightly, which is a threat he keeps like a flower pressed between bad pages. \u201cBring your seven and your jam and your unglamorous kindness. I will bring a number I haven\u2019t tried yet and a man who wears two shadows because one is doing a poor job. We will stand the town and the field and the river and the sky in a circle and ask them if they like one another. We will not take no for an answer.\u201d\n\nNan appears on my right where I had not saved a space for her and therefore am humbled. She smells of chimneys that have been told to mind themselves and the kind of tired that would never get caught acting like it wants applause. She leans on the rail like a woman who raised a city to be tidy and is deciding if it needs to be shamed publicly or bribed with cake. The cat finds the yew Mr. Rook stood under yesterday and leaves a pawprint the exact size of a coin on its root.\n\n\u201cYou fed him,\u201d she says without looking at me, which is both a complaint and an absolution.\n\n\u201cHe came hungry,\u201d I say. \u201cThe worst kind. The kind that knows names.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach her seven,\u201d Nan says, nodding to the Cathedral visible as a posture at the top of the hill even at dusk. \u201cTeach him nothing. Teach the inspector that being reasonable and being right are cousins that don\u2019t always speak at weddings. Teach Evie that she can close the door before he puts his foot in. Teach the boy on the bridge the words for enough. Then you may sit down and I will tell you a story about a number that was not allowed in a house and lived in the shed until it grew teeth and married the daughter.\u201d\n\nI walk home with my hands colder than they ought to be considering the hour and the kindness of the bread in my pocket. I go by the Roman gate because it likes to be called goodnight and says unkind things otherwise that make people think their shoes are at fault. In the alley behind the library I see a man whose shadow has remembered its second self too completely and the second self has begun to be bored. I cross the street because I am not an idiot and narrow my body to pass between certainty and doubt without letting either ask for my name. At my door the key does me the courtesy of not trying to be a riddle. Inside, the house remembers it is made of corners and hides its relief in the way kitchens keep secrets.\n\nThe feather in its blue ring is where I left it. The gold fleck winks like a friend from a crowded table. On the sill the coin sits on its good face and is not colder than it should be, so no one who doesn\u2019t belong walked by while my back was turned. The jam saucer is a chart of a sea we won\u2019t have to cross if we are polite to the river. In my mouth the taste is sugar and bell and a little of the iron you always keep when you have spoken honestly to a church. I will sleep, not because I deserve it, but because the city is better when I do, and the only compliment I know how to pay her is to put my head down and make room for ordinary things to get on with their work. The bus breathes. The kettle, unwatched, boils and forgives me for it. Somewhere above the street a chimney discovers it has learned a new job and is pleased as anything and no one will ever thank it and it does not mind.",

                              "content": "They say Lincoln sleeps beneath its own cathedral, that the hill itself dreams in stone. On certain mornings, when mist stripes the Witham and gulls wheel in lazy, fish-eyed spirals over the Brayford Pool, the whole city feels submerged, like a bell lowered into water. Sound changes. Light edges around a corner and won\u2019t cross a line. People walk faster without knowing why. It\u2019s a habit the place has, cropping up like moss on Roman walls: to pretend everything is ordinary until it isn\u2019t.\n\nThere are streets I know by muscle and breath. Steep Hill with its sugared windows, chocolate shops and blue-painted doors; the crooked turn where a butcher keeps sawdust in buckets and bones strung up like wind chimes; the tight little alley that could be a trick of the eye unless you look down and notice that the bricks are wrong and the light there has a tinnitus hum. Some of those streets are true. Some are only openings that look like streets from an angle. The city and I have a working arrangement. We keep each other\u2019s secrets.\n\nI go by Silas to most, unless the day is serious and the river runs glassy. Then I remember my full name, Silas March, and say it to the dark as if it\u2019s a kind of key. A worlock, if you like \u2013 I\u2019m not precious about spelling. The old women on Burton Road call me hedge-witch and wink. The students call me a street magician and would probably film me for an app if I let them. There\u2019s a man at the Oxfam bookstore who taps the counter when I set down coin and says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got the hands for it.\u201d I don\u2019t argue. I\u2019ve got the hands.\n\nThe work is mostly small. Needles threaded without looking. A coin sewn into the lining of a coat to see if it turns black by morning and whether the wife will stop dreaming about crows. A back garden where nothing will grow because a broken mirror sits at the root of a hawthorn, feeding it shine and fever. I\u2019ll trace a circle with salt and river sand, knock four times on the paving, cough, spit. Plants will be plants again. The man will make me tea that never quite warms.\n\nOn Tuesdays I visit the Cathedral, though I never go in by the front. A side door, a key that is not a key, a stone worn by fingers that are not remembered by any living keeper. It\u2019s an understanding I have with the place. We acknowledge each other\u2019s age without counting. The air inside is the kind that makes you apologize for breathing, all honey-lit and high and full of psalms. I sit under the misericords and listen for the unquiet. It is rarely the grand, gilded things who have something to say. It\u2019s usually a splinter of wood, a scrap of lead, a feather stuck in a crack, or the memory of boots at night when war made the glass rattle.\n\nOn a Tuesday in late October, the bells did not ring the hour. There was a tremor in the stone you could mistake for your own pulse if you didn\u2019t know any better, and a draft from the north door even though the wind was sleeping in the crows. I walked the nave, counting but not counting, fingertips grazing air. Behind the lectern a child\u2019s marble was lodged in a gutter of shadow where no child would have reason or height to leave it. Blue glass. It ticked under my nail like a watch and whispered three syllables that meant falling. I stood very still and didn\u2019t breathe. The syllables went away.\n\nAfterward I went to see Nan Pearce because if there\u2019s one person who won\u2019t let a whisper go without giving it a coat and hat, it is Nan. She lives in a terrace by the Stonebow where the curtains are always shut halfway, as if drawing breath. There\u2019s a cat that never blinks and a cactus that has not moved in eleven years. Nan sees me coming and says, \u201cYou smelled the bells,\u201d as if I\u2019d put the bells in my pocket.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t ring,\u201d I tell her.\n\n\u201cThey rang where they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat did the building say?\u201d She doesn\u2019t ask what the Cathedral said, mind you. Nan knows buildings like some people know their children\u2019s sleeping breaths.\n\n\u201cThree beats,\u201d I say. \u201cNot the hour. Not the day. Not the smoke alarm either.\u201d\n\nNan pours tea into mugs whose handles have been glued back on three times. She has a superstition about throwing a mug away: she says the house keeps count. \u201cSomething\u2019s waking on the long lines,\u201d she says. \u201cYou heard it. My cat woke at five-fifteen and shouted at his bowl as if the ocean was in it. The kettle boiled cold. The jam set twice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found a marble,\u201d I say. \u201cBlue. It didn\u2019t want to be touched. It said falling.\u201d I set it down on the table. It rolls away from my hand, obedient to laws I do not name, and comes to rest against a sugar bowl as if hiding its face.\n\nNan looks not at the marble but the shadow it makes and nods with the softness she reserves for broken things. \u201cOne of his, then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose?\u201d\n\nShe looks at me like I\u2019m a slow boy pretending to be a man. \u201cYou\u2019ve been smelling feathers for a week. Don\u2019t pretend. The Wren\u2019s boy. Wren\u2019s wrong boy.\u201d She shakes her fingers as if plucking cobwebs. \u201cRook.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook?\u201d The word tastes like burnt toast, black grease. \u201cYou\u2019re certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do certain. He\u2019s been wetting the edges again. You know how some men paint fences to make them look new? He\u2019s painting nights. The kind that attract things with numbers in their bones.\u201d She taps the marble. It makes the faintest sound of a bell ring backwards. \u201cHe wants the whole of it to fall, you understand? None of this messing about with cities and starlings, he wants the planet to go down like a rotten apple.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t,\u201d I say, and the words are thin, brittle like child\u2019s toys. \u201cThe lines\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lines fray. The knots come loose. You saw a knot today looking like a marble. You think what happens when a proper knot goes? Cracks through fields you never walked. Rivers wearing new mouths. Gravity getting a stammer.\u201d She leans in. \u201cDon\u2019t you tell me he can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook was bound,\u201d I say. \u201cCovens made sure of it. The east ring, the north ring, the\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you that? Men who like the shape of their lies? He was bound to the last Keeper of the Moor Gate and you know as well as I do she went to the sea with stones in her pockets. No one held the rope when she went. No one tied it to a good place. Rook learned something in the slack. I can feel him stepping on my floorboards without opening my door.\u201d\n\nI keep my face still. I have learned to keep it all still: the breath, the eyes, the pulse at the throat. It\u2019s a trick. The kind a worlock learns in a world that wants to count you. \u201cIf he\u2019s here, he\u2019s not here for me,\u201d I say.\n\nNan Pearce laughs a low laugh that makes the cat\u2019s ear twist. \u201cEveryone who has ever wanted to bring a world down has had to step through Lincoln like a gentleman who left his gloves on a pew. He won\u2019t mind you until you mind him. What did the Cathedral do when you touched the marble?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt moved,\u201d I admit. \u201cNot like a wave. Something more like... a shiver. And someone walked past and didn\u2019t see me there.\u201d The words leave a taste, iron-ish. It would be easier if I could call it a trick of light, a draught. It would be easier still to call it nothing. \u201cThey brushed my shoulder. But. Maybe it wasn\u2019t my shoulder.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere now,\u201d Nan murmurs, and it is not pity. It is another of her soft things, wrapped round something with teeth. \u201cYou don\u2019t bring that look into my kitchen without eating something. Toast?\u201d\n\nI say yes because saying no would make a noise I don\u2019t want to hear. While she rattles plates, I turn the marble between my fingers. It is the kind of blue that makes sailors promise things to stars. Every now and then, just at the edge of the iris, there is a fleck of gold, a flaw stitched hurriedly. When I hold it to my ear I hear in it the sound of a long fall into a dry place. In my head: an image of a ladder down through a well so deep the bottom has been waiting longer than memory. It is a particular kind of fear. The fear of not what is down there, but the certainty that down there is all of us, eventually.\n\nNan hands me toast with jam that glows as if it remembers sun. \u201cHe\u2019ll come careful,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019ll send runts and kind hearts and letters with no stamps. He\u2019ll send a boy who used to sit in pew three and whistle in his coat sleeve. He\u2019ll send whatever bit of the edge he can find to cut you with. Don\u2019t go to the waterside at night, Silas. Not till the bell fancies ringing properly again.\u201d\n\nI nod as if I mean it. I intend to mean it. But the Brayford at night is where the city\u2019s sleep troubles leak into the open, and that\u2019s where I go when a day makes me too tight in the shoulders. I walk, I listen to the lap of black water, I watch the swans like lost coats, I think about the miracles we have and the ones we are refused.\n\nThat night, the waterside smells wrong. Not of diesel and chip fat and the faint sugar of spilled cider, but of hot tin and rain on summer stone. A smell from another season. The lights are haloes. The swans do not sleep; they stand tall and still, necks like questions. A girl on the steps stares at her phone but does not touch the screen. I count her breaths unconsciously. She smells of clove and shampoo. There is a ring of salt around the penny she is turning with her shoe, which she did not draw. Good instincts, bad advice.\n\n\u201cYou can go home,\u201d I say to her without looking. \u201cWhatever you came to watch won\u2019t show you its good side tonight.\u201d\n\nHer head lifts slow, as if the night had to give it back. \u201cDo I know you?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the one who tells you when the river\u2019s in a state,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd tonight it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t talk to strangers,\u201d she says, but she stands up, her hand going to her pocket to check something is still there. A key? A stone? A name. \u201cMy mother said never to sit with my back to water.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour mother is wise,\u201d I say. \u201cDoes she know you\u2019re here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have the kind of mother who knows where I am,\u201d she says, and she smiles. The smile is not a child\u2019s. She has learned some things, and she has not learned others. \u201cBesides,\u201d she adds, \u201cI like the noises. Not the water. The... other ones.\u201d Her head cocks, listening. \u201cYou hear them too, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\nPeople say this to me often enough that I have an answer that is true and unhelpful. \u201cSometimes. How about we make a bargain? You go home tonight and don\u2019t come to the water again without leaving a copper coin under your left shoe before you step out the door. If the coin is cold when you pick it up again on your way back, you go back inside and make a cup of tea. If the tea tastes of pennies, you salt your doorstep and telephone your friend whom you haven\u2019t called for three months. Then you go to bed and dream about sheep.\u201d\n\nShe blinks, then laughs into her scarf. \u201cOkay,\u201d she says, surprising me by meaning it. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t dream,\u201d I say, which is true in the way a knife is true.\n\nShe leaves. I watch her go, stepping firm, the penny forgotten only to be remembered and snatched up on instinct just in time to keep the trick from filing itself away under Bad Luck. When she is gone I stand still and listen to the river come to attention. The water stills. A wind walks along the surface in bare feet. Somewhere very far away a door closes and stops the breath of a room. Another opens. It is all a kind of math that pretends to be a story. Add one. Take away ten. Divide the dark by its own appetite. See what\u2019s left.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d says a man beside me.\n\nHe is not there until he is there. Black coat, the kind that tries hard, the kind that eats light at the cuffs. His hair is the peeled edge of a crow\u2019s feather. He stands too close, in the scissored way some men do who are used to seeing their reflections flinch. His eyes are not remarkable until you want to look elsewhere and can\u2019t. He smells faintly of chalk. His hands are bare.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t coming,\u201d I say.\n\nHe smiles that small smile that belongs to a boy who set fire to a field of barley and got away with it because his father\u2019s brother owns the village. \u201cEveryone comes down to the water,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cIt\u2019s why our cities get built where they get built. The old urge to drink. Or drown. Or wash. All the same urge. The earth curling up a palm full of what we already are.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook,\u201d I say.\n\nHe inclines his head, corrects me with a little bow made of bones. \u201cMr. Rook. For the niceties. And you are Mr. March. You prefer Silas. You have hands like a promise and you carry your dead like rosary beads. Charming.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen you out in it,\u201d I say. \u201cThe night. You use softer things.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe night is soft,\u201d he says, and for a moment there is something tired in it, something old, and something like grief hidden where it cannot be stolen. \u201cIt is people who are hard. They crack the edges. They insist on corners. The night gives them none, and so they call it cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want.\u201d\n\nHe steps back as if the question has weight. \u201cOh, a little of this. A little of that. Balance. Tilt. Sky music. It\u2019s all one thing. I want to see what happens if a line we have all assumed is seed turns out to be fuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you want. You want to bring the world down. Your name has hungry in it.\u201d\n\nHe smiles again. He would be handsome if the light hadn\u2019t learned to be careful around him. \u201cDown is a matter of perspective. There are people in the south who will tell you that north is down; in the east, they say the same of west. I want to bring the planet into a new alignment for a while. Tilt it. Let the oceans remember a different shape. Let the wolves hear the dead walking. Let the stones finally speak. You can call that down, if you\u2019re fond of your current furniture.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll kill everyone,\u201d I say, but I do not raise my voice. We are not men who raise our voices at the river.\n\nHe flutters his fingers in a little shamefaced nothing. \u201cWe always say that. Whenever anything changes. And sometimes it\u2019s true. Very often it\u2019s not. People are stubborn. Hard to shake. Hard to shift. That\u2019s why you have to change the whole machine if you want to change the cogs. You\u2019ve been patching the cogs, Silas. Bless you for it. You\u2019ve been mending little holes with little thread and keeping old women from nightmares and young boys from staying too long under the bridge. And that\u2019s lovely. Truly. But the fabric is rotten. It wants to be something else. I\u2019m just going to give it its head.\u201d\n\nHe is so reasonable that I have to look away. The swans are listening, heads cocked, eyes like black beads. I say, \u201cYou know I won\u2019t let you.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d he says, pleased. \u201cYou are the city\u2019s worlock. A little prophet with dirt under his nails. Destined. It\u2019s my favorite word. I know what they\u2019ve always said of you. The candle the Cathedral kept under the poor box. The boy who walked out of an empty house with the river on his tongue and a dead bird in his pocket.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop it.\u201d My throat feels thick.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in your pocket tonight?\u201d he asks, because he likes to be cruel in little ways. He leans in. \u201cIs it one of mine?\u201d He makes a little grasping gesture toward the marble. The blue inside hardens. He closes his fingers around air, then opens them, disappointed. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t hold it that way,\u201d he remarks. \u201cIt will make your hand forget how to hold anything else.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it,\u201d I say, and it is not about the marble. It is about everything else demarcated by that line. \u201cStay out of Lincoln, Rook. Go hurt your own people.\u201d\n\nHe steps neatly around that. \u201cI\u2019ll come and go as I like. But I won\u2019t touch your little houses, not yet. I wanted to see you. To look at the man everyone believes in. So ordinary. Tall enough to reach the bell rope. A little of the river about you. So much of the north wind under your collar.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me why you\u2019re telling me,\u201d I say. \u201cYou could have done what you came to do without this conversation. You like to talk, but you don\u2019t usually do it yourself.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me then with a very gentle, very private kindness that makes me colder than the river could. \u201cI came to be polite,\u201d he says. \u201cI came because I do not want to make you frightened more than I have to be. I came because you\u2019re going to try to stop me and you won\u2019t be able to and it will hurt you and I wanted to give you this, a small thing, a courtesy. I like courtesies. We use them doormen. They open and close the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour courtesy is filthy,\u201d I say.\n\nHe nods, unoffended. \u201cIt is. But it is still a courtesy. Don\u2019t go up to the Cathedral for a few days. The stone does not want to be stepped on and your weight is not what you think it is. Tell Nan Pearce to put her hand on the chimney and count to nine and go to bed. He\u2019s listening down chimneys this week. Tell the girl with clove breath to put salt in her pocket and walk a different street. Tell the old man with the broken shoe that his shoe is not why he limps.\u201d\n\nI open my mouth to ask him how he knows, and he smiles because it is the question he wanted me to ask. \u201cI know because I do not lie to myself about what things are for,\u201d he says. \u201cI am excellent at finding the applied meaning of objects. Shoes, chimneys, girls\u2019 pockets. Worlds.\u201d\n\nHe goes then. He does not step into a shadow and vanish. He walks along the water with the half-pleased gait of a man who hears a tune most people do not like, and turns the corner under the bridge, and there is no body to follow because the corner is not the corner you think it is. The swans soften and crease themselves back into sleep. The wind goes looking for a field it mislaid.\n\nI do not move for a while, because to move would be to admit I am standing, and to admit I am standing would be to admit I have a shadow. The river does not look at me. The night keeps its courtesies. When I finally go, I walk the long way round, up by the university where the glass buildings are still trying on versions of themselves. Students spill sugar all over the steps and sleep in lecture halls. I pass a bench where someone has carved a heart around two names: D + M. The groove is clean, as if the wood has just been wounded. I lay my hand on it. The heart beats once under my hand. Twice. Then stops. I leave my coin in the notch, a payment to no one at all. Or to the math.\n\nThere\u2019s a girl called Evie who works nights at a coffee shop near the Stonebow and pretends to study accounting in daylight. She has an expression that tells you she wanted to be nearly anything else. I like her because she can\u2019t help but be kind even when there\u2019s no cost to unkind. She always gives me the last cinnamon bun for free and tells me to stop looking like someone\u2019s about to ask me for a miracle. Her hair is not a color Nature used on purpose but looks good anyway. Tonight, the shop is closing when I reach it. She resets the chalkboard in the window upside down without noticing.\n\n\u201cOi,\u201d she says. \u201cYou look like you saw a man try to talk a swan into a mortgage.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was worse,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was polite.\u201d\n\nShe looks past me at the street, which is empty but is never empty enough for Evie\u2019s eyes. \u201cYou want a sandwich? We\u2019ve got the ones with the ham and the ones without ham that look like they have ham. Also one with egg that someone gave a right telling off to. It\u2019s sad as anything. Don\u2019t take him; he\u2019ll ruin your night.\u201d\n\nI take the ham. I pay in small change that looks like it wants to be something else. She passes me a napkin folded into a paper boat. I know better than to ask questions. Evie\u2019s paper boats float where other boats would sink and carry what other boats refuse.\n\n\u201cYou hungry or just delaying?\u201d she asks, and the way she asks tells me she doesn\u2019t need an answer; she enjoys the shape of the question itself.\n\n\u201cI ran into someone,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cI hope you ran out of him as well,\u201d she says. \u201cMen look at you like you\u2019re a bet they lost and want to win back. Don\u2019t let them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019s going to roll the world on its side and see what comes loose,\u201d I say, not meaning to say it, not meaning to put the shape of it into the air in a place with cinnamon and milk foam. It sounds ridiculous here, like claiming a fox will sue you for slander.\n\nEvie doesn\u2019t laugh. She looks at the street again and then at me. \u201cWhat would come loose?\u201d she asks. \u201cTeacups. Church bells. The idea of Thursday.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople,\u201d I say.\n\nShe nods slowly as if I\u2019ve confirmed something she already half knew. \u201cYou going to stop him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say, as if I can. The word, once out of my mouth, finds a place to sit down. It looks at me. It waits.\n\n\u201cYou look cold,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI am always cold,\u201d I say, not meaning to say that either. I tuck my hands in the pockets of my coat. The marble is there, warm as a small thing that believes in being held. There\u2019s a moment \u2013 silly, brief \u2013 when I imagine folding myself a paper boat and climbing in and going down the Witham to where the city stops dreaming and the fields are simple and honest and flat as a palm. But I am not the kind of man who gets to leave.\n\n\u201cCome back in when you need your hands to stop shaking,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t stay where a door can\u2019t see you. Promise me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPromise,\u201d I say, and she knows the shape of my mouth when I do not mean a promise and forgive me anyway.\n\nI sleep poorly, too much river in me from the night, and dream not at all. In the morning the city pretends again. Children with red noses and ill-fitting uniforms pull their mothers to the school gate. Men in vans do that ballet at intersections where everyone is only slightly murderous. A woman in a yellow coat counts pigeons and is pleased when she arrives at a number that means Wednesday. I go to the market and buy carrots from a man who thinks he is angry with God but is only hungry. I watch a dog refuse to cross a line painted on the pavement that no longer exists. I do not go to the Cathedral. I go to the library instead.\n\nLincoln\u2019s library is the kind of building a young worlock can get lost in. If you stand in the local history aisle long enough the spines will begin to breathe. I pull down a book that smells of coal dust and photographs and find in it a penciled note that was meant for someone else. \u201cI hid the thing. There is no move that leaves us blameless.\u201d It is dated with a year the city does not admit to. I take the note and put it in my mouth and let it dissolve. Paper is good at remembering. If you don\u2019t break the chain, sometimes what is written keeps happening. I spit the taste into my handkerchief and fold it into my sleeve.\n\nA woman approaches while I\u2019m frowning at maps. She is the sort of person my life has taught me to dread: tidy, observant, wearing a coat that takes itself seriously, carrying a notebook with straight lines and tight handwriting. She has grief on her wrist like a watch. She says, \u201cMr. March?\u201d and it isn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cDepends who\u2019s asking,\u201d I say, even though she\u2019s already told me.\n\n\u201cInspector Lorna Hallam,\u201d she says, showing me the wallet, the badge, the clean authority that comes from being at once underestimated and in possession of very sharp teeth. \u201cI\u2019d like a word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a man with words,\u201d I say lightly. \u201cThey rent the place by the week.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had incidents,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve had birds falling out of the air and clocks talking to men who don\u2019t wear watches and a child who insists her mother lost Monday in the washing machine. We\u2019ve had five\u2014\u201d She stops herself, as if numbers are dangerous here. \u201cWe\u2019ve had several people insisting that the Cathedral changed size while they were in it. Did it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is good at that,\u201d I say. \u201cBut you know that already. You wouldn\u2019t be here if you were a woman who only knew clocks and step-counters.\u201d\n\nShe does not rise to the bait. \u201cPeople tell me your name when they think I will laugh at them and be kind afterward. They tell me your name when they are afraid to say anything else. I don\u2019t like giving fear the run of my city.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen keep it on a short leash,\u201d I say. \u201cOr let me.\u201d\n\nShe eyes me. \u201cHelp me and I won\u2019t try to arrest you for fraud and make a spectacle of you. Don\u2019t help me and I might. I won\u2019t enjoy it. But there are men above me who like to pretend spectacle is a kind of proof.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you arrest gravity for pushing?\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cI would if it started choosing,\u201d she says, and something in that makes me like her more than I mean to. \u201cWho\u2019s doing this to us. Is it you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot me,\u201d I say. \u201cThere\u2019s a man in a black coat who wants to tilt the world and see what breaks. He\u2019s picking at seams. Lincoln is seamful.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your place in all this?\u201d Her pen is poised. It is not the kind you can buy in a shop.\n\n\u201cI stand where the seam is and try not to pull too hard.\u201d I slide her the paper boat Evie folded, because I do not know why and because sometimes you do a thing without the run-up of reason. \u201cTake this. Don\u2019t open it unless you\u2019re somewhere that remembers your childhood hands. If it gets heavy, don\u2019t drop it. Put it in water and it will do the right thing.\u201d\n\nShe does not laugh. \u201cAnd what\u2019s the right thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will float,\u201d I say, which is both everything and nothing.\n\nShe gives me a look that says she will not be comforted by old men waving smoke at doorways. \u201cIf you\u2019re lying to me I will find out and I will make it inconvenient,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re telling the truth I will still make it inconvenient. But I\u2019ll thank you later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will not thank me,\u201d I say softly. \u201cNo one ever does. We do our bit of string and someone else cuts it and calls the knot a friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe ready,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I call.\u201d\n\nShe leaves. I read maps until the lines stop meaning rivers and certainty. When I come out of the library the sun has decided on a time of day and the city fits the idea like a borrowed coat. There are men with vans and women with kindness and a boy with a stolen apple in his pocket. I watch him decide not to eat it and leave it under a bench. A crow discovers it. Its beak is a small, deft blade. It is a pretty little monster in a town that makes room for all kinds.\n\nI turn up to the Cathedral because I am a man built of defiance and habit. I go round the side, breathe on the key that is not a key, and press the stone worn by fingers the city didn\u2019t keep. The door opens an inch. It does not want me. The air that comes out is Sunday, old blanket. And something else. The same three beats I heard yesterday, but with a hollow, tired lag between the second and third. A wrong heartbeat. I push. The door does not open further. For a moment I see my hand on the wood the way you see a hand on glass from the other side, a ghost trapped in a photograph waving at you from 1892. I leave my hand where it is. The wood is warm. There is a sensation of it thinking about letting me go through.\n\n\u201cNot today,\u201d says a voice behind me. A verger, small and round, mustaches like dogs\u2019 tails. He is polite. Terribly. \u201cWe\u2019ve a service.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy apologies,\u201d I say, stepping back. My hand does not come with me. It stays on the door. There is a pause. Then it comes, reluctantly, like a misbehaving child. The verger does not see it. Or he sees it and puts it somewhere for later. He smiles. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he says. It sounds like a hope and a warning.\n\nI spend the late afternoon in the Roman part of the city where the gate pretends it still has soldiers. There is a chip in one stone where someone once sharpened a knife in a hurry. There is a scorch mark where a house learned it was made of tinder. I touch the stone and think about the thing Nan said \u2013 that Rook was bound to the Moor Gate and then unbound when the Keeper went to the sea willing. I think about loose ends. I think about knots and marbles and the geometry of falling. If you drop something and it doesn\u2019t land, have you still dropped it. If a man is unweighted without dying, does he end up somewhere or nowhere. The wind gets in my collar. The sky is a dull coin.\n\nThat night I do not go to the water. I go east instead, out to the edges where the city remembers it has fields, and I walk along the hedges until I find the place where the path runs quieter than it should. There is a stone there with a scorch of lichen that looks like a map of an island everyone lost in a fire. The hedge is blackthorn and obstinate. The ditch smells of iron. I kneel. I put my palm on the soil. The earth thinks about me. It does not think too hard. It is not my business, what the earth decides. I am the wrong sort of thing for that. I can persuade. I cannot require.\n\n\u201cShow me the line,\u201d I say.\n\nThe grass leans. A blade points. A beetle climbs and changes its mind. You learn to take your portents as they come. I follow the line to a hollow where once \u2013 by the look of it \u2013 there was water. The day is too dry. The hollow remembers rain. At its center is a circle of grey stone that the tractors never quite levelled. I stand in it, and the world is \u2013 to my surprise \u2013 briefly true. The wind pulls my coat. My heart is there, and there again, and there again. Same wrong gait as the Cathedral. Three beats, with the long tired lag between the second and third.\n\n\u201cRook,\u201d I say softly, and the hollow answers with nothing. The hollow is honest. It gives me only as much as it has.\n\nWhen I get home the house has had visitors. You can tell by the dust. The dust behaves differently when a stranger crosses it. It chooses new places to settle, to better catch a footprint, to better hide one. The air is too tidy. I put my key on the table and it rolls where it shouldn\u2019t and lands where it didn\u2019t. I go from room to room. I feel nothing but the feeling of someone else deciding not to touch my things. It is an odd relief, and a worse fear.\n\nOn my kitchen table there is a note written in an ink that resists being seen. You only see it if you look between words, the way you look for a name you\u2019ve forgotten in a list of names that are not yours. \u201cThe boy by the bridge,\u201d the note says. \u201cHe won\u2019t come home.\u201d It is kind enough to give me the time and the place like a little prayer. Rook is not the only man who enjoys a courtesy.\n\nI go because I am made of going. The bridge is the one the university built to make two sides of a promise be true at once. A boy stands on it, fourteen, perhaps, with hair he cut himself and the kind of shoulders that make me think of men who hate their own fathers. He looks at me as if he recognizes me and does not like that fact. He has a stone in his hand. He is considering where to put the stone when it stops being a stone.\n\n\u201cHello,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare tell me what to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d I say, and this is the most honest thing I\u2019ve said today.\n\n\u201cThey say you do magic,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say you make lines on the ground and lie to people about what they\u2019re standing on.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say a lot,\u201d I say. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI say there\u2019s a man who told me I could put the stone in the right place and it would make everything fair.\u201d His mouth moves around fair like a cat around a bowl of milk it does not own. \u201cI say I\u2019d like to try.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met him,\u201d I say. \u201cHe was wearing a coat that was trying to swallow him. He doesn\u2019t like us to use his first name.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said to call him Mr. Rook,\u201d the boy says, which confirms more than anything else. \u201cHe said I could give the river a mouth full of teeth. He said I could shut it and open it and shut it again. And then my mum would stop making me be two different boys for two different houses.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not what will happen,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you put the stone where he told you to put it the river will forget where the bridge is. It will remember another line. It will leave the swans standing in a car park. Your mother will still have two houses. You will still be two boys. You\u2019ll just be wetter.\u201d\n\nHe hesitates. \u201cYou don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do,\u201d I say, without tremor, because there is a hollow east of town that taught me the shape of a lie. \u201cYou know how I know? I had a mother like yours. I walked between houses like yours. I learned to keep my two selves in good pockets. The river won\u2019t fix that. It will just get between them and be yet another thing you have to cross.\u201d\n\nHe looks at me then like he would like to hit me, and then like he would like to apologize for wanting to, and then like he would like me to hug him, and he hates that worst of all. He throws the stone. It lands in the water. The water makes the sound of swallowing a coin. A little hiss. The bridge hums for a second and then stops, deciding against it. The boy sits down hard on the metal and cries like a cough. I sit down beside him. I do not touch him. I do not tell him it will be all right. We do not live in the kind of city where that is ever a promise we can make without apology. I say, \u201cDo you want to be the boy who put the stone in the wrong place and drowned an old man walking home from his pub. Or do you want to be the boy who told a man in a black coat to go to hell.\u201d\n\nHe sniffs. \u201cCan I be a boy who goes home and does his homework and then doesn\u2019t have to think about it ever again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can be the boy who goes home and does his homework and thinks about it some of the time,\u201d I say.\n\nHe gets up. He wipes his face with his sleeve like the child he still is. \u201cIf I see him again,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019ll spit.\u201d He doesn\u2019t mean it. He will do what he can. He will also sleep. We are all doing what we can.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I say. \u201cIf he ducks, spit again.\u201d\n\nHe laughs, unexpectedly, and then eyes me as if he\u2019s not supposed to. \u201cYou cold?\u201d he asks.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cYou look it,\u201d he says. \u201cYou look like you\u2019ve been standing outside a house for a long time waiting to be let in.\u201d\n\nHe goes before I can answer. I walk home slow, thinking of thresholds. The door opens as if I\u2019ve knocked, which I haven\u2019t. I step in and the house lets me in the way a cat lets you stroke it when it thinks you are an unusual patch of sunlight. I put the marble on the windowsill and it watches the street. I put the note I retrieved from my sleeve under a glass. I sleep.\n\nToward morning, a clock that isn\u2019t mine rings an hour that never was. In the minute before waking, my right hand is trapped in wood again, a door that thinks I am an idea. I am very light. I am very tired. A child is standing by the bed. The child is me, which is a trick of the light. He is holding a dead bird. He says, \u201cYou have to go in, Silas.\u201d The dead bird opens its beak and drops a bell the size of a nail, and it falls and it falls and it doesn\u2019t land.\n\nI wake with the taste of iron. There is salt on my mouth. Morning has made up its mind. Nan\u2019s cat is sitting on my windowsill, which is a feat, considering the distance. It blinks. It says, without speaking \u2013 things are very clear when they matter \u2013 \u201cThe north door is open where it should not be.\u201d\n\nI get up and put on my coat. The city is waiting for me to tell it something it already knows. The Cathedral is a tall story. The lines are playing scales. The river is not hungry, which is worse than when it is. I step into the street and I am aware of my weight, which is not the weight most men have. It is a borrowed thing. It is a habit of the city and of me. And it is, for the first time in a very long time, thinking about coming due.",

The cat blinks again, a slow curtain drawing and undrawing, and hops from the sill at a point in space that isn\u2019t there. I put my hand to the place where the air wills itself to be window and find the glass colder than the hour should allow. Streets below have their collars up. A milk lorry murmurs a psalm to itself that would prefer not to be overheard. When I lock my door I listen to the sound the key makes, a cheap little throat-clearing, and tell it to be brave. The house swallows. I tell myself the same.\n\nBy the time I reach the top of the hill the light has changed sides twice, testing which shoulder it fancies. Nan Pearce is on her step with a tin of ash and an expression the postman learned not to argue with in 1987. She has tea on the sill steaming into the cold as if to make fog her own. \u201cI did my nine,\u201d she says without looking up. \u201cOne for each soot-sprite and one for luck. Don\u2019t you say I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare,\u201d I say, and I don\u2019t. She watches my hands without appearing to. I notice a smudge of graphite on her thumb, as if she\u2019s been drawing maps on the back of the day and doesn\u2019t yet want to show anyone.\n\n\u201cYou going up.\u201d It isn\u2019t a question.\n\n\u201cNorth door,\u201d I say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll have a mouth on it,\u201d she says. \u201cDon\u2019t put your hand where you can\u2019t see the teeth. And if it asks your name, give it the wrong one first, just to see how fussy it\u2019s being today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhose name do you suggest.\u201d\n\nShe tips ash over the step, a grey tide in which three small black flecks hold their ground. \u201cBorrow mine,\u201d she says, and something in the way she offers it makes the bark at the base of my ribs soften. \u201cI can afford the bite.\u201d\n\nI carry her name in my cheek like a sweet and go on. The Cathedral sits like a thing that grew by minding its own business until everyone else got the hint. Up close, its stones are less grand than tired, fox-pawed by weather, greened in their hidden corners, bandaged in places by men with scaffolding and the confidence of people who believe gravity is a hobby. The north door is, as promised, ajar. Not open. Ajar in the way a mouth is when a dream forgets to close it. Cold breath. Honey light. A thin line of shadow like a string ready to be cut.\n\nI do not knock. I am not the sort of man who knocks on a door that knows my weight. I put my palm flat against the wood, which is both dry and damp, both Thursday and somebody\u2019s wedding day. It hums against my skin in three uneven pulses. I say, softly, \u201cNan Pearce,\u201d and the hum falters as if something indoors has forgotten its place in a procession. I say, just as softly, \u201cSilas March,\u201d and the hum steadies into itself, unimpressed by ceremony. The door allows me sideways, the way a polite host allows a stranger past a hallway painting without admitting it\u2019s hanging wrong.\n\nThe air inside has that cathedral trick of being both taller than it is and shallower than you\u2019d expect. Sounds fall upward and down the same channel, arriving back as if they took a shortcut through a bell and forgot their coats. Dust hangs in the sun like shy punctuation. I keep to the shadow at the left, where the stone remembers hands. Two steps and the floor finds the idea that is not quite level. Three steps and my right sleeve is heavier than my left. It takes a breath to realise the marble in my pocket has woken to itself the way a fish remembers water after the net. I take it out carefully. It is warm and looking. The fleck of gold winks like a star pretending not to have been seen.\n\n\u201cMind your manners,\u201d I tell it, as if that will do, and it clicks once against my nail, a little clock shrugging. When I hold it out, the air pulls toward it with the reluctance of a child sent to fetch coal. The blue deepens. The nave breathes in. I have the sudden, inconvenient memory of the ladder in the dry well and the particular fear of the place where the fall never completes itself. I close my fist. The marble still makes the blue behind my knuckles.\n\nI half expect a man in a black coat to lean against a pillar and begin a speech about angles, but the only person is a verger in the middle distance pretending not to see a shadow that belongs to me askew on the flagstones. Beyond him, a tourist with a tide-mark on her scarf looks up as if someone gently tugged a hair at the nape of her neck, then decides that nothing about her day requires explanation and consults her map. The building is doing that thing buildings do when they are shy of admitting they have a fever. I can feel the long lines running under the city shift their weight. The north one is the worst of it, a note on a faulty organ pipe.\n\nUnder the misericords there is a draught where no window owns up to being the culprit. My usual spot has borrowed a slant from a staircase I haven\u2019t yet found. I kneel, which is a courtesy as much as a convenience, and the wood under my knees answers with a little ache that doesn\u2019t belong to me. Splinter, lead, feather; they all have tongues if you\u2019ll listen to them longer than is comfortable. I put the marble in the shadow of the bench, because shadows can be counted on to mind precious things when light gets distracted. I empty my pockets in the way of a man who knows what his pockets are for: a length of green thread, a cheap brass key with no door, a folded prayer that isn\u2019t in any book, a coin that wants to pay for a sin and can\u2019t find the till. Put the coin in the notch of the wood. Lay the thread in a circle where a circle would be if people hadn\u2019t made everything crooked. Hold the key in my teeth and speak a name I wasn\u2019t given but earned. It is small work dressed up as faith and I do not pretend otherwise.\n\nThe first thing that answers is a boot. Not a whole man, no voices, just the memory of a boot crossing the floor in a hurry when war rattled glass. The second is a laugh that wants to be a cough. The third is a sound like a bell trying to ring backward, which is the one that makes my mouth go dry. The backward bell wraps round the marble under the misericord and I see, as clear as any memory I didn\u2019t live, a hand I do not know dropping a blue thing into mortar where no child has reason to reach. Once you see one blue bead, your eye makes a habit of it. There are ten. No, fewer; five. Not marbles; hearts stilled and made small. Not hearts; anchors. Not anchors; the opposite. Rook has been busy, or has inherited someone\u2019s old busyness and found a new way to spend it.\n\n\u201cTouch those and see if you can still count your fingers,\u201d says a voice behind and above me, tart as apple skin. I don\u2019t jump. We do not jump in places that taught us a new application for silence. I glance up to find Inspector Hallam doing a tidy job of pretending she\u2019s a woman who has never been told she looks out of place in a church. Her hair bears witness to rain. Her coat is the sort that knows what to do in a draught. The notebook is in her hand without having been taken out of a pocket.\n\n\u201cYou open your present,\u201d I ask, meaning the boat, and she looks briefly as if I\u2019ve asked a question the room itself will report to her superior.\n\n\u201cI put it in the sink,\u201d she says. \u201cIt pinwheeled once, which made my cat disapprove, and then sat there being unhelpful. It is currently catching the light and making me remember a toy I had when I was eight and hated because it worked. You can tell me later why it made my kitchen forget its angle. Are you going to explain why the floor here has an opinion about where my feet go.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re teaching the building a new step,\u201d I say. \u201cThey\u2019ve put weights where weights don\u2019t belong and taken them away where they do. You can make a song go slant with less.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s they,\u201d she says, but it\u2019s not a question so much as a habit.\n\n\u201cWren\u2019s wrong boy,\u201d I say, which does nothing to make this a conversation we could have in a report. \u201cAnd anyone who measured for him and anyone who had a hand in an old thing they\u2019d rather not be responsible for now that the plot\u2019s decided to go on without them.\u201d\n\nShe gives the place where my pockets emptied their truths a narrow-eyed frown and adjusts her stance by a half inch as if she has been listening to the floor longer than polite society encourages. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three separate people tell us they walked through a door here and arrived in a room with no walls. One of them claims she saw her wedding day pressed into air like a flower under glass. They all swear they didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t meaning that counts,\u201d I say. \u201cMeaning's a decoration. It\u2019s the little physics of where your feet go. Rook will make doors where there shouldn\u2019t be and then insist he didn\u2019t draw them. He likes it when we call it fate.\u201d\n\n\u201cUse plain words,\u201d she says, and there is a plea in it, unadorned. \u201cPretend I\u2019m your little sister. Pretend I still believe it\u2019s my job to get things into the right box and then close the lid firmly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to dislocate the city by resetting the Cathedral\u2019s idea of down,\u201d I say, which is not as plain as I meant. \u201cWorse, he\u2019s going to do it with things you\u2019d let a child put in his mouth. Marbles and coins and the notion of ladders that go only one way.\u201d\n\nInspector Hallam takes this with the composure of a woman who once heard a man tell her he\u2019d misplaced his brother and found him in the wardrobe and sorted both of them without a raised voice. \u201cCan you stop him.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a minute,\u201d I say. \u201cIf I can find the knot he tied and put a different knot on top with a story the building prefers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe planet will step sideways and forget to bring us,\u201d I say, and I am tired of hearing my own melodrama. \u201cHelp me. Stand there. Not on the gold star; it isn\u2019t a star. Three inches to your left. No, left. No, the other honest left.\u201d\n\nShe moves without complaining. The hem of her coat touches the shadow of a pew and the shadow warms. She feels it and doesn\u2019t start. I place the brass key under the bench where the marble lies and lay the thread across the stone so that people with hearts of poetry would call it a line and people with engineering degrees would call it interference and both would be right. The coin under the notch shifts all on its own, fed up of being good, and I press my thumb on its face until the cold and the metal and the long idea of payment have a little argument. When I lift my thumb, the coin stays where a sensible thing would fall and the backward bell in the air breathes out a fraction.\n\nNan Pearce taught me this much when I was the kind of boy who came to her door because he\u2019d made a circle with salt and couldn\u2019t get out of it without stepping on his own lie. To make a building forgive itself, you put something small where the wrong large thing is and ask the small thing to be brave. Buildings are large-hearted; they will protect what is tender if you give them half a reason. I do this five times where the blue glints in the mortar. The fifth is the kind that bites, a slick little tug in the teeth, and Inspector Hallam steadies the bench with her palm without breaking the line of her spine.\n\n\u201cIs that it,\u201d she asks, and I envy her neatness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a grace,\u201d I say. \u201cIt will hold the hour. After that, someone stubborn will come and pick them out like a grandmother with a seam-ripper who disapproves of a new dress.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that someone is Mr. Rook,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cOr a boy he tells is performing a civic duty at midnight,\u201d I say. \u201cHe\u2019s fond of giving men tasks that make them feel useful, and then telling them the job required knives only after they\u2019ve cut themselves.\u201d\n\nShe watches me for a moment without writing down a word. \u201cThe bells haven\u2019t rung on the hour for two days,\u201d she says. \u201cWe told the papers there\u2019s maintenance. Is there?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a manner of speaking,\u201d I say. \u201cThe building is telling the city something about breath. We\u2019re used to count in tens. She wants to count in threes and lags.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause the three is broken,\u201d I say, and the cynic in me is too tired to sneer at the man who talks like a book. \u201cBecause the long line under the north gate has been unbound from its keeper. Because there is a stone in the east fields that will not lie still. Because a woman with a pocket full of pebbles woke up in salt and the rope she was holding had no hook.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t ask me how I know. I think she has learned the way of it already: that some answers aren\u2019t ours but belong to places, and the places intend to keep them. \u201cIf I need you,\u201d she says, \u201cand I will, what do I do to make the telephone call you back when you ignore it.\u201d\n\n\u201cStand where you can see two doors at once and say my name twice,\u201d I say, and then, because I can feel the Cathedral\u2019s ear turn, I add, \u201cSay Nan Pearce\u2019s name first.\u201d\n\nShe almost smiles. \u201cShe told me once,\u201d she says, \u201cthat the city keeps a pocket watch in its shoe and only looks at it when a bus is late. Do you know what that means.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means there are clocks and then there are clocks,\u201d I say.\n\nWe leave on the south side because the north door thinks too hard about trapping my hand and that is a conversation for an hour when I can afford to be an idea again. Outside, the day has committed to cloud. People do the small, brave labour of pretending they are not hearing a slow steadiness where they expect chimes. Inspector Hallam walks away as if she is going to make a phone call and instead will stand in a stairwell and fold up a boat she didn\u2019t mean to be careful with. I turn toward the cloisters and the little walled garden that professionals of God have taught to sit without shaking.\n\nA girl is there who doesn\u2019t know I saw her by the water last night. She is different under day, her hair less a herald, her coat more a decision, but the clove rides the air like a porch light. She doesn\u2019t look up when I sit on the stone bench opposite, which is good manners. Her fingers worry a pocket that might have salt in it. At her feet, bees consider the last of the year\u2019s ivies and decide they owe nobody anything. I watch her for the length of nine heartbeats and she does not twitch. Good instincts. Bad advice. I wait until she looks and then I give her a nod that says the trick with the copper coin is only as clever as the day allows and that there are nights when you put back the pence and go to bed without tea.\n\n\u201cYou said sheep,\u201d she says in the voice people use when they are tall enough not to be told anything anymore.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d I say. \u201cDreams are poor drivers. They miss their turns. Did you sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cI watched my walls,\u201d she says, as if that is an apology. \u201cAnd then I got up before my mother would write me a text that makes a noise but means nothing. Are there more of them. The marbles.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are more of everything than anyone has a right to keep,\u201d I say. \u201cStay away from bridges for a while. Rook is fond of them at the minute. They\u2019re the right shape for the trick he\u2019s playing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d she says, and I appreciate the fairness of it. \u201cStaying away.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the wrong kind of shape for staying away. Go to Nan Pearce if the tea tastes of pennies. She\u2019ll pretend to scold you and give you a biscuit.\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me a rule,\u201d she says, \u201cthat isn\u2019t a superstition pretending it has a degree.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf someone offers you a way to make two halves even, ask who draws the line,\u201d I say. \u201cIf he says \u2018the world does,\u2019 spit in his eye.\u201d\n\nShe almost, almost smiles, the way a window almost fogs under a good breath in winter. \u201cI liked the way the river looked when it was wrong,\u201d she says, and the honesty of it knocks a soft place loose in me I didn\u2019t mean to show anyone. \u201cLike you could see the bottom for once. It made a noise like attention.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t looking at you,\u201d I say. \u201cIt was staring at a hole in itself. That\u2019s when people fall in with their eyes open.\u201d\n\nShe nods as if I have told her something she will put in her pocket and take out to polish when she is lonely. When I leave, I can feel her looking at my back in a way that is not possession and not plea but the lighter cousin of both.\n\nThe plan, such as I have ever been the sort of man who makes one, is to go to the east fields and sit on the stone that does not lie still until it chooses to speak in a voice older than my mistrust. The city has other ideas. Down Steep Hill I am taken in tow by a procession of schoolchildren in visible earmuffs and invisible armies of questions. They are shepherded by a teacher who has the energy of two cups of tea and the patience of someone who has learned to ignore her watch when a small boy finds a beetle. As they pass the old Roman gate two of them count in languages I cannot name and the third stumbles at nine as if nine is a step missing on a staircase. I catch his shoulder because the day is made of courtesies and he doesn\u2019t notice my hand; he notices the air where it isn\u2019t hot.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d says a voice that is a stone thrown without violence, and because I have been expecting a stone all morning my arm is already up to catch it. Evie stands with her apron twisted in both fists, looking like a person who has done a kind thing and would now like to call a friend and ask to be told she did a kind thing. \u201cThere\u2019s a man came into the shop with a bell in his pocket,\u201d she says without preamble. \u201cNot a bell you could ring. The kind that bites noises. He put it on the counter and asked if I would call a number that doesn\u2019t ring. I didn\u2019t call it. I put the bell under the till and the milk soured in my cup. I want you to tell me whether to throw it in the bin or call your inspector and say there\u2019s a crime but I can\u2019t spell it.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake me,\u201d I say, and she turns without looking to see if I\u2019ve followed, her feet sure even when the pavement forgets its responsibilities and trips three old men at once. The shop smells of cinnamon and a little burnt coffee and the inside of an afternoon. On the chalkboard someone has written a heart with the word \u201clunch\u201d in it and underlined both as if a romance can be scheduled into existence. The bell under the till is a hard little thing the colour of a bruise older than a week. When I put my finger near it, the air withdraws, offended. When I say \u201cSilas March\u201d under my breath, the bell sniffs and pretends not to hear. When I say \u201cNan Pearce\u201d it clicks. I do not attempt to be offended on my own behalf.\n\n\u201cWhose is it,\u201d Evie asks, with the courage that is doing business as cheek.\n\n\u201cMr. Rook\u2019s,\u201d I say. \u201cOr someone who thought they could borrow Mr. Rook\u2019s and return it before he counted.\u201d I pick it up by the lip and it is colder than the milk. The counter darkens where it leaves, not with stain but with the sort of shadow that happens when an idea sits down. \u201cThis is for stopping the ring,\u201d I say. \u201cHe seeded the Cathedral with anchors; he seeded the city with mutes. When you take the lid off the pot, the steam goes somewhere else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it do to people,\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cMakes the wrong noises louder,\u201d I say. \u201cMakes the right ones come up for air at the wrong time. Makes children say it\u2019s Monday when it\u2019s only ever been Thursday here.\u201d\n\nShe watches my hands as if they are a solution to a problem that has had the rudeness not to present itself neatly. \u201cDo I throw it away,\u201d she asks, and her voice is brittle in the places of it that care about receipt books and tills that balance and a life that could be all right if left alone.\n\n\u201cIf you throw it away it will make the dust fall wrong and a man with a van will forget how to reverse,\u201d I say. \u201cIf I take it it will make my pocket heavier. If we keep it here under metal it will sulk and do its worst trick slowly.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the worst trick,\u201d she says, with admirable professionalism.\n\n\u201cIt stops a bell you cannot hear,\u201d I say. \u201cThe one that tells you when to run and when to stay. The one you used last night when you stood up and decided not to count the swans. Keep it very still. Put sugar on it and tell your till a joke. If it laughs you\u2019ve won an hour.\u201d\n\nEvie sighs in that full-bodied way people do when they decide to be kind to themselves despite the day\u2019s mood. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you\u2019re handsome,\u201d she says, without malice. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t, all of this would sound like a very long excuse. Go. Before I ask you to untie the knot in the corner there and you tell me it\u2019s a helpful ghost.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll look at the knot on my way out or not,\u201d I say, and her grin is a thing I don\u2019t deserve and will live on longer than it should.\n\nOn the square, a wind has fetched up from the east with the particular dirt of that direction in it. It smells of hedges and the tin pan clatter of rain that hasn\u2019t committed yet. I take the east road and feel the city peel away in strips like bark, the new houses sore around the edges where the old plan resents them. Fields gather out of habit. At the ditch the blackthorn puts its spines up, which is what blackthorn does best. The hollow where the stone lies looks innocent as a nap. I sit with my feet in grass that cannot decide whose side it\u2019s on and listen to the ground fail to hide the beat moving under it.\n\n\u201cShow me where you came loose,\u201d I say, and am about to feel a fool when a rook \u2013 an actual bird, the sort that will teach you economy of wing if you let it \u2013 drops something from its beak at the edge of the circle. Not a twig. A small loop of wire, the kind used to tie up roses and sometimes used to tie up worse. I pick it up and it is warm although nothing that ought to heat it has touched it. There is a hair caught in it. Thin. Grey. Long enough to have belonged to a woman who had learned to plait with patience. The stone under my hand thinks about my palm. The earth opens its mouth a fraction and breathes a syllable like a door with bad manners.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be here alone,\u201d Nan says, except she isn\u2019t present and doesn\u2019t need to be to say it. Her voice comes down the hedge like a warning tied with ribbon. \u201cIf he\u2019s been stepping on my floorboards without telling me, he\u2019s been stepping on yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe leaves courtesies where they cost him more than they cost me,\u201d I say, aloud or into the ground; it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cHe left me a boy at a bridge. He left Evie a bell. He left the Cathedral anchors and mutes. This wire is for planting in the wrong place and calling it gardening.\u201d\n\nThe wind turns cold in the middle, which is a talent I wish it had less often. On it I hear the three-beat ring lagging like a drunk who wants you to think he\u2019s sober. I put the loop flat on the stone and say the name I do not say to most men, the one that fits in my throat like a piece of cherry pit. The loop twitches, a little worm remembering earth. I drop salt around it in a circle so small it feels mean. The wire is the size of a god if you\u2019re an ant. My hands aren\u2019t shaking. That arrives later, when there\u2019s nothing left to do and the only thing to be is cold.\n\nRook is with me without being with me. The air takes on that pricked-at-back-of-neck care you only get when you realise the sky is listening. I could turn and find him leaning on a stile making a case for difficult kindness and the civilising properties of calamity. Instead I look at the blackthorn and the blackthorn looks back like an old woman with something to say about your shoes. I spit, once, the old way, the way that makes the salt take notice, and push the wire into the stone where stone pretends not to have seams. The moment it goes the earth lurches, not much, only enough to make my teeth want to say unpleasant words. The three-beat stumbles and then, for a breath, runs true. The hollow remembers water and changes its mind. Somewhere back toward the river a swan adjusts its feathers with an opinion.\n\nThe price is never what you think. I stand up and the weight I carry doesn\u2019t come with me. I can feel it behind, sitting down and refusing to budge like a cat you paid good money for and who has never once done anything on command. For a mean little second I am light in a way that needs a ladder down a well and a very long rope. I say my name, the long one, with all the syllables it has no business being allowed, and I can tell the sound has to go a longer way to find me than it should. When the weight arrives it drops into me with a thump that makes me say a word that would disappoint a vicar and a child who collects special adjectives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all right,\u201d I tell the hedges, because that is the sort of lie that soothed a frightened mother and might yet soothe something else. The hedges are unimpressed. They know I will pay for the wire with a day shorter than it should be and hands colder than meat left on a doorstep in January. I would like a bun. I would like a table in a kitchen that understands me. I have neither. I have the long walk back into a city that will, if I ask properly, pretend it cannot smell what I\u2019ve been getting on my shoes.\n\nOn the way I meet a boy flying a kite without wind. He runs until his breath bursts and the kite lifts out of politeness. When it is high enough it remembers whose business it is and tugs a path invisible as a good lie. At the top of his run he looks at me in the way boys do who are measuring whether a man would resent being called uncle, and I nod. You must be generous with permissions. It gives the day an inch.\n\nThe Cathedral is quieter when I pass it again. Not quiet, which is an insult. Quieter, which is a truce. The bells still will not ring for the hour. They will ring for something else if asked properly by a hand that has earned the rope. The north door is shut, decent, the sort of closed that makes you feel a fool for trying the handle. I do not. I go to Nan instead and find her in the kitchen warming her hands at a stove that only admits to being fire when you tell it it is a chair. The cat watches me the way cats count to two.\n\n\u201cYou put it back,\u201d she says. She pours tea that will never be hot enough. \u201cFor an hour you\u2019ve bought us the price of seeing what comes next. Don\u2019t thank yourself. That kind of thank you trips the next man and he isn\u2019t ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvie\u2019s got a bell in a till,\u201d I say. \u201cIt is sulking under sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can keep it until half past,\u201d Nan says. \u201cThen she wraps it in wax paper and takes it to the river and tells it to teach fish to listen to snow. It won\u2019t, but the refusal will take it all night.\u201d\n\n\u201cRook will be angry,\u201d I say, a minor truth spoken to fill a space.\n\n\u201cRook is always angry,\u201d she says. \u201cThe man was built of wards that all failed, so he made his own and pretended they were other people\u2019s. He\u2019s been knocking on doors that do not belong to him since his feet had the grace of new boots. He has his uses. He reminds the city it is loved enough to be fought for.\u201d She looks at my hands and makes a sound like disapproval wrapped round pity. \u201cYou\u2019ll not go cold and call it a mood. You\u2019ll eat something while I read something I did not want to keep and kept. The Wren\u2019s boy left me a page once. He thought me stupid enough to burn it. I put it between two good cookbooks and told it I\u2019d use it when I ran out of biscuits.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it,\u201d I ask.\n\n\u201cThe order of who gets to carry the rope and for how long before their wrists give out,\u201d she says, and carries a jar to the table with the solemnity some women keep for wreaths.\n\nWe do not read it. Not yet. The kettle decides to be kind for once and the tea is only half cruel. On the sill the cat arranges its face into a map of a district no one believes in. The city pats its pockets for its pocket watch and checks it only to be certain the bus won\u2019t come when anyone expects. In the floor, close under our feet, there is a beat that is not the hour. It misses once and then, with a small human stubbornness I will never get tired of admiring, finds itself. The day makes a sound like something heavy put down gently on purpose.\n\nWhen the telephone rings it rings in a part of the house where there never was a telephone. Nan gets up as if the chair might follow her and makes the cords behave with a look women learn in rooms where men say the word committee too often. She holds out the receiver as if it is a bird she has taught to sit without pecking. \u201cFor you,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s the inspector. She sounds like a woman who opened a paper boat and found a river where a list should be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened,\u201d I ask when the wires remember my ear.\n\n\u201cThe clock in the Stonebow tried to strike thirteen,\u201d Inspector Hallam says, crisp as a new apron. \u201cIt got as far as eleven and then remembered it was a stone. Half the high street walked like men on a ship. I have one elderly gentleman who says he shook a hand under an arch and it shook back and kept his hand. Tell me where to stand.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the arch where the pigeon refuses to shit,\u201d I say, which is more instruction than most days grant. \u201cFace the cathedral. Put your left hand on the stone and your right on your own belt. Don\u2019t let go of the belt. Say the word noon as if you mean it and if anyone laughs at you tell them to bring you a chair and a sandwich.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you,\u201d she says, only that, and the way she means it has the weight of a woman who has learned to delegate to men without letting them get ideas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m coming,\u201d I say. \u201cDon\u2019t tell it your name until I get there. If it asks, tell it you\u2019re Nan Pearce and that you\u2019ll wait.\u201d\n\nWe hang up as if we were always meant to, in the middle of something, like a book dropped to answer a knock. Nan pours jam into a saucer and writes a letter in it with a knife. The letter is the shape letters make when they have been doing something else for a very long time and resent being summoned. I don\u2019t ask who it is to. I put on my coat because it is cold and because coats are the last promise you make before leaving a room where you were real. When I step into the street the city pretends to be ordinary for my sake and fails at it. The Cathedral watches without blinking. The long line under the north door hums like someone with the tune and none of the words. The world is thinking about the cost of tilt and finding small change under the sofa. I run, if the movement I manage can be called that, down a hill that remembers my feet and is not yet done adding them up.",

                              "content": "The Stonebow has the posture of an old soldier who knows where his scars are and won\u2019t be told otherwise. Between his legs the street does its little dance of vans and pushchairs and men whose legs remember mines. The clock sits in its housing like a single bright eye that would prefer to be shut. Under the arch Inspector Hallam stands exactly where I told her to, which is the first kindness of the day and a surprising one. Her left hand is on the stone; her right fists her own belt with that particular authority only women who\u2019ve learned to hold a room with a throat clear possess. A small crowd has the decency to pretend they are not a crowd. They become pedestrians with urgent destinations at the sight of a woman who might be about to write their names down.\n\n\u201cYou took your time,\u201d she says without the sting of reproach, and I am grateful to her for it. Her mouth is set where her patience keeps its teeth.\n\n\u201cTime takes me,\u201d I say, and she exhales in a way that says she will allow me one sentence like that per morning. \u201cSay noon again. Mean it as if you\u2019re telling a lie you want to become true.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoon,\u201d she says, and the arch passes the word up through its body like a fish passed hand to hand along a line of children who have discovered a stream where there didn\u2019t used to be one. The clock quivers. It wants very much to be thirteen and knows that is an impoliteness. It tries for twelve and cannot find the shore.\n\nThere is a man to the side with his hand pressed against nothing. His wrist is cocked awkward, fingers splayed as if showing us all he\u2019s harmless. He turns slow when I look at him and his eyes are that surprised blue some men keep like a spare shirt. \u201cIt kept me,\u201d he says in a voice that wants to apologize for the weather. \u201cI gave my hand to a gentleman whose face I can\u2019t see. He kept it. I am still wearing it.\u201d He waves the air where his skin pretends to be. The air makes the sound of old leather refusing.\n\n\u201cWho did you shake,\u201d I ask, not unkind, and his mouth folds around the answer as if it is rude.\n\n\u201cThe city,\u201d he says finally. \u201cShe had a man\u2019s hand on, just then. It seemed wrong to refuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever refuse a city who offers her hand,\u201d I say. \u201cBut make sure she gives it back when the hour has finished.\u201d I put my fingers to the stone where his shadow drags and my hand tingles in that particular way that says you\u2019re about to find out whether you\u2019re paying or being paid. The Stonebow is a gate with long memories of terms and conditions. He likes to keep a token, a cuff, a skin-echo, because that\u2019s what gates do when they\u2019re asked to behave like men.\n\n\u201cI brought a better thing to hold,\u201d I tell him, and take the glove from my pocket I carry for borrowings. It is no more than cheap suede and a superstition, but it has been used as a hand more often than some men\u2019s hands, and the Stonebow appreciates experience. I slide the glove into the air where the man\u2019s fingers can\u2019t exit and the arch takes it with the offended dignity of an aunt given the wrong gift at Christmas. The man\u2019s hand comes away, reluctant as a dog from a butcher\u2019s door, and he makes a sound people only make when a body part remembers what it is for. His eyes dampen without permission and he closes them, because that is how men of his age say thank you.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t shake anything for a week,\u201d I tell him, and he nods as if I\u2019ve sentenced him to kindness. \u201cIf a stranger offers you his hand, offer him your shoulder. If he insists, cough in his face.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat I can do,\u201d he says, and the smile on the corner of his mouth proves there is a reason I like this city even when it is trying to walk on its side.\n\nInspector Hallam hasn\u2019t moved. She is all attention to the stone and to the belt and to an invisible place halfway between both. Up above us, the clock limbers. A pigeon sits on the one patch of the arch nobody fouls and regards me with the disapproval reserved for men who\u2019ve put their coats on backwards. The jam-letter Nan wrote hums under my cuff, sugar drying into a map of an instruction neither of us read. I lick my thumb and press it to the fabric. The shape lifts, slick and obedient, the way sugar does when it is asked in the old sentences, and I put my thumb to the arch just where the inspector\u2019s hand does not reach.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to smear a sandwich on a monument,\u201d Hallam says, clinging to irony because it is cheaper than hope.\n\n\u201cJam is a contract,\u201d I say. \u201cAsk any grandmother.\u201d I do not say that sugar is older than bells and fractions and sometimes older than men. The stone takes the sweet, sucks it up in a slow, greedy inhalation, and the air relaxes a notch like a muscle unclenched. For a moment the bricks remember market days, noon marked by a bell and a hungry man counting his coppers before choosing which pie to buy. The clock, soothed by a memory that didn\u2019t belong to it five seconds ago and now absolutely does, looks at its one hand in the way clocks do and decides to be reasonable.\n\n\u201cTwelve,\u201d Inspector Hallam says, an inch above a whisper, as if saying it too loud would make someone come along and put a tax on it. The clock obeys like a horse that was always going to, and then makes a big show of having thought of it first. A single deep note goes out into the street and people startle in that small communal way that proves we are an animal. The second note follows, a hair tired, but sure enough that pigeons rethink their previous engagements. By the time we are at six, a bus driver wipes his eye and blames the wind. At nine, the boy with the apple yesterday I thought would go bad grows up a year and doesn\u2019t know why his pocket feels lighter. At twelve the inspector relaxes her belt hand as if only then has she discovered she\u2019s been holding herself from falling.\n\n\u201cIt wanted thirteen,\u201d she says, bleakly delighted. \u201cWhat sort of city grieves for a number.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sort that was promised a thirteen and told to behave,\u201d I say. \u201cWe put our dirty numbers in the attic. He\u2019s bringing them down and making them sit at the table.\u201d I could say his name and invite him into the conversation, but there are days you choose to leave a place between you and the story you\u2019re not ready to say aloud.\n\nAround us, Lincoln performs normality like a piece of music it plays very well. The small crowd remembers it has separate errands. A young woman puts her ear to her phone as if listening will make the words appear. The man with the returned hand flexes a lot in ways no one will make fun of because there are ages at which happiness is permitted to be obvious. Inspector Hallam releases her belt and you can see in the line of her shoulders how much of her day is the labor of not letting the world know what she\u2019s lifting.\n\n\u201cWhat did the jam say,\u201d she asks, adjusting her cuffs as if they are responsible for her composure.\n\n\u201cThat you could expect a letter without a stamp,\u201d I say, because Nan\u2019s sugar handwriting speaks in courtesy phrases no postman respects. \u201cDon\u2019t open it unless the floor of the room is wearing shoes. If the letter hums, hum back. If it hums louder, put it under water.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you and she share a subscription to a poet,\u201d she asks, no heat in it. \u201cWhen I go back to the station, what do I tell men who like nouns that sit still.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaintenance,\u201d I say, and that word has become today\u2019s coat for a hundred things no one signed up for. \u201cTell them a pin came loose in the clock and you tightened it and if they don\u2019t believe you send them to me and I will charge them double for the look on their faces.\u201d\n\nShe does smile, properly this time, and then it goes away because there are particulars. \u201cHe was here,\u201d she says, not looking left or right.\n\n\u201cHe is always two streets away,\u201d I say. \u201cHe has a way of standing in a place you can count and reaching through to the one you cannot. He will have been under here. Or he will have told a kind man to stand under here at the right hour and shake hands with the arch and call it a civic duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am getting tired of other people\u2019s kindness being used as a weapon,\u201d she says evenly. \u201cIf you see me arrest a courtesy, look away.\u201d\n\nA gull goes by with authority under its wing. The clock decides the morning can have another kernel of obedience and settles. I press my hand to the stone one more time and the stone has the decency to remember my weight. It gives me a small push like a big brother with children to save. The glove remains in the air where a hand is not, which is a debt I will have to talk to later. The man whose hand came free puts down a tenner on a bench because you pay something when you get away with a thing in this city, and a teenage boy with the good sense to leave it alone leaves it alone.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take your eyes off bridges,\u201d I tell Hallam, and we both know I mean more than concrete and river. \u201cIf you find ropes where ropes oughtn\u2019t to be, don\u2019t put a hand on them. Call me or Nan. If you can\u2019t call either, sing and then count your teeth.\u201d\n\nShe nods as a woman learns to nod when the world stops advertising its sane parts. \u201cGo,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore I give in to the warm impulse to take you to a station and make you fill in a form until you die and I can plant you under a rhododendron. My men are going to arrive in two minutes with measuring tapes and decide everything is seasonal.\u201d\n\nI go, because she told me to and because there is a sound in the ground like a string discovered to be cut and trying to decide whether to pretend otherwise. The glove under the arch twitches, offended to be abandoned; I return, make a shape with my mouth that promises later, and the arch, smug, settles its own dust. Even city monuments will keep your glove if you let them, and everyone knows an arch in a mood can hold a pocket for years.\n\nHigh Street is full of the reasonable lies we tell one another to keep the hours from keeling over. A woman in a red coat is offering her dog a biscuit as if asking him to sign for it. The brass band that isn\u2019t there warms a trumpet in the air. I meet Evie halfway to nowhere good and she steers me to the kerb by main force of aproned determination.\n\n\u201cThe bell sulked,\u201d she reports, breathless in that competent way that makes you forgive her everything. \u201cThe till laughed at a joke which is worrying given I didn\u2019t tell one, and then a man bought a sandwich with a coin that had a bishop on the wrong side. When he left the door didn\u2019t catch him, which offended the door, and I told the door it could have a biscuit later. Tell me I\u2019m not babysitting objects.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re running a creche,\u201d I say. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying not to teach them the wrong swear words. Keep the bell under sugar. If a man with chalk on his cuffs comes in and asks to buy it, sell him a scone and tell him he\u2019s allergic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI could put it on a shelf next to the keep cup that tells lies,\u201d she says, and her eyes are tired and kind, which is the worst of it. \u201cYou look better for having run. Or worse. Either way you look like a verb. Nan sent word you did a thing with a wire out east. Do not tell me it cost you nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt cost me the easy hour,\u201d I say. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever liked that hour much anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou liar,\u201d she says gently, and shoves a wrapped bun into my pocket without asking permission because she is a woman who understands where pockets sit in the grand scheme. \u201cIf you see the inspector tell her I will testify that the milk went wrong at ten past and righted itself at half past. She can put it in a chart and frown.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will instruct her to frown only at even numbers,\u201d I say, and Evie rolls her eyes at being courted by the kind of language that avoids its own club.\n\nPast the Stonebow the city opens its throat to traffic like a choir. Down by the river the swans resume their practicing for sainthood. I mean to keep off the water as if it is a man I promised not to call, but my feet remember which way the fields are and I take the long route that lets me pass the Roman bit and the so-called haunted shop that is haunted the way a dog is haunted by the idea of being a cat. On the corner there is a letterbox with a mouth like a frog; a paper pushes itself against the slot without a stamp and I put my hand out because of course it is for me.\n\nThe envelope is the sort of white that gets its way. There is no address on it, only the impression of having known where it was going longer than I\u2019ve been alive. When I tilt it, the light decides whether to be friend or witness and comes down on witness. I do not open it in the street because I know better than to let a day see itself become a bad habit. I slip it under my coat where letters don\u2019t behave and walk until my hands stop pretending they belong to weather.\n\nNan\u2019s kitchen receives the envelope with the same air it receives all awkward relatives, which is to say it makes it sit on the chair with the wobble and watch the sugar. The cat is elsewhere making a case for being necessary. Nan knives butter as if the butter is a man who has written letters and taken their replies and she will not be impressed by either. I lay the envelope on the table and neither of us admits to having held our breath.\n\n\u201cIt hums,\u201d she observes after a minute has had the courtesy to pass. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019s pleased with itself. The humming ones that are proud are a different trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can drown it,\u201d I say, and she snorts because that is the kind of foolishness we permit ourselves while the kettle finds its voice.\n\n\u201cYou can read it like a man reads a map while walking,\u201d she says. \u201cOpen it and keep one finger in your own name. If it tries to pull, bite it. If it sings to you, match it on the low end. We\u2019re not here to make a duet.\u201d She pushes a saucer of water toward me with the gravity of a woman giving communion and nods at the envelope as if to say she\u2019s done her work and the next clumsy bit is mine.\n\nThe paper peels back like skin. Inside there is a single thin page, the colour of a bruise, which is a deliberate choice I don\u2019t feel like praising. Ink has to be coaxed out of it; the words don\u2019t sit politely, they come toward you as if they have opinions on your weight. I keep my little finger tucked under the long bar of the H in my name and make my mouth say a poem I learned by accident when I was fourteen and trying not to count the same field twice. It is a good poem for letters sent by men who don\u2019t buy stamps.\n\n\u201cMr. March,\u201d the letter says in a voice I hear regardless of my eyes, and it is the sort of voice men pay to have teach them elocution and the sort of voice that has never once apologized for the shape of a table. \u201cWe are taking the pains to correspond because it saves everyone the ugliness of performance. Imagine me in my coat, if it pleases, and if it does not, imagine me without it, if that pleases more. I have seen your work with the anchors and the mutes and I commend you the neatness of your patch. It will fail, of course, but we must be grateful to the small graces as they burn.\u201d\n\nThere is a taste of chalk at the back of my tongue, exactly as if I have licked a blackboard to prove a point and found it disagreed. The letters rearrange themselves as I refuse to admire them.\n\nHe continues with that soft poison he prefers. \u201cIt is unkind of me not to ask after your cold, but you seem to carry it like a pet and I would not insult a man\u2019s beloved. I write today to tell you that your Cathedral has learned a new word and the word is apart. You will go to her, because it is what you do, and you will be turned sideways and made to stand in a long room with no walls where the idea of falling has been rehearsed with some care. If you wish to avoid the discomfort, avoid the north door. Go west for a spell. Speak to no one who stands with two shadows. Tell Nan Pearce to bring her jam and her ten names. I am being generous in my warnings. We will have an hour, perhaps two, of sport before the weight returns to you. Please be dressed.\u201d\n\nNan laughs in spite of herself and in spite of me and in spite of Rook, because he has accidentally been funny which is the most human sin he commits. The laughter lands on the table like bread. The water in the saucer ripples as if something under it moved a tail. The letter hums, smug, and I push it into the saucer in a gesture I would like to pretend is casual and is not. Ink curls up like hair. The page pushes against the water like a moth against a window and then relaxes with a sigh that does not belong to paper.\n\n\u201cHe does love to be admired,\u201d Nan says, wiping her knife, which is cleaner than it has any right to be. \u201cHe imagines he is taking something from you when he writes your name nicely. He wants the Cathedral to tell you apart from yourself. It will try, and you will stand it for a minute because you like to see your bones in mirrors as much as any man does.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will go west,\u201d I say, as if that is the plan when we both know the plan is to go where the teeth are and put my hand where I\u2019ve been told not to.\n\n\u201cYou will go how you were made,\u201d she says, buttering bread with a firmness that brooks no argument. \u201cEat, because you\u2019re going to have to do an old thing in a new way and that takes a stomach. Take my name in your cheek and your father\u2019s in your fist and the boy\u2019s from the bridge in your pocket and if the building calls you a liar tell it to get in line. If Rook puts his hand out to shake, you spit. Not because it will save you, but because your grandmother is watching and she\u2019d be cross if you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich grandmother,\u201d I ask, because it is the sort of luxury we allow each other when the hour is doing maths without us.\n\n\u201cThe one with the dead bird,\u201d she says, and we leave it at that because there are rooms in a house that open only if you pretend they\u2019re not there.\n\nI take her name and fold it under my tongue where it stings in the way of hard sweets you\u2019re not supposed to crunch. I put the boy\u2019s coin in my left pocket so that if I have to throw it I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t mean to. I go west because I said I would and because sometimes I have to teach myself I can do as I\u2019ve been told in order to have any authority when I refuse.\n\nThe west of the Cathedral is the part that thinks about weather and graves and the slow progress of mushrooms. The door there has a humility the north one cannot be bothered with. It sits low in the wall as if admitting to being made by hands and opened by them and closed by them and not by some fancy arrangement of levers that looks like a prayer. I press my palm to it and for a long breath the wood is indifferent to me. This is a relief. If indifference would save the world I would be its greatest champion.\n\n\u201cNan Pearce,\u201d I say, and the wood takes a polite interest. \u201cSilas March,\u201d I say, and it tests my name in its grain and doesn\u2019t spit. The latch lifts itself as if it is making up its mind whether to entertain. Inside, the smell is less honey and more wax. The light is late afternoon even though it is not. Things in the west of a building like this are always a little behind and a little ahead. The floor here remembers kneelers more than footsteps and my knees itch with the memory of other men\u2019s prayers. I stand very straight out of respect for those who deformed themselves by faith.\n\nA woman sits two pews in and two to the left, because that is where women sit who have more to say than they will. Her hair is the colour of the wire loop and her hands are careful the way hands get careful when they have carried the rope too long. She does not look at me and I do not look at her because this is one of those times when looking is a question neither of us is ready to translate. The place she is sitting is where a keeper would sit if a keeper were tired and wanted to pretend to be a parishioner before going back to her post.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d she says finally, and there is the smile in it of someone who has been waiting longer than years admit.\n\n\u201cThe clock argued,\u201d I say. \u201cIf you\u2019re the woman I think you are, I brought you nothing you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a pocketful once,\u201d she says, and her voice is the sound a rope makes in hands. \u201cOf stones that thought they were good for drowning and then learned the wrong lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you go to the sea,\u201d I ask, because I am not kind enough to avoid the questions that unhook men\u2019s jaws, and she is not as fragile as men told us she was.\n\n\u201cBecause the hill here is not a cliff,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause some things have to be done where the world remembers to become a line. Because he put his foot on my floor and said please in a voice like a boy who had been told very often that he could not be stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you mean to unbind him,\u201d I ask, and even as I say it I taste the idiocy of the grammar of blame.\n\n\u201cI meant to hold him until someone else took the other end,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd no one did. I am so very tired of being the only knot. I went to the water because I thought the sea would be the kind of mother my city wasn\u2019t being to me. She was kinder than people say and less interested than I needed. When I walked back I was a letter with no stamp and men didn\u2019t stop throwing me through doors until one of them stuck.\u201d\n\nRook loves a wound he didn\u2019t cause. He puts his mouth to the edge of it and tells everyone how tasty blood is and you\u2019re grateful to him for naming it. I can feel him somewhere in the organ loft waiting for me to choose a note he has saved specially. He has brought us to the nave twice in two days and that means he is impatient or bored or bored with being patient. I drop the paper boat Evie gave me on the flagstones because sometimes you have to make an object remember its nature in public to give the room an example. The boat shivers, which is ridiculous because boats don\u2019t shiver in draughts, and then slides very slowly toward the tomb of a bishop who owed too much money and learned to be liked anyway.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made a room with no walls,\u201d the woman says, and now she looks at me because there is no longer any point in pretending she might be talking to herself. \u201cWhere boys practicing being men can go and think they are hero enough to change the air. He has told them the measurements of the door that isn\u2019t there and then said it\u2019s a test to see who deserves the name of man. When a boy fails he is so grateful to call himself a coward he goes home and works twice as hard at hurting the next person who asks him to try.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is the door,\u201d I ask, which is the wrong question but the only one I have room for with all this grief pressing urgent at my ribs.\n\n\u201cWhere the choir stalls used to be before a man decided there was no music in them,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere the stone remembers being water. Where your hands go when you think about falling.\u201d\n\nI set my hands exactly where she says and it is there, the feeling of a threshold the height of a man\u2019s habit. It runs under my palms like a cat deciding whether it knows me. The backward bell is louder here, not in my ears but in my teeth. If I step, I will step into the long room with no walls and the sense of falling that is not the thing itself but the rehearsal of it until the day the curtain rises. I think of the boy on the bridge and his desire for a line to make his two halves even. I think of Evie\u2019s bell sulking under sugar and the way the till laughed even when it wanted to refuse. I think of the arch and the glove and Jam as contract and fences as suggestions and the number thirteen as a child sent upstairs.\n\n\u201cIf I go,\u201d I say, because it is a habit of mine to narrate my own cowardice, \u201cI might not bring my weight out with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t,\u201d she says, \u201csome other boy will go and leave his weight in your place. There are no new debts. Only unsettled ones.\u201d\n\nI step because I was always going to, and because I would like, one evening in a city that does not expect miracles, to sleep before midnight. The long room isn\u2019t a room. It is an agreement between two ideas that have ceased to be on speaking terms. The floor is not floor. The ceiling is not ceiling. Sound finds a way to get lost here and then pretends it was meant. A ladder goes down without going up and when I look over my shoulder I can see my shoulder at an angle it has no business being seen. The three-beat ring taps my ribs like fingers. The space smells of chalk, of summer rain on stone, of tinder that someone won\u2019t admit is stacked against a door.\n\nRook is not here, which is worse. There is a boy, though, because there is always a boy in rooms men planned for themselves. He is older than the bridge boy and younger than the man whose hand I returned and he has a face that has been practicing not being soft. He looks at me the way boys do when their mouth wants to say father and their sense wants to say man and both fail and they say, because they have to say something, \u201cAre you supposed to be here.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, which is the most honest answer to most invitations. \u201cNeither are you. What did he tell you this room was for.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo make it fair,\u201d he says, and his lower lip does that little hold men teach it to do so they won\u2019t bite it in front of strangers.\n\n\u201cWhat does fair look like to you,\u201d I ask, and he blinks because he\u2019s never been asked to draw a picture of a word he uses to stay standing.\n\n\u201cLike nobody asks me to carry anything and then shout at me when I drop it,\u201d he says finally. \u201cLike the sky not choosing. Like the ground remembering how to be ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we\u2019re in the wrong room for that,\u201d I say. \u201cThis is the room where things that decide they\u2019re tired of their jobs come to petition for new titles. If you leave a thing in here, it will write its own name on you. That\u2019s the only fairness you\u2019ll get.\u201d\n\nHe swallows with the enthusiasm of a man learning to like bad medicine. \u201cHe said I could leave my fear here and walk out clean.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told you a story a man told him and forgot to think about what the fear eats when you\u2019re gone,\u201d I say. \u201cIt eats whoever comes in next with his mouth open.\u201d\n\nThe paper boat slides past us and we both watch it in spite of ourselves because there is something absurd and civil about a boat minding itself on stone. It turns once, entirely pleased with its decision to be a boat in a place that would rather be a corridor, and comes to rest against a line that isn\u2019t on the floor. Where it touches, for an inch, the room remembers edge. It is not much. It is enough.\n\n\u201cStand there,\u201d I tell the boy, and he stands there because even boys who have been taught to refuse authority will obey certain voices in certain rooms where the wind doesn\u2019t behave. \u201cPut your hands in your pockets and hold nothing. If the room gives you anything, refuse it. If your own body offers you falling, tell it to mind its own business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you going to do,\u201d he asks, bravado losing ground to curiosity like grass being eaten by a river that swore it would behave.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be polite,\u201d I say, and I take out the coin and the thread and the cheap brass key and the prayer that never belonged in any book and the last of Nan\u2019s name sugar that I kept under my tongue to be stubborn with. I lay the thread on the idea of floor, not crossing lines because lines are sensitive. I put the coin on the place the paper boat kissed and the coin stays, which is rude and useful. I set the key upright and tell it to imagine a door it would enjoy opening for the rest of its life. The key considers loyalty and decides to try. I spit, because some days spit is as good as Latin, and the room flinches, which is not pretty but is progress.\n\nThe long beat tries to play itself on my ribs and I refuse to be an instrument. I count in sevens because that is a number that behaves badly without being dramatic about it. The room, offended, attempts to count in threes with a lag, and we have an argument that would make a musician cry and a mathematician leave the house. Inspector Hallam would glare this room into admitting it lost the paperwork. Evie would give it a bun and charge it double. Nan would put jam on the first step and tell it not to eat in bed. I am alone with sugar and a boy and a paper boat and my hands, which have always been too cold and too full and too good for trouble.\n\n\u201cMr. Rook,\u201d I say finally, because it is not an incantation if you enjoy it, and the room perks like a dog whose name has been misused. \u201cYou built something rude in a place that prefers courtesies. You forgot to tell the building good morning. I would be grateful if you would take your cutlery back to the kitchen and wash it yourself. If you\u2019re determined to tip the table, do it where women aren\u2019t eating.\u201d\n\nHe isn\u2019t there, but he hears it, because the next breath the room takes tastes of chalk and pride and a boy\u2019s shame that has been scrubbed with someone else\u2019s hands. The three-beat stumbles on its second and then finds a different staircase. The paper boat tips and rights itself with the dignity of a thing that refuses to be mocked by physics. The coin vibrates a fraction; the key leans toward a door it prefers the smell of. I push the sugar into a line with my thumb and the room\u2019s mouth makes a noise that is the bell trying to ring backward and finding itself, to its surprise, unwilling.\n\n\u201cGo home,\u201d I tell the boy, because sometimes you are allowed to give an order without tinsel. \u201cWhen someone offers you a room like this again, ask them if they can smell their own feathers burning. If they say yes, leave. If they say no, leave faster.\u201d\n\nHe hesitates, his courage wanting a souvenir, and I give him the paper boat because it has behaved, and because I am not a man who can carry any more small brave things without putting one down. He cradles it as if it will leak if held wrong and vanishes through a door that isn\u2019t there unless you know its name. The room and I consider one another. The beat, no longer lagging, returns to where it belongs, which is not in men\u2019s teeth.\n\nWhen I step out, my weight is beside me like a twin and I have to coax it back on. The woman with the wire hair is gone, as women are when they have said their part and found the men around them unable to take remark as instruction. The west door opens to me with the diffidence of an acquaintance who has liked me for years and is embarrassed about it. Outside, the day is a colour that ought to have a name and never did.\n\nRook is halfway down the close under a yew, his coat trying less hard than usual because he wants me to see the shape of him under it. He applauds, as if the Cathedral asked him to behave, and we both have the grace to be embarrassed in front of so many dead. There is a boy at his side with a mouth that has said no today and liked the sound of it. Rook bows to me as if there were silver between us on a low table and we were both pretending not to count it.\n\n\u201cPoliteness will be the death of us,\u201d he says, almost mellow. \u201cDid you open my letter near water. It improves the bouquet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI opened it where a woman can reach it with a knife,\u201d I say, and he laughs because he cannot help praising the right lines when he hears them sung.\n\n\u201cYou tire,\u201d he says, not with triumph or pity, but with the clinical curiosity of a man who has never had a fever in a house with a broken fire. \u201cEat. Sleep. Bring your small green threads. Tomorrow we will do something more interesting. The Moor Gate remembers her name. Perhaps we will go and unfasten the idea of town and country and let them marry for an afternoon. The city is trying to balance her own books and I have a pencil she will enjoy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNan says you were built of failed wards,\u201d I say, because I long ago gave up applauding men who admire themselves for their own injuries. \u201cMake your own and stop borrowing ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re only yours because you were more stubborn on the day,\u201d he says, not denying the wound and not shamed by it. \u201cI am going to teach your Cathedral a better thirteen. When you come up to stop me, bring salt. Your salt is honest in a way I can\u2019t afford to be.\u201d\n\nHe flicks something at me with two fingers and I have, to my everlasting disgust, the quickness to catch it. It is a nail, small, bright, with a head like an eye that would prefer to be closed. It is very light in my palm and then very heavy and then reasonable, as if remembering itself. He smiles like a boy in a school photograph whose tie is not properly done. The yew behind him drops a single berry out of spite.\n\n\u201cPoliteness is a door,\u201d he says, and his mouth softens briefly on the word in a way that makes me want to kick him. \u201cI am holding it open for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go through after you,\u201d I say, and he inclines his head as if there is any chance of our ever walking the same room without breaking it on purpose.\n\nHe goes, not into shadow, not into some conjuror\u2019s puff, but around the corner where men go when they don\u2019t want to be seen leaving. The boy with him glances back, his face uncertain where to put its anger now the man with the coat has taken his share of it, and I give him nothing, because I cannot keep feeding every stray anger that finds my doorstep. The nail looks at me. If I put it in the wrong place, the city will refuse to hang its picture straight ever again.\n\nNan is where she always is when you need her to be and never where you expect when you want to be scolded. Her door opens when my foot hits the second stair because we are not people who waste time pretending we didn\u2019t hear steps. The kitchen has decided to be warm out of sheer spite. The cat thinks the nail is food and then thinks better of confessing to that thought.\n\n\u201cHe sent you a card to use on his table,\u201d she says, giving the nail a look we usually save for men who want to teach us backgammon. \u201cDon\u2019t put it anywhere that thinks it is made.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do I put it,\u201d I ask, which is the question I should ask more often and don\u2019t because pride has a particular set of manners I haven\u2019t unlearned.\n\n\u201cIn your mouth,\u201d she says. \u201cWhere it cannot find purchase and where it will learn what words are for. Hold it till your spit knows its name. Then spit it somewhere that won\u2019t admit to having a floor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat will cost me,\u201d I say, and she nods, uninterested in my martyrdom.\n\n\u201cEverything costs,\u201d she says. \u201cToday I paid with the last good pot. Tomorrow I\u2019ll pay with an apology I do not mean. Stop acting surprised and you\u2019ll save us all time. Evie is bringing stews. The inspector is bringing serious men with strong words and small listening. Eat first. Then go up to the north door and have your argument. Make it a quiet one. There are children trying to learn that numbers hold still long enough to be counted.\u201d\n\nI fit the nail under my tongue the way I did with her name. It tastes metallic and adult and I do not enjoy it. It sits there, sulk incarnate, and confesses nothing. I take my bread and stew and am rude with both because I am a man who needs to be cheered on by soup. Over the rim of a chipped bowl we plan nothing and everything in that efficient way of two people who have learned that plans are what the day eats for lunch. When I go back out the city puts its hat on straight for me and I hate it a little for trying to be brave on my account.\n\nUp at the Cathedral\u2019s north door the mouth is no longer ajar; it smiles with all its teeth. The air coming through has the politeness of a doctor telling you a small operation will make you more yourself. I put my palm against the wood and my hand, to its great surprise, remains attached to my arm. The bells remember noon like a rumour they enjoy. The long line you only hear if you have been listening for it your whole life pulls a fraction tighter under the hill.\n\nThere are men gathered in the close with equipment that resents being made to work outdoors. Inspector Hallam is among them not looking like one of them and making them work anyway. She meets my eye with a look that saves my life a fraction, which is all anyone can ask. Evie arrives with a pan and a grin and no apology for the way her hair offends churches. Nan\u2019s cat is nowhere and everywhere as cats are when the night has decided to rent itself to men who use pencils.\n\n\u201cEverything we do now we do for one hour,\u201d Nan says at my shoulder, not being there and yet speaking. \u201cAfter that, we have to pay again. Don\u2019t waste it. And don\u2019t you dare be dramatic. It sours the milk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be brisk,\u201d I say, and the door laughs, which is an unsettling sound to hear from wood. It opens as if bowing the way kings think they know how, and there, inside, are the shadows for us to argue in and the long muscle of a building that has decided it will be loved even when we are bad at it. The nail tastes of the word no. I tuck it where I won\u2019t swallow it and step over the threshold before the city can change its mind and pretend it did not ask me to do any of this.",

Light arranges itself into polite ladders that do not reach the ground they promise, and the cold under the stone feels held there rather than being a natural state. The air is full of unspent ringing. It\u2019s the particular density a bell leaves in a room when it has decided not to speak but cannot resist inhaling as if it might. The nail sits under my tongue like a guest with an antique grievance, tasting of iron and a schoolroom where the chalk wrote long after the lesson dismissed.\n\nI keep the westward truth in my pockets and the northward lie in my mouth and walk with the care of a man crossing an unmarked ice pond. My shadow misbehaves at the edge of a pillar, splitting at the knees the way a promise splits when you try to turn it into a rule; I step forward and the halves consider me and reunite out of embarrassment rather than loyalty. It is the quiet that tells me where the fault runs. In a place like this, silence is a ledger. The entries do not add up. They have borrowed against the future.\n\nThe rope to the bells hangs in its well as docile as any beast in harness, but I can feel its fibers remembering a hand that told it thirteen and meant it as a kindness. My palms itch with the old recognition of wear. The rope has a way of seeing you when you look at it that makes it difficult to pretend you aren\u2019t the sort of man who was born to put his hands on things that move cities. I stand with the courtesy of a drinker facing the tap, say both names\u2014Nan\u2019s first, mine second\u2014and the rope settles its own small pride and looks away.\n\nSteps curl up toward the ringing chamber with that indecent mean streak spiral staircases keep for men in a hurry. The climb smells of oak, bat-dust, and half a hundred centuries of men making numbers behave by force of arm. I count and do not count, that old habit of mine that saves me when the angles go wrong, and feel the lag in the three beat trying to drag my feet behind me by the laces. The nail under my tongue hums when I pass the place where a rung tried to make itself into a door. I salivate from the pain of it, which is what it wants, and refuse it, which is what I want.\n\nAt the turn before the chamber, the air heaves. It\u2019s the sort of breath you hear in a theatre when the curtain sticks and the audience pretends not to be delighted. There\u2019s the long room again, not here but built into here, a slice of sideways hammered into the stair where the brickwork ought to be doing its one job. The handrail is a suggestion. The step is a sentence that cannot remember its verb. I plant my shoulders against both walls and remember being small enough to wedge myself in tight spaces because there was winter and there was a mother counting cupboards like they were friends.\n\n\u201cNone of that,\u201d I tell the stair well, and the stair well has the nerve to mind. The nail tastes of hot coins. There\u2019s no floor in the wrong place to spit on and nothing more offensive to this trick than being denied its own conditions. So I give it what it can\u2019t refuse. I bite down on the nail until my mouth is a bell of pain and spit as if I am rude in a house I respect, into the angle where air has decided to pretend to be load-bearing, and the spit strings in a bright line that the light cannot make up its mind to notice. It touches what does not exist and makes it show its face, a ripple of grey like a memory finding paper.\n\nThe room shivers, as much as rooms can shiver without doors to hold them together, and evicts itself from the stair with the sulky dignity of a cat leaving a party. The lag in the three-beat fails to find a place to put its foot and misses, once, then decides to march because stubbornness is old and has its own weather. The climb resumes being a climb. I go on, breath small, hand trailing the wall in that old thief\u2019s habit I like to pretend is a craft. When I reach the ringing chamber the light is wrong in a different, better way. It is quiet here and honest about it.\n\nThe bells wait like sleeping oxen. The big one has that imperial belly that makes men say names and women think about bread. The quarter bells hold their tongues in the particular manner of those instructed to watch their betters and report any impropriety. I touch nothing. Touch is the last resort. Instead I do the work my grandmother taught me under a table when men in coats too good for kitchens had gone home. I lay the last of Nan\u2019s sugar on the rim of the bell mouth in a line so fine the air has to try twice to taste it. Sugar remembers every mouth. Sugar is not fooled by rank.\n\nIt is ridiculous and that is why it works. The bell breathes out as if someone has pulled a bodkin from its corset. The big bronze throat finds the pitch it meant for noon and carries the faintest echo of a thirteenth in its mouth like the shadow of a tooth. My jaw aches with the nail; my tongue knows its name now and hates it, which is correct. Below us, the city cleaves in, listening for an hour that is not yet promised. I can hear Evie in my head scolding her till and the till making up its mind. I can feel Inspector Hallam stand very straight and place her hand on stone as if stones only behave when touched by people with tidy pockets. The bell thinks and then chooses. The choice is half mine and half the building\u2019s. I am not vain enough to claim more.\n\nThe first strike goes down the stairs with the controlled inevitability of a bowl passed from hand to hand. It is a sound thick enough to eat. It is a word spoken in a language the ground respects. Between the second and the third the old lag lifts its lazy head and finds no place to lie because I am there with the nail and the sugar and the habit of standing where things are supposed to be and saying so. I do not ring, which would be presumption. I attend, which is the work.\n\nOn the fifth strike a voice from the ladder loft above and the organ shadows makes that agreeable little noise people make when they have been served exactly what they ordered and were not expecting it. \u201cYou never disappoint me by being precisely what you are,\u201d Mr. Rook says conversationally, and it is his worst trick, that conversational tone in a place where everything else is trying to be a prayer. He doesn\u2019t make himself seen because he is a coward in that particular way men get who are certain they could win any argument but dislike discovering they won it for the wrong reason. \u201cDid you ruin your mouth for me. I am touched beyond the worth of the metal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will invoice you,\u201d I say through iron and spit, because we are a nation of men in trades and this is my dignity. \u201cYour bell won\u2019t take your extra. Go count somewhere without ceilings.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will teach her to like rooms with no roofs,\u201d he says mildly. \u201cAnd men who do not need them. But this, oh, this is charming. I had feared you would be all winter; I find instead you are a good July storm: harsh, productive, and liked by small boys who want their shirts off. Will you come up when you\u2019ve convinced her to be obedient. I have a view I am enjoying immensely and would hate to enjoy alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cNan says we are not men who go up when called,\u201d I say. \u201cThrow your view down if you want to share it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNan says a great many things,\u201d he replies, and there is that flicker of actual affection in it, which is the reason he gets away with so much. \u201cWe will speak later then. Make sure the twelfth is honest; she hates a liar more than I do.\u201d He withdraws himself the way a scent withdraws when a door opens, simultaneously present and offended at being asked to be obvious. The chamber relaxes, which is to say it stops reserving all adjectives for itself.\n\nI stand with the bell until it is over, because leaving before all twelve have completed is like walking away from a table before your host has lifted his glass. When the last note is still a taste on the air and not yet a word in an ear, I take the nail out of my mouth and hold it up where the dust motes might adjudicate its guilt. It\u2019s slick with spit and something else only bells carry. I do not put it away. I put it between my fingers and let my weight remember it again, the way you let a coin remember being spent.\n\nDescending is worse than climbing. It always is. The trick with a city like this is remembering the ground isn\u2019t something you reach; it is something that reaches for you when you are polite enough to stop pretending to be exceptional. At the bend where the long room wanted to be I find the evidence of it in the way of a bruise: a slightly cooler patch of stone, a draft in a place that has no permission for drafts, a shadow behaving as if someone has told it a secret and it is dying to be asked. I tell it to mind the weather and go on.\n\nIn the nave, men with tripods pretend they are cousins to men with ropes, which is a terrible family lie but one that keeps their hands busy. Inspector Hallam has set herself where she can see the north door and the verger, and the verger has set himself where he can insist the inspector is wrong but not say so out loud. Evie finds me as if I were a man with a plate at a buffet and she a woman who knows he will skip the greens. She pushes a wooden spoon at my chest and I eat because she made it and because I am going to faint otherwise and I am too old to enjoy fainting.\n\n\u201cWhat did you do to your mouth,\u201d she asks, which is another way of asking whether the bells are going to be untrue tomorrow and whether she should wheel out the good cakes for people who comfort themselves with sugar at bad hours.\n\n\u201cI kissed a nail,\u201d I say. \u201cIt will not be a habit.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake it a habit and I\u2019ll stop giving you buns,\u201d she says, which is the most serious threat anyone has made to me today. \u201cThe door smiled. I didn\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s learnt to be pleased with itself,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019ll be worse in an hour. We\u2019ve bought us that hour.\u201d\n\nInspector Hallam arrives without clicking, which is her own trick. She looks at the spoon in my hand with the particular disdain of a person who does not enjoy watching men be comforted in public and also always feeds people first when she has them in custody. \u201cIt sounded like an hour,\u201d she says. \u201cDoes it mean we can walk through one.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt means we can choose which,\u201d I say. \u201cTell your men to photograph nothing. Pictures will make it shy or vain. Neither is useful. Ask them instead to describe their feet and write down everything they left out.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll have them draw,\u201d she says crisply. \u201cHave you a list for me for when he does his next trick.\u201d\n\n\u201cBridges, chimneys, anything that runs a line between two things and calls itself useful,\u201d I say. \u201cIf someone offers to help you carry something up a set of stairs, refuse him. Rook is tickling the part of us that thinks lifting is proof of affection.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a very modern man,\u201d she says, bitterness so tidy you could put a stamp on it. \u201cAnd the Moor Gate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Moor Gate is going to ask us to remember her name,\u201d I say, and the ache behind my eyes is not the bell and not the nail, it is the long habit of a city refusing to say who did the work. \u201cWhen she does, don\u2019t tell her she was wrong. Just stand where she can hear your breath and let her count you. That part, at least, she is allowed.\u201d\n\nShe leaves me the way competent women leave dogs: with a pat that means both good work and do not jump up. Evie refills the spoon because she is also a competent woman and hates men who leave soup in the bottom of a bowl. The verger gives me the face gracious men give troublesome nephews at funerals, and I give it back, because the failure to exchange courtesies is how cities rot.\n\nThere is a letter in my pocket that is now water and ink in a saucer on Nan\u2019s table, and yet I can feel its shape as if paper could maintain the privilege of being solid after being drowned properly. Rook said the Moor Gate remembers her name and wants to be wed to country for an afternoon. He imagines it will be charming, like a festival where men bring pies and the pigs are dressed in bows. He has never stood on the path east of town and listened to hedgerow silence long enough to understand that field and street are married already and their argument is the only song we can afford.\n\nI have taken eight steps toward the north door before I realize I am walking again like a man who has forgiven the universe and that this cannot be allowed. I stop and test my weight the way a man tests a rope he has been given by a stranger. It holds, but the give in it is new. Nan\u2019s breath comes down a draught as if the house has turned its chimney into a telephone again. \u201cIf you can put the nail somewhere he cannot find, do it,\u201d she says, and I can hear her checking her watch by the heat of the kettle. \u201cHe\u2019ll prefer a maw. Give him a throat. Your choice.\u201d\n\nThe place inside the Cathedral that has a throat and denies it is the crossing, where nave and transept kiss and pretend it is on the cheek. Men put stones there and call them innocent. The city puts all her weight there because she knows what she\u2019s doing. If I give the nail to that mouth it will cost me my articulation; I will spend the next day talking like a man who had his tongue replaced by a coin. If I do not, Rook will find a knocker and teach it a new door.\n\nI am tired of choosing the expensive good, and this, above all, is why I must do it quickly. I walk to the crossing as if I am going to admire a saint and kneel as if I am going to apologise. There is a little seam where masons whose names I will never know kissed their work together and called it perfect because the man counting pennies frowned. I put the nail to my lip as if anyone is watching and might be fooled into thinking this is devotion, and I whisper my full name into the iron. I add my father\u2019s, because he is the sort of man whose name holds well in the mouth, and the boy\u2019s from the bridge, because he will need to learn what his name weighs. I put Nan\u2019s on last as you do the apron after everything else, the guarantee the day won\u2019t stain your skirt.\n\nWhen I push the nail into the seam I feel nothing and then a rush of every hurt a city runs its hands over and calls weather. It\u2019s too strong, that old grief, the raw end where the break happened. It could make me kneel all day. I refuse it and do the stupid little practical things that keep men upright. I look for the chip in the stone that will catch a nail head and hide it. I look for the scrap of old wax where a candle ran and a woman scolded and a sacristan blamed heat. I look for the long lost thread from some clerk\u2019s cuff that will keep a secret better than a saint. They are all there, because this is Lincoln, and old carelessness is our finest store. I tuck the nail in where it is least likely to pretend to be a story and most likely to pretend to be infrastructure.\n\nThe floor lifts its shoulder under my palm and returns to being the thing it always wanted to be, which is not a sermon and not a poem and not a trap. The long line I have always heard under the north door comes into tune with something over my left eye, which means we have an hour, and I can stop being a man full of craft and begin again being a boy with habits. I sit on the step near the font and shut my eyes because this is a gesture the building knows how to grade.\n\nWhen I open them, Mr. Rook is sitting on the edge of the font like a village groom too pleased with his own cuffs, his coat hung open in the manner of men comfortable with their sternums. He did not walk in; he is simply having been there for a portion of the morning we were not previously assigned. There is chalk on his fingers as if he has been teaching a child to draw ladders and has praised the boy for finding a way to climb without touching them.\n\n\u201cYour mouth,\u201d he says approvingly, which is another of his indelicacies. \u201cI did not believe you would do it. You are more devoted than your reputation allows. If I were a church I would envy the pew you warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have bad taste,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s a relief to be petty. \u201cGo home.\u201d\n\n\u201cHome is wherever the slope is steeper than it was an hour ago,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cDo you think you can keep this up for the week. It is a week, I think. That is what the sums told me when I pulled the old knot out at the Moor Gate. Seven days of the city refusing to be put down gently, and then the stammer takes, and then perhaps we are all new. Or very old. I can never tell which word is the right one for the things that matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can count to seven,\u201d I say. \u201cTry counting the people you hurt to get there.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey count themselves,\u201d he says, and he almost sounds wounded and I hate him for being good at that. \u201cI never had to teach men to put their hands in dangerous weights. They live for it. They call it love. They call it civic duty. They call it God.\u201d He leans forward, the water in the font forgetting to be water for a moment and remembering being mouth. \u201cDo you know why you make me polite, Silas. Because you are the only man I meet in this country who knows when to say please to a stone and mean it. I cannot decide if that makes you a fool or a king.\u201d\n\n\u201cKnots don\u2019t care,\u201d I say. \u201cThey care whether you keep them in use. You untied the wrong one. Tie it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot,\u201d he says, and his honesty is a blade you can cut fruit with. \u201cI am not the kind of body that can make that knot any longer. The keeper who could is in salt and patient. The next one has not been allowed a rope. We will have to do what we always do when we break something we need: improvise. It will be artistic. I am excellent when I am cornered. Do not you long for that kind of excellence.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I say, and it\u2019s the first true no I have permitted myself today. \u201cI long to buy carrots from a man and know that they are carrots and not an apology I am supposed to admire. I long for the clock to ring at the hour and the city to do the brave labour of pretending. I long for Evie to go home at three and be useless to men for two blissful hours. Your excellence can go and sit on the step until it stops demanding applause.\u201d\n\nHe grins like a boy who has found the one teacher who won\u2019t be charmed, and for a moment he is very handsome, and I remember the first time I saw him and felt my back go straight because I wanted him to like me which is the one thing about me I have never forgiven. \u201cCome to the Moor Gate,\u201d he says softly. \u201cBring your inspector and your girl with the clove breath and the woman with jam. Bring the boy who spit when I told him to be a man. Let us see if we can make a vow that doesn\u2019t cut an ankle.\u201d\n\n\u201cTonight,\u201d I say, because there is no point in not making the appointments men like him have arranged. \u201cAt dusk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt dusk,\u201d he repeats, making the word taste of honey and wrong decisions and the old trick of making evening feel like a wedding. \u201cDo not be late. The field is poor at waiting. It begins to grow things when left alone.\u201d\n\nHe gets up and walks exactly the three steps he\u2019s allowed before the building refuses to pretend to have doors where he needs them. He smiles at the stone for being reasonable and vanishes into a shadow he has had prepared for him from the beginning of the week. I exhale, which I had forgotten how to do with any ownership, and the nave puts itself in order with a sigh like sheets shaken out by a careful woman.\n\nWhen I come down the steps of the north door the light has moved left the way it does when you\u2019ve been inside a narrative longer than your body advised. The men with tripods have already decided to believe their photographs and fold their chairs. Inspector Hallam has already found a woman who will say she saw nothing and is trying to make that into a statement for a court. Evie has already put a bun in my pocket and told me if I don\u2019t eat it in ten minutes she will find a way to make my coat disgraced in public. Nan\u2019s cat appears from the bit of hedge that enjoys pretending to be brick and regards me with the respect due to a man who did a thing with sugar and didn\u2019t die of shame.\n\n\u201cDusk,\u201d I tell the inspector, and she doesn\u2019t ask for where because she has been a woman long enough to know that when a man says dusk in a town like this, there is only one where. \u201cBring men with rope and the old woman who tells ropes their manners and no one who will feel they ought to draft a press release afterward.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will bring a constable who grew up on the moor and pretends he didn\u2019t,\u201d she says. \u201cHe knows the names of birds that don\u2019t admit to living here. And Evie.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvie is self-invited,\u201d I say, and Evie nods, not in the manner of a woman invited but in the manner of a woman who has already put on her boots. \u201cNan will be there whether there is a door or only a suggestion and we will pay again, because we have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake your payments small,\u201d Nan says in my ear like the steam off a kettle. \u201cCoppers. Buttons. Promises you can afford to break without wishing you hadn\u2019t. He will try to make you spend notes. Tell him you haven\u2019t been to the bank.\u201d\n\nI walk down the hill not because I need anything at the bottom but because the hill needs reminding that I\u2019m here and will be again after I have pretended to sleep. Along Steep Hill the windows sugar themselves the way they do for tourists and witches. The butcher\u2019s sawdust is fresh and disguising nothing at all. A boy with a kite under his arm walks as if it has promised to behave; it has not. A woman in a yellow coat counts pigeons and comes to a number that does not comfort her and decides not to mind.\n\nAt home I wash my mouth out with tea and then with water and then with a swear word. The nail has left a shadow inside my cheek, which is absurd and exactly the sort of thing men write letters to doctors about and then throw the letters away because the post office cannot be expected to understand. I put my cheek to the cold window and the glass tells me the temperature of the day without language. A letter without a stamp would have felt loud in my pocket; there is none. The house tilts a fraction toward the west as if listening to the fields in anticipation and I tell it not to be rude.\n\nAfternoon is a waiting room. It is all the wrong magazines and a carpet that resents indoor shoes. I go to the market because men with knives there don\u2019t ask you to say why your hands are shaking; they ask if you want bones for broth and what you plan to do with the leeks. I buy carrots for the man who thinks he hates God and he looks at me as if I\u2019ve admitted to something indecent and in return gives me the one that is shaped like a Y, which feels like a blessing if you\u2019ve been in a tower this morning. I leave a coin under the bench where the apple went bad yesterday and a small girl finds it and hands it to her mother with the gravity of a magistrate.\n\nBy the time the hour grows toward dusk the city has put on its other face. The students are out practicing ambition. The gulls have taken their awful poetry to the river. Men who might have once enjoyed being told what to do wonder what it would be like to ask the evening for a favor. At Nan\u2019s door I take the jam saucer and the name that is not mine and the biscuit I will not admit to needing. She presses my hand and I let her because there are days when I do not have to earn it.\n\nWe walk east not in a procession but with the air of people who have all remembered the same story at once and intend to check the last paragraph was as they recall. Inspector Hallam strides like a woman who has had practice looking as if men with opinions don\u2019t ruin her shoes. Evie walks with a pan as if it were a shield. The constable from the moor has his hands in his pockets and his mouth thinking about thrushes. There are boys following us who think they are not, and Nan allows it because letting them think they invented themselves is part of her sport.\n\nThe path to the Moor Gate is always shorter when you tell someone you know where it is, which is the path\u2019s way of keeping pride. Hedges receive us like a congregation that isn\u2019t sure it approves of the sermon but is fond of the choir. The ditch holds its iron to itself. The stone circle looks less like a circle today and more like a set of teeth in a mouth that forgot to close. The hollow has more in it than light and less in it than water. Rook is there, of course, because punctuality is a courtesy and he will have all of them as long as we insist on playing at the front door.\n\nHe is hatless, which on him looks like the page of a book you weren\u2019t supposed to find, and the coat has resigned itself to being decoration. Around him men stand who have been told they are useful in a way that will encourage them to tell their sons to be less soft. A woman stands with them whose wrist I met this morning sitting like grief, and she has a rope coiled at her feet in the way of a lover who knows how to be patient and dangerous in a good order. The field smells of old fire and July rain and whatever it is that lives under chalk.\n\n\u201cLadies,\u201d Rook says politely, and he means it, which is why Nan curtsies just low enough to ruin his confidence for a minute. \u201cGentlemen. Worlock. Welcome to the afternoon married to an idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo vows without witnesses,\u201d Nan says, and sets the saucer in the grass where the loop of wire once was. \u201cNo rope without hands that know names. No ring without someone to say this is a bad idea and we will do it anyway.\u201d\n\nHallam steps to where I told her before she was told, because a woman like her hears the instruction you lay into a day before you realize you\u2019ve spoken. Evie stands with her pan as if it were a bell in its own right. The constable takes his hands out of his pockets, which means the moor has accepted him for the evening.\n\nRook is all grace, the worst kind, the borrowed sort. \u201cWe will speak each where we stand,\u201d he says, as if he has invented prayer. \u201cWe will ask the town to loosen its belt and the field to put on a coat. We will look for the line between and ask it to be a table for once.\u201d He looks at me with that intimate interest that has made the lives of better men difficult. \u201cYou will tell your city not to be afraid. You are very good at that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell her she is allowed,\u201d I say, which is as near to kind as I am capable of toward a man who has made the day into a classroom.\n\nThe rope is very old and very new. It smells of hair and hemp and winter laundry and men\u2019s wrists. The woman with it lifts it without drama, and I know before she speaks that she is a keeper whether she was given a word for it or not. She looks at Nan and something passes that is not jam and not tea but is the heart of those. She looks at Inspector Hallam and something passes that is not a warrant and not a pardon. She looks at me as if I am the posture of a thing she has had to carry and is deciding if I am worth it.\n\n\u201cWe will do this the ugly way,\u201d she says. \u201cWe tried the pretty way and it cost the wrong house a son. Stand where you belong. If the ground gives you a word, keep it. If it gives you a weight, do not pass it to any child. If Mr. Rook asks you to shake his hand, spit. If the city asks you to say her name back to her, say it with your mouth and not with your bones.\u201d\n\nRook bows, delighted, because he thinks he invented ugly. He draws the rope along the line where the hollow decided to be an old pond and we discovered it had ideas. He makes it look like a dance, which is a lie. The rope hisses against stone the way sugar fizzes in tea when you wanted it to behave. The hedges lean. The tiny birds that never get named because people name only the birds they kill or bound look all at once in the same direction and then at their own feet.\n\nI am no longer cold by then, which is wrong. My hands are their own temperature. The beat under the north door is not under the north door anymore; it is in my chest, where it can do the least good and the most damage. I think of ladders down wells and the peculiar hope of an end that is also a beginning and how that hope is the only thing a man like Rook needs to ruin a county. I hold the shape of my name in my mouth like a marble and wait for the field to decide whether to be polite.\n\nIt is the Moor Gate that speaks first, because she has aged badly and is not going to be talked over by a younger Stone with less experience. She does not say words. She rattles the bony bit of the landscape. She knocks four times on an old board and coughs. She asks us if we remember the winter where a girl with a red hat counted sheep into the fog and never out again. She says the numbers: three with a lag. She says them as a warning and a brag.\n\nRook tugs his coat straight like a boy in church. \u201cThere,\u201d he whispers, as if someone might take offense. \u201cThere. She remembers. Now the fun part.\u201d\n\nHe means the part where he gets to play at being the man who never gets to be a keeper and never had a rope offered to him and has made the world pay for it. He means the bit where he persuades the town to step down from its hill for a minute and trial walking flat, and the bit where the field is allowed to climb without being told to wipe its feet. He means the kiss that isn\u2019t one and the vow that cannot be kept without something else being thrown away.\n\nNan coughs like a warning under a hymn. I take the saucer of jam in both hands and draw the line where I cannot see it, the mean small circle that keeps big foolishness from convincing itself it\u2019s universal. The woman with the rope nods, once, to me, and once to Hallam, and once to Evie, because she understands what kitchens have done to keep the world from collapsing. On the rope, under Mr. Rook\u2019s fingers, there is a tremor as if a fish has remembered water and decided to sing.\n\n\u201cNow,\u201d the keeper says, and her voice is not mine and not Rook\u2019s and not the city\u2019s, it is the moor\u2019s, and we obey because there are moments when disobedience is the wrong kind of art. The weight comes up under our feet as if the field has decided to be generous. The town declines a fraction as if relieved of a duty it took on without consent and is discovering that consent is an art too. The air in the hollow flips like a coin.\n\nFor a breath, only one, I feel the whole thing tilt. It isn\u2019t dramatic. It\u2019s domestic. It\u2019s the difference between a table that\u2019s set and a table that\u2019s been cleared, that mysterious lightness that lives in a room when the plates are gone and the questions are about to sit down where dinner was. Rook laughs softly, delighted, because he thinks this is the proof the world wanted, and for him it is, and for me it isn\u2019t, and for the moor it is a relief.\n\nHe pulls. The rope answers. The city makes a noise I have only ever heard in men\u2019s throats when they have been told at last that it is not their job anymore and they can go to bed. The field makes the noise cows make when the gate opens and they were not expecting kindness. Men on the line confirm to themselves that they are strong and useful and required. It is a terrible sound and a beautiful sound and I would like to drink water. I do not move.\n\n\u201cKeep your feet,\u201d Nan says. \u201cKeep your names. Keep your tempers.\u201d\n\nThe rope bites Rook\u2019s hand at the place where a man\u2019s pride lives and he enjoys it because there is something wrong with him that cannot be cured by a mother and a clean kitchen. He calls out a number that is a lie and the rope tries to learn it. The moor hisses like rain, refuses, and insists on its own counting. The inspector says noon into the hedgerow like it owes her a favor and the hedgerow is so surprised it offers her four. Evie bangs her pan, which is the sound of a bell that does not want to be a bell, and the field accepts it as an argument.\n\nI feel the north door under my feet again. I feel the Stonebow in the place where my left wrist goes when I am trying not to hit anyone. I feel the Roman gate sharpen its knife against an old complaint and put it away because today is not for ancient slights. I feel a ladder somewhere that does not lead to any of this at all and that scares me more than anything else in the afternoon. I take a pinch of salt and throw it over my shoulder with the incorrigible superstition of a man who has already spent too much cleverness.\n\nRook looks up from his rope like a man interrupted in the very act of being himself. \u201cNot yet,\u201d he says, mildly cross. \u201cI haven\u2019t made the invitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe field made it for you,\u201d I say. \u201cYou\u2019re late to your own party.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hate that,\u201d he says, and his teeth show for a second as if the boy under the coat has decided to come out and kick a can. He pulls hard. The rope strains. The moor laughs, which is a frightening sound if you are fond of furniture, and the town remembers its weight all at once and decides to keep it.\n\nThere is a sound like a bell trying to ring backward and the rope snaps out of his hand as if hive bees live in it. The keeper catches the coil with her hips and her history. Inspector Hallam\u2019s man from the moor puts his shoulder into air where air needs a shoulder. Evie drops her pan on purpose and claps because sometimes you encourage the room like a child. Nan says a word that is neither Latin nor housewifery and the hollow fills with the idea of water and then changes its mind because she asked nicely.\n\nIt is not a victory. I am not so cheap as to call it that. It is the art of an hour\u2019s permission. It is the way a gate is persuaded to close at dusk so the sheep will do the labor of staying alive themselves. Mr. Rook shakes his offended hand with good humor because what else can he do. He bows to the keeper the way a polite burglar bows to a dog that didn\u2019t bite. He looks at me with that expression he reserves for the moments when he is most dangerous: amused, impressed, a little hungry, and with the ruins of a boy\u2019s longing behind his teeth.\n\n\u201cYou will run out of sugar,\u201d he says. \u201cYou will run out of names. You will run out of boys who spit. I will still be here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will run out of you,\u201d I say, and it is not bravado. It is fatigue. It is love. It is the hope that makes a poor superstition an honest skill. \u201cAnd the city will still be here.\u201d\n\nHe inclines his head as if I have said something he is saving for later, to throw back at me when he wins, or to remember when he loses. He steps back and the rope makes a face at him that is not human and very familiar. He laughs. He vanishes. He does not go into the hedge because the hedge would not have him. He simply disappears into the gap you rent when you refuse to be ordinary long enough and the afternoon forgets to charge you.\n\nWe stand and do not do the thing men do after exertion, which is make noise and pretend they meant the noise to be laughter. We breathe. The keeper unwinds the coil with the air of a woman taking her hair down after a funeral. Inspector Hallam puts her hand back in her pocket and her steadiness takes a bite of the evening. Evie picks up her pan and licks jam off her thumb with a wickedness that redeems gardens. Nan looks at me as if I am a piece of furniture she loves and is going to scold for letting itself be scratched. The field decides to be field again with the serene self-respect of a body rebuttoning after trying on someone else\u2019s shirt.\n\n\u201cHome,\u201d Nan says, because she knows what to say when there is nothing to say. \u201cEat. Sleep if you can without making a mess of it. If you dream, tell no one belonging to the church. Tomorrow has plans for us. We will plan nothing and be ready for everything and do it while the kettle thinks about boiling.\u201d\n\nI walk with Evie for part of the way because the river would like to admire her, and it never hurts the river to be taught its manners by someone who gives away buns against her better judgement. We do not speak of rooms without walls. We talk about the idiocy of men who refuse change for breakfast and eat it at lunch. We talk about the Inspector\u2019s hair and whether it was always that serious. We talk about whether the cat belongs to Nan or Nan belongs to the cat, and I am kind enough to suggest the paternity may be shared.\n\nAt my door the key clears its throat and behaves. The house admits me with the wary hospitality of a creature that has been visited by a man who means well and leaves dust. I put my hand to my mouth to test whether I have stopped bleeding from the inside where manners live, and it is only sweetness and metal and the taste of the bell\u2019s courtesy. On the table there is something not a letter and not a tool: a white feather in a circle of blue thread, the fleck of gold caught in the twist. It is not a message from Rook. The handwriting around it is no handwriting anybody living bothers to learn.\n\n\u201cThree,\u201d it says in that script objects use when they forget how to be quiet. \u201cBut teach her to count seven on her fingers and forgive herself the lag.\u201d\n\nIt is the Cathedral\u2019s idea of a joke, or the city\u2019s idea of a kindness, or the moor\u2019s idea of a dare. I put the feather in the jam saucer and the thread over the windowsill where the cat will find it and misbehave. I sit, and the chair chooses not to creak because small mercies are the ones that take you by surprise. It is dusk. It is the hour courtesies lick their thumbs and press down the corner of the page so they can find their place again in the night.\n\nI do not sleep yet. I make the night tea and tell it not to gossip. I wash my hands with the seriousness of a surgeon and the superstition of a dock worker. I stand at the window and look out at a city that has forgiven me my weight for a day and will use it again tomorrow whether I want to be used or not. I take the coin from the bridge boy out of my pocket and put it on the sill and tell it to watch for footsteps that do not belong to anyone. It shines, which is all any of us can do with the hours we buy at the price available. I put my head down on the table and for a minute or two I know how to be ordinary, which is a spell I will never learn to cast on purpose, and then the bus sighs past and the house shifts and the bells remember the quiet they earn, and I am ready to be taken by the kind of sleep that does not teach me anything and is therefore a gift.",

The feather in its circle of blue thread has crusted a little with jam where I set it, gold fleck caught in the twist like a moth that chose its trap. The word it left behind\u2014three\u2014has not moved off the table, which is a comfort because there are words that go walking when your back is turned. I drink tea that pretends to be practical and tells me I look better in a kitchen than the night lets on. The coin from the bridge boy watches the window like a doorman with standards. The house has given back the inches it tilted yesterday toward the fields and resettled its shoulders as if it closed a book at the right place and remembered where it put its glasses.\n\nIf I were a man who made lists, today\u2019s would be a mean one. Seven acts, small enough to pass for courtesies if anyone asks, heavy enough to make a building change its breath. The feather\u2019s joke is a dare; the Cathedral counts in threes with that tired lag and needs teaching a different meter, not because seven is holy and three is common, but because the wrong men have been flattering the wrong number and an honest alternative would do everyone good. Nan told me once you can teach a house to keep time if you braid seven strands of something it already loves and hang them where drafts call themselves customers. I do not have seven strands of anything except habit and worry. Both will have to serve.\n\nNan\u2019s door opens before I knock, which is not courtesy so much as a woman deciding time spends better if it is used for bread and not formalities. She has a biscuit tin older than three of my decisions sitting on the table and within it the city\u2019s version of thread: seven things that never go out of fashion. A button from a school cardigan that held a boy together in winter. A safety pin that pretends it is a small sword. A stub of pencil bitten smooth by a mother who did not have time to be angry. A twist of hair tied with red string. A spent match that remembers a candle better than the man who lit it. A washer from a bolt that kept a gate honest. A postage stamp with no country on it that has nevertheless delivered very important messages between hands.\n\n\u201cUse these,\u201d she says, not romantic about any of it. \u201cYou can leave sugar everywhere until the day closes its teeth on your fingers, but if you want a church to follow you when you change the pace, give it the syllabus it understands. Work, children, rope, fire, door, letter. If he borrowed our wards because his own failed, we will borrow everything back and call it laundry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll need stairs,\u201d I say, because the first time you teach anything it is good to be above the room where your work collects. \u201cAnd a dislike of drama.\u201d\n\n\u201cTake my dislike,\u201d she says, and I put it in my pocket with the rest of my uncharms. \u201cIf anyone says the word ritual in your hearing before tea, make them carry the coal. I\u2019ll see to chimneys. He has ears up them. They listen where they should breathe. The inspector will take the arch. Evie will discipline her door. You will start with the bell\u2019s second cousin and remind her to be content with being a kind of mother.\u201d\n\nInspector Hallam arrives in that tidy manner that makes men stand up even when they promised themselves not to be impressed again. She looks at the button tin, registers without moving a muscle that we are going to nail the day to the table with small things, and tells me the Stonebow would like to be reassured before lunch that it will not have to learn to pronounce thirteen after all. Evie comes in on the weather; she has a pan under one arm and a ledger under the other and the pan is the one she will use to censure any bell that forgets itself.\n\n\u201cAlso,\u201d Evie says in a tone that makes the room put its shoes on, \u201ca man with two shadows bought a coffee and told the sugar to behave. It did not. He left chalk on the counter in the shape of a ladder that goes down.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak to no one standing in two shadows,\u201d Hallam says crisply, reminding both of us that she listens to our letters even when we do not want her to. \u201cIf they stand still, move. If they move, hum. The humming makes them admit they are only one person after all.\u201d\n\nNan smears jam on a saucer and writes seven on it with the knife until the number remembers what it is for. She breaks the day up like hard toffee and hands us our pieces. I take the Cathedral, because my name has been threatening to be married to its stairwell for years and I may as well see how the domestic arrangement looks in daylight. The inspector goes to her arch with a man from the moor whose job is to know what silence weighs. Evie returns to her till with the fervour of a woman determined to reassure a door it is not a mouth. Nan vanishes in that way she has where you can still smell tea and feel your hair being combed and yet also know she is halfway across the city muttering instructions up chimneys and warning them not to eavesdrop when it is not their turn.\n\nInside the Cathedral the air is the colour of melted coin. The big spaces would like to be impressive and get over with it so they can be comfortable again. I go the slow way, past the quiet corners where wood teaches patience and stone learns to forgive knees, and I lay a lesson in seven parts where no verger needs to write me into a logbook. Under the misericords I tuck the school button, because boys have always learned here to hold still and sometimes they should be allowed to keep their pockets. On the step up to the choir I pin the safety pin into a crack where it can pretend to be a hinge and hold two songs together, one for the living and one for those who cannot carry a tune anymore. At the font I leave the stub of pencil in the lip where history nibbles and makes remarks, because if you do not give a church something to write with, it will use your bones.\n\nI thread the twist of hair into the rope where fingers calluses grew before mine, murmuring two names and a third I will never say out loud, and I feel the long beat in the city shrug and shift its weight as if something it had decided not to mind yesterday has decided to be minded today. On the north transept\u2019s doorframe a spent match slides into a flaw that has trapped worse tempers and seems content to behave. At the west door I set the washer where the light can use it to pretend it is a coin and pay for its own entry. The stamp I take up the stairs to the ringing chamber and stick beneath the beam with spit, because a letter that remembers travel in its skin might make a bell remember sending and not just calling.\n\nThe seventh thing is always the one you do not plan for. At the turn where the long room once put its shoulder into the stair, a girl with a choir book is standing with all her attention in the place her second shadow is trying to be and not quite managing it. She is ordinary in that exemplary way of people who mean to be, hair pulled back by the world with elastic, fingers inked by the notes she copied when somebody forgot the photocopier had a song of its own. She looks at me without fear or expectation and I like her immediately because she has not learned yet to perform panic for men to rescue. Her second shadow is a neat little lie, offset by a long inch to the left, impatient with the wall.\n\n\u201cDo I have to ask who you are,\u201d she says, which is neither rude nor pious and leaves me nowhere to play a part.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the man who is about to ask you whether you have slept,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd then tell you it isn\u2019t a test of character. Your other shadow is waiting to see if you\u2019ll turn your head so it can get in behind your eyes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes that work,\u201d she asks, as if she has half a mind to let it try, because people are kind to even their own traps if those traps have good posture.\n\n\u201cIt makes you hum a note no one else can hear,\u201d I say. \u201cIt turns kindness into a performance and then offers to sell tickets. What\u2019s your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cRos,\u201d she says, frowning at the step as if the step has asked an impertinent question about her shoes. \u201cRosamund when my mother wants to talk about money. I had a dream where the stave was missing a line. I came to look at the organ as if it could apologise.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d I say, and I hate how stern it comes out and do not take it back. \u201cDon\u2019t look at it. Look at me. Hum me a seven.\u201d\n\nShe tries, fails at four because the city puts a foot out to trip her, laughs without permission and tries again, this time in that stubborn small way that takes the day and pins it to the board by the corner. The second shadow misses its chance and sits down like a sulky child because it has been denied the drama it needs to be interesting. I stand on its second mouth with my heel until it forgets the words it was going to put in Ros\u2019s mouth, and when she finishes the seven in a crooked time that I envy, the stair gives up being a corridor to nowhere and remembers how to go upstairs.\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d I say, which is more than praise and less than comfort. \u201cIf anyone offers you a room without walls, ask them where the coat hooks are. If they say honest rooms don\u2019t need them, leave.\u201d\n\nShe nods like a person who owns two good nods and has given me one and is saving the other for her mother and a conversation about money and choirs. On my way down I feel the building try the seven and fail and try again and put the lag in a different place where it can\u2019t break as many ankles. I don\u2019t know if I taught it anything. I know it is listening.\n\nI am out of small things and twenty minutes richer when the telephone that does not belong to me rings in a patch of cold by the north door. The effect is so barefaced I want to scold Rook for clumsiness and then I hear Hallam\u2019s voice finding a way to be brisk without becoming unkind. She has a chimney that has swallowed a Monday and is now trying to push a Wednesday down the flue to compensate. The woman whose house it is is using a jam jar as if it were a rosary. There is a wolf in the sound the child\u2019s room is making, but not a wolf from here. She tells me to bring salt and whatever it is I bring when I pretend to be sensible.\n\nThe house is the sort that wears brick as if it\u2019s a cardigan and checks the pocket for change when men are not looking. The woman at the door wears grief on her wrist like a watch and relief on her mouth like a swear word. The child has arranged her toys to face the fireplace in the understanding that if something is going to come out, it is polite to be looking at it. The wolf is in the drag of the draw. It isn\u2019t a wolf. It is a man\u2019s trick taught to a chimney to make it appreciate being a throat. I kneel and lay my hand flat on the tile in front of the grate because chimneys lie when you touch their bricks but tell the truth to floors.\n\n\u201cMr. Rook,\u201d I say to the living room, because I am tired of couriers who pretend to be furniture. \u201cYou have to borrow smarter than this. There are children in this house and the jam is better than you deserve.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t answer, which is polite for a man who cannot resist himself. The flue lowers its voice as if to lean closer with its ear. I take the sugar line out of my pocket, the last little grammar of it I scraped off the ringing beam with a nail scraped off my tongue. I lay it across the hearth like a seamstress telling cloth the truth about itself. I whisper the seven under my breath in the sort of rhythm men remember from trains and bad hearts and the long walk to a job they love. The wolf in the noise stops pretending to be a wolf and confesses to being wind. Wind is a poor liar when its cheeks are full of smoke and it knows it. The jam jar trembles and stops and my mouth fills with the taste of a park in summer when someone opens a flask and says the right names in the wrong order and suddenly everyone\u2019s feet have rhythm again.\n\n\u201cPut salt in your pocket,\u201d I tell the child, who is seven because of course she is and smiles like a person who was born tired of being lied to. \u201cIf the chimney talks again, tell it a recipe. It will listen. Chimneys are all recipes pretending not to be.\u201d\n\nOutside, Hallam has rung her men off and allowed herself one second of standing with her head against the brick as if the wall is her friend and will not gossip. The constable from the moor hums something that is either birds or a tune his grandmother taught him when the kettle was on and the world was a size smaller. Across the street a man laughs too loudly at his own joke and the laugh comes back with someone else\u2019s timing and he looks at his shoe as if it has, at last, betrayed him.\n\n\u201cYou said seven,\u201d Hallam says as we walk, not touching, which is our custom. \u201cWhat is seven for you. We have officers who cannot get their heads around it and a mayor who will get out his pen and write seven in a speech as if that will teach the river to time itself for photographs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeven is the number you use when you need a stubborn hour to sit,\u201d I say. \u201cHe is making three trip over itself. I can either pick up the three and move it, or I can put a seven down until he gets bored. He will get bored. He is a boy with beautiful manners. Boys like that never keep a toy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say boy with the care of a man trying not to pity,\u201d she says, considering not me but the air in front of us as if it owes her money. \u201cTell me if I should pity. I will do it in private if it\u2019s required.\u201d\n\n\u201cPity is expensive,\u201d I say. \u201cSave it for widows who have lost Monday.\u201d\n\nAt the coffee shop a door is being disciplined with charm and a cloth. Evie\u2019s chalkboard has found itself right side up without anyone embarrassing it in public. The bell under the till has sulked itself into a mood and now it sulks of its own accord, which is a safer place for sulking. A man with two shadows stands outside long enough to be told the door is busy and then leaves with a face that would like to complain to a manager. Evie flips a cup in her hand and tells me to stop letting my mouth look like a sentence that will disappoint a school.\n\n\u201cHe came in,\u201d she says, not lowering her voice because there is no use. \u201cHe asked for milk and then told the milk to think about snow. It tried. I put a spoon in it and told the spoon about ships. We made peace. Then he stood where he could have two shadows and didn\u2019t like the taste of my stare.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feed them sugar with such bad grace,\u201d I say, and she grins because she knows I mean he will come back and try harder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give him salt,\u201d she says. \u201cHe can improve his palate. There\u2019s a girl been sitting outside writing in a music book with her head cocked like she\u2019s listening to a bus that won\u2019t arrive. She looked at two boys this morning like she was trying not to love both and I thought, well, that\u2019s everyone\u2019s fault. I gave her a bun without telling her and she gave it to a pigeon without bothering to admire itself first. I thought you\u2019d like her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve met her,\u201d I say, because the day has decided to be efficient with introductions. \u201cShe hums a seven you could set a floor to. If Rook has any sensibility left in his expensive bones, he will leave her alone because the first time he is genuinely loved by a room, he will not know what to do with it.\u201d\n\nAt the library the local history shelves have bred a pamphlet while my back was turned and it has the decency to pretend it belongs. I slide it out and find in it a blueprint traced by hand that is not an architect\u2019s, but a lover\u2019s, all lingered lines and corrections and little apologies written in the margins to rooms that never quite forgave. The title page is sure of itself. \u201cSeven corners to keep a tongue,\u201d it says, and I would laugh if I had anything to do with sensible air. Wren\u2019s wrong boy drew this or the man who kept him from falling long enough to teach a city to speak. The corners are not corners in any practical sense. They are the places where breath collects and must be reminded to leave.\n\nI spend an hour pencilling the day a map will allow you to pencil and not be told off. The Stonebow, the crossing, the west door lintel, the well that is dry but keeps its ladders because ladders like to be kept, the Roman arch where a knife once sharpened itself in public, the library\u2019s stairs that have always imagined they are the backs of animals, the bridge that only believes it is a bridge when boys are standing on it deciding to be men. If you put a small obedience at each and then ask the building to choose the beat it prefers, seven will look like mercy and three will look like cleverness, and the Cathedral, which was not built to adore cleverness, will take the offer nearest its original humility. I tear the pamphlet in half because sometimes you have to make a thing new to get any use out of it and tuck the half with the corners into my coat where it can keep my ribs from behaving with too much vanity.\n\nIn the afternoon when the long light makes everyone better looking than they deserve, a letter appears under the coffee shop door with no stamp and poor handwriting and too much attention from the paper to the pen that wrote it. Evie slides it over the counter with a finger and refuses to ask me to perform any more small magics than I already have; the refusal is a tenderness I do not know what to do with. The letter smells of chalk and old books and the particular dust that climbs out of organ pipes on days when the choir is too beautiful for the building and everyone agrees not to speak of it.\n\nHe does not begin with Dear. He writes like a man who has found a way to write to himself and detests the novelty of a second person. He tells me he has made a room that knows how to keep a choir together without a conductor. He says he is not going to use it on Sundays because he is not vulgar. He says he is going to teach the city to stand between beats and enjoy the hurt. He says he has remembered where the dry well is and has found a ladder that has never learned how to go up. He says tonight the wolves will hear the dead walking under the river and come to the bank to listen with good manners. He says if I am any kind of worlock I will come to the water and behave.\n\nI want to burn the letter because it will put ideas into objects and then claim the objects had the ideas first, but Evie gives me a look that is both mother and magistrate and I put it in the sink and open the tap and make the letter learn how to be a good guest. The water reads it out loud with a hiss, because it cannot help showing off, and then cannot remember a word of it. I dry my hands on a cloth that has been drying hands for a decade and tastes like butter and grief. Evie puts a bun in my pocket without pretending it is for later.\n\nAt the Stonebow the pigeon has returned to the decent clean patch and is practicing contempt for men whose hats are too proud. Inspector Hallam has the expression of someone who is going to tell the arch a story until it cannot remember the new ending Mr. Rook gave it. The constable from the moor stands like a notched stick used to measure river depth and hums softly without thinking any of us can hear. We touch the stone like men touching a horse that doesn\u2019t belong to them and ask it to count seven on its old bones. It does not, not yet, but it thinks about it and agrees to consider doing it on the hour when no one is looking.\n\nBy the time the river smells like sound and boys are practicing standing still on bridges without setting the sky on fire, the wolves are in the noise. It isn\u2019t a pack. It\u2019s the shape of hunger with a name. The dead walking under the water do not mind being overheard; they have the arrogance of tides. I take the long route past the Roman gate and the shop that is haunted by its ambition and the bench where the heart carved around D + M stopped beating after the second handful of coins and has been waiting for a man to admit it. The swans have installed themselves with their usual posture of sainthood waiting to be asked about tax. The girl with clove breath is on the far bank, a shape that knows a rope has been thrown to her whether or not she wants it, and the boy from the bridge throws stones into the shallow water with that false casualness boys develop to make everyone else forget they are practicing mercy.\n\nRook is on the quay with his coat open and his hands in his pockets like a man who gets away with everything at meetings because the chair likes his cousin. The chalk on his cuffs is deliberate. He looks like any man who has been told a story about his own usefulness and has taken it too far in the direction of kindness. He nods to me as if we are men who meet to count the receipts after a fair. He inclines his head to the river and the river ignores him in the way of dignities older than politeness.\n\n\u201cWorlock,\u201d he says with the faint admiration of someone who likes the mouthfeel of someone else\u2019s title. \u201cShall we call them, then. You like a test. I like a choir. The wolves prefer a choir to a soloist.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you whistle,\u201d I say, \u201cthey\u2019ll come with bad manners. If I hum, they\u2019ll come with better. You don\u2019t have to like the difference. You just have to admit it exists.\u201d\n\nHe smiles in the manner of men who have been complimented on their suits too often and bowed to at funerals they spoiled by speaking. He gestures to the water as if offering me a stage and I do the one thing he cannot stand: I ignore him and ask the river if it wants company. There is a foulness in my mouth at the question, like I have licked a coin again, and I think fondly of nails and spit and the sugar line, and decide to use none of them because there are days that the old tricks only please the wrong audience.\n\nI hum the seven Ros hummed because it is crooked and it owes nothing to fashion. I pitch it where the arches under the bridge keep their cooler air and the weed knows how to wave without trying to be a woman\u2019s hair. The wolves are in the river\u2019s hearing before a minute has taken off its shoes, not as beasts in the flesh, but as patience, a sharpness under stillness, an expectation the city would like to learn and cannot because it has learned performance instead. Mr. Rook\u2019s mouth opens a fraction because he cannot help loving anyone who calls the right thing by its first name without making an entrance, and I file that away for something later, perhaps when all this is a table with cups put away and a small emergency finding its way to its bed.\n\n\u201cPolite wolves,\u201d he says, showing me his clean palms like a man remembering his catechism. \u201cIf you leave them their ears, they leave you your feet. Wherever did you learn that.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom women,\u201d I say, because it is not clever and therefore it is true. \u201cAnd from hedges. And from the part of the city that does not like you but leaves a biscuit on your step because it cannot help remembering when you were the right kind of hungry.\u201d\n\nSomething crosses the bridge. It is not a person. It is the shape left when a ladder is taken away from a well and men keep looking at the aperture because looking at it between chores makes them feel like someone important might have died there and they might be asked to carry a corner of the procession. Boys stop pretending not to shiver. The girl with clove breath puts her hand in her coat pocket where salt lives and the swans decide to be statues just to see how we look when we think they cannot see us.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t bring the nail,\u201d Mr. Rook observes, and if he were less vain I would give him credit for pretending to be sorry. \u201cYou put it somewhere your mouth couldn\u2019t get it back and if you had a mirror I would pay to watch you tell yourself you did the correct thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rule about paying to watch men tell themselves things,\u201d I say, and he laughs in that private way where only his ribs get to enjoy the joke. \u201cI taught her a seven. She will teach herself the rest. The Wolves will mind me if I mind them. Don\u2019t you put your hand in.\u201d\n\nRook is a boy who has never been told not to put his hand in anything in public. He cannot help himself; he puts his hand in. The shape from the ladder has been waiting for that hand and intends to keep it the way a city gate likes to keep glove leather. He hisses\u2014not in pain, he would never allow himself pain in front of me, but in embarrassment, which is better. The wolves in the sound change their weight and I put mine down and we have a small argument about who gets to own the hour and the bridge remembers it has always liked the boy who throws stones and sides with me.\n\nIt is ugly, which is the correct way for some good work to be. I count backward from seventeen because numbers that are not fashionable make Rook lose the thread. I put the coin in my left shoe and the boots remember their job. I tell the girl with clove breath to recite the names of streets she has walked at dusk when she was not afraid and her mouth becomes the kind of weapon men will talk about after and wish they had learned sooner. Rook\u2019s wrist comes back with his hand attached, less from my care than from the river\u2019s boredom. He looks at me with that hot sting in his eyes he has for people who refused to admire him correctly, which is to say kindly.\n\n\u201cSeven,\u201d he says, as if it is a complaint. \u201cYou will run it like a seam until the day catches itself on a nail and bleeds on the stair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen we will wash the stair,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd someone will bring bread and we will sit on the steps and be ordinary for a whole minute. It will be the best part of the day and you will have missed it because you were drawing ladders on the wall.\u201d\n\nHe looks at my hands, and then at the river, and then at the girl on the far bank who has not taken her hand out of her pocket because she understands what pockets are for. He inclines his head to the wolves in the polite way a man bows to a dog that refuses food. He takes his chalk out of his cuff and breaks it in half and drops one piece into the water like a coin and keeps the other in his fist like a tooth. The wolves listen until they are done and then do what wolves do when they would prefer not to be seen leaving; they are simply not there where you look and afterwards you wonder if you made them up.\n\nWhen it is over the river clears its throat and pretends not to have been part of any of this. Boys begin to be stupid again with relief and this is a mercy disguised as irritation. The swans take up their employment with smugness that somehow does not nauseate me. Mr. Rook\u2019s hand, when he pulls it from his pocket where he has warmed it for show, is fine and he will pretend it was never in danger because that is how he manages not to die when he deserves to. He taps two fingers against the bridge rail as if that does anything here and steps away not because I told him to but because he has other rooms without walls to polish and other boys to make think they can choose the day\u2019s ending.\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d he says lightly, which is a threat he keeps like a flower pressed between bad pages. \u201cBring your seven and your jam and your unglamorous kindness. I will bring a number I haven\u2019t tried yet and a man who wears two shadows because one is doing a poor job. We will stand the town and the field and the river and the sky in a circle and ask them if they like one another. We will not take no for an answer.\u201d\n\nNan appears on my right where I had not saved a space for her and therefore am humbled. She smells of chimneys that have been told to mind themselves and the kind of tired that would never get caught acting like it wants applause. She leans on the rail like a woman who raised a city to be tidy and is deciding if it needs to be shamed publicly or bribed with cake. The cat finds the yew Mr. Rook stood under yesterday and leaves a pawprint the exact size of a coin on its root.\n\n\u201cYou fed him,\u201d she says without looking at me, which is both a complaint and an absolution.\n\n\u201cHe came hungry,\u201d I say. \u201cThe worst kind. The kind that knows names.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeach her seven,\u201d Nan says, nodding to the Cathedral visible as a posture at the top of the hill even at dusk. \u201cTeach him nothing. Teach the inspector that being reasonable and being right are cousins that don\u2019t always speak at weddings. Teach Evie that she can close the door before he puts his foot in. Teach the boy on the bridge the words for enough. Then you may sit down and I will tell you a story about a number that was not allowed in a house and lived in the shed until it grew teeth and married the daughter.\u201d\n\nI walk home with my hands colder than they ought to be considering the hour and the kindness of the bread in my pocket. I go by the Roman gate because it likes to be called goodnight and says unkind things otherwise that make people think their shoes are at fault. In the alley behind the library I see a man whose shadow has remembered its second self too completely and the second self has begun to be bored. I cross the street because I am not an idiot and narrow my body to pass between certainty and doubt without letting either ask for my name. At my door the key does me the courtesy of not trying to be a riddle. Inside, the house remembers it is made of corners and hides its relief in the way kitchens keep secrets.\n\nThe feather in its blue ring is where I left it. The gold fleck winks like a friend from a crowded table. On the sill the coin sits on its good face and is not colder than it should be, so no one who doesn\u2019t belong walked by while my back was turned. The jam saucer is a chart of a sea we won\u2019t have to cross if we are polite to the river. In my mouth the taste is sugar and bell and a little of the iron you always keep when you have spoken honestly to a church. I will sleep, not because I deserve it, but because the city is better when I do, and the only compliment I know how to pay her is to put my head down and make room for ordinary things to get on with their work. The bus breathes. The kettle, unwatched, boils and forgives me for it. Somewhere above the street a chimney discovers it has learned a new job and is pleased as anything and no one will ever thank it and it does not mind.",
