     "novel_text": "The first time she refused to step onto a plane, the gate agent smiled at her like she was a child refusing peas and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve done this before, Ms. Keane. San Antonio last spring? You were a dream.\u201d But it was March now, the kind that came into Burke with thin rain and a fretful cold wind, and Ivy Keane had been awake since two in the morning listening to her own heart skate and skid in her chest. She had said yes to a family in Austin because she always said yes\u2014you didn\u2019t build a private tutoring practice by doing only the easy things\u2014and she had driven herself to Reagan National and parked on the third level and found it impossible to breathe in the elevator.\n\nHer throat closed like a fist. The hum of the fluorescent lights cut her into pieces.\n\nShe remembered the blonde boy in Austin, a fifth-grader who\u2019d traced the lines of his reading textbook with his finger like a cartographer, the hesitant turn of his lips when a sentence finally made sense, the soft snort he tried to swallow when she told him her grandfather used to keep Shakespeare in the glove compartment of his truck like a talisman. She had promised him they would read Treasure Island next because he thought pirates should get therapy and she had laughed until she cried. She had meant to go back. She had meant to go everywhere.\n\nBut at Gate C23, between a vending machine that offered strange gentle things\u2014coconut water, a protein bar whose ingredients read like a science lesson\u2014and a plastic plant in a beige pot, the world seemed to tilt. The plane at the window grew larger and also farther away. The floor was too low or she was too high. Every tapping foot in the waiting area was a metronome turned up too loud. A woman in a navy blazer called pre-boarding and a young man with a bright neck pillow slung around his shoulders like a floatation device shuffled to the front. Ivy didn\u2019t stand.\n\nShe thought of the 737\u2019s door sealing like a cave. She thought of the air above West Virginia, black and empty. She thought, We are only held up by promises and good manners. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, and then a stranger was at her elbow with a firm palm pressed to her back. No one asked why. Or maybe someone did. She doesn\u2019t remember answers, only her tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth like an old stamp.\n\nThe gate agent\u2019s smile wavered and then collapsed into something blank. \u201cYou sure?\u201d she said, but it was a performance.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Ivy said again, and her chest seemed to seize. \u201cI\u2019ll take a train.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo Austin?\u201d The agent\u2019s eyebrows climbed like cautious spiders.\n\n\u201cThen I can\u2019t go,\u201d Ivy said, and she started to cry in the silliest way, just drops, not the cinematic flood that would have made it worth the trouble.\n\nThey printed her a refund voucher that folded into a brochure about calm breathing and she walked out of the airport on slow feet, past fliers about a community choir and a lost set of keys with a brass duck attached. Outside, the air smelled like damp asphalt and jet fuel, a tender, poison perfume. A plane thundered low overhead and her knees went loose. She made it to her car, rested her forehead against the steering wheel, and thought of every decision she had made. There was a cardinal on the railing in front of her, its red a foolish blot in the gray, its beak opening and closing like a tiny hinge.\n\nBy the time she pulled into her driveway in Burke, the rain had thinned to a mist. Her townhouse had a square brick face and shutters that a previous owner had painted a cheerful, unfashionable green. The front garden had been angry at being neglected for years until the winter before, when she hired Diego from a number scribbled on a postcard at the farmer\u2019s market. He didn\u2019t talk much at first. He turned the soil and in his gloved hands the land looked like cake batter. He planted rosemary by the step because he said everyone should crush their fingers in something fragrant as they go out into the world. Ivy had believed him because she needed to believe in something she could keep alive.\n\nShe texted the family in Austin\u2014her apologies, her mortification, her promise to arrange a colleague to go in her place. She sat on the stairs just inside her front door and listened to the house. The radiator had a small clank that sounded like someone dropping cutlery very far away. There was a letter on the hallway table from her HOA about the spruces that leaned toward the common lawn: a stern little paragraph about encroachment, as if the trees were misbehaving children.\n\nHer phone kept chiming. A friend sent a sympathetic string of hearts and one of those smile faces with a tear. Her sister, Ruth, did not text immediately, which meant a call was coming. Ivy made tea and put her phone on the counter like a volatile reagent. The kettle shrieked. The rosemary by the door let out a breath when she brushed by.\n\nWhen the phone rang, it was the old barn owl sound she\u2019d set ages ago for family. She held the mug to her mouth and burned her upper lip because she couldn\u2019t think, because she wanted to be punished maybe, a little.\n\n\u201cYou missed your flight,\u201d Ruth said. Not hello. Not are you okay. The way some people ask questions the way they break bread, ready to share, it was not how Ruth spoke. She worked in federal procurement and liked things that were antidotes to chaos.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t miss it, I refused it,\u201d Ivy said, a little aggressively, as if it would be better to be the author of her failing.\n\nThere was a silence and then the soft click of Ruth\u2019s jaw over a mint. \u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about you feeling anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a tutor, Ivy. If you can\u2019t get on planes, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have cars,\u201d she said, and knew it was stupid. \u201cWindows. Trains. I can Zoom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hate Zoom. Everyone hates Zoom.\u201d A rustle, perhaps paper. Ivy imagined her sister in her office, even though it was Saturday, because no matter where Ruth was she sat like a person who could sign a form and make a road appear. \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s inconvenient. But plenty of people get nervous and do it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nerves,\u201d Ivy said, though maybe it was. \u201cIt\u2019s like my blood recedes. It\u2019s like I\u2019m a building and the person who pays the electricity bill packed up and left.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Ruth said without humor. \u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cSolve it,\u201d Ivy said, and felt foolishly brave for saying so. When she hung up, the bravery collapsed like a packing box.\n\nShe didn\u2019t leave the house that day. She said she was taking the weekend to \u201ctake stock,\u201d an old lady thing, but it fit. Her father used to use the term for their pantry when he got the notion to be a single parent who cooked two nights in a row. There would be lists. There would be the weighing of soup cans and finding out the milk had gone quietly wrong.\n\nBy Monday, the fear had followed her into strange places. She couldn\u2019t walk under the big billboard on Braddock Road because the metal groaned and she thought of bolts loosening. She couldn\u2019t swallow easily when a commercial for an airline came on between news segments and she had to leave the room during an interview with a pilot who smiled like a toothpaste advertisement and said the word turbulence as if it were a cousin who sometimes drank too much at weddings.\n\nShe tried to tell someone. The someone she chose was not random. It was Jess, who ran the coffee shop on Ox Road with the chalkboards and the slow baristas you forgave for their slowness because their hands were tenderly theatrical with the milk frothing. Jess had been a pianist once and still had the posture. She wore hair that had gone mostly white in a braid down her back like a rope pulled tight, but her mouth was soft. She had been Ivy\u2019s first client when she moved back to Burke from Richmond four years ago. Jess\u2019s son had needed homework hacking and somebody who would sit in a kitchen with eyes that said I can wait until you emerge from your teenage cave and maybe bring you soup. That son had graduated last May and now did something with sustainable soils.\n\n\u201cI froze at the gate,\u201d Ivy said while the espresso machine hissed like a sleeping cat dream. \u201cI was back in the crowd with my little suitcase, looking like a girl in a painting called Woman Who Pretends Nothing Is Wrong.\u201d\n\nJess pulled a shot, glanced up, her eyebrows knitting. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to freeze.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not, though. If I freeze, there\u2019s a dad in a beltway condo who says I\u2019m not worth the invoice and he\u2019s right. There\u2019s a kid in Austin who wondered why I went away and didn\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you apologize. You did. You don\u2019t need to punish yourself forever.\u201d Jess had a way of placing words down like coasters. \u201cYou can also not fly for a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will think I\u2019m dramatic. Ruth thinks I\u2019m being dramatic. She thinks I should just\u2014\u201d Ivy made a movement with her hand like slipping between pages.\n\nJess set the espresso on the counter, wiped the wand, softened her voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t live in her head. Besides, this town\u2013\u201d She gestured at the glass window where the weather had made a watercolor of the parking lot. \u201cI see more astronauts on toddlers\u2019 shirts than I see astronauts. People love flight as an idea. They also think courage is a faucet you turn on when you want. It isn\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s a trickle and you spend your life catching it in teacups.\u201d\n\nIvy wanted to cry. Jess had that effect on people. It was annoying. \u201cWhat if it never comes back?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhat if it does?\u201d Jess said, and moved on to a customer who needed change like he needed absolution.\n\nShe picked up extra local clients to make up the shortfall. Some of them were gentle dentists whose children smelled like bleach and bubblegum and had science fairs looming like comets. Some of them were lawyers who thought of their kids as evidence. The week the Howard girl needed a mock oral presentation and couldn\u2019t stand up without her knees clapping, Ivy sat on the floor with her and whispered until the words eased out. The office smelled like eucalyptus from a diffuser and there were awards on every shelf. Mrs. Howard, who wore boots that cost as much as Ivy\u2019s old Honda, said, \u201cI read there\u2019s a therapist who puts people in virtual reality airplane seats. Very effective.\u201d The tone was something like helpful, something like a dare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of pixels,\u201d Ivy said, trying to make it light.\n\n\u201cI thought you were\u2014\u201d Mrs. Howard did a thing with her head. \u201cYou know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be many things,\u201d Ivy said, and it sounded like a plea. On her way out, she pressed three fingers into a spiky succulent, as if it would offer a blessing.\n\nOn Thursday, Diego came by for the first spring clean. He arrived barefoot inside his work boots, which Ivy only knew because he took them off at the door and you could see his toes wiggle inside the socks before he slid into a pair of garden clogs that looked like a cartoonist\u2019s idea of shoes. He had the particular smell of someone who spent enough time outside that weather clung to him like a faithful pet. He wore a wool hat that had seen better winters and his eyebrows were thick and cheerful. Diego did not ask questions like Jess did and that was also a kindness because those days Ivy was tired of being the main character in her panic.\n\n\u201cYou want me to pull the spruces back?\u201d he said, tapping the letter from the HOA with two fingers as if it were a card he could win with.\n\n\u201cI want you to tell the HOA to come over here and talk to the trees like they\u2019re old men at a deli,\u201d Ivy said, and Diego smiled with half his mouth.\n\nHe worked while she sorted textbooks in her dining room and made stacks that collapsed almost immediately because it turned out she couldn\u2019t remember her own system; she reorganized her reorganizing. It had always been a life built of small useful things: highlighters in three colors, Post-its like flaky pastries, the good kind of binder clips that didn\u2019t bruise the paper. She stacked flashcards like a card dealer. She respected the small engine of a child\u2019s brain. She could find a metaphor for reading comprehension in the way clouds drifted. Up to now the tasks had spooled out in front of her with a steady hum. Today the table looked like she had spilled herself and there were no rags big enough.\n\nDiego knocked on the sliding door with the back of his hand, a polite clunk. He had soil on his cheek like a birthmark. \u201cDo you want to keep the lamb\u2019s ear? It\u2019s mean this winter. They look tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that they feel like tongues,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep a few, maybe. Put the rest in somebody else\u2019s sun.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, then leaned on the door frame. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re trying to convince a mouse to come out of the wall with raisins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the mouse,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cEverything is the wall.\u201d\n\nDiego nodded in that way he had that made you feel as if he had been a therapist in a previous life but that it hadn\u2019t paid as well as fixing fences. He told her a story about a woman who had once asked him to plant only flowers that would bloom at night because she worked the midnight shift and needed beauty when she came home. \u201cSo we did jasmine and the moonflower, and now when you stand in her driveway at ten p.m., it\u2019s like standing in a memory. It\u2019s busy. Good busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you ever fear\u2026anything?\u201d Ivy asked, surprising herself, and Diego took off his hat and rubbed the place where it had pressed a ring.\n\n\u201cSnakes,\u201d he said. \u201cHeights. Love. All the common things.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre snakes common?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this county? Friend, snakes are an inevitability. Love too.\u201d\n\nIvy laughed, and it turned into a hiccup that hurt her chest. In the silence that followed, a plane bumbled across the sky and her hands started their familiar cold. She didn\u2019t hide it well. Diego\u2019s gaze flicked to her mouth and then away.\n\n\u201cMy mother won\u2019t go in elevators,\u201d he said, as if to offer a story sturdy enough to carry them both. \u201cShe will if there\u2019s no choice. If she\u2019s late for a test or a job interview. But usually she takes the stairs. She calls it her extra time appointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou pay or you pay. Sometimes you pay in other ways. You are the boss of you, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a bossy sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the oldest of four. My sister tells me what to do like she invented the telling.\u201d\n\nHe went back out to the garden and Ivy stood still until the plane faded like an insult. She exhaled, long and slow like Jess had once shown her, counting in a way that made numbers more like prayer beads than like math. It didn\u2019t cure it. It didn\u2019t vanish. But for a second she did not feel like a building with no lights.\n\nIn the evening, after Diego left and the rosemary held a little rain in its green, she made soup without a recipe. She put in lentils and carrots and most of an onion and a fistful of parsley, and when the pot burped she stirred the bottom to make sure nothing stuck. She ate standing at the window, watching a man walk his dog past the spruces, the leash glittering with rain. She thought of burning bridges and building bridges and the drama of both. She thought of the first student who hired her on her own, a thirteen-year-old who\u2019d found her website and sent a message that read, \u201cI would like to learn how to not look dumb,\u201d and Ivy had written back, \u201cYou already know. It\u2019s not a class.\u201d The girl had what Ivy had, a nervous system that thought it was smarter than the rest of the body. But they had coaxed it. They had coaxed it with ridiculous jokes and easy wins and occasionally a good cry and now that girl was applying to film school in Chicago, a city Ivy used to go to often. She pictured their map of the United States, all threads and pins. All those places that now seemed unreachable.\n\nThe news blared, a man in a tie telling a story about weather as if it were politics, and then there was footage of a plane promising cheap fares, a holiday somewhere with water so blue it hurt the eye. She turned the television off. She locked the doors even though Burke had the kind of crime that happened in meetings and left quietly, polite as a dentist. She fell asleep with her hand on her stomach and dreamed she was on a ferry. This was an improvement.\n\nIn the morning the world was swollen and sarcastically bright. Burke had a way of being pretty when it wanted to apologize for being itself. The sky wore swaths of blue, and the trees were still gaunt but domesticated. On such a morning one might be forgiven for believing in resilience like a coupon you could redeem.\n\nShe taught a session in a pewter farmhouse in Clifton with a girl who wanted to fall in love with fractions, who said, \u201cThey seem petty,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cThey are petty, so be more petty,\u201d and by the end the girl\u2019s eyes were lit with the cheap warm flame of competence. On the way home she heard a radio caller talk about his fear of driving on bridges, and she found herself saying yes, yes, yes out loud as if he could hear her like a friend in a balcony. She stopped at a market for oranges because she had an orange craving that felt like a religious calling and ran into Mark.\n\nMark had been the kind of person you dated for six months and then broke up with because he wanted to have opinions in your house. He wore a tie with tiny bikes on it. He sold life insurance and what else could you say. He was not unkind. He was a collector of cleverness like a magpie, and he had looked at Ivy sometimes like she was a piece of furniture he thought would be better against that wall, no that wall, never content with where her life pointed. Still, his eyes crinkled at her now in a way that made her feel seen in a soft way that didn\u2019t demand anything.\n\n\u201cIvy!\u201d He squeezed oranges like interrogation. \u201cI heard you\u2019re not flying. That\u2019s a thing now? With you?\u201d\n\nShe blinked. \u201cWith me,\u201d she agreed. She didn\u2019t ask how he\u2019d heard, because Burke is a sieve dressed as a jug.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it,\u201d he said, like you\u2019d get over a cold. \u201cEverybody gets jumpy sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI might not get over it.\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, amused. \u201cWell, you\u2019re too smart to let your lizard brain run the show. Come on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think my lizard brain is smarter than I am,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has had millions of years of practice. I have had, what, thirty-four?\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me when you need a ride to the airport.\u201d\n\nHe walked away and she felt, as she sometimes did, the old tug to defend herself to no one, the imaginary jury that spent the day in her kitchen, drinking coffee, wondering if she was doing it right. She bought the oranges and a small jar of honey because Diego had once said the local stuff burned the throat like a cure. On her way out, Mrs. Dalloway\u2014no, Mrs. Dalrymple, the older neighbor who wore lipstick like she was competing with autumn\u2014caught her by the sleeve and said, \u201cChurch is this Sunday. People are talking about the Easter brunch signups. You can make something right?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeviled eggs,\u201d Ivy said, and forgot that she didn\u2019t go to that church, had gone twice because the music was good and then they'd asked for her soul in twelve installments.\n\nBack home, Diego\u2019s truck was in front of her house, his ladder lopsided on the grass. He was standing with his palms on his hips, looking at the spruces like a chess player looks at an opponent who is both impossible and elegant. Beside him was a man Ivy had seen before and never met. He wore a bright orange vest over a hoodie and had a clipboard, so you knew his power came from paper.\n\n\u201cWe need these cut back today,\u201d the man said when she came up, waving the letter like a flag of truce at a battle no one had agreed to fight. \u201cEncroachment is serious. The lawn is common. The spruces are not. This is how we end up with litigation over broken bones and teenagers hiding behind trees doing things they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDiego glanced at her like, Do you want me to talk?\n\nShe stood a little straighter. \u201cThey\u2019ve been leaning since Reagan. They\u2019re not threatening anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cRules are rules,\u201d the man said, and his mouth curled in a way that suggested he liked how he sounded. His name tag said KYLE, in letters so self-satisfied it seemed a joke.\n\n\u201cI can trim them,\u201d Diego said. \u201cTomorrow morning. I need to get different rods, big saw. If we cut them willy-nilly they will\u2026die ugly.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d Kyle repeated, and made some notes. \u201cWe\u2019ve had complaints.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom who?\u201d Ivy said.\n\nHe gestured toward a row of townhouses, toward a woman whose blinds fluttered. \u201cFrom those who own eyes,\u201d he said, as if that was a bit of original wit. When he left, his pen clicked like a tick.\n\nDiego laughed when the man was gone, short and sharp. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it right. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay extra,\u201d Ivy said.\n\n\u201cYou already pay honest. I want to sleep. I don\u2019t sleep if I kill a tree by impatience.\u201d\n\nTo distract herself from picturing the spruces hacked and helpless, she cleaned her bookshelf in the front room, pulled books that felt tired in her hands, listed them for donation. There was an old battered edition of Anne of Green Gables she\u2019d found at a yard sale in Ashburn with a note inside from a girl to her future, written in purple pen with hearts. There was a book of Neruda poems in Spanish she could not read but sometimes pretended to by mouthing the sounds. There were five copies of the same teaching manual because she kept thinking she\u2019d lost it, then found it in a different tote bag. The domestic economy of a tutor is a mess of bags. She found a folded plane ticket stub from nine months before\u2014Chicago, gate B11\u2014and her stomach did a backflip like an amateur gymnast.\n\nShe was on the floor with paperbacks like a fort when the doorbell rang. It was a thin, precise sound, an instrument out of tune. She opened the door to a girl of about ten with hair that had not decided what it wanted to be and cheeks that could carry a lot of joy without breaking. She had a flyer in her hand for a school play and she said, \u201cDo you want to sponsor?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Ivy said, kneeling to the girl\u2019s eye level as if they might exchange secrets.\n\n\u201cLike, give money so we can rent the lights,\u201d the girl said. \u201cOr give us a basket. My mom said to say that. Sponsor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love lights,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cHow much?\u201d\n\nThe girl named a number and Ivy thought about oranges and plane tickets and the way she would not be going to Austin, and said yes. The girl\u2019s smile tilted the world. On the flyer the school\u2019s mascot\u2014a hawk with generous eyelashes\u2014looked like it could audition for television. The play was Peter Pan.\n\n\u201cSo much flying,\u201d Ivy said without meaning to, and the girl squinted as if looking at something far away. \u201cWe have harnesses,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that high. Also Mr. Turner says the spirit of flying is in your heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he,\u201d Ivy said.\n\nHe was right, and also wrong.\n\nThat night Ivy went to Jess\u2019s to pick up a pie she had foolishly promised to bring to Ruth\u2019s house for Sunday dinner because saying yes to pastry is easier than saying yes to courage. The coffee shop after dark felt like a backstage, all the instruments picked up and put to bed. Jess had a dish towel thrown over her shoulder like a truce flag and flour on her cheek that looked like a smear of chalk. She handed over a lemon chess pie with warnings: don\u2019t jiggle it too much, it will be a little ugly at the edges because that means it\u2019s true, sugar does not need help doing what it does to you.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s the mouse?\u201d Jess said without preamble.\n\n\u201cIt comes out for raisins,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cBut it also steals the raisins from me while I\u2019m asleep.\u201d\n\nJess leaned on her elbows. Her eyes were blue like old denim. \u201cMaybe stop telling people you\u2019re dramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like a preemptive strike,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cBefore they get the chance.\u201d\n\nJess\u2019s mouth did a little sideways thing. \u201cOr an invitation for them to be careless.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met a man with a clipboard today.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiego is going to cut the spruces tomorrow. He won\u2019t kill them. He is precise. He loves the lamb\u2019s ear like it\u2019s a child.\u201d\n\nJess laughed. \u201cHe is\u2026what my mother would have called a serious person. Not solemn. But serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo serious people break?\u201d Ivy asked. \u201cIf we push them?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone breaks.\u201d Jess took the towel off her shoulder, folded it like a flag. \u201cBut some of us call it a hinge.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, she took the lemon chess pie to Ruth\u2019s and sat at a sturdy table that had seen more homework than confession. Ruth\u2019s husband, Doug, had a laugh like a grill lighting. Her nieces wore shirts with glitter words. On the walls were framed photos of them in complicated cheerleading stunts that made Ivy\u2019s stomach flip and also made her proud in a generalized aunt way. People who had never fallen like to fly. People who had. Both kinds ended up in frames.\n\nRuth waited until the roast chicken was on the table and the potatoes were passed around like currency and then she said, \u201cI thought about it and I think you should talk to someone. About the plane thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am talking to someone,\u201d Ivy said, hooking Jess and Diego and the ten-year-old girl with the flyer into the definition of someone. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, though,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about your little breakdown at the gate. It\u2019s about sustainability. You can\u2019t sustain this if you\u2019re losing clients.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always do the company presentation voice when you\u2019re trying to love me,\u201d Ivy said gently because she wanted to love her back without letting the voice in. \u201cI want help. I don\u2019t want a brief.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be\u2026practical.\u201d\n\nDoug watched them like he always did, like a golden retriever deciding whether to jump on the couch. He finally said, \u201cFear is probably trying to keep you alive. Also it\u2019s probably overdoing it. You can have both.\u201d\n\nIvy smiled at him like a medal. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.\n\nHer nieces asked about boys and about the ROI on college in a way that made Ivy\u2019s throat hurt because they\u2019d learned it somewhere, that acronym, like a prayer. She wanted to put fresh snow over their acronyms and make new tracks. Ruth brought out the pie at the end and said, \u201cDid you bake?\u201d with a tone that made Ivy say, \u201cI did,\u201d even though Jess had. The pie cracked on the top like a drought and there was powdered sugar that made a soft dust that got on everything. They ate it with small forks that had been their mother\u2019s in another life, nickel-silver and a little bent.\n\nOn the way home, Ivy drove the long way through the old part of Burke where the houses still had porches that were not for show. She rolled the windows down in spite of the cold. Somewhere a radio played an old song about flying, which was not helpful. She turned the knob and the song went to unhelpful static. She thought of the photo in Ruth\u2019s hall of the two of them at the Virginia State Fair when they were fifteen and nineteen; there was cotton candy, there were sunburned shoulders, there was the long ago boy who had wanted to kiss Ivy in the Ferris wheel and she\u2019d said no because heights. Always heights. In the story she tells now to girls who want to be brave she is indignant about it. Why should anyone be brave on someone else\u2019s schedule? But at nineteen, the world had no slot for indignation. Just yes or no, ride or get off.\n\nWhen she reached her house, there was a note stuck in the door with blue painter\u2019s tape. The handwriting was blocky, determined. It was Diego\u2019s. It said: I cut a branch then stopped. Something is wrong with the one over the sidewalk. It\u2019s cracked inside. Bigger than I can handle with one ladder. Don\u2019t walk under it if you can help it. Tomorrow morning I bring help.\n\nShe pictured the branch like a bone inside the tree, a fracture you couldn\u2019t see until you pressed. She thought of the way some things held until they didn\u2019t. She thought: I will not learn everything today.\n\nShe slept surprisingly well. Maybe because of the pie. Maybe because if you are told not to walk under a branch you can do that. The rules are specific and the body likes a specific.\n\nAt seven, Diego was there with a man named Oscar and a tangle of ropes that looked like a sea creature. He had a harness like climbers wear and a new hat that must be his working hat because it had a narrow brim that made him look serious in a way you would not laugh at. Ivy made coffee and brought it out and tried not to hover while they arranged their tools as if they were setting a table in a dream where the dessert forks were carabiners.\n\n\u201cGoing to be a tense morning,\u201d Diego said with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll buy me a beer later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t drink,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI like the idea of beer,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cCoffee is my beer.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask him how a gardener figured out which branches were dangerous; trust made that question quiet. Oscar went up the ladder with the slow patience of someone talking a friend down from a ledge. Diego spotted him with a hand on his ankle when the ladder shifted. There were a few neighbors peeking through blinds or pretending to check their mail. Burke watched each other in ways that mostly meant well and sometimes didn\u2019t. Ivy held the coiled extension cord like a dog leash that led nowhere.\n\nKyle arrived with his clipboard thirty minutes in, of course he did. He had that smell of a man who has never sweated for anything but sports. He stood just inside the property line and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll want to angle that cut,\u201d at a volume that suggested he hoped to be mistaken for a person in charge.\n\n\u201cWe know,\u201d Diego said without looking down.\n\nKyle stepped closer, too close, feet under the locus of the tree, the branch that groaned very softly. \u201cSeriously, you don\u2019t want it to split. Then we\u2019ve got a mess. Liability. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack up,\u201d Diego said, suddenly loud. \u201cSir, move. Not under.\u201d Oscar paused, saw what Diego saw, froze.\n\nKyle laughed. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI know trees. My grandfather had an orchard.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d Diego said, not cool at all. \u201cBack.\u201d\n\nIt happened in less than a breath. The sound was a rip, like cloth but deeper, as if the day itself had been torn. The branch\u2014that hidden failure\u2014gave. One end swung toward the sidewalk, gathering speed that shamed the word swing. Diego moved then like a person whose body had signed a contract. He shoved Kyle hard, both hands, not a suggestion, a demand. Kyle stumbled, pinwheeled, tripped over the curb, went down with his leg twisted beneath him and there was a sound that made Ivy\u2019s mouth fill with spit, the body\u2019s idiot compassion.\n\nThe branch slammed into the place where Kyle had been. It hit the pavement and cracked into two, a neat cloven thing. The ladder juddered but Oscar had an arm around the trunk already, legs knotted into the bark, eyes wide and very alive.\n\nThen there was the after. The quiet that pretended the noise hadn\u2019t happened. Then the shouting. Kyle screaming and then saying, \u201cIt\u2019s my leg, my leg,\u201d as if he could negotiate with it. Diego, soft again, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t try to stand,\u201d his hands near but not touching. Ivy, already on the phone with 911, her voice oddly calm, trying out the sentences for size: There was an accident. The branch\u2014yes, he\u2019s breathing. Yes, conscious.\n\nNeighbors came like ghosts in day clothes. Jess appeared at the curb with half her apron still on, because news in a small town beat the posted hours. She knelt at Kyle\u2019s head and held her hand just above his forehead and said, \u201cBreathe the way you breathe when you want to sleep,\u201d and someone brought a blanket; there is always a blanket.\n\nThe ambulance took too long, as ambulances will when you stand next to a broken thing and all you can do is be human, and that is an insult you take a long time to forgive. When they finally came and wrapped the leg in something that made it look like a promise instead of a limb, Diego stood back, shook his hands once like a dog does after rain. He looked more rattled than he allowed. He was the color of paper.\n\n\u201cYou saved his head,\u201d Jess said. \u201cYou put his head where the branch wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDiego shrugged. His eyes tracked the broken limb of the tree without affection but with respect. \u201cIt\u2019s always the head,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the trouble sets up a tent.\u201d\n\nKyle, pale and grim and transformed into a person you\u2019d give soup to, reached for Diego\u2019s sleeve. \u201cYou pushed me,\u201d he said, incredulous, as if the concept of humane physics had never occurred to him.\n\nDiego leaned in so their eyes were level. \u201cI pushed you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll send me the complaint later.\u201d\n\nKyle laughed in a way that was half sob. It made Ivy like him almost. The EMT looked at Diego and said, \u201cYou did good,\u201d which is a sentence that can last you a few days if you ration it.\n\nBy noon there were texts on Ivy\u2019s phone from numbers she didn\u2019t know. A neighbor had posted on the community board, the social media\u2019s tidy yard with its passive-aggressive herb garden, about the branch and the pushing and the saving. Someone wrote hero. Someone wrote liability. Someone wrote I told you those spruces. The internet is a potluck that always runs out of the good salads.\n\nDiego came in and washed his hands at her kitchen sink for a long time, quiet and methodical. He scrubbed soil from under his nails with the small brush Ivy kept for that purpose and had actually never used. The water ran brown then clear. He dried his hands on a towel with lemons on it, making the lemons damp and less happy. Ivy watched him for a second and then reached out, pressed her palm to his forearm just above the wrist. It was not the kind of thing she did. But the body calls sometimes.\n\n\u201cI have beer,\u201d she said, and he laughed in relief.\n\nShe poured two glasses of apple cider instead, because beer was an idea and cider was liquid apple, and they sat at her table and looked at the slice of tree that had fallen and now lay in the yard like a whale bone. \u201cYou saved him,\u201d she said, not because he didn\u2019t know, but because the sentence wanted to be said by someone other than an EMT.\n\n\u201cI broke his leg,\u201d Diego said. He examined the rim of his glass as if the answer were written there.\n\n\u201cYou saved his head,\u201d she repeated, and he let that sentence sit between them. You could see him weigh it like a stone in his palm, not entirely convinced it was the right weight but grateful.\n\nOutside, Oscar finished the job with the art of someone who had done hard things and felt that doing them right was either the penance or the prize; he trimmed the tear clean, made a wound that could heal.\n\nJess texted a heart and a bagel emoji, because in this town bagels have replaced casseroles as the love gift. Ruth called and said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d in a voice that sounded like a road built quickly and well. Ivy said, \u201cI am,\u201d and found that she was and then found that she wasn\u2019t and then that she was again. It was not a permanent condition. She imagined standing at a gate, a plane at the window. The old panic rose and she watched it, the way you watch a cat in your yard. It did its elegant, cruel little dance. It would not be coaxed. She did not coax. She let it be a weather. She opened her palm on the table. Her life was the same size as it had been yesterday. The branch had broken. The leg had broken. Something else had been saved and maybe that was hers too.\n\nIn the afternoon, her email dinged with a message from a woman who ran a foundation for kids in the county who needed tutoring and whose families could not pay. Somebody on the community board had tagged her in a thread about Ivy being reliable and kind even in emergencies, which is not a thing you put on your website because you don\u2019t think to. The foundation had a grant. They needed someone to coordinate summer sessions at the library. Work not far. Work with a roof like a quiet ship. Work that did not require a plane.\n\nShe read the email twice, three times, like decoding a foreign tongue. Outside, the cut on the tree shone and glistened raw and noble, and the whole neighborhood felt long and thin and newly connected, as if a line had been drawn between her front steps and a dozen people who wanted to say: we saw that. We will think better of you, not worse, because of what you fear and what you did anyway, which was neither fly nor run away, but stand and hold a phone and call and not panic even when something in your skin panicked.\n\nShe could still hear Kyle\u2019s laugh that had the sob in it. She could still hear the branch, that deep rip. She got up from the table, slid the dining room chair in like the end of a chapter, and went to the front yard. The air had more gold in it now. She stood in front of the spruces and lifted her hands and breathed the way you breathe when you want to sleep. The trees did not know her. They held. They rustled like polite older men who had decided to forgive you for something you had not done. The house next door smelled like someone was making cinnamon toast. A bus far off coughed. It would rain again in a few days; this was the truce.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said to no one and to the world. \u201cOkay.\u201d She said it again because sometimes you need a second okay to make the first one real.\n\nTomorrow there would be insurance forms and maybe a stern letter and maybe a thank-you card and possibly a new job that involved the smell of library books and the quiet rumble of people trying. Tomorrow she would still not be able to step onto a plane and the sky would not care and the robin on the fence would shake its slick head and live its tiny life with competence. Sometimes the not-caring of the sky was relief. Sometimes it was an insult. Today, she let it be relief.\n\nWhen she went inside, she wrote to the foundation yes, with a careful delight that felt like dipping a ladle. She called the Austin family and made a plan to have her colleague Liam go in her place, to stand in the kitchen with the pirate boy, to say, \u201cThe therapist the pirates get, what do you think he would say?\u201d She cut an orange in the sink and ate it over the drain like a student in a hurry, the juice running down her wrist. A flake of powdered sugar from the pie fell on the counter where it had no right to still be. She licked it off her finger and laughed, the small imperfect laugh of a person who has begun, by inches, to forgive herself for being herself.\n\nAt dusk there was a knock on her door. Not a doorbell, a knock, polite but urgent. She opened it to find Kyle, on crutches, a hospital boot swallowing his shin, a paper wristband still on like a club bracelet. His face was the color of cooked pasta, his mouth amateur with thanks.\n\n\u201cI brought this,\u201d he said, and held up a potted plant. It was a fern. The kind that did not forgive rough words. He had tied a ribbon to it, haphazardly and also earnestly. There was a card stuffed in its fronds.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d she said, flustered, because what do you say to a man whose leg you have not broken and who also nearly had his skull split in your yard.\n\n\u201cThe Vicodin is working too,\u201d he said with a little chortle that wanted to be a man giggle. \u201cI wanted to say. You saved my life. Or he did. But it was your...thing, your people, your property, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He squinted at his own flailing sentence. \u201cI am a pain in the ass. I am a rules person. I will still be. But I will also...not be. A bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said because what else. \u201cDo you want to sit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll fall asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to say it out loud. Thank you. Don\u2019t tell anybody I said so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she lied kindly, because she would tell Jess and Diego and the spruces if she could. She would tell the girl who brought the flyer that sometimes the flying doesn\u2019t look like a harness. The garden behind him breathed. Burke breathed, the tight breath of suburbs easing, just a bit, in the low light. Ivy watched him swing himself back down the steps, careful, careful, and had the sudden, impossible thought: I am not a problem to solve. I am a person to tend. It felt like a true thing and that felt like a miracle.\n\nThe night came on like a lake, and overhead a plane blinked its small impolite lights across the dark. Ivy watched it go. It did not make her heart stampede. It made her imagine the people inside, their knees, the baby bored with the miracle, the woman who put on lip balm before landing, the old man who couldn\u2019t hear the captain. People in a tube hurtling, alive together. She waved at them with two fingers, a rude little salute from the ground. She did not wish herself there. She did not wish herself anywhere else. For once, the ground was exactly the right distance from her feet. She went inside and wrote a list on a yellow pad: call library. call Liam. orange juice. return Mrs. Dalrymple\u2019s pie tin. tell Jess: teacups. \n\nThe pen stuttered once and kept going. She placed the list under a magnet on the fridge shaped like a cow wearing glossy boots\u2014why had she chosen that, when?\u2014and smiled at it. The house shifted imperceptibly, trying to find its balance, and she shifted with it, and found hers.In the week after the branch, the cut on the spruce dried into something dignified and deliberate, pale as bone, and Ivy felt that she could walk under it without making bargains in her head. She told herself she would not be the sort of person who visited a wound daily, but she found excuses to go to the mailbox, to check the rosemary, to look for the cardinal that had taken to scolding the world from the gutter of her roof. Diego came back twice to check the sealant he\u2019d brushed on the exposed wood, once with a bucket of compost he called black gold and once with a coil of rope over his shoulder because he said someone had asked him to move a hammock, as if hammocks were wild animals that needed coaxing. He refused money for the extra trips. He took two oranges from the bowl on her counter with the reverence of a thief who wants to be caught and thanked.\n\nThe email from the foundation turned into a meeting on a Thursday morning at the county library, a building that made its arguments in glass and beige carpet and a smell like paper that had been rained on and then dried in a hurry. The woman who had written, whose name turned out to be Maritza, wore earrings like commas and had a laugh that could cut a ribbon. She shook Ivy\u2019s hand as if this were a trade in respect. Behind her desk there was a calendar with watercolor pictures of national parks and a mug that read, Ask me about my holds.\n\n\u201cWe do summer learning every year,\u201d Maritza said, tapping a stack of folders with a pen whose cap had been worried to death. \u201cIt\u2019s usually good-natured chaos. We try to make it less chaos, more good. This year we have the grant for more hours, more tutors. I have a list of kids from the counselors who need extra eyes and extra patience. You look like you have both.\u201d\n\nIvy spooked slightly at the compliment and then folded herself neatly around it. \u201cI have a lot of Post-its,\u201d she said. \u201cI have metaphors like stray cats. And I can be here. I like this room.\u201d She gestured at the study tables like ships anchored in a safe harbor, at the bulletin board where someone with neat block letters had made a display of \u201cBooks with Bridges.\u201d\n\nMaritza inclined her head. \u201cI like anybody who likes the room.\u201d She spread out a crude map of the summer with boxes for weeks. There were themes penciled in, half committed and half shy: Maps and Journeys, Food Stories, Birds, Not Flying. Maritza\u2019s eyebrows hopped. \u201cThat last one is a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cA librarian joke. We\u2019ll find a better word. Maybe Migration. Maybe We Move.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe Staying,\u201d Ivy said, and then shook her head because it sounded defensive and she did not want her summer to carry her refusal like a banner. \u201cMaybe We Move and We Stay. Maybe how to be somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth is my favorite,\u201d Maritza said. \u201cMy mother emigrated twice and then decided her true homeland was the grocery store with the tortillas and the good mangoes. We can make a poster say that.\u201d She flipped a page. \u201cWe also have volunteers. Teens mostly. A boy who will make better spreadsheets than I do. A girl who will refuse to shelve romance novels unless you remind her that librarians do not get to be snobs. You\u2019ll like them. They bring snacks.\u201d\n\nThey walked the space. The children\u2019s section had a carpet with roads printed on it as if whoever designed it had wanted to make a point about following lines. A toddler lay on his belly in the middle of an intersection, rolling a car with an intensity that made him look like a tiny mechanic. In a corner there was a fixture where bird puppets lived on sticks like dignified old professors waiting for appointments. Ivy ran a finger over the wing of a cardinal with felt that had lost its nap. She felt like someone who had stumbled into her job rather than someone who had applied for it. But the joy in her throat was not a stumble. She could build a summer of small, useful things. She could make a way to learn that did not require planes.\n\nOn the drive home she passed the sports fields by the middle school where a line of cheerleaders in practice T-shirts did stunts that made the air itself seem rubbery. The sight would have ordinarily made her stomach tip, but she gripped the wheel lightly and imagined she was holding the car in conversation rather than in fear. She told herself there would be a time to try and there would be a time to be proud of not trying. She was getting better at telling the difference. She called Liam from a red light and left a message that was more gratitude than instruction. He texted back a photo of the blonde boy in Austin with Treasure Island on the counter next to a bowl of cereal that looked like a collection of small moons.\n\nHe\u2019d written, in block letters on a Post-it stuck to the book, The pirates are in group work. The R in pirates was a little wounded, leaning to the left. Ivy put the phone in her lap and let herself be both happy and crestfallen, a trick she was startlingly bad at and wanted to get better at. She sent back a heart and a stupid GIF of a parrot doing a power stance and then, because it felt like confession, she added: Tell him I am learning the ferry.\n\nJess called to ask if Ivy could pick up milk on her way, the whole milk in the glass bottle because the espresso machine had developed a taste for drama. Ivy swung by the small grocery where Mark had squeezed oranges and this time she didn\u2019t run into anyone she\u2019d dated, which felt like luck or a lesson. The cashier had purple hair that was beginning to recede at the temples, bravely, and had the courtesy to ask no questions about how someone could leave with only bottles and a banana. Jess\u2019s bell chimed when she pushed the door and the sound hit her in the sternum like a knock from a friendly ghost. The morning had draped itself over the shop in light like a shawl. The chalkboard had a drawing of a frog with a crown and the phrase Kiss at your own risk scrawled in a high schooler\u2019s confident cursive.\n\n\u201cMy machine is sulking,\u201d Jess said, wiping the bar with a rag that had died heroically long ago. \u201cI named her after an opera singer. I regret it. She is living up to it.\u201d\n\nIvy set the milk down with a thunk that felt ritualistic. \u201cYou want me to talk to her?\u201d she said. \u201cTell her about accountability?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do it when I close for an hour and all the men who think they want cortados are at lunch pretending they like arugula.\u201d Jess\u2019s hair was braided today with a ribbon that looked like it had been stolen from a present. She leaned her hip against the counter. \u201cHow\u2019s the library?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a ship. Like a Lego kit that\u2019s missing one weird brick and you have to engineer your way around it and the solution is better anyway.\u201d\n\nJess\u2019s face opened the way it did when Ivy said something that sounded like poetry by accident. \u201cYou like the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the room.\u201d Ivy felt brave enough to say it twice. \u201cThey want me to name weeks. We Move. We Stay. We Eat Oranges and Call It Science.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should do a week where you show kids how to name their own weeks,\u201d Jess said. \u201cGive them a calendar and rib their months like a roast chicken. What week saved you? What week made you want to lie down in the produce section and weep at the sight of grapes?\u201d\n\n\u201cA menu of redemption,\u201d Ivy said, and Jess laughed into her wrist like she was sipping the laugh.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the farmer\u2019s market in the parking lot of the church was a handful of bright tents like handkerchiefs. Diego\u2019s table was there for the first time in months because the frost had finally loosened its grip and things were becoming themselves again. He had flats of seedlings with names written in tidy rows on popsicle sticks: basil, chard, zinnia, black-eyed Susan. Children made a small queue to touch the lamb\u2019s ear, people who had known softness and wanted to make sure they still did. Diego had a cardboard sign that read Feel this one and a stack of pamphlets about native plants with photocopies that made the photographs look haunted.\n\n\u201cYou are becoming an entrepreneur,\u201d Ivy said, presenting herself at the corner of his tent like a regular.\n\n\u201cI am becoming a person who can leave a pamphlet and charge five dollars for a plant and both things are true,\u201d he said. He wore a shirt with paint on it in a pattern that looked like a map of islands. He handed her a small pot of something she did not recognize and she held it the way you hold a small bird that has allowed itself to be caught.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cA foxglove,\u201d he said. \u201cPoisonous if you devour it. Beautiful if you don\u2019t. Like everything.\u201d\n\nShe frowned. \u201cIs this a metaphor I need today?\u201d\n\nDiego shrugged with his eyebrows, which was a skill she envied. \u201cIt is a bell you can ignore if you have no need to ring it.\u201d\n\nJess appeared with a broom she did not need to be carrying because she did not sweep the outside world, and leaned it against her shoulder like a spear. \u201cI came to see you two in the wild,\u201d she announced. \u201cAnd to buy a jar of honey from Mrs. Pomfret because she wears a beekeeper hat like a crown and I would like to feel like that when I pour sweetness onto things.\u201d\n\nThey meandered for an hour in the soft sun and bought lettuce with dirt clinging to it like loyalty, a loaf of bread with a crust that looked like a geological feature, a bunch of radishes that had the kind of pink that makes you forgive worse pinks. A man with a clipboard\u2014different clipboards existed, Ivy had to remember\u2014was collecting signatures for a petition to prevent the removal of a footbridge in the park that had been declared unfit. He said \u201cinfrastructure\u201d as if he felt it in his molars. Ivy signed because she liked bridges even when they frightened her. When they walked away she considered that loving something you feared was a complicated religion and felt a bit proud to be a congregant.\n\nThe play the little girl had advertised the week before was on a Friday night and Ivy almost forgot it until she found the flyer under a stack of mail by the door where things went to become ancient. She went because she had given money for lights and you cannot buy light and then ignore where it shines. The gymnasium had been transformed into a theater using conviction and black curtains. Parents found seats the way people find their places at weddings, jockeying without meanness. The hawk mascot made an appearance before the show to remind everyone not to stand on the bleachers and to turn off their phones and it was so earnest about it that people actually did.\n\nWhen Peter flew, it was four feet off the ground and the harness creaked and the stagehand who pulled the rope wore a tiara. It was beautiful. Ivy cried a little in the secretive way of public criers, looking down and pretending to adjust her program. The girl from her porch was Wendy and did a bow at the end that was so proud and so shy at once that Ivy felt a desire to protect every child in the world like a flood that washed nothing away. Afterward she stood awkwardly in the lobby with the table of bake sale items and told the girl she had been brave and the girl said, \u201cYeah, but the boy who played Michael got stuck in the wires and didn\u2019t cry and saved his own life,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cThat\u2019s a fine thing to know how to do.\u201d\n\nRuth texted from a conference room downtown a picture of a bowl of pillowy gnocchi she would never eat because she had a sudden call and three men waiting for a document. Ivy sent back a photo of the stage with the rope and wrote: Controlled flight. Ruth replied with a plane emoji and a heart and Ivy had the startling thought that they were raising each other, still, in the small hours between responsibility and sleep.\n\nOn a Monday, when the sun had decided to take a personal day, Ivy took herself to the VRE station and bought a ticket to Alexandria with the zeal of someone making an unambiguous gesture toward the future. It wasn\u2019t a ferry, but it was at least a machine that carried people with a timetable and a promise and she wanted to teach her body not to revolt at the first sign of forward motion that wasn\u2019t her hands on a wheel. The platform smelled like wet newspapers and somebody\u2019s lemon hand lotion. A man in a blazer did a crossword holding the paper at a slant only he understood. Ivy sat on a bench and watched a boy jump from square to square as if the nonexistent cracks could undo him. The train came shouldering into the station with a confidence that made her want to applaud. She got on without announcing it to anyone but her shoes. She sat by the window and did not tell herself stories that had unhappy endings. Across from her a woman in scrubs slept with her mouth slightly open, her wrist bristling with hair ties, an exhausted queen returning from a battlefield of flus.\n\nThe trip was only twenty-eight minutes, almost laughably brief, but it was a sentence she could say to Ruth later without bracing. In Alexandria she stood on the platform under a sky that thought about raining and considered immediately getting back on the return train to make the experience symmetrical. Instead she walked to a bakery that sold croissants like layered promises and ate one still steaming on the inside and felt the laminations of her courage flop into place, not perfect, but there. She texted Jess a photo and wrote Teacups in the caption because Jess had once told her that courage was a trickle and you had to catch it in small dishes. Jess replied with a picture of three ceramic cups with little handles like ears that someone had made at the art center with such irregular tenderness that they made Ivy want to be nice to every maker.\n\nOn her way home from the station, she passed the Workhouse Arts Center where the old prison had become a village of studios and places where people took classes in glass and clay and the disciplined making of sound. There was a banner for a performance by a string quartet and an exhibit of paper cut into forests so intricate you felt you could walk into them and never find daylight again. She almost turned in. She almost didn\u2019t. She did. It was a small betrayal of her plan and she congratulated herself for it like a villain. In Studio W-7, a woman with hair like a cloud of silver thread was teaching a class of people who looked like accountants on their day off to throw bowls. The woman\u2019s voice was soothing and exacting. She said, \u201cThe clay wants something. Ask it what it wants,\u201d and the students laughed and did what she said anyway.\n\nIvy bought a small mug glazed in a green that made her think of the rosemary after rain and on the bottom it said, in a careful hand, OKAY. She had the sudden, ridiculous sense that the mug had been made for her. She held it to her sternum on the way to the car to keep it from jostling and thought of the night she had stood in her yard and told the air okay twice to make it true. She imagined drinking from it at the library during Maps and Journeys week and seeing that word as she tipped it to her mouth like a permission slip.\n\nThe summer job began in miniature, as all good things should. Ivy sat with Maritza and a boy named Mason who had the energy of a small generator and a girl named Amina who had perfect eyeliner and was incapable of pretending to like a book she didn\u2019t respect. Mason had a key ring with too many keys and which he wore on his belt with a hook that made him look powerful. He said, \u201cThe keys for the supply cabinet are color-coded,\u201d in a way that suggested that he had put in the effort to make it so and wanted the world to reflect that care back at him. Amina leafed through a stack of picture books about maps and said, \u201cIf one more author thinks children want to look at a picture of a compass, I\u2019m going to stage a coup.\u201d Ivy assigned them to make signs and they took to it with the seriousness of sous-chefs, conferring over font choices with the ferocity of litigators.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon a boy named Bryce was sent to Ivy with the note, \u201cHe reads like he\u2019s fighting. Please make it not a war.\u201d Bryce had hair like a single stubborn idea and a watch that told him how much he had moved in the day, which depressed him. He sat down across from her with the vibe of someone who believed in gravity only when it suited him. Ivy asked him what he wanted the room to be called and he said, without looking up from the tabletop, \u201cThe bunker.\u201d She said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and they pretended it was a bunker and when they pretended it he stopped hunching his shoulders so high. She asked him if he wanted to read a book about a kid who had an underground house and he said, \u201cLame,\u201d and she said, \u201cAgree to disagree,\u201d and read the first two pages like she was telling a ghost story. He looked up two paragraphs later with the impatience of someone ready to be interested but determined to make you work for it. By the time the hour was up, he had said, \u201cI guess\u201d three times in a tone that meant yes.\n\nShe told people the truth when she could bear to. When a student asked where she went all the time because her Instagram, which no one looked at, had all these photos of airports from different years, she said, \u201cI went places for work and I might again later, but for now I\u2019m building a different kind of map,\u201d and they blinked and then asked for her to draw a funny dinosaur which was a relief because her dinosaur was always embarrassing and children love adult embarrassment when it is offered without shame.\n\nKyle appeared in her life like weather. She saw him at the end of her block with a clipboard he had not yet figured out how to carry with a crutch, trying to sign his name in the precise box a neighbor had drawn for a package. He waved her over with a finger flick that would have annoyed her in other circumstances and said, \u201cI owe you a form,\u201d as if gratitude boiled down to thick paper. He had not lost his smell of certainty, but it was hushed. He asked her about the spruces with something like tenderness and listened to her answer as if it mattered how a tree healed. When he said, \u201cMy grandmother would slap me if she heard me say this, but thank God I broke my leg and not my head,\u201d he touched his hand to the place above his ear in a gesture that seemed borrowed from someone gentler.\n\nSometimes the fear returned in the loud way, marching down the hall of her body banging cymbals. It happened in the frozen section of the grocery store when a documentary on the small television by the TV dinners showed an airplane wing dutifully flexing; it happened when a summer storm unzipped the sky and the thunder arrived delayed, like guilt. It seemed more manageable when she learned to point at it in her head and say, This is Tuesday fear, which will pass by Thursday, instead of saying, This is my fear forever. She told Jess she was practicing this and Jess said, \u201cTuesday fear is a jerk,\u201d and Ivy fell in love with the sentence as if it were a button she could sew onto the days.\n\nDiego roped her into planting a night garden for the woman who came home at dawn smelling like the hospital\u2019s harsher virtues. The woman\u2019s yard was a postage stamp with a fence that had gone gray under the strain of keeping anything in or out. They dug in the late afternoon when the sun thought better of itself and followed a line Diego had laid out with twine and very small flags stolen from some unknown child\u2019s birthday. He told her stories of the plants like family gossip. The moonflower would be a show-off and you had to love it anyway. The jasmine would be a quiet friend but would try to do too much if you didn\u2019t give it limits. Ivy listened like a parishioner. She pressed her thumb into soil and then into her tongue and tasted iron and days. When they were done, the woman stood in the doorway in scrubs that held onto the day\u2019s sadness and said, \u201cI don\u2019t deserve this,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cYes you do,\u201d with such conviction she startled herself. On the way home, the sky was the color of a bruise with good circulation and the first star went into the job with no fuss.\n\nThe day the espresso machine at Jess\u2019s actually collapsed into melodrama, hissing and coughing like a small dragon that had swallowed dust, Jess closed the shop for an hour and declared a council. Ivy stood with both hands braced on the counter and listened to the symptoms and then did the thing she was good at: she took the complicated thing apart gently, spoke to each piece as if it were a student, and put it back together with one rogue spring correctly humble again. She used a tiny screwdriver she kept in her bag for fixing glasses and a binder clip she had in her pocket because a life like hers demanded that you always be able to hold things together at a moment\u2019s notice. When the machine shuddered back to life, Jess put both hands on Ivy\u2019s cheeks and said, \u201cDo not underestimate what you are for us,\u201d which is the sort of sentence you should only say if you mean it, and Jess meant it so hard it made Ivy need to sit down. She sipped the first shot pulled from the redeemed machine and said, \u201cIt tastes like someone took off their heavy coat,\u201d and Jess said, \u201cYes,\u201d and that was that.\n\nA letter arrived addressed to \u201cMs. Keane: Flight,\u201d which would have been funny if it hadn\u2019t come with a brochure about virtual exposure therapy folded inside. Mrs. Howard, of the boots and the eucalyptus office, had sent it along with a note the size of a business card that said, \u201cIf you like being modern, here is modern.\u201d Ivy put it in a drawer with the old keys and the things that might save her later. She set a calendar reminder to think about it in a month. She was not going to be the kind of person who pretended she didn\u2019t need help just because she had already saved a man\u2019s head indirectly and taken a train. She could both be brave and accept that her courage had staff meetings it needed to attend.\n\nAt night she listened to the planes less. They still crossed the sky like stitched shut mouths. She imagined sometimes what an overhead compartment felt like. She imagined the sound of ice clink in plastic cups. It did not send her heart into the bad gallop as often. Sometimes she lay on her back on the rug like a person organizing her nerves and thought about her grandfather\u2019s Shakespeare in the glove compartment and the way some kinds of bravery rub off on you if you touch the right things often enough. The Word as talisman. The plant as spell. The list on the fridge like a meal plan for a soul.\n\nWhen the first day of Maps and Journeys arrived, the room filled with children who had eaten fruit roll-ups for breakfast and grandmothers who loved hard in lectures. Maritza stood at the door pretending to be a bouncer. A boy with a buzz cut and a shirt that read GO BIG OR GO HOME announced that he was a home person and so would be going big at home and Ivy clapped her hands once and said, \u201cFair,\u201d and went on to explain that maps could also be of rooms and of heads. She gave them paper and told them to draw where their good ideas went when they were asleep. Mason put out small compasses because he could not let go of the joy of objects, and Amina arranged stacks of books in little altars and pretended not to be proud of her arrangements. Ivy told the story of a map that had a mistake on it that sent people to a town that was not there, and how the town built a sign anyway so that people would not feel foolish for traveling. The children laughed and the parents laughed and she watched how the laughter sounded the same and also different and it made her chest feel like a window opening.\n\nIn the afternoon, a girl with hair that did not obey stood at the table without sitting and said, \u201cMy mother says you won\u2019t fly,\u201d and Ivy considered lying and then did not. She said, \u201cYour mother is right,\u201d and the girl pursed her lips as if that were interesting. \u201cWill you never?\u201d she asked, and Ivy said, \u201cMaybe later,\u201d and the girl said, \u201cCool,\u201d and went to color a river that looked like a snake. Ivy did not feel judged. She felt recorded, which is different.\n\nThe Austin boy sent a postcard in Liam\u2019s neat teacher cursive with a dictation at the bottom that was unmistakably his. The postcard had a picture of bats in a cave which, unhelpfully, also fly, but cave was good in the way that enclosed things are sometimes good. The dictation read: The pirates gave each other gold stars for trying. The therapist said a thing about how the sea is not out to get us. I do not believe him. But he was nice. The boy had drawn a pirate with a speech bubble that said I am terrible at pillaging feelings, and Ivy laughed and put the card on the fridge near the cow with boots and thought that perhaps the sea was not out to get her either. Perhaps it simply was, like the sky, like a sister, like a town.\n\nOn a rainy weekend afternoon when plans for the park had canceled themselves, Ruth showed up with takeout from a Thai place they both loved and an expression that suggested someone at work had decided to be stupid out loud. They sat on the floor with the cartons because the table had become a staging area for library things, and they ate curried noodles with a competence that came from a childhood where nobody made rules about elbows. Ruth listened to the story of Bryce saying \u201cI guess\u201d in three different tones like a musician listening for theme and variation. Ivy listened to Ruth talk about a bid protest that would cost someone their sense of self-importance, which would be good for the world, and then about the way her older daughter had wanted to learn a TikTok dance that made no sense to the human body. They took turns telling the truth and taking out the trash. It was the kind of evening that would not make a photograph. It was the kind that sticks.\n\n\u201cDo you think we learned worry,\u201d Ivy said when the rain went tender, \u201cor were we born with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ruth said promptly, and they both laughed. Ruth moved a stack of binders to the side with her foot. \u201cDad told me once that he took the long way home sometimes because he liked the way the lights looked from the other direction. I think he wanted us to know we could make our own routes. We heard him and then we forgot and then we remembered. That\u2019s the pattern, I think. We forget and we remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe used to keep Shakespeare in the glove compartment,\u201d Ivy said, and Ruth rolled her eyes like someone who had been told that story too many times and loved it anyway. \u201cBecause he believed in a place for everything and the glove compartment had not yet found its destiny,\u201d Ruth said, and they said the last three words together because they had a script between them and scripts are comfort.\n\nWhen Ruth left, the quiet in the house felt chosen, which is a different thing than inherited. Ivy washed the takeout containers like she might keep them forever and then put them into recycling because she believed in the magic of what would happen to them after. She went to the door and touched the rosemary like a rosary and then stood at the edge of the yard under the spruce and looked up at the healed face of the branch. The cut was not pretty. It was honest. It told the truth about having once been attached to something and now not being attached and continuing anyway. The wind tugged at her hair like it was a sleeve. A plane went over so high the sound arrived like a concept. She waved with two fingers, the rude salute that had become a benediction. She went inside to her list on the fridge and added a new line: consider ferry. Underneath she wrote in smaller letters, remind pirates they can swim. She stood there with the pen in her hand and felt something in her chest tip like a picture finding the nail it was meant to hang on. She did not feel fixed. She felt held in place, just enough to look around.\n\nThe next morning, she took a child to the window of the library and pointed out the bus stop where people waited with their human faces on. She told him every time someone got on a bus it was the beginning of a story and he looked skeptical and then he saw a woman run and make it and he said, \u201cOkay, maybe,\u201d which is what so much of love sounds like, if you listen. The day went on. The summer edged closer. The foundation sent another email with a schedule to approve and a note that said, \u201cWe put your name on the flyer,\u201d and she read the line twice, three times, and did not feel the urge to be anyone else. She took the foxglove outside into the light and found a place where it might ring its bell without hurting anyone. She wrote to the Austin boy again and told him the therapist was right, the sea was not out to get him, but he was allowed to mistrust it until it proved itself. She told him she was learning a different kind of boat. He would understand. He would draw her a picture that made the boat look impractical and brave. She would put it on the fridge next to the cow with boots and the word OKAY. The world would tilt again and she would find her feet. She always had. She was learning how to call that learning by its name.The first week of the library program began with birds because Amina refused to call it Birds, Not Flying on the signs and Mason had printed little cutouts of feathers on the color printer and had gotten ink on his thumbs like a kid with blueberry stains. They set up a table with paper gliders and another with kite kits that would have to wait for a day with more wind, and on the whiteboard Ivy drew a badly proportioned hawk with emphatic eyelashes in homage to the school mascot. She told the story of how pigeons used to carry messages tied to their legs and a boy with hair like stickleback fins said, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, you could put the message on your phone,\u201d and she agreed and also disagreed and said, \u201cSometimes the ridiculous things get the job done because they\u2019re ridiculous and nobody thinks to stop them.\u201d Bryce arrived late and leaned in the doorway like a spy, then slid into a chair and acted as if he had been there forever. When they opened a book about owls and the tactics they use to fly without sound, he took his feet off the rung of the chair and tucked them under, and he said, \u201cSo they are ninjas,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cThe woods are full of ninjas if you listen,\u201d and he pretended not to like that and liked it anyway. The room hummed with scissors and soft talk and the particular scrape of paper being folded into a guess at aerodynamics, and when the first glider drifted across the span between two tables and landed on a girl\u2019s shoulder, she squealed like someone had thrown a party just for her. Ivy\u2019s mouth was full of the taste she had begun to recognize as the flavor of doing a thing exactly appropriate to who she was capable of being, which was not heroic and also not negligible, and she held it like a piece of candy she intended to make last.\n\nThe suggestion for a ferry did not come to her in a dream, though she would have told that version of the story more readily at a dinner party. It arrived by text, Jess\u2019s particular staccato voice made into sentences: Water taxi on the Potomac. You can start with a loop. It is ridiculous and safe. I will wear my braid like a seatbelt. There was a link to the schedule and an emoji of a boat that looked like a child\u2019s toy, and Ivy tapped the link and watched the line of times arrange themselves into a day. The thought of stepping onto a floating thing did not sink her; it lifted and then bobbed, the way a cork lifts and knows itself. She thought of the boy in Austin insisting the pirates needed therapy and of herself insisting she needed a boat that did not pretend to be the sky, and she texted back Yes like someone agreeing to a small harmless dare. The plan became specific because specificity calmed a body more than platitudes, so they chose Thursday, the ten-forty departure from the Alexandria waterfront toward The Wharf, and Jess said she would bring ginger candy and Ivy said she would bring the OKAY mug in her bag as a talisman. They did not tell anyone else because crowds were not helpful when one learned a new kind of balance.\n\nThe night before the water taxi, Ivy went to check the rosemary and caught movement in the spruces that made her think of her own startle response, small and honest and not to be argued with. Grabbing the little binoculars she kept on the sill because the cardinal had converted her into a person who watched birds like a gossip column, she saw that a robin had made a nest in the crotch just below the cut place where the branch had been. The nest was a tidy bowl, grass and something fibrous that looked like the unraveled inside of a cheap mop, and the robin sat like an ancient queen, puffed and serene, while the wind negotiated terms with the needles. The sight made her throat go lemon-sour with an emotion she was tired of calling hope and needed a new name for, something you could stack on a shelf without it rolling off. She texted a picture to Diego and he replied with a photo of his hand held up like a visor: Blessings to the new apartment, he wrote, and then, because he didn\u2019t like to leave people with only metaphor, he added that he\u2019d be by in the morning to look at the sealant again, and also did she want extra compost for the foxglove because it liked to live like royalty, demanding and a little poisonous.\n\nThe HOA meeting was scheduled for Wednesday evening in the multipurpose room of the recreation center that smelled like floor cleaner and old ambition, and Ivy would have ignored it if not for the fact that Kyle had texted her the day before from a number that still had the hospital recorded as an ice-cream truck on her phone. He wrote: Re the encroachment language. It\u2019s dumb. We can fix it with an arborist clause. I don\u2019t know how to say that in human. Can you come. The message had the grammar of someone trying to be less awful, and she surprised herself by wanting to help. So she went and sat in the second row because the first row was for people who wanted to be seen and the third was for people who wanted to be unseen, and she did not want either condition. Kyle arrived late on his crutches and took a chair with a clatter, and when the agenda item came up\u2014trees, always trees\u2014he cleared his throat and then turned a dull pink. He did not have a speech, thank God, but he had the sentence, \u201cWe should require consultation before we require cutting,\u201d and he looked at Ivy and then away, and she found her hand lifting like a schoolgirl\u2019s. She said, \u201cWhen we treat living things like infractions, we make more trouble than we solve,\u201d and then, because she knew the room liked practical talk and proof, she told them about the crack inside the branch they couldn\u2019t see and the way Diego had seen it, and how the difference between reckless and careful was an hour and a ladder and someone who knew. She did not raise her voice. She did not apologize for having a voice. The board nodded in that way boards nod when they are thinking of liability and also of their children walking to the school bus, and the motion passed with a speed that made the whole thing seem easy. After, Kyle limped over and said, \u201cYou\u2019re useful,\u201d and she smiled in spite of this being a stupid compliment and said, \u201cSo are you,\u201d because a man on crutches saying I was wrong was not a thing she had seen often in rooms like this and deserved to be named.\n\nThursday morning came in a gray that meant business. The river smelled like someone had stirred it and released old stories. Jess wore a raincoat the vivid yellow of school buses and children\u2019s drawings of suns, and her braid did in fact have the tension of a seatbelt. At the end of the pier, the water taxi sat squat and confident, its hull making a sound against the pilings like chewing gum. The handful of passengers were not paying attention to courage; they were tourists with cameras and a man with earbuds who probably did this commute daily and had opinions about the captain\u2019s docking technique. Ivy took the step from wood to deck and felt the floor flex and then catch as if it had been waiting for her personally. She did not want to cry because crying felt like telling the world it had more power than it ought to, but she allowed one large breath to leave her in a way that made the skin on her arms release. Jess handed her a ginger candy and she did not unwrap it yet; she liked the weight of it in her palm like a promise. They stood by the rail because sitting seemed too much like submission, and when the boat pulled away the rope thunked against the cleat, a small violence quickly forgiven, and the water parted with no drama, like a curtain used to being asked.\n\nThey slid past the Torpedo Factory with its industrious ghosts, past a couple holding hands in a manner that suggested newness, past a knot of geese who had decided to be decorative. When they came under the flight path, which they did, because everything in this region eventually finds itself under a flight path, a plane came down toward Reagan with its landing gear out like a polite gesture. The noise passed over them like a weather pattern, loud but not punitive, and Ivy felt the old gallop begin and did not hop off the train of her body like she often did; she stayed on, watching the scenery go by, naming objects the way you might to a child learning words: bridge, gull, paddleboarder, sky. Jess, beside her, let her hand rest on the rail close to Ivy\u2019s, not touching, but near enough that contact could be made with the simplest adjustment. Ivy did not take it. She also did not step away. The boat made a wake and the wake tidied itself; this delighted her beyond reason, the way water could erase its own convulsions if given a minute. \u201cLook,\u201d Jess said softly, pointing to a man throwing a line around a cleat with the accuracy of someone who had done it a thousand times, \u201cHe could do that asleep,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cSo could my lizard brain,\u201d and Jess snorted and then turned the snort into a cough to be polite.\n\nAt The Wharf, the docks presented themselves like a catalogue of possibilities, ice cream and oysters and a soap store that made its products in the shapes of food, and they walked on boards slick with an earlier drizzle and bought coffee in cups as thin as self-esteem and sat on a bench far enough from the music that Ivy did not feel bossed by it. The river moved with purpose; boats came and went like thoughts. They were old enough to not require an itinerary and young enough to still make one in their heads. Jess told a story about a student who had tried to flirt with her by explaining cryptocurrency and Ivy laughed in a way that startled a pigeon into pretending it had meant to leave anyway. They took the eleven-fifty back and Jess put the ginger candy into Ivy\u2019s mouth without being asked, and the sweet burned a little and then did its quieting work, and Ivy watched the Watergate pass like a sentence someone had decided to leave alone and found that this made her kind toward it.\n\nThe day after the boat, in a fit of goodwill toward bureaucracy, Ivy offered to help Diego with his small business grant application, a pile of papers that asked questions like, Please quantify your passion in forms fields that only accepted whole numbers. He sat at her dining table with the careful posture he used when something was important and tried not to expose his discomfort with clauses. \u201cThey want me to say mission,\u201d he said, rubbing the bridge of his nose as if a headache might be coaxed into gentleness, \u201cI hate mission. I am not a church.\u201d Ivy drew a little ladder next to the word and said, \u201cCall it what you do when you\u2019re tired,\u201d and he said, \u201cI go outside,\u201d and she said, \u201cThen write that,\u201d and he grinned and put it down in a nugget of tidy handwriting that would be easy to love if you were reading grants for a living. They framed his work as preventing ugliness, which pleased him, and as supporting native plants, which pleased someone official somewhere, and as employing high schoolers in the summer, which made him scratch his cheek and look away because the idea of having to be a boss filled him with genuine horror. When they were done, he looked at the stack and whistled low like a man who had seen a ship built by hands and was impressed on behalf of the hands. \u201cI will owe you an orange,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cTwo,\u201d and he gave her three because he liked the math of generosity.\n\nThe moonflower opened on a Tuesday for the night-shift nurse\u2019s yard as if it had been waiting for the exact right temperature of breeze, and Diego took Ivy to see it because some things demanded witnesses. They stood in the dusk with the fence quietly verifying its purpose and the jasmine leaning into its own perfume like someone who believed in themselves but only in the dark. The white cups of the moonflower unfurled with a patience that felt instructive; not slow, exactly, but careful, like someone undoing a knot without breaking it. The nurse came out and held her hand over her mouth like she was stopping a word from escaping and then said, \u201cYou came,\u201d as if she were still surprised that people might, and they drank small paper cups of lemonade that had more sugar than necessary because sweetness is a form of defiance. Ivy breathed in and felt how her lungs could be obedient and also wild, and she thought of the boat moving on the river in the low light, the wake smoothing its panic, and she put a hand to her chest like an idiot and then refused to apologize for being one. On the way home she drove with the windows cracked and the air laid a cool line along her forearm where the sleeve ended, and she kept her eyes on the road and did not check the sky for threats, not because they weren\u2019t there, but because she was choosing not to choreograph her anxiety that evening.\n\nA week later, one of the children in the program went missing for seven terrible minutes that extended like elastic and threatened to snap. Bryce had been reading in an attitude of reluctant concentration and then he was not in his chair and not at the water fountain and not in the men\u2019s restroom where Mason knocked and then entered with an apology so crisp it could have cut paper. Maritza did the thing where she wrote the time on a scrap of paper and made the kind of face people make when their job is to be the adult in a room with adults. Ivy felt the first cold dart of adrenaline and remembered that it is supposed to be helpful, that its job is not to punish but to sharpen. She walked the aisles of the stacks on the far side of the magazine racks and then lowered herself onto her knees and looked under the table in the study room and there he was, curled around a book as if it were a baby animal, hiding in that way children do when the world is too large\u2014under a thing, shrinking the sky. \u201cHey,\u201d she said softly, a voice she saved for times when she did not want to increase the size of mistakes. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring out where you are.\u201d Bryce looked at her like someone thwarted and said, \u201cYou knew how to find me,\u201d and she said, \u201cI have a map of you in my head,\u201d and he rolled his eyes with infinite disdain and crawled out and said, \u201cI was not hiding,\u201d and she said, \u201cI will agree to that lie,\u201d and the relief passed through her like a hot drink. Maritza made a note later about doors and sweeps and ways to be more explicit about how one leaves a room and the next day she posted a sign that said, \u201cIf you are going to be in the bunker, tell your captain,\u201d which Bryce pretended not to see and then pointed to with a smirk three times in the week that followed.\n\nThere were other days when the body was less willing to be trained and Ivy accepted that the training would be lifelong and possibly the point. In the freezer aisle of the grocery store a documentary played on the tiny screen embedded in a display of pre-sauced pastas, showing a wing flexing as if it were demonstrating the right answer, and her hands went immediately into the cold place as if she could freeze the panic out of them. An old woman in a sweatsuit with rhinestones that spelled out an imperative\u2014SHINE\u2014was deciding between two brands of peas and said, \u201cThey get you with the lighting,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cThey do,\u201d and that was enough to be not alone. At the car she sat for a moment and then wrote Tuesday fear in her notebook with the kind of handwriting she used when she wanted to change her brain with the power of neat letters, and she put a star next to it and the star was sloppy and she let it be.\n\nRuth had her own crack in the branch and it announced itself in the parking garage of her office building when the elevator made a noise at the sixth floor and stopped and then did nothing. She called Ivy afterward, already in her car because she had walked down the stairs like a queen leaving a throne she\u2019d never wanted, and said, \u201cI cried in the elevator with strangers and a man offered me a cough drop,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cIf heaven is anything, it is a place where strangers have cough drops,\u201d and Ruth laughed and then inhaled too sharply because laughter had been a surprise. \u201cI did not enjoy being about to not be in charge,\u201d she said, and Ivy said, \u201cNobody does,\u201d and then they talked about the merits of taking a moment to unstick one\u2019s tongue from the roof of one\u2019s mouth, which is a thing both had learned in different rooms for different reasons. Later that week they sat on Ivy\u2019s couch with the OKAY mug between them like a joint custody agreement and read a sonnet their father had loved, flipping the book of Shakespeare with the familiarity of two people who had watched a man thumb these same pages in a truck\u2019s half light. \u201cWhen in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes,\u201d Ruth read, and Ivy finished \u201cI all alone beweep my outcast state,\u201d and they made faces at the word beweep because some words need to be mocked to be properly cherished, and when they reached the couplet, the way love makes the morning sing like a lark high out of the sullen earth, Ruth cleared her throat in a manner that signaled a decision had been made to be moved and said, \u201cI hate that he could make a person feel better with ten seconds of vowels,\u201d and Ivy handed her the mug as if it contained not tea but permission.\n\nThe invitation to present at a tiny conference for regional librarians came via Maritza, who had the gleeful look of someone nominating a friend for an award that came with a mug. \u201cIt\u2019s at The Wharf,\u201d she said, which made the suggestion feel like a good omen, and the email included a phrase that cracked Ivy open a little: We are interested in programs that articulate courage without spectacle. She said yes before she thought about who else would be on the bill, before she thought about what wearing a blazer under lights might do to her armpits, before her brain had time to spin out scenarios in which she stood up and forgot every story as if she had been unplugged. After she hung up, she put her forehead against the front door because it was cool and solid and she whispered, \u201cOkay,\u201d and did not bother with the second okay because sometimes once is enough if you have just been brave at a keyboard.\n\nOn an afternoon when the air had the metallic taste of imminent storm, she saw Kyle crouched in her front yard examining the place where the foxglove had decided to exist. He was not wearing his crutch, which meant something about his leg had amended itself, or perhaps it meant he was being stubborn. \u201cIt looks like a church,\u201d he said without greeting, nodding at the foxglove\u2019s bells. \u201cAnd like a warning.\u201d Ivy stood next to him and bent her knees to see the plant at its own height, a perspective that made most things more comprehensible. \u201cDiego says not to eat it,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is the sort of advice that makes you wonder who he knows who would.\u201d Kyle snorted. He had the air of someone permanently embarrassed to have been saved, which turned out to be a decent foundation for a personality if you were willing to sand off the arrogance on the edges. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch the oaks over on Muir Lane,\u201d he said, apropos of nothing, \u201cA guy wanted them down because acorns hit his roof and scared his dog. I told him we support dog feelings and also that the trees were a hundred years old, and he said, \u2018So what,\u2019 and I said, \u2018So everything,\u2019 and it was a very profound moment for me.\u201d Ivy said, \u201cYou are becoming a person I could invite to a brunch,\u201d and he looked briefly proud and then said, \u201cI hate brunch,\u201d and she said, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nThe day of the presentation came in hot and damp and full of traffic that considered the law one opinion among many. The room at The Wharf was one of those rooms that wanted to be a boat when it grew up, full of wood and light and the faint smell of sea air manufactured by a machine. Maritza introduced Ivy with adjectives that made her want to leave and when Ivy walked to the lectern she carried the OKAY mug because it felt like an amulet and also because she had decided to be a person who did not mind being seen with her magic. She spoke about Maps and Journeys and the boy who said he was going to go big at home, about the girl who drew a river that was a snake and then learned that rivers love a path, about making a room feel like a bunker and then teaching the children to announce their location because privacy is not always safety. She did not use the word trauma because she did not like to throw it around a room where not everyone had signed a waiver. She used the word care so many times it lost its edges and became what she needed it to be: both a verb and a noun, both something you offer and something you require. She told them about the night-blooming garden because it said something better than she could about timing and desire and gentle insistence. She said the sentence, \u201cCourage is a trickle, catch it in teacups,\u201d and saw Jess, who had snuck into a chair in the back, lift her hand and make the shape of a cup in the air and she did not cry. When she finished, the room did that thing where it made a sound like held breath turning into clapping, and a woman with a lanyard that would have strangled a horse came up and said, \u201cWe needed that,\u201d which is a combination of words that can get you through a week if you are careful.\n\nOn the walk back to the dock, Jess asked whether the water taxi counted as communion and Ivy said it did and also that she would not mind ice cream because she wanted sugar the way freshly brave people want to celebrate with something benign. They ate standing up, the cone dripping a little, and watched a thunderhead assemble itself like a gathering committee. The boat came and they got on and Ivy chose the same place at the rail as before because she liked to repeat rituals when they had worked. The storm held off while they slid across the surface, the edges of the waves rippling with that jade green that made the Potomac look briefly like a better river than it was. As they passed under the planes again, a jet came low enough that Ivy could see the burned belly smudges and the handprint of heat on the metal, and she felt the tightness and then she was able to consider the tightness without becoming it. She thought of a thing her father had once said when they were caught on I-95 behind a truck that smelled like pigs, the very definition of a misery: \u201cWe are in this life together with other people,\u201d and he had said it not as a comfort but as a practical assessment, and she held the sentence like a rail until the plane became less loud and the boat pulled into the dock with that small cough ships make when they\u2019ve done their job.\n\nBy August the spruces had become background again, which is a sign of healing one forgets to honor. The robin fledged and the nest remained as a sculpture of the moment before adulthood, and occasionally a squirrel stuck its face in, perplexed, as if it had been promised something more interesting. The grant came through for Diego with a check that looked smaller than it was because money is never as impressive as work, and he bought a printer that made letters that did not look like a crime and a pair of loppers so shiny they would have been illegal in some countries. He hired a teenager with a mustache that had not yet committed to itself and a girl named Ines who wore a bandanna like a crown and told the men what to do with the calm of an air traffic controller, and Ivy watched the way he learned to say, \u201cWe,\u201d instead of, \u201cI,\u201d and wondered how many times in a life you got that lesson before it took.\n\nThe pirate boy in Austin sent another postcard, this one a drawing of a boat with a ferry sign on it in letters that leaned into the wind. The note, dictated but clearly his: If pirates go to therapy they talk about why they like the boat and also why the boat forgot to be kind. I went on a boat that did not steal. It was okay. The R in therapy had fully healed. Ivy put it on the fridge next to the cow with boots and, almost without thinking, she added a doodle of a cup with little handles like ears and wrote under it in small letters, more, and she did not explain to herself exactly what she meant.\n\nWhen school started and the library filled with the friction of formal learning, the program shifted to a late afternoon hum. Teen volunteers in hoodies arrived with new arcs of exhaustion under their eyes and an increased capacity for making lists that had unnecessary boxes to check. Ivy found herself teaching the same lesson in three costumes: to a seven-year-old about how to break a paragraph into thought-bites, to a ninth grader about how to take the good of a story and leave the nonsense, to a father about how to not stand in the doorway with his arms crossed while his daughter did long division, and the repeat saved her time and also did not because people require customization like computers. She began to wear a thin gold chain Ruth had given her with a charm the shape of a small half-circle. \u201cIt\u2019s the other half of all the things you think you have to finish,\u201d Ruth had said, and Ivy had laughed too loudly and then swallowed the laugh like something hot, and when she touched the charm she remembered to stop at half sometimes and not call it failure.\n\nThere were days when she thought of airports and did not go floppy inside. There were days when she could step into the shadow of the highway sign without thinking of bolts working themselves free out of boredom. There were nights when she woke with her heart galloping and counted backward from one hundred by seven and could not get past seventy-nine and forgave herself for missing some numbers. She did not make a new appointment with a virtual reality therapist and she did not cancel the calendar reminder about it; both decisions felt like progress in the mildest possible way. She took the train to visit a friend in Richmond and stood on the platform feeling a hair\u2019s breadth brave, which is enough for a day. The conductor, a woman in a hat that made her look like a person you could give a mission to, punched her ticket and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll like the curve near Fredericksburg, it makes the river look like it isn\u2019t mad at you anymore,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cI accept that,\u201d and she stood and watched the way trees blur into coherence when you allow them to.\n\nOne evening in September, the light went saturated and golden as if the day were apologizing for having been humid, and Ivy and Jess and Diego sat on Ivy\u2019s front steps with their feet on the concrete like a youth group. Jess had taken out her braid and looked, improbably, younger, wild hair announcing that none of this had been easy and it had also not been a loss. Diego had a splinter he was refusing to tweeze because he believed in the body spitting out what didn\u2019t belong, and he held his finger up to the light like a tiny judge. A neighbor boy practiced skateboard tricks in the street with a little death wish and a strong helmet, and their talk went the way talk goes when it isn\u2019t trying to be forced into a moral. Jess told them about a mother who had said her latte tasted like failure and meant that her daughter was not where she was supposed to be in algebra. Diego told them about a woman who had asked him to put in fake plants because she did not trust herself not to kill the real ones and how he had nodded and then put in three pots of rosemary anyway because he wanted her to forgive herself for being herself. Ivy talked about Bryce reading without making war noises for twenty minutes and then looking up and saying, \u201cI don\u2019t hate this as much,\u201d and how that sometimes feels like the length of a person\u2019s progress in any given category, and the three of them put the backs of their heads against the door and looked up where the planes drew invisible lines between places they were not required to be. The spruces, dignified and a little heroic in their patched places, made the sound of wind dragging its fingers through intention. The foxglove had given up its bells for the season and was preparing invisibly for later. Someone nearby was grilling something that smelled like forgiveness. The day slid toward evening, and they let it, and no one stood up to make it do anything else.The first cool snap arrived like a rumor that turned out to be true. In the mornings, the dew slicked the grass and made the concrete steps look confident, and the air had enough bite to make Ivy think of splitting wood, which she had never done and possibly never would, but the thought of a pile of ready kindling satisfied some ancient part of her that liked stacks. The library program shifted with the school year into afternoons that felt like the long exhale after lunch, the building filling with the friction of backpacks and the soft aggression of sneakers. Maritza hung a new sign on the door that said in her own blocky hand More Reading, Less Apologizing, and parents smiled in that helpless way that meant they did not know whether it was addressed to them. Ivy added a row of clipboards to the wall because clipboards made teenagers feel like their tasks were adult, and Mason color-coded the markers until the spectrum pleased his sense of order so deeply he had to take a picture and file it somewhere labeled Satisfaction.\n\nA letter from the HOA arrived with uncharacteristic cheer. It was an invitation to the fall block party and a request for volunteers that read like a ransom note. Ivy read it twice and then texted Jess a photo because the line about \u201cbringing your famous dish\u201d was arrogant in a community where people\u2019s famous dishes rarely deserved the adjective. Kyle had signed it with a black pen that bled through like enthusiasm. When Ivy saw him later on the sidewalk, he lifted his crutch slightly in greeting\u2014he was almost done with it, a fact he flaunted like a temporary tattoo\u2014and said, \u201cWe bought biodegradable forks,\u201d as if this might absolve him of past sins. She told him she would bring deviled eggs because she had accidentally made them famous in her family, and his eyes widened as if fame were a quality he did not want to be responsible for witnessing.\n\nJess burned her hand on a Friday in the way that happens when speed and hot instruments occupy the same square foot of real estate. It was not dramatic\u2014no trip to the ER, no bandage that invited strangers to ask for the tale\u2014but it was bad enough that she called Ivy from the back of the shop with her voice pitched low to keep the regulars from panicking about their espresso. \u201cCan you be a person who pretends to be a barista for a day?\u201d she asked, and Ivy said yes before she could remember that the machine hissed like a cat and liked to be coaxed the way stubborn children liked to be coaxed. She found herself behind the counter in an apron that still held the smell of lemon oil and milk, taking cash with the speed of someone who respects exact change and nodding at people like she knew their complicated regular orders by heart. A man in a blazer ordered a cortado and explained how much he hated the word mouthfeel, and a woman with lipstick as immaculate as a vow said quietly that she needed her latte to taste like success and then smiled, embarrassed by the metaphor that had escaped. An airline pilot came in with a rolling suitcase and a cap under his arm and a posture that suggested he had been trained to keep strangers calm, and when he said, \u201cDouble shot, room for cream,\u201d without glancing up from his phone, Ivy felt the quick cold bloom in her chest and then watched it recede as she tamped the grounds with the tender aggression Jess had taught her, steam wobbling the air. The pilot left a dollar and said, \u201cYou\u2019re quick,\u201d as if speed were a moral virtue, and Jess, bandage tucked into her sleeve, leaned against the back counter and mouthed the word hero with exaggerated irony, making Ivy snort so loudly a scone-wielding teenager looked up, satisfied to have caught an adult misbehaving.\n\nDiego roped her into a rooftop job for a restaurant down by the tracks that wanted to grow herbs like confidence. He pretended it was a standard garden but then mentioned the ladder in a tone that let her decide whether she was in the mood to be brave. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\u201d he said, \u201cYou can see the whole parking lot and the train. The sky makes a face at you, but it\u2019s not rude.\u201d She said yes because ladders had been a small private battlefield since she was nine and her father had asked her to hand him a hammer on the second rung and she had frozen and he had not been unkind about it. The restaurant\u2019s roof was a square of gravel and tar with rails too thin to feel trustworthy, and when she stepped up and the world widened, her knees made their preliminary complaint, but the rest of her body busied itself with the practicalities. The planters needed lining. The soil needed to be lifted from bags without tearing them into confetti. Diego had labeled seedlings with pencil on sticks because he believed in the tenderness of graphite. They crouched and worked with the ceremony of people doing something unremarkable that would become remarkable later to a diner who tasted basil that had known a train whistle. When a freight train blared below them and the roof vibrated in solidarity, she put a hand flat on the tar and found that touching the thing that felt unstable helped. Diego said nothing because he had learned when to leave space in the soundtrack, and when they came down the ladder he made her pause on the last rung and feel both feet on two planes before adding the third, so that the body learned a choreography that announced itself as useful.\n\nBryce found her on the third day of September with a paper that looked like it had been attacked by a flock of red pens. \u201cMy teacher thinks I\u2019m messy,\u201d he said, presenting the carnage with the resigned pride of someone who knew he had made a mess and also that messes were sometimes interesting. Ivy read the comments like small footnotes on a bigger story and then turned the paper over and drew him a box and said, \u201cThis is the place your ideas go before they practice being tidy,\u201d and Bryce said, \u201cLike a waiting room,\u201d and she said, \u201cYes, and there\u2019s no old magazines,\u201d and they looked at each other with the relief of a metaphor that put its coat on and sat down. He came two afternoons in a row without complaint, which was the closest he could come to adoration, and his mother stood in the doorway with a face like someone who had expected a fight and been offered soup. Ivy wanted to say to her, not all of this needs to be an emergency, but then the woman\u2019s phone chimed with a text that made her eyes go wide and sorry and Ivy did not say anything about emergencies to anyone because some days were just a stack you didn\u2019t have the right shelf for.\n\nFor the block party, Ivy made seventy-two deviled eggs and then realized she had not left any for herself to fail at later and had to swipe two halves off the tray at the edge of the rec center while no one was looking. People arrived with food and folding chairs and the kind of lawn games that require either two beers or none to be tolerable. Kids drew chalk roads down the middle of Prospect Court toward a drain that became a lake in their heads. Someone had rented a bounce house, and Ivy watched it inflate with the slow awakening of something cheerful, the blower whining like a hairdryer having an opinion. Kyle set up a table for a silent auction to benefit the teen center and put out a sign-up sheet for stew-making after the weather decided to behave like a story about fall. He limped a little, favoring the leg not because it hurt anymore but because his body had liked the drama and was reluctant to surrender it. He cornered Ivy by the lemonade vat and said, \u201cThe arborist clause passed,\u201d and she said, \u201cLook at you, making reasonable things,\u201d and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible habit,\u201d and then he stared at her tray and added, \u201cThese are famous,\u201d in a tone that made her want to ruin them on purpose just to reset the myth. Diego arrived with a crate of late tomatoes that looked like planets and did not write a price anywhere because he wanted people to ask him and he wanted to have the pleasure of saying, \u201cPay me what feels like gratitude.\u201d Jess wore a bandana over her burn and took the microphone at some point to thank people for bringing things that could be eaten with forks that would not haunt the creek, and Ivy found herself with tears at the point on her cheekbone that wetness always surprised, not because the speech was good\u2014it was\u2014but because the sound system cut out halfway and Jess kept talking anyway as if the voice itself were enough, and people leaned in, the way you do when the story requires you.\n\nAfter dark, a string of lights made the street look like a wedding. Teenagers pretended to disdain the cornhole game and then went into sudden raptures when a beanbag hit wood with the right force and angle, the physics of their own bodies briefly pleasing them. Mrs. Dalrymple arrived late in a jacket the color of costly wine and and made loud evaluations of people\u2019s coleslaw with a friendliness that undermined the cruelty. She told Ivy that the foxglove on her front walk looked like a choir, and when Ivy said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t eat it,\u201d Mrs. Dalrymple looked personally offended and said, \u201cI am not a goat,\u201d and then kissed the air in Ivy\u2019s direction as if that ended the matter. Jess pressed a small envelope into Ivy\u2019s hand with the gravity of a graduate handing over a diploma; inside was a gift certificate printed in the coffee shop font for One Future Espresso on the House, redeemable at the moment you are a person who gets on a plane. Ivy folded it into her wallet like a pressed leaf, refused to look at its future too directly, and decided not to tell anyone about it in case she needed to let it live as possibility without dying under the weight of witnesses.\n\nOn a Saturday that surprised everyone by being clear and gentle, Ivy took Ruth on the train to Richmond and did not make it a test in her head. Ruth appeared on the platform with two coffees and a scarf that made her look like she had important opinions about galleries, and when the train glided in like a well-adjusted animal, they got on without inventing rituals. They faced each other, the way siblings sometimes forget they prefer to, and the countryside began its polite blur. Ruth told a story about a bid protest that had been written in such excellent passive voice that she\u2019d considered framing it, and Ivy told her about the pirate boy\u2019s ferries and the way the night-blooming garden had offered her a religion she could live with. They spoke of their father without landing on whether he\u2019d been good at everything or just good at it often enough to fool their hearts. Ruth admitted, in a tone that suggested data rather than confession, that she had counted tiles on the elevator floor while it stalled and named them by color to stay in place, and Ivy told her the trick about Tuesday fear and they decided fear kept a schedule like trash pickup and sometimes you took the bins out and sometimes it rained and you brought them back in without shame. In Richmond they walked past their old haunt where murals changed with the seasons until one of them stuck, and the bakery where at nineteen Ivy had learned that croissants can heal some evils and not others. On the return train they sat with their knees just touching, an old level of intimacy neither of them had had the right to since they were girls in the backseat of a car with no air conditioning and a father who sang like a person who had swallowed a radio. They promised nothing to each other because promising sometimes made things break, and yet both walked away agreeing silently to repair what could be repaired.\n\nThe first cold rain arrived with a temper. It drove people into the library with hair that had given up and cardigans carried like infants and the insistence that the Internet was a right. In the children\u2019s room a toddler howled until his mother put a board book in his hands that had a mirror, and then he howled at his own face with pleasure. An older man fell asleep in a chair and made an occasional noise like a drawer opening and closing. Ivy was halfway through explaining to a fifth grader that metaphors were like costumes that made some truths easier to say when a boy in the corner began to cough. It would have been a small event except that the cough became an insistence and then a problem, and his sister\u2019s face went white in the way that makes a room concentrate. Ivy crossed to them with the speed she saved for emergencies, announced herself calmly because panic likes to be introduced to its opponent, and put her hand on the boy\u2019s back with the firm motion that reminds a body where it is. He\u2019d put too many dry pretzels in his mouth and his brain had staged a protest; the sister said, \u201cHe does that,\u201d and Ivy had the glamorous vision of herself doing the Heimlich in front of the biographies and then decided glamour had killed more sensible decisions than anyone cared to admit. She asked him to cough again in a tone that implied trust, and when he did the pretzel moved, the room resumed its regular noise, and someone clapped quietly near the tax forms because people like to turn relief into a ceremony. The boy\u2019s mother arrived from the copier with a stack of papers and the look of someone whose morning had tried to escape, and Ivy showed her her hand and said, \u201cWe were here,\u201d and the mother swallowed and nodded the nod that lives at the border of gratitude and embarrassment, and later Maritza stuck her head into Ivy\u2019s cubbyhole and said, \u201cYou should teach a class called Do Not Make a Spectacle of Yourself for Love,\u201d and Ivy laughed, the sound clipping off at the end like a bird changing direction in midair.\n\nThe ferris wheel at National Harbor announced itself to her in postcards and social media photos and the lit-up nights she could see from the water taxi. Its lights stacked in a circle like good intentions. Jess, with a smirk that said she knew when to offer temptation and when to back away, mentioned that standing under it and watching the cars rise could be a way to make friends with the idea of height without requiring heroism. Ivy let the suggestion sit on the table between them like a plate of cookies that might be a prank. On an evening so clear it felt dehydrated, they took the water taxi with the ease of people whose bodies had learned a trick and walked to the base of the wheel. Children hopped with the nervous energy of older electricity. A man proposed to a woman with a ring that looked like it would be exhausting to keep track of and two strangers applauded as if romance were a sport. Jess kept a hand in her coat pocket and did not reach out for Ivy, a master class in not crowding. Ivy stepped forward until she was close enough to hear the carriage doors shut and the hydraulic hiss that accompanied ascent, and she watched the mechanics behave themselves, the way the giant equipment did its diligent work. She pictured herself inside one of the cars and her body did its opening maneuver and then its closing one, and she said, softly, \u201cNot today,\u201d and Jess said, \u201cI like today,\u201d and they stood and let the wheel turn above them, both of them looking up like children forgiven something without anyone having to name it.\n\nWhen the conference organizers sent a link to a video of Ivy\u2019s talk\u2014a thing she had not known would exist\u2014she did not watch it for three days. The icon sat on her desktop like a small eye. She finally made tea and waited until the house felt like a church after a service and clicked play with a face so set in concentration she looked, to herself, like someone trying to move furniture with telepathy. She watched her own mouth shape the sentences and did not throw up. She observed that she used her hands less than she thought and moved her head like a pigeon when she was pleased and said \u201cum\u201d fewer times than her private enemies would have preferred. She listened to her voice talk about care and maps and about not needing to produce a spectacle to prove one\u2019s courage. She thought about the girl who had asked whether she would never fly again and felt no need to answer more fully now than she had then. When the video ended, she closed the screen gently and let the room refill with regular air. She put the OKAY mug in the sink because it had done its duty by watching, and then she opened the email from the virtual reality therapist and typed: Thank you for the brochure. I am not ready to book, but I am ready to talk about what ready might look like. She sent it before the part of her that loved to hold onto the edges could snatch the action back.\n\nDiego began a project with a high school environmental club that had somehow convinced the principal to let them tear up a strip of useless lawn and put in a rain garden. He asked Ivy to help the kids write the signs because after a lifetime of reading seed packets he respected fonts, and she brought a bag of stencils, which felt like an admission of being a certain kind of person. The teenagers came at the work with knees and elbows and snacks and the kind of intense fairness that makes adults nostalgic and tired, and they argued briefly over whether labeling a plant Joe-Pye weed was rude. Ines, now promoted to the role of assistant who did not suffer fools, stood with a clipboard and refused to accept any label that did not include the Latin name because she believed in dignity even for perennials. They put their hands in the dirt and pulled up a piece of plastic buried so deep it felt like an fossilized mistake, and when the hole filled with water after a rain and behaved like a pond, they watched bees land for a drink and cheered in a circle like a team with a mascot Ivy would have loved to see. When the principal came by, robust with good public relations, and said, \u201cWhat we need is stewardship,\u201d Diego nodded and did not say that what he needed was more shovels and a way to pay Ines more than a teenager\u2019s respectable wage, and Ivy wrote on a sign in the tidiest letters she owned: You are here. The water is here. We want both to be here later, too.\n\nOn a Thursday with a sky the color of laundry left too long in the basket, an email arrived from the Austin family with a video attached. The boy stood in a kitchen that had the exact same kind of lamp Ivy had once recommended for better reading light and read a paragraph from Treasure Island in a voice that had widened. He looked at the camera at the end and said, \u201cTherapy for pirates is not working but it is funny,\u201d and then he added a PS that had been obviously staged by Liam: We are proud of you for boats. Ivy watched it four times and grieved in a controlled and generous way, which is to say she did not punish herself with the kind of longing that had often run her days when she was younger. She wrote back that she had found a ferry that did not lie about what it was, and that she would send him a drawing of a boat with accurate proportions, and she drew one and it was ridiculous and the perspective was wrong and she sent it anyway.\n\nAutumn deepened its voice and the trees in Burke did their quiet work. The spruces showed off less because their job was to endure and they did not collect Instagram likes. The foxglove yellowed and let its own seeds go, a letting that impressed Ivy so much that she knelt and watched for an indecorous amount of time, the pods letting go with confidence, like a person stepping off a bus in a new city with the address written on the inside of their wrist. The rosemary remained itself, as if it had signed a contract with the season. Ivy put her hand to it every time she left the house, the fingers slow on the spines, and sometimes she put her hand to it upon return too, as if asking to be accepted back into a life that was more and more of her own making. When planes passed in twos, she noticed and did not always organize her breath around them. When the elevator at the municipal building made a lurchy sound and she was inside it, she closed her eyes and counted to six and then to ten and then they were at the right floor and she did not have to develop a new religion to explain her survival. When Jess left a box on her porch with a note that read For bravery hangovers and inside was a loaf of cinnamon bread so soft it offended physics, Ivy sat on the steps and tore off a heel and ate it without plate or plan, and the day sat next to her like a friend who meant well and did not always know what to do with their hands.\n\nNovember announced its seriousness with a wind that wanted to argue. The library put up a display of cookbooks and novels with pies on the cover that made Mason roll his eyes until Amina rolled hers right back and reminded him that gratitude is allowed to be corny if it feeds you. Ivy made a list that included words like brine and nutmeg and the phrase forgive the dryness if the turkey forgets itself, and then added a line under it in smaller script: remember to be kind to the part of you that is still standing at Gate C23. She did not read it every morning like a magic spell. She read it sometimes and then forgot and then remembered, which seemed to be the way of all the important things. The program put up a map of the neighborhood and asked people to pin the place where they had been brave in an unremarkable way. Pins clustered at the bus stop, at the coffee shop, in the aisles of the grocery store where the freezer section television showed an airplane wing quivering dutifully over polite pasta. A child pinned a spot on the sidewalk outside the rec center and wrote in a blocky hand: Here I told the big kids no, and Ivy wanted to put a crown on the pin. Someone pinned the roof of the restaurant, and she knew it was Diego because his dot was slightly to the left of where it should have been, his superstition against exactness showing itself at last.\n\nOn the morning before Thanksgiving, Ruth called from her car with the sound of tires making that rice-cracker crunch over cold leaves. \u201cI am on the wrong highway on purpose,\u201d she announced, and Ivy said, \u201cBlessings on your father\u2019s favorite sin,\u201d and Ruth laughed in a way that made you forgive whatever you hadn\u2019t liked about your day. They proposed a plan to throw their family at the holiday without allowing the holiday to throw itself at them. There would be a table. There would be a prayer in the form of a toast. There would be a pie with a crack that meant integrity. Ivy would bring deviled eggs and not apologize for the paprika being uneven. Jess would show up late with a loaf of bread still warm because she had her own kind of liturgy to perform with a machine and a few miracles. Diego would stop by with a bag of herbs and refuse to sit down because his body did not trust chairs when there were tasks. Kyle would arrive and stand awkwardly in the doorway as if gratitude required a permission slip, and someone would hand him a plate and he would discover he liked cranberry sauce in the way of men who have avoided fruit on principle and then give up. They would go around and say things because that is what people who try do, and when it came to Ivy she would speak carefully and without spectacle. She would say, \u201cI am grateful for the ground matching my feet most of the time,\u201d and someone would laugh and someone would look at her as if she had said the true name of a thing, and she would feel, not fixed, but located. Afterwards, she would stand at her sink and wash plates with a rhythm that was close to joy, the kind that lets your mind unspool something it had kept too tightly, and outside a plane would sew its red and white lights in a neat pattern and she would look up and wave with two fingers, not out of defiance, but out of recognition. The night would be a lake again, and sometimes lakes reflect the sky and sometimes they keep their secrets. She would be all right with both.Chapter Nine\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving, Burke wore the embarrassed look of a town that had been overeager with its gratitude and was now trying to tidy up the glitter. Leaves that ought to have surrendered weeks ago clung like stubborn thoughts to the oaks along Ox Road. The air had a clean edge that made Ivy think of knives sharpened in the backs of kitchens, competent and not malicious. In the library, Mason put away a display of harvest books with cranberries on their covers and replaced them with titles about snow and soup, arranging them with such ceremonial satisfaction that Amina murmured, \u201cLet the man build his winter altar,\u201d and did not say all the things she thought about how every book about snow ignored the sludgy truth of parking lots. Ivy moved slowly in the new cold, every breath a rehearsal for a speech she would not have to give.\n\nAt home, she took the last of the deviled eggs out of the refrigerator and ate them over the sink with a kind of reverence that felt almost religious in its specificity. She washed the tray and set it on the rack to dry and realized she liked this part better than the part where she was admired for paprika. The quiet after doing had always been her favorite hymn. She wiped the counter with the flat of her palm rather than the rag because some days the skin wanted to prove it could touch the world and be fine, and then she went to the door and pressed her fingers into the rosemary until the scent lifted into her nose like a reminder that you could ruin and still be fragrant.\n\nDecember came in like the person at a party who knocks quietly and then ends up staying long enough to help do the dishes. The coffee shop filled with people who wore good coats and wanted small square pastries that cracked like polite secrets. Jess chose the longest night of the year the way some people choose an argument to end, and declared a vigil for anyone who wanted to sit with a hot thing in their hands and say out loud a line from a book that made the dark feel like a visitor instead of a landlord. Ivy brought her father\u2019s battered Shakespeare, the sonnets half dog-eared, half asleep. She stood in the soft lantern light of the shop with the rest of them\u2014Kyle in a sweater that revealed he owned one, Diego holding a small wreath made entirely of rosemary, a teenager who had sworn allegiance to eyeliner reciting a line from Dickinson about the zero at the bone\u2014and when it was her turn she read about the lark, that thawed thing that stands in for mornings when the calendar makes morning a matter of faith. Her voice did not wobble the way she thought it might. Jess stood behind the counter like a ship\u2019s captain and handed out ginger cookies to anyone who needed their mouth to be busy during grief, which is to say everyone.\n\nThe virtual reality therapist wrote back with a Thursday, and then another, accommodating in the way of people who understand that staying on the horse is more about the horse knowing it will not be asked to do tricks. The office was over a bakery, and the smell of butter and sugar came up the stairwell with a sense of humor. The name on the door read: S. Sen, PhD, and the waiting room had a plant that was not quite alive and chairs that did not make a spectacle of themselves. Dr. Sen was small and carried her seriousness like a shawl that could be unfolded or taken off. She had the kind of bracelets that made a soft, intelligent sound when she gestured. When they sat, she did not turn on a machine or pull out a headset immediately. She asked Ivy to talk about what her fear liked to pretend to be, and when Ivy made a joke, Dr. Sen laughed in a way that suggested she took jokes seriously, which made them feel like something other than deflection.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not begin with a door that shuts,\u201d Dr. Sen said, tapping a thick index card on which she\u2019d written a list that looked like a menu and felt like a dare. \u201cLet\u2019s begin with a place where the sky is close but you have shoes on the ground. Have you been to the aviation museum\u2014the one near Dulles?\u201d\n\n\u201cUdvar-Hazy,\u201d Ivy said, because she had, in a tilting way, years ago with a boyfriend who liked museums like they were gyms for his mind. They had stood under the big belly of the shuttle and he had cried in a newsreel way, while she had read placards about rivets and eaten a pretzel with too much salt.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cut-through plane you can walk inside,\u201d Dr. Sen said, drawing a little box on the card next to a line that read: Stand in the hollow thing. \u201cAn illusion of enclosure. We can choose when to step in and when to step out. Would that offend you less than being trapped with fifty strangers and a captain?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt offends me at the correct volume,\u201d Ivy said, and watched Dr. Sen tuck, with care, the index card into a folder as if it were a geode to be cracked later for glitter.\n\nThey went on a Wednesday when schools were in but field trip buses still somehow reproduced in that parking lot like cells. Children moved like ideas, darting and unmanageable. The museum was a barn for genius, full of huge suspended animals of metal and muscle, a cathedral with a tin heart. As they crossed the central hall, a man with a microphone gave some shoulders facts they would forget, and a toddler cried with the righteous grief of someone who had been refused a sip of someone else\u2019s soda. Dr. Sen walked half a step behind Ivy, not like a bodyguard, more like a person who did not need to go first. The sectioned plane sat with its seam open to air, the belly exposed in cross-section like a proper anatomy drawing. People walked through it in the casual way you walk into places you are sure will not trap you. The carpet had that gentle, famous dirt of millions of steps on synthetics. The windows were eyes that could not open.\n\n\u201cDo you want to touch it first,\u201d Dr. Sen asked, \u201cor do you want it to touch you?\u201d It was the kind of question that had two right answers. Ivy put her hand flat on the cool metal near the door, very aware of the vastness of the thing attached to this square of atoms. The skin of the plane did not pretend to be anything; it reflected her in a warped way, a woman bent by gloss. Inside, a bored volunteer in a cardigan nodded at them like she was taking attendance at a church she did not belong to. Ivy stepped in because she had promised herself she would once be the kind of person who steps in, and then again later. Her heart did the familiar unhappy horse, but in this room of echoes there was also the sound of children saying look, which she received like a benediction she hadn\u2019t asked for and still needed. Dr. Sen leaned her shoulder into the jamb and did not speak. Ivy stood in the cut of the aisle and looked down at the carpet and then at the windows, which held a view of the parking lot, and then at the front where a gate would be if it were a plane and not a memory of one. She took one breath that counted and then another that might have and then one that did not count at all because it was simply a breath, and then she stepped backward, and then forward again, and the switching did not unmake the day.\n\nOn the way out, she and Dr. Sen stood under the shuttle for the proper amount of awe\u2014its tiles like dragon scales, the burn scars both tidy and brutal. A boy walked by holding a model of a biplane and humming the first six notes of a song meant to make people braver than they were, and Ivy smiled despite herself. In the gift shop she bought Bryce a pencil with a tiny soft airplane eraser he could dismantle while pretending not to care, and she bought herself a postcard of the walkway into a fuselage so she could put it on the fridge and allow it to be not a threat but a postcard. In the parking lot, Dr. Sen said, \u201cYour brain wrote a new sentence,\u201d in the tone of a person announcing a measurable thing, and Ivy thought of all the times her brain had been a poor copyist and wrote this one down with a pen instead.\n\nThe first snow was a coward that melted the minute it thought of staying. Children ran into it with mouths open anyway and let it dissolve on their tongues like a cheap miracle. The second snow arrived with less apology and more intent, and Burke did the suburban arithmetic of kitchen inventory and driveway physics. Jess sent a text in the morning that said: Espresso machine will not survive being moved near the door. I resign myself to tea. Come sit with me and make jokes about footprints. Ivy went and brought her own thermos of something that admitted it was hot leaf water and sat at the window watching the world decide to be softer. When the power flickered at noon and then sighed its way to off across their block, the shop was suddenly a room from a different century, all voice and breath and light from elsewhere. People stayed anyway, because proximity is the power alternative we forget to stock. Jess produced a percolator the size of a hat and two camping stoves like a magician who has planned better than her audience, and Diego appeared with a bag of blankets, the emergency kit of a man who believes in layers. Someone fetched the librarian\u2019s battery-powered lanterns and Maritza turned up like a patron saint with a stack of puzzles missing three pieces each, which is the correct number for community. Ivy sat on the floor with two children whose mother had closed her laptop with a look of absolution and taught them how to draw the floor plan of the shop with the light sources mapped like constellations. \u201cWhere does the warm live when the wires go quiet,\u201d she asked, and they pointed to each other and then to their own chests like small scientists confirming an unlikely theory.\n\nThe airport went hushed in the snow in that eerie way a place made for motion can be arrested and look like prayer. The sky above Burke was a blank page that no one had the nerve to write on. Ivy stood at her window after the soup at Jess\u2019s had been ladled and eaten and held the bowl of her house in her hands. The spruces gathered snow into themselves in white epaulettes; the cut on the one branch wore a pure line of white that looked like a new part rather than an absence. The foxglove had gone dark and quiet, a royal in exile. A cardinal shook himself like someone arriving and was briefly ridiculous and then dignified again. In the silence, she imagined planes landing in places where the government clears them a path and watched her own breath make small temporary clouds. For once the sky\u2019s indifference did not feel like an insult. It felt like a vacation for her nerves.\n\nJanuary asked for promises, and people lied or told tart little truths to their journals. Ivy bought a new calendar because she liked the way months pretended to behave when you put them in boxes. On the first Sunday of the year she wrote call Dad\u2019s friend about the Shakespeare in a slanted hand that looked like it had been to the future and reported back. When their father died, the truck had been sold to a man who liked the idea of it. He had kept the glove compartment book because he said he believed in respecting a talisman, but he hadn\u2019t read it because reading the car\u2019s heart had felt like a trespass. He met Ivy and Ruth at a diner in Lorton that made pancakes like quilts, and he handed over the small battered volume with both hands like it might buck. Ivy put her fingers on the place where their father had written his name in a hand that always looked tipped forward, as if letters for him were running to be heard. They ate their pancakes like a sacrament, with too much syrup and equal amounts of grief. For a moment, in the chrome light of the booth, their father was a person they had built together out of elbows and stories and not a man who had left them too soon to their own wiring.\n\nThe conference video circulated well beyond what she could tolerate watching and then simmered down into the file of \u201cThings People Say We Did\u201d that Maritza kept with the optimism of a record-keeper whose records were always worth keeping. A small library in West Virginia wrote to ask if Ivy would come and do her talk there in the spring, and the ask landed like a bird on the wire inside her\u2014the kind of bird you do not scare away by looking too directly. She wrote back with the truth she was practicing: I am honored. I am also a person who is not flying for a while. If enough people agreed, she could consider driving. The librarian wrote back: We have biscuits. It is a six-hour drive but the scenic route is better. We can pay gas and a small stipend and send you home with jam. The honesty of that felt like a hand without a glove. She left the email starred and did not say yes or no, which counts as discipline for a\nKeane.\n\nThe setback came stupidly, as setbacks will, elbowing its way into a day that had not done anything to deserve it. A story on the radio about a flight diverting for an \u201codor event\u201d lodged in her like a burr after a dog walk, and by the time she pulled into the driveway her heart was employing every employee in the factory for overtime. She sat with her hand on the wheel and forgot for a second how to be in a car, how to be in a body. She called Jess and did not say hello, which was their new permission, and Jess said, \u201cCount the greens,\u201d in a voice that sounded like a hammock. Ivy named the dashboard lights brave, turn signal confident, the moss in the crack by the windshield determined, the neighbor\u2019s recycle bin a shade of frog she could work with. By the time she got to the rosemary that was less green and more something else entirely, the world had righted itself, which is to say she could take her hand off the wheel and not believe she\u2019d fall out of herself. Later, when she told Dr. Sen, the therapist wrote on an index card in neat letters: You rode the horse through the puddle, and underlined the verb because verbs are where the living is.\n\nDiego\u2019s mother came to see the night garden one morning after a shift and spoke to Ivy with the courtesy of someone who had not planned to speak to anyone. Her English had the patience of a person who speaks two languages at work and a third in her head because there are some words for which no language is adequate. She touched the rosemary and said, \u201cMy extra time appointment is still the stairs,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cMine is the river,\u201d and they both looked toward the sky as if grateful and aggrieved. The moonflower had collapsed into a memory, brown and crumpled as an old fan, but the trellis stood like the bones of a promise. \u201cI hate small spaces that do not admit that they are small,\u201d Diego\u2019s mother said, and Ivy thought of the airport bathrooms, of the metal tubes pretending to be friendly. Before she left, the older woman pressed a small foil packet into Ivy\u2019s hand, a tamal still warm, and Ivy ate it at her counter with her head bent the way you bow without intending to, the masa sweet and the meat secret, and felt fed in a way that food rarely manages.\n\nOn a blue day so precise it felt like an equation, she drove to Gravelly Point and sat in the lot with other people who loved noise on purpose. A boy in a puffy jacket threw his arms up every time a plane came low and his father counted down like a launch, the two of them making joy into a homework assignment that anyone would have liked to complete. Ivy watched one land and then another, and the bodies of the planes looked like muscle memory, the tires kissing the ground with an honesty that surprised her every time. After a few, she opened the door and let the cold hit her straight in the chest, a slap that felt not unkind. She stood beside the car and let the shadow of a jet pass over her like a traveling thought, and when the sound came it shoved the air through her in a way that left her opened rather than broken. She thought she might cry\u2014out of fear or relief, she could not yet decide\u2014but her face stayed on the job and her eyes watered for their own boring reasons, and a kid clapped his mittened hands as if she were a trick. After the third plane she got back in the car and laughed in that breathless way of a person finding herself both ridiculous and fine. She texted Jess a photo of her sneaker toe on the painted white line of the parking lot and wrote: Under the path. Jess sent back a single teacup and then, after a second, a second teacup, because some jokes are better true.\n\nWinter gathered itself and unspooled. Ruth made herself take the elevator twice a week in a building where stairs had been hidden as if exercise were a shame, and called Ivy from between floors one day and whispered, \u201cIt sang,\u201d and Ivy whispered back, \u201cSinging is not always for us,\u201d and they both held the phones to their ears like shells and listened to the sea of the other\u2019s breath. Bryce arrived at the library with a report on Amelia Earhart that had a paragraph about getting lost that was so beautiful Ivy photocopied it and put it in her folder of reminders of why she does what she does. He had written, in a new hand: Maybe the world looks for us too. Amina cried quietly over a romance novel cover that finally understood that brown girls have more than one feeling, and surrendered the last nine percent of her disdain for the genre, a fraction Ivy believed deserved to be recorded. Mason bought a label maker and the labels proliferated into jokes, Jars, Jars II, Jars: The Reckoning, and then he labeled a drawer Fame and no one opened it because no one wanted to know what he had put inside fame.\n\nThere was a day, in mid-February, when the coffee shop\u2019s espresso machine finally decided to become art and stopped making coffee as a matter of conscience. Jess set a HAND-POURED ONLY sign that made people treat their orders like confessions. An airline pilot came in again with his cap in his elbow and a box of doughnuts with glossy icing that had not been made by anyone who cared about subtlety. He recognized Ivy, and his mouth made a consideration. \u201cYou from the other day,\u201d he said, and she nodded. \u201cHow\u2019s the, you know.\u201d He wiggled his fingers in the air like a magician who had forgotten the trick. She held a measuring spoon and said, \u201cVariable,\u201d and he grinned like a man who had watched weather for a living. He stood for a long minute and also did not say the word turbulence, which felt to Ivy like love. He told them without telling them a story about the way air sits over mountains like a pot cover and you have to slip the lid when steam gets big ideas. She did not hate him, not even a little bit.\n\nDr. Sen introduced, on a Tuesday with a fluorescent light that did not know how to be tender, the idea of a hierarchy that looked like a shopping list made by a careful person. Gravelly Point, check. Museum cut plane, check. Airport terminal without a ticket, stand and leave, check. Walk up to the glass at Reagan and let the smell of coffee and moving belts be annoying instead of mortal. Maybe\u2014this one placed in the margin like a whisper\u2014ride the shuttle bus from long-term parking to the terminal without getting off at any gate. \u201cWe\u2019ll call the bus a smart chair,\u201d Dr. Sen said, making a shape in the air that could have been a rectangle or a door or a possibility. \u201cYou sit in the thing that moves and you decide when you\u2019re done with deciding.\u201d Ivy nodded and thought of every shuttle she had ridden in the history of her life, all of them suddenly recast as comfortable beasts rather than traps.\n\nThey tried it on a day that felt like the inside of a paper bag. When the shuttle pulled up, its orange LED letters blinking SPECIAL EVENT as if the day were one, she stepped in and felt the floor bounce and then settle. The driver had a face like a story you don\u2019t tell until after dessert and drove with a competence that made her want to applaud. She sat by the window and watched the rows of cars go by like polite armies. The bus door sighed, the kneeling function announced itself with a whine, and people got on with luggage that revealed who they were better than their faces. A grandmother with a blanket that held the pattern of someone else\u2019s baby. A man who had packed like he feared the world would not have his brand of soap. A teen who wore ankle socks with cartoon eggs and stared at the floor with the intensity of a person negotiating a treaty with themselves. When the shuttle reached the loop and the glass mouth of the terminal yawned open, Ivy stayed seated and rode the circle back around. The driver glanced in the rearview, met her eyes in the way of someone who has seen everything and will make no news of the doing, and raised his hand in a little salute. On the third lap, she got off, stood under the overhang where everyone pretended to wait for someone else, and then got back on. She rode one more time for the principle of it. On the way home, she laughed at herself with less cruelty than she once would have employed.\n\nThe night-blooming garden slept in a way that made sleep look like a career. Diego showed up with a shovel over his shoulder one afternoon in a green so gray you could taste it, and said, \u201cThe school wants a demonstration garden. You will talk and I will do my impression of a responsible adult,\u201d and she said yes because she liked being the person people called when a room needed a sentence it didn\u2019t have yet. They stood with a trio of teachers in puffy coats that made them look like marshmallows with doctorate degrees, and Ines arrived with a roll of orange string and an air of command, and carved rectangles from the lawn with the delicacy of surgery. Ivy talked about roots and kids listened with the faces they reserve for information that may try to be relevant. She told them that seeds contain dark and later in equal amounts and that the trick is to wait for the later without burning the dark. She said it out loud and thought, without melodrama, that she was telling herself the same.\n\nOn a Sunday with a blue so insistent it felt paid for, Ruth asked Ivy to come to her office and meet the elevator without rancor. They stood in the marble lobby under a potted plant that had gotten too big for its own myths. Ruth pressed the button like a woman who had negotiated with worse and the elevator arrived with an apology. They got in and the doors shut and the feeling that you are made of cotton and electricity came, and Ivy watched the floor numbers tick and said in her head, kitchen table, spice drawer, bookshelf, rosemary, and the door opened and they were on eight. They got back in and rode to three and then up to ten and did not get out except once when a man with a suitcase and no patience needed their reality so he could do his. On the fourth ride, Ivy laughed in spite of herself at the ridiculousness of calling a box a dragon. Ruth laughed too. They did five rides and then went to Ruth\u2019s office and found a bowl of stale mints and pretended to enjoy them because sometimes pretending is politeness to the part of you that asks you to get into a moving thing and not die.\n\nIn late February a boy from Amina\u2019s chemistry class tried to impress her by making a volcano in the library with baking soda and vinegar he called a demonstration, and Ashlee from the front desk had to call building services with a voice that could sand wood. Ivy told him about how reactions sometimes need smaller bowls, and he looked at her as if she hadn\u2019t recognized the grandeur of his science, and later that week he brought her a note that said, in a penmanship that told the truth about his patience: Sorry I was extra. She kept it because the exactness of the language charmed her more than she liked being charmed by teenagers, which already happened too often for someone who wanted to be thought of as skeptical by at least one person per day.\n\nWind got up a tantrum in March. It leaned on the spruces like a boy in a bad mood and rattled the storm windows enough to make Ivy think of bolts again and then of how bolts, too, could be inspected. Maritza organized a small field trip to the Air and Space museum in the city for the older library kids because fairness demanded that if Ivy got to be brave, so did someone else. Amina refused to board the bus until she had a window seat and Mason brought snacks packaged like secrets. Bryce, now scaled up in both inches and opinion, sat across the aisle and read about Bernoulli with the suspicion of someone meeting an ancestor. In the exhibit with the planets hung like chandeliers, Ivy let the children walk ahead and stepped into a corner where the light dimmed on purpose. Her body did its scan like a TSA agent who had learned your habits and could be paternal about it, and this time she told herself a story that landed without injury. The story went like this: we are lucky and also terrified. The story went like this: other people built this and made it safe enough for me to loiter beside foolishness. When they were done, the bus breathed the kids back onto Burke like a gentle dragon, and Bryce, without preamble, said, \u201cDo you think birds think it\u2019s ridiculous that we try?\u201d and Ivy opened her mouth and then closed it because the answer mattered too much to be casual.\n\nThe ferry extended itself in April, offering a route up to Georgetown, and Jess texted at eight in the morning with a photo of the schedule and the words Misspent adulthood is a choice, and Ivy looked at her calendar and at the rosemary and at the pile of papers on the table that would be fine later, and said yes because saying yes had become a muscle she wanted to keep limber. The water was too cold for arrogance. The boat cracked through the air with a music that had gotten into her bones enough to feel helpful. The river was made of other rivers, and every time she looked toward the city she could see a different age, this one with fancy restaurants, that one with warehouses, another with canoes made by people who never called it the Potomac. The wind did what it wanted with her hair and she did not perform neatness. When they docked, they ate something on a stick from a food truck and laughed at men in suits whose feet were not prepared for cobbles. On the return trip, the wake behaved itself, the captain had the hands of someone who could make soup, and the afternoon took off its shoes.\n\nOne night, not long after, Ivy stood in her kitchen with the OKAY mug and looked at the glove compartment Shakespeare on the counter, the cover worn, the pages the color of cookies. She opened at random and found lines about mercy being twice blessed. She said them out loud, alone, with the force of a person who knows the audience is sometimes the room she stands in and whatever else is listening. She thought of the boy in Austin learning to like boats that did not steal. She thought of Kyle and his crutch and his embarrassed humility. She thought of Maritza writing More Reading, Less Apologizing and meaning it with all her cartilages. She thought of Jess with her burned hand and her braid and her opera singer machine. She thought of Diego on rooftops and in gardens and in rooms where grant applications asked him to put a number on his devotion and he tried anyway.\n\nIn bed that night, Burke\u2019s low orchestra of machines thrummed: refrigerators, the hum of people sleeping, the late plane angling for the runway with its belly lights, the heat knocking like a polite ghost. She lay on her back and put her hand on her chest and ran inventory: lungs, heart, muscle, the little faithful electricity that had not abandoned her even when she had thought she deserved the dark. She considered the fact of how far a person can go without leaving the county and thought it might be farther than she had been taught to admit. A map is a lie if it does not show the house. The day folded its corners and went into the drawer. She dreamed not of planes or ferries but of a long hallway with windows on one side and paintings on the other and her own footsteps a reliable drum, and in the morning she woke with the residue of the dream in her hair and did not shake it out.Chapter Ten\n\nBy the time the tulip poplars shook out their chartreuse fists and the creek in Burke learned its spring voice again, Ivy had stopped pretending that the invitation from West Virginia might evaporate. The email remained starred in her inbox like a polite dare. Fresh flyers for the library program curled slightly on the edges from humidity. The rosemary at her door had shrugged off winter with the smugness of a plant that never planned to die. On a Tuesday when the sky was the color of old paper and the planes moved like commas, she pressed call on the number in the email and told a woman named Nina that she would drive.\n\nNina laughed in a way that made biscuits seem inevitable. \u201cYou\u2019ll like the road better than you think,\u201d she said. \u201cIt forgives. And we are on the other end with jam and folding chairs that complain.\u201d\n\nDr. Sen approved the plan with the satisfaction of someone who enjoys a graph of progress and also knows better than to draw a straight line. She wrote a list on an index card in the tidy handwriting of a person whose pens never wander: coffee, map that is not a phone, two songs you can breathe to, a place you will pull over on purpose. \u201cIt is a ministry to future-you when present-you makes hammocks,\u201d she said, and Ivy went home and set the OKAY mug in the sink to dry like a superstition and packed the glove compartment with her father\u2019s battered Shakespeare because talismans enjoy continuity.\n\nRuth produced a fanny pack with the gravitas of a general issuing arms. \u201cSnacks. Dramamine you won\u2019t take. Bail money.\u201d She tucked in a small container of pistachios and the terrible mints from her desk for tradition. Jess, who felt abandoned by the notion of a day without their usual truce coffee, braided her hair excessively and tucked a note into Ivy\u2019s jacket pocket that said, in a looping, adolescent hand: If a bridge looks at you wrong, look back nicer.\n\nShe left at six in the morning, before Burke had decided on its mood. The car was a small room she liked, smelling faintly of oranges and old library glue. She drove past the rec center field where the goal nets hung like unmade beds and the spruces that had forgiven a winter\u2019s wind. At the end of the block, she made the kind of right turn that always felt like a conversation with destiny and breathed once out loud because it seemed polite to show the air what it was for.\n\nThe beltway unscrolled like a film strip that had been repaired one too many times. Down along the river, the morning made a show of itself on the water, flinging light like a toddler with glitter. She passed the airport, its glass faced toward the east, and gave it the respectful nod she might give a person she was not ready to make eye contact with. The road toward Leesburg was a long shrug. She took it. Somewhere outside Hamilton, the air turned into something you could drink. The land undulated in the controlled, practiced way of a person in a yoga class who has been doing yoga for years and refuses to brag about it.\n\nHarpers Ferry rose up in front of her like a fold in the map someone had smoothed and then reconsidered. The confluence of the rivers did their performance, brown and green braiding without asking for applause. Ivy parked on a street that made parallel parking look like a demonstration sport and got out to stand for a minute near a railing that someone had painted blue with half a heart. A train crossed the water on a trestle that looked too delicate and proved itself anyway. She felt the old flutter in the bones and told herself the story of how bridges hold because they are held. An older couple in denim jackets walked past, the man holding a dog that did not want to be carried the way you hold a baby that does not want a bath. \u201cMorning,\u201d the woman said, one of those southern syllables that leaves the mouth like a quilt. Ivy answered, added, \u201cThis is not a bad place to gather yourself,\u201d and the woman said, \u201cWhen the rivers comport themselves, I can behave myself.\u201d\n\nShe chose the scenic route like a person choosing an argument with herself and finding she liked the sound of her own case. The road began to collect trees that did not feel the need to apologize for their opinions. She was not fond of tunnels, and when the GPS\u2019s bland voice suggested a shortcut through rock she took the exit onto the old road that sidled around the mountain with a confidence that required none of hers. The car climbed and the horizon opened and the guardrails attempted to reassure. In a turnout with a view that instructed you to shut up, she pulled over on purpose because future-Ivy had been given that gift by present-Ivy. She ate half a pistachio and saw it for what it was\u2014an offering to the gods of small triumphs\u2014and then took two more because generosity can be taught.\n\nAt a diner that had not removed its Christmas lights in three years because nobody asked it to, she ate a biscuit that was an unapologetic part of the local religion and jam that had ideas about strawberries. The waitress called her honey without sarcasm. A man at the counter in a ball cap that had chosen its stains walked her through the proper route to avoid the one-wheeled road work. \u201cThey\u2019re improving a bridge that isn\u2019t broke,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love to punish what hasn\u2019t failed yet.\u201d He asked where she was headed, and when she told him a library name he nodded, a man who believed in buildings with quiet hours. He did not ask why she was going. She did not offer to explain.\n\nThe library in West Virginia was a brick promise held up by mismatched pillars. Inside, the floor gave a little in the spots everyone used. Banners in construction paper and ambition draped above the circulation desk. A girl of about nine with hair arranged to suggest blueberry pie handed Ivy a name tag made in a careful hand that had decided what an I should look like and stuck with it. Nina materialized with a professional\u2019s arms full of clipboards and a face that suggested she wanted everyone to feel like they had done a brave thing by coming. She smelled like flour and toner. \u201cJam,\u201d she announced, leading Ivy as if they were running a gentle heist, and held up a jar with a handwritten label that read, Summer, saved.\n\nThe room filled in the way rooms do when everyone has been taught to sit down before the story starts. A man with suspenders that insisted on their job. Two teenagers accompanied by their grudges and their respective grandmothers. A woman who had a baby sleeping on her chest in the way that says the day will go as it wishes. In the second row, a boy wore a T-shirt with a plane on it that made Ivy\u2019s ribs do their honest tap dance and then quiet. When Nina introduced her, it was with the sentence Ivy had come to believe might be the kindest to give a person: \u201cShe is learning something and wanted to tell you about it while it was still learning.\u201d\n\nShe spoke. She tried to use the words care and map and small without making them feel like a cop-out. She told them about the boy who wanted to go big at home and the girl who drew a river that knew exactly where it was going until it ran out of blue crayon. She told them about the ferry that did not pretend to be the sky, and the night-blooming garden that refused to show off for anyone who didn\u2019t wait. She said, \u201cSometimes courage does not want its picture taken,\u201d and in the front row, a woman in a T-shirt advertising a hardware store said \u201camen,\u201d not loudly, but with the muscle of that word behind it. When she told them the teacups sentence, which had become both a joke and a sacrament, someone near the back held up an actual ceramic cup as if they had been waiting for authorization.\n\nAfter, a man who had lived seventy-two years in the county asked whether it was a kind of sin to have never left. Ivy thought of all the maps that leave out the house and said, \u201cIf your feet and your attention have traveled, the world has been moved,\u201d which was a line she had not heard before it arrived in her mouth. The boy in the plane T-shirt lingered until everyone had taken their jam and their folding chairs had concluded their complaints. He handed her a drawing of a plane that looked less like a machine and more like the idea of a bird wearing a necklace. \u201cI like the shuttle,\u201d he said, his voice slanted so that sarcasm could not find it, \u201cthe one that looks burned because it worked.\u201d She nodded and asked him what he thought fire learned when it made marks and he said, \u201cNot to brag,\u201d and she thought of the tiles, those squares of stubborn.\n\nThe road back did not hold anything against her. In a town that also had a street named Main, she stopped at a small airport with a sign that said Visitors Welcome in a font of a certain faith. It was a runway with an opinion and a line of hangars that had decided not to be glamorous. A man with a face that sun had not asked permission of leaned on a propeller that did not look like a piece of violence in that light. He had the taste of aviation in his vowels. In the lounge, which was a room with folding chairs and a coffee maker that had its own calendar, a woman in a windbreaker with a stitched name offered Ivy coffee like a doctor offering pills. \u201cYou flying?\u201d the woman asked, as if that was a thing people often were. \u201cNo,\u201d Ivy said, and then, because the word felt like a lie when the air tasted this friendly, \u201cNot today.\u201d\n\nThe flight instructor had a way of standing with his feet apart as if the ground might try something. He asked nothing that required a biography. \u201cYou want to sit?\u201d he said, gesturing toward a Cessna that had been built with more sincerity than glamour. The door opened with a sound like permission, and she climbed in because her body had been trained by a woman with bracelets to try a door when it is open. The cockpit smelled like dust with credentials. The headset hung there like an old idea. The world outside was a model; a truck moved through a small choreography on the road beyond the fence. She put her hands in her lap because she did not want to touch a thing that meant it. The instructor pointed with two fingers at the yoke and said, \u201cSome people think it wants to be gripped. Turns out it likes a confident hand that doesn\u2019t insist.\u201d She nodded because she had lived with fear that was the opposite of that. Her breath did the horse and then did the thing horses do when they realize the barn is not on fire. She stayed three minutes and then seven and then a small while longer than she would have believed possible the year before, and when she climbed down her legs behaved.\n\nBack in Burke the dogwoods put up their little handkerchiefs, and Mason lined the bulletin board with fliers that had fonts so aligned they could have gone out in public unashamed. The rain garden at the high school found its own purpose quickly; a storm came and the hole filled, and the boys in hoodies watched water behave itself and had the decency to applaud. Ines labeled a second round of plants with a wicked joy, sneaking Latin into people\u2019s heads like contraband. Bryce began to like footnotes and then pretended not to, and Amina rolled her eyes the exact number of times required to maintain her identity while sneaking audiobooks like snacks.\n\nThe bridge in the park\u2014the small footbridge over the part of the creek that liked to jump its banks without warning\u2014had been taken from the graveyard of bureaucratic ideas and returned to use. It was not much, which is what made it dignified. On a Saturday that thought about rain and decided against it, people gathered to call it good news. Kyle stood at an awkward angle that made his crutch unnecessary and also made habit hard to break, and read from a piece of paper he had written in block letters. He said things like stewardship and partnership and residents, and then he looked up and said, \u201cWe decided not to punish what isn\u2019t failing,\u201d which is the kind of sentence a man should be congratulated for saying out loud into a microphone. Maritza held a ribbon that had been cut by children before and had the nicks to show it. Jess refused the scissors and handed them to Ivy, turning her gently toward the creek. \u201cYou are our hinge,\u201d she whispered, as if it were a recipe you couldn\u2019t write down.\n\nThey called it the Hinge. It was not official\u2014no plaque\u2014just the way the people who used it decided to refer to it in sentences that were shorthand for care. Diego and a small crew of teenagers, some of whom believed in plants and some of whom believed in Diego, had tucked sedges and blue flag iris into the mud near the abutments. The plants looked like commas, not yet insisting on their point. Children chalked maps down the path to the kiosk where Mason had stationed a folding table with clipboards because nothing in the world made him happier than handing someone an important rectangle. Ivy cut the ribbon in a line, not with flourish, the way you cut the twine on a box you hope contains something that will not make more work for you. The creek approved in its fashion, throwing itself politely at the rocks and then reconsidering.\n\nAt the library, Nina from West Virginia wrote to say that two kids had stayed after the talk to draw teacups and label them with bravery. She attached a photo of the jam shelf, now with a new line of jars labeled Later in black Sharpie. Ivy printed the email and put it in her folder with Bryce\u2019s paragraph about being found by the world. The folder grew to the thickness of a thin book and she wondered whether a person\u2019s competence could be measured in paper.\n\nDr. Sen\u2019s index cards gathered into a small, stern stack. The next one suggested a reconnaissance mission to the airport terminal without the magic trick of the shuttle bus\u2014walk in under the glass, smell the coffee and the moving belt optimism, buy gum you don\u2019t need, watch people find their gates, leave when you decide the leaving. Jess offered to go and then took it back without Ivy asking, saying she would rather be the person who waited at a table with two chairs. Ivy went on a Thursday morning when the air had the quality of paper after a too-hot bath. The parking garage clicked past like cards in a dealer\u2019s hand. The sign that read Terminal had the confidence of a pronouncement. The automatic doors took her without asking permission and the cool inside air laid a hand on her arm like a nurse. It smelled like coffee and someone else\u2019s anxiety. She put her fingertips on the railing of the escalator and refused to think about hands. A family with matching T-shirts that read Cousin Trip placed themselves around her like human padding; a toddler in a stroller wore a hat like an orange boat and brandished a spoon.\n\nShe stood by a pillar and read the sign that told you what to do with your baggage if you had made one reservation and then thought better of it. She watched a woman in a suit who had learned how to walk and talk at the speed of commerce break off from her phone long enough to kiss a child\u2019s head. She watched two twenty-year-olds wearing backpacks the size of idiocy argue about a snack they had not bought and then hug, their anger turned to relief with the speed of youth. She watched a man in a wheel chair receive the kind of attention all bodies should receive on neutral days. She breathed two acceptable breaths and then one that startled her, and the horse inside her looked at her over its shoulder because it had learned she could be trusted sometimes. She bought gum and threw it away later, a ritual that pleased some mean spirit in her who liked waste to be implicated in healing. She left without announcing it to anyone and sat in her car and put her head down on the steering wheel like someone at a revival from a faith without a name. \u201cLater,\u201d she said to herself and to the sky and to the small singing sound the exit barrier made when it lifted.\n\nThe foxglove in her yard germinated in half a dozen unlikely places, ringing small future bells in soil she had not remembered disturbing. Diego claimed credit for the extent to which the garden had decided to look deliberate, which charmed her because it meant he wanted to be responsible for good accidents. He had a teenager following him like a shadow\u2014Carlos, with a mustache determined to audition for permanence\u2014who listened with an attention Ivy found rare in boys and more rare in those with phones. Carlos paused by the Hinge to take a sequence of photographs at dawn and then sent them to Ivy without comment, the creek in those images making a promise she would hold it to.\n\nMay pushed its sleeves up and applied itself to its work. The kids at the library turned in projects that betrayed their parents\u2019 sleeplessness and their own glitter loyalties. Amina began her annual period of pretending the end of school did not matter while buying three new black eyeliners that absolutely mattered. Mason put a countdown on the staff whiteboard and then erased it because watching numbers become smaller made him edgy about endings. Maritza convinced the county to let her open the big meeting room on Fridays for something called Quiet Riot, a name that pleased her so much she laughed every time she wrote it in an email. In the room, teenagers lay on the carpet and read and pretended not to notice that other teenagers they had decided to want were reading in proximity, and sometimes one of them would fall asleep and snore and then wake up embarrassed and an old woman in the genealogy section would clap twice quietly, their communal grandmother.\n\nRuth began to dream disturbingly mundane dreams about office chair casters and woke to find herself grateful to be bored in that way. She and Ivy chose a Sunday to drive to the Shenandoah, to watch the river be itself without making metaphors of it. They stood at an overlook where a historical plaque told the truth about fighters and victors and someone had carved a heart into the wooden rail with a tool that had wanted to be a knife when it grew up. Ruth put her hand on the carved heart as if it had a pulse, and Ivy said, \u201cHe would have liked the curve,\u201d and they both meant their father, who had believed in vistas as proof that suffering lacked imagination.\n\nThe city announced the water taxi schedule to Georgetown with optimism matched by the weather, and Jess, refusing to accept that adulthood meant being sensible about weeknights, devised a plan that involved a boat, a late dinner, and the kind of walk that convinces blisters to become character. The boat yielded to them the way it does for those who have introduced themselves correctly\u2014firm handshake, no boasting. They ate skewered things on a bench at the edge of water that had ideas about both past and future. On the way back, the air laid its cool across the back of Ivy\u2019s neck in a way that made sleep, later, feel like a gift she did not have to pay for. A plane came in high and busy. She watched it without inventing a backstory for the pilot or the person in 23A. She let it be a moving light, yelling without volume, and it was good enough.\n\nIn early June, Nina sent a photo of a new library sign\u2014hand-painted letters that said Courage is a trickle, and the artist had made a caricature teacup that looked more like a boot. Ivy laughed and then cried and then laughed because her body had decided to enjoy its new capacity for both-and. The West Virginia boy in the plane T-shirt wrote a postcard with a picture of a bridge and an arrow pointing at it labeled This does not move and that is fine. She put it on the fridge next to the cow in boots and the OKAY magnetized into place.\n\nThe county fair arrived in \u201970s colors and sounds arranged by parents who once believed in arcades and cotton candy. Ivy did not intend to go. She found herself walking anyway after dinner when the sky made a promise she didn\u2019t require it to keep. The Ferris wheel turned itself simple on the horizon. Jess appeared with a bag of kettle corn big enough to shelter a small child and offered it like a sacrifice. Diego showed up seconds later from a different direction because towns have the same gravity at night, with Ines and Carlos in tow, and Ines rolled her eyes at the suspect watering practices of a sad set of potted geraniums near a concession stand. They ambled the way people do when the alternative is to go home and clean a thing that does not need cleaning.\n\nThey stood beneath the Ferris wheel as cars rose and lowered like breathing, watching the line of people who had consented to the idea. A gentleman of a certain confidence offered to let them cut in because he had four teenaged boys and had achieved benevolence by sheer survival; they declined. Ivy looked up and did the inventory she had learned to do\u2014bolts, joints, repetition, the notches that hold, the bored teenage operator who knows the music before it plays\u2014and felt the sharp in her ribs that had learned to be more interesting than simply pain. \u201cNot today,\u201d she said to the tilt of her blood and to Jess\u2019s braid and to the thin cloud that had landed over the moon like a joke. \u201cEvery day we decide something,\u201d Jess said, popping a kernel into her mouth with religious fervor. \u201cYou chose the ground and I am not mad at it.\u201d Diego pointed to a set of prize-winning hogs with a tenderness that suggested the beginning of a folk song and then bought lemonade and handed Ivy the first sip in an act so simple it rearranged some small thing you would have to be an instrument to hear.\n\nSummer moved in with the arrogance of someone bringing a duffel and no rent money. The library filled with the bureaucracy of fun. Maritza discovered a grant for mobile shelves and Mason designed a schedule that made block parties look like foreplay. Amina convinced three teen volunteers to read a romance by giving them each the task of finding the argument that made the kiss necessary; two wrote papers and one pretended not to care but returned the book with a page creased at exactly the right place. Bryce, taller and slightly gentled by his own growth, came to Ivy with news of a summer program for kids who like to build bridges with popsicle sticks and real math. He stood in the doorway and failed at casual. \u201cI applied,\u201d he said, looking at a spot two inches to the left of her face. \u201cI told them I am good at pretending bridges work until they do.\u201d She turned her head so his eyes landed where they might mean to and said, \u201cYou are.\u201d\n\nThe footbridge\u2014Hinge\u2014became background even in its newness, which is to say it had done its job perfectly. Parents stood on it with cups of coffee and argued in voices softened by the sound of water. Children ran across it like deadline met. Teenagers lingered at its center pretending not to be in love. One evening, Ivy went there alone because it was the end of a day that had asked for one more thing and she had refused it on purpose. She leaned both her forearms on the railing and looked hard at the rock where on some days a turtle came to moralize with its presence. A plane tugged at the sky toward the airport, the red light blinking a Morse code she did not need to translate. She raised two fingers toward it because small ceremonies have decided to adopt her. The creek pushed itself over a shallow tongue of stone and made a sound that could have been language if you wanted it to be. Behind her, someone\u2019s wind chime insisted and then apologized and then insisted again.\n\nWhen she went home, there was a flyer stuck to her door with blue painter\u2019s tape because the town refused to give up its delivery method. It was for the opening of the school rain garden, with the students listed as if they had played starring roles in a film. Ines\u2019s name was there with a small crown drawn above it by someone who knew better than to pretend she was not in charge. On the fridge, the magnets conspired to make a small museum: the cow in boots, the OKAY mug picture, the boy\u2019s bridge and its caption not moving as a virtue, a shopping list that included laundry soap, an unreadable scribble that she thought might be remind pirates they can swim. She added a line, or let it add itself through her, the way some sentences arrive: drive west again. Under it, as if to temper the ambition, she wrote in small letters, rosemary, lemon, teacups, and then she went to bed with the window cracked and the fan spinning like a well-meaning argument. The night did what it does, which is to collect and give back in equal measures, and somewhere over the county line a plane took off with its small intentions and did not ask her to approve.\n\nThe rain garden opening took place under a sky that felt like a lesson in being generous without flooding. The principal wore a tie decorated with pencils and the calm of a man who had learned to move chairs without anyone asking. The strip of former lawn had transformed into a polite swamp that looked as if it had always intended to be useful. Purple spikes of iris nodded as if they were considering office hours. Labels, required by Ines\u2019s personal constitution, told the truth about Latin and lineage. The teenagers stood with their hands in their pockets, a stance that means triumph and terror in equal measure. Diego said, \u201cWater in a hurry should learn to slow down somewhere,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cSo should we,\u201d and someone from the county took a picture that would be put into a newsletter no one would read and that would make the work look small; the living thing under it would make that a lie.\n\nJuly arrived with the smell of asphalt and sunscreen and the particular joy of the air-conditioning that breaks and then, hallelujah, returns. Ivy applied her list-making to the program days the way a person applies salve to a burn, with tenderness and insistence. The ferry ran its route like a metronome. Jess\u2019s machine threw only one tantrum and was coaxed back by someone rubbing the gasket with olive oil named after a saint. The boy in Austin sent a drawing of a ferry with a pull-out section labeled therapist, and she laughed and put it above the stove where steam could give it a benign wave.\n\nOn a day too hot for metaphor, Ivy drove again to the small airport with the windblown lounge and walked, without making a plan, toward the fence where you can stand and watch the runway without being interesting to security. The Cessnas waggled their wings and the brothers of the Cessnas did their gentleman\u2019s taxi. The flight instructor from the spring lifted a hand as if he had been expecting her and then went on tugging a wheel like a dull kindness. She put her fingers through the chain link and did not think of prison. She thought of nets. She watched a student pilot float higher than her intentions and then remember them, bumping the ground with a humility she recognized. She stayed until she felt the small loosening that told her she had done the correct amount of exposure for a Thursday. In the tiny shop that sold things like earplugs and improbable romance between airplanes and calendars, she bought a patch with a plane embroidered in such bad color she adored it, and later at home she sewed it into the lining of her jacket where only she would know it lived.\n\nAt night, when the crickets had not yet given themselves to August\u2019s competition and the heat pressed like an attention-seeking cat, she lay on her back on the rug of her front room and watched the ceiling fan do its dignified job. The house breathed with her, the lath behind the plaster making its small nocturnal noises of accommodation. Somewhere a teenager laughed in a way that made a parent check their watch. The foxglove slept with the arrogance of the entirely necessary. The rosemary turned its small spines toward the window and held the smell of courage like a gossip it would never share. She thought of a line deep in the sonnets about exile and mercy, and she decided not to go find it, trusting instead that it would arrive when it needed to. The day had not asked her to get on a plane. She had not been required to be a spectacle for her own bravery. The ground had matched her feet, and that matching made a kind of music she was just beginning to hear. She closed her eyes with a practiced immodesty and let sleep do the work it wanted to do\u2014repair, archive, erase, and leave a few files open for morning when she would stand again at the rosemary and say, because she enjoyed the stubbornness of habits that do no harm, \u201cOkay.\u201d",

San Antonio last spring? You were a dream.\u201d But it was March now, the kind that came into Burke with thin rain and a fretful cold wind, and Ivy Keane had been awake since two in the morning listening to her own heart skate and skid in her chest. She had said yes to a family in Austin because she always said yes\u2014you didn\u2019t build a private tutoring practice by doing only the easy things\u2014and she had driven herself to Reagan National and parked on the third level and found it impossible to breathe in the elevator.\n\nHer throat closed like a fist. The hum of the fluorescent lights cut her into pieces.\n\nShe remembered the blonde boy in Austin, a fifth-grader who\u2019d traced the lines of his reading textbook with his finger like a cartographer, the hesitant turn of his lips when a sentence finally made sense, the soft snort he tried to swallow when she told him her grandfather used to keep Shakespeare in the glove compartment of his truck like a talisman. She had promised him they would read Treasure Island next because he thought pirates should get therapy and she had laughed until she cried. She had meant to go back. She had meant to go everywhere.\n\nBut at Gate C23, between a vending machine that offered strange gentle things\u2014coconut water, a protein bar whose ingredients read like a science lesson\u2014and a plastic plant in a beige pot, the world seemed to tilt. The plane at the window grew larger and also farther away. The floor was too low or she was too high. Every tapping foot in the waiting area was a metronome turned up too loud. A woman in a navy blazer called pre-boarding and a young man with a bright neck pillow slung around his shoulders like a floatation device shuffled to the front. Ivy didn\u2019t stand.\n\nShe thought of the 737\u2019s door sealing like a cave. She thought of the air above West Virginia, black and empty. She thought, We are only held up by promises and good manners. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d she said, and then a stranger was at her elbow with a firm palm pressed to her back. No one asked why. Or maybe someone did. She doesn\u2019t remember answers, only her tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth like an old stamp.\n\nThe gate agent\u2019s smile wavered and then collapsed into something blank. \u201cYou sure?\u201d she said, but it was a performance.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Ivy said again, and her chest seemed to seize. \u201cI\u2019ll take a train.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo Austin?\u201d The agent\u2019s eyebrows climbed like cautious spiders.\n\n\u201cThen I can\u2019t go,\u201d Ivy said, and she started to cry in the silliest way, just drops, not the cinematic flood that would have made it worth the trouble.\n\nThey printed her a refund voucher that folded into a brochure about calm breathing and she walked out of the airport on slow feet, past fliers about a community choir and a lost set of keys with a brass duck attached. Outside, the air smelled like damp asphalt and jet fuel, a tender, poison perfume. A plane thundered low overhead and her knees went loose. She made it to her car, rested her forehead against the steering wheel, and thought of every decision she had made. There was a cardinal on the railing in front of her, its red a foolish blot in the gray, its beak opening and closing like a tiny hinge.\n\nBy the time she pulled into her driveway in Burke, the rain had thinned to a mist. Her townhouse had a square brick face and shutters that a previous owner had painted a cheerful, unfashionable green. The front garden had been angry at being neglected for years until the winter before, when she hired Diego from a number scribbled on a postcard at the farmer\u2019s market. He didn\u2019t talk much at first. He turned the soil and in his gloved hands the land looked like cake batter. He planted rosemary by the step because he said everyone should crush their fingers in something fragrant as they go out into the world. Ivy had believed him because she needed to believe in something she could keep alive.\n\nShe texted the family in Austin\u2014her apologies, her mortification, her promise to arrange a colleague to go in her place. She sat on the stairs just inside her front door and listened to the house. The radiator had a small clank that sounded like someone dropping cutlery very far away. There was a letter on the hallway table from her HOA about the spruces that leaned toward the common lawn: a stern little paragraph about encroachment, as if the trees were misbehaving children.\n\nHer phone kept chiming. A friend sent a sympathetic string of hearts and one of those smile faces with a tear. Her sister, Ruth, did not text immediately, which meant a call was coming. Ivy made tea and put her phone on the counter like a volatile reagent. The kettle shrieked. The rosemary by the door let out a breath when she brushed by.\n\nWhen the phone rang, it was the old barn owl sound she\u2019d set ages ago for family. She held the mug to her mouth and burned her upper lip because she couldn\u2019t think, because she wanted to be punished maybe, a little.\n\n\u201cYou missed your flight,\u201d Ruth said. Not hello. Not are you okay. The way some people ask questions the way they break bread, ready to share, it was not how Ruth spoke. She worked in federal procurement and liked things that were antidotes to chaos.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t miss it, I refused it,\u201d Ivy said, a little aggressively, as if it would be better to be the author of her failing.\n\nThere was a silence and then the soft click of Ruth\u2019s jaw over a mint. \u201cIs that supposed to make me feel better?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about you feeling anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a tutor, Ivy. If you can\u2019t get on planes, that\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have cars,\u201d she said, and knew it was stupid. \u201cWindows. Trains. I can Zoom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou hate Zoom. Everyone hates Zoom.\u201d A rustle, perhaps paper. Ivy imagined her sister in her office, even though it was Saturday, because no matter where Ruth was she sat like a person who could sign a form and make a road appear. \u201cLook, I know it\u2019s inconvenient. But plenty of people get nervous and do it anyway.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nerves,\u201d Ivy said, though maybe it was. \u201cIt\u2019s like my blood recedes. It\u2019s like I\u2019m a building and the person who pays the electricity bill packed up and left.\u201d\n\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Ruth said without humor. \u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cSolve it,\u201d Ivy said, and felt foolishly brave for saying so. When she hung up, the bravery collapsed like a packing box.\n\nShe didn\u2019t leave the house that day. She said she was taking the weekend to \u201ctake stock,\u201d an old lady thing, but it fit. Her father used to use the term for their pantry when he got the notion to be a single parent who cooked two nights in a row. There would be lists. There would be the weighing of soup cans and finding out the milk had gone quietly wrong.\n\nBy Monday, the fear had followed her into strange places. She couldn\u2019t walk under the big billboard on Braddock Road because the metal groaned and she thought of bolts loosening. She couldn\u2019t swallow easily when a commercial for an airline came on between news segments and she had to leave the room during an interview with a pilot who smiled like a toothpaste advertisement and said the word turbulence as if it were a cousin who sometimes drank too much at weddings.\n\nShe tried to tell someone. The someone she chose was not random. It was Jess, who ran the coffee shop on Ox Road with the chalkboards and the slow baristas you forgave for their slowness because their hands were tenderly theatrical with the milk frothing. Jess had been a pianist once and still had the posture. She wore hair that had gone mostly white in a braid down her back like a rope pulled tight, but her mouth was soft. She had been Ivy\u2019s first client when she moved back to Burke from Richmond four years ago. Jess\u2019s son had needed homework hacking and somebody who would sit in a kitchen with eyes that said I can wait until you emerge from your teenage cave and maybe bring you soup. That son had graduated last May and now did something with sustainable soils.\n\n\u201cI froze at the gate,\u201d Ivy said while the espresso machine hissed like a sleeping cat dream. \u201cI was back in the crowd with my little suitcase, looking like a girl in a painting called Woman Who Pretends Nothing Is Wrong.\u201d\n\nJess pulled a shot, glanced up, her eyebrows knitting. \u201cYou\u2019re allowed to freeze.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not, though. If I freeze, there\u2019s a dad in a beltway condo who says I\u2019m not worth the invoice and he\u2019s right. There\u2019s a kid in Austin who wondered why I went away and didn\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you apologize. You did. You don\u2019t need to punish yourself forever.\u201d Jess had a way of placing words down like coasters. \u201cYou can also not fly for a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will think I\u2019m dramatic. Ruth thinks I\u2019m being dramatic. She thinks I should just\u2014\u201d Ivy made a movement with her hand like slipping between pages.\n\nJess set the espresso on the counter, wiped the wand, softened her voice. \u201cYou don\u2019t live in her head. Besides, this town\u2013\u201d She gestured at the glass window where the weather had made a watercolor of the parking lot. \u201cI see more astronauts on toddlers\u2019 shirts than I see astronauts. People love flight as an idea. They also think courage is a faucet you turn on when you want. It isn\u2019t. Sometimes it\u2019s a trickle and you spend your life catching it in teacups.\u201d\n\nIvy wanted to cry. Jess had that effect on people. It was annoying. \u201cWhat if it never comes back?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhat if it does?\u201d Jess said, and moved on to a customer who needed change like he needed absolution.\n\nShe picked up extra local clients to make up the shortfall. Some of them were gentle dentists whose children smelled like bleach and bubblegum and had science fairs looming like comets. Some of them were lawyers who thought of their kids as evidence. The week the Howard girl needed a mock oral presentation and couldn\u2019t stand up without her knees clapping, Ivy sat on the floor with her and whispered until the words eased out. The office smelled like eucalyptus from a diffuser and there were awards on every shelf. Mrs. Howard, who wore boots that cost as much as Ivy\u2019s old Honda, said, \u201cI read there\u2019s a therapist who puts people in virtual reality airplane seats. Very effective.\u201d The tone was something like helpful, something like a dare.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of pixels,\u201d Ivy said, trying to make it light.\n\n\u201cI thought you were\u2014\u201d Mrs. Howard did a thing with her head. \u201cYou know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can be many things,\u201d Ivy said, and it sounded like a plea. On her way out, she pressed three fingers into a spiky succulent, as if it would offer a blessing.\n\nOn Thursday, Diego came by for the first spring clean. He arrived barefoot inside his work boots, which Ivy only knew because he took them off at the door and you could see his toes wiggle inside the socks before he slid into a pair of garden clogs that looked like a cartoonist\u2019s idea of shoes. He had the particular smell of someone who spent enough time outside that weather clung to him like a faithful pet. He wore a wool hat that had seen better winters and his eyebrows were thick and cheerful. Diego did not ask questions like Jess did and that was also a kindness because those days Ivy was tired of being the main character in her panic.\n\n\u201cYou want me to pull the spruces back?\u201d he said, tapping the letter from the HOA with two fingers as if it were a card he could win with.\n\n\u201cI want you to tell the HOA to come over here and talk to the trees like they\u2019re old men at a deli,\u201d Ivy said, and Diego smiled with half his mouth.\n\nHe worked while she sorted textbooks in her dining room and made stacks that collapsed almost immediately because it turned out she couldn\u2019t remember her own system; she reorganized her reorganizing. It had always been a life built of small useful things: highlighters in three colors, Post-its like flaky pastries, the good kind of binder clips that didn\u2019t bruise the paper. She stacked flashcards like a card dealer. She respected the small engine of a child\u2019s brain. She could find a metaphor for reading comprehension in the way clouds drifted. Up to now the tasks had spooled out in front of her with a steady hum. Today the table looked like she had spilled herself and there were no rags big enough.\n\nDiego knocked on the sliding door with the back of his hand, a polite clunk. He had soil on his cheek like a birthmark. \u201cDo you want to keep the lamb\u2019s ear? It\u2019s mean this winter. They look tired.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that they feel like tongues,\u201d she said. \u201cKeep a few, maybe. Put the rest in somebody else\u2019s sun.\u201d\n\nHe nodded, then leaned on the door frame. \u201cYou look like you\u2019re trying to convince a mouse to come out of the wall with raisins.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am the mouse,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cEverything is the wall.\u201d\n\nDiego nodded in that way he had that made you feel as if he had been a therapist in a previous life but that it hadn\u2019t paid as well as fixing fences. He told her a story about a woman who had once asked him to plant only flowers that would bloom at night because she worked the midnight shift and needed beauty when she came home. \u201cSo we did jasmine and the moonflower, and now when you stand in her driveway at ten p.m., it\u2019s like standing in a memory. It\u2019s busy. Good busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you ever fear\u2026anything?\u201d Ivy asked, surprising herself, and Diego took off his hat and rubbed the place where it had pressed a ring.\n\n\u201cSnakes,\u201d he said. \u201cHeights. Love. All the common things.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre snakes common?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this county? Friend, snakes are an inevitability. Love too.\u201d\n\nIvy laughed, and it turned into a hiccup that hurt her chest. In the silence that followed, a plane bumbled across the sky and her hands started their familiar cold. She didn\u2019t hide it well. Diego\u2019s gaze flicked to her mouth and then away.\n\n\u201cMy mother won\u2019t go in elevators,\u201d he said, as if to offer a story sturdy enough to carry them both. \u201cShe will if there\u2019s no choice. If she\u2019s late for a test or a job interview. But usually she takes the stairs. She calls it her extra time appointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds expensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime?\u201d He shrugged. \u201cYou pay or you pay. Sometimes you pay in other ways. You are the boss of you, yes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a bossy sister.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the oldest of four. My sister tells me what to do like she invented the telling.\u201d\n\nHe went back out to the garden and Ivy stood still until the plane faded like an insult. She exhaled, long and slow like Jess had once shown her, counting in a way that made numbers more like prayer beads than like math. It didn\u2019t cure it. It didn\u2019t vanish. But for a second she did not feel like a building with no lights.\n\nIn the evening, after Diego left and the rosemary held a little rain in its green, she made soup without a recipe. She put in lentils and carrots and most of an onion and a fistful of parsley, and when the pot burped she stirred the bottom to make sure nothing stuck. She ate standing at the window, watching a man walk his dog past the spruces, the leash glittering with rain. She thought of burning bridges and building bridges and the drama of both. She thought of the first student who hired her on her own, a thirteen-year-old who\u2019d found her website and sent a message that read, \u201cI would like to learn how to not look dumb,\u201d and Ivy had written back, \u201cYou already know. It\u2019s not a class.\u201d The girl had what Ivy had, a nervous system that thought it was smarter than the rest of the body. But they had coaxed it. They had coaxed it with ridiculous jokes and easy wins and occasionally a good cry and now that girl was applying to film school in Chicago, a city Ivy used to go to often. She pictured their map of the United States, all threads and pins. All those places that now seemed unreachable.\n\nThe news blared, a man in a tie telling a story about weather as if it were politics, and then there was footage of a plane promising cheap fares, a holiday somewhere with water so blue it hurt the eye. She turned the television off. She locked the doors even though Burke had the kind of crime that happened in meetings and left quietly, polite as a dentist. She fell asleep with her hand on her stomach and dreamed she was on a ferry. This was an improvement.\n\nIn the morning the world was swollen and sarcastically bright. Burke had a way of being pretty when it wanted to apologize for being itself. The sky wore swaths of blue, and the trees were still gaunt but domesticated. On such a morning one might be forgiven for believing in resilience like a coupon you could redeem.\n\nShe taught a session in a pewter farmhouse in Clifton with a girl who wanted to fall in love with fractions, who said, \u201cThey seem petty,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cThey are petty, so be more petty,\u201d and by the end the girl\u2019s eyes were lit with the cheap warm flame of competence. On the way home she heard a radio caller talk about his fear of driving on bridges, and she found herself saying yes, yes, yes out loud as if he could hear her like a friend in a balcony. She stopped at a market for oranges because she had an orange craving that felt like a religious calling and ran into Mark.\n\nMark had been the kind of person you dated for six months and then broke up with because he wanted to have opinions in your house. He wore a tie with tiny bikes on it. He sold life insurance and what else could you say. He was not unkind. He was a collector of cleverness like a magpie, and he had looked at Ivy sometimes like she was a piece of furniture he thought would be better against that wall, no that wall, never content with where her life pointed. Still, his eyes crinkled at her now in a way that made her feel seen in a soft way that didn\u2019t demand anything.\n\n\u201cIvy!\u201d He squeezed oranges like interrogation. \u201cI heard you\u2019re not flying. That\u2019s a thing now? With you?\u201d\n\nShe blinked. \u201cWith me,\u201d she agreed. She didn\u2019t ask how he\u2019d heard, because Burke is a sieve dressed as a jug.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get over it,\u201d he said, like you\u2019d get over a cold. \u201cEverybody gets jumpy sometimes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cI might not get over it.\u201d\n\nHe tilted his head, amused. \u201cWell, you\u2019re too smart to let your lizard brain run the show. Come on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think my lizard brain is smarter than I am,\u201d she said. \u201cIt has had millions of years of practice. I have had, what, thirty-four?\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll call me when you need a ride to the airport.\u201d\n\nHe walked away and she felt, as she sometimes did, the old tug to defend herself to no one, the imaginary jury that spent the day in her kitchen, drinking coffee, wondering if she was doing it right. She bought the oranges and a small jar of honey because Diego had once said the local stuff burned the throat like a cure. On her way out, Mrs. Dalloway\u2014no, Mrs. Dalrymple, the older neighbor who wore lipstick like she was competing with autumn\u2014caught her by the sleeve and said, \u201cChurch is this Sunday. People are talking about the Easter brunch signups. You can make something right?\u201d\n\n\u201cDeviled eggs,\u201d Ivy said, and forgot that she didn\u2019t go to that church, had gone twice because the music was good and then they'd asked for her soul in twelve installments.\n\nBack home, Diego\u2019s truck was in front of her house, his ladder lopsided on the grass. He was standing with his palms on his hips, looking at the spruces like a chess player looks at an opponent who is both impossible and elegant. Beside him was a man Ivy had seen before and never met. He wore a bright orange vest over a hoodie and had a clipboard, so you knew his power came from paper.\n\n\u201cWe need these cut back today,\u201d the man said when she came up, waving the letter like a flag of truce at a battle no one had agreed to fight. \u201cEncroachment is serious. The lawn is common. The spruces are not. This is how we end up with litigation over broken bones and teenagers hiding behind trees doing things they shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDiego glanced at her like, Do you want me to talk?\n\nShe stood a little straighter. \u201cThey\u2019ve been leaning since Reagan. They\u2019re not threatening anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cRules are rules,\u201d the man said, and his mouth curled in a way that suggested he liked how he sounded. His name tag said KYLE, in letters so self-satisfied it seemed a joke.\n\n\u201cI can trim them,\u201d Diego said. \u201cTomorrow morning. I need to get different rods, big saw. If we cut them willy-nilly they will\u2026die ugly.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d Kyle repeated, and made some notes. \u201cWe\u2019ve had complaints.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom who?\u201d Ivy said.\n\nHe gestured toward a row of townhouses, toward a woman whose blinds fluttered. \u201cFrom those who own eyes,\u201d he said, as if that was a bit of original wit. When he left, his pen clicked like a tick.\n\nDiego laughed when the man was gone, short and sharp. \u201cWe\u2019ll do it right. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pay extra,\u201d Ivy said.\n\n\u201cYou already pay honest. I want to sleep. I don\u2019t sleep if I kill a tree by impatience.\u201d\n\nTo distract herself from picturing the spruces hacked and helpless, she cleaned her bookshelf in the front room, pulled books that felt tired in her hands, listed them for donation. There was an old battered edition of Anne of Green Gables she\u2019d found at a yard sale in Ashburn with a note inside from a girl to her future, written in purple pen with hearts. There was a book of Neruda poems in Spanish she could not read but sometimes pretended to by mouthing the sounds. There were five copies of the same teaching manual because she kept thinking she\u2019d lost it, then found it in a different tote bag. The domestic economy of a tutor is a mess of bags. She found a folded plane ticket stub from nine months before\u2014Chicago, gate B11\u2014and her stomach did a backflip like an amateur gymnast.\n\nShe was on the floor with paperbacks like a fort when the doorbell rang. It was a thin, precise sound, an instrument out of tune. She opened the door to a girl of about ten with hair that had not decided what it wanted to be and cheeks that could carry a lot of joy without breaking. She had a flyer in her hand for a school play and she said, \u201cDo you want to sponsor?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Ivy said, kneeling to the girl\u2019s eye level as if they might exchange secrets.\n\n\u201cLike, give money so we can rent the lights,\u201d the girl said. \u201cOr give us a basket. My mom said to say that. Sponsor.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love lights,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cHow much?\u201d\n\nThe girl named a number and Ivy thought about oranges and plane tickets and the way she would not be going to Austin, and said yes. The girl\u2019s smile tilted the world. On the flyer the school\u2019s mascot\u2014a hawk with generous eyelashes\u2014looked like it could audition for television. The play was Peter Pan.\n\n\u201cSo much flying,\u201d Ivy said without meaning to, and the girl squinted as if looking at something far away. \u201cWe have harnesses,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that high. Also Mr. Turner says the spirit of flying is in your heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he,\u201d Ivy said.\n\nHe was right, and also wrong.\n\nThat night Ivy went to Jess\u2019s to pick up a pie she had foolishly promised to bring to Ruth\u2019s house for Sunday dinner because saying yes to pastry is easier than saying yes to courage. The coffee shop after dark felt like a backstage, all the instruments picked up and put to bed. Jess had a dish towel thrown over her shoulder like a truce flag and flour on her cheek that looked like a smear of chalk. She handed over a lemon chess pie with warnings: don\u2019t jiggle it too much, it will be a little ugly at the edges because that means it\u2019s true, sugar does not need help doing what it does to you.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s the mouse?\u201d Jess said without preamble.\n\n\u201cIt comes out for raisins,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cBut it also steals the raisins from me while I\u2019m asleep.\u201d\n\nJess leaned on her elbows. Her eyes were blue like old denim. \u201cMaybe stop telling people you\u2019re dramatic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt feels like a preemptive strike,\u201d Ivy said. \u201cBefore they get the chance.\u201d\n\nJess\u2019s mouth did a little sideways thing. \u201cOr an invitation for them to be careless.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met a man with a clipboard today.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod help you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiego is going to cut the spruces tomorrow. He won\u2019t kill them. He is precise. He loves the lamb\u2019s ear like it\u2019s a child.\u201d\n\nJess laughed. \u201cHe is\u2026what my mother would have called a serious person. Not solemn. But serious.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo serious people break?\u201d Ivy asked. \u201cIf we push them?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone breaks.\u201d Jess took the towel off her shoulder, folded it like a flag. \u201cBut some of us call it a hinge.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, she took the lemon chess pie to Ruth\u2019s and sat at a sturdy table that had seen more homework than confession. Ruth\u2019s husband, Doug, had a laugh like a grill lighting. Her nieces wore shirts with glitter words. On the walls were framed photos of them in complicated cheerleading stunts that made Ivy\u2019s stomach flip and also made her proud in a generalized aunt way. People who had never fallen like to fly. People who had. Both kinds ended up in frames.\n\nRuth waited until the roast chicken was on the table and the potatoes were passed around like currency and then she said, \u201cI thought about it and I think you should talk to someone. About the plane thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am talking to someone,\u201d Ivy said, hooking Jess and Diego and the ten-year-old girl with the flyer into the definition of someone. \u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is, though,\u201d Ruth said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about your little breakdown at the gate. It\u2019s about sustainability. You can\u2019t sustain this if you\u2019re losing clients.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always do the company presentation voice when you\u2019re trying to love me,\u201d Ivy said gently because she wanted to love her back without letting the voice in. \u201cI want help. I don\u2019t want a brief.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to be\u2026practical.\u201d\n\nDoug watched them like he always did, like a golden retriever deciding whether to jump on the couch. He finally said, \u201cFear is probably trying to keep you alive. Also it\u2019s probably overdoing it. You can have both.\u201d\n\nIvy smiled at him like a medal. \u201cThank you,\u201d she said.\n\nHer nieces asked about boys and about the ROI on college in a way that made Ivy\u2019s throat hurt because they\u2019d learned it somewhere, that acronym, like a prayer. She wanted to put fresh snow over their acronyms and make new tracks. Ruth brought out the pie at the end and said, \u201cDid you bake?\u201d with a tone that made Ivy say, \u201cI did,\u201d even though Jess had. The pie cracked on the top like a drought and there was powdered sugar that made a soft dust that got on everything. They ate it with small forks that had been their mother\u2019s in another life, nickel-silver and a little bent.\n\nOn the way home, Ivy drove the long way through the old part of Burke where the houses still had porches that were not for show. She rolled the windows down in spite of the cold. Somewhere a radio played an old song about flying, which was not helpful. She turned the knob and the song went to unhelpful static. She thought of the photo in Ruth\u2019s hall of the two of them at the Virginia State Fair when they were fifteen and nineteen; there was cotton candy, there were sunburned shoulders, there was the long ago boy who had wanted to kiss Ivy in the Ferris wheel and she\u2019d said no because heights. Always heights. In the story she tells now to girls who want to be brave she is indignant about it. Why should anyone be brave on someone else\u2019s schedule? But at nineteen, the world had no slot for indignation. Just yes or no, ride or get off.\n\nWhen she reached her house, there was a note stuck in the door with blue painter\u2019s tape. The handwriting was blocky, determined. It was Diego\u2019s. It said: I cut a branch then stopped. Something is wrong with the one over the sidewalk. It\u2019s cracked inside. Bigger than I can handle with one ladder. Don\u2019t walk under it if you can help it. Tomorrow morning I bring help.\n\nShe pictured the branch like a bone inside the tree, a fracture you couldn\u2019t see until you pressed. She thought of the way some things held until they didn\u2019t. She thought: I will not learn everything today.\n\nShe slept surprisingly well. Maybe because of the pie. Maybe because if you are told not to walk under a branch you can do that. The rules are specific and the body likes a specific.\n\nAt seven, Diego was there with a man named Oscar and a tangle of ropes that looked like a sea creature. He had a harness like climbers wear and a new hat that must be his working hat because it had a narrow brim that made him look serious in a way you would not laugh at. Ivy made coffee and brought it out and tried not to hover while they arranged their tools as if they were setting a table in a dream where the dessert forks were carabiners.\n\n\u201cGoing to be a tense morning,\u201d Diego said with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll buy me a beer later.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t drink,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI like the idea of beer,\u201d he said pleasantly. \u201cCoffee is my beer.\u201d\n\nShe didn\u2019t ask him how a gardener figured out which branches were dangerous; trust made that question quiet. Oscar went up the ladder with the slow patience of someone talking a friend down from a ledge. Diego spotted him with a hand on his ankle when the ladder shifted. There were a few neighbors peeking through blinds or pretending to check their mail. Burke watched each other in ways that mostly meant well and sometimes didn\u2019t. Ivy held the coiled extension cord like a dog leash that led nowhere.\n\nKyle arrived with his clipboard thirty minutes in, of course he did. He had that smell of a man who has never sweated for anything but sports. He stood just inside the property line and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll want to angle that cut,\u201d at a volume that suggested he hoped to be mistaken for a person in charge.\n\n\u201cWe know,\u201d Diego said without looking down.\n\nKyle stepped closer, too close, feet under the locus of the tree, the branch that groaned very softly. \u201cSeriously, you don\u2019t want it to split. Then we\u2019ve got a mess. Liability. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack up,\u201d Diego said, suddenly loud. \u201cSir, move. Not under.\u201d Oscar paused, saw what Diego saw, froze.\n\nKyle laughed. \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d he said. \u201cI know trees. My grandfather had an orchard.\u201d\n\n\u201cCool,\u201d Diego said, not cool at all. \u201cBack.\u201d\n\nIt happened in less than a breath. The sound was a rip, like cloth but deeper, as if the day itself had been torn. The branch\u2014that hidden failure\u2014gave. One end swung toward the sidewalk, gathering speed that shamed the word swing. Diego moved then like a person whose body had signed a contract. He shoved Kyle hard, both hands, not a suggestion, a demand. Kyle stumbled, pinwheeled, tripped over the curb, went down with his leg twisted beneath him and there was a sound that made Ivy\u2019s mouth fill with spit, the body\u2019s idiot compassion.\n\nThe branch slammed into the place where Kyle had been. It hit the pavement and cracked into two, a neat cloven thing. The ladder juddered but Oscar had an arm around the trunk already, legs knotted into the bark, eyes wide and very alive.\n\nThen there was the after. The quiet that pretended the noise hadn\u2019t happened. Then the shouting. Kyle screaming and then saying, \u201cIt\u2019s my leg, my leg,\u201d as if he could negotiate with it. Diego, soft again, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t move. Don\u2019t try to stand,\u201d his hands near but not touching. Ivy, already on the phone with 911, her voice oddly calm, trying out the sentences for size: There was an accident. The branch\u2014yes, he\u2019s breathing. Yes, conscious.\n\nNeighbors came like ghosts in day clothes. Jess appeared at the curb with half her apron still on, because news in a small town beat the posted hours. She knelt at Kyle\u2019s head and held her hand just above his forehead and said, \u201cBreathe the way you breathe when you want to sleep,\u201d and someone brought a blanket; there is always a blanket.\n\nThe ambulance took too long, as ambulances will when you stand next to a broken thing and all you can do is be human, and that is an insult you take a long time to forgive. When they finally came and wrapped the leg in something that made it look like a promise instead of a limb, Diego stood back, shook his hands once like a dog does after rain. He looked more rattled than he allowed. He was the color of paper.\n\n\u201cYou saved his head,\u201d Jess said. \u201cYou put his head where the branch wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDiego shrugged. His eyes tracked the broken limb of the tree without affection but with respect. \u201cIt\u2019s always the head,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where the trouble sets up a tent.\u201d\n\nKyle, pale and grim and transformed into a person you\u2019d give soup to, reached for Diego\u2019s sleeve. \u201cYou pushed me,\u201d he said, incredulous, as if the concept of humane physics had never occurred to him.\n\nDiego leaned in so their eyes were level. \u201cI pushed you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll send me the complaint later.\u201d\n\nKyle laughed in a way that was half sob. It made Ivy like him almost. The EMT looked at Diego and said, \u201cYou did good,\u201d which is a sentence that can last you a few days if you ration it.\n\nBy noon there were texts on Ivy\u2019s phone from numbers she didn\u2019t know. A neighbor had posted on the community board, the social media\u2019s tidy yard with its passive-aggressive herb garden, about the branch and the pushing and the saving. Someone wrote hero. Someone wrote liability. Someone wrote I told you those spruces. The internet is a potluck that always runs out of the good salads.\n\nDiego came in and washed his hands at her kitchen sink for a long time, quiet and methodical. He scrubbed soil from under his nails with the small brush Ivy kept for that purpose and had actually never used. The water ran brown then clear. He dried his hands on a towel with lemons on it, making the lemons damp and less happy. Ivy watched him for a second and then reached out, pressed her palm to his forearm just above the wrist. It was not the kind of thing she did. But the body calls sometimes.\n\n\u201cI have beer,\u201d she said, and he laughed in relief.\n\nShe poured two glasses of apple cider instead, because beer was an idea and cider was liquid apple, and they sat at her table and looked at the slice of tree that had fallen and now lay in the yard like a whale bone. \u201cYou saved him,\u201d she said, not because he didn\u2019t know, but because the sentence wanted to be said by someone other than an EMT.\n\n\u201cI broke his leg,\u201d Diego said. He examined the rim of his glass as if the answer were written there.\n\n\u201cYou saved his head,\u201d she repeated, and he let that sentence sit between them. You could see him weigh it like a stone in his palm, not entirely convinced it was the right weight but grateful.\n\nOutside, Oscar finished the job with the art of someone who had done hard things and felt that doing them right was either the penance or the prize; he trimmed the tear clean, made a wound that could heal.\n\nJess texted a heart and a bagel emoji, because in this town bagels have replaced casseroles as the love gift. Ruth called and said, \u201cYou okay?\u201d in a voice that sounded like a road built quickly and well. Ivy said, \u201cI am,\u201d and found that she was and then found that she wasn\u2019t and then that she was again. It was not a permanent condition. She imagined standing at a gate, a plane at the window. The old panic rose and she watched it, the way you watch a cat in your yard. It did its elegant, cruel little dance. It would not be coaxed. She did not coax. She let it be a weather. She opened her palm on the table. Her life was the same size as it had been yesterday. The branch had broken. The leg had broken. Something else had been saved and maybe that was hers too.\n\nIn the afternoon, her email dinged with a message from a woman who ran a foundation for kids in the county who needed tutoring and whose families could not pay. Somebody on the community board had tagged her in a thread about Ivy being reliable and kind even in emergencies, which is not a thing you put on your website because you don\u2019t think to. The foundation had a grant. They needed someone to coordinate summer sessions at the library. Work not far. Work with a roof like a quiet ship. Work that did not require a plane.\n\nShe read the email twice, three times, like decoding a foreign tongue. Outside, the cut on the tree shone and glistened raw and noble, and the whole neighborhood felt long and thin and newly connected, as if a line had been drawn between her front steps and a dozen people who wanted to say: we saw that. We will think better of you, not worse, because of what you fear and what you did anyway, which was neither fly nor run away, but stand and hold a phone and call and not panic even when something in your skin panicked.\n\nShe could still hear Kyle\u2019s laugh that had the sob in it. She could still hear the branch, that deep rip. She got up from the table, slid the dining room chair in like the end of a chapter, and went to the front yard. The air had more gold in it now. She stood in front of the spruces and lifted her hands and breathed the way you breathe when you want to sleep. The trees did not know her. They held. They rustled like polite older men who had decided to forgive you for something you had not done. The house next door smelled like someone was making cinnamon toast. A bus far off coughed. It would rain again in a few days; this was the truce.\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said to no one and to the world. \u201cOkay.\u201d She said it again because sometimes you need a second okay to make the first one real.\n\nTomorrow there would be insurance forms and maybe a stern letter and maybe a thank-you card and possibly a new job that involved the smell of library books and the quiet rumble of people trying. Tomorrow she would still not be able to step onto a plane and the sky would not care and the robin on the fence would shake its slick head and live its tiny life with competence. Sometimes the not-caring of the sky was relief. Sometimes it was an insult. Today, she let it be relief.\n\nWhen she went inside, she wrote to the foundation yes, with a careful delight that felt like dipping a ladle. She called the Austin family and made a plan to have her colleague Liam go in her place, to stand in the kitchen with the pirate boy, to say, \u201cThe therapist the pirates get, what do you think he would say?\u201d She cut an orange in the sink and ate it over the drain like a student in a hurry, the juice running down her wrist. A flake of powdered sugar from the pie fell on the counter where it had no right to still be. She licked it off her finger and laughed, the small imperfect laugh of a person who has begun, by inches, to forgive herself for being herself.\n\nAt dusk there was a knock on her door. Not a doorbell, a knock, polite but urgent. She opened it to find Kyle, on crutches, a hospital boot swallowing his shin, a paper wristband still on like a club bracelet. His face was the color of cooked pasta, his mouth amateur with thanks.\n\n\u201cI brought this,\u201d he said, and held up a potted plant. It was a fern. The kind that did not forgive rough words. He had tied a ribbon to it, haphazardly and also earnestly. There was a card stuffed in its fronds.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re up,\u201d she said, flustered, because what do you say to a man whose leg you have not broken and who also nearly had his skull split in your yard.\n\n\u201cThe Vicodin is working too,\u201d he said with a little chortle that wanted to be a man giggle. \u201cI wanted to say. You saved my life. Or he did. But it was your...thing, your people, your property, I don\u2019t know.\u201d He squinted at his own flailing sentence. \u201cI am a pain in the ass. I am a rules person. I will still be. But I will also...not be. A bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she said because what else. \u201cDo you want to sit?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll fall asleep,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted to say it out loud. Thank you. Don\u2019t tell anybody I said so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d she lied kindly, because she would tell Jess and Diego and the spruces if she could. She would tell the girl who brought the flyer that sometimes the flying doesn\u2019t look like a harness. The garden behind him breathed. Burke breathed, the tight breath of suburbs easing, just a bit, in the low light. Ivy watched him swing himself back down the steps, careful, careful, and had the sudden, impossible thought: I am not a problem to solve. I am a person to tend. It felt like a true thing and that felt like a miracle.\n\nThe night came on like a lake, and overhead a plane blinked its small impolite lights across the dark. Ivy watched it go. It did not make her heart stampede. It made her imagine the people inside, their knees, the baby bored with the miracle, the woman who put on lip balm before landing, the old man who couldn\u2019t hear the captain. People in a tube hurtling, alive together. She waved at them with two fingers, a rude little salute from the ground. She did not wish herself there. She did not wish herself anywhere else. For once, the ground was exactly the right distance from her feet. She went inside and wrote a list on a yellow pad: call library. call Liam. orange juice. return Mrs. Dalrymple\u2019s pie tin. tell Jess: teacups. \n\nThe pen stuttered once and kept going. She placed the list under a magnet on the fridge shaped like a cow wearing glossy boots\u2014why had she chosen that, when?\u2014and smiled at it. The house shifted imperceptibly, trying to find its balance, and she shifted with it, and found hers.",

                              "content": "In the week after the branch, the cut on the spruce dried into something dignified and deliberate, pale as bone, and Ivy felt that she could walk under it without making bargains in her head. She told herself she would not be the sort of person who visited a wound daily, but she found excuses to go to the mailbox, to check the rosemary, to look for the cardinal that had taken to scolding the world from the gutter of her roof. Diego came back twice to check the sealant he\u2019d brushed on the exposed wood, once with a bucket of compost he called black gold and once with a coil of rope over his shoulder because he said someone had asked him to move a hammock, as if hammocks were wild animals that needed coaxing. He refused money for the extra trips. He took two oranges from the bowl on her counter with the reverence of a thief who wants to be caught and thanked.\n\nThe email from the foundation turned into a meeting on a Thursday morning at the county library, a building that made its arguments in glass and beige carpet and a smell like paper that had been rained on and then dried in a hurry. The woman who had written, whose name turned out to be Maritza, wore earrings like commas and had a laugh that could cut a ribbon. She shook Ivy\u2019s hand as if this were a trade in respect. Behind her desk there was a calendar with watercolor pictures of national parks and a mug that read, Ask me about my holds.\n\n\u201cWe do summer learning every year,\u201d Maritza said, tapping a stack of folders with a pen whose cap had been worried to death. \u201cIt\u2019s usually good-natured chaos. We try to make it less chaos, more good. This year we have the grant for more hours, more tutors. I have a list of kids from the counselors who need extra eyes and extra patience. You look like you have both.\u201d\n\nIvy spooked slightly at the compliment and then folded herself neatly around it. \u201cI have a lot of Post-its,\u201d she said. \u201cI have metaphors like stray cats. And I can be here. I like this room.\u201d She gestured at the study tables like ships anchored in a safe harbor, at the bulletin board where someone with neat block letters had made a display of \u201cBooks with Bridges.\u201d\n\nMaritza inclined her head. \u201cI like anybody who likes the room.\u201d She spread out a crude map of the summer with boxes for weeks. There were themes penciled in, half committed and half shy: Maps and Journeys, Food Stories, Birds, Not Flying. Maritza\u2019s eyebrows hopped. \u201cThat last one is a joke,\u201d she said. \u201cA librarian joke. We\u2019ll find a better word. Maybe Migration. Maybe We Move.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe Staying,\u201d Ivy said, and then shook her head because it sounded defensive and she did not want her summer to carry her refusal like a banner. \u201cMaybe We Move and We Stay. Maybe how to be somewhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth is my favorite,\u201d Maritza said. \u201cMy mother emigrated twice and then decided her true homeland was the grocery store with the tortillas and the good mangoes. We can make a poster say that.\u201d She flipped a page. \u201cWe also have volunteers. Teens mostly. A boy who will make better spreadsheets than I do. A girl who will refuse to shelve romance novels unless you remind her that librarians do not get to be snobs. You\u2019ll like them. They bring snacks.\u201d\n\nThey walked the space. The children\u2019s section had a carpet with roads printed on it as if whoever designed it had wanted to make a point about following lines. A toddler lay on his belly in the middle of an intersection, rolling a car with an intensity that made him look like a tiny mechanic. In a corner there was a fixture where bird puppets lived on sticks like dignified old professors waiting for appointments. Ivy ran a finger over the wing of a cardinal with felt that had lost its nap. She felt like someone who had stumbled into her job rather than someone who had applied for it. But the joy in her throat was not a stumble. She could build a summer of small, useful things. She could make a way to learn that did not require planes.\n\nOn the drive home she passed the sports fields by the middle school where a line of cheerleaders in practice T-shirts did stunts that made the air itself seem rubbery. The sight would have ordinarily made her stomach tip, but she gripped the wheel lightly and imagined she was holding the car in conversation rather than in fear. She told herself there would be a time to try and there would be a time to be proud of not trying. She was getting better at telling the difference. She called Liam from a red light and left a message that was more gratitude than instruction. He texted back a photo of the blonde boy in Austin with Treasure Island on the counter next to a bowl of cereal that looked like a collection of small moons.\n\nHe\u2019d written, in block letters on a Post-it stuck to the book, The pirates are in group work. The R in pirates was a little wounded, leaning to the left. Ivy put the phone in her lap and let herself be both happy and crestfallen, a trick she was startlingly bad at and wanted to get better at. She sent back a heart and a stupid GIF of a parrot doing a power stance and then, because it felt like confession, she added: Tell him I am learning the ferry.\n\nJess called to ask if Ivy could pick up milk on her way, the whole milk in the glass bottle because the espresso machine had developed a taste for drama. Ivy swung by the small grocery where Mark had squeezed oranges and this time she didn\u2019t run into anyone she\u2019d dated, which felt like luck or a lesson. The cashier had purple hair that was beginning to recede at the temples, bravely, and had the courtesy to ask no questions about how someone could leave with only bottles and a banana. Jess\u2019s bell chimed when she pushed the door and the sound hit her in the sternum like a knock from a friendly ghost. The morning had draped itself over the shop in light like a shawl. The chalkboard had a drawing of a frog with a crown and the phrase Kiss at your own risk scrawled in a high schooler\u2019s confident cursive.\n\n\u201cMy machine is sulking,\u201d Jess said, wiping the bar with a rag that had died heroically long ago. \u201cI named her after an opera singer. I regret it. She is living up to it.\u201d\n\nIvy set the milk down with a thunk that felt ritualistic. \u201cYou want me to talk to her?\u201d she said. \u201cTell her about accountability?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can do it when I close for an hour and all the men who think they want cortados are at lunch pretending they like arugula.\u201d Jess\u2019s hair was braided today with a ribbon that looked like it had been stolen from a present. She leaned her hip against the counter. \u201cHow\u2019s the library?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike a ship. Like a Lego kit that\u2019s missing one weird brick and you have to engineer your way around it and the solution is better anyway.\u201d\n\nJess\u2019s face opened the way it did when Ivy said something that sounded like poetry by accident. \u201cYou like the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like the room.\u201d Ivy felt brave enough to say it twice. \u201cThey want me to name weeks. We Move. We Stay. We Eat Oranges and Call It Science.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should do a week where you show kids how to name their own weeks,\u201d Jess said. \u201cGive them a calendar and rib their months like a roast chicken. What week saved you? What week made you want to lie down in the produce section and weep at the sight of grapes?\u201d\n\n\u201cA menu of redemption,\u201d Ivy said, and Jess laughed into her wrist like she was sipping the laugh.\n\nOn Saturday morning, the farmer\u2019s market in the parking lot of the church was a handful of bright tents like handkerchiefs. Diego\u2019s table was there for the first time in months because the frost had finally loosened its grip and things were becoming themselves again. He had flats of seedlings with names written in tidy rows on popsicle sticks: basil, chard, zinnia, black-eyed Susan. Children made a small queue to touch the lamb\u2019s ear, people who had known softness and wanted to make sure they still did. Diego had a cardboard sign that read Feel this one and a stack of pamphlets about native plants with photocopies that made the photographs look haunted.\n\n\u201cYou are becoming an entrepreneur,\u201d Ivy said, presenting herself at the corner of his tent like a regular.\n\n\u201cI am becoming a person who can leave a pamphlet and charge five dollars for a plant and both things are true,\u201d he said. He wore a shirt with paint on it in a pattern that looked like a map of islands. He handed her a small pot of something she did not recognize and she held it the way you hold a small bird that has allowed itself to be caught.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cA foxglove,\u201d he said. \u201cPoisonous if you devour it. Beautiful if you don\u2019t. Like everything.\u201d\n\nShe frowned. \u201cIs this a metaphor I need today?\u201d\n\nDiego shrugged with his eyebrows, which was a skill she envied. \u201cIt is a bell you can ignore if you have no need to ring it.\u201d\n\nJess appeared with a broom she did not need to be carrying because she did not sweep the outside world, and leaned it against her shoulder like a spear. \u201cI came to see you two in the wild,\u201d she announced. \u201cAnd to buy a jar of honey from Mrs. Pomfret because she wears a beekeeper hat like a crown and I would like to feel like that when I pour sweetness onto things.\u201d\n\nThey meandered for an hour in the soft sun and bought lettuce with dirt clinging to it like loyalty, a loaf of bread with a crust that looked like a geological feature, a bunch of radishes that had the kind of pink that makes you forgive worse pinks. A man with a clipboard\u2014different clipboards existed, Ivy had to remember\u2014was collecting signatures for a petition to prevent the removal of a footbridge in the park that had been declared unfit. He said \u201cinfrastructure\u201d as if he felt it in his molars. Ivy signed because she liked bridges even when they frightened her. When they walked away she considered that loving something you feared was a complicated religion and felt a bit proud to be a congregant.\n\nThe play the little girl had advertised the week before was on a Friday night and Ivy almost forgot it until she found the flyer under a stack of mail by the door where things went to become ancient. She went because she had given money for lights and you cannot buy light and then ignore where it shines. The gymnasium had been transformed into a theater using conviction and black curtains. Parents found seats the way people find their places at weddings, jockeying without meanness. The hawk mascot made an appearance before the show to remind everyone not to stand on the bleachers and to turn off their phones and it was so earnest about it that people actually did.\n\nWhen Peter flew, it was four feet off the ground and the harness creaked and the stagehand who pulled the rope wore a tiara. It was beautiful. Ivy cried a little in the secretive way of public criers, looking down and pretending to adjust her program. The girl from her porch was Wendy and did a bow at the end that was so proud and so shy at once that Ivy felt a desire to protect every child in the world like a flood that washed nothing away. Afterward she stood awkwardly in the lobby with the table of bake sale items and told the girl she had been brave and the girl said, \u201cYeah, but the boy who played Michael got stuck in the wires and didn\u2019t cry and saved his own life,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cThat\u2019s a fine thing to know how to do.\u201d\n\nRuth texted from a conference room downtown a picture of a bowl of pillowy gnocchi she would never eat because she had a sudden call and three men waiting for a document. Ivy sent back a photo of the stage with the rope and wrote: Controlled flight. Ruth replied with a plane emoji and a heart and Ivy had the startling thought that they were raising each other, still, in the small hours between responsibility and sleep.\n\nOn a Monday, when the sun had decided to take a personal day, Ivy took herself to the VRE station and bought a ticket to Alexandria with the zeal of someone making an unambiguous gesture toward the future. It wasn\u2019t a ferry, but it was at least a machine that carried people with a timetable and a promise and she wanted to teach her body not to revolt at the first sign of forward motion that wasn\u2019t her hands on a wheel. The platform smelled like wet newspapers and somebody\u2019s lemon hand lotion. A man in a blazer did a crossword holding the paper at a slant only he understood. Ivy sat on a bench and watched a boy jump from square to square as if the nonexistent cracks could undo him. The train came shouldering into the station with a confidence that made her want to applaud. She got on without announcing it to anyone but her shoes. She sat by the window and did not tell herself stories that had unhappy endings. Across from her a woman in scrubs slept with her mouth slightly open, her wrist bristling with hair ties, an exhausted queen returning from a battlefield of flus.\n\nThe trip was only twenty-eight minutes, almost laughably brief, but it was a sentence she could say to Ruth later without bracing. In Alexandria she stood on the platform under a sky that thought about raining and considered immediately getting back on the return train to make the experience symmetrical. Instead she walked to a bakery that sold croissants like layered promises and ate one still steaming on the inside and felt the laminations of her courage flop into place, not perfect, but there. She texted Jess a photo and wrote Teacups in the caption because Jess had once told her that courage was a trickle and you had to catch it in small dishes. Jess replied with a picture of three ceramic cups with little handles like ears that someone had made at the art center with such irregular tenderness that they made Ivy want to be nice to every maker.\n\nOn her way home from the station, she passed the Workhouse Arts Center where the old prison had become a village of studios and places where people took classes in glass and clay and the disciplined making of sound. There was a banner for a performance by a string quartet and an exhibit of paper cut into forests so intricate you felt you could walk into them and never find daylight again. She almost turned in. She almost didn\u2019t. She did. It was a small betrayal of her plan and she congratulated herself for it like a villain. In Studio W-7, a woman with hair like a cloud of silver thread was teaching a class of people who looked like accountants on their day off to throw bowls. The woman\u2019s voice was soothing and exacting. She said, \u201cThe clay wants something. Ask it what it wants,\u201d and the students laughed and did what she said anyway.\n\nIvy bought a small mug glazed in a green that made her think of the rosemary after rain and on the bottom it said, in a careful hand, OKAY. She had the sudden, ridiculous sense that the mug had been made for her. She held it to her sternum on the way to the car to keep it from jostling and thought of the night she had stood in her yard and told the air okay twice to make it true. She imagined drinking from it at the library during Maps and Journeys week and seeing that word as she tipped it to her mouth like a permission slip.\n\nThe summer job began in miniature, as all good things should. Ivy sat with Maritza and a boy named Mason who had the energy of a small generator and a girl named Amina who had perfect eyeliner and was incapable of pretending to like a book she didn\u2019t respect. Mason had a key ring with too many keys and which he wore on his belt with a hook that made him look powerful. He said, \u201cThe keys for the supply cabinet are color-coded,\u201d in a way that suggested that he had put in the effort to make it so and wanted the world to reflect that care back at him. Amina leafed through a stack of picture books about maps and said, \u201cIf one more author thinks children want to look at a picture of a compass, I\u2019m going to stage a coup.\u201d Ivy assigned them to make signs and they took to it with the seriousness of sous-chefs, conferring over font choices with the ferocity of litigators.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon a boy named Bryce was sent to Ivy with the note, \u201cHe reads like he\u2019s fighting. Please make it not a war.\u201d Bryce had hair like a single stubborn idea and a watch that told him how much he had moved in the day, which depressed him. He sat down across from her with the vibe of someone who believed in gravity only when it suited him. Ivy asked him what he wanted the room to be called and he said, without looking up from the tabletop, \u201cThe bunker.\u201d She said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and they pretended it was a bunker and when they pretended it he stopped hunching his shoulders so high. She asked him if he wanted to read a book about a kid who had an underground house and he said, \u201cLame,\u201d and she said, \u201cAgree to disagree,\u201d and read the first two pages like she was telling a ghost story. He looked up two paragraphs later with the impatience of someone ready to be interested but determined to make you work for it. By the time the hour was up, he had said, \u201cI guess\u201d three times in a tone that meant yes.\n\nShe told people the truth when she could bear to. When a student asked where she went all the time because her Instagram, which no one looked at, had all these photos of airports from different years, she said, \u201cI went places for work and I might again later, but for now I\u2019m building a different kind of map,\u201d and they blinked and then asked for her to draw a funny dinosaur which was a relief because her dinosaur was always embarrassing and children love adult embarrassment when it is offered without shame.\n\nKyle appeared in her life like weather. She saw him at the end of her block with a clipboard he had not yet figured out how to carry with a crutch, trying to sign his name in the precise box a neighbor had drawn for a package. He waved her over with a finger flick that would have annoyed her in other circumstances and said, \u201cI owe you a form,\u201d as if gratitude boiled down to thick paper. He had not lost his smell of certainty, but it was hushed. He asked her about the spruces with something like tenderness and listened to her answer as if it mattered how a tree healed. When he said, \u201cMy grandmother would slap me if she heard me say this, but thank God I broke my leg and not my head,\u201d he touched his hand to the place above his ear in a gesture that seemed borrowed from someone gentler.\n\nSometimes the fear returned in the loud way, marching down the hall of her body banging cymbals. It happened in the frozen section of the grocery store when a documentary on the small television by the TV dinners showed an airplane wing dutifully flexing; it happened when a summer storm unzipped the sky and the thunder arrived delayed, like guilt. It seemed more manageable when she learned to point at it in her head and say, This is Tuesday fear, which will pass by Thursday, instead of saying, This is my fear forever. She told Jess she was practicing this and Jess said, \u201cTuesday fear is a jerk,\u201d and Ivy fell in love with the sentence as if it were a button she could sew onto the days.\n\nDiego roped her into planting a night garden for the woman who came home at dawn smelling like the hospital\u2019s harsher virtues. The woman\u2019s yard was a postage stamp with a fence that had gone gray under the strain of keeping anything in or out. They dug in the late afternoon when the sun thought better of itself and followed a line Diego had laid out with twine and very small flags stolen from some unknown child\u2019s birthday. He told her stories of the plants like family gossip. The moonflower would be a show-off and you had to love it anyway. The jasmine would be a quiet friend but would try to do too much if you didn\u2019t give it limits. Ivy listened like a parishioner. She pressed her thumb into soil and then into her tongue and tasted iron and days. When they were done, the woman stood in the doorway in scrubs that held onto the day\u2019s sadness and said, \u201cI don\u2019t deserve this,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cYes you do,\u201d with such conviction she startled herself. On the way home, the sky was the color of a bruise with good circulation and the first star went into the job with no fuss.\n\nThe day the espresso machine at Jess\u2019s actually collapsed into melodrama, hissing and coughing like a small dragon that had swallowed dust, Jess closed the shop for an hour and declared a council. Ivy stood with both hands braced on the counter and listened to the symptoms and then did the thing she was good at: she took the complicated thing apart gently, spoke to each piece as if it were a student, and put it back together with one rogue spring correctly humble again. She used a tiny screwdriver she kept in her bag for fixing glasses and a binder clip she had in her pocket because a life like hers demanded that you always be able to hold things together at a moment\u2019s notice. When the machine shuddered back to life, Jess put both hands on Ivy\u2019s cheeks and said, \u201cDo not underestimate what you are for us,\u201d which is the sort of sentence you should only say if you mean it, and Jess meant it so hard it made Ivy need to sit down. She sipped the first shot pulled from the redeemed machine and said, \u201cIt tastes like someone took off their heavy coat,\u201d and Jess said, \u201cYes,\u201d and that was that.\n\nA letter arrived addressed to \u201cMs. Keane: Flight,\u201d which would have been funny if it hadn\u2019t come with a brochure about virtual exposure therapy folded inside. Mrs. Howard, of the boots and the eucalyptus office, had sent it along with a note the size of a business card that said, \u201cIf you like being modern, here is modern.\u201d Ivy put it in a drawer with the old keys and the things that might save her later. She set a calendar reminder to think about it in a month. She was not going to be the kind of person who pretended she didn\u2019t need help just because she had already saved a man\u2019s head indirectly and taken a train. She could both be brave and accept that her courage had staff meetings it needed to attend.\n\nAt night she listened to the planes less. They still crossed the sky like stitched shut mouths. She imagined sometimes what an overhead compartment felt like. She imagined the sound of ice clink in plastic cups. It did not send her heart into the bad gallop as often. Sometimes she lay on her back on the rug like a person organizing her nerves and thought about her grandfather\u2019s Shakespeare in the glove compartment and the way some kinds of bravery rub off on you if you touch the right things often enough. The Word as talisman. The plant as spell. The list on the fridge like a meal plan for a soul.\n\nWhen the first day of Maps and Journeys arrived, the room filled with children who had eaten fruit roll-ups for breakfast and grandmothers who loved hard in lectures. Maritza stood at the door pretending to be a bouncer. A boy with a buzz cut and a shirt that read GO BIG OR GO HOME announced that he was a home person and so would be going big at home and Ivy clapped her hands once and said, \u201cFair,\u201d and went on to explain that maps could also be of rooms and of heads. She gave them paper and told them to draw where their good ideas went when they were asleep. Mason put out small compasses because he could not let go of the joy of objects, and Amina arranged stacks of books in little altars and pretended not to be proud of her arrangements. Ivy told the story of a map that had a mistake on it that sent people to a town that was not there, and how the town built a sign anyway so that people would not feel foolish for traveling. The children laughed and the parents laughed and she watched how the laughter sounded the same and also different and it made her chest feel like a window opening.\n\nIn the afternoon, a girl with hair that did not obey stood at the table without sitting and said, \u201cMy mother says you won\u2019t fly,\u201d and Ivy considered lying and then did not. She said, \u201cYour mother is right,\u201d and the girl pursed her lips as if that were interesting. \u201cWill you never?\u201d she asked, and Ivy said, \u201cMaybe later,\u201d and the girl said, \u201cCool,\u201d and went to color a river that looked like a snake. Ivy did not feel judged. She felt recorded, which is different.\n\nThe Austin boy sent a postcard in Liam\u2019s neat teacher cursive with a dictation at the bottom that was unmistakably his. The postcard had a picture of bats in a cave which, unhelpfully, also fly, but cave was good in the way that enclosed things are sometimes good. The dictation read: The pirates gave each other gold stars for trying. The therapist said a thing about how the sea is not out to get us. I do not believe him. But he was nice. The boy had drawn a pirate with a speech bubble that said I am terrible at pillaging feelings, and Ivy laughed and put the card on the fridge near the cow with boots and thought that perhaps the sea was not out to get her either. Perhaps it simply was, like the sky, like a sister, like a town.\n\nOn a rainy weekend afternoon when plans for the park had canceled themselves, Ruth showed up with takeout from a Thai place they both loved and an expression that suggested someone at work had decided to be stupid out loud. They sat on the floor with the cartons because the table had become a staging area for library things, and they ate curried noodles with a competence that came from a childhood where nobody made rules about elbows. Ruth listened to the story of Bryce saying \u201cI guess\u201d in three different tones like a musician listening for theme and variation. Ivy listened to Ruth talk about a bid protest that would cost someone their sense of self-importance, which would be good for the world, and then about the way her older daughter had wanted to learn a TikTok dance that made no sense to the human body. They took turns telling the truth and taking out the trash. It was the kind of evening that would not make a photograph. It was the kind that sticks.\n\n\u201cDo you think we learned worry,\u201d Ivy said when the rain went tender, \u201cor were we born with it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ruth said promptly, and they both laughed. Ruth moved a stack of binders to the side with her foot. \u201cDad told me once that he took the long way home sometimes because he liked the way the lights looked from the other direction. I think he wanted us to know we could make our own routes. We heard him and then we forgot and then we remembered. That\u2019s the pattern, I think. We forget and we remember.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe used to keep Shakespeare in the glove compartment,\u201d Ivy said, and Ruth rolled her eyes like someone who had been told that story too many times and loved it anyway. \u201cBecause he believed in a place for everything and the glove compartment had not yet found its destiny,\u201d Ruth said, and they said the last three words together because they had a script between them and scripts are comfort.\n\nWhen Ruth left, the quiet in the house felt chosen, which is a different thing than inherited. Ivy washed the takeout containers like she might keep them forever and then put them into recycling because she believed in the magic of what would happen to them after. She went to the door and touched the rosemary like a rosary and then stood at the edge of the yard under the spruce and looked up at the healed face of the branch. The cut was not pretty. It was honest. It told the truth about having once been attached to something and now not being attached and continuing anyway. The wind tugged at her hair like it was a sleeve. A plane went over so high the sound arrived like a concept. She waved with two fingers, the rude salute that had become a benediction. She went inside to her list on the fridge and added a new line: consider ferry. Underneath she wrote in smaller letters, remind pirates they can swim. She stood there with the pen in her hand and felt something in her chest tip like a picture finding the nail it was meant to hang on. She did not feel fixed. She felt held in place, just enough to look around.\n\nThe next morning, she took a child to the window of the library and pointed out the bus stop where people waited with their human faces on. She told him every time someone got on a bus it was the beginning of a story and he looked skeptical and then he saw a woman run and make it and he said, \u201cOkay, maybe,\u201d which is what so much of love sounds like, if you listen. The day went on. The summer edged closer. The foundation sent another email with a schedule to approve and a note that said, \u201cWe put your name on the flyer,\u201d and she read the line twice, three times, and did not feel the urge to be anyone else. She took the foxglove outside into the light and found a place where it might ring its bell without hurting anyone. She wrote to the Austin boy again and told him the therapist was right, the sea was not out to get him, but he was allowed to mistrust it until it proved itself. She told him she was learning a different kind of boat. He would understand. He would draw her a picture that made the boat look impractical and brave. She would put it on the fridge next to the cow with boots and the word OKAY. The world would tilt again and she would find her feet. She always had. She was learning how to call that learning by its name.",

                              "content": "The first week of the library program began with birds because Amina refused to call it Birds, Not Flying on the signs and Mason had printed little cutouts of feathers on the color printer and had gotten ink on his thumbs like a kid with blueberry stains. They set up a table with paper gliders and another with kite kits that would have to wait for a day with more wind, and on the whiteboard Ivy drew a badly proportioned hawk with emphatic eyelashes in homage to the school mascot. She told the story of how pigeons used to carry messages tied to their legs and a boy with hair like stickleback fins said, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, you could put the message on your phone,\u201d and she agreed and also disagreed and said, \u201cSometimes the ridiculous things get the job done because they\u2019re ridiculous and nobody thinks to stop them.\u201d Bryce arrived late and leaned in the doorway like a spy, then slid into a chair and acted as if he had been there forever. When they opened a book about owls and the tactics they use to fly without sound, he took his feet off the rung of the chair and tucked them under, and he said, \u201cSo they are ninjas,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cThe woods are full of ninjas if you listen,\u201d and he pretended not to like that and liked it anyway. The room hummed with scissors and soft talk and the particular scrape of paper being folded into a guess at aerodynamics, and when the first glider drifted across the span between two tables and landed on a girl\u2019s shoulder, she squealed like someone had thrown a party just for her. Ivy\u2019s mouth was full of the taste she had begun to recognize as the flavor of doing a thing exactly appropriate to who she was capable of being, which was not heroic and also not negligible, and she held it like a piece of candy she intended to make last.\n\nThe suggestion for a ferry did not come to her in a dream, though she would have told that version of the story more readily at a dinner party. It arrived by text, Jess\u2019s particular staccato voice made into sentences: Water taxi on the Potomac. You can start with a loop. It is ridiculous and safe. I will wear my braid like a seatbelt. There was a link to the schedule and an emoji of a boat that looked like a child\u2019s toy, and Ivy tapped the link and watched the line of times arrange themselves into a day. The thought of stepping onto a floating thing did not sink her; it lifted and then bobbed, the way a cork lifts and knows itself. She thought of the boy in Austin insisting the pirates needed therapy and of herself insisting she needed a boat that did not pretend to be the sky, and she texted back Yes like someone agreeing to a small harmless dare. The plan became specific because specificity calmed a body more than platitudes, so they chose Thursday, the ten-forty departure from the Alexandria waterfront toward The Wharf, and Jess said she would bring ginger candy and Ivy said she would bring the OKAY mug in her bag as a talisman. They did not tell anyone else because crowds were not helpful when one learned a new kind of balance.\n\nThe night before the water taxi, Ivy went to check the rosemary and caught movement in the spruces that made her think of her own startle response, small and honest and not to be argued with. Grabbing the little binoculars she kept on the sill because the cardinal had converted her into a person who watched birds like a gossip column, she saw that a robin had made a nest in the crotch just below the cut place where the branch had been. The nest was a tidy bowl, grass and something fibrous that looked like the unraveled inside of a cheap mop, and the robin sat like an ancient queen, puffed and serene, while the wind negotiated terms with the needles. The sight made her throat go lemon-sour with an emotion she was tired of calling hope and needed a new name for, something you could stack on a shelf without it rolling off. She texted a picture to Diego and he replied with a photo of his hand held up like a visor: Blessings to the new apartment, he wrote, and then, because he didn\u2019t like to leave people with only metaphor, he added that he\u2019d be by in the morning to look at the sealant again, and also did she want extra compost for the foxglove because it liked to live like royalty, demanding and a little poisonous.\n\nThe HOA meeting was scheduled for Wednesday evening in the multipurpose room of the recreation center that smelled like floor cleaner and old ambition, and Ivy would have ignored it if not for the fact that Kyle had texted her the day before from a number that still had the hospital recorded as an ice-cream truck on her phone. He wrote: Re the encroachment language. It\u2019s dumb. We can fix it with an arborist clause. I don\u2019t know how to say that in human. Can you come. The message had the grammar of someone trying to be less awful, and she surprised herself by wanting to help. So she went and sat in the second row because the first row was for people who wanted to be seen and the third was for people who wanted to be unseen, and she did not want either condition. Kyle arrived late on his crutches and took a chair with a clatter, and when the agenda item came up\u2014trees, always trees\u2014he cleared his throat and then turned a dull pink. He did not have a speech, thank God, but he had the sentence, \u201cWe should require consultation before we require cutting,\u201d and he looked at Ivy and then away, and she found her hand lifting like a schoolgirl\u2019s. She said, \u201cWhen we treat living things like infractions, we make more trouble than we solve,\u201d and then, because she knew the room liked practical talk and proof, she told them about the crack inside the branch they couldn\u2019t see and the way Diego had seen it, and how the difference between reckless and careful was an hour and a ladder and someone who knew. She did not raise her voice. She did not apologize for having a voice. The board nodded in that way boards nod when they are thinking of liability and also of their children walking to the school bus, and the motion passed with a speed that made the whole thing seem easy. After, Kyle limped over and said, \u201cYou\u2019re useful,\u201d and she smiled in spite of this being a stupid compliment and said, \u201cSo are you,\u201d because a man on crutches saying I was wrong was not a thing she had seen often in rooms like this and deserved to be named.\n\nThursday morning came in a gray that meant business. The river smelled like someone had stirred it and released old stories. Jess wore a raincoat the vivid yellow of school buses and children\u2019s drawings of suns, and her braid did in fact have the tension of a seatbelt. At the end of the pier, the water taxi sat squat and confident, its hull making a sound against the pilings like chewing gum. The handful of passengers were not paying attention to courage; they were tourists with cameras and a man with earbuds who probably did this commute daily and had opinions about the captain\u2019s docking technique. Ivy took the step from wood to deck and felt the floor flex and then catch as if it had been waiting for her personally. She did not want to cry because crying felt like telling the world it had more power than it ought to, but she allowed one large breath to leave her in a way that made the skin on her arms release. Jess handed her a ginger candy and she did not unwrap it yet; she liked the weight of it in her palm like a promise. They stood by the rail because sitting seemed too much like submission, and when the boat pulled away the rope thunked against the cleat, a small violence quickly forgiven, and the water parted with no drama, like a curtain used to being asked.\n\nThey slid past the Torpedo Factory with its industrious ghosts, past a couple holding hands in a manner that suggested newness, past a knot of geese who had decided to be decorative. When they came under the flight path, which they did, because everything in this region eventually finds itself under a flight path, a plane came down toward Reagan with its landing gear out like a polite gesture. The noise passed over them like a weather pattern, loud but not punitive, and Ivy felt the old gallop begin and did not hop off the train of her body like she often did; she stayed on, watching the scenery go by, naming objects the way you might to a child learning words: bridge, gull, paddleboarder, sky. Jess, beside her, let her hand rest on the rail close to Ivy\u2019s, not touching, but near enough that contact could be made with the simplest adjustment. Ivy did not take it. She also did not step away. The boat made a wake and the wake tidied itself; this delighted her beyond reason, the way water could erase its own convulsions if given a minute. \u201cLook,\u201d Jess said softly, pointing to a man throwing a line around a cleat with the accuracy of someone who had done it a thousand times, \u201cHe could do that asleep,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cSo could my lizard brain,\u201d and Jess snorted and then turned the snort into a cough to be polite.\n\nAt The Wharf, the docks presented themselves like a catalogue of possibilities, ice cream and oysters and a soap store that made its products in the shapes of food, and they walked on boards slick with an earlier drizzle and bought coffee in cups as thin as self-esteem and sat on a bench far enough from the music that Ivy did not feel bossed by it. The river moved with purpose; boats came and went like thoughts. They were old enough to not require an itinerary and young enough to still make one in their heads. Jess told a story about a student who had tried to flirt with her by explaining cryptocurrency and Ivy laughed in a way that startled a pigeon into pretending it had meant to leave anyway. They took the eleven-fifty back and Jess put the ginger candy into Ivy\u2019s mouth without being asked, and the sweet burned a little and then did its quieting work, and Ivy watched the Watergate pass like a sentence someone had decided to leave alone and found that this made her kind toward it.\n\nThe day after the boat, in a fit of goodwill toward bureaucracy, Ivy offered to help Diego with his small business grant application, a pile of papers that asked questions like, Please quantify your passion in forms fields that only accepted whole numbers. He sat at her dining table with the careful posture he used when something was important and tried not to expose his discomfort with clauses. \u201cThey want me to say mission,\u201d he said, rubbing the bridge of his nose as if a headache might be coaxed into gentleness, \u201cI hate mission. I am not a church.\u201d Ivy drew a little ladder next to the word and said, \u201cCall it what you do when you\u2019re tired,\u201d and he said, \u201cI go outside,\u201d and she said, \u201cThen write that,\u201d and he grinned and put it down in a nugget of tidy handwriting that would be easy to love if you were reading grants for a living. They framed his work as preventing ugliness, which pleased him, and as supporting native plants, which pleased someone official somewhere, and as employing high schoolers in the summer, which made him scratch his cheek and look away because the idea of having to be a boss filled him with genuine horror. When they were done, he looked at the stack and whistled low like a man who had seen a ship built by hands and was impressed on behalf of the hands. \u201cI will owe you an orange,\u201d he said, and she said, \u201cTwo,\u201d and he gave her three because he liked the math of generosity.\n\nThe moonflower opened on a Tuesday for the night-shift nurse\u2019s yard as if it had been waiting for the exact right temperature of breeze, and Diego took Ivy to see it because some things demanded witnesses. They stood in the dusk with the fence quietly verifying its purpose and the jasmine leaning into its own perfume like someone who believed in themselves but only in the dark. The white cups of the moonflower unfurled with a patience that felt instructive; not slow, exactly, but careful, like someone undoing a knot without breaking it. The nurse came out and held her hand over her mouth like she was stopping a word from escaping and then said, \u201cYou came,\u201d as if she were still surprised that people might, and they drank small paper cups of lemonade that had more sugar than necessary because sweetness is a form of defiance. Ivy breathed in and felt how her lungs could be obedient and also wild, and she thought of the boat moving on the river in the low light, the wake smoothing its panic, and she put a hand to her chest like an idiot and then refused to apologize for being one. On the way home she drove with the windows cracked and the air laid a cool line along her forearm where the sleeve ended, and she kept her eyes on the road and did not check the sky for threats, not because they weren\u2019t there, but because she was choosing not to choreograph her anxiety that evening.\n\nA week later, one of the children in the program went missing for seven terrible minutes that extended like elastic and threatened to snap. Bryce had been reading in an attitude of reluctant concentration and then he was not in his chair and not at the water fountain and not in the men\u2019s restroom where Mason knocked and then entered with an apology so crisp it could have cut paper. Maritza did the thing where she wrote the time on a scrap of paper and made the kind of face people make when their job is to be the adult in a room with adults. Ivy felt the first cold dart of adrenaline and remembered that it is supposed to be helpful, that its job is not to punish but to sharpen. She walked the aisles of the stacks on the far side of the magazine racks and then lowered herself onto her knees and looked under the table in the study room and there he was, curled around a book as if it were a baby animal, hiding in that way children do when the world is too large\u2014under a thing, shrinking the sky. \u201cHey,\u201d she said softly, a voice she saved for times when she did not want to increase the size of mistakes. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring out where you are.\u201d Bryce looked at her like someone thwarted and said, \u201cYou knew how to find me,\u201d and she said, \u201cI have a map of you in my head,\u201d and he rolled his eyes with infinite disdain and crawled out and said, \u201cI was not hiding,\u201d and she said, \u201cI will agree to that lie,\u201d and the relief passed through her like a hot drink. Maritza made a note later about doors and sweeps and ways to be more explicit about how one leaves a room and the next day she posted a sign that said, \u201cIf you are going to be in the bunker, tell your captain,\u201d which Bryce pretended not to see and then pointed to with a smirk three times in the week that followed.\n\nThere were other days when the body was less willing to be trained and Ivy accepted that the training would be lifelong and possibly the point. In the freezer aisle of the grocery store a documentary played on the tiny screen embedded in a display of pre-sauced pastas, showing a wing flexing as if it were demonstrating the right answer, and her hands went immediately into the cold place as if she could freeze the panic out of them. An old woman in a sweatsuit with rhinestones that spelled out an imperative\u2014SHINE\u2014was deciding between two brands of peas and said, \u201cThey get you with the lighting,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cThey do,\u201d and that was enough to be not alone. At the car she sat for a moment and then wrote Tuesday fear in her notebook with the kind of handwriting she used when she wanted to change her brain with the power of neat letters, and she put a star next to it and the star was sloppy and she let it be.\n\nRuth had her own crack in the branch and it announced itself in the parking garage of her office building when the elevator made a noise at the sixth floor and stopped and then did nothing. She called Ivy afterward, already in her car because she had walked down the stairs like a queen leaving a throne she\u2019d never wanted, and said, \u201cI cried in the elevator with strangers and a man offered me a cough drop,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cIf heaven is anything, it is a place where strangers have cough drops,\u201d and Ruth laughed and then inhaled too sharply because laughter had been a surprise. \u201cI did not enjoy being about to not be in charge,\u201d she said, and Ivy said, \u201cNobody does,\u201d and then they talked about the merits of taking a moment to unstick one\u2019s tongue from the roof of one\u2019s mouth, which is a thing both had learned in different rooms for different reasons. Later that week they sat on Ivy\u2019s couch with the OKAY mug between them like a joint custody agreement and read a sonnet their father had loved, flipping the book of Shakespeare with the familiarity of two people who had watched a man thumb these same pages in a truck\u2019s half light. \u201cWhen in disgrace with fortune and men\u2019s eyes,\u201d Ruth read, and Ivy finished \u201cI all alone beweep my outcast state,\u201d and they made faces at the word beweep because some words need to be mocked to be properly cherished, and when they reached the couplet, the way love makes the morning sing like a lark high out of the sullen earth, Ruth cleared her throat in a manner that signaled a decision had been made to be moved and said, \u201cI hate that he could make a person feel better with ten seconds of vowels,\u201d and Ivy handed her the mug as if it contained not tea but permission.\n\nThe invitation to present at a tiny conference for regional librarians came via Maritza, who had the gleeful look of someone nominating a friend for an award that came with a mug. \u201cIt\u2019s at The Wharf,\u201d she said, which made the suggestion feel like a good omen, and the email included a phrase that cracked Ivy open a little: We are interested in programs that articulate courage without spectacle. She said yes before she thought about who else would be on the bill, before she thought about what wearing a blazer under lights might do to her armpits, before her brain had time to spin out scenarios in which she stood up and forgot every story as if she had been unplugged. After she hung up, she put her forehead against the front door because it was cool and solid and she whispered, \u201cOkay,\u201d and did not bother with the second okay because sometimes once is enough if you have just been brave at a keyboard.\n\nOn an afternoon when the air had the metallic taste of imminent storm, she saw Kyle crouched in her front yard examining the place where the foxglove had decided to exist. He was not wearing his crutch, which meant something about his leg had amended itself, or perhaps it meant he was being stubborn. \u201cIt looks like a church,\u201d he said without greeting, nodding at the foxglove\u2019s bells. \u201cAnd like a warning.\u201d Ivy stood next to him and bent her knees to see the plant at its own height, a perspective that made most things more comprehensible. \u201cDiego says not to eat it,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is the sort of advice that makes you wonder who he knows who would.\u201d Kyle snorted. He had the air of someone permanently embarrassed to have been saved, which turned out to be a decent foundation for a personality if you were willing to sand off the arrogance on the edges. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch the oaks over on Muir Lane,\u201d he said, apropos of nothing, \u201cA guy wanted them down because acorns hit his roof and scared his dog. I told him we support dog feelings and also that the trees were a hundred years old, and he said, \u2018So what,\u2019 and I said, \u2018So everything,\u2019 and it was a very profound moment for me.\u201d Ivy said, \u201cYou are becoming a person I could invite to a brunch,\u201d and he looked briefly proud and then said, \u201cI hate brunch,\u201d and she said, \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nThe day of the presentation came in hot and damp and full of traffic that considered the law one opinion among many. The room at The Wharf was one of those rooms that wanted to be a boat when it grew up, full of wood and light and the faint smell of sea air manufactured by a machine. Maritza introduced Ivy with adjectives that made her want to leave and when Ivy walked to the lectern she carried the OKAY mug because it felt like an amulet and also because she had decided to be a person who did not mind being seen with her magic. She spoke about Maps and Journeys and the boy who said he was going to go big at home, about the girl who drew a river that was a snake and then learned that rivers love a path, about making a room feel like a bunker and then teaching the children to announce their location because privacy is not always safety. She did not use the word trauma because she did not like to throw it around a room where not everyone had signed a waiver. She used the word care so many times it lost its edges and became what she needed it to be: both a verb and a noun, both something you offer and something you require. She told them about the night-blooming garden because it said something better than she could about timing and desire and gentle insistence. She said the sentence, \u201cCourage is a trickle, catch it in teacups,\u201d and saw Jess, who had snuck into a chair in the back, lift her hand and make the shape of a cup in the air and she did not cry. When she finished, the room did that thing where it made a sound like held breath turning into clapping, and a woman with a lanyard that would have strangled a horse came up and said, \u201cWe needed that,\u201d which is a combination of words that can get you through a week if you are careful.\n\nOn the walk back to the dock, Jess asked whether the water taxi counted as communion and Ivy said it did and also that she would not mind ice cream because she wanted sugar the way freshly brave people want to celebrate with something benign. They ate standing up, the cone dripping a little, and watched a thunderhead assemble itself like a gathering committee. The boat came and they got on and Ivy chose the same place at the rail as before because she liked to repeat rituals when they had worked. The storm held off while they slid across the surface, the edges of the waves rippling with that jade green that made the Potomac look briefly like a better river than it was. As they passed under the planes again, a jet came low enough that Ivy could see the burned belly smudges and the handprint of heat on the metal, and she felt the tightness and then she was able to consider the tightness without becoming it. She thought of a thing her father had once said when they were caught on I-95 behind a truck that smelled like pigs, the very definition of a misery: \u201cWe are in this life together with other people,\u201d and he had said it not as a comfort but as a practical assessment, and she held the sentence like a rail until the plane became less loud and the boat pulled into the dock with that small cough ships make when they\u2019ve done their job.\n\nBy August the spruces had become background again, which is a sign of healing one forgets to honor. The robin fledged and the nest remained as a sculpture of the moment before adulthood, and occasionally a squirrel stuck its face in, perplexed, as if it had been promised something more interesting. The grant came through for Diego with a check that looked smaller than it was because money is never as impressive as work, and he bought a printer that made letters that did not look like a crime and a pair of loppers so shiny they would have been illegal in some countries. He hired a teenager with a mustache that had not yet committed to itself and a girl named Ines who wore a bandanna like a crown and told the men what to do with the calm of an air traffic controller, and Ivy watched the way he learned to say, \u201cWe,\u201d instead of, \u201cI,\u201d and wondered how many times in a life you got that lesson before it took.\n\nThe pirate boy in Austin sent another postcard, this one a drawing of a boat with a ferry sign on it in letters that leaned into the wind. The note, dictated but clearly his: If pirates go to therapy they talk about why they like the boat and also why the boat forgot to be kind. I went on a boat that did not steal. It was okay. The R in therapy had fully healed. Ivy put it on the fridge next to the cow with boots and, almost without thinking, she added a doodle of a cup with little handles like ears and wrote under it in small letters, more, and she did not explain to herself exactly what she meant.\n\nWhen school started and the library filled with the friction of formal learning, the program shifted to a late afternoon hum. Teen volunteers in hoodies arrived with new arcs of exhaustion under their eyes and an increased capacity for making lists that had unnecessary boxes to check. Ivy found herself teaching the same lesson in three costumes: to a seven-year-old about how to break a paragraph into thought-bites, to a ninth grader about how to take the good of a story and leave the nonsense, to a father about how to not stand in the doorway with his arms crossed while his daughter did long division, and the repeat saved her time and also did not because people require customization like computers. She began to wear a thin gold chain Ruth had given her with a charm the shape of a small half-circle. \u201cIt\u2019s the other half of all the things you think you have to finish,\u201d Ruth had said, and Ivy had laughed too loudly and then swallowed the laugh like something hot, and when she touched the charm she remembered to stop at half sometimes and not call it failure.\n\nThere were days when she thought of airports and did not go floppy inside. There were days when she could step into the shadow of the highway sign without thinking of bolts working themselves free out of boredom. There were nights when she woke with her heart galloping and counted backward from one hundred by seven and could not get past seventy-nine and forgave herself for missing some numbers. She did not make a new appointment with a virtual reality therapist and she did not cancel the calendar reminder about it; both decisions felt like progress in the mildest possible way. She took the train to visit a friend in Richmond and stood on the platform feeling a hair\u2019s breadth brave, which is enough for a day. The conductor, a woman in a hat that made her look like a person you could give a mission to, punched her ticket and said, \u201cYou\u2019ll like the curve near Fredericksburg, it makes the river look like it isn\u2019t mad at you anymore,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cI accept that,\u201d and she stood and watched the way trees blur into coherence when you allow them to.\n\nOne evening in September, the light went saturated and golden as if the day were apologizing for having been humid, and Ivy and Jess and Diego sat on Ivy\u2019s front steps with their feet on the concrete like a youth group. Jess had taken out her braid and looked, improbably, younger, wild hair announcing that none of this had been easy and it had also not been a loss. Diego had a splinter he was refusing to tweeze because he believed in the body spitting out what didn\u2019t belong, and he held his finger up to the light like a tiny judge. A neighbor boy practiced skateboard tricks in the street with a little death wish and a strong helmet, and their talk went the way talk goes when it isn\u2019t trying to be forced into a moral. Jess told them about a mother who had said her latte tasted like failure and meant that her daughter was not where she was supposed to be in algebra. Diego told them about a woman who had asked him to put in fake plants because she did not trust herself not to kill the real ones and how he had nodded and then put in three pots of rosemary anyway because he wanted her to forgive herself for being herself. Ivy talked about Bryce reading without making war noises for twenty minutes and then looking up and saying, \u201cI don\u2019t hate this as much,\u201d and how that sometimes feels like the length of a person\u2019s progress in any given category, and the three of them put the backs of their heads against the door and looked up where the planes drew invisible lines between places they were not required to be. The spruces, dignified and a little heroic in their patched places, made the sound of wind dragging its fingers through intention. The foxglove had given up its bells for the season and was preparing invisibly for later. Someone nearby was grilling something that smelled like forgiveness. The day slid toward evening, and they let it, and no one stood up to make it do anything else.",

                              "content": "The first cool snap arrived like a rumor that turned out to be true. In the mornings, the dew slicked the grass and made the concrete steps look confident, and the air had enough bite to make Ivy think of splitting wood, which she had never done and possibly never would, but the thought of a pile of ready kindling satisfied some ancient part of her that liked stacks. The library program shifted with the school year into afternoons that felt like the long exhale after lunch, the building filling with the friction of backpacks and the soft aggression of sneakers. Maritza hung a new sign on the door that said in her own blocky hand More Reading, Less Apologizing, and parents smiled in that helpless way that meant they did not know whether it was addressed to them. Ivy added a row of clipboards to the wall because clipboards made teenagers feel like their tasks were adult, and Mason color-coded the markers until the spectrum pleased his sense of order so deeply he had to take a picture and file it somewhere labeled Satisfaction.\n\nA letter from the HOA arrived with uncharacteristic cheer. It was an invitation to the fall block party and a request for volunteers that read like a ransom note. Ivy read it twice and then texted Jess a photo because the line about \u201cbringing your famous dish\u201d was arrogant in a community where people\u2019s famous dishes rarely deserved the adjective. Kyle had signed it with a black pen that bled through like enthusiasm. When Ivy saw him later on the sidewalk, he lifted his crutch slightly in greeting\u2014he was almost done with it, a fact he flaunted like a temporary tattoo\u2014and said, \u201cWe bought biodegradable forks,\u201d as if this might absolve him of past sins. She told him she would bring deviled eggs because she had accidentally made them famous in her family, and his eyes widened as if fame were a quality he did not want to be responsible for witnessing.\n\nJess burned her hand on a Friday in the way that happens when speed and hot instruments occupy the same square foot of real estate. It was not dramatic\u2014no trip to the ER, no bandage that invited strangers to ask for the tale\u2014but it was bad enough that she called Ivy from the back of the shop with her voice pitched low to keep the regulars from panicking about their espresso. \u201cCan you be a person who pretends to be a barista for a day?\u201d she asked, and Ivy said yes before she could remember that the machine hissed like a cat and liked to be coaxed the way stubborn children liked to be coaxed. She found herself behind the counter in an apron that still held the smell of lemon oil and milk, taking cash with the speed of someone who respects exact change and nodding at people like she knew their complicated regular orders by heart. A man in a blazer ordered a cortado and explained how much he hated the word mouthfeel, and a woman with lipstick as immaculate as a vow said quietly that she needed her latte to taste like success and then smiled, embarrassed by the metaphor that had escaped. An airline pilot came in with a rolling suitcase and a cap under his arm and a posture that suggested he had been trained to keep strangers calm, and when he said, \u201cDouble shot, room for cream,\u201d without glancing up from his phone, Ivy felt the quick cold bloom in her chest and then watched it recede as she tamped the grounds with the tender aggression Jess had taught her, steam wobbling the air. The pilot left a dollar and said, \u201cYou\u2019re quick,\u201d as if speed were a moral virtue, and Jess, bandage tucked into her sleeve, leaned against the back counter and mouthed the word hero with exaggerated irony, making Ivy snort so loudly a scone-wielding teenager looked up, satisfied to have caught an adult misbehaving.\n\nDiego roped her into a rooftop job for a restaurant down by the tracks that wanted to grow herbs like confidence. He pretended it was a standard garden but then mentioned the ladder in a tone that let her decide whether she was in the mood to be brave. \u201cIt\u2019s low,\u201d he said, \u201cYou can see the whole parking lot and the train. The sky makes a face at you, but it\u2019s not rude.\u201d She said yes because ladders had been a small private battlefield since she was nine and her father had asked her to hand him a hammer on the second rung and she had frozen and he had not been unkind about it. The restaurant\u2019s roof was a square of gravel and tar with rails too thin to feel trustworthy, and when she stepped up and the world widened, her knees made their preliminary complaint, but the rest of her body busied itself with the practicalities. The planters needed lining. The soil needed to be lifted from bags without tearing them into confetti. Diego had labeled seedlings with pencil on sticks because he believed in the tenderness of graphite. They crouched and worked with the ceremony of people doing something unremarkable that would become remarkable later to a diner who tasted basil that had known a train whistle. When a freight train blared below them and the roof vibrated in solidarity, she put a hand flat on the tar and found that touching the thing that felt unstable helped. Diego said nothing because he had learned when to leave space in the soundtrack, and when they came down the ladder he made her pause on the last rung and feel both feet on two planes before adding the third, so that the body learned a choreography that announced itself as useful.\n\nBryce found her on the third day of September with a paper that looked like it had been attacked by a flock of red pens. \u201cMy teacher thinks I\u2019m messy,\u201d he said, presenting the carnage with the resigned pride of someone who knew he had made a mess and also that messes were sometimes interesting. Ivy read the comments like small footnotes on a bigger story and then turned the paper over and drew him a box and said, \u201cThis is the place your ideas go before they practice being tidy,\u201d and Bryce said, \u201cLike a waiting room,\u201d and she said, \u201cYes, and there\u2019s no old magazines,\u201d and they looked at each other with the relief of a metaphor that put its coat on and sat down. He came two afternoons in a row without complaint, which was the closest he could come to adoration, and his mother stood in the doorway with a face like someone who had expected a fight and been offered soup. Ivy wanted to say to her, not all of this needs to be an emergency, but then the woman\u2019s phone chimed with a text that made her eyes go wide and sorry and Ivy did not say anything about emergencies to anyone because some days were just a stack you didn\u2019t have the right shelf for.\n\nFor the block party, Ivy made seventy-two deviled eggs and then realized she had not left any for herself to fail at later and had to swipe two halves off the tray at the edge of the rec center while no one was looking. People arrived with food and folding chairs and the kind of lawn games that require either two beers or none to be tolerable. Kids drew chalk roads down the middle of Prospect Court toward a drain that became a lake in their heads. Someone had rented a bounce house, and Ivy watched it inflate with the slow awakening of something cheerful, the blower whining like a hairdryer having an opinion. Kyle set up a table for a silent auction to benefit the teen center and put out a sign-up sheet for stew-making after the weather decided to behave like a story about fall. He limped a little, favoring the leg not because it hurt anymore but because his body had liked the drama and was reluctant to surrender it. He cornered Ivy by the lemonade vat and said, \u201cThe arborist clause passed,\u201d and she said, \u201cLook at you, making reasonable things,\u201d and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible habit,\u201d and then he stared at her tray and added, \u201cThese are famous,\u201d in a tone that made her want to ruin them on purpose just to reset the myth. Diego arrived with a crate of late tomatoes that looked like planets and did not write a price anywhere because he wanted people to ask him and he wanted to have the pleasure of saying, \u201cPay me what feels like gratitude.\u201d Jess wore a bandana over her burn and took the microphone at some point to thank people for bringing things that could be eaten with forks that would not haunt the creek, and Ivy found herself with tears at the point on her cheekbone that wetness always surprised, not because the speech was good\u2014it was\u2014but because the sound system cut out halfway and Jess kept talking anyway as if the voice itself were enough, and people leaned in, the way you do when the story requires you.\n\nAfter dark, a string of lights made the street look like a wedding. Teenagers pretended to disdain the cornhole game and then went into sudden raptures when a beanbag hit wood with the right force and angle, the physics of their own bodies briefly pleasing them. Mrs. Dalrymple arrived late in a jacket the color of costly wine and and made loud evaluations of people\u2019s coleslaw with a friendliness that undermined the cruelty. She told Ivy that the foxglove on her front walk looked like a choir, and when Ivy said, \u201cPlease don\u2019t eat it,\u201d Mrs. Dalrymple looked personally offended and said, \u201cI am not a goat,\u201d and then kissed the air in Ivy\u2019s direction as if that ended the matter. Jess pressed a small envelope into Ivy\u2019s hand with the gravity of a graduate handing over a diploma; inside was a gift certificate printed in the coffee shop font for One Future Espresso on the House, redeemable at the moment you are a person who gets on a plane. Ivy folded it into her wallet like a pressed leaf, refused to look at its future too directly, and decided not to tell anyone about it in case she needed to let it live as possibility without dying under the weight of witnesses.\n\nOn a Saturday that surprised everyone by being clear and gentle, Ivy took Ruth on the train to Richmond and did not make it a test in her head. Ruth appeared on the platform with two coffees and a scarf that made her look like she had important opinions about galleries, and when the train glided in like a well-adjusted animal, they got on without inventing rituals. They faced each other, the way siblings sometimes forget they prefer to, and the countryside began its polite blur. Ruth told a story about a bid protest that had been written in such excellent passive voice that she\u2019d considered framing it, and Ivy told her about the pirate boy\u2019s ferries and the way the night-blooming garden had offered her a religion she could live with. They spoke of their father without landing on whether he\u2019d been good at everything or just good at it often enough to fool their hearts. Ruth admitted, in a tone that suggested data rather than confession, that she had counted tiles on the elevator floor while it stalled and named them by color to stay in place, and Ivy told her the trick about Tuesday fear and they decided fear kept a schedule like trash pickup and sometimes you took the bins out and sometimes it rained and you brought them back in without shame. In Richmond they walked past their old haunt where murals changed with the seasons until one of them stuck, and the bakery where at nineteen Ivy had learned that croissants can heal some evils and not others. On the return train they sat with their knees just touching, an old level of intimacy neither of them had had the right to since they were girls in the backseat of a car with no air conditioning and a father who sang like a person who had swallowed a radio. They promised nothing to each other because promising sometimes made things break, and yet both walked away agreeing silently to repair what could be repaired.\n\nThe first cold rain arrived with a temper. It drove people into the library with hair that had given up and cardigans carried like infants and the insistence that the Internet was a right. In the children\u2019s room a toddler howled until his mother put a board book in his hands that had a mirror, and then he howled at his own face with pleasure. An older man fell asleep in a chair and made an occasional noise like a drawer opening and closing. Ivy was halfway through explaining to a fifth grader that metaphors were like costumes that made some truths easier to say when a boy in the corner began to cough. It would have been a small event except that the cough became an insistence and then a problem, and his sister\u2019s face went white in the way that makes a room concentrate. Ivy crossed to them with the speed she saved for emergencies, announced herself calmly because panic likes to be introduced to its opponent, and put her hand on the boy\u2019s back with the firm motion that reminds a body where it is. He\u2019d put too many dry pretzels in his mouth and his brain had staged a protest; the sister said, \u201cHe does that,\u201d and Ivy had the glamorous vision of herself doing the Heimlich in front of the biographies and then decided glamour had killed more sensible decisions than anyone cared to admit. She asked him to cough again in a tone that implied trust, and when he did the pretzel moved, the room resumed its regular noise, and someone clapped quietly near the tax forms because people like to turn relief into a ceremony. The boy\u2019s mother arrived from the copier with a stack of papers and the look of someone whose morning had tried to escape, and Ivy showed her her hand and said, \u201cWe were here,\u201d and the mother swallowed and nodded the nod that lives at the border of gratitude and embarrassment, and later Maritza stuck her head into Ivy\u2019s cubbyhole and said, \u201cYou should teach a class called Do Not Make a Spectacle of Yourself for Love,\u201d and Ivy laughed, the sound clipping off at the end like a bird changing direction in midair.\n\nThe ferris wheel at National Harbor announced itself to her in postcards and social media photos and the lit-up nights she could see from the water taxi. Its lights stacked in a circle like good intentions. Jess, with a smirk that said she knew when to offer temptation and when to back away, mentioned that standing under it and watching the cars rise could be a way to make friends with the idea of height without requiring heroism. Ivy let the suggestion sit on the table between them like a plate of cookies that might be a prank. On an evening so clear it felt dehydrated, they took the water taxi with the ease of people whose bodies had learned a trick and walked to the base of the wheel. Children hopped with the nervous energy of older electricity. A man proposed to a woman with a ring that looked like it would be exhausting to keep track of and two strangers applauded as if romance were a sport. Jess kept a hand in her coat pocket and did not reach out for Ivy, a master class in not crowding. Ivy stepped forward until she was close enough to hear the carriage doors shut and the hydraulic hiss that accompanied ascent, and she watched the mechanics behave themselves, the way the giant equipment did its diligent work. She pictured herself inside one of the cars and her body did its opening maneuver and then its closing one, and she said, softly, \u201cNot today,\u201d and Jess said, \u201cI like today,\u201d and they stood and let the wheel turn above them, both of them looking up like children forgiven something without anyone having to name it.\n\nWhen the conference organizers sent a link to a video of Ivy\u2019s talk\u2014a thing she had not known would exist\u2014she did not watch it for three days. The icon sat on her desktop like a small eye. She finally made tea and waited until the house felt like a church after a service and clicked play with a face so set in concentration she looked, to herself, like someone trying to move furniture with telepathy. She watched her own mouth shape the sentences and did not throw up. She observed that she used her hands less than she thought and moved her head like a pigeon when she was pleased and said \u201cum\u201d fewer times than her private enemies would have preferred. She listened to her voice talk about care and maps and about not needing to produce a spectacle to prove one\u2019s courage. She thought about the girl who had asked whether she would never fly again and felt no need to answer more fully now than she had then. When the video ended, she closed the screen gently and let the room refill with regular air. She put the OKAY mug in the sink because it had done its duty by watching, and then she opened the email from the virtual reality therapist and typed: Thank you for the brochure. I am not ready to book, but I am ready to talk about what ready might look like. She sent it before the part of her that loved to hold onto the edges could snatch the action back.\n\nDiego began a project with a high school environmental club that had somehow convinced the principal to let them tear up a strip of useless lawn and put in a rain garden. He asked Ivy to help the kids write the signs because after a lifetime of reading seed packets he respected fonts, and she brought a bag of stencils, which felt like an admission of being a certain kind of person. The teenagers came at the work with knees and elbows and snacks and the kind of intense fairness that makes adults nostalgic and tired, and they argued briefly over whether labeling a plant Joe-Pye weed was rude. Ines, now promoted to the role of assistant who did not suffer fools, stood with a clipboard and refused to accept any label that did not include the Latin name because she believed in dignity even for perennials. They put their hands in the dirt and pulled up a piece of plastic buried so deep it felt like an fossilized mistake, and when the hole filled with water after a rain and behaved like a pond, they watched bees land for a drink and cheered in a circle like a team with a mascot Ivy would have loved to see. When the principal came by, robust with good public relations, and said, \u201cWhat we need is stewardship,\u201d Diego nodded and did not say that what he needed was more shovels and a way to pay Ines more than a teenager\u2019s respectable wage, and Ivy wrote on a sign in the tidiest letters she owned: You are here. The water is here. We want both to be here later, too.\n\nOn a Thursday with a sky the color of laundry left too long in the basket, an email arrived from the Austin family with a video attached. The boy stood in a kitchen that had the exact same kind of lamp Ivy had once recommended for better reading light and read a paragraph from Treasure Island in a voice that had widened. He looked at the camera at the end and said, \u201cTherapy for pirates is not working but it is funny,\u201d and then he added a PS that had been obviously staged by Liam: We are proud of you for boats. Ivy watched it four times and grieved in a controlled and generous way, which is to say she did not punish herself with the kind of longing that had often run her days when she was younger. She wrote back that she had found a ferry that did not lie about what it was, and that she would send him a drawing of a boat with accurate proportions, and she drew one and it was ridiculous and the perspective was wrong and she sent it anyway.\n\nAutumn deepened its voice and the trees in Burke did their quiet work. The spruces showed off less because their job was to endure and they did not collect Instagram likes. The foxglove yellowed and let its own seeds go, a letting that impressed Ivy so much that she knelt and watched for an indecorous amount of time, the pods letting go with confidence, like a person stepping off a bus in a new city with the address written on the inside of their wrist. The rosemary remained itself, as if it had signed a contract with the season. Ivy put her hand to it every time she left the house, the fingers slow on the spines, and sometimes she put her hand to it upon return too, as if asking to be accepted back into a life that was more and more of her own making. When planes passed in twos, she noticed and did not always organize her breath around them. When the elevator at the municipal building made a lurchy sound and she was inside it, she closed her eyes and counted to six and then to ten and then they were at the right floor and she did not have to develop a new religion to explain her survival. When Jess left a box on her porch with a note that read For bravery hangovers and inside was a loaf of cinnamon bread so soft it offended physics, Ivy sat on the steps and tore off a heel and ate it without plate or plan, and the day sat next to her like a friend who meant well and did not always know what to do with their hands.\n\nNovember announced its seriousness with a wind that wanted to argue. The library put up a display of cookbooks and novels with pies on the cover that made Mason roll his eyes until Amina rolled hers right back and reminded him that gratitude is allowed to be corny if it feeds you. Ivy made a list that included words like brine and nutmeg and the phrase forgive the dryness if the turkey forgets itself, and then added a line under it in smaller script: remember to be kind to the part of you that is still standing at Gate C23. She did not read it every morning like a magic spell. She read it sometimes and then forgot and then remembered, which seemed to be the way of all the important things. The program put up a map of the neighborhood and asked people to pin the place where they had been brave in an unremarkable way. Pins clustered at the bus stop, at the coffee shop, in the aisles of the grocery store where the freezer section television showed an airplane wing quivering dutifully over polite pasta. A child pinned a spot on the sidewalk outside the rec center and wrote in a blocky hand: Here I told the big kids no, and Ivy wanted to put a crown on the pin. Someone pinned the roof of the restaurant, and she knew it was Diego because his dot was slightly to the left of where it should have been, his superstition against exactness showing itself at last.\n\nOn the morning before Thanksgiving, Ruth called from her car with the sound of tires making that rice-cracker crunch over cold leaves. \u201cI am on the wrong highway on purpose,\u201d she announced, and Ivy said, \u201cBlessings on your father\u2019s favorite sin,\u201d and Ruth laughed in a way that made you forgive whatever you hadn\u2019t liked about your day. They proposed a plan to throw their family at the holiday without allowing the holiday to throw itself at them. There would be a table. There would be a prayer in the form of a toast. There would be a pie with a crack that meant integrity. Ivy would bring deviled eggs and not apologize for the paprika being uneven. Jess would show up late with a loaf of bread still warm because she had her own kind of liturgy to perform with a machine and a few miracles. Diego would stop by with a bag of herbs and refuse to sit down because his body did not trust chairs when there were tasks. Kyle would arrive and stand awkwardly in the doorway as if gratitude required a permission slip, and someone would hand him a plate and he would discover he liked cranberry sauce in the way of men who have avoided fruit on principle and then give up. They would go around and say things because that is what people who try do, and when it came to Ivy she would speak carefully and without spectacle. She would say, \u201cI am grateful for the ground matching my feet most of the time,\u201d and someone would laugh and someone would look at her as if she had said the true name of a thing, and she would feel, not fixed, but located. Afterwards, she would stand at her sink and wash plates with a rhythm that was close to joy, the kind that lets your mind unspool something it had kept too tightly, and outside a plane would sew its red and white lights in a neat pattern and she would look up and wave with two fingers, not out of defiance, but out of recognition. The night would be a lake again, and sometimes lakes reflect the sky and sometimes they keep their secrets. She would be all right with both.",

Leaves that ought to have surrendered weeks ago clung like stubborn thoughts to the oaks along Ox Road. The air had a clean edge that made Ivy think of knives sharpened in the backs of kitchens, competent and not malicious. In the library, Mason put away a display of harvest books with cranberries on their covers and replaced them with titles about snow and soup, arranging them with such ceremonial satisfaction that Amina murmured, \u201cLet the man build his winter altar,\u201d and did not say all the things she thought about how every book about snow ignored the sludgy truth of parking lots. Ivy moved slowly in the new cold, every breath a rehearsal for a speech she would not have to give.\n\nAt home, she took the last of the deviled eggs out of the refrigerator and ate them over the sink with a kind of reverence that felt almost religious in its specificity. She washed the tray and set it on the rack to dry and realized she liked this part better than the part where she was admired for paprika. The quiet after doing had always been her favorite hymn. She wiped the counter with the flat of her palm rather than the rag because some days the skin wanted to prove it could touch the world and be fine, and then she went to the door and pressed her fingers into the rosemary until the scent lifted into her nose like a reminder that you could ruin and still be fragrant.\n\nDecember came in like the person at a party who knocks quietly and then ends up staying long enough to help do the dishes. The coffee shop filled with people who wore good coats and wanted small square pastries that cracked like polite secrets. Jess chose the longest night of the year the way some people choose an argument to end, and declared a vigil for anyone who wanted to sit with a hot thing in their hands and say out loud a line from a book that made the dark feel like a visitor instead of a landlord. Ivy brought her father\u2019s battered Shakespeare, the sonnets half dog-eared, half asleep. She stood in the soft lantern light of the shop with the rest of them\u2014Kyle in a sweater that revealed he owned one, Diego holding a small wreath made entirely of rosemary, a teenager who had sworn allegiance to eyeliner reciting a line from Dickinson about the zero at the bone\u2014and when it was her turn she read about the lark, that thawed thing that stands in for mornings when the calendar makes morning a matter of faith. Her voice did not wobble the way she thought it might. Jess stood behind the counter like a ship\u2019s captain and handed out ginger cookies to anyone who needed their mouth to be busy during grief, which is to say everyone.\n\nThe virtual reality therapist wrote back with a Thursday, and then another, accommodating in the way of people who understand that staying on the horse is more about the horse knowing it will not be asked to do tricks. The office was over a bakery, and the smell of butter and sugar came up the stairwell with a sense of humor. The name on the door read: S. Sen, PhD, and the waiting room had a plant that was not quite alive and chairs that did not make a spectacle of themselves. Dr. Sen was small and carried her seriousness like a shawl that could be unfolded or taken off. She had the kind of bracelets that made a soft, intelligent sound when she gestured. When they sat, she did not turn on a machine or pull out a headset immediately. She asked Ivy to talk about what her fear liked to pretend to be, and when Ivy made a joke, Dr. Sen laughed in a way that suggested she took jokes seriously, which made them feel like something other than deflection.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not begin with a door that shuts,\u201d Dr. Sen said, tapping a thick index card on which she\u2019d written a list that looked like a menu and felt like a dare. \u201cLet\u2019s begin with a place where the sky is close but you have shoes on the ground. Have you been to the aviation museum\u2014the one near Dulles?\u201d\n\n\u201cUdvar-Hazy,\u201d Ivy said, because she had, in a tilting way, years ago with a boyfriend who liked museums like they were gyms for his mind. They had stood under the big belly of the shuttle and he had cried in a newsreel way, while she had read placards about rivets and eaten a pretzel with too much salt.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a cut-through plane you can walk inside,\u201d Dr. Sen said, drawing a little box on the card next to a line that read: Stand in the hollow thing. \u201cAn illusion of enclosure. We can choose when to step in and when to step out. Would that offend you less than being trapped with fifty strangers and a captain?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt offends me at the correct volume,\u201d Ivy said, and watched Dr. Sen tuck, with care, the index card into a folder as if it were a geode to be cracked later for glitter.\n\nThey went on a Wednesday when schools were in but field trip buses still somehow reproduced in that parking lot like cells. Children moved like ideas, darting and unmanageable. The museum was a barn for genius, full of huge suspended animals of metal and muscle, a cathedral with a tin heart. As they crossed the central hall, a man with a microphone gave some shoulders facts they would forget, and a toddler cried with the righteous grief of someone who had been refused a sip of someone else\u2019s soda. Dr. Sen walked half a step behind Ivy, not like a bodyguard, more like a person who did not need to go first. The sectioned plane sat with its seam open to air, the belly exposed in cross-section like a proper anatomy drawing. People walked through it in the casual way you walk into places you are sure will not trap you. The carpet had that gentle, famous dirt of millions of steps on synthetics. The windows were eyes that could not open.\n\n\u201cDo you want to touch it first,\u201d Dr. Sen asked, \u201cor do you want it to touch you?\u201d It was the kind of question that had two right answers. Ivy put her hand flat on the cool metal near the door, very aware of the vastness of the thing attached to this square of atoms. The skin of the plane did not pretend to be anything; it reflected her in a warped way, a woman bent by gloss. Inside, a bored volunteer in a cardigan nodded at them like she was taking attendance at a church she did not belong to. Ivy stepped in because she had promised herself she would once be the kind of person who steps in, and then again later. Her heart did the familiar unhappy horse, but in this room of echoes there was also the sound of children saying look, which she received like a benediction she hadn\u2019t asked for and still needed. Dr. Sen leaned her shoulder into the jamb and did not speak. Ivy stood in the cut of the aisle and looked down at the carpet and then at the windows, which held a view of the parking lot, and then at the front where a gate would be if it were a plane and not a memory of one. She took one breath that counted and then another that might have and then one that did not count at all because it was simply a breath, and then she stepped backward, and then forward again, and the switching did not unmake the day.\n\nOn the way out, she and Dr. Sen stood under the shuttle for the proper amount of awe\u2014its tiles like dragon scales, the burn scars both tidy and brutal. A boy walked by holding a model of a biplane and humming the first six notes of a song meant to make people braver than they were, and Ivy smiled despite herself. In the gift shop she bought Bryce a pencil with a tiny soft airplane eraser he could dismantle while pretending not to care, and she bought herself a postcard of the walkway into a fuselage so she could put it on the fridge and allow it to be not a threat but a postcard. In the parking lot, Dr. Sen said, \u201cYour brain wrote a new sentence,\u201d in the tone of a person announcing a measurable thing, and Ivy thought of all the times her brain had been a poor copyist and wrote this one down with a pen instead.\n\nThe first snow was a coward that melted the minute it thought of staying. Children ran into it with mouths open anyway and let it dissolve on their tongues like a cheap miracle. The second snow arrived with less apology and more intent, and Burke did the suburban arithmetic of kitchen inventory and driveway physics. Jess sent a text in the morning that said: Espresso machine will not survive being moved near the door. I resign myself to tea. Come sit with me and make jokes about footprints. Ivy went and brought her own thermos of something that admitted it was hot leaf water and sat at the window watching the world decide to be softer. When the power flickered at noon and then sighed its way to off across their block, the shop was suddenly a room from a different century, all voice and breath and light from elsewhere. People stayed anyway, because proximity is the power alternative we forget to stock. Jess produced a percolator the size of a hat and two camping stoves like a magician who has planned better than her audience, and Diego appeared with a bag of blankets, the emergency kit of a man who believes in layers. Someone fetched the librarian\u2019s battery-powered lanterns and Maritza turned up like a patron saint with a stack of puzzles missing three pieces each, which is the correct number for community. Ivy sat on the floor with two children whose mother had closed her laptop with a look of absolution and taught them how to draw the floor plan of the shop with the light sources mapped like constellations. \u201cWhere does the warm live when the wires go quiet,\u201d she asked, and they pointed to each other and then to their own chests like small scientists confirming an unlikely theory.\n\nThe airport went hushed in the snow in that eerie way a place made for motion can be arrested and look like prayer. The sky above Burke was a blank page that no one had the nerve to write on. Ivy stood at her window after the soup at Jess\u2019s had been ladled and eaten and held the bowl of her house in her hands. The spruces gathered snow into themselves in white epaulettes; the cut on the one branch wore a pure line of white that looked like a new part rather than an absence. The foxglove had gone dark and quiet, a royal in exile. A cardinal shook himself like someone arriving and was briefly ridiculous and then dignified again. In the silence, she imagined planes landing in places where the government clears them a path and watched her own breath make small temporary clouds. For once the sky\u2019s indifference did not feel like an insult. It felt like a vacation for her nerves.\n\nJanuary asked for promises, and people lied or told tart little truths to their journals. Ivy bought a new calendar because she liked the way months pretended to behave when you put them in boxes. On the first Sunday of the year she wrote call Dad\u2019s friend about the Shakespeare in a slanted hand that looked like it had been to the future and reported back. When their father died, the truck had been sold to a man who liked the idea of it. He had kept the glove compartment book because he said he believed in respecting a talisman, but he hadn\u2019t read it because reading the car\u2019s heart had felt like a trespass. He met Ivy and Ruth at a diner in Lorton that made pancakes like quilts, and he handed over the small battered volume with both hands like it might buck. Ivy put her fingers on the place where their father had written his name in a hand that always looked tipped forward, as if letters for him were running to be heard. They ate their pancakes like a sacrament, with too much syrup and equal amounts of grief. For a moment, in the chrome light of the booth, their father was a person they had built together out of elbows and stories and not a man who had left them too soon to their own wiring.\n\nThe conference video circulated well beyond what she could tolerate watching and then simmered down into the file of \u201cThings People Say We Did\u201d that Maritza kept with the optimism of a record-keeper whose records were always worth keeping. A small library in West Virginia wrote to ask if Ivy would come and do her talk there in the spring, and the ask landed like a bird on the wire inside her\u2014the kind of bird you do not scare away by looking too directly. She wrote back with the truth she was practicing: I am honored. I am also a person who is not flying for a while. If enough people agreed, she could consider driving. The librarian wrote back: We have biscuits. It is a six-hour drive but the scenic route is better. We can pay gas and a small stipend and send you home with jam. The honesty of that felt like a hand without a glove. She left the email starred and did not say yes or no, which counts as discipline for a\nKeane.\n\nThe setback came stupidly, as setbacks will, elbowing its way into a day that had not done anything to deserve it. A story on the radio about a flight diverting for an \u201codor event\u201d lodged in her like a burr after a dog walk, and by the time she pulled into the driveway her heart was employing every employee in the factory for overtime. She sat with her hand on the wheel and forgot for a second how to be in a car, how to be in a body. She called Jess and did not say hello, which was their new permission, and Jess said, \u201cCount the greens,\u201d in a voice that sounded like a hammock. Ivy named the dashboard lights brave, turn signal confident, the moss in the crack by the windshield determined, the neighbor\u2019s recycle bin a shade of frog she could work with. By the time she got to the rosemary that was less green and more something else entirely, the world had righted itself, which is to say she could take her hand off the wheel and not believe she\u2019d fall out of herself. Later, when she told Dr. Sen, the therapist wrote on an index card in neat letters: You rode the horse through the puddle, and underlined the verb because verbs are where the living is.\n\nDiego\u2019s mother came to see the night garden one morning after a shift and spoke to Ivy with the courtesy of someone who had not planned to speak to anyone. Her English had the patience of a person who speaks two languages at work and a third in her head because there are some words for which no language is adequate. She touched the rosemary and said, \u201cMy extra time appointment is still the stairs,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cMine is the river,\u201d and they both looked toward the sky as if grateful and aggrieved. The moonflower had collapsed into a memory, brown and crumpled as an old fan, but the trellis stood like the bones of a promise. \u201cI hate small spaces that do not admit that they are small,\u201d Diego\u2019s mother said, and Ivy thought of the airport bathrooms, of the metal tubes pretending to be friendly. Before she left, the older woman pressed a small foil packet into Ivy\u2019s hand, a tamal still warm, and Ivy ate it at her counter with her head bent the way you bow without intending to, the masa sweet and the meat secret, and felt fed in a way that food rarely manages.\n\nOn a blue day so precise it felt like an equation, she drove to Gravelly Point and sat in the lot with other people who loved noise on purpose. A boy in a puffy jacket threw his arms up every time a plane came low and his father counted down like a launch, the two of them making joy into a homework assignment that anyone would have liked to complete. Ivy watched one land and then another, and the bodies of the planes looked like muscle memory, the tires kissing the ground with an honesty that surprised her every time. After a few, she opened the door and let the cold hit her straight in the chest, a slap that felt not unkind. She stood beside the car and let the shadow of a jet pass over her like a traveling thought, and when the sound came it shoved the air through her in a way that left her opened rather than broken. She thought she might cry\u2014out of fear or relief, she could not yet decide\u2014but her face stayed on the job and her eyes watered for their own boring reasons, and a kid clapped his mittened hands as if she were a trick. After the third plane she got back in the car and laughed in that breathless way of a person finding herself both ridiculous and fine. She texted Jess a photo of her sneaker toe on the painted white line of the parking lot and wrote: Under the path. Jess sent back a single teacup and then, after a second, a second teacup, because some jokes are better true.\n\nWinter gathered itself and unspooled. Ruth made herself take the elevator twice a week in a building where stairs had been hidden as if exercise were a shame, and called Ivy from between floors one day and whispered, \u201cIt sang,\u201d and Ivy whispered back, \u201cSinging is not always for us,\u201d and they both held the phones to their ears like shells and listened to the sea of the other\u2019s breath. Bryce arrived at the library with a report on Amelia Earhart that had a paragraph about getting lost that was so beautiful Ivy photocopied it and put it in her folder of reminders of why she does what she does. He had written, in a new hand: Maybe the world looks for us too. Amina cried quietly over a romance novel cover that finally understood that brown girls have more than one feeling, and surrendered the last nine percent of her disdain for the genre, a fraction Ivy believed deserved to be recorded. Mason bought a label maker and the labels proliferated into jokes, Jars, Jars II, Jars: The Reckoning, and then he labeled a drawer Fame and no one opened it because no one wanted to know what he had put inside fame.\n\nThere was a day, in mid-February, when the coffee shop\u2019s espresso machine finally decided to become art and stopped making coffee as a matter of conscience. Jess set a HAND-POURED ONLY sign that made people treat their orders like confessions. An airline pilot came in again with his cap in his elbow and a box of doughnuts with glossy icing that had not been made by anyone who cared about subtlety. He recognized Ivy, and his mouth made a consideration. \u201cYou from the other day,\u201d he said, and she nodded. \u201cHow\u2019s the, you know.\u201d He wiggled his fingers in the air like a magician who had forgotten the trick. She held a measuring spoon and said, \u201cVariable,\u201d and he grinned like a man who had watched weather for a living. He stood for a long minute and also did not say the word turbulence, which felt to Ivy like love. He told them without telling them a story about the way air sits over mountains like a pot cover and you have to slip the lid when steam gets big ideas. She did not hate him, not even a little bit.\n\nDr. Sen introduced, on a Tuesday with a fluorescent light that did not know how to be tender, the idea of a hierarchy that looked like a shopping list made by a careful person. Gravelly Point, check. Museum cut plane, check. Airport terminal without a ticket, stand and leave, check. Walk up to the glass at Reagan and let the smell of coffee and moving belts be annoying instead of mortal. Maybe\u2014this one placed in the margin like a whisper\u2014ride the shuttle bus from long-term parking to the terminal without getting off at any gate. \u201cWe\u2019ll call the bus a smart chair,\u201d Dr. Sen said, making a shape in the air that could have been a rectangle or a door or a possibility. \u201cYou sit in the thing that moves and you decide when you\u2019re done with deciding.\u201d Ivy nodded and thought of every shuttle she had ridden in the history of her life, all of them suddenly recast as comfortable beasts rather than traps.\n\nThey tried it on a day that felt like the inside of a paper bag. When the shuttle pulled up, its orange LED letters blinking SPECIAL EVENT as if the day were one, she stepped in and felt the floor bounce and then settle. The driver had a face like a story you don\u2019t tell until after dessert and drove with a competence that made her want to applaud. She sat by the window and watched the rows of cars go by like polite armies. The bus door sighed, the kneeling function announced itself with a whine, and people got on with luggage that revealed who they were better than their faces. A grandmother with a blanket that held the pattern of someone else\u2019s baby. A man who had packed like he feared the world would not have his brand of soap. A teen who wore ankle socks with cartoon eggs and stared at the floor with the intensity of a person negotiating a treaty with themselves. When the shuttle reached the loop and the glass mouth of the terminal yawned open, Ivy stayed seated and rode the circle back around. The driver glanced in the rearview, met her eyes in the way of someone who has seen everything and will make no news of the doing, and raised his hand in a little salute. On the third lap, she got off, stood under the overhang where everyone pretended to wait for someone else, and then got back on. She rode one more time for the principle of it. On the way home, she laughed at herself with less cruelty than she once would have employed.\n\nThe night-blooming garden slept in a way that made sleep look like a career. Diego showed up with a shovel over his shoulder one afternoon in a green so gray you could taste it, and said, \u201cThe school wants a demonstration garden. You will talk and I will do my impression of a responsible adult,\u201d and she said yes because she liked being the person people called when a room needed a sentence it didn\u2019t have yet. They stood with a trio of teachers in puffy coats that made them look like marshmallows with doctorate degrees, and Ines arrived with a roll of orange string and an air of command, and carved rectangles from the lawn with the delicacy of surgery. Ivy talked about roots and kids listened with the faces they reserve for information that may try to be relevant. She told them that seeds contain dark and later in equal amounts and that the trick is to wait for the later without burning the dark. She said it out loud and thought, without melodrama, that she was telling herself the same.\n\nOn a Sunday with a blue so insistent it felt paid for, Ruth asked Ivy to come to her office and meet the elevator without rancor. They stood in the marble lobby under a potted plant that had gotten too big for its own myths. Ruth pressed the button like a woman who had negotiated with worse and the elevator arrived with an apology. They got in and the doors shut and the feeling that you are made of cotton and electricity came, and Ivy watched the floor numbers tick and said in her head, kitchen table, spice drawer, bookshelf, rosemary, and the door opened and they were on eight. They got back in and rode to three and then up to ten and did not get out except once when a man with a suitcase and no patience needed their reality so he could do his. On the fourth ride, Ivy laughed in spite of herself at the ridiculousness of calling a box a dragon. Ruth laughed too. They did five rides and then went to Ruth\u2019s office and found a bowl of stale mints and pretended to enjoy them because sometimes pretending is politeness to the part of you that asks you to get into a moving thing and not die.\n\nIn late February a boy from Amina\u2019s chemistry class tried to impress her by making a volcano in the library with baking soda and vinegar he called a demonstration, and Ashlee from the front desk had to call building services with a voice that could sand wood. Ivy told him about how reactions sometimes need smaller bowls, and he looked at her as if she hadn\u2019t recognized the grandeur of his science, and later that week he brought her a note that said, in a penmanship that told the truth about his patience: Sorry I was extra. She kept it because the exactness of the language charmed her more than she liked being charmed by teenagers, which already happened too often for someone who wanted to be thought of as skeptical by at least one person per day.\n\nWind got up a tantrum in March. It leaned on the spruces like a boy in a bad mood and rattled the storm windows enough to make Ivy think of bolts again and then of how bolts, too, could be inspected. Maritza organized a small field trip to the Air and Space museum in the city for the older library kids because fairness demanded that if Ivy got to be brave, so did someone else. Amina refused to board the bus until she had a window seat and Mason brought snacks packaged like secrets. Bryce, now scaled up in both inches and opinion, sat across the aisle and read about Bernoulli with the suspicion of someone meeting an ancestor. In the exhibit with the planets hung like chandeliers, Ivy let the children walk ahead and stepped into a corner where the light dimmed on purpose. Her body did its scan like a TSA agent who had learned your habits and could be paternal about it, and this time she told herself a story that landed without injury. The story went like this: we are lucky and also terrified. The story went like this: other people built this and made it safe enough for me to loiter beside foolishness. When they were done, the bus breathed the kids back onto Burke like a gentle dragon, and Bryce, without preamble, said, \u201cDo you think birds think it\u2019s ridiculous that we try?\u201d and Ivy opened her mouth and then closed it because the answer mattered too much to be casual.\n\nThe ferry extended itself in April, offering a route up to Georgetown, and Jess texted at eight in the morning with a photo of the schedule and the words Misspent adulthood is a choice, and Ivy looked at her calendar and at the rosemary and at the pile of papers on the table that would be fine later, and said yes because saying yes had become a muscle she wanted to keep limber. The water was too cold for arrogance. The boat cracked through the air with a music that had gotten into her bones enough to feel helpful. The river was made of other rivers, and every time she looked toward the city she could see a different age, this one with fancy restaurants, that one with warehouses, another with canoes made by people who never called it the Potomac. The wind did what it wanted with her hair and she did not perform neatness. When they docked, they ate something on a stick from a food truck and laughed at men in suits whose feet were not prepared for cobbles. On the return trip, the wake behaved itself, the captain had the hands of someone who could make soup, and the afternoon took off its shoes.\n\nOne night, not long after, Ivy stood in her kitchen with the OKAY mug and looked at the glove compartment Shakespeare on the counter, the cover worn, the pages the color of cookies. She opened at random and found lines about mercy being twice blessed. She said them out loud, alone, with the force of a person who knows the audience is sometimes the room she stands in and whatever else is listening. She thought of the boy in Austin learning to like boats that did not steal. She thought of Kyle and his crutch and his embarrassed humility. She thought of Maritza writing More Reading, Less Apologizing and meaning it with all her cartilages. She thought of Jess with her burned hand and her braid and her opera singer machine. She thought of Diego on rooftops and in gardens and in rooms where grant applications asked him to put a number on his devotion and he tried anyway.\n\nIn bed that night, Burke\u2019s low orchestra of machines thrummed: refrigerators, the hum of people sleeping, the late plane angling for the runway with its belly lights, the heat knocking like a polite ghost. She lay on her back and put her hand on her chest and ran inventory: lungs, heart, muscle, the little faithful electricity that had not abandoned her even when she had thought she deserved the dark. She considered the fact of how far a person can go without leaving the county and thought it might be farther than she had been taught to admit. A map is a lie if it does not show the house. The day folded its corners and went into the drawer. She dreamed not of planes or ferries but of a long hallway with windows on one side and paintings on the other and her own footsteps a reliable drum, and in the morning she woke with the residue of the dream in her hair and did not shake it out.",

The email remained starred in her inbox like a polite dare. Fresh flyers for the library program curled slightly on the edges from humidity. The rosemary at her door had shrugged off winter with the smugness of a plant that never planned to die. On a Tuesday when the sky was the color of old paper and the planes moved like commas, she pressed call on the number in the email and told a woman named Nina that she would drive.\n\nNina laughed in a way that made biscuits seem inevitable. \u201cYou\u2019ll like the road better than you think,\u201d she said. \u201cIt forgives. And we are on the other end with jam and folding chairs that complain.\u201d\n\nDr. Sen approved the plan with the satisfaction of someone who enjoys a graph of progress and also knows better than to draw a straight line. She wrote a list on an index card in the tidy handwriting of a person whose pens never wander: coffee, map that is not a phone, two songs you can breathe to, a place you will pull over on purpose. \u201cIt is a ministry to future-you when present-you makes hammocks,\u201d she said, and Ivy went home and set the OKAY mug in the sink to dry like a superstition and packed the glove compartment with her father\u2019s battered Shakespeare because talismans enjoy continuity.\n\nRuth produced a fanny pack with the gravitas of a general issuing arms. \u201cSnacks. Dramamine you won\u2019t take. Bail money.\u201d She tucked in a small container of pistachios and the terrible mints from her desk for tradition. Jess, who felt abandoned by the notion of a day without their usual truce coffee, braided her hair excessively and tucked a note into Ivy\u2019s jacket pocket that said, in a looping, adolescent hand: If a bridge looks at you wrong, look back nicer.\n\nShe left at six in the morning, before Burke had decided on its mood. The car was a small room she liked, smelling faintly of oranges and old library glue. She drove past the rec center field where the goal nets hung like unmade beds and the spruces that had forgiven a winter\u2019s wind. At the end of the block, she made the kind of right turn that always felt like a conversation with destiny and breathed once out loud because it seemed polite to show the air what it was for.\n\nThe beltway unscrolled like a film strip that had been repaired one too many times. Down along the river, the morning made a show of itself on the water, flinging light like a toddler with glitter. She passed the airport, its glass faced toward the east, and gave it the respectful nod she might give a person she was not ready to make eye contact with. The road toward Leesburg was a long shrug. She took it. Somewhere outside Hamilton, the air turned into something you could drink. The land undulated in the controlled, practiced way of a person in a yoga class who has been doing yoga for years and refuses to brag about it.\n\nHarpers Ferry rose up in front of her like a fold in the map someone had smoothed and then reconsidered. The confluence of the rivers did their performance, brown and green braiding without asking for applause. Ivy parked on a street that made parallel parking look like a demonstration sport and got out to stand for a minute near a railing that someone had painted blue with half a heart. A train crossed the water on a trestle that looked too delicate and proved itself anyway. She felt the old flutter in the bones and told herself the story of how bridges hold because they are held. An older couple in denim jackets walked past, the man holding a dog that did not want to be carried the way you hold a baby that does not want a bath. \u201cMorning,\u201d the woman said, one of those southern syllables that leaves the mouth like a quilt. Ivy answered, added, \u201cThis is not a bad place to gather yourself,\u201d and the woman said, \u201cWhen the rivers comport themselves, I can behave myself.\u201d\n\nShe chose the scenic route like a person choosing an argument with herself and finding she liked the sound of her own case. The road began to collect trees that did not feel the need to apologize for their opinions. She was not fond of tunnels, and when the GPS\u2019s bland voice suggested a shortcut through rock she took the exit onto the old road that sidled around the mountain with a confidence that required none of hers. The car climbed and the horizon opened and the guardrails attempted to reassure. In a turnout with a view that instructed you to shut up, she pulled over on purpose because future-Ivy had been given that gift by present-Ivy. She ate half a pistachio and saw it for what it was\u2014an offering to the gods of small triumphs\u2014and then took two more because generosity can be taught.\n\nAt a diner that had not removed its Christmas lights in three years because nobody asked it to, she ate a biscuit that was an unapologetic part of the local religion and jam that had ideas about strawberries. The waitress called her honey without sarcasm. A man at the counter in a ball cap that had chosen its stains walked her through the proper route to avoid the one-wheeled road work. \u201cThey\u2019re improving a bridge that isn\u2019t broke,\u201d he said. \u201cWe love to punish what hasn\u2019t failed yet.\u201d He asked where she was headed, and when she told him a library name he nodded, a man who believed in buildings with quiet hours. He did not ask why she was going. She did not offer to explain.\n\nThe library in West Virginia was a brick promise held up by mismatched pillars. Inside, the floor gave a little in the spots everyone used. Banners in construction paper and ambition draped above the circulation desk. A girl of about nine with hair arranged to suggest blueberry pie handed Ivy a name tag made in a careful hand that had decided what an I should look like and stuck with it. Nina materialized with a professional\u2019s arms full of clipboards and a face that suggested she wanted everyone to feel like they had done a brave thing by coming. She smelled like flour and toner. \u201cJam,\u201d she announced, leading Ivy as if they were running a gentle heist, and held up a jar with a handwritten label that read, Summer, saved.\n\nThe room filled in the way rooms do when everyone has been taught to sit down before the story starts. A man with suspenders that insisted on their job. Two teenagers accompanied by their grudges and their respective grandmothers. A woman who had a baby sleeping on her chest in the way that says the day will go as it wishes. In the second row, a boy wore a T-shirt with a plane on it that made Ivy\u2019s ribs do their honest tap dance and then quiet. When Nina introduced her, it was with the sentence Ivy had come to believe might be the kindest to give a person: \u201cShe is learning something and wanted to tell you about it while it was still learning.\u201d\n\nShe spoke. She tried to use the words care and map and small without making them feel like a cop-out. She told them about the boy who wanted to go big at home and the girl who drew a river that knew exactly where it was going until it ran out of blue crayon. She told them about the ferry that did not pretend to be the sky, and the night-blooming garden that refused to show off for anyone who didn\u2019t wait. She said, \u201cSometimes courage does not want its picture taken,\u201d and in the front row, a woman in a T-shirt advertising a hardware store said \u201camen,\u201d not loudly, but with the muscle of that word behind it. When she told them the teacups sentence, which had become both a joke and a sacrament, someone near the back held up an actual ceramic cup as if they had been waiting for authorization.\n\nAfter, a man who had lived seventy-two years in the county asked whether it was a kind of sin to have never left. Ivy thought of all the maps that leave out the house and said, \u201cIf your feet and your attention have traveled, the world has been moved,\u201d which was a line she had not heard before it arrived in her mouth. The boy in the plane T-shirt lingered until everyone had taken their jam and their folding chairs had concluded their complaints. He handed her a drawing of a plane that looked less like a machine and more like the idea of a bird wearing a necklace. \u201cI like the shuttle,\u201d he said, his voice slanted so that sarcasm could not find it, \u201cthe one that looks burned because it worked.\u201d She nodded and asked him what he thought fire learned when it made marks and he said, \u201cNot to brag,\u201d and she thought of the tiles, those squares of stubborn.\n\nThe road back did not hold anything against her. In a town that also had a street named Main, she stopped at a small airport with a sign that said Visitors Welcome in a font of a certain faith. It was a runway with an opinion and a line of hangars that had decided not to be glamorous. A man with a face that sun had not asked permission of leaned on a propeller that did not look like a piece of violence in that light. He had the taste of aviation in his vowels. In the lounge, which was a room with folding chairs and a coffee maker that had its own calendar, a woman in a windbreaker with a stitched name offered Ivy coffee like a doctor offering pills. \u201cYou flying?\u201d the woman asked, as if that was a thing people often were. \u201cNo,\u201d Ivy said, and then, because the word felt like a lie when the air tasted this friendly, \u201cNot today.\u201d\n\nThe flight instructor had a way of standing with his feet apart as if the ground might try something. He asked nothing that required a biography. \u201cYou want to sit?\u201d he said, gesturing toward a Cessna that had been built with more sincerity than glamour. The door opened with a sound like permission, and she climbed in because her body had been trained by a woman with bracelets to try a door when it is open. The cockpit smelled like dust with credentials. The headset hung there like an old idea. The world outside was a model; a truck moved through a small choreography on the road beyond the fence. She put her hands in her lap because she did not want to touch a thing that meant it. The instructor pointed with two fingers at the yoke and said, \u201cSome people think it wants to be gripped. Turns out it likes a confident hand that doesn\u2019t insist.\u201d She nodded because she had lived with fear that was the opposite of that. Her breath did the horse and then did the thing horses do when they realize the barn is not on fire. She stayed three minutes and then seven and then a small while longer than she would have believed possible the year before, and when she climbed down her legs behaved.\n\nBack in Burke the dogwoods put up their little handkerchiefs, and Mason lined the bulletin board with fliers that had fonts so aligned they could have gone out in public unashamed. The rain garden at the high school found its own purpose quickly; a storm came and the hole filled, and the boys in hoodies watched water behave itself and had the decency to applaud. Ines labeled a second round of plants with a wicked joy, sneaking Latin into people\u2019s heads like contraband. Bryce began to like footnotes and then pretended not to, and Amina rolled her eyes the exact number of times required to maintain her identity while sneaking audiobooks like snacks.\n\nThe bridge in the park\u2014the small footbridge over the part of the creek that liked to jump its banks without warning\u2014had been taken from the graveyard of bureaucratic ideas and returned to use. It was not much, which is what made it dignified. On a Saturday that thought about rain and decided against it, people gathered to call it good news. Kyle stood at an awkward angle that made his crutch unnecessary and also made habit hard to break, and read from a piece of paper he had written in block letters. He said things like stewardship and partnership and residents, and then he looked up and said, \u201cWe decided not to punish what isn\u2019t failing,\u201d which is the kind of sentence a man should be congratulated for saying out loud into a microphone. Maritza held a ribbon that had been cut by children before and had the nicks to show it. Jess refused the scissors and handed them to Ivy, turning her gently toward the creek. \u201cYou are our hinge,\u201d she whispered, as if it were a recipe you couldn\u2019t write down.\n\nThey called it the Hinge. It was not official\u2014no plaque\u2014just the way the people who used it decided to refer to it in sentences that were shorthand for care. Diego and a small crew of teenagers, some of whom believed in plants and some of whom believed in Diego, had tucked sedges and blue flag iris into the mud near the abutments. The plants looked like commas, not yet insisting on their point. Children chalked maps down the path to the kiosk where Mason had stationed a folding table with clipboards because nothing in the world made him happier than handing someone an important rectangle. Ivy cut the ribbon in a line, not with flourish, the way you cut the twine on a box you hope contains something that will not make more work for you. The creek approved in its fashion, throwing itself politely at the rocks and then reconsidering.\n\nAt the library, Nina from West Virginia wrote to say that two kids had stayed after the talk to draw teacups and label them with bravery. She attached a photo of the jam shelf, now with a new line of jars labeled Later in black Sharpie. Ivy printed the email and put it in her folder with Bryce\u2019s paragraph about being found by the world. The folder grew to the thickness of a thin book and she wondered whether a person\u2019s competence could be measured in paper.\n\nDr. Sen\u2019s index cards gathered into a small, stern stack. The next one suggested a reconnaissance mission to the airport terminal without the magic trick of the shuttle bus\u2014walk in under the glass, smell the coffee and the moving belt optimism, buy gum you don\u2019t need, watch people find their gates, leave when you decide the leaving. Jess offered to go and then took it back without Ivy asking, saying she would rather be the person who waited at a table with two chairs. Ivy went on a Thursday morning when the air had the quality of paper after a too-hot bath. The parking garage clicked past like cards in a dealer\u2019s hand. The sign that read Terminal had the confidence of a pronouncement. The automatic doors took her without asking permission and the cool inside air laid a hand on her arm like a nurse. It smelled like coffee and someone else\u2019s anxiety. She put her fingertips on the railing of the escalator and refused to think about hands. A family with matching T-shirts that read Cousin Trip placed themselves around her like human padding; a toddler in a stroller wore a hat like an orange boat and brandished a spoon.\n\nShe stood by a pillar and read the sign that told you what to do with your baggage if you had made one reservation and then thought better of it. She watched a woman in a suit who had learned how to walk and talk at the speed of commerce break off from her phone long enough to kiss a child\u2019s head. She watched two twenty-year-olds wearing backpacks the size of idiocy argue about a snack they had not bought and then hug, their anger turned to relief with the speed of youth. She watched a man in a wheel chair receive the kind of attention all bodies should receive on neutral days. She breathed two acceptable breaths and then one that startled her, and the horse inside her looked at her over its shoulder because it had learned she could be trusted sometimes. She bought gum and threw it away later, a ritual that pleased some mean spirit in her who liked waste to be implicated in healing. She left without announcing it to anyone and sat in her car and put her head down on the steering wheel like someone at a revival from a faith without a name. \u201cLater,\u201d she said to herself and to the sky and to the small singing sound the exit barrier made when it lifted.\n\nThe foxglove in her yard germinated in half a dozen unlikely places, ringing small future bells in soil she had not remembered disturbing. Diego claimed credit for the extent to which the garden had decided to look deliberate, which charmed her because it meant he wanted to be responsible for good accidents. He had a teenager following him like a shadow\u2014Carlos, with a mustache determined to audition for permanence\u2014who listened with an attention Ivy found rare in boys and more rare in those with phones. Carlos paused by the Hinge to take a sequence of photographs at dawn and then sent them to Ivy without comment, the creek in those images making a promise she would hold it to.\n\nMay pushed its sleeves up and applied itself to its work. The kids at the library turned in projects that betrayed their parents\u2019 sleeplessness and their own glitter loyalties. Amina began her annual period of pretending the end of school did not matter while buying three new black eyeliners that absolutely mattered. Mason put a countdown on the staff whiteboard and then erased it because watching numbers become smaller made him edgy about endings. Maritza convinced the county to let her open the big meeting room on Fridays for something called Quiet Riot, a name that pleased her so much she laughed every time she wrote it in an email. In the room, teenagers lay on the carpet and read and pretended not to notice that other teenagers they had decided to want were reading in proximity, and sometimes one of them would fall asleep and snore and then wake up embarrassed and an old woman in the genealogy section would clap twice quietly, their communal grandmother.\n\nRuth began to dream disturbingly mundane dreams about office chair casters and woke to find herself grateful to be bored in that way. She and Ivy chose a Sunday to drive to the Shenandoah, to watch the river be itself without making metaphors of it. They stood at an overlook where a historical plaque told the truth about fighters and victors and someone had carved a heart into the wooden rail with a tool that had wanted to be a knife when it grew up. Ruth put her hand on the carved heart as if it had a pulse, and Ivy said, \u201cHe would have liked the curve,\u201d and they both meant their father, who had believed in vistas as proof that suffering lacked imagination.\n\nThe city announced the water taxi schedule to Georgetown with optimism matched by the weather, and Jess, refusing to accept that adulthood meant being sensible about weeknights, devised a plan that involved a boat, a late dinner, and the kind of walk that convinces blisters to become character. The boat yielded to them the way it does for those who have introduced themselves correctly\u2014firm handshake, no boasting. They ate skewered things on a bench at the edge of water that had ideas about both past and future. On the way back, the air laid its cool across the back of Ivy\u2019s neck in a way that made sleep, later, feel like a gift she did not have to pay for. A plane came in high and busy. She watched it without inventing a backstory for the pilot or the person in 23A. She let it be a moving light, yelling without volume, and it was good enough.\n\nIn early June, Nina sent a photo of a new library sign\u2014hand-painted letters that said Courage is a trickle, and the artist had made a caricature teacup that looked more like a boot. Ivy laughed and then cried and then laughed because her body had decided to enjoy its new capacity for both-and. The West Virginia boy in the plane T-shirt wrote a postcard with a picture of a bridge and an arrow pointing at it labeled This does not move and that is fine. She put it on the fridge next to the cow in boots and the OKAY magnetized into place.\n\nThe county fair arrived in \u201970s colors and sounds arranged by parents who once believed in arcades and cotton candy. Ivy did not intend to go. She found herself walking anyway after dinner when the sky made a promise she didn\u2019t require it to keep. The Ferris wheel turned itself simple on the horizon. Jess appeared with a bag of kettle corn big enough to shelter a small child and offered it like a sacrifice. Diego showed up seconds later from a different direction because towns have the same gravity at night, with Ines and Carlos in tow, and Ines rolled her eyes at the suspect watering practices of a sad set of potted geraniums near a concession stand. They ambled the way people do when the alternative is to go home and clean a thing that does not need cleaning.\n\nThey stood beneath the Ferris wheel as cars rose and lowered like breathing, watching the line of people who had consented to the idea. A gentleman of a certain confidence offered to let them cut in because he had four teenaged boys and had achieved benevolence by sheer survival; they declined. Ivy looked up and did the inventory she had learned to do\u2014bolts, joints, repetition, the notches that hold, the bored teenage operator who knows the music before it plays\u2014and felt the sharp in her ribs that had learned to be more interesting than simply pain. \u201cNot today,\u201d she said to the tilt of her blood and to Jess\u2019s braid and to the thin cloud that had landed over the moon like a joke. \u201cEvery day we decide something,\u201d Jess said, popping a kernel into her mouth with religious fervor. \u201cYou chose the ground and I am not mad at it.\u201d Diego pointed to a set of prize-winning hogs with a tenderness that suggested the beginning of a folk song and then bought lemonade and handed Ivy the first sip in an act so simple it rearranged some small thing you would have to be an instrument to hear.\n\nSummer moved in with the arrogance of someone bringing a duffel and no rent money. The library filled with the bureaucracy of fun. Maritza discovered a grant for mobile shelves and Mason designed a schedule that made block parties look like foreplay. Amina convinced three teen volunteers to read a romance by giving them each the task of finding the argument that made the kiss necessary; two wrote papers and one pretended not to care but returned the book with a page creased at exactly the right place. Bryce, taller and slightly gentled by his own growth, came to Ivy with news of a summer program for kids who like to build bridges with popsicle sticks and real math. He stood in the doorway and failed at casual. \u201cI applied,\u201d he said, looking at a spot two inches to the left of her face. \u201cI told them I am good at pretending bridges work until they do.\u201d She turned her head so his eyes landed where they might mean to and said, \u201cYou are.\u201d\n\nThe footbridge\u2014Hinge\u2014became background even in its newness, which is to say it had done its job perfectly. Parents stood on it with cups of coffee and argued in voices softened by the sound of water. Children ran across it like deadline met. Teenagers lingered at its center pretending not to be in love. One evening, Ivy went there alone because it was the end of a day that had asked for one more thing and she had refused it on purpose. She leaned both her forearms on the railing and looked hard at the rock where on some days a turtle came to moralize with its presence. A plane tugged at the sky toward the airport, the red light blinking a Morse code she did not need to translate. She raised two fingers toward it because small ceremonies have decided to adopt her. The creek pushed itself over a shallow tongue of stone and made a sound that could have been language if you wanted it to be. Behind her, someone\u2019s wind chime insisted and then apologized and then insisted again.\n\nWhen she went home, there was a flyer stuck to her door with blue painter\u2019s tape because the town refused to give up its delivery method. It was for the opening of the school rain garden, with the students listed as if they had played starring roles in a film. Ines\u2019s name was there with a small crown drawn above it by someone who knew better than to pretend she was not in charge. On the fridge, the magnets conspired to make a small museum: the cow in boots, the OKAY mug picture, the boy\u2019s bridge and its caption not moving as a virtue, a shopping list that included laundry soap, an unreadable scribble that she thought might be remind pirates they can swim. She added a line, or let it add itself through her, the way some sentences arrive: drive west again. Under it, as if to temper the ambition, she wrote in small letters, rosemary, lemon, teacups, and then she went to bed with the window cracked and the fan spinning like a well-meaning argument. The night did what it does, which is to collect and give back in equal measures, and somewhere over the county line a plane took off with its small intentions and did not ask her to approve.\n\nThe rain garden opening took place under a sky that felt like a lesson in being generous without flooding. The principal wore a tie decorated with pencils and the calm of a man who had learned to move chairs without anyone asking. The strip of former lawn had transformed into a polite swamp that looked as if it had always intended to be useful. Purple spikes of iris nodded as if they were considering office hours. Labels, required by Ines\u2019s personal constitution, told the truth about Latin and lineage. The teenagers stood with their hands in their pockets, a stance that means triumph and terror in equal measure. Diego said, \u201cWater in a hurry should learn to slow down somewhere,\u201d and Ivy said, \u201cSo should we,\u201d and someone from the county took a picture that would be put into a newsletter no one would read and that would make the work look small; the living thing under it would make that a lie.\n\nJuly arrived with the smell of asphalt and sunscreen and the particular joy of the air-conditioning that breaks and then, hallelujah, returns. Ivy applied her list-making to the program days the way a person applies salve to a burn, with tenderness and insistence. The ferry ran its route like a metronome. Jess\u2019s machine threw only one tantrum and was coaxed back by someone rubbing the gasket with olive oil named after a saint. The boy in Austin sent a drawing of a ferry with a pull-out section labeled therapist, and she laughed and put it above the stove where steam could give it a benign wave.\n\nOn a day too hot for metaphor, Ivy drove again to the small airport with the windblown lounge and walked, without making a plan, toward the fence where you can stand and watch the runway without being interesting to security. The Cessnas waggled their wings and the brothers of the Cessnas did their gentleman\u2019s taxi. The flight instructor from the spring lifted a hand as if he had been expecting her and then went on tugging a wheel like a dull kindness. She put her fingers through the chain link and did not think of prison. She thought of nets. She watched a student pilot float higher than her intentions and then remember them, bumping the ground with a humility she recognized. She stayed until she felt the small loosening that told her she had done the correct amount of exposure for a Thursday. In the tiny shop that sold things like earplugs and improbable romance between airplanes and calendars, she bought a patch with a plane embroidered in such bad color she adored it, and later at home she sewed it into the lining of her jacket where only she would know it lived.\n\nAt night, when the crickets had not yet given themselves to August\u2019s competition and the heat pressed like an attention-seeking cat, she lay on her back on the rug of her front room and watched the ceiling fan do its dignified job. The house breathed with her, the lath behind the plaster making its small nocturnal noises of accommodation. Somewhere a teenager laughed in a way that made a parent check their watch. The foxglove slept with the arrogance of the entirely necessary. The rosemary turned its small spines toward the window and held the smell of courage like a gossip it would never share. She thought of a line deep in the sonnets about exile and mercy, and she decided not to go find it, trusting instead that it would arrive when it needed to. The day had not asked her to get on a plane. She had not been required to be a spectacle for her own bravery. The ground had matched her feet, and that matching made a kind of music she was just beginning to hear. She closed her eyes with a practiced immodesty and let sleep do the work it wanted to do\u2014repair, archive, erase, and leave a few files open for morning when she would stand again at the rosemary and say, because she enjoyed the stubbornness of habits that do no harm, \u201cOkay.\u201d",
